Cox/Getty Images Timothy Rapp   Free-agent middle linebacker Paul Worrilow reportedly agreed to a deal with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport . Dave Birkett of the Detroit Free Press reported Worrilow will receive a one-year deal from the Lions. Enter-Sports Management confirmed the agreement. Standout rookie Deion Jones supplanted Worrilow, 26, as the Atlanta Falcons' starting middle linebacker this season, which perhaps led the veteran to seek a starting job elsewhere. The Lions had a significant need at inside linebacker for next season, as Tahir Whitehead, the team's primary starter at the position in 2016, only has one more year remaining on his contract. The addition of Worrilow allows the Lions to put both players on the inside, or they could move Whitehead to the outside and use him as a pass-rusher. Worrilow was productive in his first three seasons, totaling 365 tackles, four sacks and three forced fumbles. The undrafted free agent remained an effective member on special teams in 2016 and took his demotion in stride during the season. \"Any action I can get on the field is exciting,\" Worrilow said in November, per JuliaKate E. Culpepper of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , maintaining a team-first attitude . \"When you’re winning games, and everyone’s in here practicing hard, it’s just awesome.\" Still, his play from earlier in his career suggests he has the ability to be an effective linebacker in the right system. The Lions can only hope he'll solidify the middle of their defense. While Worrilow isn't an elite option at the position, he's also a tireless worker who accumulated a ton of tackles during his first few seasons. He won't amaze with his athleticism or explosion, but he has exceeded expectations to this point in his career. Detroit will be banking on him continuing to grow.
