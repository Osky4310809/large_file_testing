It is a physical impossibility. Zlatan - or The Great Man™, as we like to call him - has the sort of effortless, natural cool that comes to few men. \nThankfully, being the gracious and generous human being he is, The Great Man™ has been kind enough to offer us some idea of what it's like to possess Zlatn-esque levels of awesomeness. \nHow so? By sharing his ridiculously brilliant gym playlist with the rest of the world. \"You're welcome, boys\" \nThe Manchester United striker has his own fashion company, called A-Z, and decided to upload his list of favourite workout tracks on their site. \nAccording to A-Z, \"his playlist is a balance between motivating uptempo tunes and more mellow moments when it’s all about strength and focus.\" \nTake a look at it here (this is a spotify embed, so you can actually click on it), and you will no doubt agree that this is OUTSTANDING: \nYou can see why Zlatan is in such good shape for a 35 year-old. \nWith tunes like these pushing him on in the gym, it's no wonder he's in the shape of his life. Zlatan takes no prisoners in the gym (Photo: Instagram/iamzlatanibrahimovic) \nJay-Z, LL Cool J, Eminem, the theme tune to Bad Boys, Rick Ross… just when you think he's trying a little too hard to be cool, he chucks in a cheesy classic from Vanilla Ice to lighten it up a little. \nClass stuff from The Great Man™. Although we have a feeling his new pal Stormzy is going to be heartbroken when he realises he's not on it… \"Next time, Stormzy. Next time…\" (Photo: Manchester United) Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T16:07:36.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
