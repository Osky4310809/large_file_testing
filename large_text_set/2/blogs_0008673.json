Granted, I could probably arrive with the Dap Kings behind me, but the point still stands. Before the show started he was probably one of the most unknown artists ever nominated for Album of the Year, even James Corden joked in the monologue that no one knows who he is, and when he got up on that stage he had everyone thinking, Oh shit. Who the hell is this? Before the performance started I joked I was gonna throw my underwear at my TV and get my fangirl on and people replied by saying that they didn’t know who he was, but they were about to too. Sturgill Simpson is so good that he had people who “hate country music” liking him. Country is shockingly one of the most divisive genres, people who hate it are locked in to hating it and will never change their mind, the very word “country” has them lunging for the radio dial, but Sturgill even managed to woo some of them. He was that good. \n\nSo welcome, Sturgill. You’re finally welcomed on the big stage. It was long overdue.
