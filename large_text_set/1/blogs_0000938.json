While that might be the case, the U.K. made sure to let Kerry know they were not happy with his speech. \n“We do not … believe that the way to negotiate peace is by focusing on only one issue,” the British Prime Minister’s spokesperson said. “And we do not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically elected government of an ally.” The New York Times reported that May was mostly upset that Kerry called Israel’s current government the “most right-wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements.” As if trying to make peace with Washington, D.C., after May’s surprising comments, the U.K. State Department released a statement of its own. \n“We are surprised by the U.K. Prime Minister’s office statement,” the State Department said, arguing that Kerry’s remarks “were in line with the U.K.’s own longstanding policy and its vote at the United Nations.”   \nKerry’s speech has been the topic of heavy criticism . Even left-leaning publications such as The Washington Post condemned the secretary of state’s remarks. \nThe Post called the speech “long” and “condescending” and blamed an “Israel-bashing” Obama administration for the chaos. \nIt seems as if even President Barack Obama’s own supporters can’t agree with the way he treats his allies. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you thought about John Kerry’s speech.
