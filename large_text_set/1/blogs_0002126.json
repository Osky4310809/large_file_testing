This despite revenue growing around 140% to Rs1,952 crore.\nThe payouts are also from a period when the Bengaluru-based company was facing devaluation and difficulty in raising fresh funds at preferred valuation.\nIn March 2016, investor Morgan Stanley trimmed Flipkart’s valuation by 27% to $11 billion. By April 2016, the company had faced rejections from several potential investors, the Mint newspaper reported .\nNo comparison Flipkart’s fierce rival Amazon India was pretty modest in comparison.\nIn fiscal 2016, the highest-paid employee at Amazon Seller Services, the American company’s main unit in India, was Stephen Walter, the HR director for India and China; Walter got Rs4.29 crore. Amazon’s India head Amit Agarwal received Rs3.16 crore.\nBelow are the 10 highest-paid employees at Amazon Seller Services in fiscal 2016, according to the company’s RoC filing:\nName Designation Age Experience Remuneration\n(in Rs crore) Stephen Walter HR director, India & China 56 32 4.29 Amit Devendra Agarwal VP India, country manager 42 19 3.16 Nitesh Sunder Kripalani Director, Amazon Video India 35 15 2.41 Samir Kumar VP, category management 44 21 2.27 Mahendra Nerurkar GM, Junglee.com 41 18 2.17 Kishore Thota Sr. manager marketing 43 19 1.96 Gopal Pillai Director & general manager, Seller Services 41 20 1.88 Raghava Rao Director finance, India 45 22 1.83 Rajiv M Mehta Country manager, Kindle, India 41 19 1.73 Kinjal Choudhary Director, operations HR India 45 20 1.69 “We do not discuss specifics of employee remuneration as these are confidential but Amazon India remains committed to offering its employees competitive, market-benchmarked salaries with a challenging career path and fulfilling work environment,” an Amazon India spokesperson told Quartz. Flipkart did not respond to an email query.\nIn fiscal 2016, Amazon’s losses and revenue in India more than doubled to Rs3,572 crore and Rs2,275 crore, respectively.\nCorrection: Earlier, the story had erroneously mentioned that Amod Malviya is 25.
