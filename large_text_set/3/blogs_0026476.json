Any appeal of Bale's yellow is unlikely to be successful as FIFA will only change cards based upon a claim of mistaken identity. Gareth Bale will miss Wales' game against Serbia in June. \n\"He [Bale] got the yellow card from a cross, the referee thought he was late,\" he said. \"Again when I'm looking at it, I thought he had to go for it. He's travelling at a great speed, he's got to go for it, he gets a yellow card and he's going to miss the next game. \n\"Is it because it's Gareth Bale? Is it a bit more because it's Gareth Bale? Was it a genuinely bad challenge? If I see it again, I'll apologise to you and say he got it wrong. There's no hint of that in my dressing room. There's not Balo saying, 'I got it wrong.' He wants to appeal the yellow card.'' \nWales might have snatched victory at the death against Ireland when Bale skimmed the post with a curling effort, but Coleman left Dublin relatively satisfied. Wales' fourth Group D draw in a row leaves them four points behind leaders Serbia. \nHe said: \"If you looked at it at the start of the campaign and said to us, 'Would you take a point in the Republic and a point in Austria?,' I'm not so sure I would have said, 'I don't want that.' \n\"It's not so bad, but because we have had draws -- we dropped two points to Georgia at home -- that's been quite significant. But still, there's a long way to go, five games, 15 points, so we'll be leaving here thinking last 20 minutes, it could have been worse for us when for 70 minutes really, we weren't really in any trouble. But it was a good point for us in the end.'' \nInformation from the Press Association was used in this report. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T17:59:47.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
