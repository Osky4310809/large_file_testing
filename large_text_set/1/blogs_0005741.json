Amidst all the rumours of their separation, the two were off lately spotted together at dinner outings and family gatherings. Are they trying to reconcile? Well, Arbaaz, in an interview with a leading daily, talks about separation with his wife in detail. When asked about how the two are coping with the situation, he said, \"Just because we’re separating, doesn’t mean we have to be worried about each other’s equations. I have a child with her, so we have to have a cordial and a great relationship. We’re very amicable with the split we had. I’m close to her side of the family, something that you can all see.\" Arbaaz also added, \"My association with her family has been that of over 21 years, which is almost like a lifetime. I have a growing up child, so there’s a lot of parenting responsibilities and duties we have to do and it can only happen if the atmosphere between the two of us is very conducive and normal. We both are extremely mature and can handle this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T08:07:13.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
