As of about 2 p.m. Wednesday, both quotes were live on Booker’s Facebook and Twitter accounts. \nWe wonder when Booker will “forgive” Trump for his alleged transgressions and return to being the bipartisan golden-boy and future hope for the Democrat Party, because as of right now, he is veering ever-so sharply to the left, and is poised to go off the rails into the morass of progressivism that was just soundly rejected by the American voters in most of the country. \nJust as a reminder to everyone — it is wise to double-check and verify the things you share on social media before you actually post it, lest you end up guilty of spreading “fake news” or false quotes as well. \nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter to let everyone know that Cory Booker is spreading a fake quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin.
