Originally, it was reported last year that tolling operations for the new extension were slated to commence in November 2018, but a date of completion has yet to be announced. \nWhen ready, the open-toll, three-lane dual carriageway will be 18 km-long and will provide a mainline connection between the existing Lebuhraya Maju Expressway (MEX, or E20) to Lebuhraya KLIA (FT26). The route will commence at Putrajaya Interchange and merge onto the FT26 in Sepang. \nAside from the usual entry and exit ramps to and from the expressway, there will be 26 bridges along the route, and MEX II will feature one mainline toll plaza, two ramp toll plazas and a supervision building.
