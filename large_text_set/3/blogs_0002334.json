KP, I know I'm a little late but we would be one heck of a power couple! @katyperry #SuperBowlBae \n— Trevor Knight (@trevor_knight9) February 2, 2015 \nDuring an October 2014 taping, Perry, the week’s “guest picker,” held up a heart-shaped sign adorned with Knight’s face and urged the then-Sooners star to call her. Knight said he was watching the show when Perry mentioned him, but he had a girlfriend at the time and never took action. \n“Blake Bell plays for the 49ers now and was my roommate,” said Knight, who transferred to A&M last summer for his senior season. “(Perry) did the shout out or whatever, and I’ve never seen (Blake) — he’s 6-6, 265, and he’s jumping on the bed going crazy. I realized, then, when my phone started to buzz uncontrollably, that I needed to turn it off and get ready for the game.” \n— Oklahoma Football (@OU_Football) October 4, 2014 \nA few hours later, Oklahoma, then No. 4, was upset by 25th-ranked TCU. \n“I wish we would have won that game because you could have played it up a little bit more,” Knight said. “But it’s fun nonetheless.” \nFortunately, Knight didn’t stay down in the dumps too long. He went on to date “Duck Dynasty” star Sadie Robertson, but the couple broke up in September. As it happens, Perry reportedly split with her boyfriend, actor Orlando Bloom, this week. So there’s an argument to be made that now is the time for him to take another shot. \nBut with the Combine and an NFL career on deck, Knight seems to think it’s best to leave his fleeting romance with Perry in the past. \n“College football is great for so many reasons, and that’s part of it,” Knight said. “You’ve got four to five years to have fun and enjoy the fame, for lack of a better term, of what being a college football player is all about. And that was just one of the few instances where I got to have a little fun on social media.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:30:25.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
