If they see that we are competitive, everybody is ready to win things together and they know how important they are for our team, then this will make their decision easier.” \nWhile much of the attention before and during the current transfer window has focused on possible outgoings at Arsenal, there is still plenty of time for fresh faces to be brought on board. \nWenger, though, has admitted of late that he is unlikely to enter a tricky mid-season market. \nHe said: “I believe it's completely against the spirit of what a football club should be. \n“Once you are on the train at the start of a season, you stay on the train until the end of the season. I personally don't think that it is right.” \nCech believes Arsenal already boast a healthy strength in depth and will have no complaints if Wenger decides to follow his recent recruitment trend and steer clear of January additions. \nOzil: I'm very comfortable in London \nHe added: “On Saturday [against Swansea] we were missing players due to injury and so they are all basically close to fitness and back to the squad, apart from Santi [Cazorla], who will need a little bit more time. \n“If everyone is fit then we have a strong squad. So this is probably why the boss said what he said. It is his decision. We concentrate on our game and then we train. If he brings in a player or not, that is his decision.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T18:23:49.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
