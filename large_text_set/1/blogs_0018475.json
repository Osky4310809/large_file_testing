The team is reportedly considering Marc Trestman. \nWith former Rams offensive coordinator Rob Boras now the tight ends coach of the Buffalo Bills, the Rams need to make a hire to replace him. Trestman was the Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator last season. He was also the Chicago Bears head coach from 2013 until 2014. With Greg Olson already pinged for QB coach, the #Rams are setting their sights on Aaron Kromer, Marc Trestman for OC, per sources. \n— TurfShowTimes (@TurfShowTimes) January 22, 2017 \nTrestman was awarded Coach of the Year in the Canadian Football League in 2009. \nHe has worked as an offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the Oakland Raiders, Arizona Cardinals, San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns. \nOther stops along the way include gigs as quarterbacks coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Minnesota Vikings and the Detroit Lions. He was also the running backs coach for the Vikings and assistant head coach of the Miami Dolphins. Related: Wes Phillips makes the most sense as next Rams offensive coordinator \nHe coached Jake Plummer with the Cardinals from 1998 until 2000. In 1998, Plummer (a second-year quarterback) was sacked more than any other player in the NFL. The following season, Plummer led the league in interceptions. \nThis doesn’t speak well for how Trestman would lead Goff in his second NFL season. Neither does his lack of success with the Chicago Bears as the head coach in 2013 and 2014. Related: \nTrestman was more successful, however, with a veteran: Rich Gannon. The Raiders quarterback led the league in yards per game and total completions in 2002 when Trestman was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. \nWith the 49ers in 1995, Trestman also coached Steve Young for one season. \nJohn McVay, who is the grandfather of Rams new head coach Sean McVay, was one of the executive administrators for San Francisco that season.
