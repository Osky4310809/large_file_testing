Here's what Dushyant Singh Jhala had to say about his very new start-up. 1. How old are you guys? \nBoth my partner Bhawani Singh Chandel and I are 27. We’ve always wanted to do something together, but had different career paths in different cities until 2014. \nAn interesting event changed our course for the better – we tried inquiring about biking tours for a couple and decided that this is something we could invest our time and energy in full time. In October 2015, we quit our jobs, started Let’s Trip in Udaipur and since then there’s been no looking back. 2. How did you get the funding for the company? \nAs soon as we set our minds to doing something on the lines of biking tours, we started researching and studying adventure tourism in detail. We noticed how all the big travel companies have short, crisp names and with a lot of deliberation, settled for ‘Let’s Trip.’ \nA small start-up like ours didn’t need any funding. We started tours with borrowed bicycles and with whatever we earned, we bought bicycles and travelling gear. In just a year, we managed to buy 40 bicycles ranging from Rs. 25,000-40,000. \nNow we have investors approaching us, but we don’t want to go in that direction; we don't want to lose control and we’re enjoying the pace at which we’re going and the kind of work we’re doing. 3. Why did you choose such an unconventional entrepreneurial venture? \nBhawani has been a national level swimmer, and I was a national level hockey player, so we’ve always had a sporty side and our love for cycling has been organic. \nSetting up the company came naturally to us because we got to combine our passion for sports with our love for travel. We go an extra mile to take our travellers to unknown locations and unconventional places because we enjoy discovering places ourselves and have people experience something completely unique. 4. What does Let's Trip currently offer in cycling tours and what's the price range? \nThe costs vary from tour to tour and city to city. We have two kinds of tours: \nDay tours in Udaipur, Jaipur, Pushkar and Panchgani (Maharashtra), which spans over 2- 3 hours and is very good for travellers who want a fixed itinerary. For eg: the 'Sunrise Tour' in Udaipur, which includes pick up and drop to the hotel, packed breakfast, a back-up vehicle following the tour, and it costs Rs. 2,000 per person. \nCustom cycling tours vary from 2 to 10 days covering as many cities of your choice. The tour includes accommodation at jungle lodges, camps, palaces and forts. And is probably one of the best ways to experience Rajasthan. 5. Are there any plans of expanding the cycling tours out of Rajasthan? \nWe want to start cycle tours all over India, and we have already branched out to Panchgani in Maharashtra. We truly want the cycling culture to rise in India and adventure play a key role in tourism in the country. It’ll take time, but we’ll make it happen. 6. How do you go about choosing the cycling tracks? \nChoosing a cycling track is very simple, we start by unlearning whatever we have learned about the place. \nThe idea is to surprise our travellers, and show them something more than the major tourist attractions of that city. For eg: we went to Panchgani, did sightseeing for 2 days, and noticed that though it is a very popular place for strawberry farming, people don't see the farms, they just buy strawberries from the thousands of vendors on the streets and come back. \nSo we came up with a route, which we call the ‘Strawberry Trail’, which goes through some villages into the strawberry farms where you can learn about farming, pluck your own strawberries and buy from the farmer himself. This is an experience unheard of in Panchgani. 7. Are Indians open to adventure trips like this? \nRiding a bicycle is a joy in its own; people get to see beautiful sights and experience the real beat of India on a bicycle. The whole idea of going to a place they did not know about is fun for them. \nWhen we started out, we did not expect many Indians to join us, but surprisingly 40% of our travellers are Indians. At Lets Trip, we are the first to use the concept of a back-up vehicle, so it gives a sense of security and safety to the guests, and makes them open to trying more tours. 8. Is this a year-round thing or specific to one particular season? \nWe’re functional the entire year, but the main season time in Rajasthan is from September to April, so we’ve moved to places like Panchgani where the main season is from May – July. So it really depends on the place that one can visit in a particular season. We’re thinking of branching out to North East very soon. 9. Tell us about the collaboration with Cyclin' Jaipur. \nWe are always looking to collaborate with fellow travelling companies. With our beautiful terrain and vast unexplored areas, India has a huge scope for cycling and luckily Cyclin' Jaipur is one such company, which has a similar working process. They are doing some great work to showcase the heritage of Jaipur and what we do is completely different from them (more adventure trips); so there wasn't any conflict of interest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T08:24:32.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
