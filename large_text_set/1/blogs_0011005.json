Such a person can receive impressions from an object by holding it in his/her hands or, perhaps, touching it to the forehead. Such impressions can be perceived as images, sounds, smells, tastes - even emotions. \nPsychometry is a form of scrying - a psychic way of \"seeing\" something that is not ordinarily seeable. Some people can scry using a crystal ball, black glass or even the surface of water. With psychometry, this extraordinary vision is available through touch. \nFor example, a person who has psychometric abilities - a psychometrist - can hold an antique glove and be able to tell something about the history of that glove, about the person who owned it, about the experiences that person had while in the possession of that glove. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages The psychic may be able to sense what the person was like, what they did and even how they died. Perhaps most important, the psychic can sense how the person felt - the emotions of the person at a particular time. Emotions especially, it seems, are most strongly \"recorded\" in the object. \nThe psychic may not be able to do this with all objects at all times and, as with all psychic abilities, accuracy can vary, but the ability is available to the psychic. \nA BRIEF HISTORY \n\"Psychometry\" as a term was coined by Joseph R. Buchanan in 1842 (from the Greek words psyche , meaning \"soul,\" and metron , meaning \"measure.\") Buchanan, an American professor of physiology, was one of the first people to experiment with psychometry. Using his students as subjects, he placed various drugs in glass vials, and then asked the students to identify the drugs merely by holding the vials. Their success rate was more than chance, and he published the results in his book, Journal of Man . To explain the phenomenon, Buchanan theorized that all objects have \"souls\" that retain a memory. \nIntrigued and inspired by Buchanan's work, American professor of geology William F. Denton conducted experiments to see if psychometry would work with his geological specimens. In 1854, he enlisted the help of his sister, Ann Denton Cridge. The professor wrapped his specimens in cloth so Ann could not see even what type they were. She then placed the wrapped package to her forehead and was able to accurately describe the specimens through vivid mental images she was receiving. \nFrom 1919 to 1922, Gustav Pagenstecher, a German doctor and psychical researcher, discovered psychometric abilities in one of his patients, Maria Reyes de Zierold. While holding an object, Maria could place herself in a trance and be able to state facts about the object's past and present, describing sights, sounds, smells and other feelings about the object's \"experience\" in the world. Pagenstecher's theory was that a psychometrist could tune in to the experiential \"vibrations\" condensed in the object.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T09:49:02.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
