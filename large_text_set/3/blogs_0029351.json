Armed police have now sealed the area and are surveilling the city.   \nWhether the attack is terror related is currently unknown, although local police have claimed it was gang related. “The attack was in place Jacques Febvrier, next to the Porte d’Arras metro station. Officers remain at the scene,” a police spokesperson said. “Those hurt have been taken to the Saint-Vincent-de-Paul hospital. None of the injuries are life threatening.” “A car pulled up outside the station and targeted the three youths hurt. It appears this was a settling of scores,” he continued. #Lille 3 blessés légers ce soir vers 21h45 dans une fusillade porte d’Arras.
