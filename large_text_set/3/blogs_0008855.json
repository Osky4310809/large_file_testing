The 36-year-old star has been slaying it in This Is Us , and has also been totally advocating for body positivity in Hollywood (something, I think, we can all get behind). In fact, the actor has set the record straight about rumors regarding her own weight , and has expertly explained why body shaming of any kind is just totally ridiculous .\nAnd now Chrissy Metz has spoken up about how she feels about appearing on celebrity “worst dressed” lists, and we could all take a leaf out her book, tbh. We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming... @harpersbazaarus \nA post shared by Chrissy Metz (@chrissymetz) on Mar 13, 2017 at 10:31am PDT \nChrissy appeared in a brand new Harpers Bazaar photoshoot , where she also gave an interview in which show spoke about her insecurities, how she used to be like her character Kate in This Is Us , and finding confidence.\nYet there was one part of Chrissy’s interview that we found super inspiring. While talking about what it was like being asked by Harpers to do a sexy photoshoot, the star spoke about how it was “validation.” \n“I can get into this now,” she said to Harpers Bazaar , “ because I finally have the confidence.” \nChrissy then continued, discussing how she’s developed her self-worth, and how she’d react if she appeared on “worst dressed” list.\n“ Like, if I ever end up on the worst-dressed list, it’s not going to make me fall apart, ” she said. “ I want to look great and feel good and be comfortable, but at the same time, none of this really matters . “ This is the fun stuff. “ As so many women have paved the way before me, I am simply paying it forward...with the beautiful help of @harpersbazaarus, thank you for the feature and fun! We spend our lives comparing and despairing and possibly never receiving our deserved true happiness. Why is that? Why don't we uplift instead of repress? Why can't we encourage instead of deter? Here's what I know... It doesn't matter where you come from, what your scale currently says or what society has taught you to believe. You are entitled to greatness. No matter what. I say this to you and as a reminder to myself. All of our roads are paved differently. How amazing that we get to share our bumps and detours with one another. We teach the lessons and often times we are the lesson. We learn from them because we are also the students. We are beautiful works in progress and that's more than enough. Start there. When you sit in your seat confidently you allow others to embrace theirs. ❤️️ Click the link in bio for the full article & details on the amazing artists who helped to create & capture this look. \nA post shared by Chrissy Metz (@chrissymetz) on Mar 13, 2017 at 9:44am PDT \nWe absolutely love Chrissy Metz’s positivity, and her outlook on life.
