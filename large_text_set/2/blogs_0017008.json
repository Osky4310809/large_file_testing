Both teams are in the hunt to reach their second quarter-finals. \nThis is the first leg of the two-leg series. They’ll meet again in Monaco on March 15.Monaco got this far after finishing first in Group E, while Manchester City comes in from the second spot in Group C behind FC Barcelona Leonardo Jardim, Monaco Manager \n. \nPep Guardiola believes Monaco’s free-flowing attacking style is the key ingredient in Radamel Falcao’s late career resurgence ahead of his Manchester City side tackling the Ligue 1 leaders in the Champions League. \nLeonardo Jardim’s side will head to the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday having topped a group featuring Bayer Leverkusen and Tottenham, and buoyed by an astonishing 76 goals in 26 top-flight matches domestically. \n“At Atletico Madrid he did an amazing job before his injuries. Always you need time for the tough injuries he had,” Guardiola said at a news conference to preview the last-16 clash. \n“The system, the way Monaco play now is perfect for him. They attack inside and cross a lot. \n“Players like him need that. He is a good professional, a nice guy and I am happy he is back at his level scoring goals.” \nCity have kept four clean sheets in their past five matches but Guardiola knows Falcao and his partners-in-crime Thomas Lemar, Bernardo Silva, Valere Germain and teenage protege Kylian Mbappe are likely to throw the defensive vulnerabilities that have plagued his side this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:37:00.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
