Clinton has kept a low public profile since her defeat against Donald Trump.\nClinton has familial ties to Scranton, and her appearance there did not seem to indicate any kind of campaign was imminent. Her roughly 20-minute speech, delivered in the ballroom of a Hilton hotel, was mostly concerned with her connections to the local area and stories of her father and grandfather's blue-collar roots. But towards the end of her remarks, she briefly spoke about current events.\n\"I’m like a lot of my friends right now. I have a hard time watching the news, I’ll confess,\" she said.\n\"I am ready to come out of the woods and to help shine a light on what is already happening around kitchen tables, at dinners like this.\"\nClinton spoke in front of about 700 people at an event hosted by the Society of Irish Women. The Society of Irish Women also hosted Barack Obama during his first presidential campaign in 2008, and a spokeswoman remarked that Clinton's crowd was much larger. The group had sought Clinton for a speaking engagement for years.\n\"Women were sitting here and watching their husbands go in their tuxedos to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day,\" she said. \"They decided to start their own group. But men are allowed at our dinner.\"\nThe county where Scranton is located voted narrowly in favor of Clinton in 2016, as she outpaced Trump 49.8 percent to 46.3 percent.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:44:10.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
