It could be that his boring demeanor makes one all droopy-eyed and ready to hit the hay, or because them winning another Super Bowl is pretty much a foregone conclusion at this point (but I hope the Steelers can pull it off now that the Raiders are out).\nNow although it's kind of random, it wasn't really an issue for Brady to be the spokesperson for sleepwear. What is really weird and ultimately cringe-inducing is how Brady tried marketing the pajamas.\n\nHe attempted his best impersonation/call-out of The Rock and the whole thing fell flat. Just horribly flat. \nSo flat that it left people wondering why the hell they bothered uploading it in the first place.\n\nOnce word got to the Rock's ears, he had to issue a response. And the Great One was befuddled by Brady's weird marketing, to say the least. \nThe rock likened Brady to \"Kermit the Frog\" and also roasted the crappy production quality of the video, asking if a \"Jets fan\" directed it. \nBut ultimately The Rock was classy and congratulated Brady on his sleepwear endorsement and simultaneously promoted his upcoming Baywatch movie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:18:18.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
