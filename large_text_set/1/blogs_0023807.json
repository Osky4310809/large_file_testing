The organization behind the protest, Greenpeace, wanted to contribute to the continuation of protests against Trump and his administration that began following his win and basically haven’t ended ever sense . Their resist banner held NOTHING back, and we can only imagine how brave these folks and to be to make this happen.\nTo make their message clear, Greenpeace activists hung the bright yellow resist banner from a 270-foot crane at a construction site just blocks from the White House. Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Just, like, WOW. Look at this. We’ve literally never seen anything quite like this before, and the visual it creates is truly stunning. Now that’s one way to make a statement, and to ensure that millions of people around the world pause and take note! SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images Greenpeace tweeted the following early in the afternoon, showing the world exactly who was behind the message. THANKS @PearlRanFast , @nancypili , @KarenTopakian & the rest of the brave activists for making this act of resistance happen! ✊ #ResistOften pic.twitter.com/oWdi0x1yFC \n— Greenpeace USA (@greenpeaceusa) January 25, 2017 Greenpeace shared a message of thanks with the brave protesters who literally went to dangerous heights in the name of change. “THANKS @PearlRanFast,@nancypili,@KarenTopakian & the rest of the brave activists for making this act of resistance happen! ✊ #ResistOften” One protester, Pearl Robinson, told The Guardian from 300 FEET IN THE AIR, “I can see the White House, where we now have a president who doesn’t have the interests of the majority of the people.” Brave AF. The activists are filled with zero regret about the resist banner, and we’re about it. Several of the #resist climbers just stopped by our DC office (w/slightly smaller banner), still going strong! Reply or share to thank them! pic.twitter.com/s5xKW9bec8 \n— Greenpeace USA (@greenpeaceusa) January 27, 2017 We’re feeling more inspired than ever to refuse to be disillusioned by politics, and instead to stay involved and make our own voices heard. Whether that requires going 300 feet in the air or not is TBD.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T02:55:28.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
