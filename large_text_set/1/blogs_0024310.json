While at that time the debate over \"big fancy weddings\" was nowhere in the picture - you did as much as you could afford - today, when I look back, there is not even a single thing I would have changed. Well, maybe I wouldn't have invited three guests but that's about it). I loved the fanfare, I loved the back-to-back wedding functions, the house full of relatives, friends and lots and lots of food (it was Muslim wedding after all). \nIt was great and today when we sit down to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a big fancy wedding, I always find myself leaning towards the former. If you can afford it (and only \"IF\" you can), then go ahead and have the wedding of your dreams. Because why not? This is your big day - easily one of the most important days of your life, and having it exactly the way you want it, is of utmost importance. Why shouldn't you spend a bomb on flowers, buy a wedding dress that is out of a fancy magazine and have a food buffet that puts MasterChef to shame? \nDon't misunderstand me, I love simple weddings too but the point is, if someone wants a fancy deal, and if they can afford it, why are other people so concerned? Stop with the guilt trip already! \nWeddings, however big or small, are beautiful. Let the bride and groom have it their way! Having a fancy wedding is totally your prerogative and if you have the means to have one, please have it. It's your big day, and no one should be allowed to make you feel guilty about enjoying your day and doing things exactly the way you want to. \nWedding definitely don't \"need\" to be expensive however if you chose to spend money on things like flowers and dresses, it doesn't make you a shallow or bad person. I am not advocating insane expenditure, and wedding loans, just the fact that if you have a choice to pick a fancy wedding, go for it. It's your money, your big day and if you can, why not do it in style?
