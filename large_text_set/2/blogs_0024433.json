We showed this uber cute photo of Taimur that Saif had as his Whatsapp DP and man, does he look just like Kareena! While the world has lots of things to say about his name , Kareena has given her son this unique nickname. \nAccording to a report in TOI, Bebo calls her son “Little John”. We’re not quite sure why but her friends too have reportedly started calling this adorable boy by the same name! Lol. Trust Bebo to come up with something as unique as “Little John” for her son. 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:37:17.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
