Khudobin cleared waivers, and the Bruins assigned him to Providence. \nMcIntyre is having a sensational season in Providence, as he’s been able to post a flawless 10-0-0 record. He leads the AHL both in goals against average (1.41) and save percentage (.951), and he won AHL Goalie of the Month honors for December. \nThis is McIntyre’s second stint with the big club this season, and he’s looking for a little more success this time around. He’s 0-2-0 in two starts with a 4.04 GAA and .859 save percentage. \nKhudobin has struggled all season. He’s allowed three or more goals in five of his seven starts with Boston this season. \nThumbnail photo via Adam Hunger/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T09:33:24.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
