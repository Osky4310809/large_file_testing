It seems like French Montana was waiting for the opportune moment to drop the track and the accompanying visuals above – and that time is now.\nTaking into account all the hype Migos have amassed at the minute, he’s acted swiftly to drop the ‘official video’ for the previously unreleased track, shot during Chris Brown’s “One Hell Of A Nite” Tour back in 2015. The visuals find the artists flossing backstage and on tour buses trading bars whilst out and about.\nMigos, of course, are in the midst of unparalleled success. They recently bought their international phenomenon “Bad and Boujee” to Ellen for a surreal performance, which you can watch below.\n\nCalvin Harris has also officially unveiled that Migos will be featuring on his upcoming track “Shine” alongside Frank Ocean, which you can check out a snippet of here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:39:46.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
