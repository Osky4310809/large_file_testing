Coming up against players like that, they are unforgiving.\" \nWhy you must embrace Pep's Man City \nBut Falcao is not giving up on a place in the quarter-finals ahead of next month's second leg. \nHe said: \"It is still open for the return leg – nothing is finished. We believe we can do better at home and win.\" Le bijou de @FALCAO sur la pelouse de l'Etihad Stadium !!! #CITYASM pic.twitter.com/tQUgdmVHYa — AS MONACO (@AS_Monaco) February 22, 2017 \nFalcao, 31, now has 24 goals from 29 matches across all competitions this season.
