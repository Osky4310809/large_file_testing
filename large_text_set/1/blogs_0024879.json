Sone Aluko of Fulham celebrates during the 4-1 win over Hull \n\"He has showed the right personality, he is only 16 years old but he is 100 per cent going to be in the highest level soon but I am enjoying working with him. \n\"I want to use him in my squad for a long time, he will shine in the future.\" \nThe Fulham manager added: \"Our general performance was very good. Jokanovic said teenager Sessegnon proved he has the quality to go a long way in the game \n\"We have tried to move the ball around against a strong Hull who showed in midweek how good they can be, and what they have changed.\" \nAlthough Hull tested Manchester United almost to the limit on Thursday in their EFL Cup semi-final second leg, Fulham were comfortable winners against the Tigers. \n\"We deserved this victory,\" Jokanovic added. \"We have to be satisfied when we beat a Premier League side. \n\"Look where we are, we are in the next round and we are fighting (for a play-off place), we are fighting hard which is important.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T19:22:14.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
