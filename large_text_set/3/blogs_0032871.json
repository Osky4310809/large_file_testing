The conviction followed former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley and former senior VP Gary Schultz pleading guilty to similar charges.\nAdvertisement \n\nWith Joe Paterno dead, Sandusky in jail for the rest of his life, and three high-level former Penn State officials found to have committed crimes, now is probably a good time for Penn State the institution to do what it should’ve done years ago: Shut up, accept responsibility for having prioritized successful football over the welfare of children, and pledge to do better in the future. \nAlas, doing so would go against everything we know about scandal-plagued athletics departments and academic institutions. \nAdvertisement \n\n“Running out of sympathy for 35 yr old, so-called victims with 7 digit net worth,” Penn State trustee Albert Lord wrote in an email to the Chronicle of Higher Education . “Do not understand why they were so prominent in trial. As you learned, Graham Spanier never knew Sandusky abused anyone.”\n\nLord doesn’t specify who these “so-called” victims are, but in this instance it’s likely that he’s referring to McQueary, who is 33, and won $12.27 million in damages from Penn State for wrongful termination, defamation, and improperly handling a whistleblower. After witnessing Sandusky abusing a child, McQueary first told his father, then Joe Paterno, Curley, and Schultz, who reported it to Spanier. McQueary testified at Spanier’s trial, and is an object of derision for Penn State truthers.\n“I am tired of victims’ getting in the way of clearer thinking and a reasoned approach to who knew what and who did what,” Lord told the Chronicle in a follow-up interview. “The notion that there can be only one point of view with respect to all this stuff, and trustees at Penn State should toe a line that reflects the politically correct point of view, is symptomatic of what ails us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:19:05.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
