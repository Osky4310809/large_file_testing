Stine Brings Horror And Humor To Marvel's Man-Thing Jamie Lovett Start Slideshow Slide of \nFor more than 25 years, author R.L Stine has unnerved readers with his Goosebumps and Fear Street horror book series. Now Stine is bringing his horror skills to the Marvel Universe. Stine is penning a five-issue Man-Thing series in collaboration with artist German Peralta. \nThe first issue of Man-Thing hits stands today and it sees the shambling swamp creature visiting someplace that even he had previously feared to tread: Hollywood. ComicBook.com spoke to Stine about what he has in store for Marvel's Man-Thing. \nWhat kinds of themes are you exploring in your Man-Thing series? \nRL Stine: I don't think about themes. I'm a plot guy. Just a story guy. All my books are just totally plot driven. The main theme as it develops is there's going to be chaos on Earth unless Man-Thing can rescue Old Father. Old Father controls the swamp and he controls all order and he's been kidnapped and dragged into the nexus of all realities. The Man-Thing, of course, he thinks, “Why me? Why do I have to be the one to go get him?” \nBut he has to go into the nexus which is horribly dangerous and a new reality every minute and try to find Old Father and bring him back or else there will be chaos in the world. That's the theme. \nIs that a story you were already thinking about when you started on Man-Thing or was it built around the character? \nRL Stine: The second. I should say, “Oh, yes, I had a grand plan,” but to be totally honest, I kind of did it one book at a time. I would get to this part of the story and then figure out what's the next part of the story. But once we had the nexus idea, and once we had Old Father about to be executed by an evil queen, then I had it. That was it. But when I first started out I didn't know what I was doing. I was so pleased with the opening scene in the movie studio where he's a total flop and they insult him and he has to leave. He scared the kids. He tested badly and he doesn't even get a ride back to the swamp. I kind of started with that. I thought that would be a funny way to start out. \nWas that seen at all a reaction to or inspired by your own experiences in Hollywood? \nRL Stine: Well, I've never really been told not to sit on the couch or anything like that, but yeah, we've done a lot of movies and TV stuff so it was kind of fun to write about it. \nWith this being your first comics work, how has the experience been working with artist German Peralta? \nRL Stine: I did a humor magazine for 10 years called Bananas . It was a humor magazine for kids. It was a lot like MAD , but except it was all in color. MAD was in black and white in those days. I did it for 10 years and I worked with a lot of cartoonists and a lot of artists. One of them is like art director of MAD right now, one of the guys I discovered. So I have worked with artists a lot, but this is the first comic book I've ever written. \nDid you find bringing the horror atmosphere of your work to the visual medium of comics anymore or less challenging than in prose? \nRL Stine: Well, you know, when you write, when I write a Goosebumps book, I try to visualize the theme. This was pretty much the same except that I didn't really have to write the description. When you describe a room or a creepy basement or something in Goosebumps, you visualize it. Writing for the comic was really the same thing. Then it was kind of interesting to how the illustrator saw it, how different his view of it was.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T18:55:27.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
