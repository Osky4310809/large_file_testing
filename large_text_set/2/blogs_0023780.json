Call me old-fashioned, but that’s really not my style. I’d rather attempt to woo with the rest of me, then send a picture of an out-of-context meat log and say “Hey…wanna smash?” But hey.. different strokes for different folks. \nNow, we’ve had some other reactions to dick pics on the site before, usually from girls trolling oblivious dudes. There’s also been the occasional dude that’s shown up too with a hilarious response or two to a wrong number dicking. \nThis guy here, Imgur user Syntax1985 , I think he takes the cake, handling an unwanted dick pic with just the right prescription of trolling. 2 \nAccording to his post, he’s gotten a few unwanted dick pics before and he always pretends to be a doctor, but usually the person on the other end tells him to fuck off and that’s the end of it. \nBut not this guy.
