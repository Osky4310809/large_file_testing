Courtesy Omaze Stay on target Captain America: Civil War is peak Marvel Cinematic Universe First look at Captain America: Civil War’s actual villain Would you escape with Chris Evans on a train? Would you escape with Chris Evans on a plane?\nI’d escape with Chris Evans anywhere, especially if he’s pranking comic book store customers.\nThe Captain America actor is raising money for his escape-the-room charity event and in order to promote it, released a video on Thursday that shows him messing with the heads of people at a comic store near Boston.\nEvans teamed up with the store, called Comicazi, to set up a mini escape room for unsuspecting customers. In the video, we see him luring people in with a Captain America doll that he’s talking through with a walkie-talkie. The actor then led people through a series of clues that would eventually lead them to a hidden door and into the basement to meet him.\nSome of the activities included looking for a code (which was actually posted in giant lettering on the wall) and going around the street outside the shop looking for an undercover Hydra operative.\nThis is worth watching for a couple of reasons. One, because Evans is a real-life Captain America and his charity, Christopher’s Haven, has been doing great things for children and their families who are getting cancer treatment in Boston. Two, because this used to be my neighborhood comic book store AND I’M SO MAD I WASN’T THERE.\nThe video is promoting a fundraising effort and contest that’ll benefit Christopher’s Haven. Users donate to the Omaze campaign to gain entries. The winner and three friends will get the chance to join Evans for beer, burgers, and an escape-the-room adventure. People have until Feb. 3 to enter.\nChristopher’s Haven is a home for kids and their families that are visiting Mass. General Hospital for cancer treatments. It provides temporary apartments and a recreation area, giving those families a place to stay and an area to escape to instead of a hospital.\nThrough Christopher’s Haven, Evans has also visited children staying in local hospitals, and he’s brought some friends along. Following a well-publicized bet , Chris Pratt dressed up as Starlord and visited Christopher’s Haven. In return, Evans dressed up as Captain America and visited a Seattle-area hospital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T16:09:40.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
