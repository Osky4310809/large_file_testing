Just over two months later, it appears all the IUD cheerleading really did make a serious impact. In an appearance on CNN on Monday, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said her organization saw a 900 percent increase in demand for IUDs in the days following the election, and she believes the increase is the direct result of fears concerning a President Trump.   \"We've had a 900 percent increase in women trying to get into Planned Parenthood to get an IUD because they are desperately concerned that they might lose their access to health care, and they know that Planned Parenthood is the place that can provide it,\" Richards told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. . @CecileRichards : “Women in this country are absolutely not going without a fight.” https://t.co/HsXwhkUn25 \n— Christiane Amanpour (@camanpour) January 9, 2017 Most Popular Richards emphasized that the Republican lawmakers' promises to defund Planned Parenthood would drastically affect women's ability to access healthcare in the United States. With Amanpour's urging, Richards clarified that Planned Parenthood does not provide abortions using federal funds, because the federal government does not provide funding for abortion services. \"What we're talking about now, in fact, and what Paul Ryan, Speaker Ryan, said the other day, is now they will end access to Planned Parenthood preventive care,\" Richards said. As Richards mentioned on CNN, Planned Parenthood is the biggest provider of women's healthcare in the country. She said that GOP lawmakers' war on Planned Parenthood would put 55 million women at risk of losing free birth control that the organization provides. \"It's really a problem when politicians put their politics ahead of women's healthcare in America,\" Richards said. \"This is not even what voters voted for.\" Related Story Cecile Richards: What I've Learned Richards also mentioned she's excited and proud to join the Women's March on Washington the day after the inauguration. \"What's important is that women and men were concerned about the future of women's rights and women's health in the U.S., that they make their voices heard in whatever way,\" Richards said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T08:30:44.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
