The streets of Westminster are ingrained with the spirit of freedom.\" \n\"Tomorrow morning Parliament will meet as normal. We will come together as normal. And Londoners and others around the world will get up and go about their day as normal. They will board their trains. They will leave their hotels. They will walk these streets. They will live their lives, they will all move forward together, never giving into terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart.\" \nShe also thanked the service people who attended to those on the scenes of the attacks. \n\"Once again today these exceptional men and women ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way. They have lost one of their own in today's attack only makes their calmness and professionalism under pressure all the more remarkable,\" May said. \nYou can watch her full speech on video here: Watch in full: PM @theresa_may pays tribute to the \"exceptional men and women\" of the emergency services after terror attack at #Westminster pic.twitter.com/d4dIAcf9K6 — Sky News (@SkyNews) March 22, 2017 \nHer speech comes after her chairing a Cabinet Office Briefing Room meeting. COBR meetings are the locations for a type of crisis response committee set up to co-ordinate the actions of bodies within the Government. \nAround 2.40 p.m. GMT (10.40 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, March 22, a car drove into dozens of people on crowded Westminster Bridge while a police officer was stabbed in the grounds of parliament around the same time. The officer has since died from the stabbing. \nBoth incidents occurred on the anniversary of the Brussels airport terror attack. \nIn a statement given at around 4.45 p.m. GMT (12.45 p.m. ET), a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police confirmed that a counterterrorism investigation is ongoing and that additional officers will patrol the capital tonight and Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:03:33.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
