HTC takes the covers off its all-glass U Ultra and U Play smartphones By - January 12, 2017 “The HTC U Ultra is the company’s first smartphone to feature a secondary ticker display” \nHTC didn’t make any smartphone announcements at the recently concluded CES, but less than a week later, the company has unveiled its new U series of smartphones. The brand has unveiled the HTC U Ultra and U Play at a dedicated event. The HTC U Ultra is the Taiwanese manufacturer’s first smartphone to flaunt an always-on secondary ticker display above the main screen. It features an aluminium frame and glass on both the front and back. The brand said this design will be a key feature of the upcoming HTC devices. \nThe new HTC U series phones are packed with HTC’s Sense Companion, which is powered by artificial intelligence to learn a user’s daily activity and adapt accordingly. They come with four low-power always-on microphones that respond to voice commands. They also feature biometric voice unlock and control features. They feature U-Sonic, a sonar-based technology, which delivers sound tuned for user’s listening preference. Both phones skip the 3.5mm audio jack in favour of USB Type-C audio. \nThe HTC U Ultra is a phablet-grade offering featuring a huge 5.7-inch QHD display with Sapphire or Gorilla Glass 5 on top. The 2-inch secondary ticker display on top of the main screen gives you access to frequently-used apps, reminders for upcoming events, and more. It also displays prioritised notifications discreetly. \nAs for the other specs, the U Ultra is powered by a 2.15GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, mated to 4GB of RAM. It comes in 64GB (Gorilla Glass 5 protection) and 128GB storage (Sapphire glass protection) variants, further expandable via a microSD card. The phone sports a 12MP UltraPixel 2 rear camera with OIS, PDAF, laser autofocus, dual-tone LED flash, and 4K recording. For selfies, it gets a 16MP camera with an UltraPixel mode, a BSI sensor, Panorama selfie, and full HD recording. The other features include a fingerprint sensor, Android Nougat, a 3,000mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 tech, a USB Type-C port, Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi, NFC, and GPS. \nComing to the HTC U Play, it features a 5.2-inch Super LCD full HD display with a Gorilla Glass on top. It is fuelled by a MediaTek Helio P10 processor. It comes in different RAM and storage configurations – 3GB / 4GB and 32GB / 64GB. The device features a 16MP rear snapper with OIS, PDAF, a BSI sensor, a dual-tone LED flash, and full HD recording. The selfie shooter on board is a 16MP sensor with an UltraPixel mode and 1080p recording. The other specs include a fingerprint sensor, Android Marshmallow, a 2,500mAh battery, NFC, and a USB Type-C port. \nThe HTC U Ultra will be up for pre-order in the US today at a starting price of $749, roughly Rs 50,900. The U Play will be available in limited markets, and pricing for this hasn’t been announced yet. The smartphones will be available in four different hues – Brilliant Black, Cosmetic Pink, Ice White, and Sapphire Blue.
