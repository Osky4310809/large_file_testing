What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?\" \nMr Trump pointed to Ms Kuenssberg and turned to Mrs May, saying: \"This was your choice of a question?\" May and Trump take questions from the press Credit: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images \nH e then leaned in to the microphone and joked: \"There goes that relationship.\" \nHis response prompted laughter in the room - but some viewers criticised the BBC journalist's questioning as \"rude\": @BBCWorld @BBCNews I thought the BBC question was rude & I felt embarrassed — wendy hayward (@xxmisswendyxx) 27 January 2017 @BBCDanielS The BBC question was an embarrassment and extremely rude.
