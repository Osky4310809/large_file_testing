(Photo: Getty Images) More Everyone wants to be more like Beyoncé . The key is not being so obvious about it. Either Ciara doesn’t care to hide her admiration, or she really does share Queen Bey’s style — to a T. You might recall seeing Beyoncé live for the first time after she announced her second pregnancy . It was on the red carpet for the Grammys a few weeks ago, and she wore a memorable red gown . The glittering ruby Peter Dundas creation had long sleeves and hugged her curves, yet flowed in the long skirt. It featured a plunging V-neckline. The tight bodice framed her bump perfectly, and the singer cradled her belly for the photographers. Her honey-highlighted hair was straight and flat. The stunning look was a memorable one — especially for Ciara, apparently. The also-pregnant R&B singer walked the red carpet on Sunday for the Vanity Fair Oscars party in a looked that echoed Beyoncé’s Grammy ensemble. And everyone noticed. The cut of Ciara’s Jovani gown was nearly the same as Beyoncé’s — ruby hue, floor-length, long sleeves, hugging her hourglass figure and pregnant belly, and trailing behind her. Even the neckline was almost identical. The only difference in the dress was the material — Ciara’s was velvet. In case that was too much of a departure from Beyoncé’s look, Ciara’s hair could have been right off Beyoncé’s head; it was the same color and style, except with a side part. She even posed exactly as Beyoncé did, cradling her bump. Of course, the Internet has gone wild, with memes galore poking fun at the similarities. While there’s no denying they’re twinning, they are both individually stunning women. We think this posts sums it up best: Now excuse us while we sing “Lady in Red” — twice.
