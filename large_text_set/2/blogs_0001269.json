For those who follow fashion and style, you might know that Marios is royalty when it comes to photography and the arts. He is one of the most sought after lensmen in the world! So when we spotted Katrina posing and clicking pictures with him our curiosity knew no bounds! Testino is one of world’s ace fashion photographers who is affiliated with GQ, Vogue, Vanity Fair and more. He has not only done some phenomenal shoots for the magazines internationally but has also shot some of the top notch personalities. From Princess Diana to Scarlett Johansson to Kate Moss to Blake Lively, he has conducted photoshoots with a lot of them and the result has been quite spectacular. \nSo what secret recipe are Katrina and Mario cooking ? A source reveals that Mario has shot a stunning photoshoot with Kat and the pictures have turned out amazing! The photos are going to be as breathtaking as one can imagine. Although the photoshoot has been kept under the wraps, the crew working on it has been gushing about the project to everyone. This would also be the first time Mario has clicked a Bollywood actress. Could it be more exciting? The Vogue party in honour of Testino was held in Delhi on January 31, where many from the publication along with Katrina were present. There were quite a few pics of the Tiger Zinda Hai actress striking a pose with the ace photographer. In fact, makeup genius Val Garland was also present at the event which only means one thing, it’s going to be a bigger project than one anticipated. In case you missed out, we’ve attached pics from #lastnight.
