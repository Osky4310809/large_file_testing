By: AP | Bilbao | Published:January 6, 2017 9:22 am Athletic Bilbao beat Barcelona for only the third time in 32 matches over the last 10 years. (Source: Reuters) \nBarcelona’s two-year reign of the Copa del Rey was in jeopardy after it lost to a nine-man Athletic Bilbao 2-1 at a packed San Mames Stadium on Thursday. \nAthletic played a man down from the 74th minute, and two men down from the 80th because of red cards in a drama-filled first-leg match in the round of 16. \nAritz Aduriz scored and set up another goal in the first half for Athletic, and Lionel Messi scored for Barcelona from a free kick early in the second half. Messi hit the post from inside the area three minutes into stoppage time, and Paco Alcacer missed the open net off the ensuing rebound. \nAthletic beat Barcelona for only the third time in 32 matches over the last 10 years. In that period, Barcelona has beaten Athletic in three Copa del Rey finals, won their last three league matches, and won both legs of their quarterfinal matchup last year. \nBut a draw next week in the second leg at Camp Nou will be enough to send Athletic to the quarterfinals. \nAthletic took control early as Aduriz’s header opened the scoring in the 25th, and Inaki Williams padded the lead after a pass by Aduriz in the 28th. \nMessi pulled Barcelona closer by converting a free kick in the 52nd, with the ball just barely crossing the line after a save attempt by Athletic goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz. \nSecond yellow cards by midfielders Raul Garcia and Ander Iturraspe reduced Athletic, which had to endure a siege by the visitors. \nAthletic’s only loss at San Mames this season was against Barcelona in its first home game in the league. Since then, it has won 10 games and drawn one. \nIn other first-leg matches, Real Madrid defeated Sevilla 3-0 at home on Wednesday, while visiting Atletico Madrid beat Las Palmas 2-0 on Tuesday. \nAll return matches are next week.
