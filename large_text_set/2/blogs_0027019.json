But while both the Federal Government and the various state governments try to come to terms with this reality and proffer solution, it has emerged that the problem cannot be solved without private sector participation and initiatives. \nIt was based on this consideration that the Director, Rite Foods Limited, makers of Bigi beverages and sausages, Mr Saleem Adegunwa, said the company was established. Speaking during a facility tour of the company’s new site on the Sagamu Benin expressway ,Ososa, Ogun State, Adegunwa said all things considered the company was motivated by the desire to empower people in its host communities, especially the youths. \nHe said since production started on the new site, the company has put in place security measures not only in the factory but also in the community to safeguard their means of livelihood. \nThe new factory, he informed, is built on 23.780 hectares of land area (58.763 acres) comprising three main buildings: the Bakery Factory, Beverage Factory and the Warehouse, including other buildings such as Security/Fire Station, Staff Welfare, Service Bakery, Generator House and Gate House. \nHis words: “Even with the amount and quality of equipment on ground, we have had no security challenge as adequate precautions have been taken. Since we came into the town, there has been an influx of people which necessitates a 24-hour surveillance. \nOur coming here has triggered off lots of activities with many people, especially the youths being gainfully employed. This is because our coming here has given this town a new face as people are now putting structures in place which were not there before.” \nSuch that development in this town is physical and this makes workers and other people security conscious.” He added that the company’s employees which have grown from 100 at its inception in 2007 to close to 1000 were provided with accommodation and feeding allowances. “Through employment, people are engaged and so are able to take care of themselves and their families.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:17:54.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
