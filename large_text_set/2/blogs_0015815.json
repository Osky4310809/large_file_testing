I was very happy there, but I was affected by this situation that turned into a genuine nightmare. \n“I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone. I couldn’t leave my house, neither could my family. I thank the courts for ensuring the truth came out.\" Quagliarella is now hoping to move forwards (Photo: Getty) Read More Kostas Mitroglou continues Benfica renaissance with goal of the season contender \nHe later told Samp's in-house channel: \"Believe me it's a massive weight off my shoulders, said Quagliarella after the game. \"Justice has won. I've been through the mill over the past few years. \n\"I couldn't speak up for myself because the investigations were ongoing. I've had to deal with terrible things being said about me. \n\"This is the start of a second life. A happier one.\" Quagliarella during his time with Napoli (Photo: Getty) \nIn anonymous letters sent to Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis, Quagliarella was accused of cocaine use, having sex with underage girls and links to the Camorra Mafia. \nHis stalker, Raffaele Piccolo - a former policeman - had also got in touch with the player, offering to track down the mystery offender in his capacity as an officer of the law. \nPiccolo was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison last Friday, after being found guilty of blackmail and extortion.

I had been falsely accused of being a Camorrist and a paedophile who was participating in orgies.\" \nQuagliarella's strike against Cagliari was his fifth goal in 25 games in Serie A this season for Samp, following his summer switch from Torino.
