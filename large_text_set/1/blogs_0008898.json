But RSL traded Saborio to D.C. United as his goal totals diminished in 2015, and Saborio failed to lock down a regular spot in the capital. \nAfter D.C. declined his contract option, rumors began that he would return to Costa Rica, but the process to sign was \"maybe a little long,\" Saborio said. \nWhen asked at the introductory news conference if he has a goal total in mind over the next two short seasons, Saborio replied, \"No, I never set goals like that, but I do see myself scoring plenty of goals. I can see myself celebrating in the stadium. I have to integrate myself with the team, get in good form and be able to fight for a spot.\" @al_saborio durante su presentación en el @SaprissaOficial — Luis Alvarado (@alvaradofoto) January 10, 2017 \nSaprissa won the Costa Rican title in December but has seen its team hit with an exodus of players — many of whom are headed to MLS. Saborio said he's excited to use the experience he had abroad to help the young players Saprissa will be relying on for success in the upcoming seasons. \n\"I feel really happy to be in a position to have the knowledge I can pass on to the young players to make them better so they can achieve an important career. We're going to contribute everything we can,\" he said. \nLos Morados are set for a CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinal against Pachuca and also started off their title defense with a wobble, losing 1-0 to San Carlos in the opening round of the new short tournament.
