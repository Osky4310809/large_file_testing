But it isn't just that superb run that the Blues' rivals should be concerned about. \n'My focus is City' - Yaya won't speak to clubs about free transfer \nAs they threaten to run away with the Premier League title, Chelsea's winning streak is a short-term worry for everyone in English football. Even if they lose against Spurs on Wednesday, Conte's unprecedented early success is giving him a chance to build something special in west London. \nThis run has left those around Stamford Bridge glowing with pride as Conte appears to have grasped everything that is needed to run a major club in a competitive market in England. The Italian has been impressed by many of his opposite numbers, but his visit to Tottenham in 2015, when he was Italy manager, appears to have been a factor in inspiring him to tackle English football. \nTottenham may have inadvertently brought a true talent to the Premier League, but they have one of their own in Mauricio Pochettino, and Conte believes the Argentine is one of the best managers in the world. He openly admires his rival's style and counts him unlucky to have missed out on the title last year. \nThe Blues should be a team undergoing a transitional season, but they are dominating the Premier League with Conte showing his tactical nous, while using his people skills to get the best out of his players. \nJust like Spurs, Chelsea look like a team with an identity once again as Conte builds on the good feeling around Stamford Bridge. In his first six months Conte has implemented his own distinctive style of football while forging quick bonds with players and board members. \nConte's popularity with those around the club means that he is able to implement his vision, and he is succeeding where Pep Guardiola is, so far, failing by charming all parties around Chelsea with his humble, yet hard-working demeanour. \nHis people skills appear to be sincere and over the Christmas period Conte has done everything from throw a party for his team's wives and children, to offer hand-written gifts to those who work around his training ground. Conte even took an hour out to get a drink with journalists who attend his weekly press conferences. \nThe Blues boss is fully invested in his new club and working to a long-term plan; his family have recently moved from their native Italy to be with their father and husband with Antonio preparing for a long-term stay. Conte's sincerity was displayed as he said he planned a long-term stay, even after back-to-back defeats to Liverpool and Arsenal in October. \n“I hope to work with this club for many years to build something important, for the present and for the future,” said Conte. “It is important in some moments that you have time to work, but what is important now is to work a lot to build something more important. \n“But, when I signed my contract with Chelsea, I signed for three years. In my mind is to stay here for three years and to build some success for this club.” \nConte: Chelsea's schedule only being criticised because we're top \nHis building job hasn't taken as long as many thought it would, with Conte previously being told that David Luiz is too error prone, Pedro isn't good enough, and that Diego Costa wants to leave. He has found solutions to every issue that he has so far faced. \nChelsea's owner, Roman Abramovich, has been often criticised for chopping and changing managers too quickly since taking over in 2003, as he ended seven of his ten managers' careers early at Stamford Bridge. There are signs that Conte might be the man to buck the trend as Abramovich adapts to a new era in Premier League football, where not all of the great teams win the title. \nAbramovich looks like he knows what he has got with Conte and has had meetings with his club's manager at Cobham Training Centre, while he also looks invested in the club on the whole, having travelled to Vienna to watch his team's first game under Conte in pre-season. \nThe goal before the season started was to finish in the top four and, while that is still not guaranteed, it is hard to imagine the Premier League's leading club falling short under the stability of their manager. \nIt is hard to imagine a manager could replicate the legacy left by Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, much less Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, but there are signs that Chelsea will give Conte a bigger chance to build something for the long-term. \nChelsea fans have yearned for a manager who is both a winner and who gives their club a style; Conte looks like he can do that, while there is hope that Chelsea are adapting to help him achieve that. \nArsenal's comeback too little, too late \nThe success of the club goes beyond Conte, of course, with the board implementing an improved showing in the transfer market in the summer. The youth teams dominate in both England and Europe, as well as an army of almost 40 players being on loan from Chelsea at other clubs. \nChelsea will also break all revenue records next season with a return to Champions League being exactly what's needed to attract one or two world-class players in the summer. \nThis is the structure that allows Chelsea to be a success, in spite of their recent manager sackings and not because of it. Conte can bring it all together and introduce young, local players into his first team while winning titles in world football's most competitive competition.
