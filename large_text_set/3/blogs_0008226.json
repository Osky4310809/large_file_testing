The Victorian delusions of the British government will not receive a positive hearing in today’s Africa.” \nFox is meeting representatives of Commonwealth countries on Thursday hoping to promote free-trade deals between the nations and their former colonial ruler. The event is organized by the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council, which in turn is supported by diamond mining companies , among other controversial corporations. \nSkeptical Whitehall officials dubbed the plans ‘Empire 2.0’, pointing to the Cabinet’s lack of tact and respect for Britain’s former colonies. \n“Unfortunately for Liam Fox and his plans for ‘Empire 2.0’, Britain no longer rules the waves, and can’t dictate the terms of trade to poorer countries in quite the way that it once could,” Global Justice Now Director Nick Dearden said. \n“But that doesn’t mean that Fox won’t try to fleece African economies in the interests of putting as much ‘cheap stuff’ as possible on Western supermarket shelves.” \nVia RT .
