I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone gives \n— Ram Gopal Varma (@RGVzoomin) March 8, 2017 \nAlthough a series of clarification tweets and an apology followed, the tweet was still unjustified and uncalled for. An FIR was also lodged against him in Goa, and a Twitter campaign asking people to boycott him was also being run. Turns out, unlike the rest of the country, Sunny Leone was not offended by RGV’s tweet, and her spokesperson reportedly said that she did not find anything wrong in it. RGV is a good friend of Sunny, and she took his post on a lighter note. \nAccording to IndiaForums , Sunny does not wish to make any controversy out of it. The spokesperson further added: \nThat’s not a dig. He is a freind. He is making a joke. In good humor. Not everything is controversial. \nUmm. Well, okay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T12:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T11:57:34.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
