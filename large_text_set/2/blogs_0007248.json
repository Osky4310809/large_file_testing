One of his favorites is 'Pleasantville.' Here's why. \nIn actor/filmmaker/ NoBudge -founder Kentucky Audley 's first-ever video essay, he chooses to tackle the \"Ron Howard\"-helmed Pleasantville , a film about two teenagers from the '90s who go into their favorite '50s sitcom and end up teaching everyone in the soul-crushing, monochrome town many lessons, including the importance of color, as well as, in Audley's words, \"having sex, and reading books.\" \nThere's nothing we can say to describe this video essay that will be more entertaining than watching it, so it's best just to sit back in awe of Audley's trenchant analysis. (Pro tip: It's satire.) \nIn his breakdown of Pleasantville 's excellent cinematography, complex themes, and impressive performances, it's clear—also from his site, and from his work—that Audley loves movies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:13:03.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
