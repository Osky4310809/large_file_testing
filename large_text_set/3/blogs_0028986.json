The researchers performed MRI scans on patients before they received treatment, and discovered that those with connectivity between certain brain regions were more likely to respond to cognitive behavioral therapy, while those with absent connectivity there were more likely to respond to antidepressant medication. \nGrow a Heart—With Spinach Leaves Researchers are hard at work trying to develop tissue and even full organs to transplant into people to treat disease, but figuring out the vascular system—necessary for transporting blood into the tissue—has remained a problem. Now, they may be one step closer. Researchers from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute have now cultured human heart cells on spinach leaves , replicating the way blood can flow through human tissue. These findings may one day may be used to grow layers of healthy heart muscle as a treatment for heart attack patients. \nFight Opioid Addiction Opioid addiction is spiking, and the number of deaths caused by it has been climbing. Now, researchers have discovered a possible new treatment for it: a prescription weight-loss drug called lorcaserin. In their study, they found that lorcaserin reduced the use and cravings for opioids , possibly by tweaking the reward center in the brain. \nTest For Food Allergies Allergic to some kind of tree nut? Well, you may not need to avoid all of them, research in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology suggests. Researchers discovered that among people allergic to one kind of tree nut—almonds, cashews, walnuts and hazelnuts, for example— more than 50 percent successfully passed an oral food challenge to other tree nuts without a reaction. Talk to your doctor about undergoing testing if you want to see what foods you really should avoid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:27:43.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
