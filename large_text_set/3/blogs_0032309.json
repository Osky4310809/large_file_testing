At the same time, he would oblige aides to take dictation standing in the door of his office bathroom while he went about emptying his bowels, as if in some alpha-male ritual assertion of his primacy. Even on the floors of the House and Senate, he would extravagantly rummage away at his groin, sometimes reaching his hand through a pocket and leaning with half-lifted leg for more thorough access.” 7 \n“I recall reading the British dropped pictures of Hitler with his dick out onto Germany during the war. Think it was a cartoon or painted picture.”– apple_kicks \n“Also a toilet roll with Hitler’s face on it.”– Insert_Gnome_Here \n“The full story, and images, is HERE! . (Scroll way down.) One of the most intriguing and insidious insults to Adolf Hitler was a propaganda postcard code numbered H.789 produced by Director Sefton Delmer of the British Political Warfare Executive (PWE) that showed the Führer with his penis in his hand. The postcard chosen to caricature was originally a product of Foto Hoffman of Munich. Hitler stands on what appears to be balcony with his left hand on the rail and his right hand on his waist. In the parody, his right hand is depicted holding a circumcised penis. This probably was designed to feed the rumor that Hitler was indeed a self-hating Jew. The text is a quote from Hitler’s Munich speech of 8 November 1942: \nWhat we have, that we firmly hold.– Communal_prosess 8 \n“Catherine the Great wasn’t the greatest looking woman, or the kindest, nor did she act much like a woman was expected to in her time. But she WAS one of the most powerful women in history, and incredibly intelligent, and she had quite a sexual appetite. So she made sure that all of her lovers were very well compensated, in the form of money, land, and titles, to ensure that she had a steady supply of them. \nCatherine the Great probably spent the most money on sex since the Greeks.”– AcceptablePariahdom 9 \n“James Joyce sent some very NSFW letters to his wife, some of which were filled with scat and fartplay.”– eternalsapphire \nIt’s far too dirty to reproduce here, but it starts off like this, in case you’re curious: \nMy sweet little whorish Nora I did as you told me, you dirty little girl, and pulled myself off twice when I read your letter. I am delighted to see that you do like being fucked arseways. Yes, now I can remember that night when I fucked you for so long backwards. It was the dirtiest fucking I ever gave you, darling. \nThe rest is full of farts, queefs, the term ‘fuckbird’ and some graphic descriptions of his oral skills. Read it for yourself HERE , and step up your sext game. 10 \n“President Grover Cleveland had a bastard child after he date raped a store clerk. When accusations came out, Cleveland’s team launched a massive smear campaign against the mother of his child, basically naming her a liar and harlot.”– lordlollygag \n“It’s even worse than that. To cover things up, they had her committed to an asylum and had her son taken away. Though, fortunately for her, the physician who examined her realized she wasn’t insane and released her. Her attempts to get her son back failed. He was later adopted by the physician from the asylum.”– DisturbedNocturne Advertisement Advertisement 11 \n“European women of the 17th century would bare one or both breasts as a sign of virtue. They often used wet nurses in order to ‘preserve’ their breasts for public display.”– LovesSleep 12 \n“I remember my history teacher talking about a pope that ordered 50 prostitutes to pick up chestnuts off a floor with their vaginas.”– samoangerman \nNOTE: It was called the Banquet of Chestnuts , and it was organized by Cesare Borgia, son of Pope Alexander VI in 1501. The accuracy of the event is disputed, but if it did happen, that’s some pretty fucked up dinner entertainment, right there. 13 \n“Louis XIV had anal fistulas, like really, REALLY, bad ones. He would get four enemas a day and slather it with all sorts of weird balms and ointments. He had to get it operated on, which was crazy considering there hadn’t been a successful operation of that sort in history. The surgery was astonishingly successful and Louis was riding his horse again within a few months. \nEveryone was so happy about it, 1686 was declared the year of the fistula, “L’annee de la Fistule”, and the hot trend in France was to get anal fistula operations, regardless of whether or not you actually had any. Basically it was fashionable in the aristocracy to have a swollen, leaky asshole. \nOne positive to come out of it though, was that surgery was viewed in a better light. The overwhelming success of anal sugeries made people feel as though surgery was safe in any context, and that ended up advancing surgical techniques quite a lot. Surgery was finally viewed as something that required intelligence and knowledge, not just an ability to cut human tissue.”– chibuezephoibos \nIt looks like the artist really captured a guy who’s got a stinky surprise waiting in his drawers, don’t you think? 14 \n“Niccolo Machiavelli, author of the Prince, once got so horny he visited a prostitute, only she was so ugly he threw up all over her. His description of the event is both gross and hilarious: \nWhat the hell, Luigi, you can see what fortune can do to men. You had just finished fucking your woman when you want another one. I’ve been in Modena for several days when I came across an old woman who washes my shirts. She asked me to come into her hovel because she wished to show me some fine shirts. Innocent prick that I am I went in. There was a woman over in the corner. “This is the shirt that I wanted to sell you,” the hag said. I was terrified. But I fucked her. I found her thighs flabby and her cunt damp. Her breath stank. But I was horny. When I was finished I took a torch and looked at her. I nearly dropped dead. The woman was ugly. She had a tuft of hair on her head but her head was bald. Her forehead was scarred. One eye looked up, the other down. Her eyes were filled with mucus, and she had no eyebrows. Her nose was twisted into a funny shape. Her mouth looked like Lorenzo de’ Medici’s but was bent to one side. She was toothless and saliva drooled out of her mouth. Her upper lip had a moustache. I looked at her stupefied. “What’s the matter sir?” she asked me. As soon as she opened her mouth, such a stench came out that my eyes and my nose were assaulted and my stomach indignant. They could not bear it, and I vomited all over her. ”– AnalJihadist 15 \nThanks to Pompeii we have a lot of knowledge of what graffiti and everyday life was like in the Roman Empire. \nFun fact: think of some of the trolliest message boards you can find and that’s basically what roman public boards and building sides were. A lot of “I slept with Claudious mom”, “Titanicus was here”, and other notes of that nature were found on the buildings in that city. \nFor those curious, THIS is a site of all the best graffiti. Some the best are:“Theophilus, don’t perform oral sex on girls against the city wall like a dog”” Weep, you girls. My penis has given you up. Now it penetrates men’s behinds. Goodbye, wondrous femininity!”” Palmyra, the thirst-quencher”“To the one defecating here. Beware of the curse. If you look down on this curse, may you have an angry Jupiter for an enemy.” (I love this one)“Defecator, may everything turn out okay so that you can leave this place”“I have buggered men” (seems to be the roman equivalent of “chat is moving so fast no one will notice I’m gay”)” Romula hung out here with Staphylus.”“Secundus likes to screw boys.”– Sven2774 Advertisement Advertisement 16 \n“There was a plant known to prevent pregnancies and the romans used it so much that they fucked it into extinction.”– dbatchison 17 \n“Not completely NSFW, but in the 1840 US presidential election, William Henry Harrison was portrayed by his campaign as an alpha male, then contrasted that image with then-president Martin Van Buren. They said that Van Buren hadn’t been seen in the company of a woman in years, they described him as often wearing silk shirts, and I don’t know how they claimed to know this, but they asserted that Van Buren took longer baths than any other president. \nBasically, they campaigned against the president by calling him gay.”– ImpedanceIsFutile 18 \n“Roman Emperor Nero had a young boy by the name of Sporus castrated and then married him. He would often appear in public with Nero making him wear the customary garb for a Roman Empress. Sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to Nero’s first wife who he kicked to death only a year before.”– streetsofnewreno 19", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:35:09.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
