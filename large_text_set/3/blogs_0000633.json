He didn`t train with us this morning,\" coach Zinedine Zidane told a press conference ahead of Saturday`s La Liga game. \nIn a list of players for the game published on the club website, Ronaldo was an absentee as was Welsh star Gareth Bale who has been banned for two matches following his red card against Las Palmas this week. \nWhile the Real squad was put through its paces on Friday, Ronaldo did sprints on his own. \nZidane will rest Ronaldo ahead of Real`s Champions League last 16 return game at Napoli next Tuesday. \n\"As you know, all matches are important but the most important is that the player is OK,\" Zidane said. \nA 3-3 draw at home to Las Palmas on Wednesday saw Real Madrid lose top place in the Spanish championship for the first time since October. \nRonaldo once again proved decisive in salvaging a point with two late goals against Las Palmas pulling Madrid back from the brink of a defeat. \nThey are one point behind Barcelona, but have a game in hand.
