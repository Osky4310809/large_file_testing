it has no army, access to nuclear codes, or power to unilaterally remove critical environmental and economic regulations.\nBut Trump has all those levers of power; without a free, aggressive press close by to see what he and and his administration are doing—and what favors they’re handing out to their powerful, special interest friends (drain the swamp my ass)—we will have something not much different than state-run media.\nGranted, the pathetic, let’s-play-Patty-cake-with-the-powerful state of our press today isn’t much better than state-run media—but what Trump is doing can make things much worse.\nWhich, in reality, is what he wants. In Trump’s mangled mind, he’s the only reporter the people need, and the stories in his mind are the most poignant and relevant to be told.\nJust like Fox News, who for two decades has made billions by creating an alternative story of America that makes data, facts, and reason irrelevant.\nFor the sake of ensuring we don’t dumb down America more than it already is, the entire press must come together—mainstream, independent, right, left, and “neutral”—to make sure America doesn’t become an uninterrupted Fox News marathon.\nI, for one, don’t want Bill O’Reilly shaping children’s minds.\n— —\nJordan Chariton is a Politics Reporter for The Young Turks, covering the presidential campaign trail, where he’s interviewing voters on both sides.
