Stephen R. Sylvanie Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sp 1 Brad Keselowski, 132 points (5 playoff points) A great start to the season for the 2012 champ, who won at Atlanta and nearly won again in Sunday’s Kobalt 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. 2 Consecutive runner-up finishes at Atlanta and Las Vegas have shot Larson up the standings. 3 Chase Elliott, 129 In each of the first three races, Elliott consistently ran near the front and he’s posted a pair of top fives in the last two races. 4 Martin Truex Jr., 127 (7 playoff points) Not only did Truex park his Furniture Row Toyota in Victory Lane at Las Vegas, he swept all three stages. 5 Joey Logano, 119 The most consistent racer of the year to date, Logano has finished sixth or better in all three races. 6 Ryan Blaney, 106 In his second full season with the Wood Brothers, Blaney has been excellent so far and so has the team. 7 Kurt Busch, 93 (5 playoff points) Winning the Daytona 500 means Busch’s season has already been successful, with more wins likely to follow. 8 Kevin Harvick, 91 (3 playoff points) In Stewart-Haas Racing’s first year as a Ford team, speed has not been an issue for Harvick. But luck, or lack of it, has been. 9 Kasey Kahne, 88 After missing the playoffs in each of the last two seasons, Kahne has gotten off to a quick start so far this year. 10 Jamie McMurray, 86 With teammate Kyle Larson ranked second, McMurray means both of team owner Chip Ganassi’s cars are in the top 10 in points. 11 Trevor Bayne, 82 Considering how slow Roush Fenway Racing’s cars were during the last two seasons, Bayne is looking pretty good right now. 12 Clint Bowyer, 73 As expected, now that he’s back on a stellar team, Bowyer is running much better than he did the last two years. 13 Matt Kenseth, 71 In 2015-16, Joe Gibbs Racing won 26 races. And the team won a title in 2015 with Kyle Busch. In 2017, they’ve won no races so far, with Kenseth JGR’s highest-ranked driver in points. 14 Aric Almirola, 70 After enduring a horrible 2016 campaign, Almirola and the Richard Petty Motorsports team have made gains this year. 15 Denny Hamlin, 68 Like most of his teammates at Joe Gibbs Racing, 2017 has been a struggle for Hamlin, who began 2016 by winning the Daytona 500. 16 Paul Menard, 62 Surprisingly, perhaps, Menard is ahead of both of his Richard Childress Racing teammates in the early stages of 2017. 17 Through three races Newman hasn’t finished higher than 17 th yet. 18 Three races and no top-10 finishes for the seven-time champion, which is definitely shocking. 19 Kyle Busch, 50 (1 playoff point) Busch’s 2017 campaign has failed to produce even one top-15 finish in the first three races. 20 Erik Jones, 49 Considering he got crashed out of the Daytona 500, Jones is doing pretty well for a rookie. 21 Michael McDowell, 49 Although he is ranked 21 st , McDowell is actually third-best among single-car teams, trailing only Ryan Blaney and Aric Almirola. 22 Matt DiBenedetto, 48 A top-10 finish in the Daytona 500 got DiBenedetto’s season off to a very good start. 23 Ty Dillon, 47 Raise your hand if you had Ty ahead of his brother Austin at this point in the season. Me neither. 24 All things considered, Whitt is doing okay driving for a small, one-car team. 25 Austin Dillon, 47 After making the playoffs last year, this wasn’t the start to the season Dillon was looking for. 26 Landon Cassill, 46 Cassill got his season off to a great start by finishing 16 th in the Daytona 500. 27 Dale Earnhardt Jr., 46 The 14-time NASCAR Most Popular Driver had his best result of the year at Las Vegas, finishing 16 th . 28 Daniel Suarez, 42 As you would expect of any rookie thrust in at the last minute, Suarez has had some early struggles. 29 Ricky Stenhouse Jr., 38 The left-rear axle on Stenhouse’s car came out at Las Vegas, dooming his hopes of a good finish. 30 Danica Patrick, 37 A late-race catastrophic engine failure knocked Patrick out at Las Vegas and set her back in points, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:03:20.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
