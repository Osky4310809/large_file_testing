The Uber car ended up on its side, and a third car was struck. Nobody was seriously injured. \nUber temporarily halted the program to investigate the accident and gain a better understanding of what happened, but a spokesperson said Monday the company will redeploy its fleet here and in Pittsburgh, where it also is testing. \nUber brought its fleet of self-driving cars to Arizona amid much fanfare last year following a dispute with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which requires companies operating self-driving cars to report on their operations. Arizona has no rules specific to self-driving cars. The company confirmed Monday it has been transporting customers with self-driving cars in the state. \nMORE: What we know about self-driving cars in Arizona \nThe vehicles use a combination of cameras, lidar and other sensors to guide them, though all self-driving cars operating in Arizona today have test drivers behind the wheel to take control if needed. \nIndications are Uber is far behind rival Waymo in developing driverless cars. The two are involved in litigation regarding the technology. \nWaymo, formerly known as Google's Self Driving Car Project, was involved in three crashes last year in Chandler, but did not stop its vehicle testing. \nThe California DMV reports include figures on how frequently the drivers must take control of the cars. \nWaymo drives its cars in California an average of 5,000 miles before a human driver is required to take over and handle an unusual traffic situation, according to its 2016 report to the California DMV. \nWaymo's figures are exponentially better than Ford, Tesla, Nissan and other companies with similar reports filed at the California DMV; however, each company may define the disengagements differently according to how their cars work. \nEven though Uber has returned some cars to California, it has not yet reported on their operations. \nHowever, some of its internal documents reportedly leaked to the media show the Uber vehicles tested in Arizona only traveling about 200 miles on average before needing a driver to take over, and only about 2 miles between unpleasant braking or jerking. \nUber officials declined to comment on the figures Monday. \nHere are some frequently asked questions on self-driving cars: How do they work? \nWaymo's vehicles use a system called lidar, which is like radar but using lasers, to scan for about 200 yards in all directions around the vehicle. Lidar can help the vehicles make predictions by determining which direction pedestrians are facing. The cars also use cameras, radar and internal maps that are more detailed than regular Google maps. For example, they include curb heights. Do the companies use different technology? \nYes. Tesla Motors uses a system called \"autopilot\" that is not intended to be fully autonomous. It also uses a series of sensors to keep the car in the lane and maintain a safe distance between cars, but it is not capable of point-to-point driving and requires drivers to remain attentive at all times. Tesla updates its software remotely to all drivers who have chosen to activate this feature on their cars. Waymo, Uber, GM and Ford are working toward cars that will operate without drivers and have dedicated employees testing their technology. \nThere are disputes involving the technology. In February, Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Waymo and Google, sued Uber. Waymo alleges that in December 2015, former Google self-driving car engineer Anthony Levandowski stole 14,000 files containing plans and technical specifications, then left the company a month later. He now works for Uber. Who is testing in Arizona? \nWaymo has a fluctuating fleet of vehicles operating out of Chandler, and its vehicles have expanded to parts of Phoenix, Mesa, Tempe and Gilbert. The company uses Lexus RX 450h and Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. It also tests vehicles in Kirkland, Wash., Mountain View, Calif., and Austin. \nUber's Volvo SUVs can be seen in several parts of metro Phoenix, but the internal documents leaked to the media in early March indicate the main testing for self-driving vehicles is up and down Scottsdale Road and around Arizona State University, where Friday's accident occurred. It also is testing in Pennsylvania and California. \nGeneral Motors is testing self-driving electric Bolt vehicles in south Scottsdale. It has similar tests in San Francisco. The company wants to bring the technology to market though a deal with Lyft, a ride-hailing competitor to Uber. \nFord is testing self-driving technology at the companyâ€™s proving grounds in Wittmann, north of Phoenix. It also is testing in California and Michigan. CLOSE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:56:36.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
