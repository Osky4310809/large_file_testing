And, no surprise, the phone is a powerhouse.\nEquipped with a Snapdragon 835 processor, an early AnTuTu benchmark suggests the Galaxy S8 is much more powerful than Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, a device many consider to be among the most powerful on the market.\nA video posted to Vimeo shows the Galaxy S8 with a score of 205284, destroying the iPhone 7 Plus’ score of 181807 (the iPhone 7 scores 173575).\nCurrently, the OnePlus 3T commands the highest benchmark score of any Android device at 162423. Obviously, the Galaxy S8’s Snapdragon 835 chip (and rumored 4GB of RAM) is going to provide users with plenty of power. It makes the LG G6’s decision to use the Snapdragon 821 chip that much more glaring.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com Power gains The Snapdragon 835 chipset is manufacturing using a 10-nanometer process, which results in improved performance and reduced power drain. The chip is also 35-percent smaller than its predecessor and offers 25-percent better graphics rendering.\nWe will see how well the Galaxy S8 performs under real world conditions when the device is finally available. Clearly, the Snapdragon 835 chip is going to be incredibly powerful, which bodes well for the future of mobile, not just the Galaxy S8.\nFor what it’s worth, Apple will use the same 10-nanometer process for its upcoming A11 series in the iPhone 8, so Samsung’s Galaxy S8 may not be the most powerful phone for long.\nSamsung will unveil the Galaxy S8 on Wednesday, March 29.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:01:13.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
