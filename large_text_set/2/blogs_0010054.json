As per latest reports, the movie has collected Rs 50 crore in three days. If the movie continues this steady run, it won’t be long before the movie enters the Rs 100 crore club. On day 1 itself, the movie got off to a brilliant start as it collected Rs 20 crore. What’s even more brilliant, the movie earned this impressive amount on a Thursday. On Saturday, the movie reportedly saw 90% occupancy. Looks like Suriya-Hari have another winner! The film was a typical commercial entertainer that followed the typical cat and mouse game. Suriya in his Durai Singam avatar was fearless, suave and effortlessly stylish. Although the story was decent and fast paced, the supporting cast put up a disappointing show. Clearly, Singam 3 is following the footsteps of Singam 2 that fared brilliantly at the BO. \nSingam 3 is the third installment of the popular cop franchise. The movie starred Suriya, Soori, Shruti Haasan, and Anushka Shetty. After fighting local goons, this time he took on an international case. Thakur Anoop Singh debuted in Tamil cinema as the lead antagonist in this film. The film is performing exceptionally, even overseas. Here’s what Industry tracker Ramesh Bala has to say – . @Suriya_offl ‘s #Si3 Overseas BO:#USA – $330,000#UAE – US$250,000#Australia – US$92,000#UK – US$50,000. Looks like the piracy threat hasn’t affected the movie’s BO collection in anyway. \nIn other news, Suriya’s next with Vignesh Shivan – Thaana Serndha Kootam has already gone on floors. It was for this movie, Suriya had to get rid of his handle bar moustache. Suirya will star opposite Keerthy Suresh for the first time. Post which Suriya will begin work on his talked about project with Selvaraghavan. When this actor-director duo announced their project together, it made the industry sit up, as Selvara is known for his unconventional films.
