\nAustralia’s coach named the new Inter Milan centre-back and the Bournemouth full-back in the final squad for two crucial World Cup qualifiers against Iraq and UAE despite both defenders barely having been involved in first-team football this season. \nPostecoglou added he doesn’t think either Socceroo will play both of the games, but he also admitted he didn’t want to select too many players that couldn’t partake in the two matches. \nThat’s what makes the duo’s inclusion slightly confusing. \nSainsbury is yet to feature for the Serie A giant after his January transfer from Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning, and Smith has played in just seven games for the Cherries this season. \nTheir selections saw veterans Matt McKay and Nathan Burns left out, while starlets waiting for a breakthrough opportunity - Craig Goodwin, Alex Gersbach, Ryan Edwards, Awer Mabil, Chris Ikonomidis - will have to continue waiting. \nHowever, Postecoglou still found room for uncapped 18-year-old Riley McGree (who has 12 A-League games to his name), Mustafa Amini, Jimmy Jeggo, and Rhyan Grant. \nWhen asked to explain why Smith and Sainsbury were both included in the final squad given their lack of minutes, Postecoglou said he was satisfied with the fitness levels of both players, but also admitted he was taking a “punt” when it came to Sainsbury. \nLIVE stream the Socceroos’

We’d prefer if they were playing,” said Postecoglou. \n“Trent has had no game time for quite a while; we’re taking a bit of a punt on him. \n“Trent in the past has been resilient for us and I’d like to keep him involved, he’s been a big part of what we’ve done. \n“Brad is getting to backend of the season so from his perspective physically I don’t think there’s an issue … he always comes into camp in good physical condition. \n“Data we’re getting, from a Premier league club, [says] he’s got fairly good fitness levels.” \nHowever, Postecoglou added that he doesn’t expect either player to play in both WCQs. \n“He [Sainsbury] won’t play in two games – he’s training very very hard in Italy, he’s got some very big loads,” said Postecoglou. \n“We’re comfortable he can get through a game.” \nOn Smith he added: “He’s [Smith’s] unlikely to play in both games but we’re comfortably with him coming in.” Brad Smith of Bouremouth in action. Source: Getty Images \nSainsbury (21 caps) and Smith (14 caps) have become regulars in Postecoglou’s set up, but their inclusion at the expense of in-form players - who could play both games - may have come as a shock. \nBut Postecoglou had another reason for picking them. \nBesides both being fit and having previously proven their pedigree in the green and gold, their positions are ones that the manager feels he has cover for. \nPostecoglou named seven defenders in the squad, but both Mark Milligan and Mile Jedinak have the capacity to fill in at centre-back, while Aziz Behich is another option at left-back. \nThe Socceroos captain proved that this past weekend , while Milligan has previously shown his versatility for Australia. \n“With Trent being a little underdone we’ve got to make sure we’ve got enough cover there,” said Postecoglou. \n“I think Millsy provides that for us – he’s shown he can do a job in both areas.” Mile Jedinak. Source: Twitter \nHowever, that wasn’t the case when it came to attackers. \nWhile Postecoglou said Goodwin was close to being picked in his winger position, he was left him because the manager didn’t want too many players that couldn’t play two games. \n“[Goodwin] was close to making this squad... We had to weigh up the balance,” said Postecoglou. \n“He had a few injuries and only just started [for Sparta Rotterdam] again. \n“We didn’t want to carry too many blokes we didn’t think would make two games. We had to make a decision between him and a few others.” Brad Smith and Craig Goodwin. Source: News Corp Australia \nThat didn’t stop Postecoglou selecting Robbie Kruse, who’s one of Goodwin’s main rivals for a winger spot. \nKruse is in a similar position to Sainsbury and Smith when it comes to game time after his move from Bayer Leverkusen to Chinese club Liaoning Whowin, but Postecoglou believes he’s in the right state to perform for the Socceroos. \n“He [Kruse] wasn’t getting regular game time in Germany but we all know his training loads in Germany he always presented in good condition he just needed to be playing,” said Postecoglou. \n“For Liaoning he’s played two 90 minutes. It’s been good for him, he needs that. Hopefully that means he comes in not just in good physical condition … but at least feeling confident. \n“He won a penalty in the first game, knocked in a cross for their goal on the weekend... hopefully he comes in in good form.” Robbie Kruse. Source: News Corp Australia \nThe other flank will likely be taken up by Mathew Leckie, who’s been in and out of Ingolstadt’s starting line up. \nPostecoglou expects Tim Cahill to come on and make an “impact” instead of playing full games, which just leaves Tomi Juric and James Troisi also leading the forward-line. \nJuric has found form, but only recently recovered from injury to make the squad. \nIn the centre of midfielder, there’s no shortage of options with the likes of Aaron Mooy, Massimo Luongo, Jackson Irvine, Jedinak, Milligan, Amini and McGree. \nHowever, the cut to 23 players doesn’t mean the seven players left out will play no part against Iraq and UAE. \n“The other seven are still on standby [if there’s an injury],” said Postecoglou. \n“The seven who missed out are still very much in contention.” \nSOCCEROOS SQUAD TO FACE IRAQ, UAE \nFULL 23-MAN SQUAD BY POSITION \nGOALKEEPERS \nMat Ryan (Genk, Belgium), Mitchell Langerak (Stuttgart, Germany), Danny Vukovic (Sydney FC) \nDEFENDERS \nRhyan Grant (Sydney FC), Milos Degenek (Yokohama, Japan), Trent Sainsbury (Inter Milan, Italy), Rhys Williams (Perth Glory), Bailey Wright (Bristol City, England), Brad Smith (Bournemouth, England), Aziz Behich (Bursaspor, Turkey) \nMIDFIELDERS \nMile Jedinak (Aston Villa, England), Mark Milligan (Baniyas, UAE), Jackson Irvine (Burton, England), Aaron Mooy (Huddersfield, England), James Jeggo (Sturm Graz, Austria), Mustafa Amini (AGF, Denmark), Riley McGree (Adelaide), Massimo Luongo (Queens Park Rangers, England) \nATTACKERS \nTim Cahill (Melbourne City), Tomi Juric (FC Luzern, Switzerland), Mathew Leckie (FC Ingolstadt, Germany), Robbie Kruse (Liaoning Whowin, China), James Troisi (Melbourne Victory) \nPLAYERS CUT \nAlex Gersbach (Rosenborg, Norway), Matt McKay (Brisbane Roar), Ryan Edwards (Partick Thistle, Scotland), Awer Mabil (Esbjerg fB, Denmark), Chris Ikonomidis (AGF, Denmark), Craig Goodwin (Sparta Rotterdam, Netherlands), Nathan Burns (FC Tokyo, Japan) \nHARRY KEWELL on FOX SPORTS 501: Make sure you tune into a big episode of Shootout on Thursday where Harry Kewell and former Arsenal midfielder Gilberto Silva will be on the couch.
