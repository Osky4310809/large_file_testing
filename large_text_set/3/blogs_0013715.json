Other specs are yet to be confirmed, but don’t expect any huge surprises.\nThe previous Guess Connect is a smartwatch hybrid featuring an analog watch face with a rectangular cutout for the digital display. Its Android functionality was somewhat limited because of this, but the sequel is set to ditch the previous approach in favor of entirely digital watch face in a quasi-analogue style. According to Wareable , there will be more than 100 combinations of watch faces, colors and subdials.\nSee also: Which smartwatches will get updated to Android Wear 2.0?
