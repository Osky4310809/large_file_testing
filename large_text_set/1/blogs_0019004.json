Here are the headlines from the last week:\nNintendo confirmed that Super Mario Run will be out on Android sometime in March. It should roughly coincide with the Nintendo Switch release. It will have been a long time since the iOS release so we’re not sure if the hype is going to be as strong. Hilariously, Nintendo plans on releasing Fire Emblem: Heroes on Android in February . That means Super Mario Run won’t be the first true Nintendo game on Android in 2017. Keeper Security released a report this week talks about the most popular passwords from 2016. It was not a great year. The most popular password was “123456” with various amalgamations of that taking up most of the top ten. Some of the other passwords in the top ten were “password”, “ ”, and “123123”. That’s not great news. Those who use passwords like that should seriously consider changing it. Google announced the 20 finalists for the European Indie Games Contest . Among those are Samorost 3, PinOut, Crap I’m Broke: Out of Pocket, Rusty Lake: Roots and many others. Some of these are very good games that we’ve talked about before. A few of the games aren’t out yet. We imagine that they will in due course. We’ll let you know who wins. Vine officially transformed into Vine Camera this week . The first iteration of the new app is actually pretty bad. It still records the six second videos as usual. However, since most platforms don’t loop, the videos don’t have the charm they once had. We think there could be something here someday. However, we wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t want to dive into the new app just yet. The Google Play Store and Apple App Store had a really good 2016. A new report showed that the respective app stores had more downloads, made more money, and had people spending more time in apps than in 2015. Perhaps the most interesting factoid is that 90% of the money earned on Google Play was done through mobile games. That kind of explains why there are so many freemium games. That’s simply where the money is. For even more Android apps and games news, updates, and releases, check out this week’s newsletter by clicking here !
