Despite making Chelsea's bench at the age of 15, the midfielder waited until he was 21 to make his debut. \nChelsea lined up with Chalobah and fellow academy graduate Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who also had an impressive game, against Peterborough, while Ola Aina made an appearance early in the second half. \nChalobah now feels a valued member of Conte's first-team squad and admitted he is delighted to have completed his first 90 minutes. \n\"It was a proud moment for me to complete my first 90 minutes at Chelsea,\" Chalobah said in response to a question from Goal . \"I am really happy. We have just got to going now, we are up there in the league at the minute. \n\"We are taking it game by game and there is still a long way to go in the season, anything can happen. This is good development at a club that I have been at from a very young age so we [young players] are all very happy. \n\"I think that's the dream [to make it at Chelsea], we have always thought of playing for Chelsea and we are doing it all together at the minute. The manager has got faith in us and he has given us the chance so it is something that we are proud of and all the young players at the club just need to keep following their dream.\" \nChalobah lined up alongside Cesc Fabregas against Peterborough on Sunday and is part of a strong stable of midfielders at Chelsea. He admitted that it will be tough to nail down a place in the line-up as a result, but says the chance to learn from Fabregas, N'Golo Kante and Nemanja Matic has been invaluable. \nBelotti is Europe's most complete No. 9 \n\"I just watch them every week and they have just gone 13 games unbeaten which makes it hard to get into the side,\" he added. \n\"Obviously there are a few players ahead of us [younger players]. So every week, every game, I just watch and learn from them because they have got the experience that I don't have yet. \n\"We are definitely part of [the first team], the manager has given us more responsibility to follow his philosophy and we are all learning.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T01:56:19.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
