We just treated him as a normal officer. \n\"He was so nice, and just made us work quite easy with him.\" \nCorporal Hari Budha Magar, 37, said Harry had joked \"stop following me\" after they met last week as he and the Prince of Wales presented Afghanistan operational medals to Gurkhas at Buckingham Palace. \nCpl Magar, from Kent, who lost both his legs above the knee in 2010, told Harry about his attempt next year to become the first double amputee to scale Mount Everest. Warm words: Prince Harry at the embassy (Getty Images) \nHe said: \"I am training at the moment in Nepal and Scotland, and he said, 'All the best for it'.\" \nHarry also joked with Captain Lalit Bahadur Gurung, who he trained with before they served together in Afghanistan. \nThe prince told him: \"Good to see you again, how are you?
