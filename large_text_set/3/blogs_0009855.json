That’s how Joey races. He’s going to get it.”\nLogano went on tell his side of story to Fox Sports. \n“There wasn’t too much talking, just a lot of swinging,” Logano told FOX Sports.\nAsked to describe the incident that set Busch off, Logano replied: “I don’t know. I was racing him right there at the end with our Pennzoil Ford. … Kyle and I usually race really well together and don’t have any issues. He tried to pin me down into the corner underneath Brad. We about crashed and I was still trying to gather it up in the center. I was going to spin out, so I’m trying to chase it up (the track) and he was there.\n“It wasn’t intentional, but obviously he thinks that. So I don’t know.”\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T01:47:46.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
