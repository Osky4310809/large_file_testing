People like you are the reasons why Nigeria is stuck in permanent reverse. You worship mediocre and incompetence while denouncing excellence. yommy \nExcellent point, God bless you Jazzy Jeff \nI am not surprised by the response of a mediocre like you that benefited from quota system and so also believes and insists on status quo! \nGet a life because whether you and your kins like it or not the free money will soon stop! Parasite!! victor \nas CBN governor, u dey form like say you get the same status as the president….. wake young man, ”respect is reciprocal” according to my seniors in sec sch….. lux fiat yommy \nWhat do you expect Mr Sanusi all these armed robbers called judge(s) will do anything to please them oga now, stop wasting your money and your time, nothing works in Naija, especially if you are trying to fight the corrupt people and corruption. What shame ayobamiba \nYou a highly ignorant Nigerian, your foolishness is very disturbing. let me inform you that sanusi whom you are defending stole and appropriated a whooping 160 billion naira without appropriation and without lawful approval. and when he was caught pants down he sent a dummy to ignorant Nigerians like you and hired APC propaganda machinery to distract Nigerians with bogus claims and inconsistent allegations against NNPC.his running around the courts can only delay but can not stop him from facing the due recompense for his corrupt criminal acts against Nigeria at CBN . yommy \nI don’t have time to trade word with people like you, perhaps you need to include the word mere “Allegations” in your dictionary. Let me remind you that was a mere allegations against SLS and your clueless government need to prove it. Just to juggle your shallow brain as of now Sanusi is innocent of all the allegations until proven guilty. ayobamiba \nIn your demented bewitched mind ,sanusi is innocent of financial recklessness, corruption and clear case of stealing arising from his 2012 CBN audited account he prepared and submitted to the President upon which queries were raised and his response to queries received and forwarded to the RCN a constitutional body saddled with the responsibility of investigating and dealing with such issues from CBN .now if in your demented bewitched mind you posts that sanusi is innocent until a competent court declares otherwise, how come you now accused NNPC of guilt on the bases of sanusi s blind ,malicious ,wicked allegations which is riddled with inconsistencies and almajiri somersaults. just to tarnish the esteem and image of govt and her agencies. eyobaba \nStack illiterate read the law before you open your big mouth to talk rubbish yommy \nHahahaha I dey laugh oooo. If Ode like you can just read between the lines you will be able to deduce nothing works in this country. If Stella Oduah was accused of corruption for many month and nothing was done by either your fantastic judicial system or your action Presido. But I understand shallow minded like can’t read between the lines. Please go and listen to Aunty Okonjo herself confirming that she was still paying for Kerosene subsidy after Mr President instructed her to stop or do you want us to talk about her not having a clue about NNPC operating a hidden foreign account (JP Morgan Chase) people like won’t know or what do you expect. I weep for my country seriously with people like you still believing in this Gov wow! Honesty we have no hope. anthony okonkwo \nYou are a compound fool, Odua’s case came up just few months ago and even when she was sacked you stupid people are not satisfied. Sanusi’s infraction was there since last year, so continue to defend the indefensible just because of APC phylosophy that an enemy of Jonathan is APC’s friend. adefowora \nIf nothing works in Nigeria, how come u can type ur garbage from the cesspool u call home and we read it here? Men, go take ur bath! yommy \nFor your information Mr Oponufowora, I am not clueless and I won’t stoop so low to trade word with you. I guess you have a stable electricity right now obviously with your generator blasting your head with 1mdcb of noise, your road is so smooth that you can afford to drive smoothly on it, perhaps your judicial system that set Olabode George, Tafa Balogun, Alamieyeseigha just to mention few free is working as well. But in my environment where I am, things are working but not in your clueless and corrupted way. Ogakris \nYommy, can’t you be civil in your posts? All your posts brim with so much hate and venom. We train children to be civil and polite in their use of words, in Nigeria of yore. yommy \nOgakris I’ll advice you to read my first post/comment before you jump into conclusion. I didn’t attack nor abusive to anyone but some people here are so full of that and the only language they understand is for you to reply them the same way. Ben Whonana \nThe case is not over yet.He filed an ex parte motion.The judge was unwilling to grant the reliefs he sought in his injunction without hearing from the other party to the suit.The motion was refused pending when the President,as the other party, is put on notice.The motion will be heard at the later date stipulated by the judge. \nDo not always be so quick to pull people down.Look well before you leap off your high horse. yommy \nThank you for your reasonable comment, but looking at the reputation and the antecedent of Nigerias judicial system you can deduce where this is going. tunana \nYomi, they’ve all said it all.i suppose u’re an educated illiterate yommy \nWhat do I expect from people like you that used North Korean dictator as a profile picture…..don’t make me laugh. Do you need a reminder how the so called judicial system set Olabode George free, do you need a reminder about D Alamieyeseigha, or a reminder how your wonderful judicial system messed up Bola Ige’s murder case till today. I know shallow minded like you won’t remember. Oponu Eze Chukwuma \nYou lack the ability for constructive criticism . Sanusi is toothless bulldog yommy \nTell me what is so constructive about your above comment. If you don’t know what to say please don’t. I don’t blame you, na chinko I blame if not for Tecno you go get mouth to talk YemiO \n“He explained that it was unsafe to grant far reaching interim orders which have all the attributes of a mandatory injunction without giving the defendants a hearing.” \nIf only the President had this in mind when he suspended Sanusi without the input of the senate where Sanusi would have been given a hearing. adefowora \nSanusi is fighting a lost battle. The court wont grant his prayers. Neither can any remedy be envisaged. He that goes to equity must come with clean hands! ogbuefiakajiaku \nPlease let us be objective here apart from crisis what else does the north contribute to Nigeria and it’s treasury yommy \nSir I share in your pain and your opinion, they contributed nothing but crisis, corruption, instability and looting of our national wealth. But this issue is not about what they contributed or not it’s about the right attitude to justice, if Sanusi is guilty of the allegation let him be dealt with according to the law of the land, and it anyone is guilty of corruption and embezzlement let them be dealt with too. This government is not ready to probe or prove Sanusi’s allegation against NNPC and honesty that’s a very wrong signal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:59:52.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
