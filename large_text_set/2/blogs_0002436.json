The year was 1961 when Pontiacs swept the top three finishing spots and five of the top six. \nThe race winner was Marvin Panch in a year-old No. 20 Pontiac owned and prepared by the legendary Smokey Yunick. \nPanch’s teammate, Fireball Roberts, dominated the race, leading 170 laps in his 1961 Yunick Pontiac. But the engine in Roberts’ car let go after 187 laps, handing the race to Panch. \nBehind Panch came Little Joe Weatherly in a Bud Moore-owned Pontiac, followed by the Ray Nichels Pontiac driven by Paul Goldsmith. Fred Lorenzen finished fourth in a Ford, followed by the Pontiacs of Cotton Owens and Jack Smith. \nA couple of other footnotes related to Daytona and the No. 20: \nMatt Kenseth currently carries the No. 20 on his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota. Kenseth is a two-time Daytona 500 winner but won both of his 500s when he drove the No. 17 Ford for Jack Roush. \nAll told, the No. 20 has been the winning car number in 50 NASCAR Cup Series races, but only four drivers have been to Victory Lane with that number: Tony Stewart (33 wins), Kenseth (14), Joey Logano (2) and Panch (1). \nOf those four, Stewart is the only one to never win the Daytona 500. Logano won it in 2015 but in the No. 22 Team Penske Ford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:45:08.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
