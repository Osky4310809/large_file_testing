It was eight years ago when they first showcased a flexible display, but it is now finally ready to turn concept into reality. Rumors about the Galaxy X keep emerging, and there's a chance it may even make its debut at MWC this year. What will smartphones look like in 2050? Samsung Galaxy X release date and price \nDemonstrating an exciting innovation like a foldable screen at MWC would be good timing, as it's been a pretty rough year for Samsung with the Galaxy Note 7 disaster and a corruption scandal in Korea. Samsung has been playing with the idea for a while, as you can see in the patents and video from 2013 below: \nAccording to the Korean outlet ETNews , industry sources say the firm will show off a prototype foldable smartphone at MWC to gauge public response. Screens that fold inward and outward might be shown. Samsung hasn't confirmed this yet, but it would be a big step forward if they were to pitch the technology to other device makers at the conference as well. Samsung Galaxy X foldable display \nEveryone wants a big screen, no one wants to carry it around. It's the paradox of the smartphone world that drives us crazy almost as much as battery life vs. battery size. Foldable screens are here to save the day. \nFirst things first, the Galaxy X will be foldable, but we don't mean \"foldable\" like your old flip phone. There has been separate rumor that Samsung has been working on a different foldable device (without a foldable screen) that would have a hinge like a laptop, allowing two AMOLED screens to rest on top of each other. To illustrate, check out the patent below. This is a foldable device, not a foldable screen. The Galaxy X isn't a flip phone. / © Samsung \nBelow, you'll see the patent for a true foldable screen. This is what we mean when we say the Galaxy X will be foldable. You'll actually be able to bend the screen without snapping it in half and rendering it useless. How well this will hold up over time could be an issue. Constant bending and pressure could cause screen damage, especially if you sit down with your phone in your back pocket. Bendable in the middle. / © Patently Mobile / Samsung \nHopefully Samsung will be able to design around a normal user's behavior patterns, which tend to include throwing your cell phone into bag full of stuff, dropping it, sitting on it and, even worse, letting your child play with it. Samsung and foldable screens: success story or epic fail? \nBelow you can see an old example of Samsung's attempts at making a curved screen, which show a somewhat thick and bulky design concept. Could the Galaxy X also be this bulky, or will it be thin and elegant? The success of the idea depends on the execution and Samsung's ability to design with the user in mind. This old concept phone with a curved screen doesn't bode well for the design Galaxy X. / © Mobile Geeks \nThe Galaxy X will have 4K resolution according to SamMobile , but not much else is known about the display's specs yet. It is rumored that the touch area will extend beyond the front of the device to its edges, and work like a Galaxy S7 Edge in that respect. Samsung Galaxy X design \nThe overall design of the Galaxy X could feature the same Galaxy DNA we're all used to, but there's no telling what could change due to the foldable screen. Camera, button, and fingerprint sensor placement could really affect the look of the device. The overall shape will obviously change, and rounded edges could make the device more ergonomic, both when folded and when open.
