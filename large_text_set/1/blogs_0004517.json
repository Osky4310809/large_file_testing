Greg M. Cooper-USA TODAY Sports \nJae Crowder wasn’t afraid to speak his mind Tuesday night. The same held true Thursday morning. \nCrowder drummed up controversy after the Boston Celtics’ win over the Utah Jazz, calling out Celtics fans for cheering Jazz forward Gordon Hayward and then continuing his rant in a series of angry tweets . \nCrowder’s comments forced both head coach Brad Stevens and president of basketball operations Danny Ainge to do some damage control , and at the Celtics’ practice Thursday in Waltham, Mass., it was Crowder’s turn to address the issue . \n“I was a little angry after the game, obviously,” Crowder told reporters, via WBZ’s Scott Sullivan. “I felt I had to say that to (the Boston Globe’s) Adam (Himmelsbach) after the game. I probably should have left it right there. I went on Twitter and said what I had to say, and that’s when I had the back-and-forth with fans on Twitter, and how I was feeling at the time.” \nThe Celtics forward suggested in one since-deleted tweet he’d have “no problem” leaving Boston, but he cleared that up Thursday. \n“Obviously I don’t want to leave Boston,” Crowder said. “Obviously I love it here. Obviously the fans have treated me great — no doubt about that.” \nCrowder said he deleted those tweets Tuesday night at the suggestion of the team . As for the subject of those tweets, though, the 26-year-old didn’t change his tune. \n“I still stand behind what I said about how I felt disrespected when (fans) were cheering for Gordon Hayward,” Crowder said. “I live with that. I stand behind that 100 percent as a man, as a basketball player who put my time away from my family for this. I stand behind that.” \nSo, how did he feel when C’s fans gave impending free agent Kevin Durant a warm welcome at TD Garden last season? \n“Yeah, I didn’t like that, either,” Crowder replied. \n“I just remember when I got here a couple years ago, and we were however many games under .500, the fans would cheer for us,” he continued. “Not one time did they cheer for another player when they came into town. Things have changed since then — I’m aware of that. But that’s never happened. That’s never happened in an arena I’ve been in. I’ve never been on the road and gotten cheered for or saw any of my teammates get cheered for by the opposing team(‘s fans). \n“So, it’s just something different for me that really tests me. I don’t like when they cheer for DeMarcus Cousins. I don’t like when they cheer for Kevin Durant. I don’t think you should do that.” MORE FROM YARDBARKER:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:17:01.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
