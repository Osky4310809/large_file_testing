Democrats planning stall tactics for Trump's Cabinet picks this week   1/9/17 12:01 AM   \nSenate Republicans will begin the confirmation process for President-elect Trump's Cabinet this week amid efforts by Democrats to stall the process. \nHalf a dozen nominees will appear at Senate confirmation hearings scheduled for Jan. 11. The Senate Judiciary Committee will start a two-day hearing beginning Jan. 10 to consider the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who is Trump's pick for attorney general. \n\"The priorities between now and Jan. 20 are hearings on Cabinet members,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \nBesides Sessions, the other nominees appearing are Rex Tillerson for state, Betsy DeVos for education, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly for homeland security, Elaine Chao for transportation and Mike Pompeo for CIA. \n  \nRepublicans had hoped to confirm many of the nominees on the 20th, the day Trump is sworn into office and can officially send the nominees to the Senate for a floor vote. \nBut Democrats are plotting to drag out the process, which could prevent Cabinet members from taking office for weeks. \nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., plans to target eight Trump picks, including secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, health and human services secretary nominee Tom Price and Sessions. \n\"Our caucus thinks it's absolutely essential that the U.S. Senate has a chance to appropriately vet these nominees and the American people deserve to hear their views and qualifications in public hearings, especially for the most powerful Cabinet positions,\" Schumer said. \nSchumer is demanding additional time to ensure FBI checks are completed, financial records are vetted and potential conflicts of interest are explored for each nominee.
