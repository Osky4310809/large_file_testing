He wants to win the game and he will do everything to win the game, even in training. \n\"There are big characters at the club, but they are good guys and that is most important. \n\"They know when they have to talk after the game, before the game, when they have to give confidence. Big characters but very good guys.\" \nUnited head into Saturday's home match with Watford aiming to extend a 15-match unbeaten run in the Premier League - a far cry from the chastening 3-1 loss at Vicarage Road earlier this season that left Mourinho livid. \nMemphis has everything to reach the top, says Wijnaldum \n\"Of course the manager was angry,‚Äù Fellaini said. \"We had the meetings, he showed us the mistakes and what we did wrong. \n\"It's normal. Since the beginning of the season, we have had a lot of meetings like that. It shows his character and how he wants the team to play. \n\"Now the manager has worked with the team since July, so he knows us better. As well, the players know each other and the understanding is better.\" \nFellaini has struggled to enjoy the kind of rapport with United's supporters as he did with the Everton faithful since moving to Old Trafford in 2013, becoming synonymous with David Moyes' ill-fated reign. \nHe was booed after conceding a penalty that allowed his former club to claim a 1-1 draw with United in December but insists the ordeal gave him \"more motivation to do better\". \nValencia: I thought my time at Man Utd was up \nDespite the presence of world-record signing Paul Pogba, the 29-year-old remains an important part of United's squad and revealed Mourinho offered assurances to this end before the start of the season. \n\"Jose called me and texted me on my holiday to give me confidence and say he trusts me,\" said Fellaini, who is now contracted to United until the end of next season after the club triggered a one-year extension clause last month. \n\"When a manager calls you and says you are part of his plans and that he trusts you, then you will give everything for him.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T16:44:44.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
