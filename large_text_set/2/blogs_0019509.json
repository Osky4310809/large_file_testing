The place is called Krimsey’s Cajun Kitchen, and it only recently soft opened after launching a while back as a catering company with big plans. The menu is a blend of Louisiana favorites (sans meat and dairy, of course), including an okra gumbo, hearts of palm po’ boy, and more.\nThe addition of Krimsey’s to the greater Los Angeles landscape shows the uniqueness of this city, where folks with dietary needs can still find the flavors they love, and where large swaths of land like the Valley can find ways to support such an endeavor. It also points to a strong Louisiana food base right here in LA, from places like Little Jewel of New Orleans to the strikingly good Preux & Proper in Downtown, now operating under Samuel Monsour.\nOccidental adds food trucks \nThere’s a new way to dine at Occidental these days, with the approved arrival of food trucks on scheduled days. The Occidental Weekly says meal plans won’t work for the rotating rigs, but no matter: the increased choice is bound to be a good thing for students.\nBludso’s party tomorrow \nBludso’s Bar & Que on La Brea is turning four years old, and to celebrate Kevin Bludso himself will be smoking up entire lamb legs and doing cheap beers and punch.

Party starts at 6 p.m.\nMuscle Makers in West Hollywood \nThe healthy-eating Muscle Maker Grill is coming to West Hollywood, landing a franchise location at 8000 Sunset Blvd. If you’re not familiar, the 22-year-old company does reasonably clean-eating meals and takeaway meal plans from locations across New Jersey, Arizona, Texas, and beyond.\nShabu Shabu style in Cerritos \nThere’s a new Japanese shabu shabu option opening in Cerritos called Broth Shabu Shabu.
