There’s now some New Year cheer, however, with news that the Korean firm is forecasting profit for its current Q4 2016 quarter to jump by 50 percent year-on-year. \nSamsung is estimating an operating profit of 9.2 trillion KRW ($7.75 billion) on sales of 53 trillion KRW, or approximately $44.6 billion. That sales prediction is less than one percent lower that what it booked one year ago for its Q4 2015. That’s surprising given the Note 7 saga — the phone was eventually recalled after some customers’ devices exploded due to faulty batteries — which was tipped to massively damage Samsung’s brand reputation not to mention weigh it down financially. \nKim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management, told Reuters that Samsung’s mid-range devices have helped it weather the storm. Further, steady component sales and the depreciation of the Korean Won may also be helpful factors for Samsung. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T13:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T08:41:32.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
