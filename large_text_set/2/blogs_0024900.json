I feel in good form.” \nSince the start of the 2014-15 campaign, Kane has scored more goals in all competitions than Barcelona ace Neymar and Atletico Madrid's sought-after Antoine Griezmann, and the same number as Sergio Aguero of Manchester City. Club goals since the start of the 2014-15 season \nKane’s 17 goals so far this season put him joint-top of the Premier League scoring charts, with Everton's Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal — even though he missed seven weeks with an injury suffered in mid-September. \nThe 23-year-old is now focused on retaining his domestic Golden Boot.
