Team-mate Dele Alli is already on 10 for the campaign, Son Heung-min has hit six and Christian Eriksen is on five. Kane was the top flight's leading scorer in 2015-16 and has another 13 this term (Photo: Reuters) \nAnd England striker Kane believes the way Spurs are sharing the goals around bodes well for them to succeed where they failed last season — pushing Leicester into early May before taking just two points from their final four games to finish third. \nHe said: “I think in any top team you need your striker scoring goals, and that’s what we’ve got in this league at the moment. But I think it’s important that you’ve got other players chipping in as well. \n\"Dele Alli’s on 10 league goals already. If you’ve got two or three players getting 15-20 goals a season I think you’re going to be right up there.
