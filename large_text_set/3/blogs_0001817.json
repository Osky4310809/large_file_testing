The pair made an appearance on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, during which they shared how the new mom is doing. EXCLUSIVE: Janet Jackson Spotted for First Time Since Giving Birth to Son “Janet had a beautiful baby boy. It’s all good,” said Jackie. “Everyone’s fine. Everyone’s great.” The pair, who will be joined by brothers Jermaine and Marlon for a 50th anniversary show in the U.K. in June, also talked about how the next generation of Jacksons will be influenced by their parents’ musical legacy. \"I guess it's in their blood,\" said Jackie. \"They watched us growing up when they were young. They love the business. If that's what they want to do, go ahead and do it.\" \nJanet and her husband, Wissam Al Mana, welcomed Eissa on Jan. 3 . The baby boy is the pop icon’s first child. Last month, she was spotted shopping at upmarket baby store Blue Almonds in London, England, but she has otherwise kept a fairly low profile since ET broke the pregnancy news in May.
