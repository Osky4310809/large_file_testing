You might want to find out if your son or daughter is picking on others, because it could cost you serious money.\nPolice in Shawano, Wisconsin, passed a new city ordinance that will allow officers to fine parents if they are notified that their child is bullying others and they don't do anything to stop it, reports WGBA. According to Shawano Police Chief Mark Kohl, he and fellow officers will work with the local school district to inform parents if their children are bullies. If they do not step in and their child does not stop picking on others, they will be slapped with a $366 fine.\nIf it happens again within a year, they will have to cough up $681.\nKohl said that most parents of bullies are not even aware of their children's aggressive behavior.\n\"It creates an avenue for us to work with parents to help find solutions,\" Kohl told WGBA.\nThe ordinance is intended to encourage parents to learn more about what is going on with their children and to direct them not to tolerate bullying behavior, which Kohl said can have detrimental effects on other kids.\n\"[Bullying] can lead to other things [like] drug use...and unfortunately suicide,\" he said.\nThe officer said that there are no \"initial complaints or concerns out there\" sparking the new law but that his department is simply \"being proactive working with the community to address this.\"\nThe ordinance has gotten a mixed reaction from local parents so far.\n\"I really believe that parents should discipline their kids in the right way and I think that's a good idea,\" parent Evelyn Roth told the station.\nThough most parents agreed that children need to be kind to each other, and parents should not tolerate bullying, others questioned why local police needed to generate money at the expense of parents.\n\"I think if the parents know that their kid is bullying, there should be actions done, but I don't know if they should get fined for it,\" Natasha Clark said.\nThe ordinance applies to both physical and cyber-bullying among minors.\nIf your child is bullying others, KidsHealth recommends punishing your child and teaching them appropriate reactions to anger, such as walking away, and finding out what deeper issues, pressures and frustrations that might be causing it and working to address them.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T03:33:58.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
