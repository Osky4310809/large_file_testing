There have been a lot of rumors and reports about this handset ever since. Samsung may only launch it in China initially but we’ve now spotted something that suggests the company might launch the Galaxy C5 Pro in markets outside the People’s Republic. \nThe Galaxy C5 Pro model number SM-C5010 was first spotted at the Wi-Fi Alliance in late December, this was the China-specific variant of the Galaxy C5 Pro. We’ve now spotted the same handset with model number SM-C501X at the Wi-Fi Alliance. While it doesn’t confirm anything right now, it’s a big indication that there’s a possibility that Samsung might launch this handset in markets outside China at some point in the future. \nAccording to previous reports , the Galaxy C5 Pro may feature a 5.2/5.5-inch Full HD display with a Snapdragon 625 processor under the hood coupled with 6GB of RAM, 64GB storage, a 16-megapixel front and rear camera aside from Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. \nSamsung is yet to even hint when it’s going to make the Galaxy C5 Pro official.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:12:56.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
