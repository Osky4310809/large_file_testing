Everyone should try to realise their full potential.” \nOn Change “Change will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other time. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.” \nOn Apathy “The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something.” \nOn Education “We have an obligation and a responsibility to be investing in our students and our schools. We must make sure that people who have the grades, the desire and the will, but not the money, can still get the best education possible.” \nOn 9/11 “It was not a religion that attacked us that September day. It was al-Qaeda. We will not sacrifice the liberties we cherish or hunker down behind walls of suspicion and mistrust.” \nOn Parenting “Loving, supporting parents – and, by the way, that’s all kinds of parents, that includes foster parents, and that includes grandparents, and extended families; it includes gay or straight parents – are the single most important thing. What makes you a man is not the ability to make a child, it’s the courage to raise one.” \nOn Having Faith “If we lose that faith, if we dismiss it as silly or naïve, if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace, then we lose what’s best about humanity. We lose our sense of possibility. We lose our moral compass.” \nOn Gun Control “My biggest frustration so far is the fact that this society has not been willing to take some basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who can do just unbelievable damage. We’re the only developed country on earth where this happens. And it happens once a week. And it’s a one-day story. The country has to do some soul searching on this.” \nOn His Achievements In Office “Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11. We have. We’ve blunted the Taliban’s momentum in Afghanistan, and in 2014, our longest war will be over. A new tower rises above the New York skyline, al Qaeda is on the path to defeat, and Osama bin Laden is dead.” \nOn Donald Trumps’s Election “To the young people who got into politics for the first time and may be disappointed by the results, I just want you to know: you have to stay encouraged. Don’t get cynical. Don’t ever think you can’t make a difference. Secretary Clinton said this morning, ‘Fighting for what is right is worth it.’” \nOn Immigration “My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too.” \nOn Michelle Obama “Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, girl of the South Side, for the past 25 years, you’ve been not only my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend. You took on a role you didn’t ask for and you made it your own with grace and grit and style and good humour. You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody.” \nOn Signing The Affordable Health Care Bill “The bill I’m signing will set in motion reforms that generations of Americans have fought for and marched for and hungered to see. Today we are affirming that essential truth, a truth every generation is called to rediscover for itself, that we are not a nation that scales back its aspirations.” \nHis Parting Message “Thank you for everything. My last ask is the same as my first. I’m asking you to believe, not in my ability to create change, but in yours.” \nThis article originally appeared on Vogue.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T14:24:16.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
