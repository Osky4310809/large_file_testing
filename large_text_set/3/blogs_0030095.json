By Alexis Romero   “It’s too much of a coincidence that all of these things are happening all at the same time,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said yesterday. File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - The attention given by The New York Times to the Philippines’ war on drugs is “curious,” Malacañang said yesterday, as it wondered why the newspaper is zeroing in on the country even if the United States has its own pressing issues. \nThe New York Times has released a feature story and a documentary depicting Duterte as bloodthirsty and obsessed with death. It has also published an editorial calling for an independent probe on the alleged extrajudicial killings under his watch and urging the Philippines’ trade partner to impose tariffs on the country’s products. \nThe feature story, documentary and the editorial were released in just one week. \n“It’s too much of a coincidence that all of these things are happening all at the same time,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said yesterday. \n“That particular newspaper, in normal course of events, would sequence its reports on certain topics. However, there seems to be rather focused attention on the Philippines. They do have a bunch of problems by the way in the US. I mean they can very well attend to it,” he added. \n“On the other hand, it seems rather curious that suddenly there is this rush of attention on the Philippine situation.”   \nAbella also frowned upon The New York Times ’ call for the international community to impose tariffs on Philippine products to make Duterte accountable for the killings. \n“You know, I think it’s beyond the scope of The New York Times to be able to make comments like that,” he said. \nAbella said he does not know of any effort by the newspaper to get Malacañang’s side on the issues raised by the article and the documentary. \nAbella previously said that The New York Times’ documentary, editorial and feature about Duterte reflect a “well-funded campaign” by some individuals and politicians to oust the President. \nHe declined though to identify any group behind the supposed campaign to discredit Duterte. \n“It seems to be orchestrated. That’s just my perception,” Abella said. \n“Well, let’s just put it this way: Who would benefit best from such an effect? The intention is, for example, to discredit the President and to apparently push it to its rational limits,” he added. \nAbella believes there is a disconnect between the Philippines’ relationship with the US and the American media’s depiction of Duterte and his administration. \nAbella cited what he described as the “very positive” and “very encouraging” meeting of Duterte with US Ambassador Sung Kim in Davao City last Monday. \n“Let me just point out some highlights. The President said that the Philippine-US relationship, relations at the bilateral level remain strong and there is a readiness to discuss more matters of mutual interest with the US,” Abella said. \nTrade Secretary Ramon Lopez denounced The New York Times editorial that urged the international community to revoke the trade privileges as part of sanctions against the Philippines. \n“Any form of trade sanction against the Philippines is uncalled for, unfounded and undeserved,” Lopez said in response to a New York Times editorial entitled “Accountability for Duterte” that was published last week. – With Perseus Echeminada, Richmond Mercurio, Joseph Lariosa  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:12:17.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
