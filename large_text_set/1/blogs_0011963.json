Here are five reasons to do so . He makes football fun, which is never a bad thing. That said, not everyone enjoys his dancing and other antics. Especially one Broncos fan on Twitter.\nIt all started so innocently with Twitter user JRuss tweeting some appreciation for Denver Broncos kicker Brandon McManus.\n@thekidmcmanus is probably the second coolest kickers in the NFL. Dude is all about this team. Rarity for kickers\n— JRuss (@JRussGrownUp) January 13, 2017 Hey that’s cool. And McManus even replied!\nYeah I think I'm second coolest too https://t.co/Kzwt2BXoHz \n— Brandon McManus (@thekidmcmanus) January 13, 2017 So far this is extremely harmless. But then, it got interesting.\n@thekidmcmanus if you started dancing after punts like that punk ass raider you'd take #1\n— JRuss (@JRussGrownUp) January 13, 2017 Before we just had a nice simple exchange between a player and a fan. Now we have JRuss calling King a “punk ass” and King isn’t going to let that slide.\nGet the Gloves I'll show u a punk. We can be the undercard in that Soulja Boy vs Chris Brown fight! https://t.co/XxyMdH7BnY \n— Marquette King (@MarquetteKing) January 14, 2017 As the legend Ron Burgandy would say, that escalated quickly. No word yet from JRuss if he plans to take King up on the offer to box.\nThis isn’t even the only time a NFL player has challenged a fan to a fight this season. A few weeks ago, a fan threatened to fight Rams running back Todd Gurley for not performing well enough on his fantasy team and Gurley invited the fan to “pull up.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T03:10:21.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
