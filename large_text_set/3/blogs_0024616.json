I expected that question!\" Deulofeu told reporters. \n\"It is great to hear these things, but if I didn't think in the present I would lose my mind. \n\"In football, I have learned to forget the past, think about the present and the future will come as it may - thinking about it would be a mistake. \n\"Currently I'm on loan at Milan, I'm owned by Everton and Barca have a buyback option. Right now I'm only thinking about Milan and the Spanish national team.\" Gran reencuentro con la selección!!! @gerardeulofeu pic.twitter.com/vyOjs03dPJ — Andrés Iniesta (@andresiniesta8) March 20, 2017 \nDeulofeu welcomed the positive impact his move to Milan has had on his career. \nHe continued: \"If I had not accepted Milan then I definitely wouldn't have been called to the national team. \n\"It is a great club and right now I am not thinking about anything else. I am very happy at Milan, the coach and his staff have given me a lot of confidence and I'm also happy with the relationship with my team-mates. \n\"When I learned of the interest from Milan I didn't think twice about it. If I'm in this form then it is thanks to the trust everyone at Milan has placed in me.\" \nDeulofeu only has one Spain cap - picked up in May 2014 - and is relishing the chance to return under Julen Lopetegui. \n\"I'm a more intelligent and consistent player over 90 minutes,\" he said. \n\"I am now preparing for matches much better beyond training and I have found the consistency Lopetegui and I were after. \n\"It was a big surprise to get the call and it makes me very proud to be with the national team. I want to help them.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:01:32.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
