(DIETHER ENDLICHER/ASSOCIATED PRESS)   6:27 PM \nKristi Yamaguchi is going to have to cha-cha her way out of this one. \nYamaguchi tweeted at fellow former Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan, who's currently competing on \"Dancing with the Stars,\" and wished her good luck by telling her to \"break a leg.\" So excited for you @NancyAKerrigan ! Can't wait to see you grace that ballroom floor, break a leg! üíÉüèª #DWTS ‚Äî Kristi Yamaguchi (@kristiyamaguchi) March 20, 2017 \nDirected toward anyone else, the sentiment is innocent enough. But the phrase takes on new meaning for Kerrigan, who famously had her leg bashed with a police baton at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 1994 in an attack planned by the ex-husband of her rival, Tonya Harding. The attack made the front page of the Daily News on Jan. 7, 1994. (Daily News) \nOf course, Yamaguchi likely wasn't throwing shade. The 45-year-old ‚Äî who herself won \"Dancing with the Stars\" in 2008 ‚Äî and the 47-year-old Kerrigan are friendly, and often competed on the same circuits together in the early '90s. Kristi Yamaguchi tweeted at Nancy Kerrigan to \"break a leg\" on \"Dancing with the Stars.\" (David Goldman/AP) \nFor her part, Kerrigan seemed unbothered by the tweet, and responded to Yamaguchi saying, \"Thank you @kristiyamaguchi for the advise!! It definitely is helping!\" Just was looking at this, I am adjusting to new contacts... #oops ! Thank you @kristiyamaguchi for the advise! It definitely is helping! #dwts https://t.co/UPeeSFZ1xG ‚Äî Nancy Kerrigan (@NancyAKerrigan) March 22, 2017 \nThe incident, carried out by a man named Shane Stant via Harding's ex Jeff Gillooly, made international headlines and lead to Harding getting banned for life from the U.S. Figure Skating Association. \nThe attack and its dramatic aftermath are currently getting the movie treatment, with \"I, Tonya,\" starring Margot Robbie as Harding, set for release in 2018.
