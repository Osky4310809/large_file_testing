Iwan Rheon is set to play Maximus in Marvel’s upcoming series Inhumans *, which will debut it’s first two episodes in IMAX in September before airing on ABC.\n*Different from the MCU Inhumans , try to keep up.\nThe Head of Marvel Television and Executive Producer of the upcoming show, Jeph Loeb, had plenty to say about why Iwan is perfect for the role:\n“Iwan’s ability to be charming, roguish, and still completely unexpectedly dangerous were all the different sides we needed to bring the character to life. We’re thrilled to have him on board.” Marvel’s Inhumans series is of course based on Marvel comics created way back in 1965 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The Inhumans are “a race of superhumans with diverse and singularly unique powers”. And Marvel has said that the show will cover uncharted territory–the story of Black Bolt and the royal family. Iwan’s character Maximus is the brother of the King and “fiercely devoted to the people of Attilan”. It will be nice to see him in what sounds like a much less evil role than the one he played on Game of Thrones .\nWant to learn more about Maximus? Scott Buck, executive producer and showrunner of the series, had this to say about the character:\n“Maximus is a complex character. Likable, charming, tragic and villainous all in the same moment, and I’m very excited to have someone of Iwan’s considerable talent.” Oh, so maybe he’s not a good guy after all? Find out when the first two episodes of Marvel’s Inhumans hit IMAX theaters in September. We can’t wait.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:48:58.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
