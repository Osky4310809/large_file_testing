Gottlieb had worked for CBS Sports, but Colin Cowherd reported Wednesday he will join him at Fox Sports 1 on April 24. Things could change now that Oklahoma State has a job opening following head coach Brad Underwood's departure for Illinois after just one season with the program. The 41-year-old Gottlieb was a player at Oklahoma State from 1997-2000. The alumnus provided his qualifications for the job Tuesday on Outkick the Coverage with Clay Travis. \"Oklahoma State desperately needs someone who doesn't just say, but will show great loyalty,\" Gottlieb said, via Wil Leitner of Fox Sports. \"I'm a son of a coach, a brother of a coach, I see the game like a player who's a coach, and I have an incredible amount of passion for my school, and my school was just jolted by a dude who was a false prophet.\" Per Brent Axe of Syracuse.com, Gottlieb also campaigned for the head coaching job last season before the team hired Underwood.
