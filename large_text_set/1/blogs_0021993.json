Posted 8 hours ago 2 \nOpeth frontman Mikael Akerfeldt recently explained just how delicate it is to be the band's primary songwriter. \nChatting with UG, the musician said there's much more finesse to the whole thing than you might think. \nAsked whether \"the other bandmembers bring in song ideas or riffs or do you basically write everything,\" Mikael replied: \"No. Well, Fredrik [Akesson, guitar] does come in sometimes with a couple of riffs. There's the one song that is co-written with him called 'Strange Brew.' He came in with a riff and I was like, 'That's interesting.' It was completely different to what you hear on the record. \n\"It had a waltzy type of thing with drums and bass and I just stripped it clean and saved the chord progression I really liked in there. I figured I could sing on this part and that's what starts the song. That was originally his idea but it sounds completely different. \n\"I came in with the notes on the guitar... I guess you would say arpeggio. Yeah, it happens that the guys present something that they've written. It's quite a sensitive thing because even if I'm the main songwriter, I tell everybody, \"If you have something, that's great.\" But I don't necessarily ask them to write something because I can't. That's never happened.\" \nExplaining how he always points out to the other guys that \"there might be parts [of their ideas] that I don't like and I'm gonna allow myself to strip it clean and just take the raisins out of the cake,\" the frontman added: \n\"It's probably very intimidating for them to bring something in because I am the so-to-speak writer. They want me to tell them. I never say, 'This sucks.' I try to be very sensitive about it. I say, 'I can't hear anything in this part but that part is great. We should do something with that.' I want to warn them before so you don't get that situation of stepping on toes too much. It's difficult for me to because I hate [to stifle] their creativity and I hate being the one that's gonna stop them in their tracks.\" \nHe concluded: \"But at the end of the day, I'm the one that's been with the band since the beginning and since we started recording and I've been writing 95% of the songs for 12 records. So I think I have earned the right to decide what's going on and what's staying out. \n\"A lot of people could throw the tyrant's card at me or whatever but a lot of people tend to forget that I too write a lot of stuff that is never used. I'm negative about the stuff I write but it's just that I tell myself and nobody else tells me. I've discarded a lot of stuff I write on the same premise that I discard stuff that other people write.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T03:14:21.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
