She explained, “The arts…brought me out of my shell. [O]n stage people see the characters I perform, the music I sing or dance to, and don’t judge me by my skin. I’m using my performances to educate others; the more people who understand the condition, the less they fear it.” She adds, “It’s amazing how far I’ve come.” Pretak’s success in the pageant world (she’s won three titles, including Miss Pennsylvania and Miss Congeniality) have given her a national platform to share her story. She works primarily with FIRST (the Foundation for Ichthyosis and Related Skin Types), traveling to schools and conferences throughout the country to educate people about skin conditions and discuss bullying. Most importantly, Pretak hopes her story—and her inspiring path—will help empower and inspire others with conditions that seem difficult to overcome. “It’s really important to meet other families, as you realize you’re not alone and there are people who understand what you’re going through,” she says. Up until now, Pretak’s travels and talks have been self funded. According to The Sun , however, she’s seeking sponsors to help her continue her powerful work. Pretak doesn’t appear to have a website where people can donate, but you can learn more about her mission, and stay up-to-date with her incredible work via Instagram .
