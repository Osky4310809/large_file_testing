He served as interim coach for the Buffalo Bills in the final week of the season after they fired head coach Rex Ryan .\nPreviously, Lynn was the Bills’ offensive coordinator. He began the season as the running backs coach and was promoted to the position when Ryan fired OC Greg Roman following an 0-2 start.\nThere were reports going around that Buffalo’s head coaching job was Lynn’s to lose, though general manager Doug Whaley said the team was conducting an “open search” to fill the vacancy, and the Bills decided to ultimately go with Scott McDermott.\nWhile the Bills struggled to gain yards through the air with quarterback Tyrod Taylor , their rushing offense was the best in the league. Led by running back LeSean McCoy, Buffalo ran the ball with ease throughout the entire season. The offensive line did a great job of carving out space for the star runner, which happened under Lynn’s watch.\nMcCoy used his speed, agility, and vision to make big plays. He finished the season with 1,267 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns.\nOn the other hand, Taylor couldn't complement Buffalo’s strong rushing attack with efficient passing. The veteran signal caller did not commit many turnovers, though. He simply didn't make a lot of big plays. Taylor struggled with accuracy as well. He threw for 3,023 yards to go along with 17 touchdowns and six interceptions.\nNow that Lynn is the head coach in Los Angeles, he will be tasked with leading a franchise looking to build a fanbase in a new place that has another fresh franchise in the area.\nLynn’s hiring fills five of the six vacancies, with the 49ers ’ being the only one remaining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:07:32.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
