REX/Shutterstock \nOne of Kim’s personal belongings stolen during the heist was reported to be a diamond ring worth nearly $4.5 million. Eventually, the robbers made off with an estimated total of $10 million worth of the star’s jewelry. \nShortly after the traumatic incident, Kim Kardashian kept a low profile as French police sought out to nail the perpetrators responsible for the crime. \nWhen she was spotted out in public by paparazzi in Los Angeles months later, she was hardly recognizable . \nKim eventually loosened up after a total of 17 suspects were arrested in connection with the robbery. REX/Shutterstock \nAlthough she was said to be contemplating a return to Paris for Fashion Week events this year, it was just recently she decided she would not return to the “city of lights” just yet. \nMost recently, new photos taken at the different areas of the crime scene, both before and after the heist, were released by French news outlet TF1. The first few photos show Kim’s empty room at the “No Address Hotel,” and the eerie vibes are strong… TF1 Here’s the bed where Kim had apparently been lying down prior to the incident. TF1 The duct tape used to tie her up was also found at the scene of the crime. TF1 This is the prop the group of armed assailants used to restrain the 36-year-old mother-of-two. TF1 Also included are photos of several suspects lingering around the area in extra spooky fashion. TF1 You have to admit, these photos are BEYOND creepy ! TF1 These photos captured by surveillance cameras positioned around the area helped piece together suspects throughout the investigation. TF1 A few of the suspects in the photographs peered directly at the camera. TF1 This particular photo was said to be taken prior to the robbery at a nearby coffee shop. TF1 The same men were spotted near the hotel. TF1 Just looking at these pics, you can clearly see why Kim refuses to return to Paris anytime soon. TF1 \nAs of now, a total of 17 suspects remain in police custody while only a few of them have been officially charged.
