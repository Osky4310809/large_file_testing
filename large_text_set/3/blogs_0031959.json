But it is also true what a player is worth and what we have here.\" \nDybala, Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti and Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin have been among the biggest names linked with a move to Camp Nou once the season is over. \n\"Those players are under contract with their respective clubs and especially when a player has a long-term contract, it is very difficult,\" added Robert. \n\"We are open to bringing reinforcements, to sign a player, and always have in mind the idea of improving the team, but to improve Barcelona's team, especially our first team, it's very difficult because we have a magnificent side. \nHow Liverpool keep youngsters grounded \n\"We have to give value to what we have – that has always been a great concern of mine. I do not like to say which positions to improve because we have a great team and that also creates a situation that I do not like.\" \nAnd Robert believes PSG would be unwilling to sell Italy midfielder Verratti. \nHe said: \"With these players it is always a matter of money, and apart from wanting to pay the amount you want, there is PSG not wanting to sell him to you. \n\"That decision is with the club, not the player. Do you remember what happened to Thiago Silva? PSG would not negotiate with Barca.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T09:05:40.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
