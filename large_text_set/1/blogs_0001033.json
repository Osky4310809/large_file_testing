Survey says this is the No. 1 answer Sleep.\n2. Masturbation People being comfortable masturbating in a partner’s presence would solve so many conflicts arising from mismatched libidos (even if the mismatch happens only rarely) or differences in ease of orgasm, but people tend to avoid it because they’re either uncomfortable with being that vulnerable or overly attached to the narrative that “sex is PIV and both people climax simultaneously and then it’s over”. People shouldn’t be threatened by a partner’s ability to give themselves pleasure.\n3. Making out How about just making out. I love kissing my wife I could do it for hours. It’s awesome during sex. Before it after it. When drunk or sober. Nothing keeps both parties in the mood faster than a great kiss.\n4. It rolls off the tongue Eating a pastrami sandwich, while watching a portable TV during foreplay.\n5. Make sure you do it properly Anal, done properly. A lot of people give it a try and do it wrong, so it hurts horribly, and they never want to try it again. The road to anal sex should be slow and filled with patience and gentle exploration and experimentation, with a long time (weeks or months, potentially) spent on just anal play with fingers and toys and working up in size before ever trying to involve a penis. Good anal sex never hurts, and just feels amazing (especially with some sort of clit stimulation at the same time).\n6. Going at it hard Handcuffs or some type of restraints.\nNothing like feeling no control whatsoever or having all absolute control in the situation during sex.\n7. Keep this in mind It’s not exactly a sex move, but place your bed on appropriate sized risers so that standing positions are easy. This is a big deal for me because I’m 6’6″ tall so I don’t want my knees to always be bent while having standing sex.\n8. Just this Laughing! My partner and I have so much fun in bed!\n9. “You’ve been a bad girl” Being spanked, especially when things get intense.\n10. Love you, pizza Getting drunk, fucking, then ordering pizza and eating it in bed.\n11. It’s not for just any couple Same-room play with another couple. It gives a great perspective on everything, it’s super fun, can lead to good friendships, and promotes a lot of communication before, during, and after.\n12. Rimming Licking ass is incredible, both for giver and receiver.\n13. Feel the vibration Bring a vibrator to use in conjunction with PIV sex.\n14. Find a second source of stimulation My girl loves foot stimulation. We discovered her superpower.\nIts like a second clitoris. With changing rhythm I tickle her feet and kiss lick suck them. She goes crazy.\nShe is very ticklish when not in a sexual context. But in an intense tickle fight I had her leg captured and I was tickling her feet. In that moment she learned how to switch between tickle mode and pleasure mode.\nI’ve given her orgasms just by touching her feet before. I love it! Makes getting her off really easy.\n15. Light choking You’d be surprised how quickly it can bring her into a sexual state of mind and how masculine you can look/feel from doing it.\n16. This is important Listening and talking. Can’t have good sex if one isn’t happy.\n17. Bondage A little less control can mean a whole new world of fun.\n18. Eating her out Giving cunnilingus with the girl on her hands and knees, and just totally immersing your whole mouth and face into her vulva and asshole. Seriously. My gf and I did this once straight out of a shower: she fucking loved it and i almost think I loved it even more! It feels great just sucking and licking absolutely everywhere around the area while being able to grab onto her ass and legs and stomach and tits and just pulling your face into her. It helps if she arches her back and puts her upper body down towards the bed rather than resting on her arms in order to give you better access to her vulva and clit, and if you kneel off the side of the bed so your neck isn’t so twisted. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T05:01:19.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
