The order on immigration banned refugees from entering the US for 120 days, and established an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. But the order goes far beyond blocking refugees, and has resulted in detention of visa holders, and general confusion about foreign entry into the country. Scientists, students, and veterans who cooperated with the US military in Iraq are among those who have reportedly been detained, questioned, or denied entry into the country. \nTechnology companies including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Uber, Netflix, and others have responded with varying degrees of concern or outrage, as protests at New York City's JFK airport and other locations around the country grew on Saturday. \nWe will continue tracking the fallout of the order, and reactions from companies and leaders.
