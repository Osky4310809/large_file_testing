I figured by the time my wedding came around, some poor soul (probably an aunt on his side) would take pity on me, and somehow know that a stand mixer had been sitting on my heart's registry for more than a decade. \nIt had always been too expensive and, frankly, too big for my New York City kitchen to handle. Until that Christmas. So in Love \nI wasted no time getting to work. Ooey, gooey, Nutella-stuffed cookies? I made them. Brownies from scratch? Coming right up. German chocolate cake? No problem. My new mixer looked so good gleaming on my kitchen counter, I felt like I had been promoted from home dabbler to real baker. I started bookmarking all the recipes I had deemed too difficult for just my OG bowl and spoon. I could finally stop ignoring recipes that started with, \"In the bowl of your stand mixer … \" \nNow that I had a stand mixer, I was determined to prove that I had the chops I'd always hoped I had. I baked passionately and enthusiastically. \nThere was nothing I wouldn't try; I even shredded cooked chicken breast with my mixer, at the behest of one ill-fated taco recipe. The Beginning of the End \nBut as it happens with any new relationship, as the newness wore off, I started coming up with a list of things to complain about. The machine barely fit in my kitchen and I had to get rid of stuff (sorry, knife block!) in order to make room for its large footprint. To boot: When I tilted the head back, it hit the uppers in my kitchen if I wasn't careful — which, admittedly, is more the fault of my kitchen than the machine's. No matter what attachment I was using, I still needed a spatula to really incorporate all of my dry ingredients into my wet ones. At that point, I was back to manual labor. I thought this machine would do the hard parts for me? The attachments were much harder to clean than my trusty spoons and spatulas ever were (especially after said shredded chicken decision). It looked so pretty, I started worrying about messing it up. Sure, it took up valuable space on my counter, but what if I used it and something happened to it? It's Complicated \nI started noticing that more and more weeks were passing where I didn't even reach for my beloved mixer at all. And I'm ashamed to admit that for one particularly bleak stretch in the winter, I used it for one thing and one thing only: to whip cream for my hot chocolate. And while, yes, those hot chocolates were delicious, I'm sure it wasn't exactly the reason the stand mixer was invented. \nThese days, I certainly don't use my stand mixer as much as I thought I would. It's more of a show piece. A pretty car (that rarely gets driven) in a garage. \nThat's not to say that I don't still reach for it now and then to make another batch of cookies. I even got the pasta maker attachment for my birthday three months ago (I just, um, haven't used it yet). I'm just saying that I reach for a bowl and spoon more often than I reach for the machine's plug.
