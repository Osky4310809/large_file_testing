Advertisement - story continues below \n“I stand by everything I said, including the offer to go to the United States if Chelsea Manning’s sentence was commuted,” Assange said in an online news conference from the Ecuadorian embassy in London. \n“It’s not going to be commuted [until] May,” he said, adding there would be “many discussions” on his future before Manning’s release in four months. \nObama declared Tuesday that Manning’s prison sentence was too long and that he had served enough time. \n“The notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished, I don’t think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served,” the president told reporters.

John McCain, R-Ariz. \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said, “Chelsea Manning’s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation’s most sensitive secrets. President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won’t be held accountable for their crimes.” \nObama also claimed that Assange’s offer to turn himself in had nothing to do with the decision a day later to commute Manning’s sentence. \n“I don’t pay much attention to Mr. Assange’s tweets, so that wasn’t a consideration,” the president said, referring to the WikiLeaks tweet Jan. 12 detailing the possible arrangement. If Obama grants Manning clemency Assange will agree to US extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case https://t.co/MZU30SlfGK \nAssange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012. He fears that if he leaves he will be arrested in relation to rape allegations in Sweden, and then taken to the U.S. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
