However, he decides it’s a challenge and starts to wreak havoc on National City. Mon-El (Chris Wood) has seen beings like Mr. Mxyzptlk on Daxam and knows how dangerous they can be. He and Kara argue over how to get rid of Mr. Mxyzptlk, further straining their relationship. \nMeanwhile, Alex (Chyler Leigh) and Maggie (Floriana Lima) celebrate their first Valentine’s Day together. \nStefan Pleszczynski directed the episode written by Jessica Queller & Sterling Gates. \nMr. Mxyzptlk is a powerful \"fifth-dimensional imp\" whose battles with the Man of Steel are defined by a sense of fun and mischief more than malice -- but that doesn't mean there won't be destruction when he comes to town. Mxyzptlk's idea of a good time is to make a building come to life and start walking around town, crushing everything in its wake while it throws a temper tantrum. \nIn most versions of the mythology, Mr. Mxyzptlk can only come to the DC Universe every so often; when he's sent away, usually by being tricked into saying or writing his name backwards, he returns to his own dimension and comes back only once the \"rules\" allow him to. \nThere are some stories that have reinvented him as a more \"serious\" threat with darker understones, including Countdown to Final Crisis and the Grant Morrison run on Action Comics which came at the beginning of DC Comics's 2011 contunity reboot, The New 52. It seems unlikely that a show as light as Supergirl , though, would take one of comics's most lighthearted villains and make him anything too dark. \nCreated in 1944 by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Ira Yarborough, Mr. Mxyzptlk features heavily in the recently-reprinted World's Funnest collection, in which he faces off with his fellow god-like, childlike imp, Bat-Mite. Supergirl will not be the character's live-action debut; he previously appeared in The Adventures of Superboy , Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman , and Smallville .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:53:44.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
