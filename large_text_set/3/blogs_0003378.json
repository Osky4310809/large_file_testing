The case was filed in September 2016. \nThe court presided over by Justice Nathan Musa, acquitted the former Secretary to the State Government, Mr Andrew Welye, and Former Commissioner of Finance, Mr Sunday Lamurde, who stood trial with the former governor on same offenses of 17 count charges. Ex-Governor Bala Ngilari: Jailed five years \nDelivering judgement, Justice Musa, said that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that Ngilari violated the Public Procurement Act of the state by awarding contract for the procurement of 25 vehicles for his commissioners at the cost of N167 million without following due process. \nHe said Ngilari’s action amounted to executive lawlessness. \nMusa said that the five years was the least he could give Ngilari, whose lawyer, Mr Samuel Toni (SAN) pleaded for leniency “in view of his (Ngilari) invaluable contribution while he was the governor of the state during the trying moment of insurgency.” \nMusa said that Ngilari would serve the sentence in the prison of his choice in the country “but for now he should start with Yola prison.” \nMusa expressed hope that the conviction and sentence of Ngilari would serve as a deterrent to serving governors who engage in doing things without following due process. \n“It is my hope that this conviction and sentence will serve as deterrent to serving governors..” \nThe judge however discharged and acquitted Welye and Lamurde, saying that the prosecutor could not prove the case against them. \nNgilari told newsmen before he was taken away from the court that he would appeal the sentence.
