At the time, Matt said he was being teased and called “DJ Duggar” and “Duggar’s boy toy.” He went on to say that it inflicted upon him “prolonged pain and suffering, anxiety, depression, embarrassment, humiliation, loss of self-esteem and extreme and severe mental anguish and emotional distress including but not limited to frequent panic attacks, disruption of sleep and insomnia, mood changes, fits of anger, a loss of interest in pursuing both professional and personal endeavors, and a complete loss of self-confidence.” \nMatt also said that because of what Josh Duggar did his family, who is very religious and close, were also dealing with harassment over the pictures being used. He said that Josh, acted willfully, maliciously and impressively … with full and deliberate disregard for the consequences [to McCarthy]” and that McCarthy “reasonably fears that he will continue to be shunned, avoided, embarrassed and subjected to ridicule.” \nAfter this all happened, Josh Duggar spoke out in a statement and apologized. He admitted to it all. Josh said, “I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. I am so ashamed of the double life that I have been living and am grieved for the hurt, pain and disgrace my sin has caused my wife and family, and most of all Jesus and all those who profess faith in Him.” He also went on to go to sex rehab to get help. Since then, Josh is still with his wife Anna Duggar, and things are going well for them. They are actually expecting their fifth child right now. \nJosh may be dealing with a lawsuit, but his marriage seems to be fixed. At this time, he is still not allowed to be on any of the Duggar shows on TLC. Instead, they even make sure that they hide him from the cameras at events such as his sister Jinger’s wedding. \nAre you surprised that Matt McCarthy made the choice to file a lawsuit against Josh Duggar for using his pictures?
