The one great exception is likely the old ‘90s Toyota lineup, which boasted a family of three interesting sports cars. Now there’s hints that this best part of the ‘90s may be coming back.\nThat original lineup included the Supra, Celica, and the mid-engined pocket rocket MR2.

A good, affordable mid-engined car is sorely needed in the market today, and would provide some good competition to the Miata/Fiat 124.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:33:54.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
