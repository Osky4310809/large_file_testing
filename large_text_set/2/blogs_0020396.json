Actually, don’t coz then we might fall short of our cute for the day. I mean, no seriously! One look at the above picture and you will know what we are trying to say. While up till now we were only getting to see them twinning in matching outfits or say walking hand in hand like the cutest love birds in town. This time they decided to further up their level of cuteness by also twinning their half-ponies together. Yes, can you believe it? Probably this is the first time Mira has tied a half pony for she usually prefers leaving her hair open but then when in love, guess they have their own belief on “those who make their hair together, stay together” Sounds lame but you know how cheesy lovers can get, right?
