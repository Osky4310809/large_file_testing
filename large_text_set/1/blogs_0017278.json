Anti-Trump Inauguration Day protests break out across US, around the globe (VIDEOS, PHOTOS) By 0 24 \nUnable to make it to Washington, DC for the inauguration, hundreds of people took the streets from New York City to Oakland in anti-Trump protests. \nIn New York, City Council member Jamanee Williams was arrested along with others as over 200 people protested outside Trump Tower. \nOne activist made use of the Manhattan skyline by flying a small plane over the Hudson River trailing a banner that read, “We outnumber him! Resist.” \nIn Boston, hundreds of protesters chanting, “Education, not deportation,” rallied outside the State House on Boston Common. \nIn Chicago, several hundred people rallied in Daley Plaza for their anti-Trump protest, waving Mexican flags during a march. \nStudents at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) chanted, “Not my president!” and “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go!” \nThere was a bit of a musical twist as well. \nIn Maplewood, New Jersey, several hundred Columbia High School children walked out of class and headed to the town hall, as girls chanted, “My body, my choice,” and boys responded, “Her body, her choice. \n“Protests today were reflective of the fact that schools are a microcosm of society,” school Supt. Dr. John Ramos told the Village Green. “If we consider what is going on across the country, we should not be surprised that there is a reaction in schools. Some of our students determined to make a social statement. As always, we should pay attention to what our students have to say.” \nIn Oakland, California, protesters rallied at City Hall, chanting, “No racists, no deportations, no borders!” \nA sign read, “We will not go quietly back to the 1950s,” which seems to hark back to the repressive era for so many – women, gay and lesbians and African-Americans and indigenous groups. \nHundreds were out in Los Angeles, despite heavy rain that lasted hours. \nActivists worldwide also took part in Inauguration Day protests, from Kathmandu to London, with the campaign slogan, “We build bridges, not walls.” \nActivists set off rainbow-colored smoke on London’s Vauxhall Bridge, with the slogan “Queer solidarity smashes borders.” \nA sign reading ‘Open Minds’ was held aloft the Millennium Bridge near St. Paul’s in London. \nAnd in Oxford. \nProtesters in the city of lights, Paris, also joined in. \nAnd Berliners said their bridges were built against fascism. \nVia RT .
