The ability to present a trophy has nothing to do with one’s gender.” \nViewers watching Sunday’s Grammys will see three trophy handlers, including transgender model Martina Robledo, actor Derek Marrocco, and model and actress Hollin Haley. \nHe’s right. \nGender isn’t important in handing out a trophy. \nSo why is it necessary that you spell out that there will be a man and a transgender model, if it isn’t important? \nLet me answer that for you. \nBecause it fits the current political agenda that you want to be highlighting. \nOtherwise you wouldn’t mention it at all. \nThe only thing that’s important in passing out a trophy is that you don’t trip and drop it on the floor. \nIt isn’t about politics.
