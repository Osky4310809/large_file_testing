Homosexuality is unnatural and perverse, an abuse of our sexual facilities. It is ‘shameful,'” part of Johnston’s post read. Facebook froze her public account “The Activist Mommy” Feb. 9 and took down the post, saying it did not follow their community guidelines. \n“I responded with just scriptural commentary and that is considered ‘hate speech’ by Facebook. It was just very intellectual and it was just a commentary on what the Bible says. There was no name calling or anything like that,” Johnston said about her response . \nWhen the ban was lifted, Johnston, wrote about it and reiterated her stance on homosexuality. Facebook took down her post and froze her account for an additional seven days. \n“That ticked them off and they didn’t like that at all. It was going viral. Just within a few hours, they had banned me again and they were going to make it more painful,” Johnston said . \nThis was not the first time Johnston has been banned on Facebook for her posts. Last year, she posted a video to her “The Activist Mommy” page that upset gay activists. \n“The fact of it is that the people who have more influence and a following as conservative Christians and have a larger voice in the culture are at greater risk for this type of thing happening,” she said . \nSend tips to [email protected] .
