But then I remember hearing someone call ‘Bilal’ from the house. \n“I just thought he was doing something silly so I didn’t think anything of it. \n“The next thing I know, I hear my name, hear Bilal’s name so I turned around thinking he had just run off. \n“She was pointing and then I looked down.” \nBilal’s aunt said she hadn’t seen or heard Bilal leave the house and was only aware when she looked out of the front bedroom window. \nShe then ran down the stairs and out of the front door where she saw Bilal in a crouching position, looking to his left before she saw the car go past. \nMrs Yasfa Aslam said: “I can still remember the feeling of my foot hitting the door frame. I just froze. I thought the car had missed him.” Read More Agony of teenage mum after her 'bubbly and mischievous' 19-month-old toddler dies suddenly in his sleep \nClio driver Benjamin Brown and his passenger fiancee Chelsea Hayman stopped at the scene and helped police with inquiries. \nMr Brown said he could not see any pedestrians and did not see Bilal until he heard noises on the car and looked in his rear view mirror. \nA police investigation concluded that Mr Brown was only going at around 21mph, less than the 30mph speed limit at the time. The road’s limit has since been reduced to 20mph. \nPC David Poole, of Greater Manchester Police , said as parked cars obstructed his view of the small boy, there was no way Mr Brown could have seen Bilal in time. \nHe calculated it would have been between 0.72 and 2.89 seconds from the time Bilal left the pavement to the impact with the car. \nMr Walsh said: “Bilal’s death was a devastating tragedy of extreme proportions. \n“I have a picture of him being a very loving and very normal three-year-old little boy. He had a playful and sometimes mischievous manner for which he will be sadly missed. \n“In his short life he touched his family immensely and I’m in no doubt that his family will remember him even if their time with him was short.” \nMr Walsh concluded that Bilal died from multiple injuries sustained in a road traffic collision.
