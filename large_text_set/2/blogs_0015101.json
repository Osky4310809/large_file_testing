In this day and age of everything being filmed and broadcast online, you’ve really got to step your game up to make an impression. 2 \nWhen this Illinois bro decided to propose to his girlfriend, he knew just the gesture to ensure she would say yes. You see, like any warm-blooded American, she’s a total McNugget maniac. Don’t act like you don’t know what I’m talking about. It’s trendy to diss the boot shaped chicken treats, but deep down you love that deep-fried goodness. 3 \nWe’ll call her “boo”. Apparently “boo” is so deep in her nugget addiction that she “constantly tags him in Facebook posts relating to nuggets” and would “die for chicken nuggets.” She obviously takes her fried processed meats very seriously. That’s wifey material if I’ve ever seen it. 4 \nSo, when your soul mate loves her McNuggets as much as she loves you, there is only one thing to do. You take that ring you just pawned your retro game collection for and you stick it in a nugget. Bro presented the nuggets and got down on one knee. She said “YES!” She also agreed to marry him. 5 \nMaybe the golden arches should follow Taco Bell’s lead and start hosting McMarriages?
