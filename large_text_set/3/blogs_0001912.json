Jo-Ann Petinglay, spokesperson for the Western Mindanao Command, said soldiers belonging to the 2nd Scout Battalion clashed with the bandits in Barangay Bud Taran in Indanan town at around 5:15 p.m. \nPetinglay said the wounded soldiers were brought to a hospital at Camp Teodulfo Bautista in Jolo for treatment. \nShe said an undetermined number of bandits were also wounded in the gunfight. \nPetinglay said there was no reported sighting of any kidnap victim during the encounter. \nThe clash occurred as Joint Task Force Sulu led by Col. Cirilito Sobejana intensified its operations to rescue the remaining hostages of the Abu Sayyaf.   \nThe bandits are still holding a Dutch man, a Korean, seven Indonesians, five Malaysians, six Vietnamese and five Filipinos. \nThe military has yet to confirm reports the gunmen who attacked a Vietnamese cargo vessel off Tawi-Tawi and took six crewmembers last week were Abu Sayyaf bandits.
