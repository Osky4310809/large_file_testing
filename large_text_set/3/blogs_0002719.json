Multiplayer will be playable there. \nIn a string of follow-up messages on Twitter, BioWare producer Fernando Melo stated the choice to cancel was a \"long story but right decision for how close we are to live\". Sorry we won't have MPTT. I know many were looking forward to it (as were we). Long story but right decision for how close we r to live 1/4 — Fernando Melo (@DiscoBabaloo) March 2, 2017 \nAnother post showed a screenshot of the multiplayer mode's character selection screen. It's our first official confirmation that, as expected, you'll be able to play as non-human races. \nSalarian, turian, krogan and asari are all selectable: Meanwhile, we'll get some more MP info out - let's get the ball rolling... see you all soon in Andromeda! 4/4 pic.twitter.com/FuhGpuat9f — Fernando Melo (@DiscoBabaloo) March 2, 2017 \nMultiplayer was a surprisingly great addition to Mass Effect 3 - and Andromeda's co-op mode appears to be following the same template. Matches see you and three other players take on waves of enemies. It's also the game's only chance to play as a non-human character. \nLast month I played four hours of Mass Effect Andromeda and came away impressed - although the game's multiplayer modes were not on offer.
