I think it’s fair to say there won’t be any surprises left once the device becomes official at Samsung’s product launch event. We’ve heard there will be a new Gear 360 camera, a new Gear VR headset, and that there will actually be a docking station for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ that will let you connect the device to your PC.\nMost of the leaks lately have been specifically for the Galaxy S8 and S8+, but we haven’t heard much about the PC docking station that seems to carry the name DeX Station. There were some images leaked in a Galaxy Tab S3 system dump that showed an illustration of the device, but that was about it. Up until that point, we could assume the DeX Station dock would let us connect our Galaxy S8 or S8+ to the PC’s monitor with a cable and then we could interact with our phones directly from a larger PC monitor.\nIn a new leak though, we were able to learn about some more technical details about the new DeX Station that Samsung will be launching with the upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+. Samsung will use the term “ Samsung Galaxy Desktop ” to describe the experience, and that it will have a fan to actively cool the device. This active cooling could be necessary since the DeX Station has an HDMI port that will let you export 4K video at up to 30 frames per second .\nThere also seems to be two USB 2.0 ports on the back of the DeX Station, and there will be a 100Mb/s ethernet port back there as well. This will let you connect a wired keyboard and mouse to the device for your Samsung Galaxy Desktop experience, and not be forced to use WiFi or even your cellular connection for internet connectivity. The leak also reveals that Samsung plans to price it at €150 .\nSource: WinFuture ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:57:37.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
