It tied with Sanya Phoenix International Airport in China. \nGimpo had led the field for six years but relinquished the top spot to Haikou Meilan International Airport in China in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T08:00:51.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
