This makes the iPad a little thicker than the Air 2 -- 7.5 mm to 6.1 mm, respectively -- and you'll struggle a bit more to see past reflections, particularly outdoors. Apple did increase screen brightness and says the color accuracy is comparable to its Pro models. Apple How does the new iPad compare to the iPad Pro and Mini 4? \nThe existing iPad Pro models remain unchanged for now. While there is a sizable starting price difference between the 9.7-inch Pro and new iPad -- $270, to be precise -- you gain a lot for the money including: Apple's True Tone display with a wide color gamut Faster A9x processor Smart Connector for keyboard support Apple Pencil support f2.2 12-megapixel camera with True Tone flash 4K video capture with cinematic video stabilization 5-megapixel FaceTime camera Four-speaker audio LTE Advanced support \nLikewise, stepping down to the iPad Mini 4, which now comes in just a 128GB version for $399 or $529 with Wi-Fi and cellular, you lose some screen size, of course, but you also lose some processing power: The Mini has an older Apple A8 processor. Otherwise they're pretty much the same. \nThe iPad Air 2 was a favorite -- even after more than two years -- and a lower price and potentially faster performance is unlikely to change that opinion. If you have a Pro model, there's nothing new to see here and you're still ahead when it comes to performance. The new iPad just gives the lineup a better entry point and an updated option for education use. However, looking at the new models, it definitely seems like Apple is getting away from simple tablets and steering people toward its Pro models.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:06:18.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
