Gnarly doesn’t even begin to describe this sport. \nBut there’s much more to it than meets the eye; we’ve spoken to the experts and found out all there is to know about Red Bull Crashed Ice. \nLook no further for your Red Bull Crashed Ice 101 . Where it all began Red Bull Crashed Ice is fastest sport on skates © Predrag Vuckovic/Red Bull Content Pool \nThis is the 16th season of Red Bull Crashed Ice. Since the first season, in 2001, the sport has grown exponentially and now stops in nine locations around the world, including Finland , Saint Paul and Marseille . The skills Cameron Naasz shows off his skills © Andreas Langreiter/Red Bull Content Pool \nYou need much more than a pair of sharp skates and some shoulder pads. You need the full gamut of physical skills including, but of course not limited to: stamina, cardio, strength, power, speed, coordination, and balance. \nIf you happen to have all of that though, be fair warned that you also need the mental aspects to a successful career in Crashed Ice: motivation, will and visualisation. \nHowever, as any Crashed Ice champion will tell you, all of your training and skills can be thrown out the window if you’re not standing at the top of the track with one thing: confidence. The course The 2017 track in Marseille © Red Bull Media House \nAs the athletes have ramped up their game on the ice, the course has also gone to the next levels to test the athletes. According to former Crashed Ice skater, Reed Whiting , “the track difficulty and design has such a huge effect on these races, as certain features will get in the minds of athletes and can severely affect their performance.” \nSo with the course playing to various mindsets, does that mean a new champion will be crowned? Only time will tell. Two ways to go down Taking off at the start of Red Bull Crashed Ice © Jörg Mitter/Red Bull Content Pool \nAs the saying goes, there are many ways to skin a cat, and this is ever true for Red Bull Crashed Ice. As the players catapult themselves down the icy highway, there are two ways to get down the track. \nOne: by way of pedal to the metal. “Some guys just go all out right away take more risk; by doing this they learn the track faster and up their qualification time,” Whiting said. \nTwo: slow and steady wins the race. “Someone like Marco Dallago who goes does the track very slowly on the first run and then systematically ramps things up,” Whiting added. So who do you choose for your favourite? \nReed Whiting has given us his picks for the 2017 season, and so without further ado here they are: \nCameron Naasz: He showed glimpses of complete dominance last year after kicking his training into gear during preseason. If he was on top of his game during the off-season, he’s going to be tough to beat. \nScott Croxall: He always seems to be right in the mix of things year after year event after event. He cannot be overlooked and I’m sure if gunning for his title back after such a close final race in 2016. \nMarco Dallago: I think Marco is going to surprise some people this year. He came off a tough year with multiple injuries and I know he is looking to come back win a world championship. Marco and his brother Luca live and breathe this sport and are always coming up with innovative ways to train and take things to the next level. Tommy Mertz wipes out © Andreas Langreiter/Red Bull Content Pool \nTristan Dugerdil: He continues to get better and better each year. I 100 percent expect him to be in multiple finals of the 2017 season. \nDean and Dylan Moriarity: These two could win any given event in 2017. They always seem to be first out of the gate and they seriously have the quickest feet in the sport. Dylan is coming off a season-ending injury though, so he'll be looking to come back with a bang in 2017 \nLuca Dallago: The wild card in the bunch. He is one of the most skilled athletes on the tour, but has never quite found a consistent groove over the course of a season. If 2017 is the year he puts it all together, he might just be competing for a world championship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T13:36:52.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
