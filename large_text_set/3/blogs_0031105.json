This technology is expected to generate 25,000 MW hours annually. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe WHTE facility is expected to mitigate the negative effects of power service interruptions, help reduce dependence on high-cost power sources, and reduce the cement plant’s carbon footprint, the company said. \n“Promoting energy efficiency is one of Cemex’s objectives in advancing resource generation best practices. We are delighted to see the good results of our partnership with Sinoma since the successful construction of the first WHTE project in one of our plants,” said Cemex Philippines president Pedro Palomino. \n“We are pleased to be working with Cemex once again and we are positive that the upcoming project will contribute significantly to Cemex’s operations,” said Zhang Qi, Sinoma-EC chair. \nApo Cement operates as a building material supplier and cement producer. It has a plant located in Cebu, founded in 1921, which produces Pozzolan and Portland cement under the APO Cement brand. \nCemex said it would continuously seek to improve its performance as an “efficient, agile, and innovative” company by identifying, sharing, and implementing best practices across its global network of plants and facilities. \nThe company said its industry-best processes would allow it to satisfy the needs of its customers while using the optimal amount of resources. \nCemex is one of the leading cement producers in the Philippines based on installed annual capacity. It produces and markets cement and cement products, such as ready-mix concrete and clinker, in the Philippines through direct sales using its extensive marine and land distribution network. \nThe company’s cement manufacturing subsidiaries have been operating in the Philippines for over 17 years with well-established brands, such as “APO,”“Island,” and “Rizal,” each of which has a multi-decade history in the country. \nCemex is an indirect subsidiary of Cemex S.A.B. de C.V., one of the largest cement companies in the world based on annual installed cement production capacity. The shares of CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. are listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:17:26.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
