We’d have our own Hollywood but in Hull… Hullywood!\n“I wanted to create a project and body of work that involved the people of Hull as participants and collaborators in a playful way whilst allowing me to create photographs that people would enjoy looking at and engage with.”\nThe photographer told BuzzFeed News: “Participants are asked to choose their Hollywood character, film, moment, and Hull location. A meet-up is arranged and the photograph is then published on the HullywoodIcons.com website, which publishes a new icon every day on its blog, Twitter, and Facebook.”\nThe art project Hullywood Icons will be exhibited throughout the city as projections in January. Budworth is planning to shoot a further 200 film recreations.\nTake a look at some our favourite photos from “Hullywood”.\nID: 10319110 Back to the Future , Mark Westwood and Ian Bond View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318892 Cast Away , Jim Wardlaw View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318888 Forrest Gump , Paul Martindale View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10319092 Blade Runner , Michelle Dee View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318877 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe , Charles Huckvale and Liz Dees View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318876 Pulp Fiction , Jo Hall View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318882 The Goonies , Clare Powell, Nick Stapleton, Richard Powell, and Melanie Carr View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318878 Misery , Sean and Camilla McAllister View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318879 Harry Potter , Kira Abel View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318881 Kill Bill , Andreya Nancy Young View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318900 Notting Hill , Rupert Creed View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318884 When Harry Met Sally , Emma Wilkinson and Tish Lamb View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318893 Planes, Trains and Automobiles , Robert Jamieson and Adrian Martin View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318894 Star Wars , Jean Todd View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318896 Borat , Andy Williams View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318890 The Wizard of Oz , Jane Green, Grant Davison, and Rachael Hindle View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318897 Pirates of the Caribbean , Kevin Young and Gareth Hughes View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318899 Mean Girls , Sam Kitchen, Bethany Watson, Eleanor Churchill, and Nicola Taylor View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10319088 Napoleon Dynamite , Nanette Thompson and Lee Halls View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10319089 Ghostbusters , Georgina Garton View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10319090 Shaun of the Dead , John Jackson View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10319094 Trainspotting , Sarah Jayne Curry View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10319091 Brokeback Mountain , Graham Jenkinson and Colin Wilson View this image › \nQuentin Budworth \nID: 10318885 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! \nMatt Tucker is the UK picture editor for BuzzFeed and is based in London.
