We know basically nothing about it at this point, apart from the fact that it'll probably house a number of delayed features that were supposed to show up in the Creators Update, like MyPeople.\nSo without further ado, this is our wish list for Windows 10 Redstone 3.\nMyPeople \nThis is an obvious one, but only because Microsoft announced it as a feature for the Creators Update, but had to push it back at the last minute. MyPeople was, in my opinion, the most exciting \"for everyone\" thing that was supposed to arrive with the Creators Update, so I'd definitely like to see it show up in Redstone 3. Perhaps it'll be able to hook into third-party services too?\nProject NEON \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:13:14.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
