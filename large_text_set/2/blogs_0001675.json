Terry McAuliffe confirmed on Wednesday that international food and beverage maker Nestlé S.A.'s U.S. division has signed on as an anchor tenant at Monday Properties' 1812 N. Moore St. in Rosslyn, a major economic development win for the commonwealth at a time when uncertainty reigns over Northern Virginia's sluggish office market. McAuliffe was scheduled to make the announcement at the 35-story tower Wednesday afternoon, but he gave up the news during an economic conference in Falls Church in the morning. 3 photos Swiss-based Nestle S.A. plans to relocate its U.S. headquarters from Glendale,… more \"They are going down to Arlington to a big building that was built before sequestration,\" McAuliffe said. \"That building had been vacant for four years.\" The deal is likely to involve significant economic development incentives, a tool the county and commonwealth have turned to increasingly to help bring down Northern Virginia's bloated office vacancy rate. As I first reported exclusively in November, Nestlé has been in the market for between 150,000 square feet and 200,000 square feet as an alternative to the Switzerland-based company's U.S. headquarters in Glendale, California. It had narrowed down its search to 1812 N. Moore and 1900 Reston Metro Plaza in Fairfax County, sources have told me. Nestle's main U.S. headquarters is based in Glendale, where it occupies nearly 380,000 square feet under a lease set to expire in about four and a half years, according to CoStar Group Inc. The lease would fill a major gap in 1812 N. Moore St., a 580,000-square-foot building that delivered in late 2013 and has been awaiting its inaugural office lease since then. Arlington County, where the office vacancy rate hovers at around 22 percent, has been working with Monday to fill the space but has lost out on several larger deals. Monday, backed by Goldman Sachs , has declined to break up the building to for smaller tenants, holding out instead for a major anchor tenant. Arlington, and Virginia have been locked in a regional incentives war for major employers like Nestlé to offset a downsizing among federal agencies and private employers alike. The county and state teamed up to offer at least $2 million to tech firm OPower to keep the company from moving out of Arlington , but only after losing to other local governments for major employers including the National Science Foundation and The Advisory Board Co.
