That was the message, among other oddly inspirational tidbits, when Schwarzenegger took over Snapchat’s Discover feature yesterday for the Governator’s “Lifting with Arnold” segment. If you missed it, Schwarzenegger turns up to the gym on a bicycle in high socks and shorts and starts fielding questions from celebrities and average Joe workout bros alike while he lifts . The seven-time Mr. Olympia and two-time California governor might be the funniest lifting coach we’ve ever heard, and yes, he still wants you to “get to the chopper!” while he’s doing curls. \nThis is perhaps the best free lifting and life advice you’ll ever get, so listen up. One user asks what he should do about his small calves. “You’re worried about your small calves?” asks Schwarzenegger. “I don’t think they’re that small! But train your calves every day, minimum ten sets.” Then Kevin Hart asks Schwarzenegger if he can “shoulder bop,” and Schwarzenegger sees his bop, adds a waltz step, and challenges Hart to yodel. And perhaps against his better judgment, Schwarzenegger asks users to do their best impressions of him. Eight-time Olympic medalist Apolo Ohno answers the call, instructing Arnold to locate the chopper in the type of Austrian-English Schwarzenegger made famous decades ago. Watch the rest of the video to see Schwarzenegger do impressions of himself and dole out the gym knowledge as only an internationally famous human bodybuilding god can.
