Yep, you read that right. Qatar Airlines is offering 0 dollar “golden tickets” for flights to dreamy locations like Cape Town , Dubai, and the Seychelles. Could there BE anything better than that ? What better excuse to take some time off work, splurge a little on local food and fun and maybe a hotel, than FREE transportation to and from? Of course, there’s a catch.\nThis promotional deal is part of a treasure hunt; those that find the ~secret~ flights will have to pay the taxes and fees, but the base fare is, as advertised free. Luckily, we’re not flying (jokes for days) totally blind when it comes to looking for the golden ticket. You don’t have to buy any chocolate bars, or sign up for any email lists, or take any surveys. Qatar released a video that gives us some idea as to how we’re going to locate these rock bottom priced flights, and we’re seriously taking notes.\nAfter watching the video, you’ll need to visit the Qatar website between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. EST on Thursday, January 12th and search for your preferred dates from any of Qatar’s U.S. cities to the Treasure Hunt’s featured destinations. A d you just might find your $0 airfare.\nThe featured locations are as follows: Dubai, United Arab Emirates (DXB) in February, March, and April 2017\nRas al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates (RKT) in February and March 2017\nYereven, Armenia (EVN) in February and April 2017\nTbilisi, Georgia (TBS) in February 2017\nThe Seychelles (SEZ) in February and April 2017\nCape Town, South Africa (CPT) in March 2017\nHappy hunting, ya’ll.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:10:21.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
