Ok, fine. We’re officially on board. \nWell, from the sounds of things, that was only the beginning. According to a report from Variety , Beyonce is Favreau’s first choice to play Nala. Hell. Yes. Pride Rock is about to be lit, y’all. Now, unfortunately it is not quite a done deal because Queen Bey is currently pregnant with twins ( she already had to drop out of Coachella due to her pregnancy). However, the fact that it is a voice acting role would allow for some flexibility, and “sources say the studio and director will do whatever it takes to accommodate her schedule.” Yeah, I bet. \nListen, we can complain about the endless parade of remakes flooding cinemas, but we’re clearly going to keep seeing them . As long as they continue to be good to great and attract top notch talent, it’s hard to knock them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:10:07.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
