This time she's accusing the White House of putting American lives at risk. These are more than statistics, they’re American lives at risk because this administration willfully ignores the science. https://t.co/gacdRsTcQp — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 29, 2017 \nClinton's tweet came shortly after President Trump signed an executive order rolling back President Obama's climate change agenda, which the administration argues will spur American energy while protecting the environment. \n\"My administration is putting an end to the war on coal,\" Trump said at EPA headquarters Tuesday . \"I want to thank the miners. You know, my guys get enough thanks. These guys haven't had enough thanks. They've had a hard time.\" \n\"We’re going to have safety, we’re going to have clean water, we’re going to have clean air, but so many [regulations] are unnecessary, so many are job-killing,” Trump continued. \nYou can read the entire executive order here . The first policy in the order states, \"It is in the national interest to promote clean and safe development of our Nation's vast energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production, constrain economic growth, and prevent job creation.\" A far cry from \"American lives at risk.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:24:36.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
