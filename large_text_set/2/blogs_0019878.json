The shoot was initially going to happen in USA but the makers then changed the location to Singapore. We had exclusively revealed to you guys that the cast and crew will be shooting some of the episodes in USA. But apparently things did not work out and also President Donald Trump’s Anti-Indian polices made it more difficult to the makers to finalise the location. All the actors, including Devoleena Bhattacharjee and Mohammad Nazim, have gone to Singapore for the shoot with the crew. \nThe show will witness yet another leap with Gopi finding her son, with Aham, in Singapore. We will also see the entry of Rohit Suchanti as Gopi’s son. Actually Gopi had birth to twins along with Vidya but Daai stole the son and ran away. Rohit Suchanti is a handsome lad who has done shows like MTV Warrior High, Sasuraal Simar Ka and BCL. He has studied film-making from US so the accent comes naturally to him. He is apparently very close to producer Vikas Gupta and Ekta Kapoor and is one star to watch out for.

See, we told you there will be a lot of drama in store for us. Later on, Gopi and Jaggi will bring their son to Modi house. And at last, Sita will be seen getting married to him. Though his Singapore girlfriend will also be seen who will come to Modi house asking for him. So with the Singapore episode, the leap episode of Saath Nibhana Saathiya will further complicate Gopi’s life with his son and his love story. So much masala, don’t you think?
