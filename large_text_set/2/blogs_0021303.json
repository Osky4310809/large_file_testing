In fact, the Free Thought Project recently reported that Sir Edward Heath, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has been accused by the police chief as being a pedophile. His vile crimes against children were allegedly ‘covered up by the establishment.’ \nThe former Prime Minister’s home in Salisbury was memorialized as a museum in 2015 to mark the 50th anniversary of Heath becoming the Conservative party leader. However, the exhibition is a glaring embarrassment now as dozens of his former victims have come forward exposing his disgusting sexual crimes. British citizens refuse to patronize this shrine to a monster, so it sits empty. \nApparently changing road signs and landmarks dedicated to historical figures has become too costly after many of them have been exposed. “There can be significant cost and practical difficulties associated with changing street names should that be necessary in future years,” a Local Government Association (LGA) spokesman told The Independent . \nA large chunk of this expense was realized after BBC TV presenter Jimmy Savile was exposed for abusing scores of children over the course of decades. Many buildings, roads, and charities bore his name because of his ‘contribution to society.’ However, they have since all been renamed.

In fact, in 2015, Margaret Thatcher’s government was exposed for covering up a major pedophile ring. \nFor decades, some of Britain’s most powerful politicians were exposed for murder and child rape. However, all of these allegations were swept under the rug and remained unchecked thanks to a concerted effort by the power elite to cover it up. \nAs the Daily Beast reported, More than 30 years later, an inquiry into allegations of child sex abuse rings, murder, and cover-ups has been launched by the British government after Scotland Yard detectives said they believed statements by victims who claimed they were systematically abused as young boys at sex abuse parties attended by judges, politicians, intelligence officers, and staff at the royal palaces. \nThese murderous pedophiles acting as judges and politicians are likely immortalized on signs and landmarks throughout Britain. \nNaturally, there is opposition to the recent guidelines from politicians who think that naming roads after each other is a great way honor themselves for years to come. \n“I’m frankly staggered someone has spent time and energy coming up with these guidelines,” leader of Barking and Dagenham Council Darren Rodwell told The Telegraph . “If this was thought up years ago, Churchill would not have places named after him and, who knows, we would have had to think twice about naming Trafalgar Square.” \nHowever, given all of the revelations on pedophilia coming out of the U.K. establishment, the recommendation to stop memorializing potential child predators is hardly a bad idea. After all, think of how it must feel to be a victim of one of these monsters and have to walk by a statue of them every day of your life.
