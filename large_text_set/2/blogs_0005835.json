It makes the six-game stretch heading into the all-star break, which began with Monday’s game against the Dallas Mavericks , pivotal for a Denver. \n“This is an interesting time of the year,” coach Michael Malone said before the game, the Nuggets’ fourth in five nights. “Everyone’s trying to steal games, but everyone is feeling it. You just have to go out there and find the energy.” \nThe Nuggets had enough energy to produce one of their finest defensive performances of the season in a 110-87 rout of the Mavericks at the Pepsi Center , an impressive start to a stretch that will include games against the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors . \nDenver, which improved to 23-28 while maintaining a grasp on the eighth slot in the Western Conference playoff race, suffocated Dallas during a game-changing second quarter. The Mavericks shot only 4-of-19 (21 percent) in the period as the Nuggets turned a 29-24 lead after the first 12 minutes into a 59-37 edge at halftime. The 13 points the Mavericks scored in the second quarter were the fewest any Denver opponent has had in a period this season.
