If you have a compatible device, you slot it into a headset, pick up the dedicated remote control, and you're away. It launched in November 2016 , and initially Google only worked with a few hand-picked companies on apps. \nThis approach is understandable: It means that Google can ensure that only the very best experiences are available to showcase its new technology â€” something especially important given the full-on nature of virtual reality. \nAs the company says on its page dedicated to quality requirements for Daydream apps , \"designing apps for VR is substantially different than for other platforms, particularly because poorly designed applications or performance issues can make some users feel nauseated.\" \nIn other words: A bad smartphone game might annoy you, but a bad virtual reality app could make you want to vomit. \nThe flipside of this strategy is that the selection of apps is necessarily limited. (We've rounded up 16 of the coolest ones that are currently available here .) By releasing guidelines and letting anyone submit Daydream apps for inclusion in the Google Play app store, the selection available is likely about to get significantly broader. \n\"To ensure a great user experience, apps for Daydream must follow specific requirements for performance and usability. Only apps that meet the following quality criteria will qualify as a Daydream app on Google Play,\" Google tells developers. \"Qualifying as a Daydream app will make it easier for Daydream users to discover your app on Google Play and allows your app to appear in Play Store VR.\" \nRight now, there are only a few phones that are compatible with Daydream, including the Pixel, Google's flagship smartphone. (Google wants to ensure that phones are sufficiently powerful to avoid performance issues.) \nBut as more Daydream-ready phones launch throughout 2017, Google is betting that this smartphone-focused model is the best way to encourage ordinary people to take their first steps into virtual reality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T11:49:24.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
