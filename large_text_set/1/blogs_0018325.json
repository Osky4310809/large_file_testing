You might not be able to sever all ties at one go, and continue being friends or talking and that's okay. But, if you really want to get over him(or her) and move on, there are some things that you need to cut out from your life, right away! 1. Stop stalking them on social media \nJust block them. No seriously, the urge to go to their profile and check their pictures is going to be there at all time, but if you've blocked them, there isn't much you'll be able to do. 2. Stop hanging out with common friends \nWe aren't saying cut them out of your lives completely, but when you are in the process of dealing with your broken heart, it might not be a great idea to go drinking with them. You'll always be tempted to know more about your ex's life, and that is certainly not going to help you get over the hurt. 3. Stop holding on to the memories \nMusic that reminds you of them, pictures that you both clicked, movies you watched, things you bought together ... everything needs to go. We aren't asking you to pull a Monica-Rachel-Phoebe and start a bonfire, but at least put all the stuff away in a box so you won't look every damn day. 4. Stop feeling sorry for yourself \nYes, it hurts (you are human after all), and while it's okay to disappear under the blanket and not emerge for days, at some point you need to stop feeling sorry for yourself and understand that you are a strong, independent person who can survive no matter what. 5. Stop holding it all in \nIt's okay to have a bitch-session and just let it all out. Let your close friend know about everything that went wrong and vent out all that bottled hurt and anger. Trust us, that can work wonders. Gifs via Tumblr / Giphy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:09:51.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
