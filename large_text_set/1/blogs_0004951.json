But despite her shaky start in life, mum says she is a lively one-year-old. \nHer dramatic birth has seemingly had no ill effects, and she is perfectly healthy. \nSydney was diagnosed with the ultra-rare condition at her beautician mum’s 12-week scan, at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex. \nIt came as a shock, as the majority of newborns’ intestines have moved inside their abdomen by 11 weeks’ gestation, after initially developing outside the umbilical cord. \n“I really didn’t expect it,” Fran said. “I was with my husband Paul, now 45, and suddenly the consultant noticed something amiss.” \nFrom then on, Fran’s care throughout her pregnancy was transferred to The Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel – miles away from their home in Harlow.

But Fran had ultrasounds every four weeks, to check Sydney’s progress, and learnt at her 16-week scan, that only her baby’s bowels were exposed. \nFran continued: “It was scary to be told at my first scan that something wasn’t right. \n“It was the last thing that we expected. \n“We were told our baby was just one in 3,000 babies who would be born with this condition, and we had so many concerns.” \nFran and Paul, an accounts assistant and part-time mobile DJ, were told the pregnancy could not progress beyond 37 weeks, as it would not be safe for Sydney.

Her bowel was wrapped tightly to her body, with what looked like a special version of Clingfilm, which would help protect it. \n“She was then placed into an incubator and, before she was rushed off, we were lucky enough to be able to see her, take our first photos, and touch her. \n\"These were all things we didn’t think would be possible, so we were completely and utterly overwhelmed.” Read More Fran and Paul following the birth of their little girl on 5 January 2016 (Photo: PA Real Life) \nFran wasn’t shocked by her girl’s appearance. \n“A friend of a friend had a baby who’d suffered the same thing,” she explained. “She’d shown me pictures, so I knew what Sydney would look like. \n“But we knew once she was born she had a huge battle on her hands. \n“We didn’t know how long it would take her to get better.” \nThe couple stayed in The Stevenson House – special family accommodation just minutes away - courtesy of The Sick Children’s Trust, enabling them to visit Sydney constantly. \nOver the next few days the ‘Clingfilm’ – actually a silo bag – was reduced in size.
