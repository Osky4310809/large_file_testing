Scott Gardner said:\n\"It's not unusual for them to get into those dances where they chase each other around.\"\nHmm.. we prefer Jonathan's theory that the birds are just trying to give the cat a 10th life.\n[ Image via Twitter . ] \nTags: natural wonder , tacky and true , twitter , viral: animals , wacky", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:32:27.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
