These awards recognize the magazine Editor-in-Chief Bill Panoff’s “favorite travel experiences” that left “amazing impressions in terms of service, quality, and memorable moments.”\n\nWe’re honored that Remy was among his favorite experiences last year! \nRemy offers the most luxurious dining onboard Disney Cruise Line ships exclusively for our adult guests and serves the finest French fare. Named after the tiny star and master chef of the Disney•Pixar film “ Ratatouille ,” Remy transports guests to an authentic fine-dining restaurant in the City of Lights. The elegant dining room is softly lit and designed in a timeless Art Nouveau style with tasteful nods to the film, including artful appearances of Remy.\nThe gourmet selection was masterfully crafted by Chef Arnaud Lallement of l’Assiette Champenoise—a Michelin 3-star restaurant just outside Reims, France—and Chef Scott Hunnel from award-winning Victoria & Albert’s at Walt Disney World Resort . The menu features decadent offerings such as smoked bison with fennel and blood oranges from Chef Scott Hunnel and langoustines royale (Norway Lobster with Caesar sauce) from Chef Arnaud Lallement.\nRemy is truly a culinary adventure like no other.
