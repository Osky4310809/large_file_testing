By Wesley Yin-Poole Published 07/03/2017 \nSurvival horror game Outlast 2 comes out on 28th April on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. \nWarner Bros. has signed a deal to release Outlast Trinity, a physical bundle that includes Outlast 2, Outlast and the Outlast Whistleblower DLC. \nOutlast 2 is set in the same universe as 2013's Outlast, but with different characters and a different setting. Here's the official blurb: Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with his wife Lynn, must take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch. As the two follow a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe, the investigation leads them miles into the Arizona desert to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do. \nThe Outlast Whistleblower DLC tells the story before and after the events of Outlast to show the final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story. You play Waylon Park, a software engineer under contract with Murkoff.
