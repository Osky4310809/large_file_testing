Because he's now turning to a BDSM expert.\nIn the midst of getting completely owned in his ongoing Twitter battle with Harry Potter author and unrivaled Twitter queen J.K. Rowling , Morgan attempted to turn to another famous author for a moment of relief: 50 Shades of Grey mastermind E.L. James .\nSEE ALSO: Piers Morgan simply does not realize J.K. Rowling masterfully subtweeted him\nHi @E_L_James , any chance you could start tweeting me one of your books? I need some relief from this Harry Potter crap.\n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 15, 2017\nUnfortunately for Morgan (and fortunately for pretty much everyone else), he walked right into another epic roasting at the hands of a Potter fan.\nJames responded to the TV personality with an unattributed Quote: .\n@piersmorgan 'I believed that the more exposure I got in the press, the better my career would progress. Trouble was, I became overexposed'\n— E L James (@E_L_James) February 15, 2017\nThe tweet standing alone is a pretty good burn on Morgan, obviously insinuating his battle with Rowling is a desperate quest for attention. But who said it?\nWith the follow-up tweet, James dropped the hammer.\n@piersmorgan Gilderoy Lockhart, from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n— E L James (@E_L_James) February 15, 2017\nIt. Was. From. Harry. Potter.\nThe Quote: was pulled from a conversation between Lockhart, a famous wizarding celebrity , and Harry Potter in the second book of the series.\nOf course, Potter fans loved this perfect interaction.\n@E_L_James @piersmorgan E L James just won the Internet for today.\n— Shammoz #WithWine™ (@Shammoz) February 16, 2017\n@E_L_James pic.twitter.com/G12IcoIIv2\n— Jeanna Skinner (@JeannaLStars) February 16, 2017\n@E_L_James @piersmorgan You. Are. Amazing!!!\n— Fiona P (@mooreridge) February 15, 2017\nWho's next in line to ether Morgan? We can't wait to see.\nBONUS: J.K.
