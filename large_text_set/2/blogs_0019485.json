But it's nothing compared to Los Angeles drivers, who were stuck in gridlock a whopping 104.1 hours, which topped Inrix's list. \n\"I would feel reasonably good about where you're at,\" said Aaron Renn, who specializes in urban policy for the Manhattan Institute, a think tank. \"I wouldn't feel great, but it doesn't strike me in terms of traffic.\" \nHouston often ranks worse than Dallas when it comes to traffic, but not this time. It was 24th on the list, followed by Austin, at 32. San Antonio barely made the top 100, at 95. \nRenn compared the bulging population in Dallas-Fort Worth with New York City's low rate of growth. \n\"When you're adding over a million people every decade, traffic is going to be bad because of a lack of infrastructure,\" he said. \"You're going to need to build more roads.\" \nThat's precisely the plan, said Michael Morris, director of transportation for the North Central Texas Council of Governments. He noted that Dallas-Fort Worth is the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the country, so being ranked seventh is positive. \n\"The good news is we're doing the right projects,\" Morris said. \"The bad news is we're scored down because of congestion and we have more areas under construction compared to other parts of the country.\" \nIn the survey, the boundaries of Dallas-Fort Worth stretch from Fort Worth out west to Terrell in the east and from McKinney in the north to Mansfield and DeSoto in the south. \nMorris anticipates Dallas will be ranked in a better spot when upcoming construction projects wrap up within the next eight to 10 years. \nBut that means traffic may get worse before it gets better. \nThe Texas Department of Transportation has earmarked $786 million in funds for Dallas as part of Gov. Greg Abbott's Texas Clear Lanes initiative . \nThe plan aims to reduce congestion, improve mobility and enhance efficiency along Interstate 35E from Interstate 30 to Oak Lawn and I-35E from U.S. Highway 67, called the Southern Gateway. \nAlso included in the Clear Lanes initiative is $265.3 million for three major projects in Fort Worth. \n\"These are short-term delays with 50 years of benefit,\" Morris said. Highway gridlock is galling, and TxDOT plans to fix some of it in Dallas \nDallas drivers could use the relief, both in terms of saving time and money. \nSitting in congestion costs each Dallas-Fort Worth driver $1,508 and costs the cities $2.9 billion, according to the survey. That price tag includes cost of time, wear and tear on the roads, fuel cost and the social cost of emissions. \nThe ranking came as no surprise to Victor Vandergriff, commissioner with the Texas Transportation Commission, especially considering Dallas-Fort Worth's population growth and projections for the future. \n\"It's a never-ending battle to keep up with congestion,\" Vandergriff said. \"We will have to be ever more creative in moving people through.\" \nVandergriff believes Dallas has the opportunity to set an example for other big cities and expects Abbott's Clear Lanes initiative to spur economic development through road and infrastructure investments. \n\"We are a region with a lot of resources, and I feel good about our chances to dig out of the hole and keep it moving forward compared to other [cities] in the country,\" Vandergriff said. \nDallas City Council member Lee Kleinman sees several solutions to move forward: expanding DART and its streetcar lines and making bicycle and walkability improvements. \nHe said creating \"urban node\" areas, such as the Oak Cliff Gateway project, would allow residents to work, live and play with less reliance on vehicles. \n\"People need to start figuring out how to live closer to where they need to go,\" Kleinman said. \"In southern Dallas, many people have to commute to get to jobs, if we could figure out how to get more job opportunities in southern Dallas, they wouldn't have to drive so far.\" \nWith the population expected to double in the next 50 years, he admitted it could be a bumpy road ahead. \n\"It's going to be tough,\" he said. \"It's scary.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:52:40.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
