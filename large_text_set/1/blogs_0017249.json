Wildcats have been the tougher team -- and hitting 3's at a ridiculous rate doesn't hurt. 1/21/2017, 9:58:34 PM Arizona carried the momentum into the second half and led by as many as 13 in the early going, but the Bruins began to turn the tide and cut into the Wildcats' advantage. With Arizona leading 66-55, UCLA went on a 7-0 run, including five points from Ball, to whittle the deficit to just four. Senior guard Isaac Hamilton later nailed a trey with 11:31 left to get the Bruins to within two and wake up the home crowd: UCLA Basketball @UCLAMBB 1/21/2017, 10:39:34 PM Rawle Alkins answered with a three of his own for the Wildcats to temporarily curtail the UCLA run. Trier then stretched Arizona's lead back to seven with an explosive dunk that reminded Wildcats fans of what they had been missing in the season's opening months: CBS Sports CBB @CBSSportsCBB 1/21/2017, 10:44:37 PM UCLA never managed to get closer than the two-point deficit it faced near the 11-minute mark, as Arizona's scoring depth took over and kept the lead out of reach. The Wildcats are undefeated since losing to Gonzaga in early December, and based on the way they played Saturday with Trier back in the fold, they look the part of a national title contender. Provided they can win their next three games against unranked opponents, a Feb. 4 meeting with No. 11 Oregon looms in a game that may be for the Pac -12 lead. Although UCLA faltered, it also has a three-game stretch against unranked teams before a Feb. 9 rematch with an Oregon team that beat it by just two points. The Bruins have plenty to work on both offensively and defensively, but many of their struggles Saturday can be chalked up to Arizona playing a nearly perfect game. Postgame Reaction Following a game that saw several players turn in major contributions for the Wildcats, much of the focus was predictably on Trier's return. The sophomore made a big impact at both ends of the floor, and Arizona head coach Sean Miller expressed his belief that Trier put the Wildcats over the top in Saturday's game, according to Clay Fowler of the Los Angeles Daily News : Clay Fowler @Clay_Fowler #Arizona coach Sean Miller on the return of Allonzo Trier from PED suspension for 96-85 win at #UCLA: \"I don't think we win without him.\" 1/22/2017, 12:01:27 AM UCLA head coach Steve Alford agreed that Trier was a big-time difference-maker, and he was highly impressed with Arizona as a team, per Scott Gleeson of USA Today : \"That obviously was a big boost for them and [Trier's] a very, very good player. He helped impact their team in a very positive way. They're an outstanding basketball team. They've yet to lose on the road so it speaks highly to what they are as a team. In film they look good. In person, they look even better.\" According to Liz Habib of Fox 11 in Los Angeles, Ball made it clear after the game that the Bruins need to step up defensively moving forward: Liz Habib @LizHabib", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:44:24.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
