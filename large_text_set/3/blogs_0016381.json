Become a master Pokémon GO player Super Mario Run for Android Official Launch Date \nWe finally have the official launch date for Super Mario Run on Android: March 23! When the hit game arrives on Android, it will be version 2.0.0 - which means more playable characters. And, if you complete a particular Bowser challenge in the free version, it's possible for you to unlock World 1-4 (even though only three levels are available for the free version). Android version of #SuperMarioRun   3/23 with the Ver.2.0.0 update! Pre-register now: https://t.co/dAxzTlppnG pic.twitter.com/nQ0T4znOBt — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) March 18, 2017 \nIt is possible to pre-register to get on the waiting list , so you can be one of the first to download the game. Like the iOS game, it will be free to download, but you will have to pay if you want to play beyond the first few levels. Then it will cost you $9.99 to unlock the whole game. Why did Super Mario Run take so long to come to Android? \nOriginally released exclusively for iPhone and iPad, Super Mario Run was immediately a smash hit. Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's creator, explained to Fortune that the reason why the game was taking so long to reach Android users was due to the platform's fragmentation. Opinion by Brittany McGhee It's a shame Android users have to wait so much longer than iOS users What do you think? 50 2 participants \nMiyamoto said, “One of the reasons we focused on iPhone first was the stability of the platform and being able to get the level of response that we want out of the games. And that’s not to say that Android devices don’t have the same level of responsiveness. But because there are so many Android devices, trying to engineer the game to work across them all requires quite a lot of time.” Android users weren't getting left behind, they just needed to wait a bit longer. \nWhile you wait for the game to be officially released, I would caution you against the temptation to download any APKs you may find on the internet. They are all viruses and malware for the moment, and you don't want that. \nAre you looking forward to the game? Have you tried it on iOS yet? Let us know what you think. 98 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T13:31:34.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
