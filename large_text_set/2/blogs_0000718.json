I pay more than others, much more than others. \n\"For example, yesterday one manager was told by an official 'I love your emotion'. \n\"Today [Wednesday] I was told to sit down or I have to go to the stands. On the pitch was the same. I don't want to speak much because I don't want to pay fines. \n\"They [match officials] don't like my emotion. I think what happens this season [Mourinho's fines] is not for me to say.\" \nMourinho storms out of TV interview \nMourinho had previously had a veiled swipe at Klopp in comments made after his side reached the final of the EFL Cup, insisting the wind at Wembley stadium meant they are not favourites against Southampton. \nThat was after former Dortmund boss Klopp had himself appeared to blame the blustery conditions at Anfield as part of the reason his side were dumped out of the competition by the Saints. \nThe result on Wednesday night means United are now four points behind fifth-placed Manchester City in the table, where all three points against Hull would have seen them just three behind Tottenham in second.
