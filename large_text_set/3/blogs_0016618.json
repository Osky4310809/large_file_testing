I am a Parent, Community Member and Neighbor to St. Helen's who cares about our people, our children and the economic impact of our community in south east Fresno. Most recently St Helen's School has been beautifully renovated and is about to be shut down at the end of the 2017 school year. I am seeking your support as Neighbors, Citizens and Parents to let the Diocese of Fresno and Bishop Armando Ochoa know we are in support of keeping the school open due to the following points regarding what Vacant properties can cause in a Community such as South East Fresno. The Community has been able to gather several letters of political support and your Voice will help! In the event you have time and can contribute a letter of support, this would be wonderful, otherwise, just respond I agree Vacant and Abandoned property can potentially cause the following: 1. Blight in the Neighboring Community 2. Increased Crime (especially Arson) 3. Plunging Property Values which leads to less Tax Revenue 4. Negative Economic Impact/Devaluation to Neighboring Businesses 5. Source of Disinvestment for the Surrounding Community 6. Leaves the Municipality in charge of the property unless the owner can maintain it 7. Increased Risk to the Health and Welfare of the neighboring community Thank you in advance for your time and support!
