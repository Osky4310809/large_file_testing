President Donald Trump signed an executive action to establish new vetting procedures for… more Olivier Douliery | Bloomberg The ruling is a result of a lawsuit filed by Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson . Washington was the first state to challenge the order in court, and did so with the support of Seattle-area tech companies Amazon and Expedia. RELATED: Seattle attorney Noah Guzzo Purcell takes on Trump over immigration “No one is above the law, not even the President,” Ferguson said in a statement after the ruling. “The president should withdraw this flawed, rushed and dangerous Executive Order, which caused chaos across the country. If he refuses, I will continue our work to hold him accountable to the Constitution.” A federal judge in Seattle on Friday halted Trump’s 90-day ban on admissions and re-entry into the U.S. for non-citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen. Trump's directive imposed a 120-day ban for refugees and an indefinite ban for Syrian refugees. The Trump administration argued the temporary restraining order should be reversed, but appeals court judges ruled the hold will remain while the larger case plays out in court. Many Seattle-area politicians and business leaders condemned Trump's immigration order. Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) said the order puts employees at risk . Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) considered putting job candidates blocked by the order in offices outside the U.S. Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) plans to hire 10,000 refugees in response . Expedia said the ruling could cost the company 1,000 customer sales . T-Mobile (Nasdaq: TMUS) was notably silent . Washington and the 15 other states who have challenged the ban argue the order violates the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause by discriminating based on religion and national origin and the First Amendment's Establishment Clause because it shows a clear government preference for one specific religion over others. RELATED: Seattle attorneys who rushed to Sea-Tac after immigration ban anticipate more orders, more demand for services Before his election, Trump called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims \" into the U.S. and in explaining the order said he wants to stop immigrants from predominantly Muslim nations because he claims they are a terror risk. The order does not include Saudi Arabia or other countries of origin for the Sept. 11 hijackers. It also does not include predominantly Muslim countries where Trump has hotels or similar business interests. The San Francisco case was heard by Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush; Judge William C. Canby Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter; and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama RELATED: Microsoft wants an exception to Trump's travel ban. Here's how it would work. Nearly 100 companies including Microsoft , Google, Facebook and Apple filed a legal brief challenging Trump's temporary travel ban on Sunday, arguing the order hurts business and violates the Constitution. “The tremendous impact of immigrants on America — and on American business — is not happenstance,” the companies wrote in the brief , filed with the same court. “People who choose to leave everything that is familiar and journey to an unknown land to make a new life necessarily are endowed with drive, creativity, determination — and just plain guts. The energy they bring to America is a key reason why the American economy has been the greatest engine of prosperity and innovation in history.” Riley McDermid at the San Francisco Business Times contributed to this report.
