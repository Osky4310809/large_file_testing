Edelman and Roethlisberger Get Into It over AssholeGate Jerry Thornton | \n— SNF on NBC (@SNFonNBC) January 18, 2017 \n. \nPFT – Patriots receiver Julian Edelman derided the Steelers after Antonio Brown turned Pittsburgh’s postgame locker room into a Facebook Live session, saying, “That’s how that team is run.” Ben Roethlisberger disagreed. \nAsked today about Edelman’s comments, Roethlisberger said the Steelers’ six Vince Lombardi Trophies show how their franchise is run. \n“I don’t think I need to speak much,” Roethlisberger answered when asked what he’d say to Edelman. “We’ve got our trophies out there. I’ve got owners that I think are the best in the business. They’re family to us, and I’m sure if he talked to his owner, he would say the same thing about the Rooneys. Anybody in here in the football world or the regular world that owns the Rooneys knows what they stand for. It’s a blessing to call them a family.” \nThe bad news here is that Edelman’s full answer to the question about AssholeGate tamer than it sounds. He went on WEEI and said “Hey, people have different rules. That’s how that team is run. I personally don’t think that would be something that would happen in our locker room. But, hey, whatever. Some people like red and some people like blue. Some people like tulips and some people like roses, whatever.” Basically saying it doesn’t matter, which is a damned sight different than “What do you expect from that classless collection of shitheads? That’s how they roll,” the way it reads out of context. \nThe good news is, Edelman’s words are being twisted to generate bad blood and that is a pure good. Some of your best wars are fought over complete misunderstandings. The Confederates could have won at Gettysburg if General Ewell understood Lee’s orders to take Cemetery Hill “if practicable” meant “Get your ass in gear and do it now.” World War I was over nothing but a bunch of treaty entanglements between old monarchies. The Russian Revolution was started by Lenin, but he was sent to Moscow by the Germans to cause trouble just so the Russians would get off their backs in WWI. \nSo oceans of blood have been spilled over less than the Steelers thinking Edelman was putting them on blast when he really wasn’t. And that’s good for all of us. Genuine hatred always makes football better and is in way too short supply in Roger Goodell’s corporate NFL. I hope the Steelers take this quote and run with and obsess over it all week and the Patriots do the same. Because when there’s sincere, mutual disgust that turns a playoff game into a knife fight, America wins.
