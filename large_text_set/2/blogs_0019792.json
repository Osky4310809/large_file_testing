By Angela Fritz By Angela Fritz February 22 at 11:32 AM Follow @angelafritz Cherry blossoms are blooming in the D.C. region. Peak bloom at the Tidal Basin is still a few weeks away. (Chris Fukuda) \nWhereâ€™s the snow? Why is it 70 degrees? Yada yada yada â€” we didnâ€™t have a winter. I donâ€™t want to talk about it. Instead, letâ€™s enjoy the spring transpiring before our eyes. \nThe frogs, they think itâ€™s time to start mating! In the 10 minutes I spent researching frog and toad calls â€” fascinating â€” Iâ€™m pretty confident these are mostly wood frogs (but if Iâ€™m wrong, Iâ€™m sure I will hear about it in the comments!). \nWood frogs donâ€™t just hibernate, they freeze. During the winter, 60 percent to 70 percent of a wood frogâ€™s bodily fluids are frozen, according to the Department of Biology at Pennsylvania State University. When the temperature rises, the frogs thaw, their hearts begin to beat again and they get down to the business of mating. \nWood frogs hang out in mating pools that are usually* made of melt water from the snowy season, rather than ponds and creeks that may have egg-eating predators. The guys call out to the gals in croaks that kind of sound like duck quacks. When a lucky lady finds a croak she can live with, they fertilize their eggs in the pools of shallow water. \nThat process was already in action on Feb. 20, documented by Nate Handy and a skeptical pup in Great Falls National Park. @capitalweather I have no idea when the spring frogs are supposed to be doing this, but it seemed early @Gr8FallsPark today. pic.twitter.com/BmbJL6ZH7k \nâ€” Nate Handy (@capthandy) February 21, 2017 \n*The D.C. region hasnâ€™t just been snowless, itâ€™s also been really dry. Iâ€™m a little concerned these poor frogs wonâ€™t have a lot of pools to lay their eggs this season. \nAnd the flowers â€” so many flowers! The early-blooming cherry blossom trees are in peak performance this week. Arlington, in particular, has a lot of these species. Across the Potomac, there tend to be more of the traditionally worshiped Yoshino variety, which were originally planted by first lady Helen Taft and the wife of the Japanese ambassador, Iwa Chinda, in 1912. Those trees wonâ€™t come into bloom for another few weeks, and weâ€™ll have a peak bloom forecast for the Tidal Basin on Thursday or Friday. It's not even March yet and already ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ blossoms are popping everywhere! @capitalweather @ABC7News @ABC7EileenW @amelia_draper pic.twitter.com/iVdGn5jZWI \nâ€” Chris Fukuda (@chris_fukuda) February 22, 2017 Early bloomers near the WWI Memorial.
