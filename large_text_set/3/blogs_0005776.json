Like in other countries, Android Pay in Belgium is rather straight forward, working wherever contactless payments are accepted and allowing you to pay for items using just your phone.\nIn its blog post , Google says that over 85,000 retail locations throughout Belgium will support Android Pay, including major retail brands such as H&M, Media Markt and Carrefour, as well as smaller retailers and independent stores.\nThe rollout of Android Pay isnâ€™t just limited to physical retail stores, as Google has teamed up with some popular apps to allow you to check out using Android Pay directly from within the app. Some of the apps support Android Pay at launch include HotelTonight, Deliveroo, Vueling and TransferWise with apps like Uber cited as coming soon.\nFor Belgian users, the banks currently supporting Android Pay are BNP Paribas, Fintro and Hello bank! while CBC, KBC and KBC Brussels are all expected to offer support in the near future.
