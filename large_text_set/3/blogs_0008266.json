It was while studying in Nottingham, UK, in 2013 that Karishma chanced upon the Humans Of New York Facebook page, run by Brandon Stanton. She was not only inspired by the spectacular pictures and inspiring stories, but immediately checked to see if such an initiative existed in her home city of Mumbai. As it did not, that's where the seed of Humans Of Bombay came to her mind. It was the perfect opportunity to tell stories (like she wanted), and that too of the people who really make the city that is Mumbai. \"I've been a tour guide, worked in a big company, started my own flour business...but I love driving a taxi more than anything else. My business is still running, but driving a cab gives me the freedom to live many lives in one day -- I always make it a point to chat with my customers and find out things about the world that I wouldn't have otherwise. My biggest pride is my family -- they live in my hometown. I love my wife who's made sure that our children are on the right path in my absence, and who took care of everything at home while I had to work. Just this Karvachauth I surprised her with her favorite halwa-- you should have seen her face, she was so happy. My son is pursuing BSC-It and has big dreams, but my daughters who are both in school have even bigger dreams. One wants to get an MBA and the other wants to be a PHD...I don't even know what those things are but I'm working hard so that they can study as far as they can and achieve everything they want. I barely sleep 5 hours a night because I'm chasing that dream and working...but I love every minute of it!\" A post shared by Humans of Bombay (@officialhumansofbombay) on Jan 16, 2017 at 8:49pm PST \nOne Sunday morning, in 2014, Karishma made a Facebook page and a logo on Microsoft Word, and embarked on the journey that is now, three years later, an extremely successful Facebook page, website, and coffee-table book of the same name. Karishma had no formal training in photography, and the first time she tried to talk to someone on the street, she was rejected ten times, until one woman agreed to be photographed and shared her story. She has, since, collected over a 1000 stories, but what really means the most to her is the impact that the stories have made. \"I come here during the evening to sell bubble sticks. I have amazing parents, who encourage me to go to school but I know that they're struggling to make ends meet -- so with the money I make here, I try to buy things for school and contribute to my fees.\" \"What is your happiest memory?\" \"I'm so happy everyday -- I love going to school and studying, I love my parents, I love my job-- who else can say that they're work is to make bubbles and make other children happy? I love everything in my life, so I'm happy also all the time!\" A post shared by Humans of Bombay (@officialhumansofbombay) on Nov 10, 2016 at 8:39am PST \nPeople have shared immensely personal stories with her - from their troubled marriages, to homosexuality, abuse, parenthood, love, relationships, illness, and loss. Bringing awareness to these stories has not only changed the lives of the people in question, but have even impacted us all, and given more people the platform to come out about their stories and experiences. Although it might have been inspired by the already existent Humans Of New York page, Humans Of Bombay has its own identity. It shows struggles of people living in adversity, and how they have dealt with their lives. \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" \"My only friend in the world is a dog who lives on the pavement near by. So many times at night he comes and sleeps next to me, he protects me from the older bullies and we often share whatever food I get. When I grow up, I want to be him.\" A post shared by Humans of Bombay (@officialhumansofbombay) on Jan 7, 2017 at 9:39pm PST \nThrough the page, Karishma has even managed to raise large amounts of money for various causes - like the empowerment of sex workers and acid attack victims. Karishma remembers each and every story she has been told. And, to her, being able to share these stories and make an impact on people's lives keeps her going. She makes no money or profits from the page, and that was never her intention. It remains a passion project for her, and she hopes more people continue to share their stories, and realise that sharing can actually help. Karishma is dedicated to putting people's stories out there, empowering them, and showing us what the city of Bombay is really made of, and we can't wait to see what she does in the future.
