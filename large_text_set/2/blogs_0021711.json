Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLabour's Deputy Leader Tom Watson has received massive cash donations worth £500,000 from Max Mosley over the past year, new figures show. \nOfficial records published by the House of Commons revealed Mr Watson has this month taken £300,000 from the former motor racing boss - paid via the Labour Party - to support his office as Deputy Leader. \nIt follows a similar donation from Mr Mosley to Mr Watson worth £200,000 registered last June. \nMr Watson said: “I’m proud to call Max Mosley a friend and I’m delighted he has made a financial contribution to Labour. \n“His generous donation will help the party develop strong policies for our next manifesto.” \nSources close to Mr Watson said the cash will be used to fund new staff members for the Deputy Leader’s office to help develop Labour policies ahead of the next general election. Max Mosley has donated £500,000 to Tom Watson (Photo: PA) \nHowever the donations will be highly controversial as Mr Watson is also Labour’s shadow culture secretary, whose brief includes press regulation. \nAnd Mr Mosley is the main financial backer of the Impress press regulator, which was set up in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics. \nThe Independent Press Regulation Trust agreed to a £3.8 million four-year funding deal for Impress. and said this money had been guaranteed by the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust. \nThis was set up by Mr Mosley, a victim of a newspaper sting involving images of him at a sex party, with Impress also receiving a “generous” donation from writer JK Rowling. \nMr Watson has previously been highly critical of the press and has demanded the Leveson Inquiry findings be implemented in full. \nIn a speech in 2014 he said of press owners: “They don’t want fairness, they don’t want change. No catalogue of the wrongdoing they have overseen would be long enough to shame them. They want business as usual.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:40:24.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
