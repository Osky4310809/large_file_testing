This was the ninth successful rocket landing for SpaceX. \n\"We just had an incredible day today,\" Musk said during a live broadcast of the launch. \"The first reflight of an orbital class booster did its mission perfectly, dropped off the second stage, came back and landed on the drone ship, right in the bullseye. It is an amazing day I think for space as a whole for the space industry. It means you can fly and refly an orbit-class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket.\"\n\nWe still need to wait and see if the communications satellite successfully deploys before we know if this mission went off without a hitch, but right now, things are looking good. \nThis launch and landing marks a huge moment for SpaceX's business model and the private spaceflight industry as a whole. \nAll of the company's plans for the future — including its big ambitions to fly humans to Mars one day — depend on driving down the cost of spaceflight by reusing rocket boosters for multiple launches. \n\"If they're successful, it proves that they are able to reuse a rocket which is going to significantly lower their cost, which will allow them to be even more competitive than they are now,\" Bill Ostrove, an aerospace and defense industry analyst at Forecast International, said in an interview before launch. \nFalcon 9 first stage has landed on Of Course I Still Love You — world’s first reflight of an orbital class rocket.\n— SpaceX (@SpaceX) March 30, 2017 \nTraditionally, rocket bodies are discarded after one use, but SpaceX has figured out a way to bring them back to Earth and refurbish them to fly multiple missions. \nBy flying these rockets multiple times — and eventually only paying to refuel the boosters — Musk thinks his company can greatly drive down the cost of launching payloads and one day people to orbit. \n\nThe rocket stage standing on the drone ship.\nImage: spacex\nA Falcon 9 rocket costs about $62 million total, but fuel is just a relatively small portion of that.\n\"If one can figure out how to effectively reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred,\" Musk has said . \"A fully reusable vehicle has never been done before. That really is the fundamental breakthrough needed to revolutionize access to space.\"\n\nIn the time since this rocket's first flight in April 2016, SpaceX has refurbished and tested the booster, making sure that it was okay to fly another mission.\nThis nearly year-long turnaround time isn't ideal. Eventually, SpaceX wants to figure out a quick way of turning boosters around and flying them again without much time sitting on the ground. \nOther companies are also aiming for reusability. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has landed its suborbital New Shepard rocket five times after five launches, and it plans to make its not-yet-built heavy lift rockets reusable in the future as well. \nWATCH: Relive SpaceX's incredible daytime rocket landing with this video", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:01:06.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
