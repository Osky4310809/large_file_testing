Right now, we’re super confused over here, because Kylie Jenner just quit her app. Why? According to Refinery29, Kylie Jenner quit her app because of a post about sex. Some personal info about her relationship was posted, and she’s less than pleased.\nSo what, exactly, caused Kylie Jenner to quit her app? She took to Twitter to explain. Hey guys from now on I won't be posting personally on my app anymore...\n— Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) January 3, 2017 a post went up today quoting something that I NEVER EVER said or saw. A very personal post that I would never ever approve.\n— Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) January 3, 2017 And it's unfair to me and you to think that those were my words.I'm sorry and I know we will figure somethng out so we can all be satisfied\n— Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) January 3, 2017 From what we can gather, the issue is that the post implies she and boyfriend Tyga are having sex , and like, we guess we can see why she’d be irritated that this was posted without her permission. Out of respect for Kylie, we’re not going to share the original post, considering that it was enough for her to shut down posting on her app.\nA photo posted by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Dec 10, 2016 at 12:35am PST \nAnd seriously, who are we to judge? Her past actions may seem ~scandalous~ or whatever, but that doesn’t mean her entire life is our business. While we might not all understand why she was so upset by the post, she was, and that’s all that really matters.\nWhatever her reasoning, Kylie Jenner just quit her app, but still sends love. Love You\n— Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) January 3, 2017 We heart you t0o, girl.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:14:48.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
