(Reuters) \nLive Score, India vs Australia 2nd Test: When Australia finished Day 1 at 40/0 after dismissing India for just 189 runs in the first innings, most people had written off the home side. However, 2nd day of the Bangalore Test showed a different side of the Indian cricket team. There was hunger, there was belief and of course, there was sweat. Even though the visitors finished the day with a lead of 48 runs and still have 4 wickets in hand, Indian bowlers ensured that the opposition doesn’t run away with the game. Ravichandran Ashwin went back in the hut having conceded just 75 runs from his 41 overs while Ravindra Jadeja picked ended up picking 3 wickets despite bowling just 17 overs. \nHowever, the stars for India were fast bowlers Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav. Ishant gave away two boundaries in his first 10 balls of the day but in his next 98 balls, only one reached the fence and that too of an outside edge. He finished with the figures of 39/1 from 23 and Umesh ended with 57/1 from 24 overs. In every over, a ball kept low, an outside edge was missed, a glorious drive was played and there was some sign of aggression from either the batsmen or the bowler. \nCredit goes to young Aussie opener Matt Renshaw who scored his third Test half-century and nullified the Indian bowling attack. He was solid throughout the day and proved why he is ranked so high in Australia’s cricketing circuit despite being only 20-year-old. Shaun Marsh too justified his selection ahead of Usman Khawaja by scoring a hard-fought half-century. India would like to keep Australia’s lead to below 100 and anything above that can make comeback very tough for Virat Kohli ’s side on this pitch. \nHere are Live Cricket Score updates of India vs Australia 2nd Test: \nPlaying Conditions: \nThe pitch at Bangalore surprised everyone with its turn and bounce. On Day 2, some balls kept low but none of the Indian spinners could extract the same amount of turn as Nathan Lyon did on Day 1. Things won’t get any better on Day 3 and scoring rate will remain on the lower side. Batsmen will to fight hard for their runs and patience will be the key once again. \nTeams: \nIndia – Abhinav Mukund, Lokesh Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Karun Nair, Wriddhiman Saha, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav. \nAustralia – David Warner, Matt Renshaw, Steven Smith, Shaun Marsh, Peter Handscomb, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Steve O’Keefe, Nathan Lyon. \n7:20 AM: “If we can get them out for another 25, 30 or 40 runs, it will be great. We will focus on bowling right line and length and wickets will come. I think there is enough help from the pitch for the spinners and fast bowlers. So if we continue to bowl the way we have bowled and the bowlers will have some plans tomorrow for Starc and the other batsman. We will think of what we could have done better but overall I feel we have bowled well,” said Cheteshwar Pujara at the end of Day 2 \n7:40 AM: Matt Renshaw has been very impressive on this tour so far and will return home as a much improved player. In fact, only one Australian under the age of 21 has made a Test 50 in Asia – Matt Renshaw who has now managed two! \n8:00 AM: “It was a really good day for us. Challenge was to bat full day and we did that pretty well. The Indian fast bowlers bowled quite well and didn’t give us much. Just a tough grind. We did a lot of work before the series and it is paying dividends for the bowlers and the batsmen. Hopefully, we have a couple of good days and retain the series,” said a confident Matt Renshaw after stumps.
