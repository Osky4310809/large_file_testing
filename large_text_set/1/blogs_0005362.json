Residents use more coal-fired power to heat their frigid homes, filling the skies with small breathable particles — called particulate matter — that can damage people's lungs and hearts.\nLarge swaths of China's north were enshrouded in smog in mid-December , prompting officials to order hundreds of factories and schools to close.

Regulators are also starting to crack down on pollution from the mammoth manufacturing sector.\n\"It's hard to remember when the scenes outside your window look like something out of Mad Max , but the situation is improving,\" Zhang Kai, a climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace, wrote in a Dec. 20 blog post .\nBONUS: Scientist Wants to Wash Beijing’s Smog Away", "external_links": ["https://t.co/JJbKq4Ixdn", "http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/aqirecent3.html", "http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/X1u5Xe1Y.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/X1u5Xe1Y.m3u8", "http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2058582/smog-levels-beijing-charts", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mnjmEr_n6aojNBnq3xQQ8vTcWIo=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F333619%2F2b89eaa7-a770-40ed-9ef2-5126258a5cd5.jpg", "https://t.co/CZDNEeoaXT", "http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-pollution-idUKKBN14L0TR", "http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/news/blog/460-million-people-in-china-are-choking-under/blog/58343/", "https://twitter.com/ChinaAirQuality/status/815264185336532993", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-TeRUsUKbl_TLO9TsgmNGmqgGpg=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F333593%2Ff2a5e0e1-29fa-4676-9ed5-3f83744d2c78.png", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/airquality?src=hash", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9HORwLk7A6WpULuux3JqDuco42U=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F333619%2F2b89eaa7-a770-40ed-9ef2-5126258a5cd5.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KursqdfYGQu0kEbgpVVEcvpAULc=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F333593%2Ff2a5e0e1-29fa-4676-9ed5-3f83744d2c78.png"], "published": "2017-01-02T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T00:24:47.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
