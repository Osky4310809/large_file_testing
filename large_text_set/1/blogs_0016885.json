The night ended in a dazzling red, white and blue firework display and it was an extremely patriotic moment. \nThe scene was much uglier on the other side of town. \nThe DeploraBall, an event for Trump supporters to celebrate his inauguration, was about to begin at the National Press Club, when protesters assembled to try and block the entrance. When the DeploraBall guests started showing up, the demonstrators had some choice names for them. The crowd jeers at people entering the DeploraBall. Earlier, they chanted, \"Nazi scum, off our streets!\" pic.twitter.com/g5QNHCH313 — Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) January 20, 2017 \nIn others videos posted online, you can hear the protesters chanting \"No KKK, Fascist USA!\" and throwing water bottles at the ticket holders. People leaving Deploraball have water bottles thrown at them and followed by people shouting \"Nazi Scum.\" pic.twitter.com/x2SLvDeq8h — Hailey Branson-Potts (@haileybranson) January 20, 2017 \nOther demonstrators set fires outside the venue and others were reportedly getting violent with police, resulting in the latter having to use pepper spray. \nUnfortunately, this is probably just a preview of what we'll see tomorrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T13:05:42.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
