(YouTube) Two porn stars have offered blowjobs to all of their Twitter followers if the New England Patriots win the Super Bowl this Sunday.\nCarmen Valentina and Lauren Phillips, who have over 400,000 Twitter followers between them, initially picked four teams to win the Super Bowl with the promise that they would give oral sex to strangers if any one of those sides went on to lift the trophy.\nAnd one of their selections – the New England Patriots – have reached the final and only need to beat the Atlanta Falcons win Super Bowl 51.\nThe stunt is this year’s version of #TeamBJ – a porn event which has been running since 2010 which allows fans to ‘meet’ their favourite performers.\n\nIn 2012, adult stars Sara Jay and Angelina Castro released a #TeamBJ DVD having issued the same promise to their Twitter followers before Miami Heat won the NBA title.\nSara Jay returned two years later alongside fellow porn star Siri to release a second DVD after Germany won the World Cup.\n‘This is my first ever #TeamBJ so I have no idea what to expect.’ said Valentina.\n‘I am nervous and excited at the same time. I will be on the edge of my seat the entire game. I’d love to give Bill Belichick a BJ if the Patriots win… he hardly ever smiles.’\nMORE: Arsene Wenger REWARDS his Arsenal flops ahead of Chelsea clash \nMORE: Manchester United deny reports Antoine Griezmann has agreed summer move ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:31:57.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
