Must have realised what a disastrous move it would be for Tories. February 2, 2017 \nFallon’s remarks risk fuelling nationalist resentment about the Tories’ small mandate in Scotland, where it has only one MP out of 59. Sturgeon earlier this week suggested she could decide to call that snap referendum as early as next month , before the UK government formally triggers article 50. \nSpeaking after she had pressed Theresa May , the prime minister, to accept that Scotland deserved privileged access to the single market because it voted against leaving the EU, Sturgeon said: “In terms of me getting a sense of whether Scotland is going to be listened to at all, that period between now and triggering of article 50 is absolutely crucial. \n“The next few weeks are not going to resolve every issue of Brexit, but in terms of me being able to judge whether Scotland’s voice is going to be heard at all in this process … the next few weeks are very important.” \nRepeated opinion polls show the majority of Scottish voters do not want a quick new referendum and support for leaving the UK is at about 45% – below the majority Sturgeon needs. Stephen Low, a Scottish union official close to Jeremy Corbyn, the UK Labour leader, accused Fallon of handing Sturgeon a propaganda gift. \nHe tweeted: (((Stephen Low))) (@underaredflag) SNP don't want a second referendum - but a big pointless fight about their right to hold one is just the distraction they were looking for. https://t.co/gvEgYX4KoU February 2, 2017 \nRuth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader at Holyrood, where the Conservatives are the second largest party, has been at pains to stress it would be inconceivable that the UK government would block a new referendum if Holyrood voted in favour of one. \nFallon, in Scotland for a series of defence-related visits, tried to bolster Davidson’s position by attacking the Scottish government’s record on domestic policy. \n“All this talk of a second referendum is a diversion by the SNP, away from their day job on which Ruth Davidson and the Conservatives have been harrying them on, which is to get to grips with the problems they were elected to deal with, and not get into the theology of whether a second referendum should be held,” Fallon said. \n“They should forget all that and get on with what they were elected to do, which is improve school standards, tackling the problems in the Scottish health service and above all helping to improve the Scottish economy, where it is alarming that unemployment is now rising again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:34:52.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
