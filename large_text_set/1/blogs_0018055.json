Martellus Bennett is celebrating his first Super Bowl trip in style. (Charles Krupa/AP) \nBennett has filled the void at tight end since Rob Gronkowski’s season ended with back surgery, hauling in five catches for 52 yards in Sunday’s win. \nHe should enjoy it now, as Belichick likely won’t tolerate any more dancing until after the Super Bowl.
