Redknapp: Arsenal lack mental strength so Wenger should keep quiet \nNegotiations between the two clubs have been taking place over the past few days to come to a resolution and Wenger will be sat in the middle tier of the East Stand, which is the side of the ground where the dressing rooms are situated. \nIt is believed Chelsea have already been putting arrangements in place for stewarding to escort the Arsenal manager to and from his seat. \nThe Gunners will also be bringing their own security personnel to ensure everything goes smoothly. They will sit around him during the match to act as a precautionary buffer from the home fans. \nMeanwhile, the Blues have been handed cause for concern ahead of the title run-in with the news that Eden Hazard has joined David Luiz in picking up an injury. \nLuiz has been playing through the pain barrier with a knee problem for the past two months and Standard Sport understands that Belgium international Hazard suffered a knock against Leicester last month that has been affecting his performances.
