But they’ll also be driven by lots and lots of money. Fly me to the moon … Ok https://t.co/6QT8m5SHwn Advertisement \n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 27, 2017 \nThe two individuals, whose names were not released, will be paying an also-undisclosed but “significant” amount of money to be the first civilians to circle the moon. \nSpaceX plans to launch them aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon Heavy rocket, neither of which have been tested in space yet. \nThe Crew Dragon is scheduled to make its first test flight to the International Space Station, without people aboard, in November of this year. Its first crewed flight is scheduled for May 2018. The first Falcon Heavy launch is planned for sometime in early 2017. \nGiven the fact that the spacecraft haven’t been fully tested yet, let alone vetted for humans, a crewed launch in 2018 seems like an optimistic timeline. Some observers are sceptical. I'm doubtful of such a tight timeline as @SpaceX yet to take @NASA astronauts into orbit or successful launching of new Falcon Heavy rocket \n— Alan Duffy (@astroduff) February 27, 2017 What Mika said. This is cool, but no way is it going to happen in 2018. Elon calendar correction as usual. Probably 2020 at best. https://t.co/NwK54zVoAp \nBut last year, when SpaceX announced plans to send a Dragon capsule to Mars by 2018 , the mood was optimistic. \n“I wouldn’t put anything past these folks,” said Jim Bell of Arizona State University in Tempe at the time. \nThis story is being updated as we learn more. \nMore on these topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:38:48.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
