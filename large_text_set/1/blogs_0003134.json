Advertisement \nThe Kingston DataTraveler Ultimate Generation Terabyte (GT) flash drive isn’t exactly tiny, but compared to the external backup drive sitting on your desk, it’s probably considerably more pocket-friendly and easy to travel with. \nWhen eventually available the USB 3.0 drive will presumably arrive with an equally massive price tag, but those two terabytes of storage also come wrapped in a tough zinc-alloy metal casing that can survive sub-zero temperatures all the way down to 40 below zero, and protect your data all the way to up to a toasty 185 degrees Fahrenheit. But all that armor won’t protect a single byte of data if you lose it.
