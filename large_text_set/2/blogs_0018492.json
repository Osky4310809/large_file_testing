And now? We may soon be seeing firework Oreos on our grocery store shelves .\nWhat’s a firework Oreo, you ask? It’s a combination of everyone’s favorite cookie laced with popping candy, not unlike Trader Joe’s hot-as-hell Fireworks Chocolate Bar (though that sweet treat also includes traces of actual chile peppers).\nInstagram account The Junk Food Aisle made the big Oreo cookie reveal Tuesday, sharing a photo of a mocked-up package of the cookies . Be forewarned, though: According to Delish, Oreo has yet to confirm the existence of the cookies — so you might want to take this news with a grain of salt until further notice.\nComing Soon! Limited Edition Firework Oreo with Popping Candy! I mocked these up a few months ago when word first got out but this is a more official look at the packaging #thejunkfoodaisle \nA post shared by The Junk Food Aisle (@thejunkfoodaisle) on Feb 20, 2017 at 1:17pm PST \nThere’s some evidence to suggest that the cookies are real, though. Delish reports that The Junk Food Aisle has been right about many product launches in the past, announcing the — accurate — release of Reese’s Puffs Bunnies and Cherry Sprite, for example. Plus, the account makes it clear when a mocked-up product image is nothing but a fantasy, as it did with the fake sugar cookie Oreos below.\nLimited Edition Sugar Cookie Oreos! Are they real? No. Do @kalielynne_ @flyrymose & @kerr_mathers want them to be? Yes. Let us know your own dream Oreo flavor (or any junk food item) and we'll mockup our favorites! #thejunkfoodaisle \nA post shared by The Junk Food Aisle (@thejunkfoodaisle) on Dec 15, 2016 at 2:20pm PST \nThe caption clearly indicates that the cookies aren’t real, and the image shows three question marks — ??? — to the left of the product name, whereas in the firework Oreo image, the question marks are replaced by a “Coming Soon!” declaration.\nIt’s all very ~mysterious~ and we can’t wait to find out the truth about these sweet delights. In the meantime, we’ll start preparing our tastebuds for the (almost) literal fire that could be coming our way.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:55:32.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
