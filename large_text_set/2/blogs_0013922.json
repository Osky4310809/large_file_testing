Still, this one’s a new one for us. Chelsea in contention to sign Borussia Mönchengladbach’s Mahmoud Dahoud #cfc https://t.co/BtwDuf7Vq6 — Ed Aarons (@ed_aarons) February 17, 2017 As per the Guardian’s Ed Aarons, Chelsea are just one of at least four clubs who are possibly targeting midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud. The 21-year-old’s contract is expiring in 18 months, so there’s all the usual shenanigans going on with contract negotiations and leverage and agent whispers. Presumably Gladbach want him to stay, but he’s either undecided or just angling for more money. Told no decision on Mahmoud #Dahoud future yet despite reports he will join Dortmund. Player has interest from PSG, Juventus & Chelsea #cfc — Ed Aarons (@ed_aarons) February 17, 2017 That’s not to say that Chelsea’s (or Juve’s or PSG’s or BVB’s or City’s ) interest isn’t real. We could certainly do worse than to sign the young Germany international, who’s risen to prominence in the last couple seasons. He’s more Kante than Matic, with a seemingly endless engine and plenty of forward drive. And a price tag to match, too, probably well north of €30m — though recent rumors in Germany claim that something closer to just €10m might do the trick, which would be a tremendous bargain especially when compared to the likes of Kessie (whose recent links with Manchester United and Roma will only drive the price up).
