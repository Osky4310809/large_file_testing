(AP) — Arkansas’ governor signed a sweeping gun rights measure into law on Wednesday that will allow concealed handguns at state colleges, some bars, government buildings and even the state Capitol. \nThe measure approved by Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson allows someone with a concealed handgun license to carry at the locations if they undergo up to eight hours of active-shooter training. Hutchinson chaired a National Rifle Association task force that called for trained, armed staff at schools after the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. \nThe measure signed Wednesday has faced opposition from university officials, who said the decision on whether to allow guns on campus should remain with the schools. The University of Arkansas and Arkansas State University systems said they would prepare for their campuses to comply with the law when it takes effect. \nA lawmaker whose district includes the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville called the law “horrifying,” and noted it even allows concealed guns at Razorback football games and other sporting events in government-owned facilities. \n“People like to have a good time before the game, during the game, people get emotional and angry during the game,” Democratic Rep. Greg Leding said. “I think the idea of introducing loaded weapons into those situations is just ridiculous.” \n\nNot going to get into gun control issues so if you came here looking for a political fight you can turn right around and look somewhere else. I don’t really have a strong stance on guns either way so I wouldn’t even be that fun to argue with anyway. I don’t know if I’m really knowledgeable enough to offer an informed opinion. \nKnow what I am knowledgeable about? SEC sports fans. Specifically SEC football fans. Those motherfuckers man. Those people are lunatics. Those people care more about their teams than you care about anything in the world. Seriously grab a pen and paper right now and list the 5 things that mean the most to you – SEC fans care more about their college team than all of those combined multiplied by 35. And it’s almost exclusively AWESOME. They get hammered drunk. They talk unbelievable shit. They fight. They got caught on video and give me nonstop blog material. Fights in the stands, fights at the tailgate, fights all over the stadium. \nWhat wouldn’t be awesome is if those lunatics were strapped with fucking handguns during these fights. Judging by how quickly the fists fly over a bad call or a late touchdown or just some random trash talk, there’s no doubt in my mind the bullets will start flying just as fast. And murder videos are a whol lost less bloggable than scraped knuckles and bloody fist videos. \nIf you insist on doing it maybe do a test run on like, the AAC or Big 10 or something? Can we compromise?? Kmarko |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:22:14.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
