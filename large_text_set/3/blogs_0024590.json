This means incorporating food trends like locally sourced ingredients and partnerships with hometown brands and companies.\" \nThe Taste of Braves Country program includes dishes from throughout the Southeast, highlighted by: \n• Georgia: Fox Bros. BBQ; Hugh Acheson 1st & 3rd Hot Dog and Sausage Shack, Chick-fil-A; Waffle House.• South Carolina: Pimento Cheese Patty Melt, served with caramelized onions and smoked paprika on rye.• North Carolina: Smoked whole hog BBQ sandwich, served on white bread with chopped southern slaw and vinegar BBQ sauce.• Tennessee: Nashville Hot Chicken, served with bread & butter pickles.• Mississippi: Blackened Catfish Po’ Boy Taco, served with slaw and Comeback Sauce.• Alabama: Fried Tomahawk Pork Chop, served on an extra-large potato roll with collard green slaw and white BBQ sauce. \nFans can find the Farm to Fan logo at concession stands that feature produce from locally-sourced outlets. Ingredients will vary throughout the season based on market availability. \nAlong with those initiatives, SunTrust Park will also have Atlanta staples throughout its concession stands, including H&F Burger, Gu's Dumplings, King of Pops, Mayfield Creamery Ice Cream and a Tomahawk Ice Cream Bar from local producer High Road Craft Creamery. \n\"Braves fans come from far and wide, and each one has a different and delicious food they enjoy while watching a baseball game,\" said Shawn Mattox, Delaware North's general manager at SunTrust Park. \"We designed a menu that underscores the diversity of southern cooking and created dishes that we know all fans will enjoy while in Atlanta for a game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:38:56.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
