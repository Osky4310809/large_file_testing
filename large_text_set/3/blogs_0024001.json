This clearly shows that nothing has changed. The Inspector-General of Police, Mr Joseph Boinnet, must urgently investigate the activities of these officers,” said Mr Oywa. \nUsenge residents have been calling for the removal of the Quick Response Team police unit, whom they have accused of harassment. \n“We are not happy with the presence of the QRT in the area. They have resorted to beating up everybody on sight and arresting innocent boda boda riders operating in Usenge and its environs,” said a resident who sought anonymity. \nIn February, the journalist and activist reported to the Bondo DCIO that their lives were in danger. \nTORTURE \nEfforts to get comments from the police the arrests bore no fruit as the officers and Bondo police boss Paul Kiarie did not answer calls or reply to text messages. \nOn Tuesday, Administration Police officers, under the command of Inspector Benard Ongoro, injured one person and confiscated several motorbikes after the officers allegedly started torturing the youth for unknown reasons. \nThe alleged harassment sparked protests among members of the public. \nThe locals shouted at the officers, who later escaped from the wrath of the mob which threatened to attack them. \nREVENGE \nThe officers are believed to be on a revenge mission by arresting the youths, including the journalist and activists, for being at the forefront advocating for their removal. \nBondo MP Gideon Ochanda has condemned the incident and has vowed to ensure that the journalist and the activist are released on free police bond. \nDr Ochanda said the actions by police would only raise tension and animosity between the residents and the police. \nFREE BOND \nHe asked the police QRT unit to stop harassing locals, insisting that he would call for their removal from the town if similar incidents are reported to his office. \n“I am headed to the police station to secure their release on free bond and I hope no case will be filed against them as they did not commit any offence. It is sad that the reason for their arrest is very flimsy,” said Dr Ochanda. \nThe two were released Thursday morning on a free bond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T07:29:05.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
