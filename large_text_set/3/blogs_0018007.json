Read more Labour promises to ban fracking \nWhile the 'sidetrack' is designed to find oil and does not involve fracking – the controversial process of shattering rocks to release gas – the case could have wider significance if the UK develops a major fracking industry. \nThat would see a large number of wells drilled into the countryside, each with a number of branch lines extending from a central hub. \nIf planning permission is not required for each new branch, this would make it simpler for the industry and harder for local opponents to prevent the escalation of activity at each site. If planning consent is needed, the reverse would be true. \nAngus Energy said in a statement that it was of the “firm opinion” that the sidetrack “did not constitute a breach of the planning consents”, adding it had been approved by the Oil & Gas Authority, Environment Agency and Health and Safety Executive. Major oil firm warns future drilling may be 'economically infeasible' \nThe firm was even more dismissive of suggestions it needed planning permission in a posting on its website in which it asked “ what is the fuss about? ”. \n“The Government’s guidelines make it absolutely clear that the remit of local councils covers the surface impact of the operations including matters such as noise, visual impact and traffic movements,” it said. \n“All of our surface work was covered by our planning permission. We work with our local council on many important surface issues that rely on their expertise and requirements.” \nThe firm said “no new well was drilled”, only what a “sidetrack”. This, it added, “doesn’t need planning permission according to Surrey County Council’s own criteria”. \n“Despite having every opportunity at a number of meetings and in extensive correspondence, Surrey County Council has not identified any way in which the sidetrack causes any planning harm,” Angus Energy said. \n“Any characterisation that Angus Energy deliberately misled its investors and the public or misunderstood clear advice is offensive, wrong and self-serving.” Fracking is back: Controversial gas extraction process to resume in UK Fracking is back: Controversial gas extraction process to resume in UK 1/2 Fracking: How It Works 2/2 Fracking Map UK \nThe company stressed it had no plans to carry out fracking at the well, something that has attracted considerable local protests at a number of other sites around the country. \nAngus Energy’s confidence that it had not breached planning law was not shared by the council. \nThe local authority said in a statement: “We were extremely disappointed to find out that Angus Energy has acted without planning permission and contrary to our advice and guidance so we are currently in discussions with them as a matter of urgency to resolve this.” \nA council spokesman told The Independent that there was “a possibility” the company could be required to remove the well or 'sidetrack', but he added this was “unlikely” given it was already there. \n“They could get punished for what they have done or they could apply for retrospective planning permission,” he said. “They could be fined, there’s a multitude of things that could happen. They might just get a severe warning.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:43:03.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
