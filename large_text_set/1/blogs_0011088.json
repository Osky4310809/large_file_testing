(Photo: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images) \nAmerica awoke this morning to a bombshell. Or shall I call it, an alleged bombshell? An unsubstantiated report that the Russians have blackmail-worthy scoop on Donald Trump . \nCue CNN: “The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump.” \nMORE: Trump says 'I have nothing to do with Russia' \nTwo things occur: \nNo. 1. This story should, at this point, be taken with a grain of salt the size of a mountain. Nothing in the 35-page dossier has been confirmed, yet Buzzfeed saw fit to publish every last salacious, unverified, uncorroborated claim. This, even as it notes the report has “some clear errors.” Even as its editor-in-chief noted there is “serious reason to doubt the allegations.” \nSo, of course, he printed it every last word of it and no doubt is reaping the rewards today in “clicks.” \nAs Donald Trump might say: “sad.” \nI'm going to do the old fashioned thing in this, the age of internet insta-conclusions, and withhold judgment. What don't we already know about Trump? \nAnd No. 2. What could Donald Trump possibly have done that leads anyone to believe that he would succumb to blackmail in order to keep it quiet? \nWe already know that he doesn’t pay taxes and that he says disparaging things about virtually every group other than, well, guys like him. \nWe already know that he sees no real value in women beyond fairness of face. Remember when he said that Carly Fiorina is just too ugly to be president? \n“Look at that face!\" Trump told Rolling Stone last year when a shot of Fiorina flashed on a nearby TV. \"Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!\" \nWe already know he’s a hound dog who views women’s bodies as his personal playground. Heck, we heard him joke about sexually assaulting women and we elected him anyway. \nWe already know that he lies regularly, that he speaks without the benefit of having facts and is so thin skinned that he unloads on actresses who dare to criticize him. Trump's Russia ties have been well reported \nAnd we've long known that Trump’s a fan of Vladmir Putin, which is both appalling and just plain scary given Putin’s tendencies to imprison critics on trumped-up charges, smear the media (sound familiar?) and silence his opponents rather permanently (if you know what I mean). \nWe already know that his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, previously worked for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. \nWe already know that Putin helped him get elected and that Trump has appointed a pal of Putin’s to be secretary of State. That he sided with Putin over the CIA when it concluded that Putin employed hackers in an effort to rig a U.S. presidential election. \nMONTINI: If Russian hackers have dirt on Trump, think they'll use it? \nShort of finding out that Putin's a partner in Trump's casinos or has been given the key to the Lincoln Bedroom, what embarrassing ammo could the Rooskeys possibly have that they could use to blackmail Trump – a guy who appears to have no shame? \nMe? I’m thinking our new leader was positively prescient a year ago. \n\"I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody,” he said, “and I wouldn't lose voters.” Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2jvYfsH Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:05:12.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
