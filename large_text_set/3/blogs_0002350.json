(Kevin Richardson / Baltimore Sun) \nMedia columnist David Zurawik says that Trump's war on the press is no worse than Obama's. (Kevin Richardson / Baltimore Sun) David Zurawik : He's the most dangerous president ever, and nothing good can come of his tenure.\nIf you want to go that route, go ahead. I am not attempting to defend Trump. \nWhat I am deeply concerned about is the way the media have been covering him and, in some cases, feeding that worst-ever narrative. Trump is being treated unfairly in some parts of the mainstream media, and unless we deal with it honestly and openly, we are the ones who will wind up losing credibility even as we point our fingers at Trump for his lies. \nWhat tipped the balance on writing this column was the over-the-top reaction to Sean Spicer , Trump's press secretary, excluding some reporters from an informal, off-camera briefing Feb. 24 called a gaggle. \nI can't tell you how tired I am of hearing people in the media who clearly have no understanding of the horrors of the Holocaust talking about Nazis and Hitler these days.\nThere are millions of people still living with hearts and minds heavily scarred by what happened to family members... \nStop it, please. \nI can't tell you how tired I am of hearing people in the media who clearly have no understanding of the horrors of the Holocaust talking about Nazis and Hitler these days. \nThere are millions of people still living with hearts and minds heavily scarred by what happened to family members... (David Zurawik) \nThe word \"unprecedented\" was used along with the idea that Trump had gone where no modern president ever has by allowing his press secretary to exclude The New York Times , CNN, the Los Angeles Times, Politico, BuzzFeed and others from the session. \nDean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, set the tone, writing: \"Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties,\" \n\"The decision struck veteran White House journalists as unprecedented in the modern era,\" correspondents Dylan Byers, Sara Murray and Kevin Liptak wrote in a reaction piece at CNN Money. \nEven my own paper joined the chorus in the wake of Spicer's gaggle. Zurawik: Let’s stop the Hitler talk \nLet’s stop the Hitler, Nazi talk and other forms of extreme speech seeping into the mainstream on cable TV. Keep marginalized voices at the margins. \nLet’s stop the Hitler, Nazi talk and other forms of extreme speech seeping into the mainstream on cable TV. Keep marginalized voices at the margins.

Even by Trumpian standards … the White House antagonism toward the news media has been extraordinary.\" \nI predicted the nasty nature of this battle in December on a year-end special hosted by Megyn Kelly titled \"The Media and Trump.\" I said that Trump was not only going to try and bypass the mainstream media in reaching Americans via digital platforms like Twitter and Facebook, he was also going to kick top press dogs like The New York Times in the teeth as he passed by. \nI said it was going to be ugly, and I deplore the fact that it now is every bit as nasty as I thought. I hate hearing Trump say such things as the press is the \"enemy of the people,\" because I know many among the 63 million who voted for him are going to believe what he says. And that's going to make for more polarization in a nation that already feels more like a collection of enemy camps than anything resembling E Pluribus Unum. I hate seeing Trump play us against each other this way. \nBut as someone who fervently embraces legacy values, I also believe that you try to the tell the truth even if it favors someone you don't especially like. Actually, if you know you don't like someone, I believe you should go out of your way to make sure you are being fair to them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:02:26.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
