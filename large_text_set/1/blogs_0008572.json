We had the big three running on offence and the defence stopped the run,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. \nHOUSTON TEXANS 27 — OAKLAND RAIDERS 14 \nBrock Osweiler finally looked like the player Houston spent $72 million on, throwing for a touchdown and running for another to lead the Texans to a 27-14 NFL wild-card playoff win over the Oakland Raiders. Osweiler, benched on Dec. 18, got his job back this week with Tom Savage out due to a concussion, and played his best game of the season to give the Texans their first playoff victory since the 2012. \nAfter a Nick Novak field goal, DeAndre Hopkins had a touchdown reception for the Texans and Lamar Miller gave Houston a 10-0 lead in the first quarter on a TD run one play after Jadeveon Clowney’s first career interception. Miller scampered untouched on the next play for a 4-yard touchdown. \nHouston and its top-ranked defence, led by Clowney and Whitney Mercilus, bounced back after an embarrassing 30-0 wild-card loss to Kansas City last season to advance to face either the Chiefs or New England in the divisional round next weekend. Texans take AFC wildcard game 0:45 \nNFL: The Houston Texans are one step closer to a home Superbowl, after topping the injury-riddled Oakland Raiders in the AFC wildcard game.
