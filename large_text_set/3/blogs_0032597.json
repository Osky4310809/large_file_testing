Once the report is finished in 90 days it will be used as a \"basis for decision making by the administration,\" he noted. \nThat way, the decisions can be \"based on hard facts, not theories,\" the Commerce secretary said, adding that the data will be used in NAFTA negotiations.

When asked if this was a sign that Trump would talk directly to President Xi Jinping — who is meeting with Trump in a week at his Mar-A-Lago club in Florida — about the deficit, Ross said declined to comment. \nRELATED: Upcoming U.S.-China summit \nNational Trade Council Director Peter Navarro told reporters that the executive orders have nothing to do with Trump's meeting with China's leader. \nBriefing press minutes after the president sent out cryptic tweets about the coming China negotiation, Navarro said \"nothing we're saying tonight is about China. Let's not make this about China.\" ...and job losses. American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017 \nOther countries with large trade deficits with the U.S., according to Ross, are Japan, Germany, Mexico, Ireland, Vietnam, Italy, South Korea, Malaysia, India, Thailand, France, Switzerland, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Canada. Ross added that this is not to say \"that everybody on this little list is an evil doer. That's not the case.\" \nA second executive order that the president will sign Friday is aimed at deterring the dumping of products on the U.S. market.
