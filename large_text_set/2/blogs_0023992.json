The vehicles are part of an expansion plan after BYD’s initial fleet of e-taxis began operating in the country in 2014, operated by HDT Holdings in partnership with Grab. \nAccording to the company, the introduction of the 100 e6 taxis is estimated to reduce around 46,400 tonnes of carbon emissions a year, which is roughly equivalent to saving 26,000 trees. “This is only the beginning,as there will be more BYD products and services for Singaporeans in the future. BYD will continue to support Singapore in its noble ambition for sustainable transportation,” said Liu Xueliang, general manager, sales division of BYDAsia Pacific Auto. \nThe e6 is a compact MPV that measures 4,560 mm long, 1,822 mm wide and 1,645 mm tall, with a wheelbase of 2,830 mm. It is propelled by a 121 hp (90 kW)/450 Nm electric motor that draws its power from a 61.4 kWh battery. \nOn a full charge, the e6 is capable of delivering a zero emissions range of up to 400 km. Recharging via a VTOG 30 kW AC charging outlet will take about two hours, whereas it is eight to nine hours with SAE Level 2 AC charging stations. \nThere are currently e6 taxi fleets operational in China, Colombia, Belgium, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States (New York and Chicago). BYD also supplies electric buses (e-bus), which are currently used for the BRT Sunway Line . \nGALLERY: BYD e6", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:02:05.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
