The third restaurant in the ABC empire opened yesterday, after being first announced in 2013 . You may remember from previous Eater New York posts that the V in the restaurant name stands for vegetables. AbcV’s chef de cuisine Neal Harden ( Pure Food and Wine ), is serving all vegetarian as well as vegan dishes including shallot and herb labneh with crispy mushrooms and sunchoke chips; a dosa with yogurt, avocado, and sprouts; and a kale sandwich with mint pesto and avocado. For breakfast, the menu lists a chia bowl with dates, scrambled eggs with broccoli, and congee. Browse the full menus here . AbcV is now open for breakfast, lunch, and to-go, with brunch and dinner set to launch “soon.” Hopefully we wont have to wait for either as long as we waited for the restaurant.
