Tuxedo — the rowdy duo comprised of Jake One and Mayer Hawthorne — and their latest video, “2nd Time Around,” hit the second slot with their visit to the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas. Nardwuar’s interview with Yo Gotti, Migos on SportsCenter, and Troy Ave cooking up cocaine in his possibly illegal video shoot round out the top five. Keep scrolling for a Peanut Da Don remix from T.I., freestyles from battle rappers Hallow Da Don and Okwerdz, Locksmith acting as a Lyft driver, and music from Otis Clapp and Azizi Gibson . joey bada$$ f. Schoolboy q –“rockabye baby” \nAfter the announcement of his sophomore album All-Amerikkkan Bada$$ earlier this month, Joey Bada$$ returns with another single from the project. Titled “Rockabye Baby,” the track also boasts a guest appearance from TDE rapper ScHoolboy Q. The Brooklyn artist shared the official album artwork that was banned from a number of physical retailers on Wednesday (March 29). The track comes in the wake of Joey’s politically charged video for “Land of the Free.” Check out the new track above. Tuxedo –“2nd Time ARound” \nJake One and Mayer Hawthorne’s joint project, Tuxedo, released its new album Tuxedo II via Stones Throw last week. To commemorate the occasion, the duo is back with a video for the lead single from the project, “2nd Time Around.” Filmed at the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas, which is operated by the owner of Pinball Pete in Ann Arbor, the video finds Hawthorne at home in a place where he first learned to play pinball. yo gotti vs. nardwuar –“INTERVIEW” \nYo Gotti is Nardwuar’s latest victim while the colorful Canadian personality was doing the rounds at SXSW in Austin, Texas earlier this month. Par for the course, Nardwuar blew Gotti’s mind by pulling out various items that were somehow related to the Memphis rapper’s past. migos –“SPortscenter interview” \nMigos sat down with SportsCenter to discuss the Atlanta trio’s influence on the culture, what “Bad & Boujee” really means, their sudden rise in notoriety, and what it takes to “make it” in the industry. Their advice — “grind and stay consistent.” troy ave –“just cookin” \nSet to the tune of Monica’s 1995 hit, “Don’t Take It Personal (Just One Of Dem Days),” Troy Ave delivers a new video for “Just Cookin,” apparently his ode to cooking cocaine. According to 2DopeBoyz , the Brooklyn location where the video was shot was eventually raided by the ATF, but Troy wasn’t there when it happened. Troy Ave just dropped his Dope Boy Troy project last week. T.I. & peanut da Don –“trenches reloaded (Remix)” \nAfter revealing he and his Hustle Gang crew are ready to release a follow-up to 2014’s Get Dough Or Die 2, GDOD3, T.I. has shared a remix of the late Atlanta rapper Peanut Da Don’s “Trenches Reloaded.” The track follows the DJ Whoo Kid and DJ MLK-assisted “Do My Thing,” and finds the Us Or Else artist calmly delivering his laid back, Southern drawl-infused raps. hollow da don & Okwerdz –“freestyle vault” \nThe Freestyle Vault kicks off another session with battle rappers Hollow Da Don and Okwerdz, which finds the pair going off about everything from haikus to toothpicks during the eight-minute video. locksmith –“lock lyft episode 4” \nIn order to promote his forthcoming album, Olive Branch, Bay Area MC Locksmith is back with episode four of his self-described “webisode.” On March 25, he chose 10 lucky fans to play his unreleased album Olive Branch while he acted as their Lyft driver. Oddly enough, it worked. Olive Branch is expected to arrive Friday (March 31). Otis clapp –“just chill” \nOtis Clapp gives a clever shout out to legendary radio personality Chuck Chillout in his new song, “Just Chill,” which is the third track from his forthcoming Helen Keller EP. The project is expected to arrive sometime in May. azizi gibson –“high” \nProduced by Kamandi, Azizi Gibson’s latest track, “High,” is another dark production from the often bleak rapper. Formerly signed to Brainfeeder, the gifted MC is readying his upcoming project, Memoirs of the Reaper.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:46:44.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
