Police are hunting two supects after the violent clash \nMr Bergonzi - who has been studying the martial art Krav Maga for three years at West Norwood Health and Leisure Centre - told the Standard: “I was sat in my office when I saw these two guys on a motorbike looking completely wrong. \n“I’d had cameras installed after my son’s bike was stolen and I watched them walk across the drive where my car and bike were parked. They were completely brazen. \n“I picked up a stick, which folds out into nunchucks, and went outside. One man was behind my motorbike screwing the number plate off. \n“He saw me coming and put the screw driver down and started crying, saying ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry’. \n“I realised he was only fourteen or fifteen years old and I didn’t know what would happen. The second suspect sought by police \n“Then his friend turned up with the bike. I was distracted and he grabbed the nunchucks and he hit me several times. \n“I couldn’t take on them both so I rushed the guy with the nunchucks and he dropped them.” \nTwo neighbours, one carrying a baseball bat, rushed out to help Mr Bergonzi before the two men ran off. \nThey returned minutes later to retrieve the motorbike they arrived on, which police later said was also stolen. \nMr Bergonzi urged the public to know their rights and how to defend themselves before they become ‘have a go heroes’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T11:58:20.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
