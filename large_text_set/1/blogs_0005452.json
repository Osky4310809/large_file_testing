The 1,000-horsepower monster made its debut at last year's SEMA show, and Leno has nothing but good things to say about it. He also says it's the most powerful Camaro he has ever driven. The car's monstrous power comes courtesy of a custom-built 416 cu. in. LS3 V8, atop which is a Whipple supercharger. The engine cranks out a hefty 800 lb-ft of torque. It's a wild powerplant that routes output through a Tremec T56 transmission and custom Chevrolet 12-bolt rear axle. However, for as radical as the powertrain is, the car is shockingly subtle on the outside. It's also the car's exterior that garners many of Leno's kudos. He gushes over all of the small tweaks that look factory, but aren't. For instance, the '69 Camaro's famous character lines that trail behind the wheel arches receive a small extension forward of the front wheel arches. The grille is also inspired by the Camaro RS unit, but has a tapered point in the middle. It also doesn't have sliding head light covers. Instead, the lights simply shine through. Other details include the roof, which has been stepped down in the middle to give the roof a double-bubble look. The taillights also look similar to the original versions, but are custom machined (yes, machined) and have LEDs inside. The bumpers are very original looking, but are actually completely custom, and each is a single-piece that was machined from billet aluminum. We don't want to spoil all of the cool details, though. So check out the video at the top. It's a sharp car, and unsurprisingly, it does nice burnouts, too.
