Share Save \nOverwatch's Winter Wonderland event may be over, but Blizzard has one more present in store for players: a new map. Blizzard's been teasing the new control point map for a few months now, promising a new control point map with new environmental hazards and traversal options. Indeed, that's all here -- Oasis features jump pads that launch players high in the air and an active highway filled with deadly traffic. And yes, getting in the way of a car is a one-hit kill . \nThe map is new to players on Overwatch's main servers, but has actually been available on the game's public test realm since late November. Still, getting early access meant downloading a completely separate version of the game -- now it's just part of game. The map is free to all players, including and is available starting today on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T02:24:21.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
