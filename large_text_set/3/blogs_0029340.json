Police are still hunting associates of Masood who are believed to be linked to the Westminster attack. Westminster attack 'hero' MP Tobias Ellwood appointed to Privy Council \nIt has also emerged that 52 year old Masood used the Whatsapp messaging service just minutes before he smashed his hired Hyundai car into the railings at the Houses of Parliament. \nA number registered to one of his previous addresses was in operation at 2.37 pm on Wednesday : the emergency services began to receive reports of the attack at 2.40 pm. \nThere is no evidence that anyone else accompanied Masood during the rampage in which he murdered four people and injured 50 others. But the timing and sequence of the radicalisation of Masood, born Adrian Elms, will, the law agencies believe, provide important pointers towards what unfolded. \nMasood had come to the notice of MI5 and Scotland Yard’ Special Branch in the past for associating with known extremists, but, security officials insist, had not been involved in plotting terrorist acts. Khalid Masood (Metropolitan Police) \nThere has been speculation that the radicalisation process began when he went to work as an English teacher in Saudi Arabia in 2005. \nThe indications, however, are that it is more likely to have taken place while he served sentences in prison for violent offences. \nAfter being freed in 2003 from his second time in jail he married Farzana Malik, a Muslim woman following conversion. \nIt was his increasing interest in fundamentalist Islam which is said to have taken him to Saudi Arabia. The security agencies are, however, examining whether he met with extremists there and had maintained contact with them since. \nIronically, in the light of what was to happen, finding Islam also seemed to have curbed Masood’s violent nature, those who know him have told investigators. Met Police announce that terror perpetrator Khalid Masood was born Adrian Russell \nHe had previously been engaged in repeated acts of criminality under a number of aliases. Both of his serious convictions had been in relation to stabbing attacks and he had been arrested on other occasions for aggressive actions. \nMasood and his wife, who have three children, are said to have later divorced. But changing religion also brought a change to Masood’s circle of friends and acquaintances with him gravitating to those sharing his conservative interpretation of Islam. \nHe is also said to have spent long hours indoors during the day, a lot of the time on the Internet. \nWhether he was steered towards terrorism online is a major part of the inquiry with a number of computers and tablets, of the killer and those detained, being examined by police. \nScotland Yard Assistant Deputy Commissioner Mark Rowley said a “ massive amounts of computer data” was seized among 2,700 items in total. \nA series of attacks which had been previously written off as being the work of “lone wolves” were later found to have been orchestrated by Isis “ handlers” on the Internet.
