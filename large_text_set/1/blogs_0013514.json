ADVERTISEMENT \nIt was sweet revenge for the Filipinos after beating a Singapore team that has dealt them their two losses this season. \nLawrence Domingo had 12 points and 14 rebounds while import James Hughes tallied eight points and 15 boards apart from holding his ground against Singapore import Justin Howard who was held to 5-of-19 shooting. \nThe Slingers came within, 72-74, after a triple from Xavier Alexander with 42.6 seconds left. A five second violation called on Parks gave the Slingers a chance to force overtime, but Alexander, challenged by three Alab players at the rim, missed a potential game tying lay-up. \nIt was just the second loss in nine games for the Slingers. \nThe Scores \nALAB PILIPINAS 74 – Parks, Jr. 17, Domingo 14, Fortuna 12, Hughes 8, Carter 6, Acuña 6, Celiz 4, Hubalde 3, Gavieres 2, Mendoza 2, Cawaling 0, Knuttel 0. \nSINGAPORE SLINGERS 72- Alexander 24, Wei Long 14, Howard 13, Austria 3, Ng 3, Folkoff 3, Kwek 12, Oh 0, Lim 0. \nQUARTER SCORES: 17-10, 37-27, 55-46, 74-72", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T17:42:40.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
