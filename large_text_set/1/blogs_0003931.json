When my contract ends I may just end up leaving after 18 years. Yeah the other carriers do the same sh*t I’m just tired of Verizon’s crap moew \nThat’s what I did a year, maybe it’s been 2 now. UDP $65 cricket now. It’s been flawless. Me \nSprint does the same thing. Paying to stay loyal. Smh, unlocked is the way to go. thewandy \nweird when I go into a Verizon store and purchase a new phone or tablet I never get hit with an activation fee Liqwidzero \nBecause an activation fee is one time only for new lines of service. It’s dropped from $40 to $30. RustyDroidFan \nNo two-year contract price…big deal…But seriously increase the Upgrade Fee that is absurd. But leave it to Big Red if anyone can figure out a way to squeeze a few dollars out of someone its Big Red. EYEsee \nJust got a letter from them. They are disconnecting my lines as of Feb 16th if I don’t switch off of my unlimited plan. This is targeting over 8000 customers. \nOnly 1 line on my account has actually used what they consider to be “too much data” so they are disconnecting all of my lines. specz \nId file a complaint with the BBB and the fcc EYEsee \nI’m trying to fight it through several outlets. Unfortunately Verizon was smart about how they did it. Most of these governing bodies allow VZ 30 business days to respond. By that time I’d already have been disconnected…..But I’m definitely trying. Thank you. Defenestratus \nSorry to be the bearer of bad news but as soon as your original unlimited contract expired VZW was under no legal obligation to provide you wireless service any longer. EYEsee \nI get it. However, I extended one contract about a year ago, when u purchased a new phone. And nonetheless this is dirty and petty business tactics. I will fight it on principle. Win or lose. Baseer \nHow much data did you use? Mark Snider \nSo we are now going to charge $30 for nothing, because charging you $20 for nothing wasn’t enough. The only way a fee like this would make since is if the customer opted for excess amounts of help in store with activation and data transfer. If all you’re doing is popping a sim from one phone to the next it is a ridiculous fee. \nSide note, as an unlimited data user, I’m ok with the 200gb limit, and it is nice to finally have an actual number to work with. Average us for me is 75-100 but I did hit 125 once when I got both a new phone and tablet RazorSky \nThey don’t even change SIM anymore. I got my Pixel and he handed me the box and said it was good to go in about ten minutes. ali jawad \nI’m confused about the upgrade fee that is still imposed if I’m buying a new phone on either the device payment plan or in full… Is the “upgrade fee” really the activation fee that gets charged? Or is that an extra charge on top of the activation fee charge? #royallyConfused Armaced \nYou and me both, friend. Justin Osborne \n$30, really? $20 wasn’t enough of a rip off, now you gotta do this? Lucky Armpit \nThat’s one of the main reasons why I’ll never buy a carrier-branded phone. That and the bloat. Unlocked GS8E, here I come. Justin Osborne \nI wouldn’t have, but with $10 Pixel, I decided I would. Came out pretty good, selling my 6P for $300ish (after fees), which basically pays for the Pixel. Pitahson \nyup. getting the unlocked s8e from ebay unlocked. have bought my s6, note 5 and s7 edge that way. \nOnly Tint (T-mobile / Sprint Merger) can save us now from VZW and AT&T’s shenanigans. Trump will push it through now that Softbank has greased the wheels for the merger. allansm \nYes, dude, further monopolization is going to “save” us. \nJesus. Dealing with the level of ignorance nowadays is tiring. \nYeah because having a third company with the resources to actually change the market is a bad thing. Nick \nMaybe give some thought to the point before calling it ignorant. As it stands now, the T-Mobile and Sprint networks are too small to effect consumer-friendly change from the market leaders. T-Mobile is growing fast and has led many of the recent trends in the industry, but a merger could accelerate that growth and put the combined company in the same league as Verizon and AT&T. allansm \nT-Mobile prices have been steadily increasing while they push out ant-consumer practices. \nIn fact, the cheapest price for an individual now is $70 for throttled SD content. \nSprint is following suit. Combine them both and now you have 3 corporations holding all the power. There goes the competition. \nFurthermore, Leger & CO are trampling all over net neutrality. Anyone who isn’t a board member to one of these corporations , and is against net neutrality, is an imbecile. Tim Buchanan \nWhat about for business customers? Sean Plantz \nThis. I really can’t see that going away. Antonio Stephens", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:10:34.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
