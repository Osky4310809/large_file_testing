She was designed in her color to complement Elmo , [3] who was gaining popularity at the time of her introduction. Zoe was created to help balance what was then a predominately male cast of Muppets on the series. [4] \nZoe was originally unclothed, apart from jewelry and barrettes (which she is never seen without). [5] Starting in season 33 , however, Zoe has often been seen wearing a tutu, because, like many girls of her age, she is obsessed with ballet. Her love of dance is featured in the video Zoe's Dance Moves . \nShe occasionally rides a soapbox-style car around Sesame Street , called the Zoemobile . She has a pet rock, Rocco , much to Elmo's constant dismay and she owns a doll named Mimi . Her birthday is September 30, [6] however in a 2009 appearance on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? , she states that her birthday is in January. \nHer Aunt Chloe has been seen on the show, and her daddy has appeared in a few storybooks. Her Aunt Giselle , who lives in Swan Lake, sent her a tutu in season 34 . \nFrom Season 25 to Season 29 , she went to the Day Care Center . Contents [ show ] Development \nFrom the book Sesame Street Unpaved : \"From several possible designs of the character, 'I picked the one that had a face like Carol Channing ,' says Fran Brill. 'I wanted her to be obviously female with jewelry and barrettes in her hair. Someone suggested we call her Frannie, since that's my nickname. But I didn't want a Muppet with my name, so I thought of the J.D. Salinger book Franny and Zooey , and suggested Zoe, which seemed to be just right.\" \nTo prepare for the character, Brill went to Manhattan preschools and watched 3-year-old girls play. One of the girls said to Brill the phrase which became an early catchphrase for Zoe, \"Don't joke me.\" [7] When the first Zoe puppet was built, Krewson's daughter suggested they put sparkles in her hair. [8] \nBeginning with the 2005 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade , more hair was added to Zoe, including pink and glittery hairs. Starting with season 40 in 2009, a smaller puppet was used, based on the one created specifically for her role as Mousey the Hatter Helper in Abby in Wonderland . [9] This version was only used for season 40, and Brill uses the normal-sized Zoe puppet for the following season. [10] \nAt William Paterson University , Martin P. Robinson explained that Telly hadn't appeared in any scenes with the rebuilt Zoe, and Robinson expected that the moment they would meet, Telly would freak out. Fran Brill proceeded to take out the Zoe puppet, and sure enough, Telly freaked out. Notes Before Zoe wore her tutu as a permanent outfit, she wore it on street scenes for Episode 3851 and Episode 3916 . According to the Sesame Street Unpaved (book) , her favorite songs are \"Let's Go Crazy,\" \" Jump (For My Love) \" and \" Put on a Happy Face .\" However, in Episode 4169 , her favorite song was Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star . In the 2008 video Love the Earth! , she was a member of the Bear Scouts. Zoe got her own bed in Episode 3207 . Zoe learned how to play a trombone in Episode 3994 . Zoe's favorite letter is Z because her name starts with Z. In Episode 4228 , Zoe says she has a brother named Joey.
