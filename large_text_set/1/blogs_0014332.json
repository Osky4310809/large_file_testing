County Sheriff's Silence on Immigration Speaks Volumes \nCabrera explained that the L.A. County Sheriff's Department, which runs the local jail system, is \"most culpable in apprehending immigrants and leading them into the hands of ICE.\" Indeed, in 2015 a political battle broke out over the sheriff's policy of allowing ICE agents into jails. That's still the policy. \nLast week, McDonnell clarified his department's immigration stance in an editorial in what is arguably the city's most conservative major opinion page, that of the Daily News . While a sheriff's spokeswoman confirmed that the door is still open for ICE agents, she noted that the circumstances are limited. She pointed us to this passage from McDonnell's opinion piece: \nBefore allowing ICE agents access to interview any inmate in our jail, our personnel follow strict policies and procedures that are guided and informed by the Trust Act. Names are double-checked to ensure that only inmates who meet the release criteria established by the act are accessible to ICE agents. ICE agents are only allowed to interview inmates convicted of serious or violent crimes. ... These include crimes such as murder, robbery, rape, kidnapping and human trafficking. We will not detain any inmates beyond their scheduled release dates, regardless of whether or not there are valid ICE detainers. \nMcDonnell also vowed, \"My deputies will not detain or arrest any individual solely on suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.\" \nBut the department still, essentially, allows ICE to have the run of the jails, so long as McDonnell's criteria, above, are met. Today, the UCLA School of Law's International Human Rights Clinic, in collaboration with the ICE Out of L.A. Coalition, is expected to release \"a scathing critique of more than 20 years of entanglement between ICE and LASD,\" according to a statement. The report recommends \"disentangling county institutions from the federal immigration enforcement strategy.\" \nIn 2015, county supervisors Hilda Solis and Sheila Kuehl were behind a motion that ended a program that had allowed deputies in the jails to perform duties similar to those of ICE agents. McDonnell dragged his feet in doing away with an ICE cooperation agreement, nixed as part of the motion.
