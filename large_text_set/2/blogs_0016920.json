Then you melt a load of milk chocolate and dip your brownie ball in it before covering in sprinkles or cocoa powder.\nOnly spent about 5 hours making these yesterday… but today they actually seem worth it, because they're much better than we anticipated @_helz_x #ScotchCremeEgg #CremeEgg #Recipe #ScotchEgg #Homemade #Baking #CremeEggs #ScotchCremeEggs #Cadburys #Chocolate #MilkChocolate #Easter #OmNomNom #OmmNomm \nA post shared by Adam Phillips (@filps14) on Feb 28, 2016 at 11:51am PST \nSure, it’s probably like eating a ball of cholesterol but then it’s probably not that different to eating an actual, horrible Scotch Egg.\nAnd damn, they sure do look good.\nBe still, my already aching arteries.\nMORE: Important question: Is a Twix a chocolate bar or a biscuit? \nMORE: Chocolate crumpets now exist and breakfast will never be the same again \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:33:38.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
