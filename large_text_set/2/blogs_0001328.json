Stephenson, who illustrated Tory’s Love Relentlessly fragrance below, co-founded Vacation , a chic collection of easy, modern classics. We get to know her here. \nThe art bug bit when… I was three and took my first art class. \nMy very first art love… Is and always will be Michaël Borremans — at least my first real art love. He completely changed the way I viewed painting. \nFavorite subjects to paint… Women I admire and things I can’t afford. \nMy preferred medium/tools… Watercolor and very small brushes. \nWhen I get the artist equivalent of writer’s block… I listen to music and scour the internet for inspiration. \nAs an artist I could never be without… A strong point of view. \nFavorite creative to follow on Instagram… @noemiferst , hands down! She’s the sweetest, and even custom-ordered a book-cover painting for her daughter Gigi. Illustration by Meghann Stephenson The story behind my line, Vacation … My partner, Krys and I used to work together and one day we were commiserating over not being able to find a leather jacket that was high quality but still within our budget. We set out to design the perfect leather jacket that had a high level of craftsmanship, attention to detail and impeccable fit, offered at a price point currently not available for that level of quality in the market. Vacation evolved organically from there, adding pieces into our first collection that felt like necessary staples in any closet. Every piece is made in New York using the highest quality materials sourced from some of the best mills in the US and Japan. \nMy style is… Classic and comfortable, always some denim. \nAnd favorite fashion icons… I feel most connected to vintage references like Jane Birkin, Lauren Hutton, and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. They have such an ease with the way they dress and carry themselves, I always try to emulate that ease.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:19:31.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
