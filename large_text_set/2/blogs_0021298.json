I was captain of the team. I remember after this game I must go in the Europe with the national team. \n\"I didn't sleep for six days because it was a shock for me to lose the title. In another situation I won the title to recover against Inter eight points. We won the last game against Udinese and Inter lost the game against Lazio. \n\"The day after [everyone thought] we lost the title. I'm not surprised. I have experienced this. When I continue to repeat there are 13 games, there are 39 points. There is a long time before we can say we won the title. \n\"We must be focused, we must go step by step. Now I'm sure to win the title we must get 32 points [to be mathematically safe].\" \nJose Mourinho has been one of many top-flight managers to note Chelsea's advantage in regards to their lack of European football this season - with the now-Manchester United manager wary of his side's upcoming FA Cup game at Stamford Bridge being so close to his side's Europa League trip away to Russian side FC Rostov. \nAnd Conte admits that he has had to change his management style as a result of his increased time on the training pitch, without the worry of midweek games that European competition brings. \nChelsea plot bid for Atletico's Oblak \n\"I had both experiences, because in the first season with Juventus we didn't play Europa League or Champions League,\" he added. \"In the two years later we played. For sure you have to change something in the work, for sure.\" \n\"But it's important always to find the right balance and to understand when it's the right time to push, to work very hard, the time to rest. For sure you have to face these two situations in different ways.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:09:07.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
