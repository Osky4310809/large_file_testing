REUTERS/Joe Raedle/Pool Could Reince Be On His Way Out As Chief Of Staff? TOP 5477688 \nThe opening weeks of the Trump administration have been described as tumultuous by many, potentially leaving White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus’ head on the chopping block. \nChris Ruddy, founder of Newsmax Media and one of President Trump’s friends, said Sunday on CNN that the “White House is showing not the amount of order that we need to see. I think there’s a lot of weakness coming out of the chief of staff.” \nAfter these comments on CNN, Ruddy tweeted, “I’ve gotten three text messages from sitting Cabinet members praising my appearance. They realize this whole government depends on this chief of staff.” The significance of Ruddy’s comments are compounded by his tweet that he spoke at length with President Trump at Mar a Lago Saturday night. \nRuddy later spoke to The Washington Post on Sunday and continued to place blame on Priebus for the administration’s troubles. “It’s my view that Reince is the problem. I think on paper Reince looked good as the chief of staff — and Donald trusted him — but it’s pretty clear the guy is in way over his head,” Ruddy said. “He’s not knowledgeable of how federal agencies work, how the communications operations work. He botched this whole immigration rollout. This should’ve been a win for Donald, not two or three weeks of negative publicity.” \nA potential replacement for Priebus is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was the first major elected Republican to back Trump and previously headed the president’s transition team before being forced out by Jared Kushner. Like Ruddy, the New Jersey governor has called the roll out of Trump’s travel ban botched and placed blame on the president’s staff. \nChristie appeared on CNN Sunday and wouldn’t deny that he recently spoke to Trump on the phone. The New Jersey governor said that he would be open to joining the Trump administration, although he “intends” to join the private sector in a year after his time as term is over. \nRoger Stone, a Trump confidante, told The Daily Caller that he doesn’t think Christie will replace Priebus as chief of staff. Christie is reportedly scheduled to have lunch with Trump at the White House Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:19:29.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
