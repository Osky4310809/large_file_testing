Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nEarlier today, we told you about the new IAG low-cost carrier that it announced today called LEVEL . And as promised, the carrier is offering low-cost options to get between the West Coast and Barcelona. You can fly to the airline’s two US destinations, Los Angeles (LAX) and Oakland (OAK), to Barcelona (BCN) from $105 one-way. You can book through FlyLevel.com, which will redirect you to search for flights, select and book through Iberia’s website. These low fares are valid from June 2017 through January 2018 and will be operated on Airbus A330 aircraft.\nWhen trying to book this deal alert, it’s pricing out cheaper as two one-way flights instead of one round-trip ticket. On a couple sample fares, the two one-way tickets on the same dates generated a fare that was about $45 cheaper than if I were to book a round-trip ticket. We’re not sure if this is just a kink in the system that needs to be worked out because the airline is so new, so it’s worth checking both the one-way and round-trip options to be sure that the one-way ticket is still priced power.\nAirlines: LEVEL\nRoute: LAX and OAK to BCN\nCost: $254+ round-trip in economy\nDates: June 2017 – January 2018\nBooking Link: FlyLevel.com \nPay With: The Platinum Card from American Express ( 5x on airfare ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express , Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or Chase Sapphire Preferred (2x on travel)\nHere are a few examples of what you can book:\nLos Angeles (LAX) to Barcelona (BCN) for $254 round-trip in July: \n\nNote that this fare is booked as two separate one-way tickets. If you were to book the same itinerary on the same dates as a round-trip ticket, it would cost you $299 — 15% more than if you book the two one-way tickets.\nOakland (OAK) to Barcelona (BCN) for $254 round-trip in October: \n\nNote that this fare is booked as two separate one-way tickets. If you were to book the same itinerary on the same dates as a round-trip ticket, it would cost you $298 — 15% more than if you book the two one-way tickets.\nMaximize Your Purchase \nDon’t forget to use a credit card that earns additional points on airfare purchases, such as the American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold or Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (2x on all travel purchases).
