Liverpool rebound from their recent thrashing by Leicester with a convincing 3-1 victory of their own over Arsenal. Craig Burley cannot wrap his head around why Alexis Sanchez would sign a new deal as Arsenal are trending backwards. Liverpool rebound from their recent thrashing by Leicester with a convincing 3-1 victory of their own over Arsenal. Arsene Wenger discusses his decision to bench Alexis Sanchez, as well as what Arsenal's next step is for the season. Jurgen Klopp believes his side's inconsistency makes them the rollercoaster of the Premier League. \nIt is a dubious distinction, but currently, laying claim to the title of the \"biggest club never to win the Champions League\" is just about all Arsenal have got when it comes to asserting their credentials as a member of Europe's elite. \nThere may be arguments to contest that statement among supporters of Roma, Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico Madrid and Rangers, among others, but Arsenal's history, financial might, fan base and annual presence in the Champions League places them above all their rivals for the \"honour\" of being considered the best of the rest. \nAnd with Bayern Munich in town on Tuesday to complete the formality of their round-of-16 tie against Arsene Wenger's team, having run up a 5-1 advantage during last month's one-sided first-leg in the Allianz Arena, Arsenal will have to wait another year at least before attempting to shake off their unwanted status. \nHaving slipped out of the top four in the Premier League with a 3-1 defeat at Liverpool at the weekend, and with growing uncertainty over the future of star forward Alexis Sanchez (who was reportedly dropped after a training ground bust-up), Arsenal might not even be around to have their annual crack at the Champions League next season. Bayern need only avoid a 4-0 defeat to send the Gunners packing in the knockout stages once again. \nAt some point, however, Arsenal need to learn how to punch their weight in the Champions League because the same old story is becoming an embarrassment. \nTo be regarded as the biggest club never to win the Champions League might have its positives for those charged with sustaining the Arsenal money-making machine which has left over £100 million in cash reserves in the club's vault. Yet Atletico, with much smaller resources, have progressed to two Champions League finals in the last three seasons, while Italian champions Juventus made it to the final against Barcelona in 2015 despite the financial restraints of playing in 41,000-capacity stadium in a cash-strapped Serie A. \nNeither Atleti or Juve can compete with Arsenal's wealth, but both clubs are well-run and well-coached, with astute player recruitment teams that enable them to make up for their financial disadvantages against the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. \nArsenal and Wenger, meanwhile, really should have no excuses for their combined failures in the Champions League. The club has competed in the competition in every season since the turn of the century, but managed to reach just one final -- the 2006 defeat against Barcelona in Paris -- and have failed to go beyond the round-of-16 since 2009-10. \nBut just consider Arsenal's strengths and how poorly the club is playing its hand. \nThey remain London's biggest and best-supported club, despite Chelsea's rise over the past decade, and are second-only to Manchester United in terms of Premier League average attendances. \nOnly United (20) and Liverpool (18) have won more English titles than Arsenal (13) and only United have won as many FA Cups (12). And when it comes to signing players, they have the advantage of being a London club -- a selling point which proved decisive when Sanchez rejected Liverpool in favour of a £35 million move to the Emirates from Barcelona in 2014. Arsenal have all the tools at their disposal to be a success in Europe, and fans are getting tired of their failures. \nBut Arsenal somehow allow themselves to under-play their strengths. \nChelsea have been much more successful in exploiting their London location than Arsenal, while Wenger has overseen a decade of under-spending, failing to capitalise on the club's status as one of England's traditional powerhouses at a time when Chelsea and Manchester City raised the financial bar due to their immensely wealthy owners. \nQuite simply, Arsenal have allowed themselves to drift and the blame for that must be shared equally by Wenger, chief executive Ivan Gazidis and owner Stan Kroenke. Between them, the three men have settled on the bare minimum -- top four finish and progression to the Champions League knockouts -- as being satisfactory, but the chickens are now coming home to roost. \nAn unfulfilled Sanchez is projecting the image of a player who is already contemplating his next destination; Wenger is seeing his reputation eroded with every failure and the supporters are losing patience like never before. \nThe mood at the Emirates on Tuesday is likely to be vitriolic, with demonstrations planned by fans who have grown tired of the annual disappointment of falling short. But Arsenal only have themselves to blame. As a club, they have so much in their favour, yet they do not play to their strengths. \nLook back over the history of the Champions League and European Cup and their absence from the roll of honour is striking. The likes of Hamburg, Nottingham Forest, PSV Eindhoven, Aston Villa, Borussia Dortmund and Marseille have all had their names inscribed on the trophy, but Arsenal have come close only once. \nThat isn't good enough. Yet the concern for Arsenal fans is that there is no sign of their long wait ending anytime soon. \nMark Ogden is a senior football writer for ESPN FC.
