A Los Angeles psychic and her hoofed business partner want you to get back in the saddle.\nKate Neligan — who calls horse Lindsey her “spiritual teacher and best friend” — believes horses can teach humans lessons about confidence, teamwork and overcoming fear.\n“The programs I offer are one-on-one privates where people come and they pick a horse that they want to learn from and they work on whatever their intention is, whatever issue is going on in their life,” the equine-assisted life coach told The Post.\nSome of those unique programs — which cost $195 a pop — include yoga with horses and self-love, according to her Conscious Rockstar Coaching website.\nClient Dana met Kate at a restaurant waiting in line for the bathroom, and the next thing she knew, she found herself in a meditation session with Kate and Lindsey.\nShe was so thrilled with her first experience that she came back for a “table session” with Lindsey.\n“I laid down and Lindsey was basically my energy masseuse in a way. She physically would move my body very lightly or also work with me energetically,” Dana said, adding she felt an overwhelming sense of love coming from the horse.\nErinn, who met Kate at a “happy hour” for horses, sought out a session with Kate to overcome her childhood fear of the animals. Erinn feels as though the horse gave her courage and skills she can apply to her everyday life.\n“What the horse really taught me by the time I was brushing it and stroking it, is just because something is more powerful than you doesn’t mean that they will abuse their power. That transferred to my real life,” Erinn told The Post.\nKate’s favorite part of her job is watching clients rid themselves of negative emotions and leave her arena feeling lighter and ready to face the challenges ahead.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": ["http://nyp.st/2ibiHPk", "http://www.consciousrockstar.com/"], "published": "2017-01-06T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T03:57:16.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
