That guy’s pick up line was by far the weirdest. Just acknowledging the race thing right outta the gate. This season is gonna be s awkward. That right there is just the tip of the ice berg. There’s gonna be a thousand moments that are a million times more awkward than that. I actually can’t wait. The awkwardness is going to be 99% of the fun. Seriously though, Nick could not have been shuffled off stage faster. ABC knew his season was a dud. So much so that they IMMEDIATELY started the next season of the Bachelorette in hopes that people would forget. Brutal season from Nick. Just brutal.
