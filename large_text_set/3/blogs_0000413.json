The gruesome attack was so bad, the woman’s face became detached from her skull. \nFollowing the attack, the woman was left with a “floating face,” a medical term typically used to describe a person’s face that has become detached from the bone structure holding it in place. \nNow, the woman is speaking out about how much damage her heartless attacker has done to her life. Rapist who left his victim with a 'floating face' after detaching her skin from her skull is jailed for 12 years https://t.co/Unjgtxeqf7 pic.twitter.com/FGdWbEYiAb \n— Daily Mail U.K. (@DailyMailUK) February 28, 2017 \nThe victim of the crime recently issued a heartbreaking statement, saying, \nIt’s ruined my life. I come across as a strong person. I’m not really. I’m looking at lots more operations, lots more time in the hospital. I’m in constant pain. I can’t eat properly. I have to eat soft food. I can’t chew anything at all. I can’t eat meat or even toast. I can’t open my mouth to yawn. \nThe woman goes on to say she’s “fed up with the pain” she suffers from following the repulsive attack. She also stated she isn’t comfortable leaving her own house because it feels like people are staring at her. \nAccording to Metro, Timothy Sapwell, a prosecutor, spoke about the woman’s injuries in great detail. Following a CT scan, it was discovered the woman had sustained “Le Fort Fractures.” \nWikipedia states this is a “classic trans-facial fracture of the midface, involving the maxillary bone and surrounding structures in either a horizontal, pyramidal or transverse direction.” \nSapwell stated, \nThe front of the face was completely detached from the skull and smashed in two. It’s described in medical terms as floating face. \nCourt documents state the woman’s injuries required a nearly 10-hour operation using bone grafts, metal plates and screws. \nWhile it will never be enough to give the victim her freedom and life back, Anthony Laine is currently serving 12 years in prison for the crime. \nJudge Daniel Pearce-Higgins has also issued “an indefinite sexual harm prevention order,” which prevents Laine from having any sort of contact with the victim of his senseless crime.
