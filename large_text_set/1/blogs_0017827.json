The victim ran home and reported the incident to his mother. The mother and son then reported it to deputies.\nSchool officials relayed the message to parents, many of whom said they were unnerved as they picked their kids up from school Wednesday afternoon.\nThe child described the suspect as a man with dark complexion, possibly African American, thin build and tattoos on his hands. The suspect was wearing a dark-colored jacket, pants and boots.\nInvestigators were looking for any possible witnesses, surveillance video or additional victims. There was no suspect vehicle description.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Orange County Sheriff’s Department Investigator Hernandez at 949-206-6194 or the department commander at 714-647-7000. Anonymous tips can be submitted to Orange County Crime Stoppers by calling 1-855-TIP-OCCS (1-855-847-6227).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T04:06:30.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
