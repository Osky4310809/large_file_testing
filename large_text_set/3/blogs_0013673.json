After Mario Balotelli's glowing start at Nice, Julien Laurens explains why things seem to be falling apart. \nMario Balotelli has vowed to not give anymore interviews after the way in which French media distorted a recent sit down with the Nice forward. \nIn a wide-ranging talk with French radio station RMC that covered a number of important topics including racism and his return to the Italian national team, it was Balotelli's perceived negative comments about PSG striker Edinson Cavani that made national headlines. \nAnd Balotelli took to Instagram on Thursday to slam the media's portrayal of his interview. A post shared by Mario Balotelli (@mb459) on Mar 16, 2017 at 10:35am PDT \n\"I spoke about amazing young players, I spoke about racism, I spoke about Italy, all those newspaper could get was about the Cavani story... you just ridiculous seriously...\" Balotelli wrote. \n\"Seriously don't ask me for interviews again... no one. Balotelli isn't a game, [he] is a person with [an] opinion so get your owns [sic] to judge on it. \n\"Really isn't the fact of another stupid lie story coming out that bothers me but the fact that I spoke about society real problem and all that they could get was that? \n\"That's why the society and new generation will grow weaker and weaker.\" \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:29:00.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
