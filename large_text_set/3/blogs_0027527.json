Elsa wasn’t even close to reaching the other side of the trench. \nThe male lion, meanwhile, remained lying in its position, no doubt unimpressed by the lioness’ antics. \nRELATED: Mischievous lioness sneaks up on lion and nearly scares it out of its skin; video \nA park spokesperson told El Manana Nacional that the lioness was uninjured, though it appeared to have a slight limp. \n“The lioness is fine; [it has] been taken out of the trench and there is no broken bone,” the spokesperson said. \nSerengeti Safari is a nature reserve that allows exotic animals to live in “conditions of freedom” and enables close-up views of the animals, according to Excelsior . Fortunately the trench is big enough to contain any would-be attacking lions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:07:19.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
