And the rise of microblogging platforms that allowed for easy-to-share text posts and video links enabled users to create the internet’s version of niche, community-specific celebrity. Black creative peoples, especially, have shown just how powerful the internet —and even more specifically, social media like Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and blogging platforms— can be for innovative career-building that changes the traditionalist ways that we think about food and new media . \nThe chefs, authors, and bloggers in the list below embody the numerous ways that food, and food culture, can be interpreted and shared beyond simple recipes. They also shed light on the intersections of the food world, Black entrepreneurs, and the internet. Each brings personal flare to the table: Some focus on making knowledge of food and technique accessible; some are hilarious; and others are uniquely inventive, while respecting the deep roots of cuisine.

Along with her team of friends, she decided to then launch a blog, Black Foodie, with the primary mandate to celebrate food across the Black Diaspora. Posts include text and step-by-step video recipes by the team and from the Black Foodie community. And there’s merch, like their Ethiopian and Eritrean cuisine-themed “Tibs & Kitfo & Awaze & Injera” tee , available for purchase.

Most recently, Black Foodie has expanded to YouTube , adding a vlog-style video component that follows Hagos as she samples food from restaurant after restaurant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:15:38.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
