He is a faithful God; the children are kicking and in good condition. \n“God has been faithful to my family; five children at a go is, indeed, a wonderful blessing to me and my wife. \n“It is not going to be easy taking care of the children; I am soliciting support from all well-meaning Nigerians, all my friends and well wishers,’’ he said. \nChief Medical Director of UCTH, Dr. Thomas Agan, said the development was a moment of joy for the couple because they had waited for so long to have a baby. \n“I am very excited to see one of my staff in a happy mood. The Lord has done it for them. Five children at a go is a very big blessing to the couple. \n“This is the first time in the history of the state that a woman is delivering five children at a go and all the babies are perfectly in good condition. \n“I am happy that the UCTH has also set a record of delivering five children safely from one mother. The quintuplets are weighing between 1.45kg and 1.75kg. They are currently in the Special Care Babies Unit of the hospital,” he said. \nEarlier, wife of the state governor, Dr. Linda Ayade, had visited the couple, saying that the quintuplets were a blessing to the state and Nigeria at large. \nDuring the visit, Ayade made a donation of N1m to the couple and another N500,000 to the medical experts who ensured their safe delivery. \nThe wife of the governor also donated an incubator machine to the hospital on behalf of the state government, with a view to enhancing the hospital’s service delivery. \nThe Commissioner for Health, Dr. Inyang Ashibong, commended the Obstetrics and Gynaecology team of the UCTH for their professionalism in ensuring the successful delivery of the babies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T17:35:35.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
