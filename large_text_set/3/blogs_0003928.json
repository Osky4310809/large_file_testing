On Monday’s PFT Live , Clarence E. Hill, Jr. of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram provided some excellent information and insight about the future of the team’s former franchise quarterback. \nHere are the highlights. \nFirst, Hill said that Romo won’t be traded to or sign with Washington. “That’s not happening,” Hill said. \nSecond, Hill reinforced the notion that Jones and Romo will have a wink-nod deal as to where he will or won’t go, if Romo eventually is cut. \nThird, Hill said the Cowboys at least for now are waiting for a trade offer to materialize, possibly from the Broncos or Texans, in the hopes that Romo would accept the deal. \nFourth, Hill said Jones told reporters recently that he already has spoken to Romo, and that Jones said he has gone over all scenarios with Romo, which would allow a decision to be made quickly if necessary. \nFifth, Hill believes Romo would be inclined to take a Greg Hardy-type contract that pays Romo based on the number of games he eventually plays. That could make it easier for a team like the Broncos or Texans to justify adding Romo. If he plays, he gets paid. If he doesn’t play, he doesn’t get paid. \nFor everything Clarence Hill had to say, check out the video. It’s fairly short but it is packed with quality content. If you ignore the parts where I was talking.

Just sayin’. blitzinc43 says: Mar 6, 2017 12:11 PM \nAs a close friend of the organization Tony should simply take on the backup/mentor role because a team poised to win a championship cannot hinge their season on the oft-injured QB without a viable backup option. tonyzendejas says: Mar 6, 2017 12:19 PM \nTrailing 21-20, the Cowboys were a field goal away from advancing to the next round of the 2007 NFL playoffs. All Tony Romo had to do was catch the snap. He didn’t and the Seahawks remarkably won the game.

He can stay and lose with the Cowboys or go and get hurt playing somewhere else.

Maybe he’s a nice guy but as far a player he has won nothing for Dallas.
