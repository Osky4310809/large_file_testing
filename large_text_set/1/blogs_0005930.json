After all, they make or break your look. If you've ever slicked on a statement lipstick, and suddenly felt like a million dollars, you'll know the power of the perfect pout. This is why you need to make sure that your lips look impeccable. Which is why we've brought to you the tools, tips, and tricks you need to get a stunning mouth. Start taking notes, ladies. Flake It Away \nIf you have chapped lips that can do with some TLC, then you are in need of some lip exfoliation. Massage a mixture of brown sugar and olive oil on your lips daily. If you don't have a scrub at hand, a disposable mascara wand works just as well at sloughing away dead skin and increasing the blood flow. Follow up with a hydrating lip mask to get the plumpest pout ever. Prime Your Lips \nIf your lips feel dry whenever you apply lipstick, then think about priming them. Make a lip primer your first step, and your lipstick won't settle into any cracks. Just apply it on your lips and let it set for a few minutes, and then swipe your favourite lip colour. DIY Lip Stain \nYou want a softer stain on your lips rather than a defined colour? Transform pigmented lip colour into a softer shade by applying it using a fluffy eyeshadow brush. Dip the brush into the end of your lipstick, and lightly buff into your lips. Or apply the colour on the centre of your lips, and smudge it out with a make-up sponge. Long Wear Lipstick \nArm yourself with tissue paper and some loose powder to fight colour fade. Press a sheet of tissue on top of your lips, after you are done applying your colour, then use a brush to dust a thin layer of loose, translucent powder. Finish with another layer of your lip colour, for optimum staying power. Plump Your Pout \nContrary to popular belief, you really don't need to visit a surgeon to get a Priyanka Chopra worthy pout. These lip plumpers from celebrity make-up artists can help you with a temporary plump pucker . Or just use a lip liner to fake fuller lips.
