The “ Criminal Minds ” alum will star in the network’s reboot of “S.W.A.T.,” Variety has learned. He will also serve as a producer on the pilot. Based on the movie of the same name, the pilot follows a locally born and bred S.W.A.T. lieutenant who is torn between loyalty to the streets and duty to his fellow officers when he’s tasked to run a highly-trained unit that’s the last stop for solving crimes in Los Angeles. Moore will play the lead lieutenant, Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson, who exudes calmness, but is always ready for action. He has all the ability to become a leader — he’s just not happy with the reason he just became one. Previously announced, the pilot will also star Stephanie Sigman , who will play Jessica, an ambitious and fastidious high-ranking S.W.A.T. member. The “S.W.A.T.” pilot was written by Aaron Thomas and will be directed by Justin Lin. Both will serve as executive producers with Shawn Ryan, Marney Hochman, Neal Moritz, Pavun Shetty and Danielle Woodrow. Sony Pictures Television and CBS Television Studios are producing the series, which is based on the 2003 film that starred Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez and Jeremy Renner. Moore starred on “Criminal Minds” at CBS since the show debuted in 2005, before departing the series at the end of the eleventh season last year. Insiders say there was tension on the procedural drama between Moore and former star Thomas Gibson , who was fired from the show for a series of contentious events, including a physical fight with a producer. Moore is repped by attorney Stephen Breimer at Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal Laviolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman.
