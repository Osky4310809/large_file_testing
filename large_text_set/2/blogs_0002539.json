“nationwide restraining order” that blocks Donald Trump’s immigration ban is a George W. Bush appointee who once provoked controversy by saying “black lives matter” from the bench. \nThe ruling came down from federal judge James Robart. CNN called the ruling a “significant setback” for Trump, whose executive order temporarily halted all immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries with records of terrorism activity. Here’s the crucial part of the judge’s order (see the full decision later in this story): Judge Robart in WA is not messing around. Still only temporary, but it's a restraining order pic.twitter.com/VYCbtc0xb8 \n— Naomi Clark (@metasynthie) February 4, 2017 \nThe White House called Robart’s ruling “outrageous” and said it would file for an emergency stay of the Robart decision. White House responds to judge's ruling on ban saying it \"intends to file an emergency stay of this outrageous order\" https://t.co/yXXinz2Vns pic.twitter.com/VQfJLRf9Kb \n— CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) February 4, 2017 \nWashington Attorney General Bob Ferguson sought the ruling; the plaintiffs were the states of Washington and Minnesota. Ferguson’s office said the judge granted “Ferguson’s request to immediately halt implementation of President Donald Trump’s Executive Order on immigration nationwide.” Ferguson is arguing, in part, that Trump’s executive order violates the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of Equal Protection. \nThe judge’s decision says he granted the temporary restraining order because the states are “likely to succeed on the merits of the claims;” were likely to “suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief;” and because “a TRO is in the public interest.” Robart will rule at a later point on whether to permanently stop the Trump order. \nThe judge’s ruling says the “states themselves are harmed by virtue of the damage that implementation of the Executive Order has inflicted upon the operations and missions of their public universities and other institutions of higher learning, as well as injury to the States’ operations, tax bases, and public funds.” The residents of the states are affected “adversely” in the areas of “employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom to travel,” the judge’s order says. \nTrump’s controversial ban, which has provoked protests around the country, also suffered a blow in Detroit, when a federal judge there, Bill Clinton nominee Victoria Roberts, ruled against part of it. In Boston, though, Trump’s order found support from judge Nathaniel Gorton, a George W. Bush nominee . The flurry of decisions comes on the heels of a New York judge/Barack Obama appointee granting an emergency stay of parts of Trump’s order. \nRobart’s decision has the most impact yet. \nWho is Robart? What’s his background? \nHere’s what you need to know: 1. Robart Was Nominated to the Bench by a Republican President & Now Has Senior Status The restraining order against Trump's EO was issued by Judge James Louis Robart, appointed by G.W.B. Shows that Trump is a true mad man. pic.twitter.com/MZH5or1ylf \n— Adam B. Bear (@democraticbear) February 4, 2017 \nRobart has been a federal judge since 2004, serving the Western District of Washington, according to his judicial biography. \nThe bio says Robart was nominated for appointment as a federal judge on December 11, 2003. Robart was confirmed by the Senate on June 17, 2004. \nAccording to Ballotpedia, Robart “joined the court in 2004 after being nominated by President George W. Bush. He assumed senior status on June 28, 2016.” \nAfter the judge’s order, at least one airline reportedly deleted its travel warning for passengers. American Airlines has just deleted the Travel Alert about Trump's Muslim Ban, following the WA federal judge, but United site still has it. pic.twitter.com/KrPYZ9O2FD \n— Rosental (@Rosental) February 4, 2017 \nBallotpedia reports that Robart’s nomination received a 99-0 positive vote in the U.S. Senate. 2. Robart Declared ‘Black Lives Matter’ in a Previous Hearing in Which He Ruled Against a Police Union Watch federal judge James Robart's #BlackLivesMatter declaration, plus his challenge to Seattle's police union. pic.twitter.com/UDgQl2XCiu \n— Ansel Herz (@Ansel) August 23, 2016 \nThe judge has provoked controversy before. According to the Seattle Times , Robart declared “black lives matter” in a court hearing last August in which he decided against a Seattle police union. \nThe Seattle newspaper reported that Robart was presiding over “a 2012 consent decree requiring the city to adopt reforms to address Department of Justice allegations of excessive force and biased policing.” He “called for major changes that would directly affect the union’s membership: streamlined appeals of officer discipline and internal investigations conducted by civilians rather than sworn officers,” the newspaper reported. \nAt the end of the hearing, according to the Seattle Times, Judge Robart then became “deeply personal,” noting “a statistic that showed, nationally, 41 percent of the shootings by police were of blacks, when they represented 20 percent of the population” and referencing high-profile police shootings. \nYou can watch the video above; in it, the judge grows emotional, shaking his head and sighing. \nBefore becoming a federal judge, Robart had spent his career in private law practice. According to his judicial bio, Robart was a lawyer from 1973 through 1996 with Lane Powell Moss & Miller. He was co-managing partner from 1997-2002 at Lane Powell Spears Lubersky, and managing partner there from 2003-2004. \nThe judge has a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center (1973), where he was administrative editor of the Georgetown Law Journal. He has a bachelor’s degree from Whitman College. \nIn another police-related case, according to Above the Law, Robart doubled the city payout to people whose dog was tasered by the police, accusing the city lawyers of “terrible writing” and denying the city lawyer’s claim the people were “persecuted.” He wrote, “The treatment of the Jews by the Pharaohs in ancient Egypt, that was a persecution. What Nazi Germany did in the Third Reich, that is a persecution.” \nHe also brought up “the expulsion of the Acadian people from Nova Scotia by the British; the treatment of the Aboriginal people in Australia; ethnic cleansing,” the site reported. 3. Robart’s Order Bans Federal Employees From Enacting Trump’s Executive Order President Donald Trump. \nThe Seattle Times reported that the attorney general had sought to invalidate key provisions of Trump’s executive order. \nThe judge’s ruling prohibits “federal employees from enforcing Trump’s order,” according to the Seattle Times, and Robart made it clear he meant his ruling to apply nationally. You can read Robart’s order here: \nThe judge stressed that he was aware that “the work of the Judiciary, and this court, is limited to ensuring that the actions taken by the other two branches comport with our country’s laws, and more importantly, our Constitution.” \nFerguson, the state attorney general, declared, “The Constitution prevailed today,” the newspaper reported. See the AG’s lawsuit here: \nAccording to the release from Ferguson, the stoppage is temporary – at least for now. “The Temporary Restraining Order will remain in place until…Robart considers the Attorney General’s lawsuit challenging key provisions of the President’s order as illegal and unconstitutional. If Ferguson prevails, the Executive Order would be permanently invalidated nationwide,” the release said. 4. The Judge Is Involved in Community Volunteerism & Numerous Legal Committees Let's Show Respect For Our New Hero, Judge James Robart, Who Just Temporarily Blocked President Trump’s Travel Ban Nationwide!! \n— Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) February 4, 2017 \nAccording to his biography, Robart serves as chair of the Board of Trustees and former chair for the Board of Overseers for Whitman College. The judge was born in Seattle, Washington in 1947. Reaction on Twitter to his ruling on the immigration ban was divisive, with people breaking down into the predictable polarized camps (see above tweet). \nHe’s also former president and trustee for Seattle Children’s Home; former co-chair of the Second Century Society; he has served on the Children’s Home Society of Washington; and he was on the State Advisory Board and served as a former trustee for Children’s Home Society of Washington. \nRobart also serves on a number of legal oriented committees. They include: Member, Ninth Circuit IT Committee, 2007-2009; Ninth Circuit Advisory Board, 2002-2005; Lawyer Representative, Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference, 1993-1995; Board of Governors, Federal Circuit Bar Association, 1985-1986; Organizing Committee, Federal Circuit Bar Association, 1983-1984; Fellow, American College of Trial Lawyers; Fellow, American Bar Foundation Member; and Ninth Judicial Circuit Historical Society. 5. Other Judges Have Ruled on the Immigration Ban, Coming to Different Conclusions People attend an afternoon rally in Battery Park to protest U.S. President Donald Trump’s new immigration policies on January 29, 2017 in New York City. (Getty) \nOne ruling came down from a federal judge, Victoria Roberts, in Detroit. According to the Detroit News , Roberts “issued a permanent court order that ensures protections for U.S. residents traveling to and from the United States.” She issued a restraining order protecting green card holders, the newspaper said, even though Trump’s administration said, after initial confusion, that his ban doesn’t apply to them. \nThe newspaper said the plaintiffs in the Detroit case are “an immigrant who was issued a visa to enter the United States as a lawful permanent resident, a U.S. citizen whose nine-year-old son was denied a visa to join his family in the United States and the Arab American Civil Rights League.” Bubba Clinton appointed US Judge Victoria Roberts who blocked Trump immigration ban. pic.twitter.com/GHKvstxpwX \n— LoneStar (@Lonestar357) February 3, 2017 \nIn Boston, Judge Nathaniel Gorton “refused to extend a temporary order that allowed some people affected by Trump’s ban to enter the country,” reported USA Today. \nA New York judge previously issued an emergency stay requiring that the government not send people detained at airports back to their home countries.
