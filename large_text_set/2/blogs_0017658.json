But did they also nail the 2017 F1 spec? Here’s the most anticipated new F1 car of 2017, complete with the name of a vacuum cleaner: the Mercedes W08 EQ Power+. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nMercedes revealed its newest, shiniest Silver Arrow at Silverstone today, letting drivers Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton take it out on track. Only 17 percent of the components on the car were carried over from last year’s Mercedes W07, according to the team. \n\n\n“EQ Power+” refers to the new M08 EQ Power+ power unit—the all-new fourth iteration of Mercedes’ all-conquering turbo V6 hybrid, which Mercedes says was built to withstand more intense physical loads and a more severe duty cycle than its predecessors. Cars are expected to spend 10 percent more time at full throttle this year, and Mercedes doesn’t want to have another round of unexpected failures like those suffered by Lewis Hamilton throughout 2016.\n\nAdvertisement \n\n“EQ” is Mercedes’ new brand buzzword for its electric cars, and stands for “electric intelligence,” because “intelligence” starts with the letter Q. You’ll see this name popping up soon on all of Mercedes’ plug-in hybrid road cars. Flowing lines of electric blue have been worked into the W08's livery accordingly. \n\n\nPhoto credit: Mercedes By now, the features common on 2017-spec F1 cars are starting to feel familiar: a hyper-complex front wing, wider tires, lots of curious aerodynamic forms on the barge boards in front of the sidepods, and rear wing uprights that are angled back ever so slightly. \n\nMercedes’ vestigial shark fin is more of a subtle mohawk on the top of its engine cover, standing in sharp contrast to the meat cleaver attached to the top of Force India’s new car . \n\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:17:18.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
