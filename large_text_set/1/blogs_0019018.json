That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.\" \nActually, 2013 was the first time a special floor covering was installed to protect the grass on the National Mall. The Washington Post reported shortly before the second Obama inauguration that officials placed “several acres of a special plastic flooring.” \nGetty Images includes in its archives an image of workers laying the flooring just ahead of Obama’s swearing-in that year. And other reporters dredged up their own photos from 2013 that revealed the protective covering. \n2. \"All of this space [from Trump’s platform to the Washington Monument] was full when the president took the Oath of Office.\" \nThis photograph , taken during Trump’s inaugural address and published by CNN, shows considerable crowd gaps between the Capitol and the Washington Monument on the National Mall. To believe the area was full when Trump took the oath, one would have to believe the watchers left en masse in the minutes between the oath and the speech. \n3. \"We know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama's last inaugural.\" \nOn Friday, the D.C. Metro published ridership statistics for the past four inauguration days. The figures go up until 11 a.m., presumably on the assumption that riders using the system after that are unlikely to be attending the noon-time ceremony. \nSpicer is correct that, per Metro, there were 317,000 trips taken before 11 a.m. in 2013, “President Obama’s last inaugural.” But by that metric, the 2017 figure would be 193,000 — less than half of the 420,000 Spicer claimed. By Matthew Nussbaum \nIn terms of full-day ridership, Metro told the Washington Post that riders took 570,557 trips Friday. But by that metric, Spicer is wrong about Inauguration Day 2013, when there were 782,000 trips taken. On Inauguration Day 2009, per the Post , that figure hit 1.1 million. \n4. \"This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe.\" \nWhile the new administration disputes the count, the visual evidence from overhead photography is overwhelming: Far more people stood on the Mall and witnessed Obama’s inauguration in 2009 than Trump’s inauguration on Friday. \nThe global viewing audience is nearly impossible to calculate, but at least four previous presidents drew bigger domestic TV audiences than Trump. According to Nielsen ratings , 30.6 million viewers tuned in across 12 networks to watch Trump’s inauguration. That falls well short of the 41.8 million viewers who watched Ronald Reagan’s 1981 inauguration, the 37.7 million who watched Obama’s 2009 inauguration, the 34.1 million who watched Jimmy Carter’s 1977 inauguration and the 33 million who watched Richard Nixon’s 1973 inauguration. \nMillions of viewers also tuned in for livestreams of Trump’s inauguration, and CNN says that there were 16.9 million livestreams on its site and apps across the day. But Obama’s 2009 inauguration drew then-record online audiences, with CNN reporting more than 25 million livestreams across the day — and so much demand during Obama’s speech that many viewers were shunted to online waiting rooms.
