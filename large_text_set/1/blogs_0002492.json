We see a lot of Jamie’s story, and what he has gone through in 20 years. We see a bit of Claire and Frank, Claire and Brianna, and you see a bit of Claire as a professional doctor, surgeon. It’s just so different.” \nBut don’t worry, fans of Jamie (Sam Heughan) and Claire (Balfe). There will be a payoff after Season 2 that separated the lovers across time once again.

It’s very interesting, it’s like, how do two people come together after not seeing each other for 20 years, after both believing each other have died, and how do you build something real again?” \nBalfe, who is nominated for a Golden Globe this Sunday for her role on “Outlander,” also revealed who she’s bringing to the show, whether Heughan will also be in attendance, and which other ladies in her category she’s rooting for. \n“Outlander” Season 3 is currently in production. \nRead original story ‘Outlander’ Star Caitriona Balfe Teases Season 3: ‘There Will Be a Reunion’ (Exclusive Video) At TheWrap  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T20:19:56.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
