Guillaume CHANSON/Getty Images 8. Bikaner \nThe delightful desert town of Bikaner receives less tourists than many other prominent destinations in Rajasthan. It's a less-commercialized place to go on a camel safari, as an alternative to Jaisalmer. The main attractions are the atmospheric walled Old City and fort. Bikaner is also renowned for the infamous Karni Mata rat temple nearby. The Karni Mata Festival , held to worship the rats there, is one of the quirkiest festivals in India. A Camel Fair is also held in Bikaner every January. Painting inside Bundi Palace. traveler1116/Getty Images 9. Bundi \nAlthough increasingly popular with travelers, Bundi also often gets overlooked as a tourist destination in Rajasthan. Yet, it's a captivating place to visit, with its lakes, markets, temples, and blue houses similar to Jodhpur. This relatively laid back town is dominated by the extraordinary and imposing Bundi Palace, which protrudes out of the hillside. The ancient, winding lanes of the Old City are fascinating to wander through. Bundi also has around 60 step wells and a ramshackle fort above the palace. The Folk Tales specializes in rural travel and offers an interesting Rustic Charms of Bundi Itinerary. Christopher Pillitz/Getty Images. 10. Rural Rajasthan \nRural tourism is growing in Rajasthan, with Bishnoi and Pali becoming sought after destinations for getting off the beaten track. Bishnoi is a community of nature worshipers around 45 minutes from Jodhpur and can be covered in a day trip, while Pali is a bit further out and needs at least an overnight stay. Bishnoi Village Safari organizes trips and also accommodations. You'll find village life to be fascinating. You can even attend a shepherds' morning opium meet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:31.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
