By the time the Supreme Court issued its decision in 1973, her child had already been born and adopted. \nHer entire case had been based on lies built upon lies. It was all a sham — one that has done immeasurable damage to American society. \nBy the time of McCorvey’s death last week at the age of 69, she had already realized these things, of course, but by then it was too late — her name, her life and her suffering had already all been co-opted by the cold-hearted butchers of the left to serve as their inspiration. \nPlease share this story on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about the extraordinary change of heart “Jane Roe” of Roe v. Wade underwent prior to her death. What do you think of Norma McCorvey's change of heart? Scroll down to comment below!
