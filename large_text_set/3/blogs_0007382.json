It's a great league and fantastic football is played in it. I know it really, really well. \n\"But I wouldn't say it is top of my wishlist. \n\"Top of my wishlist is to play for a club who wants me to be their goalkeeper.\" \nHart claims that being axed by Guardiola was not a surprise to him. \nHe claims that he could sense something was not working out when the former Barcelona boss took over last summer.

You do not have that time, especially as a goalkeeper. \n\"You can't come off the bench for 10 minutes and prove your worth - you're either in or you're out. \n\"I'm all up for a fight. I'll fight my corner all day. But if you're not going to win, there is no point in fighting, especially with someone as powerful as that at Manchester City. \n\"It's nothing personal on me.
