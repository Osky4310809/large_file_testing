Ocean had previously said he would not attend this year’s Grammy Award show and opted not to submit his critically acclaimed album Blonde for Grammy consideration. \n“We all die one day and you’re old so fuck it,” Ocean wrote in his post, before sarcastically thanking them for reminding everyone of his 2013 performance, which he called “absolute shit.” \nHe also challenged their suggestion that he would skip the awards because of that misfire, saying, “Don’t you think I would’ve wanted to play the show to ‘redeem’ myself if I felt that way? In reality, I actually wanted to participate in honoring Prince on the show but then I figured my best tribute to that man’s legacy would be to continue to be myself out here and to be successful. Winning a TV award doesn’t christen me successful…. I am young, black, gifted and independent.. that’s my tribute.” \nOcean also dragged Swift and The Recording Academy’s selection last year of her album 1989 over Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly for the show’s album of the year prize. \n“I’ve actually been tuning into CBS around this time of year for a while to see who gets the top honor and you know what’s really not ‘great TV’ guys? 1989 getting album of the year over To Pimp a Butterfly . Hands down one of the most ‘faulty’ TV moments I’ve seen,” he wrote. \nOcean continued, “Believe the people. Believe the ones who’d rather watch select performances from your program on YouTube the day after because your show puts them to sleep. Use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, I’m one of the best alive. And if you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I’m all for it.” \nRead his full post here .
