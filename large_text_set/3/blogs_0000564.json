For the promotions for her movie Badrinath Ki Dulhania, Ami Patel styles her in flaming red pants with a matching scarf-top from The Koncept Store by KREA. \nWe love the vibe this outfit gives off… It’s laid-back, casual yet has a touch of a formal, business-y side to it. Keeping the look mellow and not OTT , she just adds a pair of strappy gold heels. \nHer makeup included subtle hints of red shadow around the eye with pink lips. And her hair was styled in waves giving the look a very easy and effortless feel. \nHow’s your OOTD?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:36:06.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
