I’m not concerned about this because every decision that you have to take for him must be always a good decision for him, for me and for the club,\" Conte said at Cobham Training Centre. \n\"I don’t think if he plays on Sunday or he won’t play on Sunday it can change the decision about him, also because I repeat: We are working very hard with him. Then it’s important to make the best decision for him, always.\" \nMeanwhile, some reports have suggested that Conte may loan Batshuayi to another club in January to sign Swansea City striker, Fernando Llorente. Conte didn't shed much light on his transfer policy but made it clear that he wants Batshuayi to stay put for the rest of the season. \n\"Now I’d like to keep all the players because I think we are building the right spirit with these players. It’s important to continue and to improve on the pitch, outside to keep this spirit very good between us. \n\"Now it’s important for him to be concentrated on Sunday’s game. It’s important to see the present and not too far [in the future], to be focused, to play very well and to show me that now he’s [adapted] to our idea of football. \nMan Utd fans claim Griezmann is a done deal \n\"We’ll find the right solution to implement in our squad, for sure we’ll go into the market. If there won’t be this possibility, we stay with these players. These players show me that now we are top of the table. We know it will be very difficult to keep this position, but if we want we can.\" \nGoal understands that several clubs in Italy and England are monitoring Batshuayi's situation, while Marseille would also be interested in seeing him return, as hope to see Conte change his mind and make him available for a loan move.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:47:53.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
