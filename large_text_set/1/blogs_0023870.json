He said his brother’s wife and seven children were detained even though they had approved visas. \n“They placed them in isloation in a small room and treated them as criminals or as people who may have committed a crime,” he said. \nSaleh’s faith was restored when two federal judges issued temporary stays on the on the executive order. He disagrees with President Trump’s belief that it will protect the country from terrorism. \n“If a 6-year-old and a 7-year-old is a terrorist just because they came from Yemen, where is the humanity?” \nRepublican Congressman Tim Murphy told KDKA government agencies must verify that immigrants are who they say are where they come from. \n“We know that many people that flooded into Europe didnt have documents had false documents, we know that ISIS was intentionally working on forging documents for people,” he said. “Our first and main goal is the safety and security of the American people that means some many experience inconvenience for a while.” \nMayor Bill Peduto was there, along with City Councilman Dan Gillman.
