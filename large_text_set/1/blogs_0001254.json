For some, it was a family affair, like Behati Prinsloo who quietly rang in 2017 with her musician husband, Adam Levine. There was also supermodel Cindy Crawford and her genetically blessed offspring, Presley and Kaia, who went the classic route, tipping their hats to the countdown in plastic toppers. \nVictoria’s Secret Angels also had quite the night. Taylor Hill donned “2017” sunglasses in a slip dress, while Joan Smalls, model Doutzen Kroes, and Smalls’s sister Erika beamed in “Happy New Year” tiaras. BFFs Martha Hunt and Lily Aldridge gave their celebrations a Western flair: The duo enjoyed an evening of line dancing. And speaking of the Aldridge clan, Ruby Aldridge sought out a pretty stellar 2016 send-off, too. Where Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid riffed on last year’s lingerie trend for their NYE looks , Aldridge put the slinky concept into full barely there force, wearing a lingerie set, along with a glittering choker and a fur chubby, in a casino no less. \nAll glitz and glamour aside, the award for most relatable New Year’s celebration goes to Carolyn Murphy. Wearing a cozy jacket and holding some spiritual reading, Murphy captioned her Instagram: “Way of the peaceful warrior, a weekend in solitude and filled with nothing but gratitude. Here’s to a magical 2017. Happy New Year everyone.” A sentiment we can surely all get behind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:44:46.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
