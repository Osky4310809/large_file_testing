I hate you especially. \n\"But the fact is we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It's vital.\" Senator John McCain likened Trump to a dictator over his attempts to suppress freedom of the press (Photo: REUTERS) McCain admitted he 'hates' the press 'especially Chuck Todd' (Photo: NBCUniversal) \nThe international order established after World War Two was built in part on a free press, McCain said in an excerpt of an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\". \nHe continued: \"I'm very serious now - if you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and, many times, adversarial press. \n\"And without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That's how dictators get started. \n\"They get started by suppressing free press. In other words, a consolidation of power. When you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press. \n\"And I'm not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator.

Apparently this is how they retaliate when you report facts they don’t like. We’ll keep reporting regardless.” \nBen Smith, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News, said in a statement: \"While we strongly object to the White House's apparent attempt to punish news outlets whose coverage it does not like, we won't let these latest antics distract us from continuing to cover this administration fairly and aggressively.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:24:40.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
