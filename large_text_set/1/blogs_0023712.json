She recited a poem entitled “I’m a Nasty Woman,” written by 19-year-old Nina Donovan of Franklin, Tennessee, US Weekly reported.\nThe poem was inspired by the moment Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a \"nasty woman\"  during a presidential debate. It took several jabs at the new president of the United States, and referenced the leaked 2005 Access Hollywood tape where Donald Trump bragged about grabbing women \"by the p*ssy\" without their permission.\nAshley said:\nI am a nasty woman. Not as nasty as a man who looks like he bathes in Cheeto dust, a man whose words are a dis to America, Electoral College–sanctioned hate speech contaminating this national anthem. I'm not as nasty as Confederate flags being tattooed across my city. Maybe the South actually is going to rise again, maybe for some, it never really fell. Blacks are still in shackles and graves just for being black. Slavery has been reinterpreted as the prison system, in front of people who see melanin as animal skin.\nOur p--sies ain't for grabbing, they're for reminding you that our walls are stronger than America's ever will be. They're for birthing new generations of filthy, vulgar, bossy, brave, proud, nasty women.\nWynonna, 52, was asked about her little sister's speech. She tweeted: \"I try to stay away from that toxicity. . . the whole thing is toxic. I'm not giving her all the credit. She doesn't have that kind of power.\"\n\n\"A reminder for people visiting my site. For me it's about love of [music] & fellowship with fans,\" Wynonna added. \"I don't do politics on here.\"\nSeveral fans responded to Wynonna's tweets, prompting the country music singer to further explain.\n\"I would not bash my sister ever,\" Wynonna clarified.\n\"I love how so many are telling me what I should or should not be doing about my relationship w/ my sister,\" Wynonna tweeted on Jan. 23. \"Wow.\"\n\"Last time I saw my sister we hugged,\" she continued. \"And, in our family we agree to disagree and we support WHO we are. Anyone else relate?\"\n\"(1) I will not defend what doesn't need defending, (God knows my heart & my family does too), & (2) I am not my sister's keeper. The end,\" Wynonna concluded.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T16:58:44.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
