The #Facebook and #Messenger #apps have collectively drained 20% of my battery in less than 4 hours despite not using the apps #mobile\n— Stephen Mann (@stephenmann) January 10, 2017\nFacebook and Facebook messenger have gotten obsene with their battery consumption, and have thus uninstall them\n— Thomas Smith (@TSHSmith) January 10, 2017\nDavid Marcus, vice president of messaging products on Facebook, acknowledged the problem on Twitter Monday and said it had been fixed on Messenger. He didn't weigh in on complaints about the core Facebook app, however.\n@bestsportnascar @alxpap issue was isolated and fixed server side. If you restart Messenger the problem should be gone now. Very sorry.\n— David Marcus (@davidmarcus) January 10, 2017\nIf you're experiencing the glitch, simply restart your Messenger app. The problem was related to an issue with Facebook's servers, Marcus said, so no app update is required.\nMarcus also advised that anyone using the beta version of the apps switch to the normal version for a better experience.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/818856070982402048", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Facebook?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/mobile?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/stephenmann/status/818874525727227910", "https://twitter.com/alxpap", "https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/818908229585420288", "https://twitter.com/bestsportnascar", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Messenger?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/TSHSmith/status/818799792759271424", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/apps?src=hash"], "published": "2017-01-12T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T18:30:50.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
