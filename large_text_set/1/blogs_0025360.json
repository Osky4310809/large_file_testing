Jason Cipriani/CNET \nBy Monday afternoon Pacific, Lyft had moved into the No. 4 spot in the top free apps list on Apple's App Store. Apple App Store/Screenshot by CNET \nPresident Donald Trump and his executive order temporarily barring immigration from seven countries could be inadvertently causing a ride-hailing war. \nAs support mounts for a campaign to get Uber users to delete their accounts , rival Lyft appears to be surging in popularity. By Monday afternoon Pacific, Lyft had taken the fourth spot in the top free apps list on Apple's App Store. On Saturday, it was No. 39, according to TechCrunch . Uber is currently No. 13. \nApple ranks apps by how many people are downloading them in a certain time period. So Lyft's ascent from No. 39 to No. 4 in two days appears to be correlated with the so-called #DeleteUber social media campaign. \nThe campaign picked up steam over the weekend after a series of events appeared to have caused a public relations storm for Uber. As tech industry heavyweights slammed Trump's immigration ban , Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who serves on a strategic forum of business leaders advising Trump , issued a statement on Facebook that was seen as only lightly critical. And then Uber halted surge pricing during a taxi strike aligned with protests at New York's JFK airport, which was seen as both breaking the strike and profiting off the demonstrations. \nThe #DeleteUber hashtag , which is still trending on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, has the backing of celebrities like Lena Dunham , George Takei and Susan Sarandon . \nThe 90-day immigration ban, signed by Trump via an executive order on Friday, bars travel to the US for people from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. A federal judge temporarily halted the ban on Saturday, but many individuals and families who were enroute to the US are still reportedly stranded at borders and in airports worldwide.
