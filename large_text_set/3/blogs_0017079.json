One character assumes she's talking about \"boyfriend problems\" before realizing she's actually referring to \"girlfriend problems.\"\nSpeaking to the publication, director Dean Israelite described the scene as a \"pivotal\" one that ties into the film's overall themes:\nFor Trini, really she's questioning a lot about who she is. She hasn't fully figured it out yet. I think what's great about that scene and what that scene propels for the rest of the movie is, 'That's OK.'
