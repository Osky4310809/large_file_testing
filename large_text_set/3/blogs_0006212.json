Why not (Picture: CNN) Commenting on the taste of the brain, Aslan joked: ‘Want to know what a dead guy’s brain tastes like? Charcoal.\n‘It was burnt to a crisp!’\nMaybe you should have sent it back and asked for medium-rare?\nAslan waits for his meal (Picture: CNN) Complaining only got him into deep water with one of the less friendly nomads, who told him (through mouthfuls of poo): ‘I will cut your head off if you keep talking so much.’\nThe man then angrily threw his own faeces at Aslan and his crew, who swiftly moved out of the way.\nAslan, right, gets a telling off (Picture: CNN) Aslan, who’s a Muslim, admitted to being shocked at the behaviour of the sect of Hindu nomads in India called the Aghori, who he was visiting in Varanasi, India for an episode of the programme.\nHe told viewers: ‘I feel like this may have been a mistake.’\nMore: TV ITV's hotel drama The Halcyon has been axed after just one series \n14 reasons why we still love Buffy The Vampire Slayer \nJames' rage as he discovers Scott has been stealing from him in Hollyoaks \nThe Aghori reject the Hindu caste system and believe the human body cannot be tainted, and Hindu viewers are not happy that their religion has been linked to their culture on TV.\nThe rather unpalatable episode features in Believer (Picture: CNN) Trump-supporting business magnate Shalabh Kumar has called the show a ‘disgusting attack on Hinduism’ online.\nBut Aslan hit back on Twitter: ‘This is a show about the Aghori not Hinduism.’\nAslan is one brave motherflipper (Picture: Getty) Viewers were rather startled. Watching #Believer … in a way the Aghori have a good philosophy… then they eat dead people, their own poo and such. That's weird.\n— not kenny friedman (@smonkyou) March 6, 2017 \n#RussiaGate \nMr. Prez, I have a tribe I'd like you to visit.
