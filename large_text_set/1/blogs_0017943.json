Source: AFP \nJurgen Klopp had said the “door is always open” for Gerrard to return in a coaching capacity, outlining the club wanted to help him transition into the new career if that was his preferred choice. \nGerrard will now work under the stewardship of academy director Alex Inglethorpe, who signed a multi-year contract with the Merseyside club in November.

Source: AFP \nInglethorpe believes there was only one place Gerrard wanted to be, despite a number of attractive offers from elsewhere. \n“If I was to pick one individual who embodies the characteristics and values we are looking to instil into our organisation at Kirkby it would be Steven Gerrard,” said Inglethorpe. “For him to have been so enthusiastic about being part of what we are looking to do is simply great news for everyone connected to the club. \n“I don’t think it would surprise anyone to know that Steven has had a host of great options, in terms of what to do next in his career, including playing, management and coaching. But it’s been evident from the first meeting with him that his heart and head belongs here. \n“He has shown great humility in making it clear from the outset he wants a role where he can contribute to Liverpool; it’s typical of him that his priority has been defining the role so it helps the club, ahead of himself. \n“He has expressed a desire to learn from us and manage a young team. The benefits to us will be immense. This is a substantial role and one which makes the Academy and the club in general stronger and better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:59:57.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
