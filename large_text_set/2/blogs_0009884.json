Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki \nHe urged the Chairman of the board, Prof. Ebegue Amadasun to put together all that was needed to equip the hospital so as to enable the state government achieve its plans in the health sector. \n“It cannot be medical tourism if most of these issues you have raised are not addressed. Some of were already known to government,” assuring that they would be addressed. \n“Our people voted for continuity and consolidation therefore they need the best and the governor is ready to meet their demands. \nEarlier, leader of the delegation and Chairman of hospital management board Prof. Ebegue Amadasun thanked the governor for finding time out of his busy schedules to receive members of the group, adding that the visit was to congratulate the governor on his well-deserved victory at the September 28, 2016 polls.
