(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) The Democrats are giddy about Republicans’ failed attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. They and their allies in the media hope to fake Republicans into believing that they can recruit the party’s less radical members to support a few key pieces of legislation. But the new-Left’s objective is not to reward Democrats for working with Republicans. Their goal is to resist. And the quickest way for a Democrat to be challenged in a primary is if they are labeled a Trump Democrat – a collaborator. The new-Left’s unyielding resistance will not quit and nothing is going to get easier for Republicans.\nUntil recently, Democrats have done what they could with procedural delays and pointless posturing during confirmation hearings. But Republicans stuck together, outlasting the Democrats’ opposition. And now, they have a nearly full Cabinet to show for it. However, with the Freedom Caucus doing what the Democrats couldn’t in successfully blocking repeal-and-replace, some Republicans are rethinking how they are going to get legislation passed. Some are even muttering about the possibility of attracting Democrats. But Democrats today will never risk their seat to help Republicans, let alone President Trump.\nIf ever there were hope for a bipartisan initiative, it would be the Gorsuch nomination. Invoking cloture for Gorsuch should be easy, but it’s not happening. I thought it was a particularly bad sign when Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) announced he would filibuster Neil Gorsuch. Bill Nelson?! I’ve heard so little from him in recent years that I didn’t realize he was still a senator. It really says a lot when a lackluster senator from a red state is intimidated into a filibuster on a vote for someone who, by all accounts, is worthy of a seat on the Supreme Court. Somehow, just supporting an up-or-down vote on Gorsuch’s confirmation has become unacceptable to the Democrats’ base and liberal financial supporters. One can only imagine how those same activists will feel about a major pro-business tax overhaul.\nEventually Republicans will need a sliver of the Democrats’ support to advance anything of substance through Congress. And now, as the stage is being set for the battle over tax reform and infrastructure, nothing is going to get easier. The White House is saying the obligatory things about promoting bipartisan harmony, but what we really need is better organization by Republicans.\nTalking about bipartisanship is mandatory, but believing it will happen is a different story. Republicans simply cannot rely on Democrats for their support of the Trump administration’s agenda. The new-Left’s activists were first energized by Bernie Sanders, but with Trump’s election, they transformed from the loyal opposition to the bitter resistance. And they will give no quarter to any elected official who even thinks about falling in line with the president and Republicans in Congress.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@EdRogersDC", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-nelson-gorsuch-filibuster-20170327-story.html"], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:00:19.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
