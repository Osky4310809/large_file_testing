But in tonight's Legends of Tomorrow , we saw a glimpse of what the world might've been like if the franchise's creator, George Lucas , had not gone into filmmaking. \nThroughout tonight's action-packed midseason premiere, ' Raiders of the Lost Art ,' the show paid homage to the film franchise. We did our best to keep track of the various winks and nods to the iconic films. \nSo...what did we see? What did we miss? \nRead on, and comment below. \nLOST MEMORIES — When Damien Darhk (guest star Neal McDonough ) and Malcolm Merlyn (guest star John Barrowman ) try to capture Rip Hunter (Arthur Darvill) in 1967, they create an Aberration big enough to draw the attention of the Legends. However, when the team arrives they discover that Rip has no memories of his past due to “time drift” and is just a graduate film student. \nAfter trying to convince Rip of who he was, they discover that he possesses an incredibly powerful artifact known as the Spear of Destiny, which the Legion of Doom is after. Ray ( Brandon Routh ) and Nate ( Nick Zano ) realize that the Aberration has also affected them personally making it difficult to help the team. Meanwhile, Rory (Dominic Purcell) asks Stein ( Victor Garber ) for help and makes him promise to keep it a secret from the team. \nCaity Lotz , Franz Drameh and Maisie Richardson-Sellers also star. Dermott Downs directed the episode written by Keto Shimizu & Chris Fedak.
