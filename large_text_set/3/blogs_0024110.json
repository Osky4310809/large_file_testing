While he was still in China, it conducted a test of what it called a “revolutionary” new type of engine for its rockets. On Wednesday, it appears to have conducted more missile tests from the eastern port city of Wonsan, though they reportedly failed.\nTo be fair, Trump doesn’t really have a North Korea policy yet.\nTillerson stressed repeatedly that a comprehensive policy review is underway and that the purpose of his trip to Asia was to hear out the North’s neighbors. How much he was able to do that is questionable. South Korea has only an interim government these days, since its president was just forced out of office because of a scandal. China, North Korea’s economic lifeline, has a longstanding dialogue-based agenda that Washington is already familiar with but has never shown much interest in.\nOn the other hand, Tillerson did raise some eyebrows with a few tough-sounding warnings.\nWhile in Seoul, he said “everything was on the table,” including military intervention or even a pre-emptive strike if tougher sanctions or other diplomatic measures fail to achieve Washington’s goals.\nSome policy experts in the U.S. say that is really more smoke than fire.\n“If you look at Tillerson’s full statements, they were much more of a continuation of current policy than has been portrayed in the press, with an emphasis on expanding sanctions,” said David Wright, co-director and senior scientist of the Global Security Program for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “You can try to squeeze North Korea with more sanctions and maybe slow its program, but it’s hard to see how to stop it from moving ahead without diplomacy.”\nTillerson’s remarks are completely in line with longstanding U.S. policy, including Obama’s, but just stated more threateningly. President Bill Clinton, for example, is known to have seriously considered a pre-emptive strike over the nuclear issue in 1994.\nEven so, tone is important in diplomacy and Tillerson does seem to have reassured some in Seoul and Tokyo that the United States hasn’t forgotten them.\nPyongyang, however, seems to have hit the familiar bravado button.\n“The nuclear force of the DPRK is the treasured sword of justice and the most reliable war deterrence to defend the socialist motherland and the life of its people,” the official reportedly said. “If the businessmen-turned-U.S. authorities thought that they would frighten the DPRK, they would soon know that their method would not work.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:11:41.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
