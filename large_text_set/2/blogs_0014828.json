Presidential Photographers Division/Albert Alcain \n  Malacañang yesterday described as “character assassination” the claim of retired policeman Arturo Lascañas that President Duterte operated death squads and ordered the killing of criminals when he was still mayor of Davao City. \n“The demolition job against President Duterte continues,” Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in a statement. \n“The press conference of self-confessed hitman Senior Police Officer 3 Arthur Lascañas is part of a protracted political drama aimed (at destroying) the President and to topple his administration,” he added. \nAndanar said the character assassination against the President is nothing but vicious politics orchestrated by sectors affected by the reforms initiated by the Duterte administration. \n“Bringing change is not an easy task. The Duterte administration has disturbed and disrupted the establishment. However, we remain undistracted in delivering goods and services to serve the people, not just the interest of the few,” he said. \nAndanar said the Commission on Human Rights, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Senate committee on justice have cleared the President of involvement in extrajudicial killings.   \nChief presidential legal counsel Salvador Panelo described Lascañas’ claim as incredible. \n“It’s a continuing fabrication of stories against the alleged responsibility of the President on extrajudicial killings. Like (self-confessed hitman Edgar) Matobato, Lascañas is also giving another false narration,” Panelo said in an interview yesterday. \nPanelo also doubts Lascañas’ claim that Duterte gave him P3 million to kill radio commentator Jun Pala. \n“If you will notice, he was saying that P3 million was given to him by a Sonny Buenaventura, which means he has no direct links with the President, which means he has not talked with the President, which means he has not received anything from the President,” Panelo said. \n“So it’s hearsay. Even if we’re assuming it to be true, still the same conclusion. He has no direct communication with the President. In other words, all his allegations are false,” he added. \nMedia payoff \nIn a separate interview, Andanar claimed that money circulated during the press conference of Lascañas at the Senate yesterday. \n“I received reports that as much as $1,000 were distributed during this presscon. I won’t name my source but such huge amount was given so that it will be covered,” Andanar told CNN Philippines in Filipino. \nAndanar said he was informed that the opposition has allotted huge sums to topple the administration and peddle the story of Lascañas. \nIn a statement, Senate reporters assailed Andanar for making the “irresponsible and unsubstantiated claim.” \n“To our knowledge, no such incident occurred. Such practice is not tolerated among Senate reporters,” the Senate beat reporters said. \n“We would like to ask the secretary to prove his allegations as such statements placed our credibility and our respective media entities under a cloud of doubt,” they added. - With Edu Punay", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:30:02.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
