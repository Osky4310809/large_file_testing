But unlike Amazon, Stuart doesn’t have to contend with delivering goods from out of town warehouses or logistics hubs but is solely focusing on the last-mile and delivering goods from within a city. \nAlso of note, the startup offers multiple modes of transportation, from pushbikes, motorbikes to vans, so it can delivery different size packages. \nOperating in France, U.K., and Spain, the company says it facilitates “thousands” of deliveries per day for more than 500 customers, including Carrefour, Franprix, Burger King, The Kooples, Pizza Hut, and Cdiscount. \nIn July last year , Stuart also signed a partnership with Just Eat in France to let the take-out marketplace’s restaurant partners outsource delivery, although that doesn’t even get a mention in today’s accompanying press release, so make of that what you will. \nPaul-Marie Chavanne, GeoPost’s CEO, says in a statement: “This decision logically follows our investments in Stuart over the past 2 years. Stuart completes our delivery service at a local level and embodies the future of express urban delivery, a rapidly expanding strategic activity for us.” \nStuart founders Benoît and Chemla add: “We are extremely proud of the journey that we and our more than 100 employees have taken over the last two years. GeoPost’s acquisition will enable Stuart to maximise its potential and become the leading player in last mile delivery in Europe.” \nMeanwhile, GeoPost says the acquisition of Stuart will “cement” its position as a leading provider of express urban delivery throughout Europe. “Stuart adds the final piece in the delivery value chain formed by GeoPost subsidiaries Chronopost, DPD, SEUR and Pickup,” the French company notes. \nI’m also told that Stuart will remain an independent brand and GeoPost subsidiary, and that Damien Bon, COO at Stuart, is being promoted as CEO of Stuart. \nIn addition, Diego Magdelénat and Paul-Ambroise, the founders of Pickup, a startup specialising in alternative delivery which GeoPost acquired in 2009, will co-chair Stuart. \n“Stuart’s co-founders will ensure a smooth transition over the next few months,” says GeoPost, which, I also suspect is a coded way of saying they aren’t sticking around for too long post-acquisition. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T12:49:14.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
