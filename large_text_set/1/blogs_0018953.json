Sitting by the sea, the conversation fast turned to our dreams. There is something about the sea and the sunset, that totally makes you get in the zone. We all had a list of stuff we wanted to achieve, bar this one friend of mine, who said that she didn't really have a to-do list. We all, obviously, looked at her in surprise, but her justification was, \"this right here is what I wanted to do for months.\" I still remember that moment so clearly because each time I've sat by, waiting for the big things in life, after that conversation, I've reminded myself of her words and I've convinced myself to feel happy, right now ... in the moment. \nWe have big plans for our life, and we should too, and while wait patiently to achieve them, we forget to enjoy the little things. When you wait for a promotion in March, you most likely forget to appreciate the wonderful email you boss sent you this morning ... When you wait to go on a international vacation in December, you forget to appreciate all the hilarious moments where you forgot your stress without going on a holiday ... \nThere are always going to be bigger, seemingly better things to wait for, but the point is, you need to stop waiting and start living. Dealing with life with a positive attitude 24 X 7 X 365 might be a tad impossible (we are all humans after all), but instead of always wishing, and waiting for life to get better, why don't you accept the fact that life right now, just like this, is wonderful. \nThe smile a stranger gave you today, a lovely surprise text from a friend, a good word from the boss, a hug from your man ... little things that really lead up to the bigger things. Stop waiting for a vacation, a break or a big change to make life interesting. There are several everyday routine things that make you smile and all you need to do is appreciate them, and enjoy them. \nLook for things that make you happy, try to include them in your daily life as much as possible, appreciate them and see the difference. Enjoying the little things, and caring about them, will make the wait for the bigger things so much easier. Give it a try!
