Biracial baby twins Kalani and Jarani Dean were born to a Caucasian mother, Whitney Meyer, and African American father, Tomas Dean, about nine months ago. Unlike most children of interracial couples, however, one of the fraternal twins — Kalani — was born with a white complexion, while Jarani was born with darker skin.\n“When Kalani came out I thought she [had albinism] because she was all white. I asked my doctors, but they said, ‘Nope! And I kept thinking she would get color but she didn’t,” said Meyer in an interview today with Us Weekly . “It’s unusual.”\n& Like/share us please!! We're chromosome twins . Kalani(on left) is light with blue eyes and Jarani(on right) is the darker one with brown eyes. This is rare but so awesome to share!! How many likes can we get?\nNai-post ni Whitney Meyer noong  Miyerkules, Nobyembre 2, 2016 Estimates of how often this phenomenon occurs vary widely, with some estimates as low as 1 in 500 and others as high as 1 in a million . But regardless of how many other pairs like them are born, the Dean twins definitely win the award for “most viral.”\n& Local Quincy Il Biracial Twins!! One is white and one is mix! Really odd and neat!! Just wanted to share with our community!!!\nNai-post ni Whitney Meyer noong  Lunes, Enero 23, 2017 \nOn Facebook, a post shared by Meyer has garnered more than 2,300 likes, and Meyer has been interviewed by everyone from Us to People to her local ABC station .\nHer babies, says Meyer, are proof of “why racism shouldn’t exist.”\n“They are different colors, but sisters by blood,” she told People . “One is light and one is mixed, but we love them the same.” The twins were a huge blessing for Meyer and her partner, who lost their 2-year-old son Pravyn about two years ago in a terrible drowning incident. (Meyer also has an older son, Talan, from a previous relationship who she says is a wonderful big brother.)\n“It’s heartwarming, the response I’ve gotten to my biracial twins,” she said. “It restores my faith in humanity, at a time when I, when this country, really needs it.”\nWe’re rooting for your family, Whitney and Tomas!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T04:28:27.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
