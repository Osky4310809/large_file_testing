New shows include Love Connection , Beat Shazam , The F Word With Gordon Ramsay and Superhuman . Returning shows include Masterchef , American Grit and So You Think You Can Dance . \nOn May 25 at 8:00-9:00 PM ET/PT, we have the new unscripted series Love Connection . “Hosted by Emmy Award winner Andy Cohen ( Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen ) and executive-produced by Mike Fleiss ( The Bachelor ), the one-hour series amps up the original hit dating show for today’s audiences. Each hour episode will feature single men and/or women in search of romance, as Cohen brings his personal brand of audacious fun to the series.” \nAt 9:00-10:00 PM ET/PT, we have Beat Shazam . “Hosted by Grammy-, Golden Globe- and Academy Award-winning actor and musician Jamie Foxx (“Ray,” Django Unchained ) debuts at 9:00-10:00 PM ET/PT. Executive-produced by Mark Burnett ( Survivor , The Voice ) and Jeff Apploff ( Don’t Forget the Lyrics! ), the series pits teams of two against the clock and each other as they attempt to identify the biggest hit songs of all time. In the end, the team with the highest score will outlast the competition and go against Shazam, the world’s most popular song identification app, for the chance to win a cash prize. \nThe Summer TV premiere dates continue on May 31 when the new live series The F Word With Gordon Ramsay debuts after the season premiere of the returning series Masterchef . Masterchef will feature returning judges Ramsay, Christin Tosi, as well as new judge, but no stranger to cooking shows, Aarón Sánchez. The F Word With Gordon Ramsay “ debuts at 9:00-10:00 PM ET live/PT tape-delayed. Based on his hit U.K. series, each distinctive and fast-paced hour will combine good food and great cooking with Ramsay’s passion, energy and humor into a one-of-a-kind LIVE series. During each episode, teams of foodie families and friends will battle it out LIVE in a high-stakes cook-off, hoping to impress Ramsay, as well as celebrities, VIPs and other dinner guests. As the LIVE battle heats up, the show will feature Ramsay hosting highly stylized cooking demos and weekly out-of-the-kitchen adventures with fans, foodies and surprise guests. We’ll see Gordon at his best inside the kitchen, and at his most mischievous outside the kitchen. With Gordon LIVE, anything can happen!” \nOn Sunday, June 11 (9:00-10:00 PM ET/PT), the FOX summer TV schedule continues as WWE Superstar John Cena brings 17 new competitors to American Grit . Cena and “an elite group of military heroes will live alongside these people, all in search of a change, and take them under their wing as they lead them through a series of all-new epic team and individual challenges. In the end, only one competitor will win a quarter of a million dollars, but hopefully, all of them will find their Grit.” \nSo You Think You Can Dance returns with host Cat Deeley, as well as Mary Murphy and Nigel Lythgoe as judges in its 14th season on Monday, June 12 (8:00-9:00 PM ET/PT). ” \nHighly-skilled dancers between the ages of 18 and 30 will showcase their talents in various dance styles, including contemporary, tap, hip-hop, ballroom, animation, breaking and more. The Top 10 dancers will be paired up with All-Stars who will guide them throughout the competition as they vie for America’s votes and the title of America’s Favorite Dancer. An additional judge will be announced soon.” Right after that, we have Superhuman , hosted by Kal Penn with panelists Mike Tyson, Christina Milian and Dr. Rahul Jandial. “This jaw-dropping series of one-hour episodes tests the abilities of ordinary people to use their extraordinary skills to win a $50,000 grand prize. In each episode, five contestants who possess a distinct, nearly super-human ability in fields such as memory, hearing, taste, touch, smell, sight and more, are challenged to push their skills to the limit, yet only one will take home the title of SUPERHUMAN and the $50,000 grand prize. \nThe 2017 Miss USA pageant will air live on Sunday, May 14 (7:00-10:00 PM ET live/PT tape-delayed) to round out the Summer TV premiere dates.
