Lauderdale rampage, 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, was charged on Saturday with performing an act of violence at an airport, which could earn him the death penalty if he is convicted. \nSantiago was charged with an act of violence at an international airport resulting in death and weapons charges. \nEarlier, the FBI announced that Santiago apparently traveled to the airport for the purpose of carrying out the bloody rampage. \nSantiago told investigators that he planned the attack, buying a one-way ticket to the Fort Lauderdale airport, a federal complaint said. Authorities don’t know why he chose his target and have not ruled out terrorism. \nTerrorism may have been a “potential motivation” for the attack on Friday that killed five people, Special Agent in Charge George Piro said during a news conference. \nSantiago came up on the FBI’s radar when he went into an Anchorage, Alaska FBI office and said that he was being forced to fight for ISIS. \nThe FBI sent him for a mental evaluation and took away his gun. But because he had not committed a crime, when he was released, they gave him back his gun. \nAnchorage Police Chief Christopher Tolley could not say if it was the same gun that he used in the attack. \nSantiago previously served in Iraq, then later upon his return to the U.S., in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard. \nThe Pentagon said his record showed he went AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged. \nHis aunt said he had recently become a father and was struggling. \nHe also had a prior domestic violence case involving a conflict with his girlfriend. \nSantiago was charged in a domestic violence case in January 2016, damaging a door when he forced his way into a bathroom at his girlfriend’s Anchorage home. The woman told officers he yelled at her to leave, choked her and smacked her on the side of the head, according to charging documents. \nHopefully there will be a proper investigation into any possible terrorist connections. \nLet us hope that the victims and their families are able to get justice.
