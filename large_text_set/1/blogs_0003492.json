I’ve spoken to the Brazilian players – and a player from Brazil being bought by City is sure to have quality. \n“He will need time to adjust but I hope he can be that good and make an impact as soon as possible. We will help him to get to his full potential as soon as possible, because in football people want results. \n“It’s an exciting moment for him, for us and for the fans and we hope he can score many goals.” \nWatch — New boy Gabriel Jesus is no fan of the English winter weather: Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:45:36.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
