Sources close to the action say that this New Years Eve is the last night of service for Stephane Bombet and Kris Morningstar’s French-leaning, patio-loving space .\nA New Years Eve call to the restaurant confirms that Terrine will indeed be shuttering after tonight. That shouldn’t stop the revelry this evening, as the party is likely to be getting into full effect in time for the ball drop, but after that it’s so long.\nRumors have been swirling about Terrine’s impending closure for a while now, but as recently as two weeks ago Bombet denied the shutter was coming. Now it seems certain that one of LA’s best standby restaurants — at least for some — is heading for the scrap heap two years into its run.\nEater reached out to Bombet for official comment, but so far hasn’t heard back. The shutter marks the second for Bombet’s hospitality group in quick succession, as he also stepped out from the restaurant Viviane in Beverly Hills earlier this year.
