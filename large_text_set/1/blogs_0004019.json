The property has an open-space lounge with modern design features (Photo: ITV) \nAnother, who seemed rather shocked, added: \"Still not over Sid Owen's gaff on Through The Keyhole, lads.\" \nEven Strictly's Judge Rinder, who was a contestant on the show, admitted said Sid had a \"lovely house and a lot of taste\". \nIt wasn't just his houser that received praise. One viewer said: \"What a good sport Sid is. Never really rated him before ('cos I'd never really though about him) but wow. Lovely guy.\" Sid Owen's House on Through the Keyhole (Photo: ITV) Keith Lemon poses poolside at Sid's house on Through The Keyhole (Photo: ITV) \nSid is, of course famous for playing the long-suffering, docile Ricky Butcher in EastEnders between 1988 and 2012, although he briefly dabbled in the music industry by releasing Good Thing Going in 2000. \nHaving taken part in I'm A Celebrity in 2005 and coming in third place, he was a a contestant on 2012's Strictly Come Dancing, and was voted off in week five. \nMost recently, he took part in Celebrity Masterchef.
