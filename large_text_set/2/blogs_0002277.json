AFP PHOTO / POOL / ROLEX DELA PENA (Photo credit should read ROLEX DELA PENA/AFP/Getty Images) This month China tested a new long-range intercontinental ballistic missile capable of raining 10 nuclear warheads upon its target at once. The test marks what is likely to be a preamble to a highly unnecessary diplomatic clash between two nations who don’t need any more reasons to fight.\nAdvertisement \n\nThe DF-5C missile, which is a newer variant of China’s DF-5 ICBM, was launched earlier in January from the Taiyuan Space Launch Center in central China and landed in an impact range in the desert in western China, according to the Washington Free Beacon . Mounted on the missile were 10 multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRVs, each one containing a nuclear warhead capable of leveling an entire city.\nThe list of countries which have MIRVs includes the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, and they’re considered to be so dangerous to world peace that the U.S. and Russia once tried to ban them towards the end of the Cold War. That bilateral agreement between the two countries never went into effect.\nAdvertisement \n\nLittle is known about China’s DF-5C missile launch, other than the Pentagon’s awareness that the test took place. But China’s recent missile moves have caused some speculation that Beijing is ready to prove it isn’t afraid to confront President Trump over his hawkish language. Earlier in the campaign, he called for a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports. After he won, Trump drew China’s ire in December by calling Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, which was considered an affront to the “One China Policy” that has been in place since the 1970s . China responded with its own muscle flexing, starting with the seizure of a Navy drone in the South China Sea in December, which they eventually gave it back . \nChina has responded more aggressively in other cases, though. It recently deployed its DF-41 ICBM near the Russian border in a move that also was supposedly targeting Trump. And when we say supposedly, consider that it was the Chinese Communist Party’s mouthpiece, Global Times , which said this:\nSome media claimed that the Chinese military intentionally revealed the Dongfeng-41 and connected it with the inauguration of US President Donald Trump . They think this is Beijing’s response to Trump’s provocative remarks on China.﻿\n\nBefore Trump took power, his team showed a tough stance toward China, and in turn, Beijing will ready itself for pressures imposed by the new US government. It is logical that Beijing attaches particular importance to the Dongfeng-41 as a strategic deterrence tool. \nConsidered one of the most advanced ICBM’s in the world, the DF-5C missile has a range of 12,000 kilometers and can carry 12 nuclear warheads. Though China’s nuclear stockpile of 260 warheads is not match for America’s estimated 6,800 warheads , the tense relationship between Beijing and Washington will not help in future talks to minimize tensions over the South China Sea, trade, the UN and other pressing issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:48:42.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
