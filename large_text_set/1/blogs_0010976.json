And what is the difference between a hog and a chicken?” Miller said in a statement. \n“Through his monster alter ego, ‘Gorburger,’ T.J. Miller will ask the big questions,” Alterman said. “Then he will confuse us with clarity.” \nIt will feature celebrity interviews, musical guests, strange games and other random happenings. Guests who appeared during its two-season, digital run included: Jack Black, Carson Daly, Henry Rollins, Flea, Wayne Coyne, Eagles of Death Metal, Grouplove and Tegan and Sara. \nThe show is created by the Director Brothers (Ryan McNeely and Josh Martin) who also write, direct and executive produce the series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:43:23.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
