You belong on NBC, Nothing But Crap. Time for Tomi Lahren to fill your old time slot on Fox News. @megynkelly \n— Mark Dice (@MarkDice) January 3, 2017 \nLiberal critics called Kelly’s hiring an example of NBC crawling to the right in preparation for the incoming Trump administration. (Like it crawled left for the outgoing Obama administration maybe?) NBC in 2016: -Matt Lauer Town Hall with Trump -Jimmy Fallon ruffles Trump’s hair \nNBC in 2017: \n— Jason Rosenberg (@mynameisjro) January 3, 2017 A reminder that NBC Universal dismissed Melisa Harris-Perry’s inclusive platform then courted known race-antagonist, Megyn Kelly. \n— andrew núñez (@andrew_nunez) January 3, 2017 Megyn Kelly led racist coverage at Fox News defending police brutality and demonising innocent African Americans. NBC still hires her. \n— Hussain (@Chemzes) January 3, 2017 \nWell, if controversy means ratings, Kelly’s going to be a hit at whatever programming she ends up in at NBC, whenever it starts. Her contract with Fox is reported to expire in the summer, but there was no word Tuesday on when her next move would start. \nOne thing was clear, though. The on-air talent at NBC are going to have to adjust to a new reality. \nAs one Twitter user put it: Megyn Kelly does double eye point at Chuck Todd:“Look at me. I am the captain now” \n— Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) January 3, 2017 \nAs the saying goes, you don’t make an omelet unless you break a few eggs. \nThere’s no denying Kelly’s move is bringing the Peacock Network a deluge of publicity. The television industry’s about to find out whether that’s such a good thing after all. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
