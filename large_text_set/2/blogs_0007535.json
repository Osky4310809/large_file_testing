It's all gone wrong for Ranieri (Photo: Plumb Images) \nThis season, following the sale of midfield lynchpin N’Golo Kante, Ranieri has reverted to type and started to once again live up to his old Chelsea nickname of ‘The Tinkerman’. \nSystems, line-ups and team selections have varied week to week leaving players scratching their heads and failing to understand their roles on the pitch. \nAnd, added to the change in the post-match meal, it has left the players annoyed. Vardy and co. have struggled this term (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) Schmeichel has already conceded more this season than the entirety of last (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) It's all a far cry from last season's title-winning campaign (Photo: PA) \nRanieri and his Leicester heroes rightly cleaned up with virtually every award last season after their amazing 5,000-1 title triumph. \nBut this term has been a disaster in the Premier League with the club just two points off the bottom after a 3-0 home loss to Manchester United. \nLast season the team virtually picked itself in a settled 4-4-2 formation in which everyone understood their role and their jobs perfectly. \nKante, who defected to league leaders Chelsea, has never been sufficiently replaced despite two transfer windows. N'Golo Kante still hasn't been fully replaced \nThe recent addition of £15million midfielder Wilfred Ndidi looks promising but at 20, it is huge ask for the youngster to pull Leicester out of their current rut. \nWhat some stars felt was required in January was a quality centre-back to shore up the defence and a red-hot striker to end their 2017 top-flight scoring drought. \nBut aside from Ndidi, only Mali centre-back Molla Wague, 25, arrived on loan and Ranieri says he is not yet ready for first team contention. \nIt all adds up to massive headache for Ranieri ahead of Sunday’s crunch trip to fellow strugglers Swansea. Ndidi shows promise, but is raw at just 20 (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) \nBack when Leicester pulled off their ‘Great Escape’ two seasons ago under Nigel Pearson, the Foxes at least were playing well leading into their stunning surge to safety. \nBut the current side look a world away from their form of last season and could be the first champions to go down since Man City in 1938. \nAt least, in the worst case scenario, Mirror Sport understands most of Leicester’s stars who penned big new deals last summer do have relegation clauses in them, which will see their salaries slashed. \nBut it may not be enough to preserve their reputations at this rate – both of the players and boss Ranieri, the FIFA coach of the year. \nThe bookies got it horribly wrong about the Italian last season when he won the title despite being the favourite to be first boss sacked. \nBut this season Ranieri is now favourite for the chop again and perhaps the bookmakers will eventually be vindicated.
