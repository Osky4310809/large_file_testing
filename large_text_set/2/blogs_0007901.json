Ronald Koeman believes the Belgium international is a world-class finisher \nKoeman admits he hasn't spoken to the board about Lukaku's future but is taking Raiola's recent comments as a positive sign. \n\"I didn't speak to the board about Romelu. If his agent says he likes to stay and is close to signing a deal then that is perfect for Everton,\" Koeman said. \n\"Normally players, if they really see a future in a club, they see the team improving, the team is getting stronger every day, then that is always a plus for players to stay. Lukaku is the top scorer in the Premier League this season \n\"We know everybody has his own ambition, that is normal, that's a human being, and we like to keep the good players and he is one of them.\" \nLukaku has scored 16 goals in 23 Premier League appearances this season - form that has helped the Toffees climb to seventh in the division. \nKoeman admits it will be difficult for Everton to replace the former Chelsea striker if he decides to leave the club in the summer. \n\"At the moment, he is top scorer in the league and playing at a high level. He is so clinical and it would be difficult to find a replacement for him. I hope he will stay,\" Koeman said. \n\"First of all, it starts by yourself, it is to improve. He is really a world class finisher but in other detail, in other qualities, he can and must improve and he knows that's the most important thing. The Belgium striker has scored 16 goals in 23 Premier League appearances \n\"If the club and team is improving and showing ambition then it is always a good way to stay for players and that is what we need to show him that he is convinced that the short future is at Everton.\" \nLukaku will be hoping to add to his goal tally when Everton travel to face Middlesbrough on Saturday afternoon. \nAitor Karanka's side have not won in the Premier League since their 3-0 victory over Swansea on December 17.
