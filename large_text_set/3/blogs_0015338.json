Still, Comey made a major confirmation right off the bat: \n“I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI as part of our counter intelligence mission is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.” \nComey’s comments confirm speculation that such an investigation exists, a fact that had not previously been decisively confirmed. Predictably, the FBI director was unable to comment on specific individuals under investigation. \nA handful of the Trump campaign’s formal and informal associates are thought to have connections to the Russian government, including former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort , suspected to have extensive business ties to pro-Russia actors in Ukraine and former Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone, who appears to have communicated with the hacking entity known as Guccifer 2.0 , widely thought to be Russian intelligence . \nWhile the House hearing is ongoing, the American public is unlikely to learn substantial details at this time, but Comey’s confirmation of such an investigation is more substance than many expected.
