That revelation came in an interview with Charlie Rose in which Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK-A , BRK-B ) has bought $12 billion of common stocks since November's election. That is over 200 percent more than the total stocks purchased by Berkshire in the first three quarters of 2016, in which the firm bought only $5.2 billion in shares. \nAt the same time, Berkshire sold $20 billion shares, making it a net seller. Buffett did not address whether Berkshire has purchased more than it has sold after Trump's victory. \nThe revelation of the stock purchase comes after Berkshire Hathaway's net asset value soared following the election, thanks to the so-called Trump rally and what is being called the Trumpflation trade. For example, Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Wells Fargo Corporation ( WFC ) has increased in value by over $5 billion after Donald Trump's victory. \nBuffett's post-Trump purchases are a sharp contrast to other big investors. Trump critic and Clinton supporter George Soros, who called Donald Trump a \"would-be dictator,\" bet against the market following Trump's victory. However, the trade cost Soros around $1 billion. (See also: George Soros Lost Nearly $1B Due to Trump Win .) \nThanks to said Trump rally, Berkshire Hathaway's market capitalization jumped 14 percent, meaning Buffett's firm has made over $30 billion due to Trump's presidential victory. \nBuffett told Charlie Rose Berkshire's purchases were largely his own decision. Buffett, not a fan of the president, has criticized Trump and previously supported Hillary Clinton. He explained to Rose he is not confident Trump will drive economic growth in the U.S. significantly higher. While the new president has apparently promised a 4 percent increase in economic growth, Buffet said \"two percent [growth] will produce miracles.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:17:12.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
