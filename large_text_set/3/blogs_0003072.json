But with fashion month coming to a close, James LaForce, who runs the fashion-heavy public relations firm LaForce , offered a peek inside his offices on East 11th Street, just south of Union Square. He and his 75 employees took a minute on a recent Monday to discuss how they mix their clients’ labels, which include Target and Banana Republic, with their personal favorites. Image Credit Alex Welsh for The New York Times David Shulman Occupation Account supervisor You’re rocking Supreme and you’re rocking it hard. I grew up wearing hoodies and sneakers and baggy clothes, and then it became less O.K. to wear that stuff. But as I grew up, it’s become more acceptable in the workplace. You’re wearing a lot of black underneath. You wear a lot of black in P.R. and I’ve taken it on. It’s easy. Where’s your hoodie from? It’s Raised by Wolves . Cool Canadian brand. I don’t see much of it here. Image Credit Alex Welsh for The New York Times James LaForce Occupation President, LaForce Are you the only guy in the office who wears a bow tie? Yes, I have an exclusive on bow ties. It’s not an everyday thing. I want them to keep asking for more. How do you balance the mix of patterns you’re wearing? I try to balance it and then push it one step out. If it was up to me it would be all solids, but I feel like I have an obligation to the young people here to bring some life to the party. What about your shoes? They’re a wingtip brogue from Barker Black . They have a flexible sole, so they look like a passable dress shoe, but they have the comfort for trudging up and down the subway stairs all day. Image Credit Alex Welsh for The New York Times Abigail White Occupation Senior account executive Your turtle neck is made from a neat, technical fabric. It’s Adidas and Hyke . I liked the color — really unique. It’s raining out, so it’s perfect for today. You glasses are like a camo version of a tortoise shell. They’re Warby Parker, like really old. And I get so many compliments. And some ripped up black jeans. Just J. Crew. They’re from college. I love A.P.C. jeans, but I don’t wear them that often because I’m afraid they’re going to get worn through. Image Credit Alex Welsh for The New York Times McKee Woods Occupation Executive assistant to James LaForce The turtleneck is very on-trend. It’s Muji. I’m really a vintage shopper. This blazer is Paul Smith from a few seasons ago. The pants are Uniqlo. These shoes are from Vagabond . Do they have a heel on them? They do. That goes in with the mixing. Tell me about your feather bracelet. This was given to me by a friend. She’s sort of a spirit guide and like a sorceress. She believes that items you wear can have protective qualities. Lastly, your nails. They’re a little chipped, but I like that. I chose blue glitter because I believe we all need a little bit of glitter. There’s a lot going in the world right now. Image Credit Alex Welsh for The New York Times Fred Giron-Giessen Occupation Intern Great pullover. Is it velour? It was my mom’s friend’s from the ’80s, who died of AIDS. He gave it to her when she first moved to New York. She found it in her basement. I pretty much wear it every day to school. Under your sweater, there’s a thin, blousy layer. It’s kind of a woven American Apparel. It’s pretty see-through but then I wear a cut-off turtleneck underneath. It keeps me warm, but it’s kind of exposed with the low-waisted pants. Those shoes. They’re like a Henri Rousseau painting. These are Adidas, Pharrell Williams shoes. They’re embroidered with flowers and plants. They only go with certain things. Image Credit Alex Welsh for The New York Times Cody Dano Occupation Publicist on global brands team You wear a jacket at the office? It depends on the day. I try to dress up somewhat. I work better when I’m more put together. This is from Banana Republic. It’s a simple black blazer you can wear with jeans or trousers. What’s happening with your patterned shirt underneath? That’s from Target. I like casual button-ups, but with a pop of color. You have some nice jewelry, too. The watch is Michael Kors, an anniversary present from my boyfriend. The bracelet is from Topman. Image Credit Alex Welsh for The New York Times Brittney Marian Occupation Account director That’s a very dramatic coat. This is my mom’s fur. She lives in Arizona, so she doesn’t have a lot of use for it. I kind of just stole it. You’ve got this pink band around your wrist. Were you at a nightclub? I use it as a hair tie. You have another one on your right hand. What’s going on? You can never have too many hair ties. Image Credit Alex Welsh for The New York Times Brian Dunlop Occupation Messenger center and facilities coordinator You’re head of the messenger center, and your shirt has bicycles all over it. It does! I did not connect those two. I like the pattern. I like fun clothes that are quirky. It’s Abercrombie & Fitch. Are you wearing cargo pants? No, there’s just one random pocket. These are EFM for Dockers . Your belt looks as though it has some miles on it. I like to say the belt is “vintage.” I stole it from my brother when I was 15 and it always works, no matter what pair of pants I wear. And I have like 12 other belts. It’s sad.
