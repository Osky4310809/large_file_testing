(Updated) pseudoswede \nI‚Äôm probably in the minority, but I see no need for a fast wireless charger. The only time I use wireless charging (the standard qi) is when I‚Äôm sleeping or at my desk. It fully charges in about three hours; thankfully, I get more than three hours‚Äô sleep at night, so it‚Äôs always fully charged when I wake up. If I need a large battery boost quickly, then I also carry a QC 2.0 charger (both wall wart and car charger). Jeremy Turnley \nFor most people, I would agree. I am an edge case, I have on-call shifts where I can get called at at time. Which means, 1. I am very tired and hunting for a cord is more effort than I want to deal with and 2. I need my phone to be charged as soon as possible in case I need it. \nI think I have only actually had need of the fast charging once, but once was enough to consider a $20-25 expenditure. At that price point, it‚Äôs less expensive than some of the off brand ones. Jeremy Turnley \nI picked one of these up for $20 a couple months back. One big note, the little lip you rest your phone on is really small on these. If you are using a case, it‚Äôs rough to get it positioned right, and if you are using a THICK case, it probably won‚Äôt stay at all. \nBeyond that, it‚Äôs great. My GS7E charges in about 50 minutes on it. JSo \nI miss wireless charging. Nexus 5X user. üôÅ Kelly OBrien \nPicked up the Anker Fast Wireless charger last week for $20. Would rather of had this charger at this price. Maybe a return is in the works for me.
