That made him furious, and he ended up choosing Olivia over his family.”\nAccording to the magazine, “The Newsroom” actress has “a strong personality and every meeting she has had with [Rodgers’ family] has gone badly.”\nShe even caught heat online when she tweeted a Thanksgiving message last year, and angry Green Bay fans responded by accusing Munn, 33, of keeping him from his family at the holiday.\nOlivia Munn WireImage The rift was first laid bare when Rodger’s younger brother, Jordan, went on the reality show “The Bachelorette” last year and admitted to his new love interest that “me and Aaron don’t really have that much of a relationship. It’s just kind of the way he’s chosen to do life, and I chose to stay close with my family and my parents and my brother.”\nA report this week in People magazine said the rift started with a minor disagreement that turned into a big “blow-up.”\nThough it wasn’t clear how long the enmity between the brothers has been going on, the People report portrays it as the culmination of tension between Aaron — a Super Bowl MVP and two-time NFL league MVP — and Jordan, a football journeyman who was cut from three pro teams before going into college-football broadcasting.\nJordan said on “The Bachelortte,” that he grew up in his brother’s shadow.\n“No matter what I did, it was never good enough . . . I was being compared to someone who did it the best,” he said.\n“I could’ve kept playing, but football didn’t define me. Not having a great relationship with my brother Aaron . . . didn’t define me.”\nLuke, the third Rodgers brother, also dished on the feud during a “Bachelorette” segment.\n“It pains both of us, like, not to have that relationship [with Aaron] — we miss our brother,” he said.\nTheir father, Ed Rodgers, told The New York Times earlier this month, “Fame can change things.”\n“It’s complicated,” he said. “We’re hoping for the best.”\nJordan’s biggest public success in life is winning “The Bachelorette” by claiming the affections of JoJo Fletcher, whom he plans to marry this year. It is not clear if Aaron will even attend the ceremony, Jordan said.\nAaron has remained tight-lipped about the estrangement. “I’m not going to speak on those things,” he said last year.\nRelated Video :37 Aaron Rodgers and Olivia Munn's Love Story", "external_links": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/6248098601.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=640", "http://nyp.st/2jzsUch", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/6248098601.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/6248098601.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=462", "http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/aaron-rodgers-family-doesnt-trust-olivia-munn-w461689", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/6248098601.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/6248098601.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&strip=all", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/15/sports/football/aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-nfl-playoffs.html", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/6248098601.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1052", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/6248098601.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&strip=all"], "published": "2017-01-19T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T06:16:04.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
