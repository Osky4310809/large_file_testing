This month, we discovered a last minute issue that could impact some customers and was not resolved in time for our planned updates today. \n\"After considering all options, we made the decision to delay this month's updates. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this change to the existing plan.\" \nI asked officials tonight for more information about the reasons for the delay and was told the company had no comment beyond what's in the statement above. \nMicrosoft also was slated to commence delivery of IE Security-Only updates separately from its Windows 7/8.1 Cumulative Update patches as of February 2017 Patch Tuesday. read this", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:20:43.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
