In other words, these operations would simply be “powered by” Scoot but operate independently. \nIt’s not a bad play as Scoot is going after a pretty big market without dealing with the overhead. Compare that move to the many potential pedal-powered competitors like China’s Bluegogo, Hello Bike, Mobike and others who’ve already realized the need for something between walking and cars in heavily congested cities throughout the globe. Bluegogo recently ran into regulatory issues when it tried to expand in San Francisco, for instance. \nBut Scoot’s offering isn’t unique. Loop is a very similar Vancouver-based scooter sharing network offering turn-key operations based off of its own backend software. \nIt also seems like it could be easy to replicate a similar program anywhere in the world with a little software know-how and a fleet of mopeds. Meanwhile, it doesn’t look like Loop has cornered the worldwide market just yet so it may be a good time for Scoot to drive on in. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T15:58:02.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
