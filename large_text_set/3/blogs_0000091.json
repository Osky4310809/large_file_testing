The last film dug deep into Peter Quill’s relationship with his mom; in this one, he finally gets to meet his biological dad, who turns out to be an actual planet played by Kurt Russell . God bless Marvel Comics and James Gunn for their gleeful willingness to get weird. Also joining in on the adventures this time will be Star-Lord’s foster dad, Yondu ( Michael Rooker ), and Gamora’s adopted sister, Nebula ( Karen Gillan ). Meanwhile, Ego will bring Mantis ( Pom Klementieff ) into the fold, and Ayesha ( Elizabeth Debicki ) will be the villainess chasing after all these lovable rogues.\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 lands in theaters May 5 .\nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos. The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill’s true parentage.
