Also detained was the nursing mother’s younger brother and driver of the vehicle conveying them, Adeniyi Dada. \nTheir vehicle, according to the victims, had been stopped by policemen from New Iyin Police Station at a road block in front of the Ekiti Pavilion. After the initial checking of vehicle documents, Mrs Adeniyi and her brother allegedly were asked to “settle” before they could proceed on their journey, a demand they rejected. \nThe refusal was said to have led to the five policemen on duty at the check point to descend on the nursing mother and her brother, who were severely beaten and marched to the New-Iyin Police Station. \nMrs. Adeyeye had allegedly returned from the United States ten days earlier where she had gone to deliver the baby. Apart from detaining the trio, the police also impounded the victims car. Mrs Adeyeye \nThe woman was breastfeeding her baby, yesterday morning, when journalists visited the police station. The woman’s husband, Mr. Akanni Adeyeye, condemned the alleged brutality by the policemen. Adeyeye, who claimed to have slept in the police station in solidarity with his wife, explained that the policemen requested for the vehicle particulars and driver’s licence of his brother-in-law who drove the car which, according to him, were valid. \nMeanwhile, Ekiti State Chapter of Federation of International Women Lawyers (FIDA) has launched investigation into the matter as the state Chairperson of the body, Mrs. Funke Anoma, stormed the station in connection with the incident at about 12.30 pm, yesterday. \nWhen contacted on phone, the state Commissioner of Police, Abdullahi Chafe, claimed that Mrs. Adeyeye was detained for allegedly slapping a policeman on duty and tearing his uniform, adding that the matter was under investigation.
