Is it a load of bull – or not? \nThe Tottenham boss tried to play down talk of him replacing Luis Enrique at the Camp Nou – but stopped short of ruling himself out of the job. Reuters 5 Spurs chief Pochettino says he is already with one of the biggest clubs in Europe \nAnd Pochettino went out of his way to correct a misunderstanding which had led some people to think he would NEVER consider going to Barca because of his time as a player and manager at city rivals Espanyol. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Tottenham gossip and transfers on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nEarlier this year Pochettino was asked about the Barcelona job and was quoted as saying he was born with a bull in his arms. \nThat was taken by some to mean that he was such an Espanyol man that he could not think of going to Barca – even though the bull is not an Espanyol symbol. \nBut Pochettino said: “What I’m trying to explain is that I know very well the business, the football. Reuters Luis Enrique has announced he will leave his job as Barca boss this summer News Group Newspapers Ltd 5 Pochettino believes he still has plenty to roar about as Tottenham manager \n“Because when I was born, it’s true – my mum and my dad put not a bull, a BALL in my arms. \n“It’s a metaphorical example to say that I understand football, the business. I understand that my name will be on a list. \n“I can only say that I am happy here. I understand the business and I can understand that my name is on some list, like if I go and there appears some list of managers who are at other clubs. It’s normal in football today. \n“I saw, because it’s a big list! 100 names!” Reuters Pochettino quelled talk that he will move to Barca to boss Lionel Messi and Co EPA Enrique has had a mixed time at Barca this season but they lead La Liga RELATED STORIES Manchester United vs Bournemouth team news: Henrikh Mkhitaryan not likely to start despite return Snod in the dock Robert Snodgrass issued arrest warrant for failing to turn up to court over baby in car charges KARREN BRADY It's looking bad for our neighbours Leyton Orient MISS ME?
