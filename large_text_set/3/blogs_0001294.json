But filmer Kylian Castells put it in a moody black and white, and it’s even more terrifying than previously thought. \nThe other big story from Nazaré this week was the head injury suffered by Pedro “Scooby” Vianna . Scooby was a standout himself before the paddle sessions started on Wednesday when he ended up suffering the head injury. \nRELATED: Big-wave surfer Pedro ‘Scooby’ Vianna suffers head injury during Nazaré paddle session \nAccording to an Instagram post, Scooby is currently back at home in Brazil recovering after the head injury.
