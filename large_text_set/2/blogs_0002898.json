Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports \nTom Brady has five Super Bowl rings. Heâ€™s married to a supermodel, has made more than enough money over the course of his NFL career and will go down as arguably the greatest player in league history . \nIn short, the New England Patriots quarterback has nothing left to prove. \nAs such, there are some folks, including former NFL quarterbacks Donovan McNabb and Jim Kelly, who think Brady might as well ride off into the sunset after furthering his legacy Sunday night with an amazing comeback win over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. \nThis would be a great time for Tom \"The Goat\" to retire.
