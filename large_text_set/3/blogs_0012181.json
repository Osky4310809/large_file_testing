PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 22:01, Thu, Mar 16, 2017 GETTY Tim Farron believes the public view Mr Clegg more positively since Brexit \nTim Farron said he had always believed history would be kind to the former deputy prime minister, who led the Liberal Democrats into government and then to electoral disaster. \n\"We would not be in this mess now if Nick Clegg was still deputy prime minister,\" he said. \nIn 2015, the Lib Dems were reduced to a rump of just eight MPs and Mr Clegg was left a broken figure after five years in government, with voters punishing the Lib Dems for joining the coalition with the Tories and breaking their totemic pledge on university tuition fees.
