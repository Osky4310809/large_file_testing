Although Volkswagen wouldn’t elaborate, it did make it clear that pricing for the sporty R-Line Atlas is still undecided.\n- \n-Volkswagen may have taken its sweet time bringing a seven-passenger SUV to market, but it has clearly identified the retail-price targets it needs to hit to make a dent in the segment. For instance, consider that a base 2017 Honda Pilot currently carries an MSRP of $31,535 for a front-wheel-drive LX model and tops out at $48,010 for a full-zoot 4×4 Elite.\n-The Atlas pricing also seems to fall in line with that of the 2017 Ford Explorer , which starts at $32,605 with a naturally aspirated V-6. Limited 4×4 Explorers start at $44,700, and the top-of-the-line Platinum models with an EcoBoost 3.5-liter V-6 command a lofty $54,180. For one final comparison, the 2017 Toyota Highlander starts at $31,570 for a front-drive SE model and stretches to $47,200 for the Limited Platinum with a V-6 and all-wheel drive.\n- - Official Photos and Info: 2018 Volkswagen Atlas - Instrumented Test: 2016 Honda Pilot - Volkswagen Atlas Research: Pricing, Photos, Specs and More! - -Also a player, but not priced yet, is the new 2018 Chevrolet Traverse .
