Â© BCCI \nYuvraj Singh revealed post his match-winning knock on Thursday that he could have retired from the game had skipper Virat Kohli not shown faith in him. The southpaw smashed a career-best 150 to power India to a formidable score of 381/6 after the team was reeling at 25/3. A 256-run partnership with veteran Mahendra Singh Dhoni revived the team's hopes and helped the hosts win the match by 15 runs , also clinching the three-match series 2-0. \nThe 35-year-old said he did contemplate retirement at one stage after his fight against cancer but it was Kohli's trust in him that made him think about repaying the faith. \n\"Self-confidence is always there when you have the backing of the team and captain. I think Virat has showed a lot of trust in me and it was very important for me that people in the dressing room trust me,\" Yuvraj said after India's series clinching win in the second ODI . \n\"There was a time when I was wondering whether to continue or not to continue. I think a lot of people have helped me throughout this journey. So, never giving up is my theory. So I never gave up, kept working hard. I knew times will change,\" the 35-year-old said . \nHis last international hundred came way back in 2011 World Cup in Chennai and no wonder he is happy after his 14th ton. \n\"It feels great. It's been a while since I got a hundred. I came back after recovering from cancer, the first 2-3 years were very hard. I had to work hard on my fitness and I was in and out of the team. I was not able to get a permanent spot.\" \nYuvraj returned on the back of a strong performances in Ranji Trophy this season that saw him hit another career-best -- 260 against Baroda in October last year. \n\"I've been batting well in the domestic season. And I've been hitting the ball really well. I wanted to make it big on my day,\" he said. \nHis inclusion had mixed reactions with some feeling that selectors were going backwards but nothing affected the stylish left-hander. \n\"I don't think about who's reacting to what nor do I read newspapers. I don't watch TV too. I try to focus on my game and prove a point to myself that I'm still good enough for international cricket. So I guess I was good today.\" \n\nAn emotional moment for @YUVSTRONG12 as he brings up his 14th ODI ton #TeamIndia #INDvENG @Paytm pic.twitter.com/cX88vImx0v", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T08:13:02.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
