Takiya’s mother was in the front seat at the wheel.\n“Shots rang out, she told everybody to get down, and once they stopped she asked if everybody was OK and Takiya did not respond,” Holmes said.\nReports reveal that at least 10 kids under the age of 14 have been shot in 2017.\n“These babies haven’t even lived their life, they are in grammar school,” Taylor said.\nNo arrests have been made in either case.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:51:02.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
