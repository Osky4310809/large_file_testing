The incident, labeled a terror attack by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, dealt a blow to a Muslim community already tense from the Islamophobic sentiment rampant beneath Canada's southern border. \nTwo men were apprehended by the police in the wake of the attack, though one was released after being identified as a witness. The latter was a man reportedly of Moroccan descent, and Fox News clung to that bit of information in its reporting, tweeting: \"Suspect in Quebec mosque terror attack was of Moroccan origin, reports show.\" It's disgusting that @FoxNews still hasn't taken down/corrected their tweet re: the Quebec City shooter. It was a white right wing terrorist pic.twitter.com/n9gZKgB2i9 — Sanchi (@likeSanchiKong) January 30, 2017 \nTwitter users quickly excoriated the conservative network for feeding into anti-Muslim rhetoric. Even after Canadian officials announced he was released and that the lone suspect was a white supremacist, Fox News only updated the story much later, though they left the original tweet up. @FoxNews Mosque attack suspect formally charged w/ six counts of murder; Second man cleared, identified as a witness https://t.co/oRzxGHEXDm — Fox News (@FoxNews) January 30, 2017 \nIn fact, it took a request from Trudeau himself for Fox News to finally remove the original tweet. The Prime Minister's Communication's director Kate Purchase shared the email she sent taking the network to task about the misleading language it used and reiterated Canada's commitment to its values. She wrote: Canada is an open, welcoming country that stands by its citizens. We are a nation of millions of immigrants and refugees, of hundreds of cultures, languages, and religions bound by one unwavering, unshakable belief: we are stronger not in spite of our differences, but because of them. These tweets by Fox News dishonour the memory of the six victims and their families by spreading misinformation, playing identity politics, and perpetuating fear and division within our communities. Earlier today I sent an email to @FoxNews about their misleading tweet yesterday.
