But until he comes, I’ll have to pilot the TARDIS myself. \nToymaker Character introduced the TARDIS electronic playset : a plastic reproduction of the iconic spacecraft’s bigger-on-the-inside interior. \nBased on the 2005 design—flown by the Ninth and Tenth Doctors—the toy features a motorized time column (with pulsating lights), and an illuminated console with six control buttons, one for each panel on the original apparatus. \nStep through the police box doors into the endless halls of the TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension In Space). The dimensions of the interior have never been specified, but you don’t have to worry about getting lost among infinite corridors. \nCharacter Group\nThe electronic playset focuses only on the console room—a domed chamber where the flight controls are housed. It even includes removable floor panels so that you can access the storage space beneath. \nTrue to life fiction, the product comes with a coat rack and three-seater car bench, as well as 12 “great” sound and light effects, presumably including the vworp vworp vworp of the materializing ship. \nAimed at Whovians ages five and up, the TARDIS electronic playset is on sale in the UK for £59.9 0; it is not currently available for international shipping. You’ll need four AA batteries, and enough room to display an 18-by-11-by14-inch toy. \nDeveloped by Time Lords, the TARDIS’s “chameleon circuit” allows the device to blend in with its surroundings. But when the circuit in the Doctor’s stolen ship breaks, it remains stuck in the recognizable shape of a 1960s-style London police box. \nWhen Doctor Who returned to televisions in the new millennium, the only similarities between the new TARDIS console room and its previous design was the console itself. \nDuring the Tenth Doctor’s regeneration, the TARDIS caught fire and was heavily damaged; the Eleventh Doctor left the ship for a time, allowing it some privacy to heal and rebuild.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:58:50.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
