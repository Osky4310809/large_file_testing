She's just like Wonder Boy in every way, only different.\nWonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap will be so close to the original Wonder Boy 3 that players will be able to transfer their save data from the Sega Master System version of the game via a password system. You'll also be able to toggle the music and graphics back and forth between old and new.\nAnd yes, there's an 8-bit version Wonder Girl, should you wish to imagine a more gender-balanced 1989.\nWonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is launching 18th April on Switch, PS4 and Xbox One.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/_pUOJzNUdRE"], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:28:02.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
