At that time, I didn't know much about your policies or your aptitude as our president, but I knew your skin resembled mine. Something I had never seen in a presidential candidate. Unaware of the magnitude of the moment, I saw you from across the room, standing tall and proud. \nLike a scene out of Exodus, you parted the sea of wealthy donors and rambling press just to greet me and my dad. You, the Democratic nominee, walked towards me, and looked at me like I was the most important person in the room. \n“Hey, Pastor,” you greeted him, and there I was beaming, my face frozen in a bold grin. Time stood still, and in that moment, it was love at first sight for me. You embraced me in a hug and told me I could meet your daughters one day. \nNow, at 17, I am more than just awestruck. I am proud that you are our country’s first African-American president. \nThe Obamas have shown America what a strong, loving black family looks like. \nThe way you embraced me that day in Dallas, and have connected with me during your eight years in office have changed my life forever.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:51:34.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
