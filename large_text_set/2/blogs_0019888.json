Probably both. \nThe Oscars, being hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, are shaping up to be one of the most turbulent and politically charged ceremonies in recent memory. The ceremony is expected to resemble one very glitzy protest against President Donald Trump, whom award-winners — like Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes — have railed against throughout Hollywood’s awards season. An unusually tense atmosphere has coalesced before the Dolby Theatre ceremony, with protests, rallies and boycotts swirling around this year’s Oscars. \nMORE: Best and worst of the Oscars red carpet \nYet most expect another day of sun for Damien Chazelle’s celebrated musical La La Land, up for a record-tying 14 nominations. A best picture upset, while unlikely, isn’t out the question, though. \nThe other films up for best picture are Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival, Denzel Washington’s Fences, Mel Gibson’s Hacksaw Ridge, David Mackenzie’s Hell or High Water, Theodore Melfi’s Hidden Figures, Kenneth Lonergan’s Manchester by the Sea and Garth Davis’ Lion. \nThe “OscarsSoWhite” crisis of the last two years was largely quelled this season by a richly diverse slate of nominees, thanks to films like Moonlight, Fences and Hidden Figures. \nA record six black actors are nominated. \nFollow our updates below: Originally published as Oscars to be politically charged Follow Us \nA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.
