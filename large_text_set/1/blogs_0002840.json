RECIPE: Taiwanese Hot Pot There probably won’t be any anthropomorphic chipmunks, but this is pretty much the next best thing. Plus, you won’t have to deal with any of Chris Classic’s rapping at a hot pot party. Chan’s Taiwanese hot pot rich bone broth, homemade Sha Cha and peanut sesame dipping sauces, and a hell of a lot of fresh vegetables and meat. You can pretty much pick and choose any and all starches you want, but Sue would probably suggest some udon, taro, dumplings, cellophane noodles, or Chinese noodles. A broth made out of beef bones, onions, garlic, and mushrooms is sure to make your night “hot, hot.” Chipmunks or not, you aren’t going to get a dish better suited for a kickass winter party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T18:13:12.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
