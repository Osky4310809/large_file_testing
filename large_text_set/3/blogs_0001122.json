AP/Bullit Marquez \nMANILA, Philippines â€” Proponents of the revival of the death penalty moved closer to their goal as the House of Representatives passed the bill second reading on Wednesday. \nLawmakers approved proposed amendments on House Bill 4247 through viva voce voting following about three hours of debates. With the viva voce method, supporters of the latest version of the draft legislation responded verbally in chorus and could not be accounted for individually. \nUpon the last roll call, 227 members of the House were present to determine a quorum, or the minimum number of people to decide on legislation. \nThose who opposed the reimposition of capital punishment earlier pushed for nominal voting, but the motion did not earn the assembly's support. \nOpponents also appealed for a longer session of debates, but House leaders were quick to disapprove their amendments and moved to vote. \nThe Duterte administration has pushed for death penalty as a central elements in its campaign against crime and illegal drugs. The government enjoys a supposed \"supermajority\" at the Lower House, making it easier to have its legislative agenda supported.

Gloria Macapagal Arroyo repealed the country's death penalty law as president in 2006. Despite being part of the majority, Arroyo vowed to vote against the proposed measure. \nThe Philippines' efforts to reintroduce the execution of convicts in the justice system are a rare move considering the increase in the number of countries that have abolished it in the past decades.
