No sunshine and rainbows here. Bring on the brutality! Simply don't watch it if you don't like this new level of shock, emotional, horror but don't you dare try ruining it for the rest of us by complaining about what you saw! Most of us are ready some of you are not! Deal with it. Ta ta. Amazing by Dale1688 Anyone saying this is too violent clearly doesn't know the source material. If you thought it was too much then try to think about the type of show you re watching. You are to \"fight the dead, fear the living\" and this shows why. Negan is the biggest antagonist the comics has ever had and this showed exactly why. If you thought it was too much then you should stop watching. Painful to watch by Discombobulate1 This show is great, it is painful to watch and plays on your mind a little. This is a really good show, it is just a shame that it is so grusome that I cant share it with the wife or anyone else in my family.... The violence makes very elegant points throughout all the series and it would not be the walking dead without the \"not nice\" factor...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:45:15.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
