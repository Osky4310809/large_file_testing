But Maddow argued that MSNBC was exercising its First Amendment right to publish information in the public interest. \nBased on the documents obtained by Johnston, Trump paid $36.5 million in taxes on $153 million in income, for an effective tax rate of around 24 percent. That percentage is higher than the roughly 10 percent the average American pays each year — but below the 27.4 percent that taxpayers earning 1 million dollars a year average, according to data from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \nTrump’s tax returns spotlight the role of the Alternative Minimum Tax, which was established nearly five decades ago to prevent the wealthy from using deductions and clever accounting to largely avoid paying taxes. \nThe AMT is a separate gauge of tax liability that, according to critics, has ensnared more middle-class people than intended, raising what they owe the federal government each year. It requires many taxpayers to calculate their taxes twice — once under the rules for regular income tax and then again under AMT — and then pay the higher amount. \nThough opponents of the AMT have focused on the growing number of upper-middle-class earners who pay the tax, Trump’s 2005 disclosure shows it prevented him from avoiding most of the taxes he paid in 2005. If not for the AMT, Trump’s effective tax rate would have been just 3.5 percent. \nTrump, according to his campaign website, has said he wanted to eliminate the tax, which is expected to bring in more than $350 billion in revenues from 2016 to 2025. \nTrump long insisted the American public wasn’t interested in his returns and said little could be learned from them. But Trump’s full returns would contain key details about things like his charitable giving, his income sources, the type of deductions he claimed, how much he earned from his assets and what strategies Trump used to reduce his tax bill. \nThe issue was a major point of attack from his election rival Hillary Clinton, who suggested Trump had something to hide. \nThe White House has not said whether or not the president plans to release his returns while he’s in office. More than 1 million people have signed a White House petition urging the president to release them. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Jeff Horwitz in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report. \n___ \nFollow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T05:37:38.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
