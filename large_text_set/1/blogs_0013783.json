Tied up and waiting for their owners to return, while you contemplate patting them to help them with their separation anxiety.\nSEE ALSO: Happy pups take owner for a joyous snowboarding ride in a winter wonderland\nNow there's an Instagram and Facebook page called \"Sad Dogs Outside Shops,\" dedicated to pictures of these pooches.\nThe account was started by an Irish guy living in Australia named Andy. He's been putting up pictures of sad dogs online for a few years now.\n\"One thing I noticed when I moved over was the amount of dogs tied up at shops! I've always loved dogs and liked to pet them to cheer them up a bit so when I saw them and I thought other people would get a kick out of seeing them online too,\" he told Mashable via Messenger.\nA photo posted by @saddogsoutsideshops on Jan 12, 2017 at 1:40pm PST\nAndy now gets most of his images from submissions, which come from around the world including Spain, Canada, U.S., UK, Ireland and of course, Australia.\nA photo posted by @saddogsoutsideshops on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:56pm PST\n\"I just got our first Russian sad dog this morning which is great. It's like the people, once they were made aware of the dogs, realised that they see them all the time,\" he said.\nA photo posted by @saddogsoutsideshops on Jan 16, 2017 at 12:17am PST\nThe account is of course \"really just a bit of fun\" and \"an antidote to all the rubbish\" that's on Facebook and Instagram nowadays, \"where people are just putting up stylised versions of themselves,\" according to Andy.\nA photo posted by @saddogsoutsideshops on Jan 13, 2017 at 2:53am PST\nWe'll take sad dogs over pretty humans any day.\nA photo posted by @saddogsoutsideshops on Jan 6, 2017 at 10:12pm PST\nA photo posted by @saddogsoutsideshops on Dec 26, 2016 at 10:49am PST\n[h/t Buzzfeed ]\nBONUS: NBD, just a massive alligator out for a stroll", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BPM6_ecA_7L/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPLgNQLgrqO/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPW58zXAQ4q/", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/these-sad-dogs-outside-shops-will-make-you-cry", "https://www.facebook.com/saddogsoutsideshops/?fref=ts", "https://www.instagram.com/saddogsoutsideshops/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BO8-Aw_gYQT/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BOfbNHngzip/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPUXgIOgohC/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/bu6IMCJM.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/bu6IMCJM.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-18T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T07:14:26.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
