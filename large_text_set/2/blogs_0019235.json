With so many changing parts — don't forget, the Minnesota Timberwolves were involved in the trade, too! — it helped shift at least some of today's NBA landscape.\nWith the help of Pro Sports Transactions , we tracked down where all of the players and draft picks are today.\nView As: One Page Slides Carmelo Anthony, of course, was the centerpiece of the deal. He wanted to go to the Knicks and essentially forced the Knicks' and the Nuggets' hands into dealing him before the trade deadline. Nick Wass/AP Today, Anthony is still on the Knicks, though trade rumors constantly swirl around him. Matt Slocum/AP The Knicks also got Chauncey Billups, a respected, capable veteran point guard, in the trade. Winslow Townson/AP Billups was released by the Knicks after the season, and he played three more years in the NBA after. He's now an analyst on ESPN. David Zalubowski/AP Anthony Carter, another veteran point guard, came to the Knicks in the trade. Nick Laham/Getty Carter retired in 2012. He's now an assistant coach with the NBA G-League team the Sioux Skyforce. Rich Pedroncelli/AP Renaldo Balkman rejoined the Knicks in the trade after playing in New York from 2006 to 2008. Christopher Pasatieri/AP Balkman has been playing professionally in Puerto Rico, and is rumored to be part of the upcoming semi-pro league Gotham Ballers.

He is now a scout for the Brooklyn Nets. Frazer Harrison/Getty As part of the three-team trade, the Knicks also got Corey Brewer from the Minnesota Timberwolves. Jim Mone/AP Brewer was cut by the Knicks shortly after. He's bounced around the NBA since, and was recently traded to the Lakers. Jim Mone/AP The Knicks also got the right to swap 2016 first-round picks with the Nuggets. They traded that pick to the Raptors in 2014, and the Raptors used it to draft Jakob Poeltl. David Zalubowski/AP The Nuggets haul was more impressive. They got Danilo Gallinari from the Knicks. Jack Dempsey/AP Gallinari is still on the Nuggets today. Rick Scuteri/AP Wilson Chandler also went to the Nuggets. Jack Dempsey/AP He, too, is still on the Nuggets. David Zalubowski/AP Raymond Felton was having a career year for the Knicks when he got traded to the Nuggets. Sue Ogrocki/AP Felton has bounced around the NBA. Today, he plays for the Clippers. Sue Ogrocki/AP Timofey Mozgov was just a rookie big man when he got traded to the Nuggets. Doug Pensinger/Getty Mozgov now plays for the Lakers. Thearon W. Henderson/Getty The Nuggets also got a great deal of draft picks from the Knicks. Their 2012 second-round pick turned into Quincy Miller. He now plays for Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel. Paul Sancya/AP They also got a 2013 second-round pick and drafted Romero Osby. Osby has bounced around, playing in the G-League, France, Israel, and now appears to do sports radio for Fox Sports. Ronda Churchill/AP Source : Romero Osby/Twitter\nThe Nuggets also got the Knicks' 2014 first-round pick. It was later traded twice, and the Magic used it to draft Dario Saric. Saric was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers on draft day. John Raoux/AP With the 2016 first-round pick swap, the Nuggets took Jamal Murray. David Zalubowski/AP The Nuggets also got Kosta Koufos from the Timberwolves in the trade. Jack Dempsey/AP Today, Koufos plays for the Kings. David Zalubowski/AP The Wolves were essentially used as a salary-dump destination in the trade. The Knicks sent them Eddy Curry in the trade. Kathy Kmonicek/AP Curry never played for the Wolves. He fell out of the league in 2013. Today he's a motivational speaker and plans on joining the new semi-pro league the Champions League. NCTV17Sports/YouTube Source : Chicago Tribune\nAnthony Randolph was also sent to the Wolves. Jim Mone/AP Today, Randolph plays for Real Madrid. EUROLEAGUE BASKETBALL/YouTube The Wolves also got a 2015 second-round pick from the Nuggets. The pick changed hands several times before the 76ers used it to draft Richaun Holmes.
