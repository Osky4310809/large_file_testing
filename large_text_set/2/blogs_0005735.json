Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil was in a daze when he arrived in Amman, Jordan, from Baghdad in July of 2006. He had been anxious, depressed and unable to think clearly ever since his daughter Maha left for school one day and did not return. \nAdvertisement   “I was totally lost,” he said. Mr. Khalil had tried to keep his work with the United States military a secret, even from his family, because he knew that it would make them a target for terrorists. But the day after Maha disappeared in 2004, he received a phone call from someone claiming to be a member of Al Qaeda. The man said that Mr. Khalil had been found out, and would have to pay with Maha’s life. After the family learned that Maha was, indeed, dead, they tried to continue living in Baghdad, where they had the support of their extended family. But they felt they were still being watched by Maha’s killers, and that their other children could be in danger. In 2006, Mr. Khalil left Iraq with his wife, Nahida Mohammad, their 8-year-old son, Mamoon Jumah, and 4-year-old daughter, Maryam Jumah. They moved into a cramped third-floor walk-up apartment, which they paid for with the money saved from selling their home in Iraq. But as unauthorized immigrants, they could not work and had to send the children to private school, because they were ineligible for public benefits. Knowing that their savings would not last, Mr. Khalil registered them as refugees with the United Nations. He hoped they would be relocated to Britain, where his brother lived, or Australia, where he had a friend. Mohamed Sharif Mr. Sharif fled Somalia at age 16, arriving at Kakuma, a refugee camp in northwest Kenya, in 2007. His country had gone through more than a dozen attempts to form a government in his lifetime. It was dangerous for Mr. Sharif to return. More recently, Islamists had taken over — the most militant of them were known to drive around with black flags and shoot people for watching Hollywood movies. Kakuma was a desert camp split by a river, where the temperature often topped 100 degrees. Mr. Sharif came alone, moved into a sheet-metal hut and registered as a refugee. In the camp, he met Bisharo, a single mother with two children, Adnan and Hodan. She had also fled Somalia. “We understood each other,” he said. He picked up work as an electrician. They married, but there was no big wedding. “We didn’t have enough money to make a party.” Photo Mr. Sharif, a Somali refugee who came to the United States in 2014, with a folder that he uses to store his immigration documents.

Afterward, two officials review the case to determine if the person faces serious persecution back home. If concerns of credibility arise, the person undergoes another interview or the case is closed. Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil and his family arrived, as instructed, with their birth certificates, proof of Iraqi citizenship and marriage certificate, at a massive building with blacked-out windows in the northwest corner of Amman. Armed guards were posted outside. They waited in line among hundreds of Iraqis — soldiers, farmers, shopkeepers — all hoping to gain refugee status. \nAdvertisement   Later, as they were photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed over the course of seven hours, they overheard as other Iraqis were denied refugee status. There were tears, yelling, frustration — everyone was pessimistic, no one thought they had a chance. When a United Nations official asked Mr. Khalil through an Arabic interpreter about his daughter Maha, he broke down in tears. “I felt really emotional because it was fresh,” he said. “I could not control myself.” As they awaited news from the United Nations, the family began to unravel. No one could sleep through the night, still distraught over Maha’s death. Mr. Khalil and Ms. Mohammad walked their children to and from school each day, fearing that something could happen to them. A few months later, the call came. Mr. Khalil was to return alone to the same building, and to bring more documents, including Maha’s death certificate. Mohamed Sharif It was a big day. By 2012, Mr. Sharif had waited five years at Kakuma before an official from the United Nations arrived for an interview. Mr. Sharif wore a football T-shirt — he had no dress clothes, and the camp, which was sweltering, was not a place for a suit or tie anyway. The official asked him to tell his story. Bisharo and their children sat with him. Why did he leave Somalia? Mr. Sharif described in Somali the way he had fled his home, fearing death, without a birth certificate or school records. “I have no hope back there,” he later recalled having said. “I don’t have a home to go back to. No one is there.” The interview lasted 90 minutes. Then a break, then more talking — another hour’s worth. Months later, Bisharo gave birth to a baby girl, Nimo. Two weeks afterward, Bisharo died. At 22, he was suddenly the single father of three children. \nAdvertisement   Interviewing With State Department Contractors United States contractors conduct extensive in-person interviews to prepare for a visit from H omeland Security. Background checks begin : A t least five agencies search for applicants in their databases, checking for criminal violations, alternative names and connections to bad individuals and dangerous groups. Faiz Khalil This interview focused on Mr. Khalil’s time in the Iraqi Army. Why did he enlist, he was asked. Because of the promise of a stable life. Why did he become an officer? Because of the benefits: a new car and a piece of land. He described teaching American soldiers about the Iraqi chain of command, which was different from the Americans’, and telling the Americans to request receipts with serial numbers for deliveries of items like batteries or tires — otherwise, he said, some could end up for sale on the Iraqi black market. Mr. Khalil answered his interrogators “like a robot,” he later recalled. “I said, ‘I don’t care if they will accept it or not,’” he said. “I lost my daughter, I lost my house — everything.” During this time, Mr. Khalil and his family watched nervously as their bank accounts dwindled. They had to pay $3 a day per person to the Jordanian government to live there without authorization. It was now winter, and they had never lived anywhere it snowed. They could not afford enough diesel fuel to heat their apartment through the season, so Mr. Khalil and Ms. Mohammad took turns waking up in the middle of the night to turn on the heater for an hour at a time.
