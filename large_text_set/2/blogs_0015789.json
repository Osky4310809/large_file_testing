Steve Nicol assesses the strength of Man United's squad depth as the remain competitive on four fronts. \nThe Chinese Super League's most eventful transfer window ever closes next Tuesday, with the prospect of a deal even bigger than any done before still looming on the horizon. \nWayne Rooney continues to be linked with a move to the ubiquitous \"unnamed Chinese club\" in the English media as either Jose Mourinho or Rooney's agent or both attempt to shift the forward out of the club he has served so successfully for the last 13 years. \nBut, with only a week to go before the transfer period ends, which clubs are likely to make a move for Rooney, and what would be the positives and negatives of a move for the 31-year-old Manchester United and England captain? \nPOSSIBLE DESTINATIONS \nWhile there are only a handful of clubs who could seriously consider offering Rooney the kind of salary that would lure him to China and pay Manchester United a transfer fee that would satisfy Jose Mourinho and the club's board, the reality is there are fewer still likely to do so due to the timing of the proposed move. \nAssuming one of Guangzhou Evergrande, Shanghai SIPG and Jiangsu Suning were interested in signing Rooney -- and even that's a big assumption to make -- one of the attractions of signing such an experienced and talented player would be to make an impact on the Asian Champions League. \nBut with the competition having started and all three clubs unable to add to their submitted squads until before August's quarterfinals, the desire to sign Rooney now would be minimal at best. A move for him in the summer transfer window would be more likely. \nTianjin Quanjian, who have already signed Axel Witsel and Alexander Pato, would be able to afford Rooney. They still have a place in the squad for a foreign player and are looking for a striker, but coach Fabio Cannavaro has ruled out a move for a player he feels does not suit his club's style of play. \nBeijing Guoan's new owners, meanwhile, might want to make Rooney a statement signing as they look to return the club from the capital to the summit of the Chinese Super League. They, too, still have room in their foreign player quota. Wayne Rooney is already a popular figure among football fans in China. \nPROS TO MOVING \nWayne Rooney is already a wealthy man, with his current Manchester United contract reportedly worth £300,000 a week on top of other income from personal endorsement deals. \nBut the money that could be available - with some British reports even stretching to claiming a £1m-a-week wage is on offer -- would be difficult to refuse. Plus, the idea of further building his brand in a country with a population closing in on 1.5 billion people and the sponsorship deals that could come with that could potentially put Rooney's earning potential into David Beckham territory. \nHe could also play a role in further popularising the game in the world's most populous nation while sampling a culture and lifestyle far removed from the Premier League goldfish bowl. That said, Chinese fans are passionate about the game and Rooney, who became Manchester United's all-time top scorer last month, is already popular among them. \nCONS TO MOVING \nIf Rooney were to move, he would very likely be bringing an end to his record-breaking England career. While some foreign players -- most notably Brazilians -- have gone to China and continued to play on the international stage, the chances are a shift to the CSL would see England boss Gareth Southgate reluctant to select Rooney in the future. \nHe has already moved to the margins in some people's eyes given he is not playing regularly at Old Trafford , but a transfer to China would likely see Rooney relinquish the captain's armband and retire as his country's record goal scorer and most-capped outfield player. \nAdditionally, if he does not join one of the teams at the top end of the CSL, Rooney would be in for a long slog throughout the season with little promise of silverware. While the CSL is not of the same calibre as the top leagues in Europe, it is a demanding competition with huge amounts of travel across a vast country and where playing conditions are not at the same level as those to which Rooney is accustomed. Would the large contract potentially on offer be enough to soften the blow? \nMichael Church has written about Asian football for more than 20 years and mainly covers the Chinese game for ESPN FC.
