His latest release, “(No One Knows Me) Like The Piano,” is the song equivalent of cleaning a fresh cut with rubbing alcohol. Raw, emotional and hauntingly honest, it pays homage to the piano that’s been sitting in Sampha’s family home in South London since he was three.\nFor the artist, that particular instrument is where his musical journey started. Many of the songs that will be featured on his forthcoming debut album, Process, were first dreamed up in his mother’s home in front of those piano keys. The highly-anticipated album marks a new path for the formerly fairly mysterious artist. Though he was featured on two of last year’s most celebrated projects – Frank Ocean’s Endless and Solange’s A Seat at the Table – Sampha has remained a bit of a paradox. His music and the faraway, ethereal nature of his voice are painfully emotive, yet the artist himself has given little away in interviews.\n“(No One Knows Me) Like The Piano” reveals yet another side of what appears to be a very multi-faceted character. Hopefully the full album can fill in the puzzle pieces and form a clear picture of what we can expect from the talented musician in the future.\nProcess is set to release February 3. \nIn the meantime, you can learn more about Sampha from our list of artists to discover in 2017 . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:46:02.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
