Chintu, as she called the boy she doted on, would need to pray at least ten minutes before he could sit with the console. It didn’t end there either. At the end of the prayers, he had to eat the Prasad – the food offering for the Gods that usually consisted of dried fruit and nuts. \nTHE WARNER PROBLEM THAT HAS AUSTRALIA WORRIED India's batsman Cheteshwar Pujara celebrate his double century. Source: AFP \nBy the time he was ten years old, the family was spending every summer holiday in Mumbai. Money was tight, and the Pujaras would rent tiny, often unfurnished, apartments where they slept on the floor. The boy didn’t care. In two months, he would play upward of 20 matches and get the kind of exposure that simply wasn’t possible back home in Rajkot. \nThe prayers never stopped, and neither did Rina’s belief that her boy was destined to play for India. \nCheteshwar was a teenager when she was diagnosed with cancer. A couple of months short of his 18th birthday, having just finished an Under-19 game, he called home and told his mum he was taking the bus home. By the time he reached Rajkot, she had passed away. Arvind, the father, says Cheteshwar didn’t even cry. \nThey cried together five years later when Rina’s dream was realised. After making just four in the first innings, Cheteshwar left an imprint on his debut Test against Australia (Bangalore, 2010) with a dazzling second-innings 72 that inspired a comfortable Indian victory. He has played 46 more matches since, averaging 52 and scoring 11 hundreds. Kohli's pointed celebration 0:46 \nIn theory, he should be one of Indian cricket’s primary assets. In reality, he is often an afterthought. \nThe player he’s often, wrongly, compared to was a regular in both formats for more than a decade. In addition to 163 Test caps for India, Rahul Dravid also played 340 ODIs in the sky-blue shirt, and was top scorer at the 1999 World Cup. \nPujara, who played the last of his five ODIs three years ago, has had surgery on both knees and is no longer viewed as a white-ball prospect. At the Indian Premier League auction in February, he elicited no interest from the eight franchises. Thangarasu Natarajan, a left-arm seamer who has played all of nine first-class games, went for $450,000. Pujara last played an IPL game in 2014. \nCome March 30, he will likely head back to Rajkot, where he and his father run an academy for those that dream of becoming the next…Virat Kohli. \nAfter the fun and frolic of the IPL — he and Ishant Sharma are the only ones in the Test XI without a contract — Pujara’s teammates will head to England for the defence of the Champions Trophy. Unless a county side takes a punt on him, as Yorkshire did in 2015, Pujara will spend the Indian summer preparing for next season. Jadeja's sword celebration 0:56 \nHis central contract fetches him around $200,000 a year. With match fees and win bonuses — there have been quite a few of those recently — that figure can swell to $500,000 in a good year. It still isn’t much compared to what some IPL one-season wonders have banked in the past. \nThe Pujara way has little to do with envy though. The father, who played six Ranji Trophy games in the 1970s, was a hard taskmaster, with the emphasis on concentration and technique. Pujara Junior continues to be big on routine. The prayer room at home is right outside his bedroom, and when on tour, he sets up a little corner of his room to make sure the habit inculcated by his mother isn’t broken. \nDropped after a poor run in Australia in 2014, Pujara had to open the batting in a Test in Sri Lanka — he carried his bat for 145 — to get back into the fold. At the start of this season, he was dropped in the Caribbean for scoring too slowly. The irony of that is inescapable. Without his 92 in Bangalore, and the 525-ball double-century in Ranchi, Australia would already have the Border-Gavaskar Trophy bubble-wrapped. Cheteshwar Pujara.

According to Wriddhiman Saha, when Josh Hazlewood had a few words on day four, Pujara’s response was to say: ‘Look at the scoreboard’. \nThanks to his efforts, India can now look at it without cringing. Indian cricket’s least feted superstar has now played two of the most significant innings in the nation’s Test history, back to back, with the promise of more to come in Dharamsala. \nThese days, the small handheld video games have made way for FIFA on the PlayStation with teammates. Not much else has changed, as Chintu lives out his mother’s dream.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:54:50.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
