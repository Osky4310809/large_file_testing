I've told more than one person (including my father, who was very confused) that the color of my soul is black, and I feel sexiest when I'm wearing dark lipstick . So when the Internet started freaking out about a product that married my two favorite things: dewy, cream makeup with a shade of goth, I thought, This is for me. \nTo be honest, the Rituel de Fille Eclipse Inner Glow Crème Pigment (or as it's being dubbed, the \" anti-highlighter \") is basically a blush on steroids. Unlike the intense shimmer powders and unicorn illuminators , the glow involved here is nothing more than a rich mauve flush—which is far from a bad thing. It's eye-catching in a far less obvious way. And like other cream blushes , you can add it to your eyes or your lips for a monochromatic (read: easy but put-together) look. \nClearly, it demanded a full test run. Facebook \nOn my cheeks : I need a little warmth because my skin is so light, so I decided to try the pigment as a highlighter-blush combo. And to see how it looks as a complete look, I added some lipstick. I concentrated the cream blush on the apples of my cheeks and then blended it up onto my cheekbones. (Warning: If you apply it too far under your eyes, it looks like a bruise.) It was a little deep against my complexion, but the more I blended, the more it looked like a berry flush. Plus, it reflects light, so I look lit in a natural way. It could definitely work on a range of skin tones, depending on how much you apply and how much you decide to blend it out or build it up. Facebook \nOn my eyes : I get that deeper colors on your cheeks isn't for everyone, but who doesn't love a one-step smoky eye ? I used a little extra pigment all over my lids and up into the crease, just dabbing and blending with my fingertips. I didn't blend quite as much as I did on my cheeks, and I got this cool purple-black shade. It's super subtle and wearable while still looking smoky. Facebook \nOn my lips : As I mentioned, I'm a big fan of dark lipstick, so I didn't want to blend this one too much. I removed the pigment from my eyes and cheeks and let the shade speak for itself. Against my fair complexion, it totally pops. I can see myself wearing this out at night with a ton of black mascara and not much other makeup or even at work with a creamy champagne highlight on my cheekbones. \nMy Verdict: To the average makeup-wearer, a black highlighter might look intimidating in the packaging. It's really just a pot of black cream pigment, after all. But once you start playing with it, it really is versatile. There's good value in any multitasking beauty product . You can throw in your bag and use all over your face in a pinch. Because who has time to apply a million different shades every morning? \nThis beautiful pot of black highlighting goodness is available for pre-order on ritueldefille.com for $29 now before it launches on April 5th, just in time for spring when I plan to look super glowy—and a little broody—all the time. \nRelated Stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:45:27.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
