AP \nThe company says an employee identified the vehicle after seeing the license plate in an online image. The company checked and immediately contacted authorities. \nIt says it is cooperating fully. \nThe company says \"our thoughts are very much with the victims of this terrible tragedy.\" \nArmed police have arrested eight people in raids linked to the rampage that left three people dead and sowed panic in the heart of London. \nThe Islamic State group said it was responsible, according to the Amaq propaganda agency linked to the jihadist organisation. \n\"The perpetrator of yesterday's attack in front of the British parliament was a soldier of the Islamic State and the operation was carried out in response to calls to target coalition countries,\" Amaq said citing a \"security source.\" \nDefiant British lawmakers returned to \"business as usual\" in the surreal silence of an area of central London normally thronged with tourists. \nTwenty-nine people were treated in hospital, including seven in critical condition, some with \"catastrophic\" injuries. Among them were French school children and foreign tourists. \nThe attacker mowed down pedestrians with a car on Westminster bridge, killing two, and then jumped out and stabbed to death a police officer guarding parliament before being shot dead. \nThe carnage was unleashed on the same day Brussels was marking the anniversary of Islamic State group bombings that killed 32 people. \nHundreds of extra police were on patrol in London as officers worked around the clock to piece together what happened in the deadliest attack in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 people on the capital's transport system in July 2005. \nEurope has been on high alert after a wave of deadly jihadist assaults over the past two years. \nBritain's top anti-terror officer Mark Rowley said that police had arrested eight people in raids on six houses in London, the central city of Birmingham and elsewhere. \n\"It is still our belief... that this attacker acted alone yesterday and was inspired by international terrorism,\" he said. \nDefence Secretary Michael Fallon told BBC radio the working assumption was that the attack was linked to \"Islamic terrorism in some form\". \nThe British flag over parliament flew at half-mast in a sign of mourning while forensic officers in white suits carried out a fingertip search of the courtyard outside where 48-year-old policeman Keith Palmer was stabbed to death. \nPolice officers lined up outside their new headquarters nearby for a minute's silence in front of the eternal flame to officers who have given their lives in service. \nQueen Elizabeth II was due to open the building formally on Thursday but postponed the visit. \n\"My thoughts, prayers, and deepest sympathy are with all those who have been affected by yesterday's awful violence,\" she said, in a statement expressing her \"enduring admiration\" for the police. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan called a candlelit vigil on Trafalgar Square later Thursday. \nAmong those in parliament was Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, whose face was left smeared with blood after giving first aid to the fatally wounded police officer. \nUS President Donald Trump and French President Francois Hollande both spoke to May and Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany stood with Britons \"against all forms of terrorism\". \nBritain's last terror attack was the 2016 assassination of MP Jo Cox by a pro-Nazi sympathiser in her constituency in northern England shortly before the vote to leave the European Union. \nWith inputs from agencies \n 35  35 pm Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:18:16.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
