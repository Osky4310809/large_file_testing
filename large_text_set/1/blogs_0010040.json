Introducing the president-elect, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer admonished the press for even entertaining what is so obviously a news story without merit, and when Trump finally walked out (nearly a half an hour late), the topic stayed pretty much on point.\nAs we‚Äôve seen before in the debates, Trump started out subdued, but quickly went off the rails once the line of questioning from reporters began. Clearly the humiliating of the golden showers story is still eating away at him, which caused him to go off on the above, very bizarre rant about tiny cameras in hotel rooms to answer a question regarding U.S. intelligence about Russia. \nWhat??\n‚ÄúI am extremely careful. I‚Äôm surrounded by bodyguards, I‚Äôm surrounded by people ‚Ä¶ and I always tell them, anywhere, if I‚Äôm leaving this country be very careful, because in your hotel rooms, and no matter where you go, you‚Äôre going to probably have cameras. I‚Äôm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category. And number one I hope you‚Äôre going to be good anyway. But in those rooms you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small, modern technology ‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt see them and you won‚Äôt know. You better be careful or you will be watching yourself on nightly television.‚Äù\nAfter rambling for a bit longer, Trump suddenly turned a hard left and declared: ‚ÄúDoes anyone really believe that story? I‚Äôm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way.‚Äù If we didn‚Äôt know any better, it seems as if the gentleman doth protest too much.\n\nOther were also quick to point that out, as Twitter gleefully began immediately riffing off of his germaphobe remark:\nhe did not say he is a known germaphobe. HE DID NOT. \ndid he really? https://t.co/xnXLLRf85h \n‚Äî Imani Gandy (@AngryBlackLady) January 11, 2017 \n\"Also I'm very much a germaphobe\" ‚Äì Trump (apparently referencing THAT detail in the alleged dossier)\n‚Äî Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) January 11, 2017 \nIt's important to note, and ask mental health professionals about this, you can be a germaphobe and into kink.
