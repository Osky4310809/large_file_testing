It's numbers that we are not used to, even if in England there has been a lot of money involved for a while. It's still another level. \n“I don't think it's normal, but hopefully we come back a bit to normal days and players remember they are playing in the best league in the world. That's, I think, what counts for you as a player if you are on a high salary and you are earning, let's say, enough money… which you normally can't spend in your lifetime.

Football has a history and England has a history, and so does Spain and Germany and Europe as a whole. Football in Europe is No 1 and that is what everyone watches because the best players in the world compete in this area.” \nCosta was dropped by manager Antonio Conte after the Chinese offer turned his head. \nThe Brazil-born striker has decided to stay at least until the summer but the Blues are expected to sell him at the end of the season, and it is clear the Spain international is considering moving to China. \nBallack, talking at the launch of the Star Sixes tournament, added: “You love what you do but it's still a job and you are limited in time earning money and you think about that if someone makes you a crazy offer.
