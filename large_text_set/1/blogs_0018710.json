Ministers are under pressure to make a Commons statement today about the failure of a British missile test.

(See 9.08am.) Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) Not sure govts suggestion that they never talk about nuke tests will wash given they send out press releases about successful ones 09:08 \nNothing has been confirmed yet, but it is very likely that this afternoon we’ll get a statement of some kind from a defence minster about the revelation that a Trident missile test went wrong last summer and that MPs were not told about this when they voted to renew Trident a few weeks later. The Sunday Times broke the story yesterday and on the Andrew Marr Show Theresa May refused four times to say whether she knew about the failure when she spoke in the Commons in favour of Trident renewal. \nOn the Today programme this morning Julian Lewis, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons defence committee, accused David Cameron of being to blame for the cover-up. Lewis said: \nIn fairness to the present prime minister one has to accept that she has been dealt a rotten hand because this matter, the decision to cover it up, if there was such a decision, as appears to be the case, was taken in the dying days of the Cameron administrations when spin doctors were the rule in Number 10 Downing Street. \nLewis also said that he did not think the government would be able to carry on refusing to answer questions about this. About half an hour earlier Greg Clark, the business secretary, who was on talking about the government’s industrial strategy, refused to confirm that a Trident missile test had gone wrong, saying there was a long-standing policy of not commenting on these matters. \nI will post more from Lewis’ interview shortly. \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n11am: Number 10 lobby briefing. \n12pm: Labour MPs Stephen Kinnock and Anna Turley launch a report on the steel industry. \n2.30pm: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. \n3.30pm: A defence minister is expected to either make a statement on the failed Trident missile test, or to answer an urgent question on the topic, but at this point this has not been confirmed. \nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T11:22:38.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
