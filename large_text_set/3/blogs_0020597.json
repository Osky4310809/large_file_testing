Cat Deeley, Emmy-nominated host of So You Think You Can Dance , went to brunch Sunday afternoon and had a terrible time, so she tweeted about the experience and asked her 357,000 followers to “avoid” the two-dollar-sign establishment “at all costs.”\n\nAdvertisement \n\nBefore long, essential celebrity publications like People , Us Weekly , and Busy Philipps’s Instagram picked up the story, where it was discovered by readers like me.\nIt’s a wild ride, and I’d love to take you on it.\n\n1) Cat Deeley went to a Los Angeles restaurant called TOMGEORGE on Sunday afternoon While in Los Angeles “for [ So You Think You Can Dance ’s] season 14 auditions,” Deeley, 40, went to brunch at TOMGEORGE, an Italian restaurant described by Eater as “seriously beautiful.”\nAdvertisement \n\nBut as we all know, beauty is in the eye of the beholder...\n2) She then complained about her experience on Twitter After leaving the restaurant, Deeley spent the next two hours complaining about TOMGEORGE on Twitter. She began by commenting on a screenshot of the restaurant’s Google overview, which included 4.5-star rating she obviously found both inaccurate and troubling.\n\nFour minutes later, she expanded on her initial comments with a photograph of the restaurant (presumably one she took herself) that she captioned with more details regarding her displeasure. “The most disgusting restaurant,” she wrote with a vaguely Trumpian tone. “Terribly run, by a manager - who can only be described as an amateur. Avoid at all costs.”\n\nAs followers began asking more questions about her experience, she was happy to answer them. When asked why the restaurant should be avoided, Deeley responded , “Terrible food. Disaster.” When asked again by someone else, she once again ignored the details and responded with blind passion, writing , “Absolutely awful! Worst restaurant in LA.”\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:49:44.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
