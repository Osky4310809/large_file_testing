They can never tell anyone what they really feel like in fear of their safety. \nRobert Ward is coming out conservative, but in a place he says is risky for those who share his beliefs. \n“If you witness what happened in Berkeley, actually they are so violent on top of it. I mean being a conservative in the Bay Area is like being a heretic,” says Ward. “You lead a double life.
