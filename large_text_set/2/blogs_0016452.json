The majority of our family is gay-friendly, but a few of them on my father’s side are very open about their dislike of the LGBT community.\nOur ceremony will be at a Unitarian Universalist church because we love that they are supportive of the LGBT community and want everyone to feel comfortable and accepted on our big day. I’m terrified that my family members will do or say something to hurt or offend guests at our wedding who have same-sex partners.\nI am considering putting a note on my wedding website that our wedding will be a celebration of love, and to please set aside political and personal beliefs and accept every one of our guests during this happy occasion.\nWould this be appropriate? I don’t know how else to convey the message that we will not tolerate any hateful or offensive remarks or actions against our loved ones.\nAbby, much to her credit, is having none of it:\n“Do not post that message on your website,” she writes.\nYour message should be delivered via a telephone conversation with the people you think may have a problem. A way to phrase it would be to tell them you are planning your wedding and that some of the guests in attendance will be same-sex couples.\nAsk if this would make them uncomfortable, and if the answer is yes, do not invite them.\nOf course, she could print out copies of the column and include one with every invite. That would also get the message across.\n \n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:23:09.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
