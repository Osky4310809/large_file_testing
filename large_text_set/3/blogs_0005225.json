After the result here, to keep the same level over there is going to be very difficult. \n\"They have to work to overcome the first-leg result and they have the qualities for that. They have players who are used to playing very tough games and are able to overcome the result. \n\"That's why we need to prepare well, to be mentally ready, to realise it's going to be tough for 90 minutes. \nEmery respects Luis Enrique call \n\"We need to work well to overcome the complicated part of using the result of the first leg. But we have to be ready for the next 90 minutes. \n\"It is a game to enjoy, it is a beautiful fixture for the Paris fans, ourselves, the club. We want to play that game.\" \nBarca will go into the clash in goalscoring form, having netted 11 times in their past two games â€“ including thrashing Celta Vigo 5-0 in La Liga on Saturday.
