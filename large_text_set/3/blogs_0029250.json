New episodes of the show will air on the Discovery Channel later this year. \nLongtime fans will be happy to know that the premise of the show will remain the same. The cab will pick up unknowing passengers and question them as they take their ride. Contestants will still get kicked out after three wrong answers, and there’s still cash money up for grabs. \nThere’s also something new in store for viewers. Taking a cue from the new trend of celebrities doing things while riding in cars — we’re looking at you “Carpool Karaoke” — the new “Cash Cab” episodes will occasionally feature celebrity guest stars behind the wheel. \nDavid Steinberg, the comedic brains behind “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” has signed on to direct. A host has yet to be announced, though original host Ben Bailey is apparently not returning. \n“Cash Cab” faced some controversy while originally on the air, when it was revealed that half of the “unsuspecting” riders were actually picked in advance by the producers. It is currently unknown how the revamped version will pick out its contestants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:27:48.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
