Trump 's immigration ban, online commenters bombarded Gov. Larry Hogan 's Facebook page to demand that he take a position. \nTwo other GOP governors in Democratic states had condemned... (Erin Cox) \nChasse also said \"the ACLU should be focusing on much more important activities than monitoring the governor's Facebook page.\" \nSince he took office two years ago, Hogan has banned 450 people from leaving comments on his social media page, aides estimated. Scores were recently banned after Hogan's page was bombarded with requests to take a position on Republican President Donald J. Trump 's controversial travel ban that barred immigrants from seven predominately Muslim countries from entering the United States.

The governor did not support Trump as a candidate. \nIn their letter, the ACLU contend Hogan appeared to have blocked their clients \"seemingly because you did not wish to address their questions on various issues or respond to their concerns about your silence in the face of violations of civil rights and liberties by President Donald Trump and his administration.\" \nSeveral other local politicians also ban posters on their Facebook page, according to The Washington Post, but do not exclude as many as the Hogan administration. \nThe Maryland Democratic Party and the government accountability group Common Cause have also criticized the governor for silencing constituents on Facebook. \ntwitter.com/ErinatTheSun", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:57:00.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
