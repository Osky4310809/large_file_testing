(Photo: Twitter) More On Saturday, more than 2 million people turned out for the worldwide women’s march in protest of the actions of President Donald Trump — and some of them drew inspiration from their favorite movies. In the wake of Carrie Fisher’s death, Princess Leia became an unofficial mascot of the protests: Women and girls dressed up as Star Wars ‘ rebel princess and carried her image, with one particularly popular sign (designed for the occasion by graphic artist Hayley Gilmore ) featuring a drawing of Leia from Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope and the words “A Woman’s Place Is in the Resistance.” Though Fisher didn’t live to see her image being carried through the streets on Saturday, her co-star Mark Hamill tweeted his appreciation. I know where she stood. You know where she stood. Such an honor to see her standing with you today. Bigly. #Resistance #WorldWideWomensMarch pic.twitter.com/cwsgoYVSU7 \n— Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) January 21, 2017 “I know where she stood. You know where she stood. Such an honor to see her standing with you today. Bigly,” the actor who plays Luke Skywalker wrote on Saturday, in a post accompanied by images of marching Leias and the hashtag #Resistance. (Hamill has created a new sideline reading Donald Trump tweets in the voice of his animated Batman villain the Joker .) Star Wars wasn’t the only film that galvanized the anti-Trump protestors. Among their signs and posters were quotes from both new and older classics, including Mary Poppins , Grease , Mean Girls , and The Big Lebowski. Below, check out more of the best movie-themed signs shared on social media. Actor Steve Buscemi offered a personal endorsement for this sign inspired by The Big Lebowski. In the 1998 film, the quote is spoken to Buscemi’s character by John Goodman.
