The journal publishes all research study types, from protocols through phase I trials to meta-analyses, including small, specialist studies, and negative studies. Publishing procedures are built around fully open peer review and continuous publication, publishing research online as soon as the article is ready. BMJ Open aims to promote transparency in the publication process by publishing reviewer reports and previous versions of manuscripts as pre-publication histories. Authors are asked to pay article-publishing charges on acceptance; the ability to pay does not influence editorial decisions. All papers are included in MEDLINE/PubMed and Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science). \nThis home page is under development \nIMPACT FACTOR 2.562 Latest Content \nOncology: CanWalk: a feasibility study with embedded randomised controlled trial pilot of a walking intervention for people with recurrent or metastatic cancer (15 February, 2017) \nResearch methods: Dietary phytochemical intake from foods and health outcomes: a systematic review protocol and preliminary scoping (15 February, 2017) \nOphthalmology: Healthcare experiences of patients with age-related macular degeneration: have things improved?
