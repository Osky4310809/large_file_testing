As comic book fans, we can pull a bit of information from her comic book counterpart best known as Kismet or Her, a character created with Adam Warlock. We also know Ayesha will be highly ranked in the villainous group called the Sovereign (who will capture Nebula, at some point) thanks to earlier word from James Gunn. \nNow, Marvel Studio President Kevin Feige is dishing on the character's role while talking to press on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in Atlanta, Georgia. \n\"She’s the one who hires the Ravagers to go after Quill because, and this is sort of a spoiler, so you should be a little careful about it, after the opening that I already described where they’re paid to protect these super-duper expensive batteries that run the entire Sovereign planet, they’re walking away,\" Feige said. \"They’ve defeated the monster, they’re heading back to their ship, and Rocket reveals to Drax that he’s stolen like three of these batteries, because they’re really expensive and they’re not going to notice and 'Who cares?' \n\"The Sovereign are kind of dicks anyway,\" Feige said. \"They’re very pompous, and they’re gold and they’re easily offended, which we’re also told early in this sequence, and that there’s a very particular way you need to deal with them, and you need to speak with them and you need to be delicate, which is not easy for the Guardians, and certainly not easy when Rocket reveals that he’s snagged these things right out from under them, and that creates a bit of strife for them as the Sovereign end up chasing after them, less because they want those three batteries back, but more because how dare they insult the great Sovereign people.\" \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hits theaters May 5, 2017.
