Trump Greets Wisconsin Crowd With His Favorite Holiday Phrase \n“It’s indescribable. You can’t make it up man. Only God can do this,” said Swinney. “Take a guy like me from Pelham. Go to Alabama. Win a national championship. Come to Clemson and have a chance to win a national championship against the best team in the country up until the last second of this game.” \nSwinney played for the University of Alabama, joining the team as a walk-on freshman wide receiver in 1989. He went on to win the national championship with the Tide in 1992.   \nHe later was an assistant coach for Alabama in the 1990s before being losing his job in 2001, when the entire staff was replaced under a new head coach. \nSwinney came to Clemson in 2003 and became head coach in 2008. \nFollowing the loss to Alabama last year, Swinney told a gathering of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes as this year’s season was getting underway, “I don’t need a scoreboard to tell me that I’m a champion. When you are a Christian, you are a champion.” \n“Success is knowing who your Lord and savior is, having true peace and happiness and using that to impact other people’s lives,” he added to many “Amens” from the crowd.   Sharpton Promises ‘Season Of Civil Disobedience’ Regarding Trump Administration \nOf Clemson’s quarterback Deshaun Watson, who threw the game-winning touchdown against Alabama this year, the coach said, “He’s a great human who just happens to be a good quarterback,” Swinney said of Watson, grinning. “… He’s at Clemson because that’s where God put him.” \nWatson, who was a Heisman trophy finalist, racked up 420 yards passing, 43 yards rushing and a total of four touchdowns in the improbable win. FINAL: CLEMSON 35, ALABAMA 31 \nClemson's second national championship in program history. \nHighlights from an epic game heard on @ESPNRadio . pic.twitter.com/8j6hx8TvKO \n— ESPN Radio (@ESPNRadio) January 10, 2017 \nWatson, at the same FCA event in August, described his faith as the “main thing” while noting, “ This gift (God) has given me isn’t a promise — he can take it away at any moment.” \nThe quarterback said it is important for him “to stay prayed up and not just reading the (Bible) but applying it to my life.” \nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation came after Swinney in 2014 charging that “Christian worship seems interwoven into Clemson’s football program” citing a team chaplain that leads Bible studies for the players and “church days” for which the coach organized transportation. \nThe FFRF claimed these optional activities are unconstitutional at a public university. \nSwinney and the school held firm. The coach stated that he recruits players of all faiths and backgrounds and does not seek to force his faith on anyone. \n“I try to be a good example to others, and I work hard to live my life according to my faith,” he said . “I am proud of the great success we have had in developing good players and good men at Clemson.” \nThe university found the coach and his staff’s conduct to be “compliant with the Constitution” and accommodating of differing religions views. Further no players, former or present, felt pressured to participate in any religious activities. \nIn ending his remarks Monday night, Swinney gave praise to God again. “ I’m just so thankful and blessed. It doesn’t even seem real to me. I’m thankful to the good Lord,” he said. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
