He started a weekly basketball game in the Russell Building, for example, and has been urging colleagues to attend. (Cruz is said to be a surprisingly good jump-shooter with miserable form.) Tim Scott has played, and Marco Rubio is said to be joining soon. \nDeadspin asked for proof of Cruz’s basketball skills, and the senator himself obliged: \n— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 25, 2017 \n(And before you ask, no, that’s not a photo of Cruz, but of Grayson Allen . He jokingly acknowledged the meme that they look alike.) \nDeadspin tweeted this in response: @tedcruz Go eat shit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:42:29.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
