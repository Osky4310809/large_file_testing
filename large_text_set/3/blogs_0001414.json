By: Manas Tiwari | New Delhi | Updated: March 3, 2017 4:22 PM IPL 2017: Jasprit Bumrah revealed that master blaster has been a huge influence on him as he was on millions of other kids of his generation. (Source: BCCI) \nGod of Cricket Sachin Tendulkar joined Linkedin as an influencer on Thursday becoming the first cricketer to do so on social media platform and India’s fast bowling sensation Jasprit Bumrah was full of praises for the legend. Bumrah revealed that master blaster has been a huge influence on him as he was on millions of other kids of his generation. The 23-year-old fast bowler, however, is disappointed that his first season in the Indian Premier League turned out to be Sachin’s last and he couldn’t play more matches with his idol. \n“Sachin has been a huge influence not just on me but on an entire generation. We all have grown up watching him play on television. In fact, so many people started playing cricket because of him. When I came into the Mumbai Indians side in 2013, it was, unfortunately, his last season and after that, he retired,” said Bumrah. \nWatch Jasprit Bumrah’s toe crushing Yorkers in Indian jersey: \nBumrah who has picked up 22 wickets in his 11 ODIs so far and became India’s biggest asset in limited overs format in a span of just 12 months, said initially he couldn’t believe that he was sharing the dressing room his icon. “It was tough to believe that I was actually playing with Sachin and sharing the dressing room with him. He is always giving confidence to youngsters which is a very good thing. As a player also you feel really good that such a legend of the game is talking to you, giving you tips, sharing his experiences and it helps you to grow a lot,” he added. \nIn his first post on Linkedin on 2nd March, Sachin opened up about a lot of things like Sunil Gavaskar’s influence on his life, his step to join Swach Bharat campaign and others. “Sunil Gavaskar, one of my heroes and a former cricketer, once said that he made up his mind to quit the game when he found himself checking the clock, to see how much time there was left for the lunch and tea intervals. Suddenly I knew exactly what he meant. My mind and my body were telling me the same thing. Maybe, it’s time to hang up my boots. I also remembered the words of Billy Jean King, at Wimbledon a few years ago – you will know for sure when to go, it will come from inside you, don’t let the world decide when you have to retire,” Sachin wrote about his decision to retire from cricket.
