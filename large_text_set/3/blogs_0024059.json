However, one political cartoon has shown exactly where they are headed and it is absolutely perfect. \nTrump’s health care bill was yanked by the House of Representatives after Republicans failed to secure the 216 votes needed for passage. Obamacare is still the “law of the land… for the foreseeable future,” according to Ryan.   \nDemocrats were united against the bill, but the passage should have happened, considering a Republican majority in Congress. \nInfighting between the Republican moderates and more conservative Republicans looked to be the reason the bill failed, according to Reuters. \nThere was a loss however, and that loss falls on the shoulders of the American people. While many liberals praised the setback, they failed to see that Obamacare is on its way out naturally. The system is broken and all the liberals are concerned about is sticking it to Trump rather than the real issue of having dependable, affordable, health care for American citizens.   \nThis cartoon perfectly sums up where those Democrats and Obamacare is going. Pure Genius. \nIn a piece written Friday, former Bill Clinton strategist Dick Morris explains why this choice by Congress is a failure for the American people, not just a political setback. \n“What makes the choice especially drastic is that Obamacare is dying right before our eyes. If it is the only option to provide health care , those who depend on it will find themselves without any protection. Within a few more months, all the health insurers will have pulled out of Obamacare and refused to participate. They know that staying the program means that they will go broke. They know that the death spiral of fewer enrollees, higher premiums, and a sicker, older risk pool will doom the program and its insurers to insolvency.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:36:17.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
