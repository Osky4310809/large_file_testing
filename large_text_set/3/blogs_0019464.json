Any day now, just waiting for the right time!\" fiasco continues over his contract, the point is rarely made that the Arsenal manager, despite how powerful he is, has not offered himself a new deal. \nIt has been presented with the approval of majority shareholder Stan Kroenke and chief executive Ivan Gazidis. Both of whom have remained very much in the shadows as the tumult that envelopes the club grows. \nThe last time Gazidis was on record saying anything about Wenger's future was Oct. 6, 2016 , when he declared: \"Arsenal is not Arsene Wenger. They're not one in the same thing. He's been clear and we've always been clear, that's a mutual decision as to how long he'll continue.\" \nAt that point, the Gunners were just two points off the top of the table, having recovered well from an opening weekend defeat to Liverpool with five wins and a draw. \nNow, when they've won just one in five and fan unrest is at an all-time high during the 20 years of the Frenchman's tenure, there's nothing but silence. \nHe may well be taking his cue from Kroenke, dubbed Silent Stan, but when you're paid over Â£2 million-a-year to be the chief executive of a massive football club, you have a responsibility to behave in a way that a role of that importance demands. \nWenger, for all his faults, is front and centre, week in, week out. No matter how bad things are, he does his news conferences pre and postmatch. He'll do his interviews for the assorted television companies and meet the print press just as he has done when things have been much more positive. Arsenal fans show their dissatisfaction with majority shareholder Stan Kroenke by unfurling a protest banner. \nBut the Arsenal board, bar one fairly risible statement from the chairman, Sir Chips Keswick, last week, have remained resolutely silent despite the growing uncertainty that surrounds the club. \nThe lack of clarity that surrounds Wenger, and indeed other areas of the club -- including the futures of start players like Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez -- is now clearly affecting the team itself. \nThe performance in the 3-1 defeat at West Brom was abject, and while the players have to take their share of responsibility for that, the relentless pressure on Wenger and the complete ambiguity over his intentions is unquestionably playing a part. \nHis reluctance to make his decision public is understandable in some ways. He's an intelligent man who must know the timing of such an announcement is crucial. However, when he told the press after the West Brom game he knew what he was going to do , it was absurd to then hear him say that nobody else knew what that decision was. Stan Kroenke (left) and Ivan Gazidis have been criticised for how they've handled Arsene Wenger's contract situation. \nHow can such a situation be healthy for Arsenal? How have Kroenke and Gazidis allowed it to play out in this way? And if they want Wenger to stay, as they clearly do by offering a new deal, why have they not made that clear with a public statement of some sort? \nIt might not be what everybody wants to hear, but at least it would show some kind of leadership and that there is a clear vision for what they want to happen. \nInstead, Arsenal fans hear nothing at all from the men who are supposed to be running the club. It feels like a silence of self-preservation, that they're unwilling to back the man they want to stay publicly in case results are bad and it reflects poorly on them. \nAnd with people like that at the very top, it's little wonder Arsenal right now look like a club that doesn't know where they want to go, or how they're going to get there. \nAndrew Mangan is one of ESPN FC's Arsenal bloggers.
