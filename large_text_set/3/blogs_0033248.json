The update brings devices up to build number MHA-L29C185B172 and optimizes “system stability and performance,” according to the change log.\nIn addition, The Android Soul indicates that the update also improves touchscreen responsiveness and battery life, though this isn’t referenced in the update screenshot it provided.\n\nThe update follows a Mate 9 patch from earlier this month which fixed a few nagging issues, including a Google Voice problem with a “certain carrier” (we don’t know which), and some group messaging improvements.\nThe Huawei Mate 9 is up and running with Android Nougat with Huawei’s proprietary EMUI 5.0 interface on top. If you want a better look at what’s included in EMUI 5.0 , hit the link.\nLook out for the update hitting your Mate 9 in the coming days and give us your thoughts on Huawei’s current update process in comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T13:40:23.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
