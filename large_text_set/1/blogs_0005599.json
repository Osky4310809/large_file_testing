At CES 2017, ASUS one upped its Chinese competitor by launching the ASUS ZenFone AR, the world’s first smartphone to support both AR and VR technologies. So, we decided to take a closer look at the device and list out five of its best features. 8GB of RAM to multi-task like crazy \nThe ASUS ZenFone AR has a lot of firsts going for it, but being the spec-obsessed community that we are, we’re excited to tell you that the smartphone comes with 8GB of RAM, and is the very first to boast this spec. While some might write it off as overkill, bear in mind that the smartphone is intended to work fluidly with AR and VR apps, which require a lot of memory. Therefore, the ASUS ZenFone AR can use all the horsepower it can get. The smartphone will ship with a 6GB RAM variant too. Do the Tango with AR and VR support \nWhile the description for the ZenFone AR boldly states that the smartphone is built for Augmented Reality, it also comes with support for Google’s Daydream VR. Besides the 23MP primary sensor, the smartphone is equipped with two other cameras on the back, one of which supports depth sensing while the other which supports motion tracking, much like the cameras on Lenovo’s Phab2 Pro… allowing the smartphone to understand space and motion like humans do. This in turn allows users to make the most of Augmented Reality by means of compatible apps. Users can enjoy Virtual Reality by pairing the smartphone’s WQHD display with Google’s VR headset. Vapor Cooling to avoid another Note7 fiasco \nApps which make use of AR or VR require a lot of computation from both the CPU and GPU, which tends to overheat the smartphone. In order to keep everything cool and tidy inside, ASUS makes use of a new technology dubbed Vapor Cooling which allows the CPU and GPU to work more efficiently. Listen to Nickelback’s greatest hits with SonicMaster 3.0 \nThe ASUS ZenFone AR features a new five-magnet speaker which is driven by a powerful NXP Smart AMP, for expansive, high-volume output. The ASUS ZenFone AR is also able to output certified high-resolution audio to compatible devices at 24-bit/192kHz. Loaded to the brim \nPowered by a Snapdragon 821 processor, the ASUS ZenFone AR sports a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED QHD display. The smartphone boasts an impressive screen-to-body ratio of 79 percent and manages to pack a 3,300mAh battery. Encrusted in metal, the rear of the ASUS ZenFone AR is finished in leather, giving it a luxurious look and feel. Suffice it to say, ASUS has made the ZenFone AR a no compromise smartphone. The ASUS ZenFone AR will be available in major markets starting from Q2 in Charcoal Black with a leather finish. ASUS has not yet revealed the pricing of the smartphone, but seeing the price of the ASUS Zenfone 3 Deluxe ( review ), we expect the ASUS ZenFone AR to go for a premium too.
