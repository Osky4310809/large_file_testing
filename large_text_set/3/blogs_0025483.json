Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.” We mourn the passing of Dallas Green. The Phillies have lost a great man and wonderful friend.

He finished his career with a 20-22 record and a 4.26 ERA in 185 games. \n“The game lost a great baseball man today,” said Phillies Chairman David Montgomery. “Dallas held many different positions in baseball and his passion and love for the game was evident in every role he played.

He'll always have a special place in my heart #RIP @Phillies @MLB \n— Marlon Anderson (@MarlonAnderson8) March 23, 2017 Baseball world lost a giant- Dallas was a hell of a guy and a real leader- he brought that championship to PHI -ill alwys love Dallas Green pic.twitter.com/ktbuido0K8 \n— Pete Rose (@PeteRose_14) March 22, 2017 \n“He was a big man with a big heart and a bigger-than-life personality. Having known Dallas since 1971, he was one of my first phone calls upon becoming Phillies president because of his perspective and advice. All of us at the Phillies had tremendous respect for Dallas as a baseball man and friend. We will miss him dearly. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Sylvia, and his children, Dana, John, Kim and Doug.” \nFormer Phillies outfielder on the 1980 World Series team, Greg Luzinski, said Green’s managerial style worked. \n“You can’t say enough good things about him. I know a lot of people thought he was rough and tough, but he was. That was Dallas’ managerial style and obviously it worked,” Luzinski said. “Off the field he would be the first one to buy you a beer and have dinner with you. His style was very successful for our ballclub and the results were there.” \nFans took to Twitter to remember the Phillies great.
