It's something I'm thinking about.\" \nIn response, Haye told Sky Sports: \"I never envisaged losing this fight, if Tony Bellew does retire - and I truly hope he doesn't - then I will carry on in my path to be number one in the world. \n\"But it is only fair to the fans to rematch against the guy who beat me. If that does not happen, then I will find a way to challenge for the heavyweight title. I believe after sharing a ring with him, he will want to do it again.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:18:57.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
