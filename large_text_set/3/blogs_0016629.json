Wilson/Getty Images for Disney) \nPHILADELPHIA (CBS) — Beasts of one sort or another led the way at the box office over the weekend. \nThe live-action remake of the animated classic, Beauty and the Beast , ran away with first-place honors, earning an estimated $170-million on its debut weekend. \nIt was the biggest March opening of all time, the biggest PG-rated opening of all time, and the seventh-biggest opening in movie history. \nThat dazzling display dropped last weekend’s leader, Kong: Skull Island , into the runner-up slot, taking in another $29-million on its second weekend of release. \nThird place belonged to Logan with $18-million. \nAnd rounding out the top five were Get Out with $13-million and The Shack with $6-million. \nOverall, mostly because of Beauty and the Beast , industry-wide totals were far beyond those of last weekend as well as those of the counterpart weekend last year.
