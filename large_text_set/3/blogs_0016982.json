Jutanugarn fires 63; has to pack for sister By \nRSS \nPHOENIX – Moriya Jutanugarn had to go pack for her sister after running out of holes in her bid to win Sunday at the Bank of Hope Founders Cup. \nAriya Jutanugarn’s big sister recorded her best score in four-plus LPGA seasons, posting a 9-under-par 63 at Wildfire Golf Club to assure her second top-10 finish of the season. Mo was two off the lead when she signed her scorecard. She tied for seventh last month in her homeland’s Honda LPGA Thailand. \nMo was the LPGA’s Rookie of the Year in 2013. \nMo’s reward for Sunday’s strong finish? \n“I have to go pack,” Mo said. \nWith all Ariya’s late Sunday finishes the last year or so, Mo said she has been stuck having to pack for her sister a lot as the first to finish up in the final rounds. \nMo said she can’t remember Ariya ever packing for her. \n“Maybe this year,” Mo said. \nAriya says she loves being the baby sister. \n“My mom and Mo take care of me,” Ariya cracked last summer. “I don’t have to do anything.” Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T02:39:08.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
