Go Pats!!!! \nA photo posted by Tom Brady (@tombrady) on Feb 4, 2017 at 4:04pm PST \nTom Brady must feel like the Super Bowl is Christmas morning. He gets to spend it with family. That may seem obvious for most players, but that hasn’t happened in a while for the Brady family. \nHis mother has been dealing with health issues for the last 18 months. As a result, Galynn Brady hasn’t seen her son play a game all season in person, but she’s in Houston ready to see her son compete in the Super Bowl. She, her husband, and her son took a photo on the field. \nBrady was asked about his mother on Super Bowl Opening Night:\n“My mom and dad, they have been so supportive my entire life, and it is nice to be here to show them and try to make them proud.”\nThe Bradys look like one happy bunch, and they might be even happier on Sunday evening. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:52:02.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
