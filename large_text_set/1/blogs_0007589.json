In case you missed it, we took yet another tour of host Action Bronson’s favorite city: None other than New York. Duh. \nIn Queens, we visited Tony’s Beechhurst, a bona fide institution and maybe the best Italian deli on this side of the Atlantic. In addition to learning how to make some really badass penne alla vodka , we also made off with this crazy-simple recipe for fried chicken with potatoes and peppers. \nNo, it’s not deep-fried chicken, so don’t expect that spicy, crunchy crust that might be popping up in your head. Think more like stir-fried, but with peppers for oomph and potatoes to take away all your winter chills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T19:53:22.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
