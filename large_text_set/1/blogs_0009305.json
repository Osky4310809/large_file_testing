Tiaras, and, dare we even say it—horse-drawn carriages—are often not the best look for a mortal, modern-day bride. But if you do have your heart set on a ceremony fit for a princess, a real-life palace is something of a game changer. And in this scenario, the palace where Kate Middleton and Prince William actually live has got to be the Holy Grail of venues. \nBelieve it or not, you can book Kensington Palace for your wedding. (Nicky Hilton selected the site for her 2015 nuptials—donning a Valentino couture gown for the occasion .) Kensington Palace is also available to book for a range of other events , but somehow your company’s year-end office party just doesn’t scream official residence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, does it? After all, Kensington Palace has a long and storied history as a property of the British royal family. And while your wedding won’t take place in the apartments of Kate Middleton and Prince William, or those of Prince Harry, there are plenty of regal choices to choose from, especially when it comes to the reception. Expand The Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace Photo: Courtesy of Historic Royal Palaces \nThree of Kensington Palace’s gardens and lawns are available for outdoor wedding receptions. The East Front Gardens, which can fit 400 guests, underwent a major refurbishment in 2012. (The plan of the garden dates back to King George II, who ruled during the 18th century.) The Sunken Garden, which has capacity for 80 people, is also available. It is oriented around a central pool, and was originally modeled after a garden at Hampton Court Palace. Finally, the Orangery Lawn, is the behemoth of the trio—it has a capacity for 1,000 guests. However, if you are getting married in winter, the palace also has four indoor reception options. The Entrance Hall can fit up to 300 people and has a platform that works well for speeches. The Cupola Room is another, smaller, option. Though it can house as many as 100 for a reception, its trompe l’oeil ceiling mural is the main draw. Lastly, the King’s Gallery and King’s Drawing Room can also both be booked. \nWhen it comes to the wedding ceremony itself, Kensington Palace’s The Orangery is the only area that is licensed for civil ceremonies and partnership ceremonies. (In England, wedding ceremonies must either take place in a religious institution, such as a church, or a licensed civil location. There’s no such thing as getting married in your own backyard.) Luckily though, the orangery is stunning. Built in 1704, it was created to be the winter garden for Queen Anne, who wanted to house her orange trees there. The area has a long tradition of hosting royal parties and balls. Though the venue can be rented out year-round, it can be booked for limited day or evening for parties of up to 150 and includes a stone terrace. And, if you would like your subsequent reception to take place in the same area, the Orangery has capacity for 300 guests, or 120 for a dinner and dancing. \nOne important thing to note before you book Kensington Palace is that you must use one of their preapproved vendors . But with 13 caterers, six florists, and two pyrotechnics (translation: fireworks!) companies listed, you should be more than all set. So, let the festivities begin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:50:18.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
