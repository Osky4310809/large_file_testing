Okay, Dell, you do you.\nWhat can I say? Dell's new 32-inch 8K display is the most gorgeous monitor ever seen. The monitor itself isn't that exciting, it's the display panel with its 7680x4320 resolution that simply wows. That makes for a 280 pixels-per-inch density that's unrivaled in a display of this size. 5K displays can suck it , because the Dell UP3218K and its 33.2 million pixels is the new king of the hill.\nOf course, that won't come cheap. Dell's shooting for a launch at the end of March 2017 with a price tag that's as lofty as the resolution: $5,000. Let's just hope that Dell is able to follow through on the 8K display better than the never-released 4K OLED 30-incher they unveiled last year.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:17:20.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
