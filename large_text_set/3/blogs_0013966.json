We got rid of our manager, and we got new management. \n\"We pretty much started weeding the people out who were not with this music - the people that believed we needed to stick to a certain criteria as musicians, people who were stuck worrying about money and not worried about anything else. That's the shit that steered us away from them.\" \nThe musician also criticized fans who hate the album for not giving it a proper chance, saying: \"They're not letting the music soak in from what I see. \n\"They're trying their hardest to make other people feel the way they feel, which is not really doing a whole lot, to be real to you. It's not breaking the band. We still are who we are. The fans that are open-minded are allowing the music to soak in, and the fans that are afraid of music are not giving it a chance yet. \n\"They will when they see it live. They will when they come to the show and realize the music is still heavy, it's very cohesive, it fits well with the older music. That's kind of the biggest thing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:10:38.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
