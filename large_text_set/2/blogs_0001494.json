Wade. \nWhile Gorsuch’s judicial record is thin as it relates to abortion cases, he has written against euthanasia and assisted suicide, the latter of which Colorado legalized last November. \n“All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,” he wrote in his 2006 book “The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia.” \nGorsuch’s decisions in two cases — Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor — supported religious exemptions when it came to providing coverage for birth control, as required under the federal health care law. \nCongressional Republicans and their allies are almost certain to rally around whomever Trump picks. The conservative Judicial Crisis Network already has pledged to spend $10 million to defend whomever is the nominee. \nBack in Gorsuch’s home state of Colorado, several attorneys and acquaintances spoke favorably of his temperament and legal skills — not to mention his reputation as double-black diamond skier and the possibility Colorado could get its first Supreme Court justice since White, for whom Gorsuch clerked. \nIn his 2006 confirmation hearing, Gorsuch avoided characterizing his judicial philosophy when asked. \n“I resist pigeonholes. They aren’t terribly helpful,” Gorsuch said. “People do unexpected things. Pigeonholes ignore gray areas in the law.” \nDenver attorney Michael Burg said Gorsuch has issued 10th Circuit Court opinions both for and against his clients. \nLike other Supreme Court judges appointed by liberal or conservative presidents, Gorsuch isn’t always predictable, Burg said. At times, he has crossed over and given decisions considered liberal leaning. \n“It’s hard to know with any certainty which way he’ll go in any particular case,” Burg said. “He is honest. I think he will do what he thinks is right.” \nOnly time will tell, whether his decisions will always please Trump, he said. \n“I think he’s perfect,” said Jason Dunn, a former Colorado deputy attorney general who is now with the firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. \n“Intellectually, he’s as smart as they come,” he added, noting Gorsuch’s education at Columbia, Harvard and Oxford universities. “He’s cut from the same cloth as Justice Scalia – an intellectual giant and judge who can write in a way that’s approachable and readable.” \nPeter Krumholz, an appellate attorney and partner at Hale Westfall in Denver who follows the 10th Circuit, said Gorsuch’s brilliance shows in his writing. \n“He writes in a very elegant, but succinct and readable way. I think he’s a lot like Scalia, not in temperament, but in the sense that they are both craftsman of legal writing,” Krumholz said. “I think I would expect him to be very relatively soon regarded as one of the best craftsmen of judicial opinions on the court.” \nOne area whether Gorsuch does differ from Scalia — the use of contractions in legal opinions. Scalia calls them “vulgarizing” but Gorsuch doesn’t mind an apostrophe or two. \nA former high school classmate of Gorsuch spoke warmly. \n“He is very thoughtful,” said Tom Downey, 51, who ran Al Gore’s 2000 campaign in Colorado and is a partner at Ireland Stapleton Pryor & Pascoe. “He will certainly write an opinion that will upset people who did not vote for Donald Trump but it will be a very reasoned, well-thought out legal opinion.” \nDowney said he attended Georgetown Preparatory School with Gorsuch when Gorsuch’s family lived in the Washington area. Gorsuch’s mother, the late Anne Gorsuch Burford, was a political heavyweight in her own right — having served as Environmental Protection Agency director for the Reagan administration for 22 months after serving in Colorado’s legislature. \nBut Downey said Gorsuch never acted entitled. “It would have been very easy for him to put on airs,” Downey said. But “he was always genuinely nice, genuinely humble.” \nThe two students acted together in the play “The Odd Couple” and Downey, a senior at the time, said Gorsuch, a sophomore, managed to avoid getting hazed or worse because he worked hard, knew his lines and got along well with the cast \n“He just had a good sense of humor and carried himself really well,” Downey said. \nGorsuch, his wife, Louise — a British woman he met at Oxford — and their two daughters live northeast of Boulder. They keep horses, chickens and goats on their 3-acre lot, and Gorsuch is known to spend his free time fly-fishing, hiking and rowing at Boulder Reservoir, the Boulder Daily Camera reported . \nDenver Post staff writer Kirk Mitchell contributed to this report.
