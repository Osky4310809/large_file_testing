He was 82. \"The game lost a great baseball man today,\" Phillies chairman David Montgomery said in a statement . \"Dallas held many different positions in baseball and his passion and love for the game was evident in every role he played. \"He was a big man with a big heart and a bigger-than-life personality. Having known Dallas since 1971, he was one of my first phone calls upon becoming Phillies president because of his perspective and advice. All of us at the Phillies had tremendous respect for Dallas as a baseball man and friend. We will miss him dearly. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Sylvia, and his children, Dana, John, Kim and Doug.\" Green went 20-22 as a major league pitcher in the 1960s, playing for the Phillies, Washington Senators and New York Mets . He moved on in 1967 to become a fixture in the Phillies' front office, working to develop minor-league talent before being named their manager in 1979. Equipped with a fiery temper and a roster of players mostly developed under his tutelage, the Phillies won the World Series in his first season as a manager. He'd leave the organization a year later after Philadelphia fell out of playoff contention, taking over as the Chicago Cubs ' general manager. His GM tenure helped rejuvenate the Cubs in the mid-1980s, and he earned Executive of the Year honors in 1984 from multiple publications. The New York Yankees hired him as their manager before the 1989 season, a tenure that lasted less than a year after famous disagreements with owner George Steinbrenner. With the Yankees struggling and Steinbrenner publicly criticizing his performance, Green sarcastically called him \"Manager George\" and seemed open to a confrontation. Green lasted less than a season with the Yankees, and his managerial career ended with a short stint with the Mets from 1993-96. He finished with a 454-478 record as a manager.
