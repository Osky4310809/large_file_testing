And, if you can bear it, pleased with the British press. \nYesterday marked a historic political moment : Prime Minister Theresa May met President Donald Trump. Writing that was horrid. \nMay met Trump at the White House. Together, they entertained a host of journalists, from US, the UK, and elsewhere. \nEveryone is praising the British journalists' gumption. Reporters, namely BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, asked the US president some cutting, tricky questions, while the Americans seemed a little apprehensive to do so. \nObviously, US journalists have quizzed Trump well in the past, but some feel they haven't stood up to him enough in the past months. When the mic was passed to Kuenssberg, however, she didn't hold back.

There goes that relationship.\" \nThe billionaire wasn't happy at being called out in front of the millions watching. Twitter erupted after the conference. Many were suitably impressed by Kuenssberg and her fellow Brits.

And a handful of US ones also conceived their questioning was on point. Wonder how long it takes for Trump to ban British journalists at his press conferences?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T16:32:22.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
