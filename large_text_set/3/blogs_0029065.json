Joseph Lovelace called public attention to severely dilapidated conditions at Camp Roberts, an Army post near Paso Robles, where sewage bubbled up from showers, old buildings decayed and materials bought for repairs were left out in the open until they, too, deteriorated. He now believes he was punished by the California National Guard for talking to The Sacramento Bee for stories published in 2011. Nathaniel Levine nlevine@sacbee.com i \nBy Adam Ashton \nNine months after he talked with a reporter to expose wasteful spending and mismanagement in the California National Guard , Maj. Joseph Lovelace abruptly received three unexpected performance reviews filled with what he viewed as false praise. \n“With strong mentorship” and “supervision,” he was capable of making good decisions, one review read. He could succeed at a higher rank, it said, “with continued mentorship.” \nThe polite phrases carried an underlying message that senior Army officers recognize as career-killing language: Lovelace’s command did not want him to move to a higher rank, and without a promotion, the Iraq veteran would be compelled to retire. \nNow out of the Army, Lovelace is still fighting to overturn the three performance reviews he received in a three-week cluster five years ago. By holding back his career by impeding his promotion to lieutenant colonel, he argues, the reviews effectively trimmed his lifetime earnings because he would have earned more money in retirement at the higher rank. \nAn Army investigation concluded in 2014 that the reviews were handled inappropriately, and two of his former supervisors have reported that Lovelace suffered retaliation after he identified himself as a source for Sacramento Bee stories in 2011. \nBut the reviews stand, and Lovelace is contesting them through a Pentagon agency, saying he was driven out of the National Guard for drawing attention to neglected problems. \n“Even if I was as terrible as they thought I was, they still couldn’t have done what they did,” Lovelace, 46, of Paso Robles, told The Bee. \nLovelace, who once was a rising star in the National Guard coming out of 2007 Iraq deployment, was a source for Sacramento Bee stories that exposed illegal retention bonuses the National Guard handed to tens of thousands of citizen soldiers. \nLovelace also called public attention to severely dilapidated conditions at Camp Roberts , an Army post near Paso Robles, where sewage bubbled up from showers, old buildings decayed and materials bought for repairs were left out in the open until they, too, deteriorated. \nThe stories led to a shake-up in the California National Guard’s command and prompted changes in an organization that current commander Maj. Gen. David Baldwin at the time said had “lost its focus on the value of selfless service.” They also shaped a law that gave more independence to the California Military Department’s inspector general and enhanced protections for whistleblowers. Retired Maj. Joseph Lovelace helped expose severely degraded conditions at Camp Roberts, a California National Guard post near Paso Robles.
