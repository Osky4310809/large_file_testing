She’s been trying to find a nanny who is right for her and the children. She is yet to find one she likes. \n“It has obviously been tough given everything that has been going on between Jeremy and Vicky. For years and years Vicky was in their lives to look after the children and now everything has turned on its head.” \nJeremy and Vicky looked happy and relaxed as they stayed at his Caribbean bolthole. \nHe has given her keys to the home and told her she can stay there as often as she wants. \nThe source went on: “They will stay in Barbados as often as Jeremy’s filming allows. The island is their sanctuary and it’s a place they can be openly together. \n“They can enjoy themselves as a new couple in love rather than staying hidden away. He’s enjoying getting on with his new life.” \nJeremy and Vicky were on board a catamaran in Barbados when they were spotted for the first time together since news broke of their relationship. Vicky Buron (Photo: The Mega Agency) \nEnjoying a dip in the sea and drinks with friends, the pair looked relaxed and happy. \nAnd Vicky is understood to have put her stamp on the Caribbean home by ­co-ordinating renovations at the ­property. After returning to the UK the couple told pals they had a great time and can’t wait to go back to Barbados. \nJeremy later picked his three children up from the family home and enjoyed the weekend with them. \nThe Sunday Mirror revealed last month how the TV star, famed for quizzing other people over their romantic entanglements, had fallen for Vicky. \nShe became the family nanny almost a decade ago and often went to Barbados with Jeremy, Carla and the kids. \nJeremy, who got divorced from Carla a year ago, also has a grown-up daughter – Harriet, 26 – from his first marriage to Kirsty Rowley.
