Scientists recently announced that an eighth continent could be added to the seven we already know and love. \nIt’s called Zealandia (pretty cool name, right?), and some of it has been visible this whole time. The islands that make up New Zealand are part of the landmass that is otherwise 94 percent submerged. \nScientists published in the Geological Society of America Journal claim that Zealandia is 1.9 million square miles— about two thirds of Australia. \nQualifications to be called a continent include: elevation above the surrounding area, distinctive geology, well-defined area and a crust thicker than the ocean floor. Zealandia has all of these. 2 \nGeologist Nick Mortimer says the research on Zealandia has spanned over two decades. \n“The scientific value of classifying Zealandia as a continent is much more than just an extra name on a list. That a continent can be so submerged yet unfragmented makes it useful for exploring the cohesion and breakup of continental crust,” he says. \nZealandia’s crust varies from 6 to 18 miles, and while this is the thinnest of any continent, the crust increases to around 24 miles under areas of New Zealand’s South Island. 3 \nBefore separating in the Late Cretaceous period, the underwater landmass was part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Besides having to add a new paragraph in 5th grade geography books, the research obviously has more significance. The study says, “Zealandia illustrates that the large and the obvious in natural science can be overlooked.” \nYes, yes it does, Who knows what else is lurking inside the deep blue sea?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:10:19.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
