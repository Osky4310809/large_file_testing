He told parliament this week that his party wanted to “unite black people in South Africa” to expropriate land without compensation.\nAlthough progress has been made in transferring property to black South Africans, land ownership is still believed to be skewed in favour of whites.\nThe Institute of Race Relations, an independent research body, said that providing a racial breakdown of South Africa’s rural landowners was “almost impossible.”\n“In the first place the state owns some 22 per cent of the land in the country, including land in the former homelands, most of which is occupied by black subsistence farmers who have no title and seem unlikely to get it any time soon,” the group said.\n“This leaves around 78 per cent of land in private hands, but the race of these private owners is not known.”\nRelated Brawl erupts in South African parliament over president’s corruption allegations South African President Jacob Zuma must face hundreds of corruption charges, court rules Zuma under fire for spending $26 million on upgrades to his home ‘amid a sea of poverty’ Zuma’s comments caused outrage among groups representing Afrikaans-speaking farmers. The Boer Afrikaner Volksraad said it would consider land expropriation without compensation as “a declaration of war.”\n“We are ready to fight back,” said Andries Breytenbach, the group’s chairman. “We need urgent mediation between us and the government.\n“If this starts, it will turn into a racial war which we want to prevent.”\nLast month Zuma called in the military to maintain “law and order” in Cape Town ahead of expected protests calling for him to step down.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T05:44:44.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
