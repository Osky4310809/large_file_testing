Logan will mark the actor’s finale time playing the iconic mutant, and the press have reacted favorably to the flick. However, sources still can’t pin down whether or not a post-credits scene has been added to Logan. Reports surfaced earlier this week that Logan had added an additional scene after press screenings wrapped, but that may not be the case. Over on Twitter, the director of Logan is contesting the rumor with words of his own. \nTaking to social media, James Mangold has plenty to say when fans asked him about a potential post-credits scene. The director was asked if the post-credits scene was something the director had planned all along, but Mangold said there was no such thing. \n“There is not a post credits scene,” the director replied. \nOf course, Mangold’s words conflict with reports which surfaced earlier this week. The other day, Collider reportedly confirmed a post-credits scene had been added. Steve Weintraub had this to say about the scoop: “I can confirm it’s true. When Logan is released on March 3rd it’ll have a post-credits scene. I’m not sure if it’s half way through the credits or at the very end, but I can 100% tell you something will be there.” \nRight now, it seems the status of Logan ’s post-credit potential is in flux. Reported runtime descriptions showed that three extra minutes of footage were added to Logan’s theatrical cut, so there is a chance the addition has to do with a new scene. So, for now, it seems like fans would do well to wait the extra minutes after Logan ends to check for a post-credits blip. \nAre you excited to see Logan ? Let us know how hyped you are with our anticipation rankings ! Currently, the film is #6 on our site! \nLogan takes place in the year 2029, where mutant births have become extremely rare. The defenders of mutant kind, the X-Men , are long gone, and the only remains of them are an old and struggling Charles Xavier and a weary Logan. Logan's vaunted healing factor has slowed, and at times doesn't seem to work at all. When a young mutant needs his help, Logan has to unsheathe his claws once more. His job isn't over yet. \n@borbs There is not a post credits scene. — Mangold (@mang0ld) February 21, 2017 \nLogan stars Hugh Jackman (Logan), Boyd Holbrook (Donald Pierce), Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier), Dafne Keen (Laura Kinney/X-23), Doris Morgado (Maria), Stephen Merchant (Caliban), Elizabeth Rodriguez (Gabriela), and Richard E. Grant (Dr. Zander Rice). James Mangold is directing and helped on the screenplay along with Scott Frank and Michael Green.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:52:10.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
