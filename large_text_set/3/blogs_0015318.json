The demographics of Atwater Village have been changing pretty dramatically over the past decade or so, making Tee Gee some pretty prime real estate.\nAdd to that the fact that longtime owner Betty Barlotta passed away just over a year ago, and suddenly the future seems quite uncertain for the 70-year-old bar. A real estate listing for the place posted earlier this month first let out details of a possible changing of the guard, but a call to the bar late last week by Eater didn’t reveal much else (other than one bartender refuting the “for sale” claim entirely). Now, as The Eastsider reports, leasing signage is officially up.\nIt’s too early to predict the future of Club Tee Gee, which remains open in Atwater Village. But with so many bustling shops and restaurants taking over that strip, it’s likely someone new is going to come along, and bring an entirely new business into the Tee Gee space.\nLA's Best Dive Bars [ELA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:39:10.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
