The researchers surmised that limited access to specialty care and a preference to receive treatment from primary care doctors has led to the expansion of CNS prescriptions outside of psychiatrists’ offices. \n“The growth in polypharmacy in rural settings, where access to specialty mental health or pain care is particularly limited, is part of this broader trend,” they wrote. \nIt suggests “that the increases partly reflect doctors and patients falling back on medications when they have little access to other options,” Dr. Mark Olfson of Columbia University, one of the co-authors of the study, told the New York Times. Those options could include everything from talk therapy to relaxation techniques like yoga or massages. Only 10 percent of visits studied included such alternatives to psychiatric drugs. \nNearly half ‒ almost 46 percent ‒ of people with at least three prescriptions had no diagnosis of a mood, chronic pain or sleep problems, the study found. \n“This is a particularly worrisome pattern and suggests some inappropriate prescribing,” Olfson said, stressing the need for alternatives. \nThe research team from the University of Michigan and VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System analyzed data collected from a representative sample of doctors’ offices by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during that 10-year span. \nMaust, along with colleagues, recently published two other papers on the use of CNS drugs in older patients. A study published in December found that, in 2010, 5.6 percent of doctor visits by people aged 65 or older included a prescription for a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. More than a quarter of those same visits also included a prescription for an antidepressant, while 10 percent included a prescription for an opioid drug. \nOnly 16 percent of those who continued to receive a benzodiazepine prescription had a diagnosed mental health condition, and almost none were referred to psychotherapy. \nAnother paper, published in January, found that more than half of older patients who had been prescribed an antidepressant for depression by their primary care physician, rather than for an off-label use, did not meet the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:18:27.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
