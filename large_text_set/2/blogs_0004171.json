Schamma takes the role of Geralt, and this isn't his first time cosplaying as the fearsome monster hunter. \nIn the past, Schamma was hired by The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red to cosplay as Geralt, for large events such as Gamescom and E3 in 2016. Schamma has also starred in his own NSFW Witcher-themed calendar. \nHowever, this film has no affiliation with CD Projekt Red. It is directed by Leo Kei Angelos and produced by Erika Rogers, who also plays as Triss in the movie. In this fan film, we see Geralt and Triss defeat an enemy with the help of Geralt's crossbow and combative skills, along with Triss' magical fireballs. \nCheck it out for yourself below. \nYou can read our review of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which released a couple years ago, by heading here . \nEmail the author , or follow on Game Informer .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T21:22:11.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
