It’s time for you to leave your bubble to apologize to the Jewish people and, to be sure, the other peoples also targeted by the Nazis.”\nLast month, Goldstein slammed President Trump for his delay in speaking out against anti-Semitism following the recurring incidents of vandalism and threats targeting Jewish centers across the country, describing his words as “too little” and “too late.”\nThe director accused Trump of only making the comments amid mounting pressure to address anti-Semitism. “The President’s sudden acknowledgement is a Band-Aid on the cancer of anti-Semitism that has infected his own Administration,” he said . “Make no mistake: The anti-Semitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:52:20.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
