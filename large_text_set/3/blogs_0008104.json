Moorhead federal building, 1000 Liberty Ave., and assemble there, the application shows. \nPittsburgh city spokesman Timothy McNulty said marchers plan to use the sidewalk after 6 p.m. \nA committee representative could not be reached immediately Tuesday, but the application indicates the event is in concert with women in 40 countries and more than a dozen U.S. cities. It should conclude by 7 p.m. \nDating to the early 1900s, International Women’s Day celebrates the social, cultural and political achievements of women while urging gender equality, according to a website for the global campaign . \nRelated events in the Pittsburgh area include a walkout set for shortly after 3 p.m. Wednesday at Carnegie Mellon University.
