While younger voters are more likely to support legalizing marijuana, for those who were born after January 20, 1993, Trump will likely be the first president in their lifetime to have never used illegal drugs.

New Hampshire has been ravaged by opioid overdoses in recent years. \n“The world is so tough and it is so competitive that you can’t put yourself, as a child, or even as a parent, if you want that child to be successful, at a disadvantage of letting them drink or letting them take drugs because it is not going to work,”Trump said, urging sobriety. “They are going to be at a tremendous disadvantage and ultimately they may not recover.” \nTrump cites his deceased brother Fred’s losing battle with alcoholism as one of his motivations for staying sober and says he tried to instill the same values in his children. \n“When my children were growing up, even when they didn’t know what drinking was, I’d say ‘no alcohol, no cigarettes, no drugs'” he said last April at a CNN town hall. \nTrump’s teetotaler approach to alcohol and drugs contrasts with that of his last three predecessors.

REUTERS/Larry Downing (AUSTRALIA – Tags: POLITICS) – RTR2U2RV \nBarack Obama was open about his use of both marijuana and cocaine in his younger days, admitting to both in one of his books. When asked in 2006 whether he “inhaled” when smoking marijuana, Obama replied in the affirmative. “That was the point,” he said . \nGeorge W. Bush admitted to having drinking problems in his youth and avoided denying accusations that he used cocaine. \nWhen running for president in 1999, Bush was the only Republican candidate who wouldn’t deny using cocaine. \nIn 1999, when asked by The Washington Post why he wouldn’t deny using cocaine, he dodged the question. “I’m not going to talk about what I did years ago,” Bush answered , adding: “I made mistakes. I’ve asked people to not let the rumors get in the way of the facts. I’ve told people I’ve learned from my mistakes – and I have. And I’m going to leave it at that.” \nWhen asked in an interview about marijuana use, Bush hinted at using the drug but said he wouldn’t admit to using it. “You know why? ‘Cause I don’t want some little kid doing what I tried,” he said. “Do you want your little kid to say ‘Hey daddy, President Bush tried marijuana, I think I will’?” he added. \nWhen running for president in 1992, Bill Clinton — then-governor of Arkansas — admitted to having smoked marijuana but claimed he only did so “a time or two” while studying as a Rhodes Scholar in England. Clinton famously claimed he “didn’t inhale” when smoking marijuana. \n“When I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and didn’t like it. I didn’t inhale, and I didn’t try it again,” Clinton said. \nWATCH: \nAs for Trump, expect him to keep repeating his mantra: no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. \nWATCH:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T05:13:38.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
