Under the task force proposals, alcohol-free cannabis lounges would be allowed. \nT he panel's report noted public health experts tend to favor a minimum age of 21 as the brain continues to develop to about 25, but said setting the minimum age too high would preserve the illicit market. \nCanadian youth have higher rates of cannabis use than their peers worldwide. \nWhile the government moves to legalize marijuana retail outlets selling pot for recreational use have already been set up.
