The General Secretary of the NLC, Dr. Peter Ozo-Eson, told our correspondent on the telephone in Abuja that the Federal Government should ensure that the monies paid to the ghost workers were traced and the recipients prosecuted to serve as a deterrent to others. He said the Federal Government must go beyond the periodic announcement of discovered ghost workers to actual prosecution of the perpetrators of the crimes to convince Nigerians that ghost workers were truly discovered. Ozo-Eson was reacting to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on December 27, 2016, that the government uncovered 50,000 ghost workers and saved the country the sum of N13bn per month in 2016. He stressed that only the prosecution of those behind the criminal diversion of state funds through the ghost workers’ syndrome would give credibility to the anti-corruption claim of the government. The NLC secretary stated, “We have continued to hammer on this that you cannot claim that you discovered ghost workers; if you discovered one ghost worker, you should be able to trace where the salary of that ghost has been going; who has been taking it, and you make an example of such persons. “You need to bring these people to book; it is only then that we can know that indeed there were ghost workers. “You don’t just periodically announce to us that so many thousands of ‘ghost’ workers were detected and you have saved so much and no single person has been brought to book for such a fraud. We think it is not the best.” He advised the Federal Government to involve the anti-graft agencies to trace the funds through the banks in order to identify the perpetrators of the criminal act. Ozo-Eson believed the payment of N5,000 monthly stipends to poor Nigerians could be abused without a robust database. He said it was important for the government to come up with a transparent process to identify the beneficiaries and the grounds for qualification. He argued that unscrupulous elements could take advantage of the absence of a database to divert funds meant for poor Nigerians while claiming that the citizens were being empowered. Copyright PUNCH.
