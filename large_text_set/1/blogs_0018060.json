They were literally squealing with joy at times! Even us parents thought it was pretty cute, and appreciated that there was nothing at all inappropriate.... Great family movie!! By amydeetz This movie turned out a lot better than I expected! Highly recommend taking the kids, plus it's fun for the grown-ups too!... Reward the filmmakers for making a film that is not a reboot, remake or sequel, go see this! By markdinatale I want to commend the filmmakers on this film. There was a lot of bad press about it even coming from the studio as writing it off as a loss before it was even released. We saw the fist showing... LOVED THIS TOTALLY KID FRIENDLY MOVIE By Ussoldier1121 Had to find a good movie for my son to stay focused also my husband to not sleep through. Great job!!... Great family-friendly movie! My son and I really enjoyed this movie. Well worth the ticket price.... Great for the kids! By jennaurso Please don't listen to the \"professional critics\" on sites like Rotten Tomatoes! I am beyond sick of adult reviewers hating on children's movies because the acting isn't Oscar worthy and the plot...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T03:41:26.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
