The selfie that sparked concern from Scarlett's fans (Photo: Instagram/Scarlett Moffatt) \n\"Apparently if you've got a big forehead you’re intelligent so I put it up as a joke, but people were like 'you've gone too far',\" she told the panel. \nIt comes after Scarlett lost over three stone from overhauling her diet and embarking on a strict exercise regime, and in the process filming her bestselling DVD. \nAfter last week's offering, one concerned fan wrote: \"Please don't lose any more weight,\" while another added: \"I don't want to hurt you look amazing but please don't lose any more weight.\" Scarlett defended her weight, pointing out that she's only five feet tall (Photo: Channel 5) \nThe comments came just days after Scarlett revealed to This Morning that she was once considered obese by doctors. \nShe decided to make changes after finding out she weighed nearly 12 stone. \nScarlett went to her GP with back pain and low energy levels. He later blamed the excess weight she was carrying. The TV personality has since lost 3 stone (Photo: Instagram) \n\"It was hard for me, going home and explaining to my mum and dad why I went to the doctors and what was wrong with me,\" she said. \n\"They also tested me for diabetes type 2 because they said I could be pre-diabetic, and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm 25, I don't understand how I've got to this.'\" \nBut it wasn't an easy journey. In a sneak preview from the DVD, the star can be seen at the start of her journey getting weighed. \nWhen she finds out she weighs 11 stone 5lbs, she bursts into tears. \"I would just say to anyone starting out [losing weight and getting healthy], just focus on the positives,\" Scarlett added.
