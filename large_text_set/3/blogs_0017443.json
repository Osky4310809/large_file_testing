The effective executive knows this to be true, and welcomes change into some parts of the organization, while holding it at bay from others.\nConsider Amazon: The company has almost single-handedly transformed major parts of the retail, logistics, and internet sectors in just two decades. It has kept up a feverish pace of change in its consumer offerings, shaping how we shop for everyday goods (online), who influences our purchase decisions (anonymous fellow customers), what we read (ebooks), when we expect to receive orders (same day) and where our purchases come from (warehouses we never see).\nYet for all its innovation, Amazon’s approach to managing its money has changed little in 20 years. It constantly plows capital into its long-term operations — often at the expense of short-term financial results. Similarly, contrast Amazon’s unflinching commitment to its Weekly Business Review (how the company staffs the process for coordinating its sprawling operations) with the idiosyncratic way in which unsolicited emails from individual customers can trigger major internal restructuring.\nA.G. Lafley and Roger Martin coined the term cumulative advantage to describe the distinct strategic benefit of not changing. “Holding on to customers is not a matter of continually adapting to changing needs in order to remain the rational or emotional best fit,” they write. “It’s about helping customers avoid having to make yet another choice.”\nYet how often do executives ask, “What are we doing to help our customers avoid having to make yet another choice?” The question I hear too often instead is, “What are we doing to keep pace in these times of rapid change?” The task of the executive managing change today is thus not to turn the entire organization into an intestine by extracting value, and discarding waste, as quickly as possible. It is to ask of change in any one area of the business: At what pace? And to what end?\nEffective executives learn to balance the tension between going slow and moving fast by studying the context of their choices. Blackberry’s adoption of the touchscreen interface appears slow in retrospect, having come more than a year after the first iPhone. Yet BlackBerry had previously been beloved in part for its staunch commitment to the full (if miniature) keyboard when its competitors were cranking out flip phones. Looking back, should we call BlackBerry resistant or resilient?\nHigher education, a popular whipping boy for being slow to change, has in fact been conspicuously successful in its doggedness. The youngest top-tier American university, Caltech, was founded in the 19th century. Ivy League institutions have remained atop their industry for more than 300 years. Compare that with the Fortune 500: Only 12% of the firms on the original 1955 list were still on the list in 2015. Should we say that U.S. colleges are stuck or standing strong?\nWherever you stand on these examples, this much is clear: Executives should first mind the way they talk about change. Instead of calling an organization or person “resistant to change,” could you imagine calling it “resilient?” Perhaps doing so would help you see a dormant strength, or some untapped potential.\nOur ability to manage change thus begins with how we see it: as opportunity, problem, or both.\nSuccessfully managing change in the business also demands that the executive choose an appropriate pace of change for the people in it. “Knowledge, by definition, changes very fast,” Peter Drucker wrote. “And skills, by definition, change very slowly.” People, I would add, change more slowly still, if at all.\nThe same combination of forces that Lafley and Martin describe as driving consumer behavior (a strong value proposition plus habit-forming design) also drives employee behavior. Your people don’t want to think a lot about how they work. They want to think about it just enough to be sure they trust it; then they want to think about the work itself. If your system for staffing work is basically effective, then changing it too frequently will distract your employees and erode their ability to perform.\nThere is a tremendous, if largely invisible, cost to chasing management fads when your people could instead be getting their work done. Better to pursue cumulative advantage with your employees, just as if they are your customers: Change slowly through small-scale experimentation, and don’t roll out anything organization-wide until you have evidence that it works .\nIn short, and as Drucker put it, “change and continuity are poles rather than opposites.” Continuity is the fertile soil in which change takes root. The greater an employee’s or customer’s sense of continuity in the company’s brand, values and culture, the more receptive that employee or customer will be to change. Conversely, the harder it is for an employee or customer to find continuity, the harder it will be for any change to succeed.\nIt’s so easy to fall in love with change. But sometimes we need to take it slow.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:52:39.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
