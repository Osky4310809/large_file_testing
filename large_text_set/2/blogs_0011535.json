They can also take a geep look at the individual performances in the film, and that includes the most controversial casting of the MCU thus far, Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One. \nMake no mistake, her casting was a controversy; many Asian and those of Asian descent fans felt legitimately slighted to have a character, traditionally an aged Tibetan man, played by a white woman (but still teaching in Tibet). It's a controversy that Marvel Studios has acknowledged, from the director of Doctor Strange , Scott Derrickson, to producers and executives. It's also one that seems to have come from a good place on Derrickson's part - his stated intention was not to whitewash the character, it was to subvert the stereotypes the Ancient One is beholden to. \nRegardless, the casting has come off as a misstep, though many enjoyed the actual performance , including Swinton's castmates. \n\"When you really boil down the true essence of the Ancient One,\" actor Benedict Wong told Comicbook.com, \"this ethereal, timeless quality, there is no actor or actress quite like Tilda Swinton to play that. I think it's a master stroke. She's just amazing.\" \nWong brought up the role and performance on his own, having also mentioned he thought Benedict Cumberbatch \"did a fantastic job\" and was the only person he could think of to lead the film. \nNext, Wong joins the cast of Avengers: Infinity War , reprising his role as Master Wong as most of the characters from the MCU thus far are brought together to battle Thanos. You can watch him in Doctor Strange on Digital HD now, and on Blu-ray and DVD in two weeks. \nMORE Doctor Strange News:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:15:23.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
