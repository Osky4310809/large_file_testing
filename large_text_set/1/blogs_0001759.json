Though Monáe has never been afraid to approach a new trend, or experiment with unique pieces, there is one constant that runs through her eclectic wardrobe. Sticking to the color scheme of black and white (and the occasional hint of gray), Monáe and her stylist, Maeve Reilly, create a striking and completely distinctive look. Other singers may play with poppy shades and kaleidoscopic prints, but Monáe keeps things simple, graphic, and delightfully offbeat in a deliberately limited palette. \nThough she’s worn some variant of her monochromatic look for years, Monáe kicked things into high gear during the press tour for her latest film, Hidden Figures . Whether she was stepping out in wide-leg striped pants from Tome at yesterday’s London screening, wearing a diamond-patterned Lela Rose dress to Variety ’s Creative Impact Awards, or arriving at the Palms Springs International Film Festival in sumptuous color-blocked Jenny Packham, Monáe stood out. Avoiding the usual red carpet suspects in favor quirky pieces that speak to her aesthetic, Monáe has become the rare celebrity whose look isn’t dictated by brand allegiance. Taking things full tilt by playing with her beauty signatures, Monáe decorates her hair with gold spirals, safety pins, and even googly eyes straight from the crafts store. When paired with a signature red lip, the hair accessories add caprice to each outfit and a sense of possibility. For a star who can turn even commonplace add-ons into conversation pieces, there are no style limitations. \nSo what’s the story behind Monáe’s colorless closet? The decision to wear fewer shades has a lot to do with the inspiring women in her life. “I’m a minimalist by heart, but a lot of it had to do with me wanting to have a uniform like the working class, like my mom and my grandmother,” Monáe told the Huffington Post back in 2013, explaining that her goal wasn’t just to be well-dressed but to have a uniform that connects her to her roots, too. Still staying true to that sentiment, Monáe has crafted one of Hollywood’s most individual wardrobes and a fashion sensibility that’s about more than a moment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:08:40.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
