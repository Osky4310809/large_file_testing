I'm happy working here and the people I'm working with.\" \nGuardiola takes his side to meet Everton on Sunday in what will be his second encounter with Ronald Koeman, his old team-mate at Barcelona. \nKoeman has struggled to muster consistent results since taking over at Goodison Park but Guardiola is in no doubt over the former Netherlands international's insight into the game. \n\"When I started playing at Barcelona I said many times, and will repeat it a thousand times, how important his advice was for me, especially on the pitch,\" he said. \"To see how he'd react playing football and his huge personality in the big games. \nSchneiderlin not angry at Mourinho \n\"He understood the game perfectly. When he was playing his position in the back four he would control and see everything. You could imagine he'd become a coach. \n\"We spoke many times when I was in Munich and now we're together [in England] we congratulate each other when we win. \n\"I am glad to be his friend.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:06:20.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
