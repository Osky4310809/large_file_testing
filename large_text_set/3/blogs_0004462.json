He was jailed for a year, during which time Gabbe wrote to him daily and visited him twice a week.\nSoon after his release, in January 2013, Gabbe found out she was pregnant.\nJustin was jailed for six years (Picture: Writeaprisoner.com) ‘At first Justin was pleased, but then he turned on me and started accusing me of all sorts of stupid things,’ she said. ‘He said I was unfaithful when he was in prison and even asked me to have an abortion, but I wouldn’t hear it.’\nAfter a fight one night, Gabbe ended up leaving at 4am to stay with a friend. Justin got back in touch with her and apologised profusely, but Gabbe had miscarried from the stress of the situation.\n‘I was devastated because, no matter what, I wanted this baby,’ she said, explaining that Justin became increasingly jealous. ‘Somehow we got back together again but things were never the same.’\nGabbe left Justin again in May 2013, sick of his accusations and temper – but he bombarded her with texts, threatening to ‘throw boulders through the window’ if she ignored him.\nHowever he managed to worm his way back into her life when Gabbe thought she was pregnant again. She said he was ‘the best he had ever been – he was back to being the guy I fell in love with’.\nBut things took a turn for the worse when she realised she wasn’t actually pregnant.\nGabbe was tortured by Justin for a week (Picture: Facebook/Gabbe Rowland) ‘It was June 29 and he picked me up from work,’ she said. ‘He was like a different person again. He pulled me by the hair and accused me of cheating. I was screaming and crying and wouldn’t admit to anything.\n‘The next day he picked me up from a friend’s and I thought we would go off to talk. Instead, he pulled into a quiet place in the car and said, “Give me your arm and make a fist”. Horrified, I pulled away because I knew exactly what he wanted me to do.’\nWoman who grew up with Westboro Baptist Church explains why she left He pushed a vial of heroin into Gabbe’s arm, which ‘affected her horribly’ because she had never taken drugs in her life. Over the course of the next week, he forcibly injected her two to three times a day, after which she would always throw up.\n‘I felt that this was his way of keeping me down, of humiliating me,’ she said.\nOne day he drove her into a wood, beat her and raped her. Another day, in the early hours of the morning at around 2am, he brought his pet pitbull into the room and forced her to ‘give the dog oral sex’ while he filmed her – ‘one of the most degrading things he made her do’.\nJustin then made her clean her teeth before he orally raped her.\nThe facts: Domestic abuse in the UK One in four women experience domestic abuse in their lives. For men, this figure is one in six. Two women are killed by a current or former partner every week in England and Wales. Globally, one in three women have experienced sexual or physical violence – in most cases from a partner or family member. Around 54 per cent of rapes reported to police take place within the context of domestic violence. Every minute a domestic violence case is reported to police. But… Only 35 per cent of domestic violence cases are actually reported to the police. Sources: Refuge , nia \nOn July 5, when Gabbe finally managed to make it into work, her boss noticed her bruises and took her to one side – at which point she broke down and revealed what had been happening. She agreed to leave Justin and seek shelter in a refuge, after going to the police.\nIn March 2014, Justin was found guilty of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery, malicious destruction of property and witness intimidation, and was given a six-year prison sentence.\nGabbe said: ‘I was relieved, but I think the sentence should have been longer. He tortured me for a week. He could easily have killed me with the heroin, or he could have beaten me to death as he promised he would.’\nNow Gabbe works in a doctor’s office, and speaks openly about her experiences to help other women in abusive situations.\n‘I wish I had left him many times, but I didn’t because I always thought things would work out – and there were always the threats that he would hurt me.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T12:00:39.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
