We need to throw them in earlier. \n“It’s tough in our league. \n“I have to do what I preach - if a young player shows something special I’m not going to wait too long to expose them in the national team and encourage them. No McGree, it's not a joke 0:49 \n“Particularly with young players – between age 18-21 - they don’t play enough senior football and in many respects that destroys many carers or hampers ability to play higher level. \n“Unfortunately that’s the space we’re in. \n“For my perspective, I’ve had my radar up for a while to give a young kid an opportunity. \n“I’ve done it in the past, (for example) with Daniel De Silva, but they’ve suffered from a lack of game time. \n“Hopefully Riley’s (selection) means … maybe Adelaide will give him an extended run and others in a similar age group start hopefully people take things more seriously. \n“It’s about ambition, I don’t want people who are going to settle for their lot because of an age bracket – I’m looking for guys who want to grab it and I want to incentivise that.” \nLast week, Postecoglou foreshadowed that McGree’s selection in the 30 was not a token. \nHe has threatened that again after he made the cut again. \n“No, he’s there to contribute. If he does well at training he can play … if he looks like he’s adjusted well at training and looks bright we won’t be afraid to throw him in either.” \nMore realistically, he is there to be examined, and to send a message, and the timing of this camp is the best opportunity for that to happen given the A-League is finished by the time the Brazil match rolls around.
