Eric Greitens has promised to sign. \nGreitens’ stance on right-to-work has been at the heart of the argument. Democrats have tried to put the issue before voters through a referendum clause, but Republicans said voters spoke loudly and clearly on the matter when they elected Greitens and other GOP candidates. \nDemocrats countered that those candidates were pressured by political donors like David Humphreys, a Joplin businessman who donated millions to those who supported the effort, including Greitens. \nSpeaking before the vote, Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh said the law would undermine Missouri’s middle class. \n“They built this state,” said Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors. “To undermine them by passing this legislation is appalling and unbecoming of this hallowed body.” \n“Sides have been chosen,” she went on. “Any appeal to rational thought, evidence or policy implications stands small against the millions in dark money that have bought this issue passage.” \nUnions like the AFL-CIO contend that the government has no place in negotiations between employers and employees. But the GOP-led Legislature has long tried to end “forced unionism,” with past efforts blocked by former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. \nSen. Ryan Silvey, the most outspoken opponent of right-to-work among Senate Republicans, maintained it was unfair for workers to reap benefits from collective bargaining without paying for it. \n“The ones who aren’t paying dues are basically freeloading off the union and the benefits negotiated for them,” Silvey said. \nA similar right-to-work proposal already passed the Missouri House last week, in a decisive 101-58 vote. \nBoth the House and Senate bills prohibit labor contracts that require all workers who benefit from union representation to pay union dues. But the Senate bill includes a grandfather clause, which protects labor contracts negotiated before the law takes effect, until they expire on their own. \nThe Senate bill needs another vote before it is approved, and the two versions would need to be reconciled before heading to the governor’s desk. \nWithout the votes to block the bill’s passage in the Senate, opponents on Wednesday attempted to attach amendments to the bill that would mitigate some of their concerns, including some limiting civil and criminal penalties for those who violate the law, but they were defeated. \nThe bill won initial approval on a 21-12 vote. \nRepublicans who voted against the bill were Sens. Silvey, Gary Romine and Paul Wieland. Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nBe informed. Get our free political newsletter featuring local and national updates and analysis.
