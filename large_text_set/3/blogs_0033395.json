The actor is leading one of two crowd funding campaigns aimed at buying then selling the internet browsing histories of America’s top politicos. Another activist from Tennessee raised more than $165,000 from more than 10,736 people. The privacy rules were set to protect against service providers like Comcast and Verizon using customer web-browsing data for marketing purposes. Now that SJR34 has been approved, there’s nothing to stop providers from using your private browsing data.

The privacy rules were put in place to prevent service providers like Comcast and Verizon from gaining access to customer web-browsing data for marketing purposes. \nThe repeal was backed by Verizon, AT&T and Comcast, who argued that ISPs were unfairly subjected to stricter privacy laws than companies like Google or Facebook. The effort is mostly symbolic. As some reports have already indicated, carriers are not allowed to sell individual web histories. Still, you gotta give our favorite angel props for harping on the right thing. \nRead original story ‘Supernatural’ Star Misha Collins Raises $70K to Buy Donald Trump’s and Congress’ Internet History  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:00:08.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
