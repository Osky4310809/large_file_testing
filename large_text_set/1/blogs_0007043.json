\nAguero brought a fine save from Adrian from the resulting corner and City’s pressure was rewarded in the 33rd minute. \nPablo Zabaleta, usually a right-back, was deployed in City’s midfield and the Argentine took advantage of a rare chance to get forward when he surged onto Silva’s reverse pass and went to ground after the slightest contact from Angelo Ogbonna. \nWest Ham complained Zabaleta had dived, but Toure ignored the fuss as the Ivory Coast midfielder emphatically dispatched the spot-kick. \nAt times this season, City have had an alarming habit of switching off at the back and Michail Antonio nearly took advantage of another lapse in concentration when he raced clear, only to see Willy Caballero palm his shot to Sofiane Feghouli, who somehow fired wide of the open goal. media_camera West Ham's Sofiane Feghouli lies in the goal after a missing an open goal. \nThat proved West Ham’s last chance of making City sweat as Guardiola’s side stepped on the gas to kill off the tie. \nIn the 42nd minute, City doubled their lead when Toure was allowed time and space for cross that was turned into his own net by Nordtveit under pressure from Sterling. \nJust 60 seconds later, the visitors punished more slack West Ham defending to deliver the knockout blow as Silva was left all alone to control Sterling’s cross and take a clever touch to deceive Adrian before slotting into the empty net. \nCity weren’t finished yet and Aguero was on the scoresheet five minutes after half-time when the Argentina star turned in Toure’s shot to take him to third on his club’s all-time scoring list and send West Ham fans streaming to the exits in droves. \nWith City in complete control there was an air of an exhibition match about the closing stages, but there was still time for Stones, who was signed from Everton for $85m, to score his first goal for the club with an 84th minute header from Nolito’s corner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:28:48.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
