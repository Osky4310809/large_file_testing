The father was sentenced to four months in jail, the mother to three months of house arrest.\nProsecutors are appealing those sentences, while the couple has appealed their guilty verdicts, arguing at a hearing last week the judge failed to provide them a fair trial.\nDavid Rossiter/The Canadian Press David and Collet Stephan leave the courthouse in Lethbridge, Alberta, on April 26, after being found guilty in the death of their 19-month-old son, Ezekiel. As the trial ended, 43 physicians from across the country wrote to the college asking it to investigate Tannis’s role in the affair, arguing no health professional should treat a sick child without first examining them.\nEvidence was less than clear about what she did or did not do in the hours before Ezekiel was rushed to hospital by ambulance.\nThe naturopath testified that a mother called the Lethbridge Naturopathic Medical Clinic and indicated her baby might have meningitis and was interested in something to boost his immune system. Tannis told court that she instructed an employee to tell the woman she should take Ezekiel immediately to hospital, and never met her in person.\nStephan came separately to the clinic asking for an immune-boosting remedy for her sick child – who at that point was so stiff he had to be laid out in her car’s back seat. One witness told the trial she met with the naturopath , then bought an Echinacea product called “Boost.”\nThe college said “multiple witnesses” report that Tannis immediately recommended a trip to emergency when she heard a patient might have meningitis.\n“Dr. Tannis is fully aware of her abilities, competencies and limitations as a naturopathic practitioner, and will not hesitate to refer patients to other health care providers when necessary, ” the agency said in a letter explaining its decision.\nWhat’s more, when the mother did actually come in to the clinic, she was alone and did not ask the naturopath about her son, while Tannis was unaware she was the same parent with a child who might have meningitis, the college said.\nRelated Convicted for using natural remedies to treat dying son, father back promoting alternative medicine Alberta naturopath faces investigation after parents convicted in toddler’s meningitis death Alberta naturopath faces investigation after parents convicted in toddler’s meningitis death The parents “readily admitted that they did not take their son Ezekiel into the (clinic) to see Dr. Tannis.”\nMichelle Cohen, the Brighton, Ont., family doctor who filed the complaint on behalf of her colleagues, says she can accept that the naturopath had no idea the Echinacea product was for a possible meningitis patient – if the college has established that fact with “a high degree of confidence.”\nBut she said the college was “pedantically specific” in just focusing on Tannis’s actions in the case, and should have issued a general warning against naturopaths peddling herbal treatments, which she called “non-medically necessary.”\n“They completely ignored their greater responsibility to the public to deal with the question of selling herbal products out of a naturopathic clinic,” said Cohen. “They need to address the conflict of interest issue as well as the issue of professional responsibility if a product sold by a naturopath results in a poor health outcome.”\nDespite the paucity of scientific evidence behind many herbal medicines, however, they make up a significant part of the treatment offered by naturopaths, who are now licensed by several provincial governments.\n• Email: tblackwell@postmedia.com | Twitter: tomblackwellNP \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T06:48:01.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
