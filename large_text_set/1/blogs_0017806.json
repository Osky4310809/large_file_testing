Now the head of its biggest rival, Hulu , has confirmed that plans are in the works to add download support for its library of films and TV episodes.\nSee also: Best video streaming apps and video streaming services for Android December 4, 2016 In an interview with Adweek , Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins confirmed that download support is on its way for Hulu subscribers. He stated:\nYes, it’s definitely on our road map. It’s something that we’re going be doing in a few months. We’re working hard on the technology around that and getting the rights squared away.\nHaving offline support for watching Hulu movies and TV shows will be a huge benefit for phone owners with limited cellular data plans. The ability to download Hulu’s library of videos at home on a Wi-Fi connection to watch later on the road where data is limited and sometimes spotty is going to be a welcome one.\nThe streaming service is also working on its previously-announced plans to launch a streaming cable TV service similar to Sling TV , PlayStation Vue and DirecTV Now . Hulu is still trying to secure agreements with a number of cable TV sources but it is sticking with its plans to launch the service sometime in 2017. It will include support for a cloud-based DVR, which will allow people to record live TV for viewing later without the need for a set-top box.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T04:41:01.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
