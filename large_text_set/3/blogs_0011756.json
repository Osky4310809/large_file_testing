The actress has been steeping out in her cool-girl gear, choosing to consciously underdress at events that call for a deck-up routine. We aren’t sure if this is a sartorial statement (although we are a hundred percent on board with this layering-meets-affordable-separates situation), or a passing dress-down phase. Either way, we are hella inspired. Here’s your lowdown on her totally practical outfits. \n1.A while back, at the most celeb-validating party of the town (Manish Malhotra’s birthday party hosted by bestie, Karan Johar), amid a pool of decidedly OTT leading ladies, Kriti confidently emerged in a Free People velvet dress that kept a safe distance from her Steve Madden thigh-high boots. And, that is how you dress-down to have fun at parties. kritisanon/via Instagram 2.Her airport style, too, is refreshingly believable. Like this one here, where she was photographed wearing leather-cum-denim overalls over a full-sleeved striped top, both from the TommyXGigi collection by Tommy Hilfiger. 3.Resultantly, the actress has been spotted in cool girl-verified brands. Her appearance in this patched Doodlage striped dress, paired with converse sneakers and a designer tote, ranks high on our to-wear list. afashionistadiaries/via Instagram 4.The key to dressing down is to layer up, which is what Kriti demonstrates in this ultra-chic outfit, featuring a Bershka top over a plain white tee, and dramatically flared jeans. This outfit also goes on to prove that flared jeans are a definitive must-have. \n5.In case you were wondering how to wear a dress without looking like a mini party, let Kriti’s belted version of this H&M dress help you get there. \n6.And lastly, we leave this outfit that is near-flawless sum of lazy-girl-dressing, pro-layering and off-beat designers. This effortless transition of a black leather slip, with a single addition of a long denim coat, is all kinds of inspiring. sukritigrover/via Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T05:07:45.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
