We're committed to it.\" \nTrump on Monday issued a new executive order that replaces his travel ban from late January that barred refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days while vetting procedures are reviewed. \nThe original travel ban was blocked by federal courts, but only after chaos ensued at some airports as about 60,000 visa holders and others previously approved for U.S. travel were denied entry. \nTrump's new executive order removes Iraq from the list of affected countries, and makes an exception for those who already have visas from the Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. But the order keeps in place a 120-day ban on refugees from any country. \nMelara said the new refugee ban, effective March 16, means that Catholic Charities of Onondaga County will likely go four months without any federal aid for its refugee resettlement program. The aid provides about $900 per refugee. \n\"Our biggest challenge is to navigate through the 120-day period without any program income,\" Melara said. \nAnticipating the funding cuts, Catholic Charities has instituted a hiring freeze for its refugee resettlement program, cut back staff hours by 5 percent, and reassigned some of is 50 resettlement workers to other programs \n\"Through those strategies, we have not had to lay off any staff,\" Melara said. \"We don't want to decimate the program so we won't be able to resettle people once the program resumes.\" \nCatholic Charities is also seeking alternative funding sources, including foundation grants and state aid. A group of state Assembly members has asked for $12 million in funding for agencies that resettle refugees in Upstate New York. About 94 percent of the 5,028 refugees who settled in the state in 2016 did so in Upstate. \nTrump's order also reduces the number of refugees who can be admitted into the United States this year to 50,000, down from 110,000 last year. But Melara said he expects Catholic Charities of Onondaga County to continue to resettle about 600 refugees per year. \n\"Of all the issues we're dealing with, the big issue will be going from 110,000 to 50,000,\" Melara said. \"That has political, moral and all kinds of issues connected to that decision, which is unilaterally made by the chief executive, the president.\" \nContact Mark Weiner anytime: | Twitter | Facebook | 571-970-3751 More Politics & Elections", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:54:54.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
