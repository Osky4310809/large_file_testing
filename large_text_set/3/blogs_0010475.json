By Amy Zimmer | March 13, 2017 10:56am View Full Caption DNAinfo/Eddie Small \nMANHATTAN â€“ With major storm expected to blanket the city on Tuesday â€” up to 20 inches of snow and wind gusts up to 40 mph â€” many parents and teachers want to know ahead of time whether schools will remain open. \nFamilies took to Twitter to urge the city to make the call as soon as possible. Can @NYCSchools go ahead and call this snow day now and save us all the stress of having to make changes and plans last minute?? ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ â€” Matt Ryan (@matty_d31) March 13, 2017 \nNo final decision on school closures had yet been made as of 10:45 a.m. Monday, Department of Education officials said. \nIn the most recent snowstorm last month, Mayor Bill de Blasio made the call to close schools the night before, sending out a tweet from the Department of Education at 6:43 p.m. on Feb. 8 that schools would be closed on Feb. 9. Approximately 10 inches of snow fell in some parts of the city that day. \nThat decision to make an early call came after de Blasio took heat for his decision to keep schools open during a major snowstorm in February 2014 â€” much to the ire of many parents and teachers forced to navigate treacherous roads. \nSchools Chancellor Carmen Farina argued at the time that for many children, school was the only place they could get a hot lunch and that it should be up to parents to decide whether or not to send their kids to class. \nCHECK BACK FOR MORE UPDATES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T17:33:25.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
