School District: Policies Will ‘Not Change’ Despite Trump Administration Transgender Bathroom Decision \nThe letter — which does not offer new guidance but simply withdraws the Obama administration policy — says there must be “due regard” for the role of states and local school districts in shaping education policy in schools. \n“We have a responsibility to protect every student in America and ensure that they have the freedom to learn and thrive in a safe and trusted environment,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement. “This is not merely a federal mandate, but a moral obligation no individual, school, district or state can abdicate. At my direction, the department’s Office for Civil Rights remains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools.” \nOne source outside of government who said he’s familiar with DeVos’ thinking on the plans told CNN, “this is not what Betsy wanted to do.” \nShe communicated that first to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the source said. She was then summoned to the White House on Tuesday for a meeting with Sessions and President Donald Trump, where she was told to agree to the plans. \n“It was the President’s decision,” the source said. \nDeVos reminded Trump that both he and she had publicly promised to protect all students. \nShe felt that this was not in accordance with those promises. She did ask for additional language to put in the letter that affirmed that students would still be protected and the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights would investigate issues. \nHer concern was that some people may interpret it as removing protections. \n“When the President tells you to do something you don’t want to do, that is a hard spot to be in,” the source said. \nThe-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
