The seashell palette, aptly named Mermaid Life Palette , comes with seven creamy colors in foil finish and two different highlights, including a matte shade to help you unleash your inner mermaid. Some of the vibrant eye shadow colors include gold, blue, burnt orange, green, and purple.\nIf you want to get your fins on this, you'll have to preorder the palette before 8 p.m. PT on March 15. You'll also receive a free mermaid brush to match your new seashell eye palette made out of recycled materials.\nRead on to see swatches of every single eye shadow even Princess Ariel would obsess over.\nRelated:\nWe Can't Wait to Get Our Fins — Er, Hands — on These Mermaid Makeup Brushes\nA post shared by SauceBox cosmetics (@sauceboxcosmetics) on Mar 14, 2017 at 1:14am PDT\n💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🌊🌊🌊🙌🙌🙌\nA post shared by SauceBox cosmetics (@sauceboxcosmetics) on Mar 15, 2017 at 3:25pm PDT", "external_links": ["https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/17333953_1812555169066021_1421147559476330496_n.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRrOs2HFnx9/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRnIfRVFGdp/", "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/17333603_1651916701779834_1959992747683217408_n.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRnIfRVFGdp/?taken-by=sauceboxcosmetics", "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/e15/17333928_1152138251561877_7874222019183640576_n.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRrNB2ZlFtf/"], "published": "2017-03-16T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T07:24:12.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
