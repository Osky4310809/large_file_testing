Michigan Democratic Party lawmakers are now banding together to end the taxation of the feminine hygiene product in the state after bipartisan efforts to do so in the past have stalled. In the past year, both Democrats and Republicans have introduced bills addressing the tax but none went to vote, reports the Detroit Free Press . Democrats have attempted to amend standing and future bills with the elimination of the tax but they too were stalled. The tax became a national issue in 2015 after writer and activist Jennifer Weiss-Wolf worked alongside Cosmopolitan to bring attention to the fact sales tax is applied to menstrual items because they’re not considered a medical necessity. A Change.org petition started by Weiss-Wolf and Cosmopolitan has seen renewed interest. The issue galvanized women’s rights organizations in pressuring elected officials to bring more light to the tax. Opponents of the tampon tax highlight that certain over-the-counter medical items, such as in Texas where ibuprofen and select dietary supplements, are exempt from sales tax. In Colorado, pregnancy tests are not slammed with sales tax. Activists against the tax say that the extra monies spent to procure menstrual products puts poor women in danger of deeper financial worry. Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Connecticut have all made tampons exempt from sales tax and Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon do not have sales tax at all so they’ve been in the clear on the issue. California lawmakers passed a bill that would have stripped the tax but it was vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:58:00.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
