All of these actions, Hoffa said, are good for the American worker. \n\"I mean, he's only been in since Friday and look what's happened,\" Hoffa said. \"I mean, it's â€” he's done amazing things.\" Mack Hogan Special to CNBC.com Playing", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:21:39.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
