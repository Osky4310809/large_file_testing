Facebook/Peter Tiu Laviña \nMANILA, Philippines - It was a painful decision, but President Duterte admitted yesterday that he fired his friend Peter Laviña as National Irrigation Administration chief following reports of corruption in the NIA. \n“I just fired one (official) last week,” he told reporters in Cordova, Cebu. “Alam mo, ganito ang usapan: ‘Sama tayo sa gobyerno pero malinis ito ha’ (You know, this is the deal, we join the government but we should be clean), this is not for profit, huwag niyo ako hiyain. Pag hiniya niyo ako, hiwalay hiwalay tayo (Don’t embarass me. If you embarass me, we will part ways).” \n“I told him to resign,” Duterte said. \nAlthough he did not name the official, only Laviña has resigned in recent days. \nDuterte, when asked if he was hurt by his decision, replied, “Yes, of course.” \nDuterte explained that he had made clear since the start of his term that he would not tolerate corruption even among his closest allies.   \nIn his second speech last night, Duterte also referred to his “close associate” whom he asked to “go quietly” due to suggestions of corruption. \n“The first whiff or suggestion of corruption, let’s part ways,” he said. \nDuterte reiterated that he has made a commitment to the Filipino people to give them a respite from corruption, at least during his term. He said he wanted to at least reduce corruption to the “barest minimum” if possible. Probe set \nCabinet Secretary Leoncio Evasco Jr. assured the public yesterday that an investigation would be conducted regarding reports that Laviña allegedly asked for 40 percent kickbacks from contractors. \nEvasco said his office is saddened by Laviña’s resignation. \nHe cited the changes that Laviña had initiated at NIA. \nEvasco said that nobody has come forward to file charges against Laviña, who is an ally of President Duterte. \n“To date, we have not received any formal complaint against administrator Lavina and other involved NIA officials,” he said. \nEvasco also issued a statement reiterating that his office will conduct an investigation into the reported corrupt practices at the agency. \n“Rest assured that the Office of the Cabinet Secretary will still look into these allegations against NIA officials. Cases will be filed if these allegations are proven true. Officials will be preventively suspended, if warranted. Personnel will be reshuffled, if needed,” he said. \nEvasco also urged the people who have knowledge of corrupt practices at NIA or any government agency to come out in the open. \n“We ask people to be vigilant and to protect our government institution from being corrupted by its officials and from being destroyed by scheming interested parties,” he said. \n“Let us defend and help rebuild our institutions. Get rid of corruption in the ranks of our government officials,” he added. \n“He (Laviña) resigned to spare President Duterte from the intrigues of corruption being thrown at him. He was alleged to have been favoring contractors and receiving money from them, even if we have been told that, on record, no bidding for big ticket projects was held during his stay as administrator,” Evasco said. \nEvasco said he is surprised why Laviña was caught in the controversy when he issued memorandum circulars requiring strict adherence to the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act 9184 (Government Procurement Act). \n“His official acts are in contrast with the acts he is being accused of. He prohibited contractors who incurred negative slippage from participating in the procurement. He also reconstituted the NIA Contract Termination Review Committee to ensure strict adherence to rules and to deter contractors from failing in their contractual obligations,” he added. \nIt was during Laviña’s term when the NIA board approved the guidelines on the NIA Free Irrigation Act for CY 2017. \nWhile Congress is still deliberating on a bill to provide free irrigation, NIA is already implementing it in excess of what is mandated by the special provision in the General Appropriations Act. \nAccording to Evasco, NIA also recognizes that all its farmer beneficiaries should be treated equal. The benefits of free irrigation should not only be enjoyed by farmers in the NIS, but by all qualified users of NIA facilities. \n“The Office of the Cabinet Secretary already instructed the NIA management to implement schemes to further ensure wider public access and transparency in the conduct of bidding, especially for big ticket projects in the Central Office. This includes online live video streaming of all public biddings in NIA,” he said. \nIn addition, Evasco added that the NIA would use a bigger venue during the conduct of bidding to accommodate more observers, including the media. \n“The public will be updated on the bidding process by posting, via NIA website, matters which maybe lawfully disclosed. We will redefine the meaning of ‘public’ and ‘transparency’ in bidding government contracts,” the Palace official said. \nPresidential spokesman Ernesto Abella reminded public servants that all government appointees should not tolerate any hint of corruption. \nAbella cited Laviña, who had to leave his post following allegations of corruption in the agency. \nAs Duterte had vowed that there would be no corruption under his administration, Abella said all presidential appointees should ensure that they would follow the President’s order to the letter. \n“Mr. Laviña may have his own take on this matter, as he is entitled to his opinion, but at the end of the day, public service must brook no hint of corruption, any intimation of which must be faced squarely and without favor,” Abella said a day after Malacañang confirmed that Duterte had accepted Laviña’s resignation. \n“Only then can we move forward, towards a well functioning government, towards a nation worthy of our people. And a people worthy of the nation,” he said. \nThe other day, Laviña said he resigned to spare the President from embarrassment due to attempts by certain sectors to destroy his reputation. – With Ding Cervantes, Edith Regalado  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:44:58.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
