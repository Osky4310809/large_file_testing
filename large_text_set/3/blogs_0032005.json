Sad!’: GOP Pols Fire Back After Trump’s Freedom Caucus Attack by Joe DePaolo | 12:30 pm, March 30th, 2017 \nEarlier, we posted about a Thursday morning tweet from President Donald Trump in which he said “we must fight” the Freedom Caucus. The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don’t get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017 \nThe tweet comes a few days after the caucus helped prevent the GOP’s health care plan , the American Health Care Act, from reaching a vote on the House floor. \nNow, Freedom Caucus members and other GOP politicians are firing back, suggesting a possible division in the party, which would serve as a major impediment to Trump’s legislative agenda. \nAppearing on Fox News Thursday, Freedom Caucus member Jim Jordan (R-OH) said the group would not back down following the Trump tweet. \n“The Freedom Caucus is trying to change Washington,” he said. “This bill keeps Washington the same, plain and simple.” \nHe added: “We appreciate the president, we’re trying to help the president. But the fact is you’ve got to look at the legislation, and it doesn’t do what we told the voters we would do.” \nFreedom Caucus member Congressman Justin Amash (R-MI) was less diplomatic in his response: It didn’t take long for the swamp to drain @realDonaldTrump . No shame, Mr. President. Almost everyone succumbs to the D.C. Establishment. https://t.co/9bDo8yzH7I \n— Justin Amash (@justinamash) March 30, 2017 \nCongressman Thomas Massie (R-KY), though not a Freedom Caucus member, was one of the most vocal House members against the American Health Care Act. He also backed the caucus on Twitter as well. . @realDonaldTrump it’s a swamp not a hot tub. We both came here to drain it. #SwampCare polls 17%. Sad! https://t.co/4kjygV2tdS \n— Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) March 30, 2017 \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ] \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \nHave a tip we should know?
