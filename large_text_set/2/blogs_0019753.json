( VZ ) and Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO ) announced Tuesday amended terms to their merger agreement in which Yahoo lowered its asking price by $350 million, valuing the deal at $4.48 billion. Originally Verizon had agreed to pay $4.8 billion for Yahoo’s core internet assets. \nIn a press release, the companies said that in addition to the reduction in the deal price tag, the two companies agreed to share in legal and regulatory liabilities that come from the data breaches at Yahoo that potentially impacted around 1.5 billion customer accounts. Liability Issues Resolved \n\"We have always believed this acquisition makes strategic sense. We look forward to moving ahead expeditiously so that we can quickly welcome Yahoo's tremendous talent and assets into our expanding portfolio in the digital advertising space ,\" said Marni Walden, Verizon’s executive vice president and president of product innovation and new businesses in a statement. \"The amended terms of the agreement provide a fair and favorable outcome for shareholders. It provides protections for both sides and delivers a clear path to close the transaction in the second quarter.\" \nUnder the revised deal, Yahoo will be on the hook for 50 percent of any cash liabilities that arise after the deal closes and is related to non- Securities and Exchange Commission investigations and third-party lawsuits over the breaches. Yahoo will cover the full responsibility for shareholder lawsuits and from SEC investigations. The new deal terms also call for the data breaches, or the losses that arise from them, to not be taken into account when determining whether a “business material adverse effect” has occurred or whether certain closing conditions have been met. Speculation Can Be Put to Bed \nLast week, reports surfaced that Verizon and Yahoo were nearing a revised deal in which the price tag would get reduced and Yahoo would share in any future burden from its data hacks. The announcement Tuesday puts to bed questions about the fate of the deal that have been ongoing since Yahoo announced a series of data breaches last year. (See also: Verizon: No Timeframe for Close of Yahoo Deal .) \nIn September, Yahoo disclosed the first of two massive breaches, revealing that a \"state-sponsored actor\" stole information from as many as 500 million user accounts. Yahoo said the stolen information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and hashed passwords. That breach happened in 2014. In December, Yahoo disclosed another larger breach of potentially 1 billion user accounts. In that case, the breach occurred in 2013. In late January, The Wall Street Journal reported the SEC launched an investigation into the timing of Yahoo’s disclosures of the breaches and whether or not Yahoo should have alerted investors sooner. The SEC requires companies to disclose breaches of cybersecurity as soon as the company determines the attacks could have an impact on its investors. Last week, Yahoo disclosed yet another data breach, which it attributed to a state-sponsored perpetrator.
