Today, the company confirmed that the Mate 9 Pro and Porsche Design Mate 9 phones from Huawei, along with the ZTE Axon 7 , will all be updated with support for Daydream apps in the near future.\nSee also: Launch day: Daydream VR apps roundup November 10, 2016 These three phones join the already announced ASUS ZenFone AR , which will have both Daydream and Tango augmented reality support when it launches later in 2017.\n\nIn addition, Huawei is also working on its own smartphone VR headset that will be compatible with any Daydream app. Google stated the headset will have a 95 degree field of view, along with an adjustable focus so it can be used without eyeglasses. This will be the first third-party headset to support Daydream; Google has been selling its own DayDream View headsets since November for $79. Huawei’s headset will only be sold in China.\nThere’s no word on when the new Huawei VR headset will go on sale, nor is there any info on what its price tag will be. Nevertheless, we strongly suspect that it should land somewhere around the price of Google’s headset. All of this would seem to bode well for the Daydream platform as a whole, and we expect more Android smartphone makers will join this group in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:42:11.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
