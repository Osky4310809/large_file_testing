In an industry that is constantly changing, friendship between these two is very heartening to see. They have had their ups and downs, but always bounce back as even better friends. While we always knew they had a great rapport, a recent series of tweets between the SRK and KJo has proven that they are #BFFGoals. Karan put out a tweet praising Shah Rukh's performance in Raees , and the team of the film, which spawned a hilarious back-and-forth between him and the actor. Ranging from Karan making an action or sports film, to revelations that Shah Rukh directed the basketball scenes in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai , the conversation will most definitely make you laugh out loud.
