The couple is now legally separated. The announcement of their separation came about last year in August. Reports suggested, Vijay’s parents constant interference caused the couple to go separate ways, while other reports stated Amala Paul insistence to work despite her in-laws disapproval drove the couple to this decision. There was also Amala Paul’s alleged closeness to another star that came up among the many reasons. Soon after, Vijay released an official statement clarifying everything – “I have been reading a plenty of news on the separation of me and Amala based on random assumptions and false information. I would like to make it clear that the only truth in that is the separation rest all is untrue. The reason behind the separation is unknown to anyone but me. Many of my best friends and well-wishers in this industry, including media friends, were insisting me to speak out. But I thought discussing my private life in public would do no good to the cause.” Amala Paul-AL Vijay’s split came as a shock to the industry as their love story was nothing short of a fairytale. They had met on the sets of Deiva Thirumagal in 2011. After dating for three years, they had got married in a grand ceremony in June 2014.
