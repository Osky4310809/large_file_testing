Fletcher said he had to leave United — but will be back with West Brom on Saturday (Photo: Getty) \n“I probably surprised him in pre-season and that enabled me to stay when a lot of other players left. But ultimately, I couldn’t stay and not play. \n“I would have been a bit-part player. That’s what I was for six months and it was really getting to me. \n\"It wasn’t a case of me being patient, I just couldn’t see a way of out it. \n\"I needed a new challenge.” poll loading Did Man United make a mistake selling Welbeck? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:51:30.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
