Philip Hadlow has auditioned for the show a number of times (Photo: Ian Scammell/KentLive) \nWhen asked why he thought he had the X Factor, he told them: \"Various people over the years have said, 'Oh you've got a strong good voice'.\" \nHis rendition of Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up didn't impress the judges though. \nHe stumbled through the words and didn't even make it to the chorus before Simon raised his hand and said: \"This isn't working\". \nAnother familiar face who went along to sing for producers was Hercules Smith, who was recently seen on Gary Barlow's rival talent show, Let It Shine. Hercules Smith has also been seen on Let It Shine (Photo: Ian Scammell/KentLive) The turn-out in Margate wasn't great (Photo: LMacDougall/KentLive) \nThe 34-year-old, who grew up in South Africa, was five weeks into the process to find a boy band to star in Gary's new musical before being sent home. \nHe told Kent Live: \"I was fortunate enough to get as far as I did but I didn't really suit what they were looking for. I'm more of an operatic classical singer, and I suppose my age played a part in that too. But they gave me a chance and I sung my heart out.\" \nHe added: \"Let it Shine was my stepping stone but I don't think it was the right competition for me. \n\"Looking at the X Factor, Saara Alto that was on there – she has a big voice – and I also think that I can sing a whole lot of genres with the voice that I have.\" \nMirror Online has contacted The X Factor for comment and to ask how many people auditioned in Margate.
