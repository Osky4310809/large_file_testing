Waters believes and the Trump voters she clearly viewed as her real enemy.   \nFor starters, did you know that she had a soft spot in her heart for late Cuban dictator and mass murderer Fidel Castro? “Viva Fidel!” she proudly chanted in 2000 after the dictator spoke at a church in Harlem, according to Townhall . \nMost Trump voters don’t support the Cuban dictatorship. \nIt appears Waters also has an affinity for cop killers. After she voted in favor of a resolution calling for the extradition of the cop killer known Assata Shakur from Cuba in 1998, she wrote an apology letter to Castro claiming essentially that she had not realized Shakur — whose real name was Joanne Chesimard — was a beloved cop kiler. \n“I, and some of the Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, mistakenly voted for House Concurrent Resolution 254 which called on the Government of Cuba to extradite to the United States Joanne Chesimard and all other individuals who have fled the United States from political persecution and received political asylum in Cuba,” she wrote.
