The change, first noticed by Emojipedia , makes Windows the first major platform to support the characters.\nSEE ALSO: The ultimate guide to the 104 new emoji in iOS 10.2 \nSupport for the new characters was quietly added in the latest preview build for the upcoming Windows 10 Creators update. We say quietly because the characters aren't yet officially part of Windows' emoji keyboard, but they are supported when you manually copy and paste them.\nWith the update, users are able to change the skin tone for each person in the emoji couple, opening up a total of 144 variations. \n\nImage: emojipedia\nAs Emojipedia editor Jeremy Burge notes, this is still an early build of the update so it's not clear whether Microsoft will make the changes official when its Windows 10 Creators update becomes available later this year. Moreover, it will likely be some time before we see similar support from other platforms. \n\"As these have not been documented within the Unicode Standard, it's unlikely they will see support from other vendors at this stage.\" Burge writes. \nStill, the update should be an encouraging sign for advocates of more diverse emoji. In the meantime, there are third-party apps for iOS and Android that already allow you to share more diverse emoji couples. \nBONUS: Signs you're reading too much into instant messages with emoji", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:46:32.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
