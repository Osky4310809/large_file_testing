You can't play at Ajax without being noticed,\" Klopp told Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet . \"Kasper Dolberg has a very great future. He is a fantastic player. \n\"I love Danish players. I had Leon Andreasen at Mainz, he was a monster. I also have fond memories of Bo Svensson. And Mohamed Zidan -- he is probably half Danish, because his wife is Danish. But it's not that they are Danes, it is all about their qualities.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:14:13.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
