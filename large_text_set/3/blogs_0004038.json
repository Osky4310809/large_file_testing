Casillas remains Europe's most imposing goalkeeper Getty Images 0 05-Mar-2017 03:52:17 The evergreen shot-stopper boasts the best record of anyone in Europe's top five leagues, and racked up another clean sheet on Saturday \nThe numbers do not lie: even at the grand old age of 35, Iker Casillas is still staking a big claim to be considered among Europe's finest goalkeepers. \nAnd with Keylor Navas under pressure in the Bernabeu net, did Real Madrid possibly rush into discarding one of their most legendary figures? \nMessi magic downs Celta \nCasillas' Porto team cruised to a 7-0 thrashing of Nacional on Saturday, putting the Portuguese giants ahead of Benfica at the top of the Primeira Liga. \nThat clean sheet was his 15th in 24 league games so far this season, and means he continues with the record of conceding just 11 times over the course of 2016-17. \nNo other goalkeeper can match Casillas' formidable keeping record in Europe, which is the finest in the continent's top five leagues. \nBayern Munich's Manuel Neuer comes closest with 13 goals conceded in 23 games, while the top five is rounded out by Sergio Asenjo of Villarreal, fellow legend Gianluigi Buffon at Juventus and Barcelona's Marc Andre ter Stegen. \nCasillas is also comfortably out-performing Navas, his replacement at the Bernabeu after he was released at the end of the 2014-15 season. \nThe Costa Rican has conceded 20 in his 18 appearances for Madrid in La Liga this term, keeping a paltry four clean sheets - less than a third of the number managed by his predecessor.
