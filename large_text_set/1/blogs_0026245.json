In the comic book realm, they’re already teaming up with the Justice League and starring in their own comics, in addition to the live-action reboot movie that’s hitting theaters in a few weeks. But as the franchise moves forward, it’s time look back…way back at the beginning. While the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ruled the ’90s in the US, that series was created from the Japanese series known as Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger . And now, the audio and music from the latest Power Rangers trailer has been smashed together with footage from the original Zyuranger series! \nMatt Carron created the Power Rangers/Zyuranger mashup, and it may prove to be a little disorienting to anyone who was more familiar with the “teenagers with attitude” from the American series. For starters, the yellow ranger is a guy on Zyuranger, and the entire team was part of a human race that evolved from dinosaurs millions of years ago. It’s also bizarrely hilarious to hear the semi-serious voice of Bryan Cranston ‘s Zordon speak to a group of characters who seem even more ridiculous than their American counterparts. \nThis video even has footage from clips that have rarely been seen in this country, including the shots of Bandora the Witch (whom we know as Rita Repulsa) riding her magical bicycle in the sky. Because of course she would. She may be an evil crone, but she’s not going to contribute to pollution! \nWhat did you think about the Power Rangers and Zyuranger mashup?
