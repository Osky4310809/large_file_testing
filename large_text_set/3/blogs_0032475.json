Henderson ruled out of Everton clash \nLiverpool will head into the Merseyside derby without captain Jordan Henderson as the England midfielder has failed to recover from his foot injury, report the Liverpool Echo. Jordan Henderson will miss Liverpool's game against Everton (Photo: Liverpool FC) \nThe Reds midfielder missed training once again at Melwood on Thursday due to the foot injury which has kept him out for the past five weeks. \nManager Jurgen Klopp had hoped that Henderson would be ready to return to action this weekend but he’s continuing to have treatment and won’t be risked against Everton. \nHenderson has sat out Liverpool’s past four matches since he was hurt in a challenge with a team-mate at Melwood on February 24. Sturridge back in training ahead of derby \nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp got a huge boost ahead of the Merseyside derby on Saturday as Daniel Sturridge returned to training, writes Kristian Walsh. \nThe England striker has had a wretched time with injuries and has not featured for Klopp's team since a 2-0 defeat at Hull in early February. Daniel Sturridge is back in training for the Reds (Photo: John Powell) \nHe last started a game nine weeks ago, for a League Cup exit at the hands of Southampton but was finally out on the training pitch again on Thursday afternoon. \nSturridge was initially sent home from the team's mid-season break in La Manga with a virus, before contracting a more serious complaint back on Merseyside. \nBut after returning from a month-long hiatus to make a telling impact in the Goodison derby in December, hopes have been raised he could do similar again after his appearance at Melwood.
