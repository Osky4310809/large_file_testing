Court not to rule \nIn a related development on Thursday, Romania's constitutional court said it would not rule on the decree. \nThe decree was referred to the court by Victor Ciorbea, the n ational ombudsman, on February 3, two days before the Social Democrats withdrew it. \n\"This decree does not exist anymore. It was scrapped [by the government],\" said Valer Dorneanu, the court president. \n\"We start from the truth that the emergency decree no longer exists.\" \nThe withdrawal must still be approved by parliament. \nAsked what would happen if parliament does not do so, Dorneanu said: \"We don't judge based on suppositions.\" Romania president's hometown divided over crisis Source: News agencies Tell us what you think Content on this website is for general information purposes only.
