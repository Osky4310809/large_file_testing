Mimiko, on Thursday, however, declared that his two terms in charge of the state as its governor was unprecedented in all ramifications. In his farewell message to the people of the state, Mimiko said his administration had repositioned the state for good. He said, “Today, eight years on, by the special grace of the Almighty God, Ondo State has not only done well, it has indeed become a benchmark across the globe in several of our well-conceived and well-delivered programmes. “It is now time to go and turn over the baton of the state to another governor. As I take my exit, I recall, in modesty, some of the programmes that have, these past eight years, set our state apart. Our life-enriching programmes, with the acronym ‘A Caring Heart,’ was activated to propel masses-centred approach to governance. “We developed frameworks for setting key result areas for each ministry, department and agency. Performance objectives and standard were defined while the activities of the MDAs were constantly measured to ensure that they conform to the vision, mission and objectives of government.” He expressed his gratitude to the people of the state for their support throughout his eight years in office. The outgoing governor urged the people of the state to extend the support given to him to his successor, Akeredolu, so that the incoming government would be successful. “It is imperative we support the incoming government so as to keep our state firmly on the path of peace and progress on which it has been for the past eight years,” Mimiko stated. Meanwhile, the Ondo State Police Command said it had mobilised no fewer than 5,000 officers and men to provide security at the inauguration of Akeredolu. The ceremony will hold at the Akure Township Stadium in Akure, the state capital. The Police Public Relations Officer of the command, Mr. Femi Joseph, who spoke with The PUNCH, said the command had planned for a successful inauguration. He added that the command would collaborate with other sister agencies in the state to provide adequate security at the venue of the event and Akure in general. The PPRO added, “About 5,000 officers and men will be deployed in Akure to prevent a breakdown of law and order. The number comprises both regular and mobile officers and men. We also have men from the Force Headquarters, Abuja, all of them are on the ground.” Also, the candidate of the Alliance for Democracy in the last state governorship election, Chief Olusola Oke, has congratulated Akeredolu and Mr. Agboola Ajayi on their inauguration as the governor and deputy governor of the state respectively. Oke, in a statement on Thursday by his media aide, Mr. Rotimi Ogunleye, said, he was ready to offer advice to the governor for the progress and development of the state. Copyright PUNCH.
