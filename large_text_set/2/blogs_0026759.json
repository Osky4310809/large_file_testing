The Daily Beast watched it so you don’t have to: \nThe episode finds Dunham’s Hannah Horvath going to the palatial apartment of famous author Chuck Palmer, played by Rhys. Hannah had written a piece for a Jezebel-esque feminist website surfacing stories from several college women claiming that Palmer used his power and influence to sleep with them on his book tour. When Hannah wonders whether all those encounters were consensual… They spend the episode discussing the nuances of consent and privilege. He thinks the women were seducing him so that they would have “a story” to tell. She thinks they were too intimidated by his celebrity to say no. He vents about the state of the world, in which his life can be destroyed by girls posting about sex with him on “something called Tumblr, without an e.” \nThe episode got really controversial when Palmer (Matthew Rhys) took out his penis during their “cuddle session” and made Hannah very uncomfortable. (It was fake, the director helpfully informed us.) So, if the idea behind this episode is TRUE — that powerful novelists can use their power to seduce young women — how much more true is it that PRESIDENTS can do the same thing? \nMJ Randolph writes : \nWhen Lena was going around campaigning for Hillary Clinton, she was also campaigning for Bill Clinton to be put right back in the White House. As you might remember, over a dozen women have accused the former President of sexual misconduct ranging from groping to rape (and don’t forget he actually settled a sexually harassment with Paula Jones.) To make matters worse, these women also claim that Hillary strategically “slut-shamed” them out of the cultural conversation. \nThe premise of this provocative episode of Girls — that sex, power, and rape are ripe for conversation and cultural improvement – is a good one. If only Lena Dunham would have the guts to speak out against the real sexual predators and their enablers instead of trying to usher them into the White House. \nWhy the double standard, Lena? If you REALLY cared about women, you’d care about all women — even the ones Hillary’s people called “trailer trash.” If you REALLY hated sexual predators, you’d fight against all of them – even the ones we’ve called Mister President.
