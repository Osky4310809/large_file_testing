About a month later in late January, Kylie took to Snapchat to hint at where her next pop-up shop would open next. Some fans guessed London, others guessed Paris and some people actually guessed RIGHT by saying New York City. A couple of weeks later, Kylie is finally ready to share a sneak peek of her upcoming NYC pop-up. Here’s the first photo. \n— Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) February 7, 2017 Fans are losing it.
