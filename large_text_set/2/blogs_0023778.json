I’ve never felt that uneasy, until this year,” said and emotional Mayor Kenney. \nMayor Kenney says Americans made it through that era. \n“I know we can do it again, because there’s no choice, other than doing it again,” he said. \nCity Solicitor Sozi Pedro Tulante says they are banding together to “give voice to the immigrant community and refugees.” \n“One of the reasons that my family came to America is because we were drawn by the possibility of hope, that you could make something of yourself in this country. I still think that’s possible, even in this day and age,” he said. \nTulante was born in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo), and when his family fled, he arrived in the US as an 8-year-old in 1983. His father was a political refugee, fearing that he would be killed if he stayed. \nOrganizers say one of the best defenses against deportation is citizenship through the naturalization process.
