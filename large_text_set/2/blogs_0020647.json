That’s why Facebook’s latest feature feels a bit confusing. \nFacebook has now added over 200 flags to its Profile Frames feature , which lets you overlay imagery filters atop your profile photo. Facebook first launched profile frames for sports teams in 2015, and started letting people submit their own frames last year. \nBut today’s push of flags, many for individual countries, seems to simultaneously align with Zuckerberg’s idea of finding your community on Facebook, yet contradicts the view of the world as a unified global community. If users are proudly waving their country’s flag all over Facebook, it might make them appear even more foreign to users from elsewhere. \nIt’s this “us vs them” ideology that Zuckerberg rails against in his 5000-word manifesto , but that is somewhat propelled by these profile flags. \nWhile this might be a minor launch meant to just be fun and patriotic, it outlines the potential concerns with Facebook’s leader taking an outright stand on world issues. Rather than simply maximizing for user engagement, shareholder value, and its basic mission to connect people, it must also weigh whether product changes align with its new mission of safe, inclusive, informed global community. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:33:26.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
