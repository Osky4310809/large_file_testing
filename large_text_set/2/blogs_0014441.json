Derick E. Hingle Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports Buddy Hield, New Orleans Pelicans “I’d say KD. He’s versatile, and he’s longer. He’s tough to defend.” Jonathan Bachman Getty Images Dominique Wilkins, Hall of Fame “For me, I would say Durant. He’s 6’11”, he can handle it, he can shoot it, and he’s got quickness. That’s an added advantage. He’s a difficult guy to guard.” Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls “All four. You’re not going to get me set up, to where I get switched onto one of them and they try to give me 50. I’m good.” Caylor Arnold USA TODAY Sports Nick Young, Los Angeles Lakers “I don’t think Klay gets the credit that he should. He comes off so many screens, non-stop running. But I think they’re all the best at their position. I’ve had to guard all of them, really. I’d say Steph last year, Durant this year, Klay two years ago. “ Brandon Ingram, Los Angeles Lakers “I haven’t had the chance to guard the guards, but I know Kevin Durant is a hard one to defend. Steph is so hard to defend, he can get his shot up anytime he wants. Klay is hard — I don’t know. It’s a tough one, but Kevin Durant. He’s a scorer, so I’d probably have to give it to him.” Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets “KD. Just because he’s tall, and he makes every shot look like an easy shot.” NBAE NBAE/Getty Images Shaquille O'Neal, Hall of Fame \"I gotta go with Steph. So tricky with the ball. Klay’s a catch-and-shoot. He’s also difficult because he comes off a million screens. Draymond, because you’ve got to leave to help all the other guys, he’s always open. KD is KD. But probably Steph.\" Steve Mitchell Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports C.J. McCollum, Portland Trail Blazers “Probably KD, I mean he’s seven-foot with handles and the ability to shoot, so I’d probably say he’s the toughest guy. They’re all very good, though.” AP Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors “All of us. We’re all different, unique. As a team we put pressure on the defense. We all do it together.“", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T20:34:07.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
