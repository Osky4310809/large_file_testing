Mar 14, 2017 8:15 PM 0 \nAuthored by Nick Giambruno via InternationalMan.com, \nTomorrow, a vote in the Netherlands could push the euro and the EU one step closer to death … \nFor the last several months, I’ve been warning readers about a populist tsunami washing through Europe. It’s drastically changing the Continent’s political landscape in a way not seen since before World War 2. \nThis wave is flushing away traditional “mainstream” parties. And it’s bringing in anti-establishment populists who want to leave the euro currency and the European Union. \nIt’s already hit the UK in the form of Brexit, killing David Cameron’s pro-EU government in the process. \nThen it struck Italy, washing away pro-EU Matteo Renzi’s government. \nTomorrow, on March 15, the populist wave is set to hit the Netherlands. \nThat’s when Dutch voters go to the polls. I think the anti-EU populist Party for Freedom will win. It’s led by Geert Wilders, who was close to Trump’s campaign. Some even call him the “Dutch Trump.” \nLeaving the euro is a top priority for the Party for Freedom. If it wins, it would be another nail in the coffin for the European currency. \nEither way, the Dutch parliament will discuss how to leave the Eurozone shortly after the March 15 election. \nA top lawmaker recently said that “the probe will examine whether it would be possible for the Dutch to withdraw from the single currency, and if so how,” Reuters reported. \nThe euro’s problems are compounding and could get much worse, very soon. \nSome of Europe’s biggest countries have elections this year: \nFrance (April 23) \nGermany (September 24) \nThese elections will ultimately determine the fate of the European Union. \nThe Brexit vote, Donald Trump’s election, and the failure of Italy’s constitutional referendum have already boosted anti-euro populist parties in these countries. If the Party for Freedom wins in the Netherlands tomorrow, they’ll get another leg up. \nPopulist parties have a real chance to win in both France and Germany. But even if they win in just one, the EU would likely unravel. \nThe biggest issue in these elections is the migrant crisis, which we’ve covered here extensively. And the crisis is only accelerating. \nEvery single migrant that arrives in Europe increases the chance that anti-EU populists will win a key election. That’s not good news for the EU or the euro. It’s also not good news for the US. \nWhatever happens in the EU—the world’s largest economy and a major US trading partner—matters. If the euro collapses, expect it to trigger a stock market collapse in the US. \nThe Financial Times recently put it this way: It would probably lead to the most violent economic shock in history, dwarfing the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008 and the 1929 Wall Street crash. \nIf the FT is even partially right, it means we’re looking at a possible stock market crash of historic proportions. It could devastate anyone with a brokerage account. But it could also create enormous opportunities to profit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T02:22:44.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
