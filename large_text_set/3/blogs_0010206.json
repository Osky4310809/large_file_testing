Aesthetically similar to a baseball home plate, the landmine has a small metal tube that you can place the end of a barbell into. Once inside, the device allows you to move the barbell in any direction you choose. But why opt for a landmine over other pieces of gym equipment? Not only is there a low risk for injury, but it also takes traditional movements, like presses, to a whole other level. \"The landmine is a fantastic piece of equipment for many reasons, but a big one for me is its ability to make traditional linear movements more three-dimensional. Its design helps you create unique angles and movement patterns with an added element of rotation,\" says Matt Delaney, Equinox Tier X Coach . Although landmines can be loaded with plates to make movements heavier, Delaney suggests getting used to the equipment without those extras first. Once you're ready to take things to the next level, load lightly. \"It's much better to start low and continue to add as necessary than set the bar too high initially and end up injured,\" he says. How it works: Do workout once through, two to three times weekly.
