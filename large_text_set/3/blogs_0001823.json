With this week’s Wolverine movie Logan showing us a near-future that feels more like a right-now, with cybernetically-enhanced bad guys chasing illegal mutant immigrants across the border, it seemed like as good a time as any to look back at some of the other bleak futures from our recent past. Check out our list of The 12 Best Dystopian Movies in the gallery below! \nYou can read our two Logan reviews HERE and HERE ! \nSet in the near future, the film follows a weary Logan (Hugh Jackman) as he cares for an ailing Professor X ( Sir Patrick Stewart ) in a hideout on the Mexican border. But Logan’s attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces. \nRELATED: The Evolution of Hugh Jackman’s Logan \nAlso starring Dafne Keen, Eriq La Salle, Stephen Merchant , Elise Neal and Elizabeth Rodriguez, Logan is coming to theaters on March 3, 2017. Directed by James Mangold ( Walk the Line , The Wolverine ) and scripted by David James Kelly, the new film will mark the ninth (and said to be final) time that Jackman has played the Marvel Comics character on the big screen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:52:55.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
