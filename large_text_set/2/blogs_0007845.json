Governor Rauner and President Trump regularly attack Chicago because they hope to score political points. It is shameful.” \nThere is no way to sugar-coat the rest of this news. If we are not able to win the political battles in Springfield, we will have to make more cuts. Those cuts will be even more painful. We need not just the $215 million first step that the Governor has stolen from your children. We need real change that is fair to your children. \n“But while the Governor and his friends fight about how to solve the problem,” they continue,” they know that every day they cheat your children of their fair share, they can score political points with their own supporters. Just like President Trump.” \nAnd like President Trump, Governor Rauner is targeting our most vulnerable citizens: immigrant children, racial minorities, the poor. \n“Please join with us in demanding that the Governor and his friends stop acting like President Trump. Please join us in demanding that your children receive their fair share of money Illinois spends, ” the letter concludes. “Please join us in demanding that your children receive the quality education they deserve.” \nWGN says one parent contacted them in anger over the letter, writing of CPS CEO Forrest Claypool, “This is so inappropriate. How can he send political propaganda home?” \nSarah Brune of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform heavily criticized the action. \nInvoking partisan politics – especially at the national level – is not the most effective way to build trust with parents and students. \nEducation is becoming more and more a fiery issue with the new administration as Democrats roundly criticized his nomination for the secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, and ultimately forced Vice President to break the vote tie and have her confirmed. Chicago has also been the target of much of Trump’s rhetoric from his tweets to his speeches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:07:00.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
