Korea 2017/03/13 15:58 Print \nSEOUL, March 13 (Yonhap) -- U.S. special operations forces, including the unit that killed Osama Bin Laden, will take part in joint military drills in South Korea to practice incapacitating North Korean leadership in the case of conflict, a military official said Monday. \nThe U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six will join the annual Foal Eagle and Key Resolve exercises between the two allies for the first time, along with the Army's Rangers, Delta Force and Green Berets. \n\"A bigger number of and more diverse U.S. special operation forces will take part in this year's Foal Eagle and Key Resolve exercises to practice missions to infiltrate into the North, remove the North's war command and demolition of its key military facilities,\" the official told Yonhap News Agency asking not to be named. \nThe Foal Eagle exercise started March 1 and will run through the end of April. On Monday, the Key Resolve computer-simulated command post exercise began and will run through March 24. \nSeoul and Washington said the joint drills are purely defensive, but Pyongyang has denounced them as rehearsal for an invasion. \n(END)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:22:53.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
