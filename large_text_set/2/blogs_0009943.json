Twitter Courtesy of Instagram/ @kyliejenner \nKylie Jenner 's second pop-up shop opened in New York today (Monday, February 13) and, predictably, the turnout was insane. The store was fully stocked with Kylie Cosmetics products — including rows and rows of some 5,500 rainbow Lip Kits, and the Valentine's Day, Holiday, and Birthday collections — along with Kylie merch, and somewhat inexplicably, a bed. Though the bed was not for sale, we wouldn't put it past Kylie fans to leave the store with everything but the kitchen sink. \nKylie's first pop-up shop opened at the Topanga Westfield Mall in California in December and drew a crowd of thousands. Although fans lined up at 4:30am and the line moved very slowly, most got in to scoop up the goods and take a picture with Kylie, Kris Jenner, or Tyga, who all showed up to celebrate the event. Things in New York were a little more...intense. The East Coast store has just as much merch, but everything from the date, to the location, to the crowd that showed up to shop the goods, was different. \nFor starters, the fact that the New York pop-up store opened to the public on a Monday morning sent Kylie fans into a tailspin about whether or not to skip school or work (and possibly buy plane tickets) to stand around in the freezing cold. \nThe line, which started forming on Saturday, eventually wrapped around several city blocks. By the time Kylie's team was set to open doors at 10am EST, Mercer Street was totally swarming, complete with cops. \nAdmittedly, the lucky shoppers who made it into the store were greeted to moody lighting, bumping music, and, by all accounts, a relatively chill scene. There was no pushing or shoving from what we could see on social media. \nNaturally though, the store was completely wiped of product within a couple of hours, frustrating fans who waited in the cold for hours and opening the door for complaints. Good thing there's always eBay, right?
