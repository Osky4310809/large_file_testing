The film reportedly reveals new video footage taken from a market in Ferguson Michael Brown was accused of robbing, CNN reported. Director Jason Pollock claims Brown did not rob the store as widely reported, but was simply picking up some cigarillos the clerks had given him in exchange for marijuana.   \nThey then accused the city of a cover-up. \nThe film’s producers accuse the City of Ferguson of hiding this video and only releasing the later video with claims Brown was robbing the store. \n“Maybe the City of Ferguson wouldn’t have gotten tore up like that,” Michael Brown Sr. said during a press conference about the video. “It’s almost like they asked for it, if you ask me, for not keeping no truth in there.” \nExcept it wasn’t the city that was lying, but the filmmaker. The filmmaker had edited the video to make it appear as though there had been a transaction, when the full video made it clear there had been no such thing.   \nOn Monday, the city released the full unedited video , which shows the clerks putting everything back on the shelves, showing that they were not holding anything for him and there was no ‘drug deal’ as the filmmaker claimed. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nMoreover the video was not covered up, it had been mentioned and included in police reports but had been considered irrelevant because it didn’t really show anything related to the later incident.  3'); }); \nBrown should be called out for his horrible comments. \nBut the filmmaker who put all these lies out in order to sell his film should bear some responsibility for promoting lies, information he had to have know were lies if he had the unedited video.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:01:15.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
