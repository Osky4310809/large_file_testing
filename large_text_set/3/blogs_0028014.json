He just put UNC in the Final Four.\nWelcome to the Heroes of March Club, Luke Maye. The mostly anonymous North Carolina forward hit the game-winner against Kentucky with 0.3 seconds left to put the Tar Heels into the Final Four. \nMaye played the biggest game of his life when UNC needed it most: he went for 17 points on 6-of-9 shooting and just hit one of the biggest shots in program history. \nThis game only became dramatic in the final moments because of two huge three-pointers by Malik Monk in the final seconds. You can see the second one above: an absolutely absurd shot to tie the game. Monk went more than 15 minutes without scoring in the second half, but it’s hard to blame him after two clutch triples.\nNorth Carolina now faces Oregon in the Final Four. Maye’s career night carried them there. We’ll see you in Phoenix, Tar Heels. That was a hell of an Elite Eight game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:47:11.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
