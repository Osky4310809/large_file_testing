(Photo: Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.) \nDoes Corinne Olympios make your blood boil so much you could cook her nanny's famous cheese pasta? Too bad. She is making no apologies about her behavior on The Bachelor this season. \nWhile chatting with Ellen DeGeneres on an episode of her talk show airing Wednesday, the woman vying for Nick Viall's heart and roses said she doesn't have any regrets about the dating show, which she confirmed portrays her in an authentic light. \n\"That is the real me,\" the 24-year-old business owner said. \"It is definitely a real side of me, but there are many other sides to me.\" \n\"What sides didn't we see?\" DeGeneres asked her guest. \"We saw the front side.\" \n\"I'm an older sister. I run a business,\" Corinne said. \"I'm an athlete -- well, I work out every day. I have a trainer. I just think that you'll see a lot more of Corinne as the season goes on.\" \nWhen asked if she could see why the other contestants might think she's crazy, Corinne offered little in the way of understanding. \n\"I think I'm funny,\" she said, reviewing her time in front of the camera. \"I actually really laugh very hard at myself. I'm like, 'Wow, I didn't even know I was that funny.'\" Corinne did admit, however, that she appeared \"a little bit more promiscuous than I thought I would look.\" \nShe also did her best to clear the air of mystery around her nanny, Raquel, explaining she uses the word \"nanny\" because she finds it to be \"more respectful\" than calling her a \"cleaning lady or housekeeper.\" \n\"She's kind of like my everything,\" Corinne shared with DeGeneres. \"She raised my sister. She helped my mom through cancer. She's just great. She's part of our family. She's not like my nanny like my babysitter.\" \nGot it, Corinne.
