Wrong. \nAhead of next month's Red Nose Day , Dele Alli paired up with GAMERAISERS to undertake a few a light-hearted challenges raising awareness for youth homelessness. \nOne such challenge, was to get Spurs teammate Eric Dier on the phone and sing his chant to him. \"Hang on, what?\" (Photo: Twitch) \nSure enough, January's Premier League Player of the Month gets his best pal on the phone and sings the \"I love Eric Dier\" chant. \nAlli then requests that Dier reciprocates the challenge. \"HAHA\" (Photo: Twitch) \nAfter having the cheek to criticise Alli on his timing and tempo, Dier starts singing, \"Dele Alli, Alli\" - which is completely wrong. \nWe don't even know what the 23-year-old was trying to sing here, although it does sound like the start of the \"Steve Gerrard, Gerrard\" song. \nAlli is left utterly bemused as he and his radio friends all burst out laughing. \nEventually, Dier gets it right. But could his mistake spell trouble in paradise for the pair?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:51:33.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
