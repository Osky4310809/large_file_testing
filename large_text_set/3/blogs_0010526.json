Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe Nightly Show has been continually blasted by viewers since it started on ITV two weeks ago. \nThe talk show's format involves a celebrity taking over as host every weeknight for a whole week. \nDavid Walliams hosted the first week to a very poor reception, and then John Bishop didn't do a much better job the week after. \nHowever, queen of TV Davina McCall took the reins in tonight's show, and viewers absolutely LOVED her, with some claiming she's \"saved The Nightly Show\". \nOne said: \"At last a presenter who knows how it's done @ThisisDavina #onlytooktwoweeks #thenightlyshow.\" \nAnother agreed: \"Has @ThisisDavina actually won #thenightlyshow ? Like a different show.\" \nA third rejoiced: \"@thisisdavina has saved #thenightlyshow.\" \nDavina was chatting to Boy George and The Replacement actress Vicky McClure on the episode. \nAnd she even got the actress to rap Missy Elliot after performing a rap herself. \nSome viewers were even complaining the show was now too SHORT, with one saying: \"@ThisisDavina finally going to start watching #thenightlyshow loving this but need a bit longer for the chat 30 mins not enough for it all.\" \nBefore Davina's successful turn on the show, even the stars of Gogglebox blasted The Nightly Show - after having to watch it for our entertainment.

Like going to sleep. \n\"See, I'm quite switched off now,\" admitted Ellie, honestly. \"I feel like this would be the point I'd have it on in bed and pick up my phone and look on Facebook.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:24:05.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
