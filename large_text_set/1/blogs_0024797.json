At four over for the tournament, Woods finished four shots back of the projected cut line at Torrey Pines. According to ESPN.com's Bob Harig , Friday marked just the 16th time in Woods' career he missed the cut at a PGA Tour event. And even though he's heading home after just two days in Southern California, Woods flashed marked improvement Friday after he carded five bogeys and one double bogey in his opening round at Torrey Pines' South Course. By comparison, Woods notched a pair of bogeys and a pair of birdies on an otherwise tame day that included several silver linings, according to GolfChannel.com's Tiger Tracker: GC Tiger Tracker @GCTigerTracker Tiger hit a lot of good shots today, chipping was strong, better with the driver, more to feel good about today. 1/27/2017, 10:29:03 PM After his round, Woods acknowledged that while he \"didn't make enough birdies\" to extend his stay through the weekend, he did hit the ball \"well enough,\" per Tiger Tracker . The 14-time major champion can also take solace in the fact his playing partners, Jason Day and Dustin Johnson —arguably the two hottest players in the world —couldn't finish inside the cut line, as Golf Chanel noted on Twitter: Golf Channel @GolfChannel", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T03:18:40.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
