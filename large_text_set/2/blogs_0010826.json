But, unpredictable is one thing that the chat show has been not. Now, in what looks like a desperate attempt to disassociate from the \"same old, same old\", the makers (read Karan Johar) have brought to us a rather confusing group of people for the finale. Ayan Mukherji, Malaika Arora, Neha Dhupia, and Rohan Joshi will come together to judge a segment that is being hailed as the Koffee awards. \nOwing to the rare candour that our favourite actors have exhibited during the course of this season (cue in the sarcasm), this makes-zero-sense league of filmy people will put their viewing expertise to use to declare winners in various make-believe categories. From what we're guessing, this show will likely turn into an occurrence that is common only in the KJO universe - biased, barely funny and painfully scripted. Our only respite is funny man Rohan Joshi because, let's be honest, his AIB-approved humour is the only saving grace here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:46:22.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
