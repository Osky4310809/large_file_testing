Because Graham, in case you missed it, is a human being.\n“I workout. I do my best to eat well. I love the skin I’m in. And I’m not ashamed of a few lumps, bumps or cellulite.. and you shouldn’t be either. #beautybeyondsize #lovetheskinyourein,” she captioned the pic.\nI workout. I do my best to eat well. I love the skin I'm in. And I'm not ashamed of a few lumps, bumps or cellulite.. and you shouldn't be either. #beautybeyondsize #lovetheskinyourein \nA photo posted by A S H L E Y G R A H A M (@theashleygraham) on Jan 25, 2017 at 6:41pm PST \nThis is all par for the course for Graham, who has risen to fame as a body-positive model, and only grown more famous over the past year thanks to her boundary-breaking Sports Illustrated cover (and now, of course, the coveted Top Model gig alongside new host Rita Ora).\nThe 29-year-old has appeared in everything from a DNCE video as Joe Jonas’ love interest to MTV’s Made as a modeling coach, all the while preaching a message of self-love, health, and inclusivity.\n“I love to sweat it out at the gym — two years ago, I even made workout videos — but I also don’t restrict myself from eating certain foods or indulging on some extra-cheese mac ‘n’ cheese every once in a while,” she wrote in Lenny Letter last summer , after photos of a seemingly slimmed-down Graham led to minor media backlash.\n“I’m very proud of my work as a model, and I’m even more proud of the work we’ve all done to raise awareness for body positivity and size diversity within the fashion industry … However, I refuse to let others dictate how I live my life and what my body should look like for their own comfort. And neither should you.”\nKudos to Graham for continuing to love the skin she’s in. And for reminding us all that we can — and should — do the same.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T17:49:00.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
