In the book, he shares his personal account of growing up in East Atlanta and making the transition from drug dealer to full-time rapper who pioneered the trap music genre. \n“Yet every success was followed by setback,” the description says. “Too often, his erratic behavior threatened to end it all. Incarceration, violence, rap beefs, drug addiction. But Gucci Mane has changed, and he’s decided to tell his story.” \nGucci Mane had previously announced that his autobiography would be called Diary of a Trap God and was among the projects he was working on in prison as well as a movie called The Spot . \nUpon his release from prison last year, Guwop has chosen a sober lifestyle and got engaged to his longtime girlfriend, Keyshia Ka’oir . He also continued his unprecedented streak of releasing music, including three albums that gave him HipHopDX’s 2016 We Working Award .
