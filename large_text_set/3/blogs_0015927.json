(Spoiler: if you’re poor or old, sucks to be you.)

Many jobs there are in agriculture, and people have a harder time getting by in the off-season. The average family there will get $7,815 less in assistance buying insurance. Anchorage, Alaska , which has some of the most expensive health insurance in the country . Many insurers have left the Alaska market entirely because it’s so hard to make money in the business: cost of living is high, and providers are few and far between. Syracuse, New York , which has been hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs for decades. Reading, PA , a majority Latino city in the middle of a mostly white, rural-ish county. It has high poverty rates and in 2011 was named the poorest city in America . Chattanooga, TN , a city whose economy is doing pretty well overall—but also has a serious problem with income inequality . Its sunny averages hide a large number of people deep in poverty.

San Francisco, New York City, and Washington, DC have the highest income in the nation, and all three would see their average resident get a higher , rather than a lower, subsidy on their insurance.
