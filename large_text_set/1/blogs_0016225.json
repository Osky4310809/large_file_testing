The veteran midfielder is said to have rebuffed £430,000 per week to stay at the Etihad Stadium. \nToure has actually knocked back interest from China for a second time, according to BBC Sport's Simon Stone : \"Toure, 33, was the subject of interest from the Chinese Super League last summer. He decided against moving then and gave the same response when he was contacted again to say the offer remained open during the current transfer window, which closes on 31 January.\" \nSignificantly, Toure's show of loyalty may not improve his standing at City, specifically with manager Pep Guardiola, per Stone: \"Toure has been free to sign pre-contract agreements with clubs overseas since 1 January but it is understood he still enjoys the English game. Guardiola has not given Toure any guarantees about his future beyond the summer.\" \nIt's a notable decision from Toure considering things have been tense with Guardiola since the summer. The player's agent, Dimitri Seluk, clashed with the City boss, while Toure was left out of the club's UEFA Champions League squad for the group stage. \nHowever, Seluk is now happy to play up his client's sense of loyalty to City, per Sky Sports News HQ: Agent: Yaya wants to play at the highest level. He's happy at Manchester City and likes football more than money: https://t.co/l0muFEO6I0 — Sky Sports News HQ (@SkySportsNewsHQ) January 17, 2017 \nGuardiola has wisely reinstalled Toure to the City starting XI in recent weeks. The Ivory Coast man has repaid the gesture by proving he hasn't lost his eye for goal or his quality in possession. \nToure has found the net four times in Premier League and FA Cup action, according to WhoScored.com . City still need Toure's ability to turn matches in their favour. \nGuardiola's midfield has lacked ingenuity with playmaker Ilkay Gundogan on the injury list. Meanwhile, there hasn't been a secure base while holding player Fernandinho has served two suspensions. \nAdmittedly, it's still not always easy for Guardiola to find Toure's best role. The Spaniard recently miscast Toure as a defensive midfielder during Sunday's 4-0 defeat to Everton . Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images Toure has been a useful contributor since returning to the first team. \nTruthfully, Toure still belongs further forward, where he can influence City's inconsistent attacking play. His decision to shun the riches on offer in China is still a boost for Guardiola, whose side have slipped to fifth after losing at Everton. Alexis Sanchez on Guardiola's Transfer List \nArsenal forward Alexis Sanchez is reportedly one of four major transfer targets Guardiola wants to sign to bolster his ailing squad. The Daily Star 's Luke Gardener has named Sanchez, along with Southampton centre-back Virgil van Dijk, Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke and Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, as Guardiola's main targets. \nAs Gardener noted, Sanchez's current contract situation could play into City's hands: \" Guardiola's interest will unnerve Gunners fans who are desperate for the Chile international to sign a new deal at the club.\" Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Sanchez is said to be on City's radar. \nNegotiations between Arsenal and Sanchez are said to have stalled, according to Lee Astley of the Sun . However, the player recently revealed he's content with the Gunners, per an interview with Arsenal's official YouTube channel (h/t Callum Davis of the Daily Telegraph ): “I believe we have the players and the quality to win many things. I feel really happy and comfortable at the club. I want to give the fans a new title.\" \nYet Sanchez hasn't always seemed as happy as he sounds. Not when he reacted angrily to being substituted late on during Arsenal's recent 4-0 win over Swansea City . Is Sanchez the right fit for City?
