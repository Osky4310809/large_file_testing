The relationship ended, she found Keith Urban and everyone went on their merry way. But they weren’t just dating —they were actually engaged. What! Really? \nAdvertisement \n\nIn an interview with Net-a-Porter’s magazine The Edit , Kidman spoke highly of Kravitz and also of his daughter, Zoë , who appears in that fun little HBO show coming out on Sunday, Big Little Lies . “Well, I knew Zoë because I was engaged to her father,” she said, blithe and casual and cool. “It’s all in the family!”\nApparently Kidman has talked about being engaged between Tom-Tom and Keith “ Kissy Kissy Time ” Urban in the past —in a 2007 Vanity Fair interview , she said:\n\nAdvertisement \n\n“I didn’t really want a relationship. I just wanted my kids to have me, and I didn’t feel comfortable having some person in that small hubbub. And then I got engaged to somebody … but it just wasn’t right. I wasn’t ready. We weren’t ready.” I ask who this mystery fiancé was, but she declines to say. “I get engaged and I get married—that’s my thing,” she tells me. “I don’t want to date. I’m interested in a very, very deep connection.”\nIt was Lenny Kravitz, a man who supposedly wrote the song “Lady” about Nicole Kidman! Imagine if Lenny Kravitz and Nicole Kidman were married now. Imagine if she was with him instead of Keith Urban. Not too implausible to me. \n[ People ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:16:51.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
