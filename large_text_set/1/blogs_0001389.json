Its founder, Regina Merson, is a badass Mexican-American that is slaying the beauty industry without sacrificing who she really is. There’s nothing more I love than a good girlboss success story, and I was so proud to see that someone created an authentic brand in an industry where Latinas are constantly misrepresented. Discovering this brand kind of made me feel the same way the MAC x Selena collection did. They both gave me something I didn’t even know I needed.\nOnly one question remained: Are their products actually good? In short: HELL YES! My absolute favorite is their Bold Lip Color Stick . The Brava shade is now my go-to red. It goes on smoothly and it gives lips long-lasting wear and high-pigment color. I really love this lipstick even though I usually gravitate towards mattes, and this one has more of a satin finish. Cons: It transfers a bit, but nothing major. You won’t need to reapply every five minutes.\nYou can buy it here for $16.\nID: 10256905 3. Ginger + Liz Nail Lacquer View this image ›\nEssence Gant I rarely paint my nails, but when I do, I use Ginger + Liz. It’s a vegan-friendly and toxin-free nail lacquer brand started by two brilliant girlfriends. I love that it doesn’t have all the bad stuff in it often used in cosmetics, and the colors are still super rich and pigmented. After just one coat, the color shows up just as rich as it looks in the bottle. My horrible painting skills aside (stop judging), you can see just how pigmented the lacquer is. I’m wearing the color Chase Me, by the way. It also dries pretty fast, so you’re not walking around with fan hands for too long after you apply. Vegan-friendly, toxin-free, AND owned by two smart women? YES, PLEASE!\nShop all the colors here for $12 each.\nID: 10233443 4. Alma Aromatherapy Healing Clay Mask Daniela Cadena\nDaniela Cadena\nDaniela Cadena\n Alma is a skincare company founded by two sisters who turned their interest in sustainable agriculture, into a brand that only uses 100% organic ingredients and naturally soothing essential oils. A friend turned me on to them since she knows I LOVE a good face mask, and I am so glad she did! I tried their Healing Clay Mask with little to no expectations since I wasn’t really familiar with the brand, but I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised. It smells amazing and feels very gentle on the skin. When you rinse it off, you can literally feel the difference in your skin. My face felt smoother than a baby’s butt and look so much brighter.\nBuy it on their website for $22 .\nID: 10244832 5. Makeup For Melanin Girls View this image ›\nEssence Gant Makeup For Melanin Girls is a new cosmetics brand with bomb shades of liquid lipsticks. The packaging is a cute tube with metallic lettering, which makes you even more hype to pull it out. Like, look at me with my lipstick with fancy lettering, and it’s made especially for brown girls! The color is on-point and true-to-tube, and the wear is pretty good. I only had to do a slight touch-up after eating and drinking. It dries matte, but it doesn’t make your lips feel like cement. Makeup For Melanin Girls has a good color range, too. I’m wearing Dutty Wine , and they also have cool shades like this standout purple , this classic red , and this futuristic tin silver .\nCheck out all the shades here for $17 each.\nID: 10233736 6. Gaby Espino Lipsticks If you grew up in Latin America or have access to Telemundo, you probably know who Gaby Espino is. To most, she’s a successful novela actress who ventured into the beauty industry, but I grew up watching her teenage novelas after school, so to me, she’s goals all around. Putting my admiration for her aside, I tried her matte lipstick and her lipgloss to see what her products were all about. To my surprise, I LOVED the lipgloss (even though I’m not typically a gloss girl) and could do without the matte.\nThe gloss has impressive color and coverage, and it’s totally shiny and smooth. I tried the shade Golden Whisper , and it’s probably my favorite nude to date. It also smells fantastic. As for the matte color, it’s not buildable at all, so even if you reapply, it looks spotty. That being said, I did run into Nick Jonas the night I wore it for the first time. Lucky lipstick, perhaps?\nYou can get them both here for $24.99.\nID: 10256969 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!", "external_links": ["https://makeupformelaningirls.com/collections/all-products/products/dutty-wine", "http://www.almaaromatherapy.com/shop/clay-mask", "https://reinarebelde.com/lips/", "http://www.almaaromatherapy.com/", "https://www.instagram.com/gabyespino/?hl=en", "http://gabyespino.com/product/golden-whisper/", "https://makeupformelaningirls.com/collections/all-products/products/goals", "https://makeupformelaningirls.com/collections/all-products/products/power", "https://makeupformelaningirls.com/collections/all-products", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BOmFEaJFKe1/?taken-by=danichain", "https://makeupformelaningirls.com/collections/all-products/products/iconic", "http://www.gingerandliz.com/shop-collection-s/3.htm", "https://reinarebelde.com/lips/?pid=168#products_ul", "http://gabyespino.com/tienda/"], "published": "2017-01-04T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:36:05.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
