The right-hook Raptor is an optional conversion courtesy of a Sutton Bespoke programme, which costs 36,000 pound sterling (RM199,111) on top of the Raptor’s 78,000 pound sterling (RM431,401) on-the-road price in the UK. \nAs in the United States, the converted F-150 Raptor is powered by a 3.5 litre, EcoBoost turbocharged V6 petrol engine with 450 hp and 691 Nm of torque at its disposal, channeled to all four wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. The UK-market Raptor is available in two forms, a two-door SuperCab with rearward opening aft doors, while the SuperCrew model sports full-sized rear doors with more cabin space. \nThe right-hand-drive conversion uses precision-sculpted mouldings of interior components, which are then applied to the interior by craftsmen who will create a mirrored configuration of the vehicle’s dashboard appearance and steering assembly. \nAdditional options can be specified upon request, which include 10-way electrically-adjustable and heated seats, dual-zone climate control, all-around camera setup, twin-panel moonroof, as well as a trailer package with Ford Backup Assist for reversing with a trailer attached. \nServices rendered by Sutton Bespoke isn’t limited to the right-hand-drive conversion. The specialist operation can also offer a performance kit for the 3.5 EcoBoost V6 engine, bringing its outputs to over 590 bhp. As standard, the 2017 F-150 Raptor is fitted with FOX Racing dampers, and offers 13 inches of suspension travel at the front, with 13.9 inches of travel at the rear. \nGALLERY: 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor The all-new Ford F-150 Raptor (SuperCab model pictured) is powered by Ford’s new, second-generation high output 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine that produces more power with greater efficiency than the current 6.2-liter V8, which is rated at 411 horsepower and 434 lbs.-ft. of torque.
