The half-an-hour wait for David Haye should have been expected - his Miami lifestyle, after all, is hardly conducive to accurate time-keeping. But on Wednesday at the open workouts, there was worry. \nRumours of an injury had dominated the day, arriving via Haye's own social media account but spreading like wildfire throughout the afternoon. His Achilles, they claimed, was the source of panic just three days before he finally locks horns with Tony Bellew, live on Sky Sports Box Office. Book Sky Sports Box Office event here David Haye works out \nThe ring, in the shadows of The O2 where the real fighting will take place on Saturday, was filled throughout Wednesday evening but Haye's fitness could have rendered the whole thing redundant. Shortly before 9pm, the laid-back Haye finally sauntered in and wrapped his hands. \nInjured right shoulder?

A sign of what awaits us? Only they know. \nHaye did manage one smile - several minutes into his shadow-boxing he replied warmly to a cheer from the crowd. \"I'm a lean, mean, machine,\" he joked with Sky Sports' Johnny Nelson and his friend BJ Flores, a beaten foe of Bellew's. \nLess than 10 miles from his south London home, Haye finally appeared like he was enjoying himself upon his return to elite boxing for the first time in nearly five years. It was not the appearance of an injured manâ€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:12:00.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
