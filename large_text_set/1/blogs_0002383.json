For Fallout 4 he felt that game is a more personal story, this time making the piano take a more prominent role in the game's score. He combined a real piano with an electric piano to make a \"sound that is really round and not bright at all but very lush.\" \nIn addition, he crafted the soundscapes with unorthodox instruments focusing on three elements: \"classical instruments; electronic instruments; and a non-musical instrument or an ethnic/primitive instrument.\" Players could immediately tell what sort of area they were in based on the background instrumentation. [1] \nIt was also announced that the game would offer \"three times the amount of music (compared with Fallout 3)\" combining the instantly recognizable with the lesser-known tracks by well-known artists. \nThe third section focuses on obscure tracks from long-forgotten bands \"with ludicrous lyrics and a distinctive sound\". \n\" It's All Over But the Crying \" was the first song chosen with The Ink Spots as a hallmark of the series. While the recognizable opening guitar riff evokes a sense of nostalgia, the second half provides a lively, hopeful setting. \nMusic Supervision and licensing was done by Christopher S. Parker and Ian M. Anderson, music coordinator for Brandracket, LLC. \nWith Chris, director Todd Howard delved into the area of music history of artists who did songs about uranium and radioactivity with a naivet√© to the lyrics. \"Back when these songs came out, society was fueled by a utopian optimism that stood in stark contrast with the apocalyptic nature of world-destroying atomic weapons.\" \nMany of these songs originated from the soundtrack to the 1982 documentary The Atomic Cafe and later expanded by the Atomic Platters and CONELRAD Radio. [2] \nIn addition, a collaboration with singer Lynda Carter was announced to write and perform original songs for the game. Carter was inserted in the game as Magnolia a singer in Goodneighbor .
