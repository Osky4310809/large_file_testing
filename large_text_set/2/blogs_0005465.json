THIS CIRCULAR PIANO! \nThe piano, called a “Pianoarc” is made by a company of the same name. Shortly after it appeared during the halftime show the company’s site completely crashed. Nobody can learn anything about them.\nThankfully we have a cached version to tell us a little more. The Pianoarc features 294 keys and are custom built. There’s only the ability to request a quote — which means they cost a whole lot.\nEither way these look absolutely incredible and was one of the most memorable things about an already stellar halftime show.
