However, it isn’t the only framework that provides the ability to theme your device. Substratum is a popular alternative to CMTE, and the developers behind this project recently sat down with us to reminisce on their past, present, and future work.\nSpeaking of future work, XDA Recognized Developer nicholaschum is now ready to tease a new project him and his team have been working on called “ FloatUI “. The project can basically be described as a “ per-app theming solution ” and Mr. Chum is giving us a sneak peak of what to expect with FloatUI.\nMeet FloatUI: Your Per-App Theming Solution https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2017/02/1_5003822120304640001.mp4 \nAs you can see in the video above, once activated, there will be a small icon floating on the home screen at all times. Hence, whenever you launch an application, you can utilize FloatUI. Let’s consider an example here:\nLet’s assume you have the themes Mono/Art and Reverie installed on your device and FloatUI has been activated. Now, you head over to the settings and change the theme of the settings application to Mono/Art. The change will be made within a second. You now move towards the notification area and want it to look like the one Reverie offers. Use FloatUI and the notifications will be themed instantly, separately from the settings page.\n\nHence, you can set specific themes for specific apps . You can also toggle framework overlays. Moreover, the themes are applied within the second and the application leaves not a single element janky. Check out the video below by Mr. Chum for another first look, hands on walk-through of FloatUI.\n\nWhat do you think of FloatUI? Let us know in the comments below! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:27:32.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
