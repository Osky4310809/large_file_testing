Cole Bringing \"4 Your Eyez Only\" Documentary To HBO March 24, 2017 | 10:55 AM 1 \nDreamville, USA – J. Cole is teaming up with HBO and director Scott Lazer again for a documentary based on the release of last year’s 4 Your Eyez Only . Previously, the team linked up for last year’s 2014 Forest Hill Drive documentary. \nIncorporating music from Cole’s fourth full-length studio album, the one-hour documentary has him visiting areas like Baton Rouge and his hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina. \n“The documentary promises to illustrate how their struggles over viable housing, voting laws for felons, integration, and more mirror the frustrations felt across the nation,” reported Entertainment Weekly. \nBefore the release of 4 Your Eyez Only, Cole dropped a 40-minute film called Eyez, which was directed by Lazer as well. \nIn June, Cole plans on supporting the project with a tour that kicks off in Columbia, SC. \nThe new documentary is set to premiere Saturday, April 15 at 10 p.m. EST.
