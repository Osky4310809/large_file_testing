Often viewed and treated as prey by other animals and humans, their timid reactions to other species is understandable. As natural hunters , cats are also known for being very cautious individuals. This is why this video of a gentle doe and purring Tuxedo cat nuzzling and kissing in the forest is just so incredibly special. \nNestled in a large pile of crisp autumn leaves, the love between these two animals in undeniable.
