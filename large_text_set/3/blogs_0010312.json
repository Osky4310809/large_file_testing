It's more likely that it will be called the iPhone 8. \nApple may even decide to go for something completely different - the iPhone 10 perhaps, to mark the anniversary, or even the iPhone Air or iPhone Pro, to reflect the iPad lineup. All-glass design \nApple is allegedly planning a major design overhaul for the iPhone 8. The company is said to be working on an all-glass version of its iconic iPhone , for release in 2017. \nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a track record of leaking accurate information on Apple products, published a report in May claiming the American tech firm will completely redesign the iPhone in 2017. \nInstead of the aluminium casing used in the iPhone 7 , Apple will move to an all-glass enclosure. iPhone concept image via Twitter / @GlobalFlare (Photo: Twitter / @GlobalFlare) \nThis wouldn't be the first time Apple has used glass in its iPhones. The iPhone 4 and 4s had glass front and back panels, with a stainless steel band sandwiched between the two. \nHowever, these phones were plagued by durability issues, with many customers claiming their phones cracked too easily when dropped . \nKuo noted that some investors are concerned that glass casing would be too heavy or fail a drop test, but said he believes that a return to glass casing will not be problematic for Apple. The phone screen break is the fear of all avid smartphone users (Photo: Getty) \n\"Apple already uses glass casing for iPhone 4/ 4S, and non-Apple brands have also been using glass casings. We therefore think a drop test will not be problematic for glass casing,\" he wrote in his report, according to MacRumours . \n\"A glass casing may be slightly heavier than an aluminum one of the same thickness, but the difference is so small that the use of the thinner and lighter AMOLED panel will compensate for that.\" Read More This ultra-strong glass could spell the end for smashed smartphone screens \nThe rumour has been backed up by a couple of other leaks. A source reportedly told Japanese website Nikkei that \"Foxconn has been trying glass chassis' since last year.\" \nThe arguments to be made for a glass smartphone include better antenna reception and more options for wireless charging. Curved OLED display \nAt least one of the iPhone 8 prototypes is said to feature a new cutting-edge curved OLED display with practically no bezels - similar to that used on Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. \nAlthough there is no functional reason to have a curved screen, Samsung has been seeing significantly higher sales of the curved versions of its Galaxy smartphones. Concept image of an iPhone with curved OLED display (Photo: Martin Hajek) \nIn March 2016, Nikkei reported that Apple was planning to ditch LCD displays in favour of OLED screens, with the first OLED iPhone arriving in 2017. \nThen in April, The Korea Herald reported that Samsung had managed to bag the $2.59 billion manufacturing contract. The company is reportedly contracted to supply 100 million 5.5-inch OLED panels per year, starting from 2017. \nOLED displays are superior to the LCD panels currently used in Appleâ€™s iPhones because, rather than requiring a backlight, an OLED-based screen lights up individual pixels when necessary. Read More Apple is testing more than 10 versions of the iPhone 8 - and at least one has a CURVED screen \nThis translates to blacker blacks and brighter whites, lower power consumption and faster response times compared to LED displays. \nThe iPhone 8 's display could also have a 4K resolution - which would make it more suitable for virtual reality applications. End of the Home button \nRumours have been swirling for some time that Apple is planning to get rid of the traditional physical Home button and replace it with a touch-sensitive digital button. \nThis was originally rumoured for the iPhone 7, but it's now looking more likely that it will be one of the major changes coming with the iPhone 8. Weidlich has turned the entire front of the futuristic smartphone into a screen (Photo: Marek Weidlich) \nA Chinese website called Storm reports that the virtual home button will have the same haptic feedback motors used in the iPhone 7 to create the illusion of a Home button, even if it's really just a flat capacitive surface. \nDesigners around the world have been speculating about what Apple has planned, and one artist, Marek Weidlich , has created an intriguing concept video (see above). \nWeidlich has turned the entire front of the futuristic smartphone into a screen - leaving no home button or any visible bezel. Read More Latest iPad clues suggest iPhone 8 redesign - and another massive feature may be dropped \nAnother concept by industrial designer Herman Haidin envisions an iPhone made from a material known as \"liquidmetal\", which is tougher and more water-resistant than typical aluminium. \nIn the concept, Haidin envisions the new iPhone as a mere 3mm thick with a body formed of glass and liquidmetal. Amazing 'liquidmetal' iPhone 7 concept shows what Apple's next-generation smartphone could look like (Photo: Herman Haidin) \nIn order to get to this level of thinness, the concept ditches bulky ports such as the Lightning charging port and the 3.5mm headphone jack, as well as the physical Home button. Wireless charging \nWireless charging has become a common feature of some Android smartphones - including Samsung's latest family of devices - although it is still a lot slower than wired charging methods. Some of Samsung's devices can already be charged wirelessly (Photo: Samsung) \nA report in Bloomberg in January claimed that Apple was working on \"cutting edge\" wireless technology that would allow future iPhones and iPads to be placed further away from charging mats than current smartphones. \nThe unnamed sources said Apple was working on overcoming \"technical barriers including loss of power over distance,\" and that the technology will feature in iPhones coming out in 2017. Iris scanner \nOne of the stand-out features of Samsung 's latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7 , is eye-scanning technology, allowing users to unlock their phone by simply looking at it.

Three sizes \nApple is rumoured to be working on three versions of its next iPhone, including a 5-inch model to sit between its existing 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch handsets. \nJapanese blog Mac Otakara reports that all three models will boast identical specifications , citing sources within Apple's Taiwanese supply chain. \nThe 5-inch version is also rumoured to feature a dual-lens camera, with iSight modules arranged vertically instead of horizontally.

Specs iPhone concept (Photo: Yasser Farahi) \nThe iPhone 8 will, more than likely, feature an A11 chip, built on ARM's highly-efficient 10nm manufacturing process, and run the next version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11. \nIt will most likely come in 32BB, 128GB and 256GB storage options. Camera \nIf you were hoping that the next version of Apple's 4.7-inch iPhone was going to feature a dual-lens camera, you may be disappointed. \nAccording to the latest investor note from well-informed KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's dual-camera system will remain exclusive to the larger \"Plus\" model next year. Dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus \n\"While an attractive addition for avid picture takers and professional photographers, the iPhone 7 Plus dual-camera is not a mass-market killer application yet,\" Kuo says in the note seen by Apple Insider and 9to5Mac . \n\"Along with its high cost (estimated at over US$30-40) and the necessity for Apple to enhance the added value of high-end iPhone models, we expect only high-end new iPhone models (30-40% of them) to have a dual-camera next year.\" \nHowever, Kuo thinks that Apple's next iPhone could come with a \"revolutionary\" new selfie camera that uses infrared technology to detect the location and depth of objects in its field of vision. \nThe 3D camera system could be used for facial recognition, iris recognition and 3D selfies. It could also be used in augmented reality mobile games, to accurately replace a character's head with that of the user, Kuo wrote in a research report seen by 9to5mac . Smiling teenage girl taking a selfie with smartphone (Photo: REX/Shutterstock) \nThe 3D system works by sending invisible infrared light signals outwards from the phone and then detecting the signals that bounce back off of objects using the 1.4 megapixel infrared receiver. \nKuo said that, in the future, Apple could add 3D sensing technology to its rear cameras as well, removing the need for large dual camera iris systems. Waterproof iPhone \nApple's iPhone 7 is water-resistant to a depth of one metre for up to 30 minutes - a rating known as IP67, which is the same as the Apple Watch . \nIt therefore makes sense that Apple would carry this through to the iPhone 8. \nIP67 means it will survive a dip in the sink or down the loo, and it won't break if you pour a drink over it, but you probably don't want to take it swimming.
