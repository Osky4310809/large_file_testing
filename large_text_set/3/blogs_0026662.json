Winnings paid in free bets. T&C's apply. \nRepublic of Ireland 10/1 (11.00) to beat Wales \nMartin O’Neill’s men are marginal favourites to come out on top of the encounter in Dublin despite their visitors’ attacking intent, but heated ties such as this one have shown to swing either way. \nFormerly 5/4 (2.25) to come out on top, Betfair have upped the offer to 10/1 (11.00) for new customers to back Republic of Ireland to triumph in this one. The Boys in Green are unbeaten in their last six internationals with Wales, winning three and drawing three while keeping a clean sheet in four of the last five meetings. \nIn the hosts’ favour is that the last time Wales were able to beat them came in February 1992, and Ireland have not lost in their last 14 international fixtures at the Aviva Stadium - winning their last four home qualifiers to equal their best run from September 1999. \nLed by Jonathan Walters, who has netted six times in his last seven home games for his country, Ireland certainly pose a formidable threat to their neighbours and can be claimed at 10/1 (11.00) on the road to Russia. Wales 16/1 (17.00) to beat Republic of Ireland \nHowever, it’s impossible to overlook Wales’ prospects for the clash, especially when they have a man like Gareth Bale in their ranks. Originally 12/5 (3.40) to end their derby woes, Betfair have come up with a whopping 16/1 (17.00) offer for new customers to back Chris Coleman’s men to claim three points. \nThe Dragons have lost only of their last seven qualifiers on the road under Coleman, with the individual brilliance of Bale ensuring they will always be in the reckoning to extend that run at the Aviva Stadium and end their 25-year hoodoo on Irish soil. \nWhile not yet at his best after returning from injury, Bale’s run of four goals in four World Cup qualifying matches so far is nothing to sniff at with the Real Madrid star capable of pulling moments of magic out of his hat. Indeed, the 27-year-old’s total tally of 17 strikes in his last 23 qualifiers means he is within two goals of matching Ian Rush’s tally as his nation’s all-time top goalscorer - something he will be more than motivated to do in Dublin to fire Wales to a vital win that new Betfair customers can now back at 16/1 (17.00) .
