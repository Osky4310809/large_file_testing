I couldn’t. I literally am incapable of being in the real world and surviving.” Also Read: Mariah Carey's Ex-Husband Defends NYE Debacle, But Trashes Her Reality Show \nWhile the “Glitter” singer said she doesn’t let drama like that get to her anymore, she’s not afraid to point the finger of blame at everyone … even her backup dancers. \n“I used to get upset by things,” she said. “This was out of my control, and had everything not been such a total chaotic mess, then I would have been able to make something happen. Even the dancers should have stopped dancing and helped me off the f—ing stage. \n“I’m sorry. It was a mess, and I blame everybody, and I blame myself for not leaving after rehearsal.” Also Read: Mariah Carey Calls NYE Debacle 'An Opportunity to Humiliate Me' (Audio) \nIn case you’ve forgotten, Carey suffered a particularly awkward audio malfunction on ABC’s “ Dick Clark ‘s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve.” The pop singer never actually did any singing that evening, when she instead just battled non-functioning earpieces live and on-stage . \nThe singer couldn’t hear herself — but the rest of the world could sure hear the music and backing track for her hit single, “Emotions”— including all those pre-recorded high notes. \nIf you need a reminder of the debacle, watch the video courtesy of Rolling Stone below. \nRead original story Mariah Carey Blames ‘Everybody’ for New Year’s Eve ‘Chaotic Mess’ At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.
