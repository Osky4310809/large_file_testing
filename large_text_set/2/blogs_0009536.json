If the cast is making us root for it, the premise of the film is making us restless to check it out. It’s so inspiring to know that a mission of such nature was launched in India but was kept under wraps successfully. If that isn’t making our wait difficult, the new poster has just made us anxious for it. With all the actors on target, this poster is very gripping. (Also read: Rana Daggubati and Suriya gonna party real soon, courtesy The Ghazi Attack ) \nThe tag line of The War You Didn’t Know About has so much promise in it, that we are now dying to watch it. The film speaks about a submarine mission where INS Vikrant was the target of Pakistan. Nobody spoke about it until now and we can’t be more proud. Our history has so many such tales where our defence forces have left us proud. It’s really great to see such stories been told. It stars Rana Daggubati who plays Arjun Varma, Lt.Commander, S2, Kay Kay Menon as Captain Ranvijay Singh, S21, Atul Kulkarni as Devraj, Executive Officer, S21 and Taapsee Pannu as Ananya, a refugee. The makers had released an interesting video where officers from 1971 opened up about the Ghazi Attack – here’s what Vice Admiral – R.N. Ganesh had to say, “The greatest enemy of an aircraft carrier is a submarine. And Pakistan sent their only submarine to stalk Vikrant and find the opportunity to put it out of action. Ghazi left Karachi and came over to the Bay of Bengal. A Naval Commander was made aware of this danger and he knew that INS Vikrant must be kept out of harm’s way.” Rear Admiral S.K. Gupta also added, “In this case because it was shrouded in secrecy, Pakistan hadn’t declared war on us, nor us on them. It was done in secret. The whole thing was, if they got Vikrant, then to them it was the end of the war. It didn’t matter. Our pride would be hurt and their pride would be skyrocketing.” \nSo far the trailer has been lauded for its unusual story and its compelling visuals. This is a rare war at sea where the team was shot inside a submarine. The film will release in Telugu and Hindi. \n— Dharma Productions (@DharmaMovies) February 8, 2017 \nSo how many of you are watching it this Friday?
