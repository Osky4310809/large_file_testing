Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports \nChris Sale’s ability to throw a baseball isn’t really in doubt. But the left-hander raised a few eyebrows off the field last season during a bizarre incident with the Chicago White Sox’s front office. \nSale has changed “Sox,” though, and he’s clearly ready to put that thread behind him. \nThe Boston Red Sox’s prized offseason acquisition addressed the media Tuesday at the team’s spring training facility in Fort Myers, Fla., and it wasn’t long before he was asked about last June’s fiasco in which he cut up the White Sox’s throwback uniforms before a start. \n“It wasn’t exactly between the white lines, but it all goes into just the passion I have for playing the game,” Sale told reporters in a press conference aired on NESN. “Things are going to happen.

If you keep making the same mistakes, well, you’re kind of spinning your tires.” \nSale then was asked how he’d react if the same incident happened in Boston, and he responded with a zinger. \n“I don’t think they have throwbacks here,” Sale joked. \nTechnically speaking, Sale is incorrect; the Red Sox rocked 1975 throwback uniforms and have had a few other retro jerseys up their sleeves in recent years. But the 27-year-old ace still got his message across: His White Sox days are over, and his focus is on living up to the high expectations he’ll face this season in Boston. \n“It was something I learned from,” Sale added. “I’ll leave it at that.\" \nThis article first appeared on NESN.com and was syndicated with permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:53:46.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
