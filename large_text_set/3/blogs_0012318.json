It’s a softly sprung, high-riding SUV in a class of tall wagons, and cargo- and people-hauling capacities benefit accordingly. A 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder is standard, but the NX300h boasts the lineup’s sole hybrid powertrain and gets all-wheel drive, too. The cabin coddles occupants with comfy leather seats and distinctive styling. Unfortunately, a finicky touchpad-operated infotainment system spoils an otherwise ergonomic interior. What’s New for 2017? \nIntroduced as a new model in 2015, the NX carries on through 2016 and into 2017 with few changes. The NX300h hybrid’s front-wheel-drive option has been dropped in favor of standard all-wheel drive. A new 18-inch wheel design joins the options list, as well as two vibrant new colors—Ultrasonic Blue Mica 2.0 and Molten Pearl—for F Sport models. Lexus has added Scout GPS Link as a standard feature; it uses a smartphone app to offer turn-by-turn directions displayed on the infotainment screen.
