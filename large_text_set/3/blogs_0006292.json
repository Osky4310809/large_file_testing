The company claimed that the SUV is part of its eco-friendly vehicle program that will see 14 or more new clean and green models introduced by 2020. \nThe design is inspired by nature and the car’s only emission, water. That’s clear to see in the flowing lines found in the front lighting, centre air intake and tail lights. There are also rear air foils in the D-pillars as well as integrated air vents throughout the vehicle to improve aerodynamic efficiency. The blue interior is fairly clean and minimalist too, save for the Mercedes-style digital screens ahead of the driver. \nHyundai’s new fuel cell powertrain in the FE is in its fourth generation – compared to the one in the Tucson Fuel Cell , it’s 20% lighter and 10% more efficient; its power density has also been increased by 30%, improving range significantly from 594 km to over 800 km. The company says that the move to increase range acknowledges the currently limited hydrogen infrastructure. \nAlso featured on the FE are powerbanks for personal devices such as smartphones, charged by the car’s energy output. At the rear, there’s space for the folding electric scooter that Hyundai debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January, which can also be charged there. \nHyundai says that a new hydrogen-powered SUV will go on sale in 2018, inspired by the FE and featuring a long range as well as advanced “Hyundai Smart Sense” driver assistance technologies.
