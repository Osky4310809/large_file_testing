The studio is also discussing other possible candidates, including Swedish director Daniel Espinosa.\nDavid Ayer directed the first movie, which featured an all-star cast of Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and more. The film premiered to less-than-favorable reviews , but still managed to gross $745 million worldwide — enough to get executives focused on fast-tracking a sequel.\n\nThat Gibson is even being considered for the job marks a bit of a turnaround for the actor-director’s career. He’s back in the spotlight thanks to his Oscar-nominated movie, Hacksaw Ridge, following years of obscurity after a drunk driving arrest and his anti-Semitic comments in the early 2000s.\nThe Reporter also states he is in talks to join Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg for Paramount’s Daddy’s Home 2 and indie crime movie Dragged Across Concrete . Stay tuned for more information.\nIn other news, Pusha T confirms Kanye West is working on an album .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:48:18.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
