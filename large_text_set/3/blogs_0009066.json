It's dead,\" Arum told Rafael. \n\"I'm talking to him about another proposal for another fight, not Khan. Khan won't be Manny's next opponent,\" he added. \nKoncz had spearheaded talks with an investment group from the United Arab Emirates that has reportedly dangled a $38 million fund for Pacquiao to face Khan in the country.   \nArum said that fight might still happen, but not on the planned May 20 date. \n\"UAE would not happen until November, if it happens at all, but I doubt it will,\" said the veteran promoter. \nWhile Koncz worked on the UAE deal, Arum set his sights on Australia, sitting down with representatives of prospect Jeff Horn for a fight in Brisbane. Pacquiao, however, was keen on taking on Khan instead, effectively killing the negotiations with Horn’s people. \nArum had been skeptical of the proposal from the UAE for a Pacquiao-Khan showdown, and he turned out to be true. \n“When they contacted me [about the Khan deal], I told them it was pie in the sky, that this is crazy, it’s not going to happen,” Arum said in a separate interview with Lance Pugmire of the Los Angeles Times. “Manny wanted to roll the dice. He rolled the dice and it came up snake eyes. \n“If something is too good to be true, it’s too good to be true,” he continued. \nPacquiao went for Khan after the British fighter topped a Twitter poll put up by Pacquiao asking his followers who should he fight next. The other choices were Khan’s countryman Kell Brook, rising star Terence Crawford and Horn. \nUnfortunately for Pacquiao and his fans, they will not get what they want. \n“That deal is done for now. [Pacquiao and Koncz] were talking to the wrong people,” Arum also told the LA Times.
