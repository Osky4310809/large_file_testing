First, amid the recent push to defund Planned Parenthood , the actress accessorized her embroidered pink Andrew Gn gown with a Fuck Paul Ryan pin. But she also expressed a bold message when it came to her own body—taking the opportunity to shirk conventional Hollywood norms by stepping out with visibly grown-out underarm hair. \nKirke isn’t the first woman to cameo her body hair on the formal red carpet. In fact, the Kirke family has a history of flaunting the natural look: Her older sister, Jemima Kirke, also opted to go untrimmed at the CFDA Fashion Awards back in 2015. In fact, going proudly unshaven has long been a theme among boundary-pushing women in Hollywood: Back in 2005, actress Drew Barrymore went natural in a barely there slip dress while arm in arm with Marc Jacobs, while Juliette Lewis has been known to skip the razor when it comes to her underarms. \nA photo posted by Lola Kirke (@lolakirke) on Dec 19, 2016 at 4:40pm PST \n\nStill, Kirke’s much-photographed moment is perhaps most reminiscent of Julia Roberts, who waved to the crowd with grown-out underarms at the London Notting Hill premiere in 1999. The moment was widely publicized—as well as criticized—but has since remained a pave-the-way moment for women who wish to go natural with their body hair. Because on and off the red carpet, confidence is the ultimate accessory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T08:30:15.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
