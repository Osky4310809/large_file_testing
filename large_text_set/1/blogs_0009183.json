Bono’s bell-like voice and The Edge’s ringing guitar lines were honed to deceptively simple melodic perfection, bolstered by the rhythm section’s propulsive marches and airy atmospherics from producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. They were firing on all cylinders here, attacking social barriers (“Where the Streets Have No Name”) and insipid politics (“Bullet the Blue Sky”) while making heartbreak sound anthemic (“With or Without You”). Customer Reviews Warning to \"Complete U2\" Owners... by Mista Ali G I spent $50.00 on U2's The Joshua Tree Remastered Limited Edition 2CD + DVD set, ripped it to iTunes @ 256 AAC and think my iTunes Store purchased \"Complete U2 - The Joshua Tree\" sounds better (even at [the lower] 128 AAC level). For whatever reason the \"The Joshua Tree\" version contained in iTunes' \"The Complete U2\" comes off clearer (and louder?) than both the new Island remaster and the old/Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs version(s). Your money would be best spent to retain your previously purchased files and only chase after tracks 20, 22, 23, 24, and 25 as these tracks are indeed new to iTunes and are not in \"The Complete U2\" which should now be renamed the \"Incomplete or Almost Complete U2\" if you consider the mound of missing songs from compilations, b-sides, guest appearances etc. that are absent. What Mastering Does: by inthesun 1. Volume Level Maximization 2. Ensuring a Consistent Balance of Frequencies 3. Noise Reduction 4. Encoding 5. Error Checking This ensures the integrity of the data stream during CD duplication / replication at any CD manufacturing plant. REMASTERING STINKS!!! DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!! by Supermonkeyboy THE SONIC FIDELITY OF THIS CLASSIC ALBUM, ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME IS DESTROYED BY DIGITAL COMPRESSION!!! I JUST COMPARED EVERY SONG! NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT IN A BLIND HEADPHONE TEST WITH MY GIRLFRIEND WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT MUSIC AND SHE PICKED THE ORIGINAL 1987 CD EVERYTIME! IF YOU BUY THIS - YOU WILL EXPERIENCE A SLIGHTLY LOUDER VOLUME, BUT YOU WILL LOSE CLARITY, SPACIOUSNESS, THE DELICATILY OF THE HIGHS AND LOWS AND DIGITAL COMPRESSION KILLS THE ORIGINAL SOUND THE ORGINAL PRODUCERS CREATED! HERE IS A QUOTE FROM AN ARTICLE \"Music nostalgia is nothing new, but this is different. There are solid technical reasons why CDs mastered today sound inferior to those made 15 years ago. The engineers who make the \"master\" - the mix from which the CD is pressed - are under irresistible pressure to compromise sound quality.Tim Young masters albums at the Metropolis Studios in London. He has impeccable credentials, having worked with bands from the Clash and the Smiths back in the 1970s to Madonna, Iron Maiden and the Sugababes today. \"Everyone's chasing immediate impact,\" he explains. \"What happens is all the loud parts of the album have to be as loud as the opening track. So you get a fatiguing effect. There's no light and shade in it.\" EDUCATE YOURSELF! READ THIS ARTICLE... http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1992325,00.html Biography Formed: 1976 in Dublin, Ireland Genre: Rock Years Active: '70s, '80s, '90s, '00s, '10s Through a combination of zealous righteousness and post-punk experimentalism, U2 became one of the most popular rock & roll bands in the world -- equally known for their sweeping sound as for their grandiose statements about politics and religion. The Edge provided the group with a signature sound by creating sweeping sonic landscapes with his heavily processed, echoed guitars. Though the Edge's style wasn't conventional, the rhythm section of Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton played the songs...
