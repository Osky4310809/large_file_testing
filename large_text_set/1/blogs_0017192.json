Damon said he hopes President Trump, shown here in 2004, will be open to backing clean-water programs. (Peter Kramer/Getty Images) \nDamon told The Associated Press on Saturday that clean water accessibility isn't a partisan issue and demands \"an all-hands-on-deck approach to solve this.\" The actor has publicly supported Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. \nWhen asked his response to the election, Damon demurred and said he hopes Trump will be open to backing clean-water programs like his nonprofit Water.org. Said Damon: \"Hopefully we'll get our turn.\" \nIn 2009, Damon founded Water.org with civil engineer Gary White. It uses micro-finance loans to bring hygienic connections to water and toilets to impoverished communities. Damon also spoke about the issue at the Davos Forum last week.
