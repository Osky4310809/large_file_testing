(SpaceX Photo) Three student teams got through the engineering gauntlet and sent their Hyperloop pods through a mile-long tube to test a new mode of transportation today.\nThe pod races were the climax of this weekend’s first-ever Hyperloop competition – hosted by SpaceX at its headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., and backed by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who came up with the Hyperloop concept in 2013.\nMusk said 27 teams, including a squad from the University of Washington, brought their fast-moving, high-tech machines to Hawthorne for testing. But only three of them – coming from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and Germany’s Technical University of Munich – passed all the preliminaries required for a full tube run.\nThe German team, known as WARR Hyperloop, clocked the fastest time, traveling through the vacuum tube at a maximum speed of 94 kilometers per hour (58 mph). Delft that won the overall prize, which took factors such as design and safety as well as speed into account.\nCongrats to WARR Hyperloop team for fastest pod–flew down entire length of track at the world's first Hyperloop competition! #breakapod pic.twitter.com/FhMjmCUZTQ \n— Hyperloop (@Hyperloop) January 30, 2017 \nThe biggest star of the show, however, was Musk himself. Students flocked around the billionaire as he strode past the teams’ booths and inspected the hardware.\n“You’ve done incredible work,” he told them during an afternoon gathering. “Well done.”\nMusk said the volunteer effort was just one step along a path he hoped would eventually lead to a transportation network that’s capable of carrying people at near-supersonic speeds between San Francisco and Los Angeles in about a half-hour.\n“What this is really intended to do is to encourage innovation in transport technology,” he said. “To get people excited about new forms of transport, things that may be completely different from what we see today.”\nFirst ever vacuum tube Hyperloop run: watch the wheel #MITHyperloop @SpaceX @hyperloop #maglevworks pic.twitter.com/0TXlOT7bk6 \n— MIT Hyperloop (@MITHyperloop) January 30, 2017 \nSpaceX built the enclosed test track, which Musk said was “the second-biggest vacuum chamber in the world, after the Large Hadron Collider.” But it was up to the teams to build the scaled-down test pods, which showed off magnetic levitation and other exotic technologies.\nOne team, Japan’s Keio Alpha, designed the components of its pod so they could be carried in the luggage of team members as they made their way to SpaceX’s headquarters, which is about six miles from Los Angeles International Airport.\nMusk gave a shout-out not only to SpaceX’s Hyperloop tube, but also to his plans to dig a tunnel that could provide a short cut through Los Angeles’ tangled traffic.\nOur vehicle is entering the tube!

I find holes in the ground exciting, I was discussing this with my girlfriend. She didn’t find it that exciting, but I thought it was really great. It’s right there, you can check it out.”\nLast week, the Daily Breeze reported that this initial tunnel would go beneath Crenshaw, one of L.A.’s busiest thoroughfares, merely to let employees walk from one side of the street to the other without having to cross traffic.\nBut Musk said the tunnel could blaze a trail for far more ambitious holes in the ground:\n“That’s going to be the start, a hole for the tunnel boring machine. We’re going to just try to figure out what it takes to improve tunneling speed by … somewhere between 500 and 1,000 percent is, I think, possible, if you apply a limit-of-physics approach. We’ll see how far we can get. We’re just sort of muddling along. We have no idea what we’re doing, let’s be clear about that.\n“We’re going to get this machine, figure it out, OK, take it apart, [and find out] how do we make it go much faster while still being safe and not affecting people on the surface and all that. We’ll see how much progress we can make. But I’m actually quite optimistic that tunneling can be improved by at least fivefold, maybe tenfold.\n“That’s really key to a lot of technologies: road tunnels, Hyperloop tunnels, train tunnels. Because fundamentally you have to go 3-D in a city. If you’ve got tall buildings, they’re all 3-D. And then everyone wants to go into the building and leave the building at the same time. So then on a 2-D road network, that obviously does not work. You have to go 3-D, either up or down, and I think probably down … and then for longer distances, [for] things like the Hyperloop and other ideas.”\nMusk’s focus on tunnels suggests that if the full-scale Hyperloop ever does get built, he might prefer to see a below-ground system rather than a network of elevated tubes.\nIt may not be totally up to him: At least two ventures, Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies , are trying to develop commercial transit systems without Musk’s participation. But thanks to today’s comments, the subject of tunnel-boring technology will probably sound a lot less boring than it has in the past.\nDavid Coven of @uwhyperloop shows me his team's pod. He said they were able to build it for about $25k, plus donated materials. pic.twitter.com/RA8buJbcZJ \n— Meredith R.
