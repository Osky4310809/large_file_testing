It enrolls 291 students through Florida’s tax credit scholarship program, out of a total school enrollment of 340. In an opinion article in the Orlando Sentinel on Thursday, Ms. Peters-Gipson said the school offered “a rigorous blend of academics and faith.” “The parents who come through our doors don’t tend to see public and private as somehow in conflict,” she said. “They’re just looking for the school that will best serve their children.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story At a round-table discussion with Mr. Trump after his visit to the classroom, Ms. Peters-Gipson and others praised the success of the scholarship program. Henry Fortier, the superintendent of Catholic schools, said that graduates of the Florida scholarship program statewide scored higher than other public school students on the SAT and had high graduation rates. “I know that there’s a lot of controversy about school choice,” Mr. Fortier told the president.

During the round-table discussion at the school, Mr. Trump quoted the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as saying that he hoped inferior education would become a thing of the past. The president said that working toward a national school choice policy would help make that a reality. \nAdvertisement “Betsy’s going to lead the charge, right?” Mr. Trump said, turning to his education secretary. “You bet,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:54:06.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
