Instead, it impaled the car, a Volvo, before hitting the teenager in the head and chest killing her instantly. \nA $2,790 bill was sent to Ms Elmers by the state’s department of transportation, USA today reported. \nIt was intended to cover the cost of labour and materials to replace the 25-feet section of the rail. \nSteve Elmers, Hannah’s father, was outraged by both the bill and his conviction that the rail was not safe. \n\"I’m shocked, the audacity,\" he said. \n\"What bothers me is that they’re playing Russian roulette with people's lives. They know these devices do not perform at high speeds and in situations like my daughter’s accident, but they leave them in place.\" \nA spokesman for Tennessee said the bill was sent in error and has apologised to the family.
