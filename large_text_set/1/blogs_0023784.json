Who can stop me? They will have to put me in jail,” she said. “If [Judge Farber] puts me in prison, I will continue to work on plans.” \nTrec currently owes money to the ASPCA who seized, housed and adopted out the 90 bunnies removed from Trec’s yard after her arrest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T00:56:56.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
