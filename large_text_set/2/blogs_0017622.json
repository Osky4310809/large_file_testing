In a recent Snapchat, the mother of two told her millions of followers that she paid her cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Simon Ourian a visit to help get rid of her stretch marks. \"I feel so excited that I finally did it,\" she said using a voice-changing Snapchat filter with bunny ears. \n\"I've been so scared to do it thinking it hurts so badly, and it didn't hurt that badly,\" she continued. \"So I'm so grateful, and I'm so excited. I love you Dr. Ourian!\" A post shared by Dr. Simon Ourian - Epione (@simonourianmd1) on Feb 19, 2017 at 7:59pm PST \nAccording to E! News , the stretch mark removal procedure costs between $2,900 and $4,900 per area and involves cooling the skin using a CoolBeam laser to vaporize superficial cells. After removing 10 millionth of an inch of skin tissue at a time, the results are permanent, though patients usually need a few days to recover. \nThis isn't the first time Kardashian West has paid Dr. Simon Ourian a visit. She previously visited the dermatologist for infamously having her belly button tightened. \n\"Thank you, dear #kimkardashian, for introducing myself and Epione to your Snapchat friends!\" Ourian wrote on Instagram , reposting Kardashian's Snapchat videos. \"Nonsurgical skin tightening after a couple of pregnancies. We are doing Ultraskintight. It can tighten the skin all over the body.\" \nWhile we're all about accepting your stretch marks, cellulite, and more, the decision to get procedures like this are personal . And whether or not you'd do something similar yourself, you've gotta appreciate Kim K's honesty.
