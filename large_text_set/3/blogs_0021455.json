But this winter they added a second location: Hi-Tech Automotive, a car repair garage in Silver Lake.

The business is owned by a relative of Piskoulian's, who let Banh Oui add a couple appliances — whatever was required to get a temporary license from the county health department — and begin serving a fun menu of Vietnamese-inspired food like sticky chicken wings, salt and pepper calamari and pork spare ribs. \nThe pop-up serves banh mi, of course, and it's a good rendition of the classic sandwich: Felton doesn't skimp on the pickled carrot and daikon, which is especially great on the meaty, fatty pork belly version. \nBut the one item you must order — seriously, don't go here and just not order it — is the shrimp toast. This greasy dim sum classic doesn't get a lot of attention among food nerds these days (it has sort of mid-century, San Francisco Chinatown connotations), but Banh Oui could be responsible for a resurgence. This version is heavy with oil, sure, but even heavier with chopped shrimp and toasted sesame seeds. It is then — this is the key part — topped topped with a handful of mint, cilantro and chopped scallions, and dressed with just a touch of sriracha and sweet mayo. Those herbs make this dish truly beautiful, something worth driving a distance for. \nFelton and Piskoulian might try to get another license so they can keep serving at Hi-Tech, but for now the pop up will end March 31. After that, who knows, maybe we'll see a chain of shrimp toast shacks from them. \nWed. and Fri., 11 a.m.-6 p.m. 4000 Fountain Ave., Silver Lake. banhoui.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:30:01.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
