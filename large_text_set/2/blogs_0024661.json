Earlier this week, Emma Stone rocked a floral-printed ensemble that is perfect for spring , and now we need it to be warm already. We’re so done with the cold!\nOn Wednesday, Stone arrived at a private dinner to honor director Damien Chazelle and the rest of the La La Land cast , but she definitely stole the show.\nWhile posing on the carpet in front of the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, it was clear that Stone wasn’t falling for the “winter” season we’re currently under. That being said, it was like, REALLY cold in LA last night.\nRegardless, the stunning redhead donned the perfect spring outfit, with its floral pattern and no-sleeve style. We’re kind of obsessed with the Giambattista Valli Haute Couture number that Stone rocked yesterday.\nIt’s SO pretty. Charley Gallay/Getty Images The dress and matching skirt have flowers and pretty plants printed on them for a dainty detail you can’t help but notice. The cream paired with the pastel pops of color are basically an advertisement for spring. Easter brunch inspiration, anyone?\nPlus, we can’t get over that fluffy belt. It’s stunning! Charley Gallay/Getty Images Oh, and in case you thought that Stone’s makeup wouldn’t be flawless as well, here’s a closer look at it. Not only was her outfit fit for warmer months, but her makeup was ready for Spring Break too.\nThe blue/purple pastel hue around her eyes, paired with the slightly pink lip, is so fresh and flowery. Plus, you can’t have a fun night out without a little ear candy, and on that note, Stone never disappoints.\nCharley Gallay/Getty Images The real question, however, is why doesn’t the Gangster Squad star have a fashion Instagram? We’d follow it in an instant.\nNow, what do you think about Stone’s spring look? Does it make you want to go running through fields of flowers? Or, is that just us?\nEither way, we love this stylish wardrobe choice and can’t wait to see what the Arizona native wears to the Oscars on Sunday.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:29:21.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
