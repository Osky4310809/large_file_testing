On Monday he told Bild that contract talks are currently on hold. \n\"There have been no further talks,\" Meyer, who has completed the full 90 minutes only eight times this season despite making a total of 32 appearances for the club, told Bild. \nThis summer would be Schalke's last chance to cash in on the forward, but when asked whether he was interested in signing a new deal, he said: \"Why not? I can perceive both things. The chances are 50-50.\" \nMeyer had told ZDF TV at the weekend that Schalke currently \"have little time\" for contract talks given their difficult situation in Bundesliga, and the contract situation of Sead Kolasinac, who could leave on a free transfer this summer, and midfielder Leon Goretzka, whose deal also expires in 2018. \nAccording to reports in Bild, Meyer is currently leaning toward ending his seven-year spell at Schalke this summer, and the club could allow him a transfer if an offer were to exceed €20 million. \nIn 2016, Tottenham made a €45m bid for the midfielder during the final days of the summer transfer window. \nStephan Uersfeld is the Germany correspondent for ESPN FC.
