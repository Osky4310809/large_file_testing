We accept people for who they are.”\nWe can see why that is. Brady does have to throw him the ball after all.\nIt's an emotional week & #Patriots fans will appreciate this message from @MartysaurusRex . @rachelbonnetta reporting for @GarbageTime #SB51 pic.twitter.com/D4yqxEbbQy \n— Garbage Time (@GarbageTime) February 2, 2017 \n\nIt’s worth noting that Tom Brady declined President Obama’s invite to the White House when he honored the Patriots last win. He said he had a “family commitment” and went on vacay with Giselle and their kids. \nBut anyways, back to Super Bowl Marty… \nOne of our favorite moments from Bennett came when he brought his 3-year-old daughter Jet to the press conference with him. She completely took over!\n. @MartysaurusRex 's adorable daughter stole the show with this funny moment in the postgame press conference. pic.twitter.com/Od0KMzLqme \n— AtTheBuzzer (@TheBuzzerOnFOX) February 6, 2017 \n#WendyPeedOnTheRug \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 6, 2017 \nSuper Bowl Marty!!\n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nTE Martellus Bennett ( @MartysaurusRex ) would like to share a message with you. pic.twitter.com/yOJiTMEfKw \n— Mike Reiss (@MikeReiss) February 6, 2017 \n\nMore great moments with Marty and his family when you continue… \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:27:02.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
