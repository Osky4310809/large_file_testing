The U.S. based brand was purchased recently by Gildan Activewear, a Canadian clothing maker, for $88 million. A photo posted by American Apparel (@americanapparelusa) on Nov 15, 2016 at 5:26pm PST \nGildan spokesman Garry Bell said of the announcement, “This was always about buying assets out of bankruptcy,” Bell said. “The reality is this wasn’t a purchase of an ongoing concern.” \nAmerican Apparel gained enormous popularity in the early 2,000s, with its minimal, elevated aesthetic, provocative advertising and mainstream appeal. The company bucked retail trends by producing and distributing product entirely in the U.S., and according to the L.A. Times , founder Dov Charney “gained prominence as a vocal supporter of immigration reform and worker rights.” \nHowever, Charney was also dogged by persistent rumors of sexual harassment, which may have ultimately overshadowed reform efforts. \nThe bankruptcy deal between Gildan and American Apparel is expected to be finalized in February 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:08:25.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
