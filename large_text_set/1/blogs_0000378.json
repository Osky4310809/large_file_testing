Camarda, a real estate investor and the CIO of Jacksonville, Fla.-based Camarda Wealth Advisors. \nBecause real estate is such an inefficient market , it's possible to find awesome bargains with a very high return on investment , Camarda said. And if you can manage the property yourself, you can collect more income. If you purchase the right property at the right price and on the right terms, he said, a rental property can produce significantly more income than traditional passive investments . \nHow Much Money Do You Need? If you plan to finance your purchase with a mortgage , you'll need to take action before you retire, said associate broker Janice Leis, who serves the premier residential areas of Philadelphia and South Florida. \nMortgage lending guidelines typically require applicants to be employed and have at least two years of steady employment history in the same occupation. \nLenders also require a substantial down payment , typically 30% or more, if the buyer won't be occupying the property, said John Walters of LeWalt Consulting Group in St. Petersburg, Fla. \nIf you don't have the cash to make such a large down payment, consider using your IRA funds. All equity growth and income from rental receipts will grow inside your IRA tax-free, Walters said. Purchasing the property with funds inside a Roth IRA , on which you've already paid taxes, means all your earnings and equity can grow tax-free. \nAfter you've figured out how you're going to buy the property, you need to think about how you're going to cover ongoing expenses. Owning residential income property is like owning a principal residence in that there are variable expenses outside the mortgage, said Rob Albertson, a multi-million dollar residential real estate agent with Austin Fine Properties/PLR in Austin, Texas. There are maintenance costs for minor items (like leaky faucets) and major items (like a new roof). \nDon't forget about the costs associated with marketing and the loss of income during periods of vacancy and tenant change-over. Albertson said to factor no higher than a 92% occupancy rate into your calculations, even in a hot rental market. Be conservative in your estimates of expenses and income. \nThere are also tax benefits and liabilities to consider. \"One of the chief benefits associated with rental property is the ability to claim a depreciation deduction on your federal income tax return,\" Walters said. \nDepreciation reduces the value of your property each year to approximate wear and tear; it also lowers your tax bill each year you claim it. However, it also lowers your tax basis, which means you could pay more taxes when you sell, if you sell the property at a profit. \nFirst and foremost, discuss the financial feasibility of your plans with a CPA , a real estate attorney and an insurance agent to see how much everything will cost, Leis said. \nTax Deductions For Rental Property Owners \nChoose a Location \nBuying cheap won't help you earn a return on your investment if you can't find renters who want to lease the property, said Jenny Usaj, managing broker and owner of Usaj Realty in Denver, Colorado. \n\"While the price will be higher in better areas, the time marketing the property will decrease as well as the time it might sit vacant,\" she said. If you are unsure where to find rentals, start near downtown or near a college campus. Rental residences often follow employment opportunities.\" \nIt's also important to take a look around the neighborhood and purchase a property that reflects the area's current demographic, Usaj said. \"Is the area populated with single adults or families? Will a one-bedroom or three-bedroom residence be more appealing to the renters nearby? Again, be careful not to jump at the best bargain on the market. Make sure the property will appeal to the lifestyle of the area.\" \nWhat Will You Earn? \n\"You want to earn at least 8% from the capital invested in the rental, net of all expenses,\" said John Graves, managing principal of an independent RIA , editor of the \"Retirement Journal\" and author of The 7% Solution: You CAN Afford a Comfortable Retirement . Expenses include: the mortgage; taxes; insurance; maintenance; a 10% property management fee ; and a 10% vacancy allowance. \nIf you invest $100,000 in the property, you want to earn a net income of $8,000 a year, he said. The reasoning behind the 8% is that it compensates you for the risk and lack of liquidity of your investment. If you or your spouse can work on the property by doing repairs and maintenance and/or managing the property, your costs will decline and your income will ultimately increase, he said. \nPotential Problems \nInvestment property owners could run into a number of problems, including: renters who fail to pay; excessive maintenance costs; and difficulty finding tenants, said Cameron Novak, real estate broker and owner of the Homefinding Center in Corona, Calif. \nWorking with a reputable real estate agent with references to find your investment property is also important, he said. \nMany municipalities have imposed drastic inspections and fees on landlords who want to turn owner-occupied properties into rentals, said John Braun, a real-estate attorney with Thomas Law Group in Minneapolis and a seasoned real estate investor. Potential investors should look into these issues before committing to a purchase. They should also be aware that homestead exemptions don't apply to investment properties, which can mean higher property tax bills. \nWould-be landlords should evaluate their temperaments before jumping into property ownership as the job involves dealing with a variety of personalities. The idea that having a rental property represents passive income is not particularly accurate. \n\"Owning residential income property is not a hands-free affair,\" Albertson said. \"If you don't want to manage the property, or can't, as in you live out of town, you will be looking at 8% to 10% of your gross rents going to a management company to cover rent collection and repair requests.\" \nFinally, selecting the right tenants is key. Running a thorough tenant screening is crucial, said Albertson. \"This is the person you are entrusting with your retirement asset, so you'd better be sure you are not setting yourself up for disaster or numerous headaches.\" Hot Definitions", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T13:17:39.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
