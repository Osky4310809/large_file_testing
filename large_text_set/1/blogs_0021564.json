It’s a demanding enough track during the day, especially when you factor in that, at points, the drivers will be cresting 200 miles per hour. Then night hits and it’s a wholly different beast. Drivers prep for months to get in shape physically and are under constant monitoring by a team of engineers and doctors. Most teams use plenty of biometric sensors on the drivers to measure pulse, blood pressure and even the amount of sweat emerging during turn behind the wheel. It’s not uncommon for a driver to lose up to seven pounds just from perspiration during his or her session. What’s New This Year? \nA number of car manufacturers have thrown their hat into the ring, but the most interesting announcement came from Cadillac. Its performance cars, the V-line, have done markedly well in other competitions, but this year, the racing division has got a brand new race bomb and it’s a stunner. (That’s it up there at the top of this page.) Also newsworthy is that Caddy coaxed NASCAR star Jeff Gordon out of retirement to drive the beauty. What Do I Need to Know About the Cars? \nCars in four classes will hit the banking for the twice round the clock journey. \nThe first, and fastest, class is the prototypes. These cars have undergone a huge shakeup in the off-season, with the Daytona Prototypes, which made their debut in 2003, finally being retired in favor of the DPi (Daytona Prototype International ) format. The DPi cars share chassis and suspensions with European prototype cars, called LMP2s (Le Mans Prototype ) but the DPis have more stylistic freedom, allowing the automakers to customize the bodywork to their specifications. Cadillac DPi-V.R \nThree Cadillac DPi-V.Rs will take part in Saturday’s race, at the hands of the Action Express and Wayne Taylor Racing teams. The Caddy boasts and 6.2-liter V-8 engine and a chassis designed by Dallara. All prototypes in competition must have a 6-speed transmission, but Cadillac teams have been having some teething issues with theirs. Either way, the stellar full-time line-ups in each of the three cars— including Gordon—along with the experience of the teams—combined, Action Express and Wayne Taylor have won the last 4 championships—will no doubt make the Cadillacs a threat. Nissan Onroak DPi \nReigning 24 champs, Tequila Patron ESM, are bringing the Nissan Onroak DPi stateside for the IMSA season. Patron President and CEO Ed Brown will be driving one of the two entries and has brought himself a stout lineup of co-drivers for the event. The Nissan is powered by a 3.8-liter V-6 twin-turbo adapted from, none other than, a Nissan GT-R. The screamin’ green ride will look to carve through the field like they did so expertly last year. IMSA Mazda RT24-P DPi \nAfter several near victories last season, Mazda prototypes are chasing the top step of the podium. This year’s entry, the RT24-P DPi, is a tip of the hat to Mazda’s “Road to 24” driver development program. The carmaker hopes its, relatively small, 2.0-liter, four-cylinder, turbocharged engine—through it cranks out nearly 600 horses—can bring the once dominant sportscar force back to front of the pack. GTLM [Grand Tour Le Mans] \nIMSA competition has two GT classes, one with all professional drivers—platinum and gold ranked—and the other with a pro-amateur line up. GT LeMans, or GTLM, is the all-pro version. The 11 cars in GTLM represent the best of the best offerings in each manufacturer’s stable. Corvette C7.R \nThe defending race winners, and series champions, took a commanding, and exciting first-second finish in 2016’s race. The two cars finished just 0.034 seconds apart, the closest finish in Daytona 24 history. The team returns with high hopes and a fast machine. The Pratt and Miller assisted Chevrolet entry churns out 491 horsepower from a 5.5-liter V-8 engine. It’s not only one of the quickest cars in the series, but one of the loudest as well. Porsche 911 RSR \nAfter dropping hints for several weeks, Porsche finally revealed their 2017 GT challenger, the 911 RSR, at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It’s the first 911 from the factory to sport a mid-engine, an arrangement closer to its Cayman cousin than 911 predecessors. Because of the engine placement, everything in the car was designed from scratch for better balance and to shed weight. Powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six engine that cranks up to 510 horsepower, this car may be exactly what Porsche needs to take the fight back to Corvette. IMSA Ford GT \nAfter a disappointing and occasionally fiery 2016 Rolex 24, Ford went on to an impressive first season back in GT racing after 50 years. With three victories in IMSA competition and a 24 Hours of Le Mans class win under their belts, Ford comes into the endurance race this year well prepared. Chip Ganassi Racing has four GTs in the race, each with a 3.5-liter V-6 EcoBoost engine pushing around 500 horses. GTD [Grand Tour Daytona] \nThe GT Daytona is one of the most competitive classes in IMSA racing. GTD, like GTLM, has a roster of recognizable car manufacturers, however the teams are typically customer endeavors, and not always factory backed. IMSA Lamborghini Huracan GT3 \nThe Lamborghini’s 5.2-liter V-10 engine pumps out an impressive 585 horsepower. However, in the balanced world of sportscar racing, that can actually have a disadvantage. The Lamborghinis are more restricted than other cars in the series, with added weight and smaller air intakes, and the cars faced a penalty last year when they purposefully sandbagged to get the restrictions lightened. For Lamborghini, this year is all about redemption and keeping their nose clean and putting those 585 ponies to their best use. Lexus RC F GT3 \nAfter several failed promises to get on the grid in 2016, Lexus has finally joined IMSA competition, and they’re bringing one of the most successful sportscar racers of all time, Scott Pruett, to boot. The race car, a wider, lower, lighter version of the RC F street car, is powered by a tuned version of the RC F’s V-8 engine, churning out 540 horsepower. Audi R8 LMS GT3 \nThree teams have chosen to run the R8 LMS GT3 in GTD for the Daytona 24, but the car should still be a threat during the race. One team in particular, Montaplast by Land-Motorsport took the R8 to multiple victories over in Europe before coming stateside. Backing them up will be a 585 horsepower 5.2-liter V-10. IMSA Mercedes-AMG GT3 \nMercedes eschewed turbocharging in favor of a naturally-aspirated 6.2-liter V-8 engine for their GT3 racing machine. Despite the restrictors mandated by the series, the beast still churns out 550 horses. Acura NSX GT3 \nOne of the most hotly anticipated cars, the new reimagined Acura NSX GT3, is finally hitting the track next week. The Michael Shank Racing team entering the cars won the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2012, and are looking for more success with their 3.5-liter, twin-turbo V-6 engine producing 500 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:52:53.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
