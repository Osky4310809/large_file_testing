ICYMI: \nWell, itâ€™s being reported in the British press that President Trump asked to hold Mayâ€™s hand because heâ€™s allegedly afraid of walking down stairs or ramps. From The Sunday Times: Times of London claims Trump has a phobia of \"slopes and stairs\" so he grabbed May's hand https://t.co/AL44beCd9V \nâ€” Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) January 29, 2017 Theresa May's staff is claiming the only reason she held Trump's hand is because he's afraid of stairs.
