Comey, the F.B.I. director. . @realDonaldTrump is right-Obama did spy on him as well as Merkel as we will see when the #deepstate cover- up crumbles. Comey next to LIE — Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) March 18, 2017 \n  Mr. Stone has said any contact he had with Russians represented only surface-level exchanges with no broader import. In 2016, Mr. Stone said at a public event that he had been in communication with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, and suggested they had a large collection of material to publish on Mrs. Clinton and her husband, Bill, in the weeks before Election Day. Mr. Stone later clarified that it was through an intermediary and, he said, “perfectly legal.” \n  In February 2016, the Smoking Gun website approached Mr. Stone about private messages exchanged on Twitter with Guccifer 2.0. Mr. Stone, who initially told the site that he did not recall the messages, later sent captured shots of the brief exchange to The Washington Times, describing them as “innocuous.” \n  He also pointed out that the messages were sent well after the hacked Democratic National Committee emails were made public. He would have “needed a time machine to have colluded,” he said. In an interview this week, CBS News asked Mr. Stone about 16 interactions with Guccifer 2.0, which Mr. Stone told The New York Times included public Twitter posts and private messages, and he maintained that they were all part of “exchanges,” as opposed to separate contacts. \n  He also maintained that he had “released the only exchanges” with Guccifer 2.0, saying the contacts were so “benign” that he had forgotten about them. He also does not fully accept American intelligence information indicating that Guccifer 2.0 is a front for Russian intelligence officers. “I had never heard allegations that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian asset until now, and am not certain it’s correct,” Mr. Stone said. He pointed out that he wrote a piece for Breitbart , a conservative website, on Aug. 5, nine days before the message exchange. “I’m just an available foil,” he said. \nGet politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .
