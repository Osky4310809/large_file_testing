By Jeffrey Matulef Published 24/01/2017 \nWith Resident Evil 7 launching today, series superfan and modder Rod Lima has reenvisioned the original adventure as a modern first-person affair in the following video: \nUsing the mansion and character models from the Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles on the Wii, Lima recreated the opening few rooms from Capcom's seminal survival horror affair with the camera planted firmly in Jill's eyeholes. \nIt doesn't look nearly as creepy as Resi 7, but that mostly comes down to the garish lighting. The actual cramped corridors still seem proper scary to be maneuvering around zombies in. Clearly Capcom was really onto something when it decided to opt for this new perspective. \nAs for Resident Evil 7, our contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found it enjoyable if not exactly groundbreaking. He summed up Capcom's sequel as \"a series of peekaboo jolts and serviceable gun battles strewn across a sumptuous, cohesive environment, constructed with no shortage of craft but not a whole lot of real imagination\" in his Resident Evil 7 review . \nFor more on Resident Evil, you can watch our Johnny Chiodini play it for the first time as Aoife Wilson relishes in his terror.
