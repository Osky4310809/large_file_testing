However, it looks like our luck might just be on the verge of turning around as the latest \"leaked\" photo seems to be from the actual movie and could be one of the most accurate things we've seen from the film to date.\nThe photo in question, which originated on Reddit , seemingly reveals our first look at Primetime Emmy-winner Bryan Cranston ( Breaking Bad ) as the Rangers' wise mentor/guardian Zordon overseeing what is presumably the Command Center and just like his television counterpart, he's once again a giant floating head. Alpha 5 also features in the bottom left corner standing in front of a console.\nThe photo's exact origin is uncertain, but it's said to be taken from the Power Rangers Movie virtual reality experience at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\nCheck out the photo below:\n Saban's Power Rangers follows five ordinary high school kids who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove – and the world – is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover that they are the only ones who can save the planet.
