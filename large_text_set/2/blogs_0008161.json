Van Gerwen admitted 'he's only human' after his weekend disappointment \nVan Gerwen, who came close to his third whitewash in the tournament's history, endured a disappointing weekend in the three UK Open Qualifiers in Wigan, and he told Sky Sports : \"Of course I had a bad week and everyone said 'what's wrong with him, is he sick?' But no, but I'm also human and things like that can happen to me.\" \nVictory helped MVG extend his unbeaten run on TV, which stretches back to September when he was beaten by Phil Taylor in the inaugural Champions League of Darts and Mardle was impressed with his thirst for more success. Michael is born entertainer, he's a born darts players, he's got it and he wants to carry on winning. Wayne Mardle on MVG \n\"I think he's a PR's dream, he wants to play well and we know that this sport is based around fans whether their sitting around watching or they're here,\" said former four-time participant, Mardle. \n\"Without the fans, the sport doesn't exist, it dies and fades away. Michael is born entertainer, he's a born darts players, he's got it and he wants to carry on winning. \n\"After that first leg which was really iffy from him especially, Peter Wright let him off the hook and should have, well, could have won 7-0, but Wright got three legs on the board. \n\"Like Michael said, to win 7-0 would have probably been unfair.\" Pleased with that win.

He's a clued up individual about what he's very good at and that's darts. Nothing is by chance, he's meticulous in his preparation.\" Watch how the drama unfolded on week two of Premier League Darts", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:09:31.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
