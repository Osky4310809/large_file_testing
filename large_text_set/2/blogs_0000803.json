Last Friday, as distributors shopped, producers hawked and a comedy called “Fun Mom Dinner” had its premiere, these six indie-film insiders showed us how they dressed for the white carpet. Image Credit Kim Raff for The New York Times Bridget Everett Occupation: Actor, comedian, cabaret performer You do not look dressed for the cold. No, but I’m trying to bring a little downtown New York to the festival. Me too. That’s where I live. Well, I live on the Upper West Side, but I’m a downtown New York performer, so I like to bring a little bit of that with me. Your top says Tampa Realness, Champagne Jerry. Tell me about this. Champagne Jerry is my friend, and he has a single called “ Tampa Realness .” I love Tampa and the song and him, so my friend made it into a tube top. And that’s a fanny pack? Yeah, it’s made by my friend, Larry Krone . He makes all my dresses for stage. This is one of my signature pieces. I wear it everywhere. It’s like my good luck charm. Image Credit Kim Raff for The New York Times Molly Shannon What are you wearing? Let’s start with the dress . Can you look? The tag is probably still on it. It’s Likely . I was here last week for “The Little Hours ” and this week for “Fun Mom Dinner.” As you can see I’ve been so busy I didn’t even take the tag off. This little piece keeping your shoulders warm, it’s as if you’re going to the opera. I think I just got it at a thrift shop. It really does keep me warm, and it makes me feel like an elegant lady out in Park City doing business, on a Friday afternoon.

It’s Rag & Bone. I wear this a lot, this jacket. It’s just a deconstructed, all-purpose sports coat. You like a white oxford for a premiere? I like it for everything. Are you loyal to a particular denim brand? These are Simon Miller, and I’ve found I really like the jeans that he makes. He actually no longer makes Simon Miller jeans. I know. And these shoes are just Blundstones. Your giant belt buckle says “Kansas.” Where did you get it? In Santa Fe. It’s just silly. Image Credit Kim Raff for The New York Times Toni Collette Are you wearing a pussy bow? I am. I’m pussy bow-ing it up right now. Where’s your blazer from? Max Mara actually. And the blouse? It’s a good one. I spent money on it. They were calling me a scientist earlier. It might be Chloé. And what about your jeans? I actually wore these in the movie. You stole them from wardrobe? Yes! Your clutch is heavy on the leopard print. It’s Clare V. I have like 95 of her bags. I love them. Image Credit Kim Raff for The New York Times David Henry Gerson Occupation : Actor, director, producer Those are great boots I got these to play Stanley Kowalski in a tiny production of “A Streetcar Named Desire” on Third Street, between Avenues C and D, in the People’s Garden. Tell me about your jacket. It’s also from New York, from a shop — I don’t know if it exists any more — called Teddy Boy. It has a nice big collar and a pocket to keep all my business cards in. Are you doing lots of business here? Yes, I have two films here: Automatic at Sea , which played at Slamdance and a shortcalled All These Voices . Where are your jeans from? Uniqlo. I buy tons of the exact same pair and wear them until they get holes in them. Image Credit Kim Raff for The New York Times Krysta Brown Occupation: Student, intern at William Morris Endeavor You’re an intern at WME. Does that mean you work in the mail room? It does. Your camel coat is nice and long. I love this color and I love the length of this coat because I’m tall and I like wearing heels and boots with longer coats and sweaters. Those are dope sunglasses. I got these off the Wish app. It’s an app where you get cheap stuff from overseas. I got them for $3. Your socks are sticking out of your boots. Is that for style or warmth? Both. It’s from Sundance. They were having a workshop and giving away free beanies. Image Credit Kim Raff for The New York Times Adam Scott (with his wife, Naomi Scott, producer of “Fun Mom Dinner) Age : 43 Let’s talk about your outfit. I did not spend much time on mine. How about your corduroy blazer? This is Band of Outsiders, may they rest in peace. It’s so sad. Now I go in eBay to find Band of Outsiders. Me too. We probably compete. You probably have an edge, being a movie star. I don’t know. I’ve lost some really nice pieces. There are patches on the elbows. Are you feeling professorial? Always. There’s never a day when I don’t feel professorial. Paul Rudd has the same thing. We got ready and walked out to the living room and both saw elbow patches and were like, “Oh, good lord. What’s wrong with us?” Image Credit Kim Raff for The New York Times Andrew Duncan Occupation: Producer, chairman of June Pictures What movies are you here with? One is called “ Joshua: Teenager Versus Superpower ,” about him taking on Beijing. The second is “ Thoroughbred ,” tragically Anton Yelchin’s final film. The third is “ Fun Mom Dinner .” Let’s talk about your crazy shoes. They’re Louis Vuitton. I saw the spikes. I’ve been working on the liberation of a woman named Sandy Phan-Gillis who is a U.S. citizen who’s been held hostage by Beijing, and subjected to torture and has been seated on a seat with spikes like this. I do this to remind me of the Chinese dissidents who don’t have freedom of speech or process of law. Well this is going to be a weird transition, but are those dad jeans or cool jeans? These are cool jeans. They’re from Bergdorf Goodman in New York.
