You'd be lying (kind of) if these nine situations didn't make you want to almost consider breaking up with her. 1. When you both end up buying the same outfit with promises of never wearing it together, and then she turns up in the exact same outfit that you told her (multiple times) you'd be wearing that day. ARGH!! 2. When you are out of town and you ping her to hear about how much she missed you, only to instead be sent pictures of how much fun she's having without you.3. When she is out of town and you send a \"Hi\", and are about to type a long rant about how much you miss her only to get 17 pictures of her having fun with her new found best friend!! 4. When she bonds with the new person in the group before anyone else does. In fact when you mentioned that you weren't too happy with this new person she laughed and rolled her eyes!!5. When she cancels plans with you because she has to meet her boyfriend. Come on girl, don't you know it's always Sisters before Misters?6. When she meets anyone who is not you, and comes back to you with stories of how much fun she's having with her \"new\" friend.7. When she makes plans and assumes that you will be on board. Yes you will be, but sometimes getting some importance from her would be good too.8. When she insults you in front of a third person. You insult each other all the time, but the equation completely changes with this third person in the picture.9. When she tells you she doesn't have enough friends... WHAT IS EVEN HAPPENING????
