After both Warcraft and Assassin’s Creed – two films that had more promise than perhaps any video game adaptations ever – were met with disappointing results, it seems to be just as hard to make the transition from gaming to the silver screen as it has ever been, even with more and more talented filmmakers coming onboard different projects to try and bring popular titles to life.\nStill, Hollywood’s goals of making a successful video game franchise into an equally successful film franchise continue on, and one of the most interesting and exciting in development right now is without a doubt, Warner Bros.’ Tomb Raider reboot. With Academy Award-winner Alicia Vikander set to lead the film as Lara Croft, it’s assembled an interesting and talented group of actors for itself so far.\nIn an unexpected piece of casting news today as well, Variety is reporting that Into the Badlands star Daniel Wu has just joined the cast of the Tomb Raider reboot. Wu will reportedly play a character named Lu Ren, a ship captain who partners with Vikander’s Croft on a mission to find her father . The film will be directed by Norwegian filmmaker Roar Uthaug, from a screenplay written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet, the screenwriter also attached to a number of upcoming blockbuster films, including Sherlock Holmes 3 and Gotham City Sirens .\nIn addition to Vikander, Wu joins the recently cast Walton Goggins ( The Hateful Eight, Justified ) in the reboot, with the latter set to play the film’s mysterious villain . No other cast members have been announced as of yet, but with an early spring release date already set for next year, and production reportedly beginning this month , fans can expect some more casting updates and additions to be revealed sometime in the near future (hopefully, at least).\nNotably, this is also Wu’s second video game adaptation after his work in last year’s Warcraft , where he played the villainous orc known as Gul’dan. He also stars as Sunny in AMC’s Into the Badlands , which is expected to return with its second season this spring on the network. No other details about his character in the Tomb Raider reboot have been revealed yet – but based on Wu’s talents with martial arts and experience (having pulled off some fairly technical stunts in the past), one assumes his Lu Ren will be more than just a ship captain. Either way, he’s yet another exciting addition to what is quickly becoming a powerhouse ensemble for this reboot, which isn’t too bad considering how the previous live-action, Angelina Jolie-led Tomb Raider films ended up turning out.\nSource: Variety", "external_links": ["http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-director-writer.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-director-writer.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-director-writer.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://variety.com/2017/film/news/tomb-raider-reboot-daniel-wu-1201958245/", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-director-writer.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-director-writer.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1200&h=600&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-director-writer.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-director-writer.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant2.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-director-writer.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-11T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:07:07.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
