Who’s the Christian Grey of cheap greasy meat? Well the obvious, correct answer is late-night moon man crooner Mac Tonight , but he hasn’t been seen in ages. Sexy Hamburglar was a strong contender but he vanished nearly as fast as he arrived. KFC’s parade of Colonel Sanders actors, from Norm Macdonald to Vincent Kartheiser, just keep getting hotter than spicy Nashville chicken by the day. But the best icon of surreal sensuality of among burger slingers just might be the Burger King and his creepy unending smile.\nWhile we can meaningfully debate until the end of time which fast food mascot is the best at boning, Burger King will soon be the definitive answer to which fast food meal will make the most babies. This Valentine’s Day, Burger King Israel is selling not Kid’s Meals but Adult Meals with “age-appropriate” toys inside. Finally, you can buy sex toys at a Burger King!\nThe Burger King Adults Meal comes with two Whoppers (heh) and two serving of french fries, perfect for couples to share. The two include beers are the first sign this dinner is for adults only. But the biggest clue is the complementary sex toy. There aren’t many details as to what these toys might be, but the trailer offers some hints. Besides, we don’t want to spoil the mystery and ruin the mood.\nConsenting adults aged 18 and older can only buy the Burger King Adult Meal after 6 P.M. this Valentine’s Day. Unfortunately, it looks like it’s only available in Israel. Hopefully it’s a success and Burger King makes the Adults Meal a permanent part of its menu. Last time I checked, lots of people like having sex any day of the week any time in every part of the world. As far as fast food gimmicks go, a box full of Burger King food and sex toys is way more appealing than a pizza made of fried chicken or a Big Mac cut into sushi , unless you’re into that sort of thing. Not that there’s anything wrong with that.\nSex!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:23:02.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
