The pressure of making a good first impression is terrifying, but it can also be the defining moment in your relationship. And to couples who have been together well past their first dates, we're sure the occasion holds an even more important place in their hearts. We asked a few parents (our own, and others) about their first dates, and here's what they had to say. (P.S. Your heart may not be able to take the cuteness.) \n\"For our first date, we went to get orange bars (ice cream sticks) with our friends. And to this day, we're still obsessed with orange bars!\" \n-Arti and Rajiv \n\"We were supposed to meet under the big clock at Churchgate station, at 8 - no am or pm specified. Being over-enthusiastic as I was, I landed up there in the morning, at 8. After waiting for a couple of hours, I went over to her local guardian's house, because that was the only information I had, but she was out. So I waited till she was back, changed, and then we finally went on our date that evening.\" \n-Shoeb and Nilufer \n\"I had just come from Lansdowne to Delhi for the first time, and he already lived here. We met at the park, and the rest is history.\" \n-Manju and Ramesh \n\"We ate chicken lollipops and Chinese food at Chopsticks 2 on our first date, and both got food poisoning right after. But still in love and married, after all these years.\" \n-Vir and Amrita \n\"Since we had an arranged marriage, we never really dated. But now that our kids are all grown up, we make it a point to go on dates as often as we can! Whether it's for a drive in the rain, or a weekend trip to our house in Kasauli.\" \n-Manjeet and Preet \n\"I still remember the date - 18th April, 1976. We went for coffee and a boat ride in the lake, followed by a long walk. I had to be home by dark though, since I was just 19 and he was 21. Later that night, he came outside my house and sang Khoya Khoya Chand for me, and I took my mother out for a walk, just so I could see him. And then him singing to me outside my house became a nightly tradition.\" \n-Babli and Om", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:40:16.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
