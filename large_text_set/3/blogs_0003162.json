Photo: Killian Bell/Cult of Mac \nIf you were awake at all this weekend, you’ll know Nintendo has finally launched its much-anticipated Switch console. One feature you probably didn’t know about is the ability to use its unique Joy-Con controllers to play games on your Mac. \nIn many ways, Switch marks a big change in direction for Nintendo. The Japanese firm, which has previously pushed proprietary ports and locked down its consoles as much as possible, has done away with region locking and adopted USB-C for charging and connectivity. \nLike the PlayStation 4’s DualShock, Switch Joy-Con controllers are connected using Bluetooth, which means they can also talk to other Bluetooth devices. Hook them up to your Mac, Windows PC, or Android-powered device and you can use them to play your favorite games. Wow, bonus Nintendo Switch feature I wasn't expecting: JoyCons easily double as OSX bluetooth controllers pic.twitter.com/3K99S1AAuF \n— Sam Williams (@stimply) March 5, 2017 \nThe Joy-Cons can be used separately for simpler games that require just one analog stick. However, you can pair both and use them simultaneously if you want to take advantage of two sticks and all the buttons. \nPairing is as simple as connecting any other Bluetooth gamepad; simply find the Joy-Cons under the Bluetooth menu in System Preferences. On Android and macOS, they’ll work right out of the box, but you’ll need an app like JoyToKey to map the controls on Windows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T16:41:07.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
