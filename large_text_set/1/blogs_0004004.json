Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover that they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so they will have to overcome their real-life issues and band together as the Power Rangers before it is too late. \nThe Power Rangers cast includes Dacre Montgomery ( A Few Less Men ) as Jason the Red Ranger, RJ Cyler ( Me and Earl and the Dying Girl ) as Billy the Blue Ranger, Naomi Scott ( The 33 ) as Kimberly the Pink Ranger, Becky G ( Empire ) as Trini the Yellow Ranger, Ludi Lin ( Monster Hunt ) as Zack the Black Ranger, with Bill Hader (“Saturday Night Live) voicing Alpha 5, Bryan Cranston (“Breaking Bad,” Godzilla ) as Zordon, and Elizabeth Banks as villain Rita Repulsa. \nDirected by Dean Israelite ( Project Almanac ), Power Rangers is written by John Gatins ( Kong: Skull Island , Real Steel ), Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama ( Dracula Untold ), Zack Stentz and Ashley Miller ( X-Men: First Class , Thor ), and Max Landis ( Chronicle ).
