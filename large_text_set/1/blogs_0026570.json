While Lyon spoke candidly about his own personal struggles during the interview, he often became defensive when pressed on matters that involved other parties. \n“Do you understand why I find that a hard question from you?” Lyon said. “I expect that from the front part of the paper. \n“Who cares? You care whether we go out for dinner?” Lyon is back on the airwaves. Source: News Corp Australia \nLyon, a fiercely private person, said he finds it “embarrassing” and “hates it” that his social life and what he does in his own time has become a point of interest for the media. \nPressed on whether he would have handled the situation in late 2015 better, when news of his relationship with Nicky Brownless became public, Lyon said that question was based on the assumption he hadn’t tried to talk to his good friend about the development. \n“You’re assuming we didn’t talk to him,” Lyon said. “But that’s for Bill and I and Nicky. \n“There’s no easy way to broach that subject and I’m not saying I was jumping out of my skin to talk to Bill about it. \n“If you could do things differently, in hindsight, maybe. I know there’s a lot of hurt as a result of that and I’ve got to carry that.” \nThe former Melbourne Demons captain said he texted Brownless before news of the relationship became public, but Brownless never responded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:32:03.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
