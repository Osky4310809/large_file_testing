Sean Rayford, Getty Images \nI've been getting the impression for some time now that Donald Trump really, really doesn't like the media. \nThis is odd, as he's always seemed to enjoy appearing on TV and in the press. He's also said to watch cable news and read east coast papers with considerable commitment. \nStill, having accused CNN of being so-called \"fake news\" at Thursday's solo press conference, you'd think his feelings were crystal clear. \nYet no. On Friday, he was compelled to tweet something even more specific : \"The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\" \nThat does seem a touch harsh. Leaving out The Washington Post, I mean. He has directed his ire at that publication previously. Does this mean it's \"improved\" in some way? \nOn Twitter, though, some focused on the term \"enemy of the people.\" They felt it touched on the notion that the media was somehow traitorous and that the First Amendment may not be all that. \nThis, for example, from David Cicilline : \"This is usually one of the first things authoritarian leaders do. Attack the media's credibility.\" \n\"Vilify media: check. Discredit intelligence: check. Establish dictatorship: still working on it,\" suggested Twitter user Gilskee. \nPresidential historian Michael Beschloss offered an echo of times past : \"On December 1972 tape, Nixon told Kissinger, 'The press is the enemy, the establishment is the enemy, the professors are the enemy.'
