A man wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat – a souvenir direct from President Donald Trump’s election campaign – said that Trudeau was either “a liar or confused.” \n“You’re in Alberta now, sir. You’re not in Ottawa,” he shouted. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to the media at the end of a two-day cabinet retreat in Calgary, Alberta, Canada January 24, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Bolin - RTSX74S \nEarlier, Trudeau reversed himself on his oil sands policy – the oil rich patch of land in Alberta that has become an ideological war zone between energy security advocates and environmental activists. Trudeau now says he “misspoke” when he told an Ontario town hall that the oil sands will be “phased-out.” \n“I misspoke. I said something the way I shouldn’t have said it,” Trudeau said after emerging from a two-day cabinet retreat in downtown Calgary, where Trudeau received the welcome news that the U.S. has approved the Keystone XL pipeline, a key to reviving Canada’s energy sector that has been depressed by low oil prices and lack of access to oil refineries. \nThat remark enraged political and business leaders in Western Canada at the time and last night’s recalibration angered many at the town as Trudeau’s questioner continued, “When you come to Calgary, you tell people you’re sorry. You are either a liar or you’re confused. And I’m beginning to think it’s both.” \nMost of the 1,700 people cheered at the accusation. \nInstead of acknowledging any ambiguity in his energy policy, Trudeau claimed absolute consistency, suggesting that he could promote oil pipelines concurrent with controversial climate change legislation. “I have repeatedly said that yes, the responsibility of any Canadian prime minister is to get our resources to market and yes, that includes our oil sands fossil fuels,” he said. \n“I’ve also said that we need to do that in a responsible, sustainable way — that you cannot separate what’s good for the environment and what’s good for the economy.” \nTrudeau claimed that his Conservative predecessor, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, would agree on the eventual obsolescence of fossil fuels. \nFollow David on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T18:20:01.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
