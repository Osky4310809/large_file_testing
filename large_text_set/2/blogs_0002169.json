Hrithik Roshan just announced that he wants to celebrate the success of his movie, Kaabil , with his fans. In an elaborate video that he posted on social media, the actor explained how his fans could be a part of the success bash. All you need to do is watch the film on February 3 or later, and post a picture of yourself with your Kaabil ticket, tagging the actor, of course! \nA total of 500 fans would be a part of this celebration where not just Hrithik but a lot others from the industry would be present. Now that is a once in a lifetime opportunity, right? BRB, going to participate. It's done! Thank u kaabil team for making my idea happen!!! #celebrateKaabil pic.twitter.com/jO0lGSZGJ4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T12:32:52.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
