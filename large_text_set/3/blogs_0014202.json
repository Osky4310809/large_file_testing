Forget it. Tobacco? No way. Goldman Sachs? Are you kidding? Oil companies? You must be joking. Pipeline companies? Never.\" \nVarney said that other industries - such as alcohol and cannabis - never have to worry about being targeted in Berkeley. \n\"I think the left is trying to make the country ungovernable,\" Varney said. \"Whether it's students on campus, Democrats in Congress, protesters on the streets or unelected judges in the courts, the aim is the same: Stop Trump from doing anything.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T10:59:07.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
