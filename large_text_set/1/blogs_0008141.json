More than a quarter (26%) of the 3,449 currently employed people in the study said they plan to retire before they turn 65. Those who said they plan to retire early were no more likely to describe their family growing up as “wealthy/affluent” or “financially comfortable” than people who planned to stay in the workforce longer. (For more, see: Can Retirement Damage Your Health? ) How Early Retirees Are Similar \nThe study found that those readying themselves for early retirement display the following common traits: \nSharing good habits. Their life partner features a similar approach to how they tackle their own finances, which is described as practical when compared to those who don't plan on retiring. \nStaying married. Those who plan to retire early are more likely to be married — 76% vs. 68% who never plan to retire — and are still in their first marriage (77% vs. 70% of those who never plan to retire). \nSeeking a benchmark. They use their parent’s financial status as a benchmark to track how they are doing financially (21% versus 14% of those who never plan to retire). \nWilling talkers. They are more likely to find it somewhat easy to talk about finances with their families They have also done more to teach their children about money, including encouraging them to work with a financial professional (14% versus 6% of those who never plan to retire).

Those who expect to retire early are worried about other things, namely about dying young (53%) compared with outliving their money in retirement (47%).
