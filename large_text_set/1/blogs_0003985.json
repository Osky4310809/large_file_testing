Chelsea are no longer so far away in the distance.

They are no longer in cruise control and it’s a test of their mental strength. \nEven Conte looked subdued during the game at White Hart Lane, his touchline histrionics were more low key than usual. \nThere was less screaming and shouting, less drama and at the end he simply embraced Mauricio Pochettino, a moment of respect having been beaten at last.

Tottenham's players celebrate (Photo: Chelsea Football Club) \nChelsea looked a bit flat, especially going forward. Moussa Dembele won the midfield battle with N’Golo Kante and Eden Hazard missed Chelsea’s best two chances. \nThere was even some comedy gold with Diego Costa’s spat with Pedro after a misplaced through ball sparked a row between the pair in the first half.

But when that sort of run is finally ended, it’s vital to win the next one and make sure a blip doesn't turn into anything more worrying. \nConte has been superb at whipping up his players when the going has been good. But now is where he will face a test to keep Chelsea firmly on the title trail. poll loading Will Chelsea win the title this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:13:45.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
