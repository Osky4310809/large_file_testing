The company has faced several consumer lawsuits claiming that it deliberately tampers with or fails to vet list prices.\nAmazon may have decided the practice is more of a headache than it's worth. The New York Times reported last summer that the shopping site has been quietly phasing out list prices altogether, marking a dramatic shift for a retailer that staked its early reputation on advertising big savings.\nBONUS: Amazon just made its first legit delivery via drone", "external_links": ["https://www.truthinadvertising.org/amazon-coms-list-price/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/04/business/amazon-is-quietly-eliminating-list-prices.html", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/ZkFCtA1D.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/ZkFCtA1D.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-12T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T05:15:06.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
