Let us explain. \nAs reported by the Liverpool Echo , Fowler and his Reds team-mates - including Steven Gerrard - are gearing up for a legends match against Real Madrid at Anfield this weekend, and it has been cause enough for a remarkable story from the former goal-getter's past to get another airing. A Real Madrid title-winner, apparently (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \nIt all starts with Fowler going to visit his old Liverpool mate Steve McManaman in Madrid at the tail end of the 2002/03 season, when his Real team beat Athletic Bilbao 3-1 at Bernabeu to secure the league title. We'll let him take it from there. \n\"It was absolutely mental to be honest,” Fowler said. \n“Steve McManaman is a massive mate of mine but with my playing commitments I hadn’t been able to visit him. I was on holiday in Portugal with a family member at that time so we made plans to go over there. \"El Macca\" won two league titles and two Champions Leagues at Real Madrid (Photo: Getty) \n“Madrid ended up winning but the night was much more memorable than the game. I was in the lounge afterwards when Macca walks in with two Real Madrid T-shirts and says to us: ‘Put them on, you’re coming on the bus.’ \n“So Real Madrid are celebrating and doing their tour of the city on their bus with hundreds of thousands fans lining the streets and there’s myself and my cousin – two little scallywags from Toxteth - with them going up to the fountain in the middle of Madrid. The atmosphere was amazing. It doesn’t get any better than that.” \n“I think the Real lads knew who I was but my cousin got a few dodgy looks! It was fantastic,” he added. This wasn't THAT team bus, but you get the picture (Photo: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez) \n“When they got to the fountain, the players got off and did a little tour around it. I was asked to go and do that with them but I stopped short of that. \n“I think that would have been too much. One of my abiding memories was being on the bus and for as far as you could see there were Real Madrid supporters. Fowler \"eating the grass\" back in his Liverpool days (Photo: Getty) \n“When the bus stopped, I was cowered down a little bit as I was bit embarrassed about being there. But there were about 20 English lads who spotted me and started singing my name. \n“Real Madrid have just won the league, their players are around the fountain, celebrating the title, and you can hear these lads chanting ‘Fowler, Fowler’. It was a great night. It was surreal actually.” \nIt certainly sounds it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:12:49.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
