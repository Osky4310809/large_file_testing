While there were poor performances along the way, Klopp's first 15 months saw a steady improvement in the side. \nThe past two, however, have born witness to a collapse. Liverpool have won just two of their 12 games in 2017 and have gone from Chelsea's main title challengers to 14 points off the top of the table. \nTwice this month they have faced sides in the relegation zone and lost. On top of that they took 180 minutes to beat League Two Plymouth in the FA Cup and were then dumped out by Championship side Wolves in the next round.

Monday's 3-1 defeat away to struggling Leicester was the lowest point of Klopp's reign, but the slide has not yet been arrested. \nThey face Arsenal, who are a point ahead of them with a game in hand, this weekend in an encounter that could easily end in a heavy defeat. \nSpeaking after Liverpool's latest horror show, Klopp admitted: “It's getting more serious now. We all play for our futures, myself included.\" \nKlopp is great coach and a charismatic guy, but he is right when he says his future is not certain.
