The manufacturer, Timecode Systems, announced SyncBac Pro at NAB 2016. However, the product did not start shipping until late last year. \nThis should make post-production much more efficient, eliminating much of the labor of synchronizing multiple streams of non-time coded footage. \nThe device simply clips into the HERO Bus 30 pin port on the rear of the camera, both attaching it to the camera and eliminating the need for external connectors. It is fully compatible with all standard GoPro BacPac backdoor housings. Its internal battery lasts 12 hours, and it operates over the long range 865 to 923MHz frequency band. \nTimecode can be generated using either Timecode Systems :pulse, :wave, or Mini TRx timecode generators/metadata hubs. All connected devices can then be integrated into Timecode Systems' production workflow via the wireless timecode and metadata monitoring and control application, B:LINK Hub. The B:LINK Hub application allows you to control and monitor all of the cameras that are synced on the system from one interface. This includes: starting/stopping, putting cameras to sleep, monitoring media and battery life, and changing all camera settings, such as frame rate and white balance. \nIn addition to integrating GoPro cameras into a standard video professional production workflow, the device may be particularly useful in VR/360 video production. Timecode Systems will be making new announcements this year at NAB regarding the company's focus on VR/360 workflows. Their goal is to view, control, and monitor each camera in a spherical array of multiple GoPro cameras, individually, from one interface. This should make VR production—and, more importantly, post-production—much more efficient, eliminating much of the labor of synchronizing multiple streams of non-time coded footage. \nEach SyncBac Pro unit retails at $269 , which could be pretty pricey on a large array. Do you have any insights as to how to deal with timecode and camera control issues in VR production cheaply?
