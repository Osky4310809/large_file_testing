IC war going to new levels,” Schindler wrote. “Just got an EM fm senior IC friend, it began: ‘He will die in jail.'” Now we go nuclear. IC war going to new levels. Just got an EM fm senior IC friend, it began: “He will die in jail.” https://t.co/e6FxCclVqT \n— John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 \nOne of Trump’s tweets Wednesday that may have drawn the ire of the intelligence community accused national security officials of being “un-American.” The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by “intelligence” like candy. Very un-American! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 \nAnother tweet made specific mention of the New York Times and the Washington Post, two news outlets who have received numerous leaks from anonymous U.S. officials. Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 \nTrump’s tweets followed both the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn and new leaks alleging repeated contact between Russian intelligence and the Trump campaign. \n“This is absurd,” Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, told the New York Times Tuesday. “I have no idea what this is referring to. I have never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers, and I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation today.” \n“It’s not like these people wear badges that say, ‘I’m a Russian intelligence officer.’” \nThe Times report concluded that officials had seen “no evidence” of cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence.
