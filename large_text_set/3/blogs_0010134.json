Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nStunned Bournemouth chiefs are furious after Marcos Rojo escaped an FA charge for his alleged stamp on Eden Hazard. \nIt comes less than a week after Cherries defender Tyrone Mings received a five-game ban for a similar incident in which he was judged to have stamped on the head of Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \nBournemouth sources fear they are the victims of a big-club bias , with widespread disbelief greeting the controversial verdict. \nIbrahimovic was also given only a three-match ban last week for what seemed a clear retaliatory elbow into Mings’ head. United defender Rojo proclaims his innocence to referee Oliver (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nTV pictures show Rojo treading on Chelsea forward Hazard during Monday night's FA Cup tie looked far more clear-cut than the Mings incident, which was the subject of huge debate. \nBournemouth sources believe it is “crazy” that their player was punished when his guilt could not conclusively be proven. \nYet, incredibly, Old Trafford counterpart Rojo got off scot-free, as match referee Michael Oliver insisted he saw what the Argentinean had done and did not deem it worthy of a red card at the time. \nFootball Association chiefs insist they cannot “re-referee” games afterwards, as they believe that would open the floodgates and would undermine officials in future. There is anger at Bournemouth over Mings' ban when there is no proof he meant to tread on Zlatan (Photo: Man Utd/Getty) \nOliver has no opportunity to review the decision and former Premier League referee Mark Halsey insisted the FA have got it wrong. \nHalsey said: “Bournemouth’s Tyrone Mings got a five-game ban and the FA must be consistent. Rojo is so lucky he didn’t get a red.” \nBournemouth declined to comment on Tuesday night. \nUnited have also been charged with failing to control their players after a clutch of them surrounded Oliver following his decision to send off their midfielder Ander Herrera in what was a bad-tempered game. \nThey have until 6pm on Friday to appeal, but if they accept the charge they are likely to be given just a £20,000 fine.
