Not a bad trade.\nThe Displayport caps out at 30 hz when outputting at 4K, but besides that no other ports are compromised. For what it's worth, I run my 4K display at a resolution of 2560 x 1600, which this hub can run at 60 hz.\nWe live in a wireless world, but MacBook Pro owners (myself included) tend to have a lot of different peripherals and accessories running around. If you want to connect an external hard drive, external display , and have a wired internet connection, you'll need a dock like this.\nBetter still, since the ports on the dock are standard, you won't have to worry about having to buy all new accessories. If you're picking up one of Apple's newly announced MacBook Pros, a hub is a worthwhile companion. I've used one for a year, and regardless of which computer I buy next, I'll have to have one.\nCalDigit USB-C Docking Station, $149.99, available at Amazon\nThis article was originally published on 10/27/2016.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
