The manager wanted to build the team around Dimitri but, sadly, sometimes it becomes impossible. \n\"You do everything you can and then you suddenly realise 'this isn't going to work' and you bite the bullet. \n\"He's let the fans down, he's let the football club down and I'm hugely disappointed.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:17:30.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
