Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ID: 10394515 Earlier this week, the president again falsely claimed during a meeting with congressional leaders that votes from millions of unauthorized immigrants had cost him the popular vote.\nBut as recently as Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer initially told reporters that the administration had no plans to investigate the supposed conspiracy because Trump was “comfortable” with his victory.\n“He’s very comfortable with the depth and breadth of the support he got from the American people,” Spicer said Tuesday.\n“If 3-5 million people voted illegally that is a scandal of astronomical proportions,” a reporter asked. “Doesn’t he want to restore Americans’ faith in their ballot system? Wouldn’t he want an investigation into this?”\n“We’ll see where we go,” Spicer replied, “but right now the focus that the president has is putting Americans back to work. [His remarks to congressional leaders were] a comment that he made on a long standing belief.”\nTrump’s false allegations of widespread voter fraud date back months.\nIn November he tweeted that in addition to “winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally”.\nResponding to Trump’s Wednesday tweets, Ohio’s secretary of state, Jon Husted, a Republican, said it was “hard to cheat” at the ballot box.\nWe conducted a review 4 years ago in Ohio & already have a statewide review of 2016 election underway.

Lindsey Graham urged the president on Tuesday. “People are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system.”\nA number of Democrats said Tuesday they could support an investigation into voter fraud – purely to debunk the Trump administration’s claims.\n“They’re making these allegations, but we’re going to the attorney generals and saying, is there voter fraud, and what proof is there?” Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, told BuzzFeed News .\nDemocrats Say They Could Get Behind A Voter Fraud Investigation — To Prove Trump Wrong", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/824240344980226052", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/824235302940188672", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://fox40.com/2017/01/24/lindsey-graham-blasts-trump-after-latest-voter-fraud-claim/", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/824227824903090176", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/824228768227217408", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/donald-trump-congress-democrats.html?_r=2", "https://t.co/JXhlDgkA8I"], "published": "2017-01-25T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T16:32:10.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
