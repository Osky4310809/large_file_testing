The proportion was even greater (76%) among the non-UK EU citizens in the survey, commissioned by the University and College Union, which represents tens of thousands of academics and is based in London. \nMany individual foreign researchers have said they feel less welcome in Britain after the Brexit vote, or that they now see better opportunities abroad. But the latest poll is one of the clearest indications of the widespread nature of this feeling in UK academia.

More than half of academics think that the proposal to merge the nine UK research funding agencies into one body—currently being debated in Parliament—will have a negative impact. Just 9% think it would be a positive move. Even greater proportions think that there will be negative impacts from other changes, such as plans to make it easier for new universities to be set up. \n“The level of concern amongst staff about the bill’s plans must be cause for alarm,” said Sally Hunt, the union’s general secretary, in a statement. “The government must focus its full attention on dealing with the impacts of Brexit and shelve the divisive HE bill.” \nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on January 9, 2016.
