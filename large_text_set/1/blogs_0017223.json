The only reason I’ll be reaching across the aisle is to grab one of them by the throat.” \nAccording to Business Insider , when asked about his comments, the Democratic law enforcement official said that Democrats have done “nothing for black people and I’m tired of that.” \nClarke was recently in the news over an encounter he had with a man on an airplane. Reportedly, Clarke detained the man at an airport for a short while after he shook his head at Clarke for wearing Dallas Cowboys gear. The sheriff responded to the man’s complaint by threatening to take physical action next time. \nA large group of protesters gathered outside the Deploraball last night to demonstrate against the event. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:55:38.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
