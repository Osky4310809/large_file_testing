The high school sweethearts dated for three-and-a-half years before they decided in college to end their relationship.\nBach, who has a tripod, was the mastermind behind the photoshoot, and his ex was game.\n“I see my friends who are in relationships doing really nice professional photography photoshoots,” he said. “I had the idea of doing the same thing in the same setting, but post-relationship, in a different way.”\nHe shared the photos on Facebook, and then one of his friends posted them to Twitter , where they quickly achieved meme status.\n“When your girlfriend comes back from war but she’s not the same,” said one Twitter user mocking the dramatic photos.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:25:36.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
