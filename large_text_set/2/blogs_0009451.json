Rodriguez/Getty Images \nParis Jackson is just like many of us...when it comes to Beyoncé , that is. \nThe 18-year-old daughter of the late Michael Jackson was in grade school when she made her Grammys debut in 2010, when she and her older brother Prince Michael accepted a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of their father. They attended the show with their little brother Blanket . \n\"I was really nervous and I made eye contact with Beyoncé who was like in the first row and I like almost peed myself, I was so excited and then I like couldn't think of what to say,\" she told E! News' Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet at the 2017 Grammys Sunday. \"But that was like my main focus.\" Photos \nGrammys 2017 Red Carpet Arrivals Kevin Mazur/WireImage \nWill history repeat itself during Sunday's show? Paris is presenting an award, while Beyoncé, who is nominated for nine Grammys, will sit in the front row once again. \nDuring her interview with Seacrest, Paris also talked about her upcoming acting debut. She appears in the new Fox series Star , which is set to premiere later this year. \n\"I'm very excited about it,\" she said. \"The cast was amazing to work. The director and writers, they're all fantastic.\" \nParis walked the 2017 Grammys red carpet in a multicolored Balmain gown. Check out more photos of celebs arriving at the show .
