However, when I stop and think about Peter Capaldi’s run as a whole, I really, really enjoyed both his take on the Doctor as well as many of his stories. Sadly, Capaldi officially announced that the upcoming series of Doctor Who will be his last. \nAs reported by The Nerdy Bird , in addition to the above statement, Capaldi was also quick to remind Whovians that there’s still a whole Series 10 coming in April, complete with the introduction of Bill as the Doctor’s new companion. “I’m still #DoctorWho!” he tweeted. “We’re doing epic stuff! I’m not done yet!” Peter confirms he’ll be stepping down in Xmas 2017, but“I’m still #DoctorWho ! We’re doing epic stuff! I’m not done yet!” \n— Doctor Who Official (@bbcdoctorwho) January 30, 2017 \nI’m really sorry to hear this, as Capaldi’s an awesome actor, and he’s brought both a gravitas and a surprising, quirky gentleness to the Doctor during his time on the show. Not only that, but his relationship with Clara was about a billion times more fascinating than her relationship with Eleven, and Twelve + Ashildr = AWESOMENESS. \nHowever, while I was curious to see how Capaldi would fare with stories from a different showrunner, it’s understandable that the BBC and/or incoming showrunner Chris Chibnall would want to start with a clean slate and a new Doctor. \nWhat do you think? Are you excited for Series 10 of Doctor Who in April? Will you be sorry to see Capaldi go?
