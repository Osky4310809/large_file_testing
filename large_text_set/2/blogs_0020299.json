And why not? Even the most expensive homes and plots of real estate pale in comparison with the wealth of a man like Buffett. That's why it may come as such a surprise to follower's of the \" Oracle of Omaha \" that Buffett is planning to sell off his California beach home; he has owned the home for more than 45 years.

He is now planning to put it on the market for a rumored $11 million. Perhaps more interesting than the price markup (some of which is due to inflation, of course) is the fact that Buffett has held the home for that long in the first place. Billionaires and the upper echelons of the finance world in general tend to make headlines when they buy and sell properties, both because investors like to track every move of the big names in the industry and because those transactions are usually for large amounts of money. Ken Griffin, billionaire and founder of Citadel, for instance, has recently made news for buying up yet another property in a chain of beachside lots on Billionaires' Row in Palm Beach, Florida. But Buffett has generally remained out of the spotlight on such personal matters.

According to a report by the Mercury News , the California house features six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and covers 3500 square feet. Still, in comparison with the lavish estates of fellow billionaires, the home is quite modest. In Keeping With Buffett's Modest Lifestyle \nBuffett has tended to not live in a flashy way throughout his long and highly successful career. The billionaire seems to prefer to let his investments and business decisions speak for him. He has reportedly still been using the home in Laguna Beach as a vacation property with his family, even as he is now 86 years old and planning for the future of his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate as he shifts responsibility to other leaders. Buffett keeps his primary residence in Omaha, Nebraska and reportedly first purchased the California home for his first wife and not as an investment property. The house itself is \"on the simpler side\" in comparison with other properties in the area, according to Buffett's realtor. He remains the third-wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of more than $60 billion as of this writing.
