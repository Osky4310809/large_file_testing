Former West Ham, Newcastle, Charlton and Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has an overall Premier League win percentage in his management career of 35.8% Alan Pardew is not in the running to become the new Norwich City manager, BBC Radio Norfolk understands. \nFormer Crystal Palace and Newcastle boss Pardew, 55, had been linked with replacing Alex Neil who was sacked by the Championship club on Friday. \nCanaries caretaker boss Alan Irvine said after the weekend's 2-2 draw with Blackburn he expected to still be in charge against Barnsley on Saturday. \nChairman Ed Balls said Neil's sacking was the start of \"big changes\". \nNorwich are also expected to announce some more changes this week, having been without a chief executive since Jez Moxey left last month. \nNeil was sacked after just over two years at Carrow Road, following a run of five games without victory which left them nine points outside the top six. \nPardew was sacked by Palace in December, leaving them just a point above the Premier League relegation zone having led them to the FA Cup final last season.
