No. The best coach in the world is Jose Mourinho .

Jose is the best for me. \n“I think Guardiola has to win the Premier League to show he is one of the best ever. \n\"He has shown he can win titles in Spain and in Germany, and he probably thought he’d do the same in England.” Guardiola won trophies galore as boss of Barcelona and (above) Bayern Munich (Photo: Bongarts/Getty) Read More Karanka sure chairman Gibson is still in his corner despite \"really bad\" fortnight \nKaranka reckons the Premier League has been a culture shock to the former Barca and Bayern Munich boss, whose third-place side trail leaders Chelsea by 10 points going into the last 11 league games. \nHe added: “I think he’s realised that this is a different football, a different league, and he has grasped how difficult the challenge is. It’s taking him time to adapt and it’s not been easy for him. \n“It’s difficult when you arrive in a new country, with a new philosophy where a lot of things are different. He has some very good players, but the mentality here is different. Things are different and it takes time to adjust.” \nKaranka is yet to finish on the losing side in two previous encounters with Man City —including a famous FA Cup win for then-Championship Boro at the Etihad Stadium two years ago.
