Dorota Trupp/Flickr.com By Nadra Kareem Nittle Updated May 08, 2016 . \nIt’s no secret that family gatherings can cause stress and lead to conflict , especially if some of your relatives have racist views that you're staunchly against. \nSo, what’s the best way to proceed when a loved one not only seems small-minded but outright racist? Don’t suffer in silence through one family gathering after another. You can take a number of steps to stop the Archie Bunker of the family in his tracks. These strategies include setting boundaries and calling attention to the racist behavior. Be Direct \nConfrontations are never easy. That said, if you don’t want to listen to your parents or siblings rattle off racial stereotypes every Thanksgiving, the direct approach is necessary. How will your family members realize that you find their behavior offensive unless you let them know? \nThe moment your sister makes a racist joke or uses a racial stereotype, tell her that you’d appreciate it if she didn’t make such “jokes” or sweeping racial generalizations in front of you. If calling your relative out in front of others will make her more defensive, ask to speak with her privately and then make your feelings known. \nIf your family member uses a racial slur in front of you, request that she doesn’t use such epithets in your presence. Do so in a calm and firm voice. Make your request short and sweet and then move on. Don’t attack your family member’s character. Just let her know that her comments make you feel uncomfortable. Get Other Relatives to Help \nWhat if this particular family member intimidates you? He’s an elder or an in-law and you don’t feel comfortable calling attention to his inappropriate behavior—even if it is racist. Find a relative you feel more comfortable with and request that he accompany you as you confront your offensive family member. \nTell the insensitive family member that you love and appreciate him but find his views on race hurtful. Alternatively, if your grandfather has made a series of racially insensitive remarks, you might want to ask your parent to speak with him about his behavior. If your father-in-law is the guilty party, ask your spouse to confront him about his language and attitudes concerning race. \nIf no one else in your family can serve as an ally to you, consider taking a less direct approach to confront your bigoted relative. Write the person a brief letter or email informing him that you find his comments hurtful and asking him to refrain from such remarks in the future. Don’t Argue \nWhatever you do, don’t get into a racial debate with your racist relative. Agree to disagree with this family member about race rather than listening to her argue about why her racial stereotypes are valid and you’re just too politically correct. Stick to the following script: “I find your comments hurtful. Please don’t make these remarks in front of me again.” \nArguing with the relative will likely be a waste of time. The family member will be on the defensive and you will be on the offensive. Meanwhile, your relative will have learned next to nothing about racial sensitivity. Focus on your feelings about the relative’s comments rather than on the validity of her beliefs. Set Consequences \nDepending on your situation, you may have to set some guidelines with your racist relative. Say, for example, that you have children. Do you want your children to hear the drivel coming out of your family member’s mouth? If not, let your relatives know that if they make bigoted remarks in your children’s presence, you will leave the family gathering at once. \nIf your relatives routinely make such comments, let them know that you will be skipping family gatherings with them altogether. This is an especially important move to make if you’re in an interracial relationship or have multiracial children who will feel targeted by your family members’ insensitive comments. Open Their Eyes \nYou will probably not open your relatives’ eyes about race by arguing with them about the issue, but you can take some steps to free their minds. Organize a family trip to a museum with a social justice focus. Have movie night at your house and screen films that address issues of racial inequity or show minority groups in a positive light. Start a family book club and select anti-racist literature to read.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:10:35.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
