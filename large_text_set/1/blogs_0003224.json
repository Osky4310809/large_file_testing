One in every four Pakistani drives a taxi as their main income source, the survey found. \nThe survey further disclosed that 57% of Pakistani-origin women are either inactive – not part of the active workforce – or unemployed. This number is unusually higher than the proportion of inactive or unemployed women from other communities. The number of white women who are unemployed, in contrast, stands at 25%. \nThe survey found that a number of Pakistanis face hurdles settling in Britain due to inadequate English-speaking skills. 0 0 Pakistanis in Britain the ‘most backward community’: survey was posted in pakistan   British Pakistani Employment, British-pakistani, Geo News, Geo Tv, Latest News Pakistan, Pakistan, Pakistan News, Pakistanis In Britain, Britain, Pakistan.   \"Pakistanis in Britain the ‘most backward community’: survey\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/125807-Latest-survey-says-British-Pakistanis-the-most-backward-community .
