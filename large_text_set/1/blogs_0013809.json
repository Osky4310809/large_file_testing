Photo: Dan Provost \nApple’s rumored plans to launch three different sized iPads this spring has fans a bit confused as to why creating a new 10.5-inch model is a good idea. But according to the co-founder of Studio Neat Dan Provost, it actually wouldn’t be crazy for Apple to change the screen size when you look at the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. When revealing the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Phil Schiller explained Apple’s reason for choosing that width was because it is the exactly dimension as the height of the 9.7-inch iPad Air 2.\nIn a blog post detailing why Apple may choose a 10.5-inch screen on the iPad Pro, Provost says it makes perfect sense because the width of the new iPad would be the same as the height of the iPad mini. \n“The math works out perfectly. This new 10.5″ iPad would have the exact same resolution as the 12.9″ iPad Pro (2732 x 2048), but the same pixel density of the iPad mini (326 ppi instead of 264 ppi). Crunch the numbers, do a little Pythagorean Theorem, and you end up with a screen 10.5″ diagonal (10.47″ to be precise, but none of Apple’s stated screen sizes are exact). In terms of physcial dimensions, the width of this 10.5″ screen would be exactly the same as the height of the iPad mini screen.” \nBy using the same pixel density as the iPad mini 4 screen, Apple would be able to transition manufacturing much easier to the new device. Owners will get the resolution of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in the form factor of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, making it a super compelling product for pros on the go. \nThe new iPads are expected to be revealed at a keynote in March. Other features could include 3D Touch, an A10x processor, better battery life, and more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:03:04.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
