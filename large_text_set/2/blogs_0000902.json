In fact, picking the one that fits you right is! Half the battle is won if you are aware of your body shape and can pick an outfit that complements it well. \nWhile we all know that every body shape has its pros and cons, one of the trickiest is the apple shape. With a wide torso, broad shoulders, a full bust, narrow hips and a round waist, apple-shaped women often shy away from wearing lehengas as they feel it wouldn’t suit them. But here’s the good news! You can flaunt a lehenga if you choose wisely. So, here’s a quick guide on how to find the right lehenga designs for apple shaped women. \n​1. Pick fabrics that skim but do not cling. Let’s start with the basics. The key to picking any outfit is to choose the right fabric. Flowing silks and soft cottons in simple designs give you soft silhouettes that do not highlight those extra inches. What’s great is that these fabrics are two of the most comfortable you can choose from. \nOur picks \n2. Go for long cholis . Since you are heaviest in the middle, it’s best to pick lehengas that cover your problem area without compromising your style, and jacket style cholis are the best way to do it. So, the next time you pick a lehenga, make sure to pick long shirttails and rounded hems to cover the tummy. You could pick one with a long jacket or a short one, depending on the occasion. \nOur picks \nShop for designer lehengas . \n3. Avoid high necklines. We often fall for fashion trends that don’t actually suit us. So, while high neck blouses could be the in thing, they’re not meant for you. The key is to make your bust look smaller and high necklines would only draw attention to the upper half of your body, and not in a flattering way. Pick cholis with deep necklines like a V-neck, deep round neck or sweetheart neck to create an illusion of a smaller bust. \nOur picks \nShop for trendy lehengas . \n4. Stick to single colours. Avoid going overboard with colours. Monochromes or single colours work best. Multiple colours tend to divide your body in two halves, while single colours make you look slimmer and taller. Dark solid colour tops with light embroidery make your top half look slimmer. \nOur picks \n5. Avoid heavy embroidery on blouses. The key to style it right is not to draw attention to the upper half of your body. Choose a blouse with minimal embroidery, and steer clear of bold patterns. Also pick a lehenga that has heavy embroidery below the waist since you are a bit heavy in the middle and do not want to draw attention to that area. \nOur picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:17:14.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
