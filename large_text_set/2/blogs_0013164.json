Once upon a time, you were a household item, back when everyone knew how to sew a button on. You protected fingertips from sharp needles. You were heroic and you were immortalized as a playing piece in the Monopoly real estate-collecting board game. That immortality has now come to a premature end as modern Monopoly fans voted to dump the thimble. \nThe voting results came about through a ruthless online competition that pitted the classic tokens against dozens of upstart newcomers, including a dinosaur, emoji, a hashtag, a horse and a helicopter. Voting wrapped up at the end of January and now game-maker Hasbro is slowly sharing the results, starting with the demise of the thimble. \nThe thimble originally joined the game way back in 1935. The Monopoly Token Madness voting campaign pulled in over 4 million votes, but not enough backed the thimble to allow it stay in the competition for inclusion in future versions of the game. More Monopoly Monopoly fans diss robot, choose cat as new token \nThis isn't the first time a classic token has been shown the door. In 2013, Hasbro dropped the iron from the lineup and replaced it with a cute cat. \nThe thimble's axing is most likely the result of changing times and the onward march of technology in the world. Nowadays, most people just toss out clothes rather than learn to sew and repair them. The new thimble-less version of Monopoly will be out August. \nHasbro will reveal the final results from the voting and the identities of the winning tokens on World Monopoly Day on March 19. \nDo you mourn for the thimble? If not, then what is your favorite token? Pass go and tell us in the comments. \nSo long, thimble. Amanda Kooser/CNET \nIt's Complicated : This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?
