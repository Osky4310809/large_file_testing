Advertisement \nConstantine , based on the DC Hellblazer comic , was sadly dropped after one season on NBC. The show struggled to find its voice—even if they’d cast a near-perfect John Constantine in Ryan, who’s often talked about how much he adores the character. Ryan has since gone on to guest as Constantine on an episode of Arrow , and voiced the character in the Justice League Dark movie. Now, he’s getting an animated series of his very own on CW Seed—and his animated counterpart looks damn fine. Credit: The CW \nDeadline reports at least five 10-minute episodes have been ordered for CW Seed so far. Constantine will join Vixen , whose title character has made appearances on Arrow and DC’s Legends of Tomorrow , albeit by different actresses. Could this mean more appearances from John Constantine in other CW shows? Fingers crossed.
