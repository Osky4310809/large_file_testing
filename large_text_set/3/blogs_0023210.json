He was addressing a meeting of 68 countries and organizations gathered in Washington to discuss accelerating the battle against Isis. \n“The United States will increase our pressure on Isis and al-Qaida and will work to establish interim zones of stability, through ceasefires, to allow refugees to return home,” Tillerson told the gathering at the state department, where the former oil executive was hosting his first major diplomatic event. Human rights groups sound alarm over safe zones for Syrian refugees Read more \nAlthough it was unclear how the zones would work, creating any safe havens could ratchet up US military involvement in Syria and mark a major departure from President Barack Obama’s more cautious approach. \nAsked about Tillerson’s remarks, coalition spokesman Col Joseph Scrocca said the US military had not yet received direction to establish any kind of “zones”. \nIncreased US or allied air power would be required if President Donald Trump chooses to enforce “no fly” restrictions, and ground forces might also be needed to protect civilians in those areas. \nA final statement at the end of the meeting did not mention the possibility of safe zones. \nIsis has been losing ground in Iraq and Syria , with three separate forces, backed by the United States, Turkey and Russia, advancing on the group’s Syrian stronghold city of Raqqa. \nUS defense officials said on Wednesday the US-led coalition had airlifted Syrian rebel forces in an operation near the Syrian town of Tabqa in Raqqa province. \n“I recognize there are many pressing challenges in the Middle East, but defeating Isis is the United States’ number one goal in the region,” Tillerson said. \n“As a coalition we are not in the business of nation building or reconstruction,” he said, adding that resources should be focused on preventing the resurgence of Isis and equipping war-torn communities to rebuild. \nWednesday’s event was the first meeting of the coalition since the election of Trump, who has pledged to make the fight against Isis a priority.

The coalition has pledged more than $2bn in assistance for Iraq and Syria in 2017. \nIraqi government forces, backed by the US-led international coalition, retook several Iraqi cities from Isis last year and have liberated eastern Mosul. \nWhile the jihadist group is overwhelmingly outnumbered by Iraqi forces, it has been using suicide car bombs and snipers to defend its remaining strongholds. \nSpeaking to the same meeting, the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, called for unity in the region to combat Isis and outlined Iraq’s progress in the fight. \nHe said Iraq was now at the stage of “destroying” Islamic State , not just “containing” it. Recounting a Tuesday conversation with the Iraqi leader, Senator Lindsey Graham said Abadi believed reconstruction of Anbar province as well as Mosul in Nineveh province would cost about $50bn.
