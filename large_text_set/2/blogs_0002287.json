Now that Kareena has delivered last month, people just cannot help but still talk about how the actress broke all stereotypes. At the Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resprt 2017 today, Aamir Khan’s wife Kiran Rao was asked to give her take on the same. On Kareena breaking stereotypes, Kiran said, “I love Kareena. She is great and I am looking forward to what she does at the fashion week this time around.” Absolutely, we second that! Well, it’s not just you Kiran, but we too are eagerly waiting to see how Bebo will set the ramp on fire this time. Remember the last time she walked the ramp was for Sabyasachi? She looked MAJESTIC in that outfit as she graced the stage with the baby bump. Kareena, if you are reading this, we just cannot wait to see you walk the ramp again. \nEver since Taimur Ali Khan has been born, the actress is busy taking care of her baby. But that hasn’t kept her away from doing her usual things. Every other day Bebo is spotted with her girl gang going out to lunch dates and we must say, we quite like that! After pregnancy, her life has come back to normal.. I mean, isn’t that great? Not a lot of women are able to maintain a healthy balanace between their personal life and family life. Kareena and Kiran have always been the best of friends and for Kiran to have said such kind words for Kareena definitely mean a lot to the actress.
