By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 14, 2017 1:43 PM Manohar Parrikar (Reuters/Twitter) \nGoa Assembly Elections 2017: Even though Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) could not emerge as the single largest party on its own, its strong intent and hunger to form the government in the state was evident in the way the party handled the post-election results. After having secured only 13 seats as against Congress ’ 17, BJP quickly garnered support from other small parties/independents and staked claim. BJP even fulfilled the demand made by the other parties and had Manohar Parrikar leave the Defence minister post and rush to Goa. Goa governor Mridula Sinha appointed Parrikar as the Chief Minister on the 12th of March, a decision which did not go down well with the Congress. It claims that being the largest single party, it is the Congress which should have been invited to form the government in the state. \nThe Supreme Court today heard Congress’ plea and quizzed the party over the inordinate delay by it in approaching the Governor with affidavits of all the MLAs who are willing to support it in the assembly. Some Congress MLAs have accepted that it was the party’s shortcomings that it took so long to approach the governor. However, Robert Vadra, husband of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, accused the BJP of trying to adopt new procedures to abolish the already established constitutional practice. Rahul Gandhi on the other hand has accepted his defeat and has said that every party has its ups and downs and it had its ‘downer’ in Uttar Pradesh. While the Supreme Court decided to put an end to the tug of war in Goa by ordering a floor test, Twitter had its own judgement on Manohar Parrikar’s fast-track transition from Defence Minister to Goa Chief Minister; read all about it: \nArun Shourie [email protected] \nParrikar going back to Goa is good news in the interest of nation. Already 100s of Congress MPs in BJP, now BJP must import RM too from INC!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T10:18:26.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
