Lets give Ruperta the oportunity to have the life she deserves! read petition letter ▾ \nRuperta is a 46 year old African elephant, living in captivity at the Caricuao Zoo Park in Caracas Venezuela.On Friday 24th she fell and was unable to stand by her own due to her state of dehydration result of malnutrition and diarrea . Firefighters of the neighborhood helped to lift her up. People near by collected food to help feed the animal, but the zoo didn't accept it because of \"security reasons\".Some workers of the Inparques union, the organization that regulates zoos in Venezuela, have made official complaints against the goverment to help find a solution to the food problem of venezuelan zoos, having no response.So, what we want with this petition is to have the life conditions of Ruperta to be guaranteed, and relocate her in an animal sanctuary. We need to remember that Ruperta is an elephant, and endangered specie protected by international laws that are being violated right now having the elephant in this condition. Lets raise our voice in defense of those who can not speak, and guarantee the life and living conditions that this beautiful animal deserve. The world is fighting to save elephants from extinction, while they die in Venezuela locked up in zoos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T08:32:38.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
