The video sees Pewdiepie choose the above phrase and then look visibly stunned when he indeed gets exactly what he paid for. \nThe video concluded with Pewdiepie apologising: \n\"So that's Fiverr. What an experience. Wow. I didn't expect that. I don't feel great about this. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I don't know what else to say.\" \nMaker Studios, which has partnered with Pewdiepie for years, decided the stunt was one too far. \n\"Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate,\" Maker Studios said in a statement to Wall Street Journal . \nMaker Studios is a network of YouTube channels that works together to share promotion and advertising deals. Snapped up by Disney in 2014 for $675m, it signed Pewdiepie to last year launch Revelmode - his own sub-network of partner channels. \nThe video was created by Indian men who have since claimed they did not understand the message they were reading out. The pair were banned from Fiverr, although Pewdiepie successfully lobbied on their behalf for their account to be saved. \nWall Street Journal, which broke this story, published its article accompanied by a compilation of other references to Nazis in Pewdiepie's videos - such as him discovering player-made swastikas in his game Tuber Simulator, and a gag where he was unwittingly caught gazing at an Adolf Hitler speech on YouTube. \nEdited together, the compilation paints a negative picture. Wall Street Journal's compilation. \nPewdiepie has never shied away from controversy or deliberately-offensive humour, but has now pulled several of the videos shown in the compilation. \nAnd while he has won a record-breaking 53m subscribers for his ability to shock and satirise, Pewdiepie has been criticised for not engaging his platform - and particularly his younger audience - in a wiser manner. \nBut for Pewdiepie, who sees his channel as entirely for entertainment, and who bases many of his skits on his viewers understanding the fact he doesn't believe what he's saying, the issue of who watches his videos has lately become a problem. \nIn particular, the 11th January video won Pewdiepie support from white supremiscists who see him as a messenger for racist views. This, perhaps, may be Disney's biggest worry - not that Pewdiepie doesn't align with its image but but that his words are now being taken literally and celebrated by alt-right sites such as The Daily Stormer. \nThe issue is only exacerbated by the current US political climate and the rise of extreme right-wing views in the mainstream. Any suggestion that Pewdiepie was aiding this, even unwittingly, would be a dangerous one for a family brand like Disney to stand behind. \nIn response, Pewdiepie has now published a statement to, in his words, make things clear.
