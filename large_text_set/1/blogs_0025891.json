Not only is this extremely hypocritical, but it is a threat to national security. Trump has proven again and again that he doesn't respect the intelligence agencies in our country. This means he is unlikely to take seriously which pieces of information must be protected and which do not. This makes for a scary combination. Sign this petition to demand that Trump stops using his personal, unsecured android phone and commits to using only protecting forms of communication.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:25:05.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
