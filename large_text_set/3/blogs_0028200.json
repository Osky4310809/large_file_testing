Ryancare? This thing is a joke. Most Popular By Jack Holmes Mar 24, 2017 While President Trump was playing trucks yesterday afternoon, America's ongoing healthcare fiasco was ramping up. The AHCA, the bill backed by the president and Speaker Paul Ryan, has been on the ropes all week, and Republican leaders in the House have responded by trying to rush it through with a series of overnight changes meant to appease conservatives at the cost of, well, good healthcare. Seth Meyers broke down the various absurdities and hypocrisies in play: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Popular Republicans raised hell in 2009, decrying the speed and shadiness of Obamacare's writing and passage. That culminated in a yell session from John Boehner on the House floor, dug up by Meyers, in which Boehner screamed rhetorical questions about things being done \"behind closed doors.\" Over the last few days, Republicans have continually rewritten this bill behind closed doors, primarily to appease their most unhinged conservative colleagues in the Freedom Caucus, to the point that no one is quite sure what will be in the final bill. The Congressional Budget Office won't be able to show us much , either: After finding the first iteration would throw 24 million Americans off insurance, and the second one would jettison even more while doing less to reduce the budget deficit, the CBO won't be given time to score this one before it goes up for a vote. The Party of Fiscal Responsibility strikes again. Oh, and by the way: Obamacare took 14 months to pass. This has taken less than three weeks. Get beyond all the hypocrisies in the process, though, and you get to the absurdities of the substanceâ€”at least what we've heard about it. The key to appeasing the Freedom Caucus loons seems to be striking the \"essential benefits\" mandates in Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act said insurance companies had to provide you with certain core benefits if you pay for their insurance. This includes things like pregnancy and maternity care, prescription drug coverage, and hospital visits. House Republicans plan to strike this requirement, so that while you'll still need to get insurance or face a stiff penalty from insurance companies when you do sign up, those insurance companies won't need to provide you with any actual coverage. Pretty sweet deal, right? Especially if you're an insurance executive, who's also getting a massive tax cut . It's almost like the Freedom Caucus isn't about freedom, but more aggressively pushing the agenda of special interests. That's how someone can come to believe that having insurance pay for a hospital visit is just another example of Big Government getting between you and your doctor. \"But don't worry,\" Meyers offered by way of consolation, \"Every American gets one free ride on the cart that picks up your dead.\" Related Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:54:13.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
