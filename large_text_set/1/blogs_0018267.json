A photo posted by Carli Lloyd (@carlilloyd) on Jan 22, 2017 at 8:18pm PST \nBased on the new women’s colorway of the Mercurial, the special-edition boots feature motivational prints across the upper, as well as a “World Player of the Year 2016” inscription on the outstep. \nSimilar to last year’s special edition “Leave Your Legacy” boot, this year’s offering from Nike isn’t expected to go on sale to the general public, but will likely be raffled off in limited supply. \nWith January camp wrapping up today, the USWNT next takes on Germany on March 1. That’s when Lloyd could break out the special boots for the national team’s first action in the new year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T22:33:46.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
