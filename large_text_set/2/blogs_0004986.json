More ways to play \nControllers like the Wiimote or the Wii U's Gamepad would be tricky to revive, since you'd also need to tack on a sensor bar to use their motion control capabilities, but it wouldn't hurt if other, simpler accessories from the Wii U days made a comeback. \nThe wireless Wii U Pro Controller, which closer resembles the 'conventional' gamepad, has been a go-to for many Wii U owners and would be a welcome addition on the Switch - not to mention also a wallet-saver, considering the Switch's Pro Controller costs a pretty penny at $69.99 (about £60/AU$90). \nOf course, nothing is confirmed yet, with Nintendo more focused on the Switch's launch. In the same interview, Kimishima even explained that a web browser was cu t from the Switch for the time being to make it a more dedicated gaming system. \nUntil then, we'll cross our fingers and hope the Joy-Con controllers packed in with the Switch are built to last - those thing ain't much cheaper at $49.99 (about £40/AU$70) each!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:18:36.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
