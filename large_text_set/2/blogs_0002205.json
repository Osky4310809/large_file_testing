Every now and then, these ladies remind us that suits are not just a man's domain, but that women can wear and flaunt them just as much. These celebrities are wearing them with some serious sex appeal thanks to slim cuts, cropped pants, and-in some cases-nothing underneath. Let's take a look! \n1. Kangana Ranaut is definitely someone who loves power dressing and dons pantsuits quite often. As one of the speakers at the Times Lit Fest recently, she chose to go for a monochrome Cheetah-print suit from Dior's Fall-2016 collection. Keeping the look minimal without any accessories, she finished the look with a pair of metallic pumps and a dewy face! \n2. Channelling her XXX character, Deepika Padukone wore a Johanna Ortiz all-black suit for the Mexico premiere of the movie. With a ruffled peplum top, voluminous sleeves, revealing neckline and the stand-tall pants, this one breaks away from the monotony of regular coat-pant suits. Definitely a winner! \n3. At the recent premiere of XXX: Return Of Xander Cage premiere in Mumbai, Diana Penty looked sharp in a gold ASOS suit, Swarovski jewellery, and Christian Louboutin heels and sling bag. Her accessory game is clearly strong, AF. \n4. Vaani Kapoor, attended the Elle Graduates Show on Tuesday in a Payal Khandwala suit. The brocade number was a fresh twist to regular pantsuits. However, we do feel the fit and styling could have been better! \n5. Huma Qureshi showed up in a black pantsuit to the sets of Yaaron Ki Baraat . While the Zara suit may look boring otherwise, the actress jazzed it up with a faux leather bustier and Christian Louboutin shoes! \n6. Kudos to Sonam Kapoor for showing us how easy and comfortable suits can be. No, you don't have to wear these only to fancy events, but even to an airport. We absolutely love how she paired the set with a cropped top and Nike kicks! \n7. Breaking free from her regular â€˜girly' image, Alia Bhatt wore an all-white satin power suit to Koffee With Karan recently. The actress kept the look minimal with a pair of black heels, beach-wavy hair and smokey eyes! \n8. Aditi Rao Hydari has to be one of the most underrated fashion icons of Bollywood! With crimped hair, the choker and muted make-up, she took on a ride to the 90's in this emerald suit by Natalie Chapman. Definitely no complaints here! \n9. Upping her fashion game, Sonakshi Sinha recently wore a brown pin-striped suit by Ragini Ahuja. The flare pants, longer-than-usual blazer and the ultimate fringed leather bralette made for a glam combination. \n10. Just recently, at a fashion show, the Masaan actress Richa Chaddha wore a three piece suit with stripes running in all directions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T13:48:47.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
