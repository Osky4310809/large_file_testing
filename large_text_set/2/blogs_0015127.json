The deal is pending a physical. \nVelazquez, who hails from Sonora, Mexico, most recently pitched in the Mexican Pacific Winter League for the Mayos de Navojoa. He went 9-3 with a 2.32 ERA and 87 strikeouts over 85 1/3 innings and 14 starts and made five scoreless starts of at least five innings. \nVelazquez enjoyed a successful 2016 regular season with Monclova while on loan from Campeche, going 5-1 with a 2.47 ERA, 120 strikeouts and 16 walks over 131 1/13 innings in 22 starts. He allowed two earned runs or fewer in 15 of his starts and never allowed more than four earned runs in a single game. \nThe right-hander is on a minor-league contract and was invited to spring training. \nThumbnail photo via Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:39:56.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
