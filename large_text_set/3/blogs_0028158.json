Slashdot reader AmiMoJo quotes The Register: Three people in Illinois have filed a lawsuit against Microsoft , claiming that its Windows 10 update destroyed their data and damaged their computers. The complaint, filed in Chicago's U.S. District Court on Thursday, charges that Microsoft Windows 10 [installer] is a defective product , and that its maker failed to provide adequate warning about the potential risks posed by Windows 10 installation -- specifically system stability and data loss... The attorneys representing the trio are seeking to have the case certified as a class action that includes every person in the U.S. who upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 and suffered data loss or damage to software or hardware within 30 days of installation. They claim there are hundreds or thousands of affected individuals. Microsoft responded that they'd offered free customer service and other support options for \"the upgrade experience,\" adding \"We believe the plaintiffs' claims are without merit.\" But the complaint argues Windows 10's installer \"does not check the condition of the PC and whether or not the hard drive can withstand the stress of the Windows 10 installation,\" according to Courthouse News , which adds that the lead plaintiff \"says her hard drive failed after Windows 10 installed without her express approval, and she had to buy a new computer .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:34:45.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
