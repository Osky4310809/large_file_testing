Because of course he’d be a detective in a noir story. \nEvidently the new season will have Archer be reintroduced to the rest of the cast of characters in their new, noir stylized roles, according to Entertainment Weekly . There’s also a lot of care in the classic autos rolling around in the trailer, which we’ll have to track down and identify at some point.

Oh, one important note: the season will premiere April 5th on FXX, not FX. I’ve never heard of it either, but there you are.
