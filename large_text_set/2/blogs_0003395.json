One spot featured Justin Bieber and Rob ‚ÄúGronk‚Äù Gronkowski of the New England Patriots dancing, while another had the comedic duo Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg throwing around some tongue-in-cheek marijuana euphemisms , and finally there was the above 50 Shades of Grey style parody starring Kristen Schaal who enjoyed being punished for her naughty, naughty Verizon Wireless data overages.\nIt was the latter that the rival cell carrier seemed to take the most umbrage with, and Schaal and the T-Mobile official Twitter account indulging in some playful back and forth banter during the game only seemed to twist the knife deeper.\n. @Verizon overages hurt so bad. Do you punish your customers that way, @TMobile ? #TheSafeWordisUnlimited \n‚Äî Kristen Schaal (@kristenschaaled) February 5, 2017 \nSorry @Kristenschaaled but with our UNLIMITED network, you won‚Äôt feel the pain of overages.

Say yes! #TheSafeWordisUnlimited pic.twitter.com/6CZnMs4acS \n‚Äî Kristen Schaal (@kristenschaaled) February 6, 2017 \nOverages from @Verizon are like little scoldings on my bill. @TMobile are you gonna get tough with me? #TheSafeWordisUnlimited \n‚Äî Kristen Schaal (@kristenschaaled) February 6, 2017 \nThink you‚Äôve had too much?

Bigger coverage map, Devastating Speed, and Massive capacity.\n‚Äî Verizon (@verizon) February 6, 2017 \nUnfortunately no one will hear your safe word if you're on @Tmobile . ü§ê\n‚Äî Verizon (@verizon) February 6, 2017 \n\nWell that got pretty weird, pretty fast. But things got even weirder when the Verizon customer service Twitter account started trolling Schaal as well.\nGuys‚Ä¶ Verizon customer service just contacted Kristen.
