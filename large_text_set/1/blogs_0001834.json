Durkin | 8:16 am, January 3rd, 2017 \nMake no mistake about it — the story of the morning is the House GOP vote to severely weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics (or, as PBS Newshour called it, “ eviscerate “). \nThe New York Times reported late last night , “House Republicans, overriding their top leaders, voted on Monday to significantly curtail the power of an independent ethics office set up in 2008 in the aftermath of corruption scandals that sent three members of Congress to jail.” \nThe move itself is controversial on many fronts, one of which is the lack of substantive debate or notice of the vote until after it was done. Additionally, Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) adopted the proposal which would put the currently independent office under the umbrella of the House Ethics Committee… which will be under the influence of the lawmakers themselves. \nSo much for draining the swamp . \nBut despite the effort to subdue the OCE by Republicans, the President-elect — in typical fashion — took to Twitter this morning in an attempt to throw the dogs off the scent by invoking wildly unrelated topics from the news late Monday. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn’t work, and it is not affordable – 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it “CRAZY” \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said “The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!”– And, it is lousy healthcare. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 \nIt’s his newest “ Look over here instead !” effort, a flash grenade he hopes will spur the conversation about jobs and Obamacare instead of the news surrounding the Office of Congressional Ethics. \nInterestingly (but perhaps unsurprisingly), Trump’s Twitter comments regarding the Affordable Care Act came just minutes after pollster Frank Luntz appeared on Fox & Friends to harangue the signature piece of legislation for the outgoing President. Was Trump watching Fox, then took it upon himself to Tweet from his Android about the ACA? Seems possible, if not outright likely. \nThen again, a press conference would really do the trick to lay out all the cards on the table and finally bring about a bit of transparency.
