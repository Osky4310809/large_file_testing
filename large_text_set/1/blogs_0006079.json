In September Mr Khan ordered a review into whether the public had so far been given value for money from the project, adding he believed there had not \"been the necessary standard of transparency and openness around the Garden Bridge\". \nThat review, led by Dame Margaret Hodge, a former chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, has yet to report back but Mr Khan has already said that no more taxpayer money will be provided to fund the project. \nIn October it emerged that former prime minister David Cameron had ignored the advice of civil servants over Garden Bridge funding , personally intervening to approve extra taxpayer money for the controversial project. \nThe National Audit Office (NOA) said at the time that nearly £23m of taxpayer money was at risk of being lost.
