Just take a look at #StrongNotSkinny , which took the internet by storm. From people celebrating its message to well-thought-out analyses of its more problematic aspects, the hashtag started important dialogues about body image , beauty, and what it means to be strong as well as sexy. And one blogger has taken this conversation a step further, adding a new dimension to the idea of strength, sexiness, and being body-positive .\nKathleen Elizabeth Tyler is a a blogger who focuses on the positive. So it should come as no surprise that her take on #StrongNotSkinny highlighted the good aspects of the hashtag.\nBut unlike most people, who interpreted the hashtag as a call to hit the gym without worrying about your weight , Tyler turned the message into something much more profound. I often times see people in recovery saying that they aspire to be \"#strongnotskinny,\" so tonight I wanted to let y'all know that there are ways to achieve this goal that don't involve daily visits to the gym. I don't exercise, and no that doesn't mean I sit around all day doing nothing, it simply means that I find ways in my daily life to move around without making my life about when I am going to fit in my daily mandatory visit to the gym: but I still am so very strong. -Kicking my eating disorder's ass= strong -Reporting my sexual abuse despite the fact that a majority of women in America are still to this day harshly accused of lying about the thing that destroyed their ability to feel safety= strong -Deciding to wake up and love myself everyday= strong -Advocating against the illness that almost took my life= strong So the next time you are getting down on yourself because you chose extra fries over exercise, please remember that strength isn't only found in lifting weights and sometimes choosing the extra fries is exactly the kind of strength that will allow you to defeat your demons. #rollsarentjustforcinnamon \nA photo posted by Kathleenü§ò (@fallingintoselflove) on Jan 18, 2017 at 6:02pm PST \nWith amazing candor and grace, Taylor talked about what #StrongNotSkinny meant to her. From fighting an eating disorder to reporting her sexual assault, Taylor in no way glossed over the hard parts of life. Instead, she used them to explain exactly why she is so strong. It‚Äôs not about hitting the gym every day (although if that makes you feel good, go for it). It‚Äôs about taking care of yourself, loving yourself, and finding strength in unexpected places. Maybe the gym makes you strong; maybe it‚Äôs going to therapy, or talking with your friends, or watching your favorite television show.\n‚ÄúThe next time you are getting down on yourself because you chose extra fries over exercise, please remember that strength isn‚Äôt only found in lifting weights and sometimes choosing the extra fries is exactly the kind of strength that will allow you to defeat your demons.‚Äù When I was little I was often times told I could have only one cookie, that more than one cookie would mean that I needed to get some extra exercise. As I grew older and had the freedom to decide for myself, between the nutrition labels and serving sizes I still believed I could have only one cookie. So tonight, as a little f u to all of the nutrition labels that know nothing about me or my personal nutritional needs, I made one very very large sugar cookie(decked out in lemon cream cheese frosting and fruit). And I plan on taking bites on this cookie until my body is full and my hunger is satisfied:):):) \nA photo posted by Kathleenü§ò (@fallingintoselflove) on Jan 21, 2017 at 7:56pm PST \nIn this world, sometimes loving yourself ‚Äî fabulous, messy, complicated, and real ‚Äî is the truest example of strength that there is.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:52:29.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
