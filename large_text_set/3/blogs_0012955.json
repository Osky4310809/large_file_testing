They believe they’ve done so with Mason Plumlee, who has averaged 9.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.6 assists off the bench since arriving in Denver. Since Plumlee arrived on Feb. 15, the Nuggets are 16th in the NBA in defensive rating at 107.5 points per 100 possessions, and coach Michael Malone credits Plumlee’s versatility as a big reason for the improvement for a team that was last in defensive rating before his arrival. \nAs with most trades it will take time to determine who truly gained the upper hand, but my thought is the Nuggets are a better team than they were when an unhappy Nurkic was playing sparingly off the bench. And improvement is the main objective in almost any deal. \nDo you believe the Nuggets will change their jerseys when Nike takes over? If so how do you think they’ll look? \n— Wesley Erickson, Butte, Montana \nWesley: This is a great question. You can be sure that Nike won’t just quietly take over the uniforms when their new eight-year deal as the NBA’s apparel provider begins next season. There will be a splash when the sneaker-and-clothing giant assumes control next year and a marketing blitz to follow. \nWe already know that teams will be able to sell a patch on the jersey to sponsors, a new revenue stream the league approved last year. It’s an option I’m sure most teams will explore, including the Nuggets. \nAs far as any logo or color-scheme changes, those decisions would still be left with the teams. The Nuggets haven’t been shy about adding new looks in both departments in recent years, so it’s not implausible to think more changes could be on the way. One thing you can count on as Nike takes over? Sleeves on jerseys are likely gone, and that’s something most players will celebrate. \nDo you feel like the current Nuggets squad could upset the Warriors in the first round of the playoffs? \n— Jrock, Fort Collins \nJrock: The simple answer is no. Despite the Nuggets routing the Warriors when the two teams played at the Pepsi Center on Feb. 13, Golden State simply has far too much firepower for the Nuggets to handle. Denver could steal a game in the series at home, but this team is not ready to contend for a championship. \nThe bigger question might be whether Denver matches up better against the Spurs, who are now tied for the top spot in the Western Conference, or the Warriors. The race for the No. 1 spot is even tighter than the pursuit of the No. 8 spot, and I think the Nuggets match up better against the Warriors. The Nuggets can play their free-flowing style against Golden State more so than they could against San Antonio. \nBut no matter the opponent, don’t make second-round travel arrangements. \nAt the start of the season, there was talk the Nuggets’ salary number was low, per the union agreement, and the Nuggets would have to acquire some players by the end of the year to increase the salary number. Now that the trade deadline has passed, is the low salary number still an issue? \n— John Persing, Wellington \nJohn: The salary floor is 90 percent of the NBA salary. That numbers equates to roughly $84.7 million this season. A team that doesn’t spend the salary minimum by the end of the season is forced to make up the difference in payments to players on its roster. The Nuggets midway through the summer were at roughly $66 million, which initially spawned discussion about the salary floor. Moves since then, though, have moved the Nuggets much closer to the minimum. \nAfter acquiring center Roy Hibbert from Milwaukee at the trade deadline in a salary-dump move for the Bucks, the Nuggets are within $2.1 million of the minimum, according to SportTrac. That leaves the Nuggets with little concern about the salary floor closing in. \nNick, I have been Nuggets fan since 2001 when I first came to the U.S. from South Sudan. Do you think the Nuggets will ever get a NBA championship in the future? If no, what will the front office do differently to make them a contender in years to come? Do you think ownership will build a team around rising star Nikola Jokic or he will be a lone star? \n— Daniel Lual, Denver \nDaniel: The full answer to this question would require more space allotted for this mailbag. For starters, the Nuggets believe they have finally found the direction that will point them toward contention. It starts with a deep stable of talented players who are still younger than 23 years old. That includes, as you mentioned, 22-year-old center Jokic, who has blossomed into one of the NBA’s most promising centers. There is no doubt Jokic is the centerpiece around which the Nuggets will build. The question is whether the team already has the supporting stars around him necessary to pursue a title. \nWith Jamal Murray continuing to take strides at the point-guard spot as a rookie and third-year guard Gary Harris continuing to blossom as a two-way standout, the Nuggets could be on the verge of developing an intriguing big three in the next season or two. \nWhat I’m curious to see is whether Jokic’s unselfish, ball-sharing game will be enticing for prospective free agents. The Nuggets have evaluated well in the draft in recent years, but can they convince an established defensive stopper or rim protector to join the team? That could decide how quickly they can firmly land on a contending path. \nWhat do you see the rotation being when the entire squad is healthy? Do you see Jokic and Plumlee playing more together when Jokic returns? \n— Stephen Hernandez, Denver \nStephen: At the time of this writing, Jokic has in fact returned from the flu and his minutes alongside Plumlee are increasing. Malone has said since shortly after Plumlee’s arrival that he wants to get the two big men on the court together for more minutes because the presence of both, given their ability to handle and pass the ball, provides Denver with versatility on both ends of the court. As the Nuggets continue their stretch run toward the playoffs, expect to see these two on the court together more often. \nNick, March Madness is upon us and I am wanting to know who you like right now. \n— Jeff, Aurora ​ \nJeff: This field seems wide open to me, which will make for three super exciting weekends coming up. I think Arizona out of the Pac-12 is playing as well as anyone and will make a run to the Final Four. But as far as the champion? Give me the team that captured the title in dramatic fashion last season. I’ll take Villanova in a repeat. \nDenver Post sports writer Nick Kosmider posts his Nuggets Mailbag every other Tuesday during the regular season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:15:01.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
