I am sure we will get something done - he is playing as well as he ever has done.\" \nHe added: \"We have played better and been beaten in recent weeks, we got goals at good times and then saw the game out quite comfortably. \nConte: Chelsea's schedule only being criticised because we're top \n\"We didn't really have to deal with too many moments of anxiety. It's good to get a clean sheet, because we have shipped some poor goals in recent weeks.\" \nIt is now five games without a win for Walter Mazzarri's Watford, whose side sit seven points above the relegation zone. \n\"We played well, but two episodes, two mistakes, and they managed to score goals,\" Mazzarri was quoted as saying. \nWenger slams fixture schedule despite remarkable Bournemouth comeback \n\"We could have scored before them and we didn't do it, but we demonstrated we can play against a difficult team like Stoke. \n\"We have to keep going and give everything for the next match. Nothing is going our way, so it is just a period we are not lucky but we need to change this. \n\"We have many injuries, so it is not a positive period.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T02:31:13.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
