Throughout history, the famed boxer has made headlines, including his stance on the Vietnam War. Muhammad wanted people to know why he refused to serve, even when it could’ve landed him in prison as well as cost him millions of dollars.\nHere’s what you need to know: 1. He Refused to Serve in Vietnam & Was Stripped of His Heavyweight Title Muhammad Ali is seen here in 1967 defending his title against Ernie Terrell. (Getty) \nOn April 28, 1967, Ali refused to be inducted into the U.S. Army and was stripped of his hard-earned heavyweight title . Risking nearly everything, he stood firm on his stance to stay out of the Vietnam War. Ali proclaimed : \nMy conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people, or some poor hungry people in the mud for big powerful America. And shoot them for what? They never called me nigger, they never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob me of my nationality, rape and kill my mother and father… Shoot them for what? How am I going to shoot them? Poor little black people, little babies, and children, women. How can I shoot them poor people? Just take me to jail. 2. He Was Convicted of Draft Evasion (Getty) \nOn June 20, 1967, Ali was convicted of draft evasion. He was fined $10,000 and sentenced to five years in prison. He was also banned from boxing for three years, reported history.com . Ali appealed the case and avoided prison time. He returned to the boxing ring on October 26, 1970. Ali stated the following on his refusal to be drafted: \nWhy should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on Brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights? No I’m not going 10,000 miles from home to help murder and burn another poor nation simply to continue the domination of white slave masters of the darker people the world over. This is the day when such evils must come to an end. I have been warned that to take such a stand would cost me millions of dollars. But I have said it once and I will say it again. The real enemy of my people is here. I will not disgrace my religion, my people or myself by becoming a tool to enslave those who are fighting for their own justice, freedom and equality. If I thought the war was going to bring freedom and equality to 22 million of my people they wouldn’t have to draft me, I’d join tomorrow. I have nothing to lose by standing up for my beliefs. So I’ll go to jail, so what? We’ve been in jail for 400 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:15:20.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
