If proven successful, it will also be rolled out in places like sports stadiums, train stations and malls.\nThe company will start selling the service to facility owners from March.\nBut that's not all. KDDI also wants to start a service that analyses the amount of water needed to flush toilets.\nAn internet-connected valve will analyse the amount of time the person was in the cubicle and based on that, predict how much water needs to be dispensed.\nThis is the world we live in. \nBONUS: Someone came up with a night light for toilet bowls", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:30:53.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
