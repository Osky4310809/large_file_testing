PPD/Released \nZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines - Only 54 of the more than 300 “rogue” cops arrived here Tuesday morning aboard Air Force C-130 plane from Manila and were deployed to Basilan province. \nChief Superintendent Theodore Sindac, police director of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), welcomed the 54 policemen as they reached the Edwin Andrews Air Base (EAAB). \nThe cops, most of them were only facing administrative cases for misbehavior, were later escorted to the Naval Force Western Mindanao (NFWM) and transported to Basilan aboard the naval Landing Ship Transport (LST). \nSindac said he was no idea why majority of those 300 erring members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) did not show up for deployment. \n“I cannot say, I have no idea,” Sindac told the people from the press while conducting the headcount and accounting of the firearms which the police personnel brought with them. \nHe said he cannot answer categorically on the failure of most of those sanctioned police personnel, citing that they were only the receiving end.   \n“'Yung mga hindi nakarating, sisimulan na namin silang bilangan for the subsequent filing of the absence without leave (AWOL),” Sindac said. \nBased on his initial appraisal, 30 of the cops came from National Capital Region, ten from Police Regional Office (PRO) 2, eight from PRO 3 and two from Cordillera region. \nSindac said the processing will be done in Basilan where the said erring cops will undergo drug testing and briefing of their assignment. \nThe police director said that as organic members of the PNP, the involved cops will be utilized to the best of their abilities. \nThere will be no particular programs prepared by the PRO-ARMM in the transformation of the members of the erring police personnel. \n“There will be no retraining, no transformation. They will be considered as one of us. Lalaban sila side-by-side with the PNP officers and men of PRO-ARMM and the police in Basilan will be augmented to fight against the Abu Sayyaf,” he said. \nSindac, however, declined to elaborate the particular deployment of the cops, citing such as operational matters. \nBut he assured the police personnel of their security and protection. He said they will undergo orientation like cultural sensitivity since they will be assigned in a Muslim-dominated area. \nSindac said the involved cops are prepared even without retraining to join operations side-by-side with the local police and military troops. \n“Dito masusubukan ang tapang at galing nila. As you know ARMM is the home of the brave policemen. Sa Basilan at sa south nanggagaling ang maraming Medal of Valor award. Dito nanggagaling ang naging AFP at PNP chief at dito rin umaangat ang ranggo dahil dito nasusubukan ang galing at tapang ng mga na-assign,” the PNP official said.
