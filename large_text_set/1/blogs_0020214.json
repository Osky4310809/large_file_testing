(REUTERS/Carlos Barria) Imagine you've been roaming the National Mall for hours, when America's front yard can feel like America's front line, and your kids suddenly hit the wall. Not the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall, but the invisible wall of hunger, the one that leaves young ones crankier than a one-eyed purple Minion hankering for a banana . \nNow imagine you don’t have bottled water or Goldfish snacks to calm your savage preteen. Where near the vast Mall would you turn, when even a short walk with a famished child can feel like a Lewis and Clark expedition over the Great Divide?

Fourth Street and Independence Ave. SW. \nNational Place food court has lots of seating, with fare from local burger and fries favorite Five Guys and Korean taco joint TaKorean. 1331 Pennsylvania Ave. NW. \nTeaism is great for a quick, healthful meal or pot of tea, plus kids love the koi pond in the eatery's lower level. 400 Eighth St. NW, 202-638-6010. \nPitango sells excellent gelato far better than the packaged treats hawked from carts around the museums. 413 Seventh St. NW, 202-885-9607. \nRed Apron has some first-rate sandwiches that will keep you satiated for hours. 709 D St. NW, 202 524 5244. \nWTF (stands for Woodward Takeout Food, thank you very much), where you can dig into the freshly made flatbreads, sandwiches (including grilled cheese for the wee ones) and desserts, all overseen by Jeffrey Buben , one of the most demanding and discerning chefs in the District. 1426 H St. NW, 202-347-5355.
