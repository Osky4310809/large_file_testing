It's been quite the journey. So many ups and downs. So many times I wanted to relapse but sat on my hands and begged God to relieve the obsession,\" she captioned a photo of her milestone. \"I'm so proud of myself but I couldn't have done it without my higher power (God), my family, friends, and everyone else who supported me. Feeling humbled and joyful today. Thank you guys for sticking by my side and believing in me.  \" \nAs you might remember, the pop star checked into rehab in 2010 for a three-month stint after she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Since then, her advocacy for mental health awareness has been all too incredibly. From incorporating her struggles into her music to releasing a recent documentary called \"Beyond Silence,\" on the illness, Lovato will be one of the few honorees for her work at The Jane and Terry Semel Institute's biannual Open Minds Gala on March 22 at the Beverly Hilton.
