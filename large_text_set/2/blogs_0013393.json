Philstar.com/John Unson \nMAGUINDANAO, Philippines – There is new concrete road connecting two agricultural areas in Sultan Kudarat town that will now give Moro peasants access to markets all the time. \nMunicipal officials, Gov. Mujiv Hataman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and his public works secretary, engineer Don Loong, on Friday opened to public use the newly-concreted Banubo-Mulaog Road in Sultan Kudarat. \nThe historic Sultan Kudarat town, located in the first district of Maguindanao, is a bastion of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). \nThe MILF has many members in the municipality that rely mainly on farming as source of income. The group’s main enclave, Camp Darapanan, is located in northwest of Sultan Kudarat. \nThe P13.2-million road was constructed by the municipal government of Sultan Kudarat using a grant from ARMM’s yearly infrastructure subsidy. \nThe project was implemented by the office of Sultan Kudarat Mayor Shameem Mastura via a memorandum of agreement with the Hataman administration, subject to state accounting laws. Nation ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nMore than 2,000 farmers, many of them members of the MILF, stand to benefit from the convenient connectivity now of their farms in Barangays Banubo and Mulaog to places where they sell their harvests. \nThe newly-concreted road was virtually impassable during the rainy days while yet a dirt artery, causing farmers heavy losses due to constraints in transporting their farm products to trading centers on time. \nHataman said the newly-concreted road will be extended within the year to Barangay Sinditan in the same municipality. \nDocuments from state auditors and the Department of Public Works and Highways-ARMM indicated that the Hataman administration implemented 22.3 kilometers of road projects in Sultan Kudarat alone from 2012 to 2016. \nSultan Kudarat is one of the 11 towns in the first district of Maguindanao. \nThe regional government has earmarked P150 million more for the concreting of 12.7 kilometers of farm-to-market roads in the same municipality this year.
