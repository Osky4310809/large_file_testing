It's the highest gas tax in the state. \nNow-former Commissioner Steve Novick held a press conference last week to tout the tax and the list of projects it helps fund. \nLast May, Portlanders narrowly approved the four-year gas tax following a meandering and contentious debate led by former Mayor Charlie Hales and Novick. Novick and Hales crusaded for more revenue for paving and safety projects and originally pushed for a street fee to be paid by residents and businesses. Ultimately, the City Council under Novick's request recommended a 10-cent-a-gallon gas tax. \nIn part because a contractor the state uses to report gasoline tax sales needed to add Portland to its online system. \nPortland still forged ahead with planning for its safety and paving projects. \nSome 56 percent of the gas tax revenue will be spent on paving or repair projects, with the remainder going to safety work, particularly near schools. \n-- Andrew Theen", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:02:32.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
