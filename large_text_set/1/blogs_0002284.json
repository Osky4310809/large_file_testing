One girl was reportedly turned away because her bag was too small, while another was sent home because she had used an eyebrow pencil.

The only acceptable footwear is “plain, black, sturdy leather shoes with wide flat heels” – no trainers, no fabric shoes, no coloured stitching, labels or laces. \nThe only jewellery permitted is a watch with a plain strap and a single pair of small studs worn in the lower lobe of the ear. Makeup is banned, including fake tan, nail varnish or nail extensions, and there are rules for hairbands, hijabs , hair ties and scrunchies. \nHair “must be worn in a simple style”, no shorter than a number two, the uniform code states, adding: “An unnatural striking appearance is inappropriate. If in doubt over whether a planned style would be acceptable, parents/students should contact the academy and seek advice before having the hair styled.” \nColwell, a former police officer, said a letter was sent to parents before Christmas reminding them about uniform policy because of concern that a small number of girls were wearing inappropriate skirts that revealed “lots of thigh”. \nThen, on the first day after the Christmas holiday, “a tiny number” turned up with unsuitable skirts, she said. Those whose parents could show a new skirt was on order were allowed to remain in school; others were offered longer skirts from the school’s second-hand collection, but a small number went home. \n“We are no different from any other school. We just enforce the rules,” said Colwell. “A lot of schools say they have rules, then they don’t enforce them. It’s about the authority of the school. I think it’s important to look smart and to prepare our young people for going out into the world.

A tiny, tiny minority of our parents don’t believe in the rule and authority of the school.” Those that disagreed with the strict rules were entitled to take their children elsewhere, she said. \nEbbsfleet Academy replaced Swan Valley Community School. Last summer 56% of pupils achieved the benchmark of five good GCSEs including English and maths, compared with 24% at the former school, and last term the academy received a positive Ofsted report and was judged “good” in all categories. \nIt is one of a growing number of schools to hit the headlines because of the increasing popularity of a zero-tolerance approach to uniform violations. Last September police were called to Hartsdown academy in the Kent seaside resort of Margate after about 50 pupils were sent home for wearing the wrong clothes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T18:53:35.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
