Lai Mohammed \nHe called for the placement of culture and tourism on the residual list, which has made it difficult to regulate the sector, adding that there was also the lack of “ political will” to develop the sector. \nHe said: “There are several constraints militating against the smooth implementation of the required programmes/ projects. Some of these are inadequate appropriation; delay in the release of funds; cumbersome nature of procurement process; partial release of appropriated amount; late passage of Appropriation Act; placement of culture and tourism on the residual list, which has made it difficult to regulate the sector. \n‘’There is also lack of “ political will” to develop the sector and absence of “ Convention bureau” to attract big time events to Nigeria as a tourism destination.” \nThe Minister told the committee that in 2016, N210, 000,000 was appropriated for the establishment of cultural centres in six states, with same amount released, adding that the expenditure commitment on the projects to date stood at N107,904,175, leaving a balance of N102,095,825. \nMeanwhile, the Senate yesterday described as unacceptable the N620,000 internally generated revenue of the culture sector of the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism for 2016. \nChairman of the committee, Senator Matthew Urhoghide, said: “Budget is not just about expenditure, no one is talking about revenue, we need revenue profile. Each time you come, only expenditure is mentioned, how can you say only N620,000.00 was raised by your ministry from the culture sector. \nLai Mohammed said that for the year 2017, N3,475,975,352 was appropriated as personnel cost, comprising salaries, wages of N3,090,279,077 and social contributions of Pensions and NHIS of N385,696,275. \nHe also said N1,016,507,007 was appropriated in 2017 as over head, an increase of N250 million over 2016 and that the amount proposed as capital for 2017 stood at N750,218,000.00 Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:50:52.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
