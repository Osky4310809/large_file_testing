Luis Gutierrez for refusing to leave an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Chicago on Monday. \nGutierrez was there to attend a meeting between ICE officials and immigration activists, lawyers, community leaders, and elected officials. When the Illinois representative did not get the answers he wanted, however, he decided to stay. \nCheck out this “brave hero”. I was arrested, cuffed then cuffs were cut off. Waiting for further word on if/when we will be arrested. #chiresist pic.twitter.com/vKJRnz6Ebj googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \n— Luis V.
