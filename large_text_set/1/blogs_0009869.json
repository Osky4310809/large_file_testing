By Jeff Dengate   11:04 am \nFor runners in colder climates, the months from December to March usually mean a lot of indoor miles. But running in chilly weather and snow can actually be a lot of fun as long as you have the proper apparel to stay warm. The following dozen pants and tights are proven favorites among our testers. 1/12 Photograph courtesy of Oiselle \nOiselle KC Tights These mostly polyester (with some spandex) women-only tights work in cool conditions but are ideal on a rainy day—they don’t get soggy and droopy when wet. A flat, wide waistband means no irritating pressure on the stomach, and a hidden zippered pocket on the back holds a phone without too much bounce (it sits horizontally at the small of the back). Also, these sleek tights fit seamlessly underneath loose pants, should you need to add a layer on frigid days. $84, amazon.com 2/12 Photograph courtesy of Adidas \nAdidas Climaheat Tights On the coldest days, insulated tights will keep your legs warmer than insulated pants (there’s no room for air to circulate). The fleece lining of these tights works in conjunction with the smooth outer face—the fleece traps air to keep legs warm and the smooth exterior sheds snow. Extra-long ankle zips make them easier to get on and off when you’re done or getting ready to head out. $130, amazon.com ( men’s , women’s ) \n3/12 Photograph courtesy of Asics America \nAsics Thermal Thermopolis Pants These bottoms fit and function like classic track pants: They’re loose enough to pull over tights (or shorts), but are tapered just enough at the ankles to not trip you up on the run. One vast improvement over old-school nylon track pants, however, is the soft, sweat-wicking, and breathable Thermopolis fabric. $80, amazon.com 4/12 Photograph courtesy of Nike \nNike Shield Running Tights With a windproof barrier down the front and a brushed fleece interior, these tights are our go-to when the Polar Vortex sweeps down from Canada. They’re a bit compressive and feel snug—especially if you’re trying to stride out—but totally worth it to stay on the roads in conditions that would force nearly every other runner in search of a treadmill. $90, nike.com ( men’s , women’s ) 5/12 Photograph courtesy of New Balance \nNew Balance Performance Merino Tights Merino wool is nature’s performance fabric—temperature regulating, odor-free, and soft. In these tights, Polartec Power Wool is combined with nylon and spandex to move moisture away from skin quickly, keeping you dry and warm on cold days. $150, amazon.com/newbalance.com ( men’s , women’s ) 6/12 Photograph courtesy of New Balance \nNew Balance x J.Crew Fashion Tight Don’t let the stylish color-blocking fool you, these tights are built for running. They even have stash pockets on each thigh for when her long runs go longer than expected. $95, newbalance.com 7/12 Photograph courtesy of Track Smith \nTracksmith Bislett Pants Modern materials meet retro styling in these loose-fitting track pants. While we like the stirrup strap to keep the pants snug down at the ankles, other runners leave it flapping behind their ankle for a looser fit. A hidden pocket in the side seam is large enough for a phone. $148, tracksmith.com ( men’s , women’s ) 8/12 Photograph courtesy of Lululemon \nLululemon Surge Pant DWR For his wet-weather runs, the durable water repellent (DWR) finish on these track pants will beat back the rain. Droplets bead up on the exterior surface and roll off the fabric, so you’re not clinging to soggy, cold pants. These are also available in tights for $10 less. $118, lululemon.com 9/12 Photograph courtesy of RYU \nRYU Core Pant \nAs cozy as your favorite pair of sweats, these pants might make it difficult to drag yourself off the couch on cold days. But the 100 percent cotton will keep guys moving, though we don’t recommend wearing them if the forecast calls for any rain. $110, shop.ryu.com 10/12 Photograph courtesy of Outdoor Research \nOutdoor Research Centrifuge Pants Built for playing in the backcountry, these weatherproof pants double as a protective layer in blizzards. A polyester layer is laminated over the front fabric to block wind and water, while Polartec Power Grid fleece lines the backside to keep you warm on cold runs while venting excess heat when temps rise. $130, amazon.com ( men’s , women’s ) 11/12 Photograph courtesy of On Running \nOn Running Pants On Running is a relatively newcomer to the States. You may have seen our reviews of the Swiss brand’s unique shoes in recent years. They’ve recently launched a line of carefully crafted apparel, too. The upper legs feature a ripstop nylon that’s coated in a DWR to keep the wind and wet out, while the knees are articulated to let you leg it out during hard runs. The ankles pull snug, and a gusseted panel behind the zippers means the ends aren’t flapping around if you want to leave the zipper partially (or fully) open for a looser fit. $170, on-running.com ( men’s , women’s ) 12/12 Photograph courtesy of RaesWear \nRaesWear Running Tights \nThese USA-made tights have a unique wrap-around pocket in the waistband that’s large enough to stash an iPhone 6 wherever you find it most comfortable. Their style makes them suitable for everything from a gym workout, tempo run, or errand run. $90, raeswear.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T05:45:16.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
