He has pointed out that military officers have stated those jets can operate effectively until 2025, more than enough time for a permanent replacement to be bought.\nRelated Government decides report that questions purchase of interim fighter jets will remain secret Retired RCAF commanders say not enough pilots to fly ‘interim’ fighter jets Liberals plan to buy John Ivison: Liberals’ jet purchase a political solution to political problem of their own making In addition, Defence department officials had earlier warned against buying an interim fighter jet. But the report containing those warnings, which had been on the department’s website for more than a year, was quietly removed after the Liberal government announced its Super Hornet purchase.\nThe Defence Research and Development Canada report recommended against the purchase of such “bridging” aircraft to deal with gaps in capability. “The costs involved with bridging options make them unsuitable for filling capability gaps in the short term,” according to the report. “Any short-term investment results in disproportionately high costs during the bridging period.”\nThe Liberal government has acknowledged the decision to buy the 18 Super Hornets will cost more in the long run but they haven’t provided details on what that amount might be.\nThere is currently no price tag, Sajjan said Tuesday. “Once we have gone through the right process, have all the necessary information, then we’ll have an actual price tag.”\n• Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:22:15.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
