Not only does she (a) know football and (b) look drop-dead gorgeous both in and out of a bikini , she also seems like she really isn’t afraid to enjoy just how freaking good she has it right now.\nNot many people in her position would be so willing to be so willing to share so much of the real them in public forums like social media and well, in front of thousands at places like Super Bowl LI .\nWhich is EXACTLY what she did while Lady Gaga was performing at halftime ( after not really jumping from the roof ).\nCheck out Thompson ABSOLUTELY dancing liking no one was watching with Peter Schrager alongside. Not that you’ll even really notice him, because Charissa is just full-on killing it.\nBetter than anything we'll see on the #GRAMMYs tonight. @CharissaT & @PSchrags own this @ladygaga performance. pic.twitter.com/jgw6jwYRe3 \n— pat muldowney (@patmuldowney) February 13, 2017 \nThis is a woman I would literally pay money to be able to just hang out and party with for one night.\nDear Diary, I am sorry but not sorry. I was sober despite what it looks like and I just hope @PSchrags knows the depth of my gratitude https://t.co/KdhWhjwp3e \n— Charissa Thompson (@CharissaT) February 13, 2017 \n\nLove it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:48:12.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
