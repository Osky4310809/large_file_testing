By: FE Online | Published: March 3, 2017 8:18 PM Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union minister for textiles Smriti Irani. (PTI) \nSenior Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) leader and Union minister for textiles Smriti Irani on Friday took a jibe at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and said that the party is campaigning on the slogan ‘kaam bolta hai’ but in actual ‘karname bolte hai’. She said this in reference to UP minister Gayatri Prajapati case against whom a 16-year-old girl has alleged rape. She further added that the UP CM is not interested in arresting Prajapati. She asked is this an example of Akhilesh’s ‘kamm bolta hai’? She said that it was not their work that was doing the talking, instead ‘Karnaame Bolte Hai’. She said this is clear because it is their own minister and they are not filing an FIR, not recording statements and not bringing this whole issue to justice. \nYou may also like to watch this: \nShe also called the Samajwadi Party family feud a ‘Tamasha’ and said that Akhilesh kept saying his uncle (Shivpal Yadav) is corrupt and he is ‘Mr Clean’. She also said that in Uttar Pradesh life is poor. If a woman is eve-teased or raped there are no chances that anyone will take care of that and ensure justice is carried out as the complaint will never get registered and even if somebody wants to register a complaint and actually manages to compel officials to do so, there are no chances of an investigation being done. \nMeanwhile, explaining the focus of her campaign she said that it has manifold benefit. Smriti said today Uttar Pradesh is not only a concern in terms of law and order but also development, education, job opportunities, manufacturing, infrastructure and agriculture. She said BJP’s promises are on many issues and it will ensure these plans are carried out to change the fate of the state. \nThe state will undergo the sixth phase of assembly elections from tomorrow and the final on March 8.
