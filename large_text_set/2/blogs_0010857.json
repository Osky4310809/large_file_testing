Read More \nThe charity for people with learning disabilities asked the dating site to remove the offending question back in May 2016 but says OkCupid has so far refused to respond to its complaints. \nMencap has now launched a petition, directed at OkCupid CEO Elie Seidman, arguing that \"discrimination is #NotOKCupid.\" \nTogether with its findings, Mencap released a video featuring the reactions of people with a learning disability to the 'deeply upsetting' question. Undateables star Kate was upset by the question (Photo: Mencap) \nThe clip features some familiar faces from the Channel 4 show 'The Undateables', a reality documentary which follows people with learning disabilities as they try to find love. \nKate, who has Downs Syndrome, said: \"I feel quite upset even answering the question... I think it should be taken down.\" \nShe continued: \"There may be someone in the future that could fulfill that gap in my life, in my heart. \n\"I would love to get married, one day I would love to have a kid.\" \nAnother star says: “It’s an insult. Everybody’s got the chance to be with someone.” Read More Was this First Dates' most awkward moment EVER?

This question would never be directed at another group of people and by using it OkCupid are cutting out a whole group of people and labelling us as without the same basic rights as everyone else.” \n\"As a person with a learning disability and someone who is married and may want a family in the future I find OkCupids refusal to take this question down discriminatory and disgusting. \n\"I wrote to OkCupid’s CEO last May asking if the question could be taken down but had no reply. \n\"Everyone deserves a chance to find love and I hope OkCupid take notice and finally delete this unacceptable question from their website and start to make sure their website is open and welcoming to people from all backgrounds.\" Millions of people turn to online dating to find love \nOkCupid users are also invited to respond to a number of queries which explore a variety of issues ranging from their \"relationship with marijuana\" to whether they prefer cuddling in the \"big spoon\" or \"little spoon\" position. \nHowever, men and women are also asked a series of highly inflammatory questions designed to expose their attitudes to abortion, homosexuality, gun ownership and even whether it's acceptable to burn their country's flag. \nOkCupid has been contacted for comment. \nSpeaking last year, a spokesman said: \"Our question system is designed to help potential matches understand the interests and values of other users. \n\"Questions range from mundane to provocative and they specifically allow you to determine your potential compatibility with someone else and to avoid people whose viewpoints you strongly disagree with.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:22:26.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
