The public works spokesperson said a pipe under the roadway allowed the creek to flow on either side of the road.\nBecause of the unrelenting rain, the water pressure was too forceful washed out the entire two-lane roadway.\nThere was no immediate estimation on when the road would be repaired, with a statement from the county administrator’s office saying the road would be closed indefinitely.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:30:52.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
