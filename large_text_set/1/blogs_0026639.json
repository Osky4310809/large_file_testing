Remembered as one of the league’s unluckiest players, Young pitched his way into MLB record books by dropping 27 straight decisions as both a starter and a reliever with the Mets from 1992-93. While he did register 12 saves over 23 scoreless innings, he also made 27 starts that ended in no-decisions, making him winless for just over two years from 1992-94.\nThe Mets traded Young and his 5-35 record to the Cubs in 1994 for shortstop Jose Vizcaino. Young played two seasons in Chicago before ending his career with his hometown team, the Astros, in 1996.\nYoung, 51, is beloved by baseball fans not for his statistics but for his ability not to take them too seriously. He embraced the comic fallout of his playing days, saving the good-luck charms fans sent him over the years and even making an appearance on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” in 1993.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T03:02:42.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
