We are in a global world with a very mobile population. \n“As a government, it’s our desire to reduce the amount of money spent on foreign education and by the time we are able to raise the standard of education in Nigeria, there would be less crave for western education in Africa” \nBank-Olemoh continued; “Foreign education is good, because it expands your scope, but the need to invest in quality education in Africa is critical for us. It is good to see Nigerians traveling abroad to be educated and coming back and impact Nigeria.
