Bipin Rawat told soldiers in a speech at Sunday’s Army Day celebrations in New Delhi.\nMore In Indian Army Indian Soldiers Invent New Saints to Maintain Their Sanity Almost a Week After Being Buried in Avalanche, Indian Soldier Is Found Alive \nOne of the videos was viewed more than 9 million times on Facebook. A day after it was posted on Jan. 8, India’s Home Minister Rajnath Singh said an inquiry into the matter had been launched.\nI have seen a video regarding a BSF jawan's plight. I have asked the HS to immediately seek a report from the BSF & take appropriate action.\n— Rajnath Singh (@rajnathsingh) January 9, 2017 \nThe video was followed by other snippets of men who said they were Indian Army soldiers and also listed complaints.\nIn one video on YouTube, a man who said his name was Ram Bhagat and that he worked as a nursing assistant at a military-run hospital in the northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, complained about insufficient food and exploitation of soldiers by their seniors.\n\n“Many people are just walking officer’s dogs,” he said in the video. Mr. Bhagat also complained about the lack of transport facilities for soldiers, while he alleged that the families of senior officers were given vehicles even if they had to visit a “beauty parlor.”\nIn other videos, men who said they were Indian Army soldiers spoke about being “exploited” by senior officers to “polish shoes, walk dogs” and clean officers’ cars.\nA spokesman for the Indian Army couldn’t immediately be reached for a comment on the allegations made in the videos.\nOn Sunday, Mr. Rawat, the chief of army staff said that such testimonies affect the morale of soldiers who are posted along the country’s tense borders and that they should get in touch with him directly.\n“I have issued orders that in the army headquarters we will have a chief of army staff suggestions-cum-grievances box placed at various places,” he said in a news conference last week. Similar boxes will also be placed at the Army’s command headquarters and other units, he added.\nMr. Rawat said that the identities of soldiers who make suggestions or air grievances would be protected before action is taken.\n“If dissatisfied, they can use other means,” he said.\nFor breaking news, features and analysis from India, follow WSJ India on Facebook .\nShare this: Army Chief Bipin Rawat Border Security Force China Corruption Food India Indian Army Pakistan Social Media Soldiers Tej Bahadur Yadav Previous Family Asks Indian Court to Allow Woman to Take Last-Resort Tuberculosis Drug", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T16:02:56.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
