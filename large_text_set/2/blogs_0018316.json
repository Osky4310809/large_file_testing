The shake-up offers one solution to a series of discussions about improving the pace of play and duration of games, which also included proposals to raise the strike zone, install pitch clocks and limit trips to the pitcher’s mound.\nThe league estimates removing the pitcher’s four meaningless lobs to the plate would cut down about a minute of dead time for each walk. Although the game has seen a decline in intentional walks over the years, with one every 2.6 games last season, the MLB decided to go with practicality over tradition.\nCommissioner Rob Manfred declined to comment Tuesday on the specifics of the negotiations.\n“There’s a variety of changes that can be undertaken,” he said. “I’m committed to the idea that we have a set of proposals out there and we continue to discuss those proposals in private.”\nWhile Manfred spoke positively of the game’s prospects, he also acknowledged the need for adjustments in a new era.\n“I’ve tried to be clear that our game is fundamentally sound, that it does not need to be fixed as some people have suggested,” he said at a news conference Tuesday, “and I think last season was the kind of demonstration of the potential of our league to captivate the nation and of the game’s unique place in American culture.\n“I believe it’s a mistake to stick our head in the sand and ignore the fact that our game has changed and continues to change.”\nWith AP \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:55:44.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
