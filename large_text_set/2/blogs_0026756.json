Samsung’s RCS service is a complete end-to-end solution that includes RCS-enabled devices, native/downloadable device clients, cloud-based RCS application servers, an interconnectivity hub among operators and a third-party monetization platform. \n\nUsers will enjoy rich messaging features such as group chats, video calls and large file transfers, while continuing to use their phone numbers without the need for an additional app. \n\nSamsung’s RCS cloud will allow mobile network operators to quickly launch the service and avoid the costly and time-consuming efforts of building their own network infrastructure. Additionally, Samsung’s RCS hub will support and simplify the interconnectivity among other RCS-enabled operators, Samsung and third-party RCS clouds, allowing for the same service ubiquity for users as SMS and MMS. \n\nSamsung’s RCS solution is compliant with the latest GSMA RCS specifications. As a standards-based solution, it will be a true messaging evolution post SMS/MMS, making it possible to achieve a global footprint very quickly. \n\n“We are very excited to be expanding Samsung’s RCS messaging service,” said Yunsang Park, SVP of the Product Service Innovation Strategy Group, Mobile Communications   “With this new offering, mobile customers will have a rich messaging experience built directly into their phones. Our new RCS solution, along with our supporting mobile network operator partners, will make it easier for hundreds of millions of users across the globe to access RCS messaging. We are grateful for our partners’ support and look forward to expanding our network in the future.” \n\nSamsung is cooperating with several network provider partners to advance the availability of RCS messaging, including Deutsche Telekom, KT, SK Telecom, T-Mobile and Vodafone. To suit each partner’s specific needs, the solution is offered not only as a full packaged partnership but also in a variety of modular options. More partners are expected to join in the near future. \n\n“The GSMA aligned the mobile industry behind a single, Universal Profile for advanced RCS messaging and we have already seen a number of significant operator launches,” said Alex Sinclair, Chief Technology Officer, GSMA. “This approach gives consumers a richer and more consistent messaging experience regardless of device or network. We look forward to seeing the profile become the de facto industry standard in the near future.” \n\nThe RCS solution will be supported by Samsung smartphones running Android Marshmallow or later. \n\nThe RCS demo will also be showcased at the Samsung booth (Hall 3) at Mobile World Congress from February 27 to March 2, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T12:28:16.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
