A stray bullet struck Takiya in the head. \nCommunity Activist Andrew Holmes, a distant cousin of Takiya’s, said there is a $3,000 reward for information leading to her shooter. \nAbout 30 minutes before Takiya was shot on Saturday, 12-year-old girl was shot in the head in West Englewood. \nKanari Gentry-Bowers was playing basketball with friends at the corner of 57th and Winchester, around 7:15 p.m. Saturday when a car pulled up and someone inside started shooting. Kanari was shot in the neck. \nKanari remained on life support Tuesday morning at Stroger Hospital. Her family also was struggling with the decision of whether to pull her off life support. \nNo one was in custody for either shooting Tuesday morning.
