It goes from four cells to about four million cells. \nThe process you see takes about 33 hours, but it’s sped up to fit in a 23-second video . Because science doesn’t always adapt to human attention spans. \nThose 23 seconds include more mind-blowing science than anything you’ll ever find at the Creation Museum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:05:35.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
