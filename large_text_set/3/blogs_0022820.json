Congrats! This prelude to moving in together comes with many romantic conveniences. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with extra closet space. \nThing is, you probably aren’t maximizing the space you have. Here’s a rundown on how to optimize your closet. If you can use a drill and a level, you can make this work. Advertisement Step One: Take Stock of the Situation A post shared by dor (@dormantzur) on Jan 28, 2017 at 5:16am PST \nWhat is in your closet, anyway? We’re talking about the one in your bedroom. Is it full of clothes? Power tools? How about hockey equipment? \nIf you have a coat closet or a broom closet, move some of the non-clothing junk there. If you haven’t played hockey since the Wayne Gretzky era, donate that goalie mask to Goodwill. \nYou’ll be left with the things that actually need to go in your closet: pants, jackets, shirts, shoes. Count the pairs of shoes. Take note of anything long you need to hang up—for you, that means coats; for her, it might mean a long dress or two. Now you’re ready to plan. Step Two: Use Your Height A post shared by Derrick Whitten (@dkwhitten) on Mar 18, 2017 at 7:47pm PDT \nThe most frequently wasted space in closets? Vertical space. But you’re a strapping giant, so use it. Every inch of it. \nMost closets will come with one bar at about five feet from the floor. But almost nothing on your hangers is five feet long. And almost all closets have about seven feet of headspace. That means you can put two bars in there. \nGet out the screw gun. Take that bar off the wall. You can easily buy a second one and the mounting hardware online or at Home Depot. Space them so that whatever’s on each can hang free. You’ve just doubled your closet. Which means you can give her at least part of the lower bar. Step Three: Keep It Flexible A post shared by Commercial Real Estate Brokers (@rocrealtygroup) on Jul 12, 2015 at 12:21pm PDT \nOkay, so hanging bars aren’t everything. If you’ve ever shopped for a closet system, you’ve probably been tempted by custom “solutions.” What about a pant rack? Sock baskets? Tie cubbies? \nIn one of her books, the great organizing goddess Marie Kondo has a chapter titled “Storage experts are hoarders.” Why? Because installing all kinds of specialty racks and dividers is an insidious form of clutter. \nIf you put everything you can on hangers and hang them on bars, you can reconfigure endlessly. Add a few shelves for folded clothing and anything in containers. For your socks? Get a dresser. Step Four: What About Shoes? A post shared by Haven (@havenhome.la) on Jul 15, 2016 at 12:04pm PDT \nOkay, so besides the stuff you hang, your closet needs to accommodate your shoes. You could get one of those over-the-door things with the pockets, but they can have trouble holding shoes in men’s sizes. The best advice? Think shelving. \nInstall a shelf above the highest bar, and use it for shoes you rarely wear—like tux shoes, and snowboard boots. Or install a shelf eight inches off the ground. You can tuck several pairs of shoes underneath and line them up on top—potentially in two rows. Wherever you find space for it, simple shelves spaced just far enough apart are the best bet. Step Five: Use Every Single Space \nYour closet isn’t maximized until every cubic foot has a purpose. In a typical closet, that means don’t forget the sides. In a walk-in, it means using the space at the end. A post shared by Phoenix MacLaren (@pmaclaren) on Mar 14, 2017 at 11:47pm PDT \nNon-walk-ins may have more horizontal hanging space than you need. If you’re the kind of handyman who can frame things in with plywood, you can claim space on either side of your central hanging area. Use it for shoe cubbies. Or luggage. Or, okay, your hockey sticks. A post shared by Matija Karmelic (@matijakarmelic) on Apr 11, 2016 at 6:34am PDT \nIf you’ve been blessed with a walk-in, don’t forget that wall at the end. You could waste it on a tie rack, or use it for shelves that can hold more shoes or folded sweaters. In the deep hanging space on either side, hang up clothes that aren’t currently in rotation, like off-season jackets. \nIn the end, you look smarter, know where everything is, and you’ve even discovered some extra space. Now, do you need a few more shirts?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:02:02.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
