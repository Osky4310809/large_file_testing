Took out Silva with a brutal challenge, given hard night. \nStones 6 \nHad been getting much better, but this was a step backwards for him.

City need to replace him asap. \nClichy 5 \nUsed to be good as attacking threat, now even that has gone. Very poor. \nFernandinho 6 \nGiven a thankless task of being the only defensive minded midfielder. \nSilva 7 \nWore the armband on his 50th Champions League game, better second half. \nDe Bruyne 6 \nBooked. Frustrating first half but got better. great pass in build up to the goal.

City’s best player. \nAguero 6 \nCould not take advantage of three big openings. Wasteful in attack.
