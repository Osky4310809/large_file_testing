Credit Yoan Valat/European Pressphoto Agency PARIS — France ’s interior minister, Bruno Le Roux, announced on Tuesday that he was stepping down, after a financial prosecution office said it was opening a preliminary investigation into parliamentary jobs he gave to his daughters. Mr. Le Roux said he had done nothing wrong as he announced his resignation at a news conference in Bobigny, northeast of Paris. But, he said, he was resigning so as not to distract from “the daily fight against terrorism, against crime.” Under French law, it is not illegal for members of Parliament to hire their family members as aides, provided that the work is genuine. It is a common practice, yet it is increasingly perceived as a sign of the widening gap between the political elite and the French people. A similar scandal has engulfed the campaign of François Fillon, a presidential candidate from the center-right Republican Party, since the end of January, after a satirical newspaper reported that he had hired his wife and children as parliamentary assistants over the years and paid them with public money for possibly bogus jobs. Mr. Fillon, once considered the front-runner to be the next president, was charged last week with embezzlement. He has plummeted in opinion polls since the scandal and is now lagging behind the far-right leader, Marine Le Pen of the National Front, and the centrist Emmanuel Macron, who is an independent.

Calls for Mr. Le Roux to step down came from Mr. Fillon’s ranks as well as from within Mr. Le Roux’s party, the Socialists. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “We can’t tell François Fillon, ‘Step down, be an example’ and have the head of a ministry — what’s more, a sovereign one — not apply this to himself,” Benoît Hamon, the Socialist candidate in the presidential election, said at a news conference in Brussels.
