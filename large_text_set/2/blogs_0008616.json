But yesterday, when he criticized Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka's fashion line, he crossed a line. \nHe originally tweeted from his personal handle, @realDonalTrump. But then, he—or another White House employee—used the official @POTUS handle to retweet this comment. This may seem like a small distinction, but according to legal expert Kathleen Clark, it is not trivial: He was deliberately invoking the power of the government to benefit his daughter's company. \nIt's the difference between Donald Trump writing a note on a scrap of paper and writing a note on official White House stationary , or making a comment in the privacy of a dinner party and making a statement behind the White House podium. \"This is about using government resources and government symbols,\" Clark says. \nWhile Congress is unlikely to call him out on this, the Nordstrom tweet could be used as part of a larger case about how Trump is abusing government power. \nRead my full story here . America’s self-image is the worst it’s been since the Iraq war \nA new national survey from Gallup finds that Americans believe the rest of the world sees the U.S. more unfavorably (57%) than favorably (42%), a reversal from a year ago, and their worst assessment of the country's image in a decade. \nThese results are from a Gallup survey conducted Feb. 1-5, about two weeks into Donald Trump's presidency. The 42% favorable rating is one of the lowest since Gallup began asking this question in 2000 and may be attributable to the election of Trump, whose sometimes controversial statements and actions have rankled several world leaders. However, Americans' perceptions of the image of the U.S. abroad were marginally worse in 2007, when 40% thought the world viewed the nation favorably. At the time, the U.S. was embroiled in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and President George W. Bush was highly unpopular… The high-water mark for Americans believing the U.S. is viewed favorably was 79% in 2002, in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. \nThe survey, of a random sample of 1,035 U.S. adults, also found that overall satisfaction with the direction of the country is at 30%, which is up from 26% last month. Notably, Republicans are much more confident about the future of the United States than Democrats are: 55% of Republicans said they're satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S., which is up from 22% last month . Only 13% of Democrats are satisfied, down from 27% before the inauguration. george w. bush Seize the day!
