Most women will demand my head for daring to ask such a question. But ask it I must, given last week’s drama in Tamil Nadu. Had I asked myself the same question a decade ago, my answer would have been instant and unequivocal: “Of course! Definitely. Women are natural-born politicians.” Today, I am taking back those words. Women, I hate to admit, simply don’t have the stomach for this dirty game called politics.\nDirty, it is. And a game, too. I say this not because women refuse to play dirty games or are morally superior to men. It’s just that historically they have less experience in this department. Power, as is understood and administered in the modern world, is still a predominantly male domain. Women who step into this murky arena, have powerful men as their role models and colleagues. Soon they become quasi-men themselves. They clone the worst traits of alpha male behaviour and in the bargain are neither here nor there.\nNot for nothing was Indira Gandhi admiringly referred to as ‘the only man in the Cabinet’. It was meant as a compliment. But what it actually said was that she had become a ruthless tyrant, like some of the men around her. It also suggested she had emasculated her colleagues.\nYES, MADAM PM: Indira Gandhi, the ‘goongi gudiya’, was later described as ‘the only man in the Cabinet’. It was meant as a compliment but wasn’t\nSasikala and Jayalalithaa are prime examples of women who ding-donged between playing archetypal women — obsessed by sarees, jewellery, sandals, gold, and in Jayalalithaa’s case, that peculiar cape to hide her girth — and hard-bargaining despots displaying conventional male traits. Sasikala’s over-dramatic display of emotion at her mentor Amma’s memorial, as she was being taken to prison, is another example of how differently men and women respond to such a crisis.\nTypically, her male counterpart would have visited the memorial and milked the opportunity as a photo-op, without making such a spectacle of himself. Sasikala thumping/slapping the memorial reduced herself to just another untutored, hysterical woman. She became ‘ordinary’ in an instant. Rural ladies are known to beat their breasts and tear their hair out to express rage, grief, frustration. Urban women keep a stiff upper lip in India — it is deemed more civilised and sophisticated.\nCheck: Sonia Gandhi at her husband’s funeral. She was a picture of stoic composure and dignity. So she has remained ever since. Nobody knows what the hell ‘madam’ is thinking or feeling. Ditto for ‘Amma’ who was smart enough to camouflage whatever was going through her mind. Poor Sasikala gave the game away with those three slaps on a hard stone platform.\nWomen are up against multiple prejudices. The day they step into politics they become marked individuals. And the games begin. They are rarely given their due as intelligent strategists. Instead, they are called conniving, cunning bitches. No matter what decisions they take, those are criticised and, worse, personalised. They are rarely described as ‘selfless patriots’ unless they happen to be single and aged. An attractive woman in politics becomes the softest target.\nHer appearance is analysed, scrutinised and torn to shreds. Either she is dubbed frumpy or mocked for wearing the ‘wrong’ attire. Men’s sartorial flourishes are called ‘stylish’. Women who take the trouble to match sarees and accessories are called ‘vain’. If they speak up, they are criticised for being unattractive and aggressive. If they stay mum, they are reduced to ‘goongi gudiyas’. A shrewd woman is called an ace manipulator. A shrewd man is hailed as a smart guy.\nIncredible survival strategies are needed for men and women to hang in there and succeed. Women start off with a huge disadvantage — just being women! The army does not take a woman commander-in-chief seriously. Why, even in the corporate space, so many men confess they don’t like taking orders from women.\nWhen women jump into politics, most assume they are there by default (often true), standing in for a dead father, husband, brother. To prove themselves, they have to invest precious energy into establishing their credentials as competent leaders before they can get on with the business at hand.\nIt will be interesting to see if Sasikala will try to remote control E Palaniswami from her prison cell. It’s all about the money, and keeping the seat warm for her. What are three, four or even five years behind bars? Sasikala is 61. She will still be considered young enough to lead the party when she completes her jail term. No matter how our narrative pans out, take a look at global women politicians today. What do you see? I see wrecks.\nWe don’t have to punish ourselves by being as foolish as men. Leave that dirty profession to those better suited for it, ladies. Focus on a far superior life goal for yourselves. Why? Because “you are worth it!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:47:38.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
