King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 11 hours ago 4 \nLinkin Park vocalist Mike Shinoda said he's very excited about taking risks on the band's upcoming new album. \nHe noted about the follow-up to 2014's \" The Hunting Party \": \"One thing that I am super excited about - I really want to make the riskiest songs now. I feel we're at the point where we've handled so many things, and risky can be a lot of different kinds of risky. \n\"Risky can be the weirdest things - weirdest chord progressions or whatever - or it can be the poppiest thing that comes to mind that we just made work and sound very cool. I wanna make some songs that make you go, 'Holy shit!'. We gotta find that.\" \nPreviously discussing the essence of the new record, guitarist Brad Nelson said: \"I think it's a personal record. I don't think it's about politics, the world outside - a lot of these songs are personal, I feel like the person singing is speaking directly to me in a revealing way. There's an intimacy, but it's not introverted.\" \nVocalist Chester Bennington chimed in: \"There are songs that don't talk about a specific situation, they talk about a frame of thinking. This is the shit that's going on inside my head or something I'm dealing with; to me, it tells a story but it's also revealing as well, and that feels honest to me.\" \n\"We're trying to connect with people. We're trying to make a record that has stellar songs that people want to listen to all the time.\" \nYou can check out a brief musical sample the guys posted below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:01:57.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
