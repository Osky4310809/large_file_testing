According to The Wrap, Turner CEO John Martin recently revealed that a plan is in the works for Conan to switch from a nightly show to a weekly hourlong show, though an exact date for the change has not been announced. \nIn addition to all the late night competition, Martin pointed out that O’Brien’s found the most success through his remote specials in recent years. While the new format will undoubtedly give O’Brien and his writers more time to make quality episodes, O’Brien has been a weekday late night mainstay since he started at NBC’s Late Night back in 1993, so the change would be big one. Still, over 23 years is a long time to do a talk show every night, and speaking to The Washington Post last year, O’Brien called all the late night competition “liberating” and seemed excited to mix things up. \n———– \nConan used to be awesome. These days I try to watch his show every now and then, but he just doesn’t have the same pizazz. Doesn’t bring the same heat. Sometimes it’s just downright unwatchable. For shame too, because when he was on after Leno on NBC he was fantastic. But then Leno shit all over his career, sent him packing to TBS, and he just hasn’t been the same since. \nSo after 23 years of doing a show every night, he is switching over the once a week, hourly show format that has seen much success from people like Samantha Bee and John Oliver as of late. This change will allow Conan to work harder on more long-form bits, which he is awesome at. It’ll just be a nice breath of fresh air, as he’s been getting beat down and dragged by guys like Fallon the last few years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T03:56:39.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
