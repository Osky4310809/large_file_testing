(Photo: David Bornfriend, AP) \nMoonlight , the Golden Globe-winning and Oscar-nominated coming-of-age film about a gay youth, has just one rival, Star Trek Beyond , in its category in the annual GLAAD Media Award nominations. \nThe nominations, announced Tuesday, show progress and obstacles in terms of fair, bold and consequential depictions of LGBTQ people in the media, tracked by GLAAD, the leading media advocacy organization for that community. \nOn the one hand, the nominations show that for the first time in more than a decade, a popular category — outstanding film in wide release — has just two nominees, reflecting the need for more progress in that area, GLAAD says. In years past, there were at least five nominees. \nMoonlight has received rave reviews and eight Oscar nominations, including for best picture, director, supporting actors and music. Star Trek Beyond , the latest in the rebooted franchise, shows the Sulu character as gay and with a partner. \nBut two other categories, outstanding music artist and outstanding comic book, were expanded from five nominees to 10 nominees each, reflecting increased inclusion in those media. \nAnd the GLAAD nominations suggest TV has done a better job of bringing gay and transgender stories to audiences: There are 10 nominees each in the TV comedy and drama series categories. \n\"At a time when progress is at a critical juncture, it is imperative that Hollywood tell more LGBTQ stories that reflect the community’s rich diversity, and build understanding that brings all communities closer together,\" said GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis in a statement. \"This year's nominees have created images and storylines that challenge misconceptions and broaden understanding, accelerating acceptance and equality for LGBTQ people across the globe.\" \nGLAAD announced 115 nominees in 21 English-language categories and 41 Spanish-language nominees in 11 categories. In the English-language categories, cable networks earned 31 nominations (HBO led with five), and broadcast networks garnered 17 nominations (ABC led with six). Streaming services received seven nominations (Netflix led with four). \nZoe Saldana as Uhura and John Cho as Sulu in 'Star Trek Beyond,' nominated for a GLAAD Media Award.

All of the nominees in the outstanding reality program category include transgender people. Other nominees featuring transgender people include: Transparent , Shameless , The Fosters , The OA , Modern Family ; plus Laura Jane Grace and her band Against Me! who are nominated for their album Shape Shift With Me . \nThe GLAAD Media Awards ceremonies will be held in Los Angeles on April 1, 2017, and in New York on May 6. \nAlso, Comcast’s Xfinity LGBTQ Film & TV Collection has announced more than 100 titles of GLAAD Media Awards-related content will be available for viewing on television, web and mobile devices.
