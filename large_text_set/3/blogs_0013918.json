Philstar.com/File \nMANILA, Philippines (Updated 6:15 p.m.) — MANILA, Philippines — The leadership of the House of Representatives on Wednesday night removed members who voted against the death penalty bill early this month from key positions. In a surprising move, House Majority Rodolfo Fariñas declared the posts of representatives who went against the order of the House leader to support the bill reimposing death penalty vacant. Removed from leadership positions in the House majority were: Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Carlos Zarate Gabriela party-list Rep. Emmi De Jesus Buhay party-list Rep. Mariano Michael Velarde Jr. ACT-Teachers party-list Rep. Antonio Tinio Amin party-list Rep. Sitti Hataman Sorsogon Rep. Evelina Escudero Dinagat Islands Rep. Kaka Bag-ao. House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said earlier Wednesday that the reshuffle in the House leadership positions would happen in May, when Congress returns from its break. \nSpeaking to reporters at the House of Representatives, Alvarez said the House majority would not forget the policy announced before voting on House Bill 4727 or the death penalty bill. \n“Ay, hindi makakalimutan dahil we have asked the respective parties to submit their nominees for the replacements,” he said. \nAlvarez also declared that he was willing to “burn bridges” with his decision. \n“Well if I’m burning bridges then so be it wala tayo magagawa diyan,” he said. \nThat time, Alvarez said that representatives occupying committee chairmanship and deputy speakership positions who would vote against the death penalty measure would lose their key positions .   \n“Tuloy na tuloy 'yun. 'Yun ang naging policy natin kaya kailangan nating gawin 'yun,\" Alvarez said in a radio interview when asked if they would follow through on the warning. \nWith 217 voting in favor and 54 against, the House passed the bill on third reading on March 7 . \nA day after the vote, Alvarez reissued his warning, but this time he dialed back a bit , saying that the changes in the composition of the House leadership would happen some other time and that he was leaving it to Fariñas how to effect the reshuffle, a move that was criticized and scored by some members in the minority. \nAlbay Rep. Edcel Lagman, who is not in the majority and who voted against the measure, described the threat of Alvarez as “mere scheming braggadocio.” \nLagman said: “The threat of Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez to oust those who would vote against the death penalty bill from their key leadership positions has turned out to be a mere scheming braggadocio.” \nAlvarez said that the House leadership would consider whom each party would nominate as replacements. \n“Kung ano yung ino-nominate nila kung sino yun of course we will consider,” he said. \nHe also added even those who were absent would be removed from their posts, unless they had a valid reason.
