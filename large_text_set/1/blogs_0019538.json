Stab victim: Kyle Maher (PA) \nMr Maher had announced his engagement on Facebook days earlier. \nForensic officers on Sunday night remained at the scene at his flatshare in Drakefield Road, Tooting, south London after the stabbing at 3am on Saturday. \nLuke McGarrett, a cousin, paid tribute to Mr Maher describing him as the “perfect father figure” for his new daughter, who was born last year to a former partner. \nThe 22-year-old told the Standard: “All he wanted was the chance to raise his baby girl, she was his diamond in the sky. \n“He absolutely adored her and would spend all the money he had on her just to make her happy - even if he was left skint. \n“She had just begun to walk and was learning how to say ‘daddy’ but now she will never see him again. \n“I’ve visited his partner in hospital and she is traumatised, she is going to needs lots of support. Man stabbed to death in quiet south London road \n“His mother is distraught. Since he was born Kyle has been her baby boy, her only boy. She keeps thinking he is going to call her on the phone and it’s all been a misunderstanding. \n“I saw him in the morgue and held his cold hand and said ‘Get some rest, I’ll see you soon.’” \nThe house is split into five flats, and is thought to be run by a charity which supports homeless and vulnerable people to live in decent homes. Mr Maher had lived in a room in the house for just under a year. \nNeighbours on the road were woken by muffled shouts, loud banging of doors and a woman in “hysterics” with cut arms in the early hours of Saturday morning. \nThe teenager remains in hospital where her condition is not believed to be life-threatening. \nShe posted a tribute on Facebook from her hospital bed, reading: “I love you. Rest in peace baby, I’ll always think of you everyday and we are all here thinking of you and I will fight your corner. I’m so proud of you, my strong soldier. Love you so much, just wish you [were] here.” \nAnyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 020 8721 4868 or via 101. They can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. \nRichard Wilson-Michael, 29, of Drakefield Road, SW17, will appear in custody at Bromley Magistrates’ court on January 23 charged with the murder, GBH and possession of an offensive weapon.
