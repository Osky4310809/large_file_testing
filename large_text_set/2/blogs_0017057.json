It is a part of Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency in the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh. By: FE Online | Published: February 21, 2017 12:35 PM Gorakhpur Rural is constituency No. 323 of the Uttar Prasesh legislative assembly. It is a part of Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency in the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh. (Source: PTI) \nPolitically crucial Uttar Pradesh recently drove into its third out of the seven-phased Assembly election with a voter turnout of 61.16 per cent. 69 constituencies went for polling on February 19 on more than 25,600 seats. The 12 districts that went for polling on February 19 included Farrukhabad, Kanpur city, Unnao, Lucknow, Etawah, Hardoi, Kannauj, Barabanki, Auraiyya, Sitapur, Mainpuri and Kanpur rural. The political waves are all heated up in the state and high-decibel rallies are being conducted by leading political parties running in fray to gain majority in the state. The ongoing assembly polls are very crucial for the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) and the UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is leaving no stones unturned to make sure he retain the power. Though this time there is no ‘Modi wave’ like it was during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) backing on its star campaigner PM Narendra Modi has successfully managed to create a decent preference across some casts and communities. However, the incumbent CM, with his ‘kaam bolta hai’ campaign, has emerged as a leader of the youth on its own. But there has been a little anger against him because of the law-and-order failure in the state. The chief ministerial face of BJP in Up has not been announced yet, but the saffron party is confident about forming government with full majority. BJP has blamed SP of acting as a roadblock to the development of the state for years. \nMayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has made the contest a high-octane three way battle. However, she has been struggling to increase her vote bank apart from some particular communities. Even the votes of Muslim community have gone to her in limited areas where the candidates fielded are very strong. With such high voter turnout in all the three phases of the polls so far, it clearly indicates that the electorate is turning out to vote to effect a major change. \nGorakhpur Rural is constituency No. 323 of the Uttar Prasesh legislative assembly. It is a part of Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency in the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh. \nNumber of voters Gorakhpur Rural constituency had a total of 3,38,264 registered electorates out of which 1,90,178 were male and 1.48,086 female registered voters. \nWhat are the key issues Development, educated and employment are some key issues in the region of the state. \nWho was the winner last time BJP won this seat by a margin of 16, 985 votes during the 2012 Assembly elections. Vijay Bahadur Yadava from BJP bagged a total of 58,849 votes followed by Jafar Amin Dakku from SP who got 41,864 votes. The voter turnout was 52.1 per cent. \nYou might also want to see this: \nWho are the competing candidates Bipin Singh (BJP), Vijay Bahadur Yadav (SP), Rajesh Pandey (BSP) and Gulab Chandra Yadav (RLD). \nWhy this constituency is important? BJP won the 2012 assembly elections here, but this time waves are different. BJP’s decision to field a new candidate was not accepted by the supports. The saffron party seems unstable while SP faction has been successfully able to lure voters. Many candidates of the leading party have resigned and decided to fight independently.
