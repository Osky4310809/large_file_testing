We took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alerted federal officials of this finding,” said Mike Kanarick, spokesperson for Burlington Electric in a statement posted online .\nBurlington Electric is working with federal officials to trace how the code got into the laptop.\nSo did the Russians attack a laptop at a public utility, even if it wasn’t connected to the electric grid?\nIt’s possible, but not certain.\nThe malware found was certainly Russian made and related to the malware used to infiltrate the DNC. But that does not mean that it was used by Russians.\nMalware, like any software, is bought and sold. It is not necessarily used by the same people who craft it.\nWhat’s crucial is that we don’t even know if the code was intended to disrupt the utility, or if hackers just wanted to test if they could penetrate the system. We also don't know when the malware infected the laptop.\n1) Not an infiltration of the power grid.\n2) \"Russian\" malware can be purchased online by anyone.\n3) See 1 & 2. https://t.co/bVIG8zQBsk\n— Dell Cameron (@dellcam) December 31, 2016\nAn actual attack on an electrical grid has occurred in another part of the world—Ukraine.\nIn 2015, a well-known piece of malware called BlackEnergy was used as part of an expertly coordinated attack that shut off power for an estimated 250,000 people (but only for several hours.)\nUkraine’s intelligence community has vehemently blamed Russia for the attack, though it has not offered concrete proof to bolster its accusation. Given the political tension between the two nations, the accusation is not unrealistic, but there still is no smoking gun.\nWhile the idea of foreign hackers targeting the national electrical grid in the United States is certainly scary, there’s no evidence that it has already occurred, at least not in Vermont.\nThere is, of course, a serious risk to the electrical grid from a cyberattack, but that threat isn’t as worrisome as policymakers, cybersecurity firms and others sometimes make it seem.\nAfter all, squirrels wreak much more havoc on our electrical grid than hackers all the time.\nBONUS: Signs Your Friend Just Watched A TED Talk", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/29/us/politics/document-Report-on-Russian-Hacking.htmlhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/29/us/politics/document-Report-on-Russian-Hacking.html", "https://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-malware-that-led-to-the-ukrainian-blackout", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/pYYPX6zP.m3u8", "https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/pYYPX6zP.jpg", "https://t.co/XwP4Y8vYY6", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4-FnNwp9cdjmLAO8kThEO1ORXq4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F333444%2Fd0952591-dded-4b1a-8992-5a61ec2e8ff4.png", "http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/31/the-threat-to-americas-electrical-grid-is-much-bigger-than-you-can-possibly-imagine-cyberwar-squirrels-rodents-hackers/", "https://t.co/R24rX7hcqi", "https://t.co/wEIdFrSGIy", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FoYeVEd3507dzaU1-b_1dw2fXoU=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F333444%2Fd0952591-dded-4b1a-8992-5a61ec2e8ff4.png", "https://t.co/bVIG8zQBsk", "https://twitter.com/dellcam/status/815043480741408768", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fburlingtonelectric%2Fposts%2F1397784386912233%3A0&width=500", "https://twitter.com/ericgeller/status/815026196631195648", "https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/news/3910/Burlington-Electric-Department-Statement:-No-Indication-that-Electric-Grid-or-Customer-Information-Compromised", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-penetrated-us-electricity-grid-through-a-utility-in-vermont/2016/12/30/8fc90cc4-ceec-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html?utm_term=.e354b6a6396e", "https://twitter.com/jeffreycarr/status/815044495796375552"], "published": "2017-01-01T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T00:24:01.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
