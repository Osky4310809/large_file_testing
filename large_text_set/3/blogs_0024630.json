WordPress allows you to easily upload PDF files and make them available for download. In this article, we will show you how to easily upload PDF files to your WordPress site. \n\nUpload PDF Files in WordPress Posts and Pages This method is simpler and works without installing any plugin on your WordPress site. \nFirst you need to edit the post or page where you want to upload the PDF file. On the post editor screen, you need to click on the ‘Add Media’ button. \n\nThis will bring up the WordPress media uploader popup. \nNext, you need to click on ‘Select Files’ button to select the PDF file you want to upload. \n\nWordPress will now upload the PDF file to your website. \nOnce uploaded, you’ll see a thumbnail preview of your PDF file. On your right hand column, you can provide the title, caption, and description for your file. \nYou can also select how you want it to be linked. By default, it will link to the PDF file itself. You can change that to the attachment page , which will be a page showing just the pdf thumbnail preview of the first page of your PDF file. \n\nClick on the ‘Insert into post’ button to add the PDF file into your post. \nThe media uploader popup will now disappear, and you will see PDF file download link in your post editor. You can continue editing your post or publish it. \nThat’s all, you have successfully uploaded a PDF file and added it to a WordPress blog post. \nYou can now visit your website to see it in action.\n\nUpload and Embed a PDF file in WordPress Post or Page This method allows you to display the PDF file inside your WordPress post or page using a WordPress plugin. \nFirst thing you need to do is install and activate the Google Doc Embedder plugin. For more details, see our step by step guide on how to install a WordPress plugin .\nUpon activation, you need to visit Settings » GDE Settings page to configure plugin settings. \n\nHere you can specify the language, height and width of the embedder, and few other settings. Default options will work for most websites, but you can review and change them if you need. \nNext, you need to head over to the post or page where you want to embed PDF file. \nOn the post edit screen, you need to click on the ‘Add Media’ button to upload your PDF document. After uploading your file, you need to copy the file URL and close media uploader window without inserting the file into your post. \n\nNow, you need to click on the Google Docs Embedder icon in your WordPress post editor. \n\nThis will bring up a popup where you need to paste the PDF file URL you copied earlier and then click on the ‘Insert’ button. \n\nYou will see a shortcode added to your WordPress post editor. \nYou can now continue editing your post or publish it. \nVisit your website to see the PDF file embedded into your WordPress post. \n\nGoogle Doc Embeder plugin can also embed other documents in your WordPress posts and pages.
