When we were kids, we might sometimes find our parents annoying as they often told us to clean our rooms while we were busy at something. Or maybe you would get angry when you found yourself being treated unfairly. Think of the last time you got annoyed by something or someone, how did you deal with that? Here we have some advice for you.\nThe Rule of 24 Hours When you feel angry, remember to give yourself 24 hours before you react. As the saying goes, ‘Think twice before you act.’ 24 hours allow sufficient time for you to think twice, or even more. It is easy to say something you will regret later when you are overwhelmed by anger. These words may not be appropriate or they may even hurt others. In the heat of the moment, it is better for you to stay calm and keep those words in mind, at least for 24 hours. During that 24 hours, you can take a timeout for yourself. Give yourself a short break to make yourself feel better and to stay out of what makes you feel annoyed. Watch a movie, go for a walk, read some books, play sports, or even take a nap. It depends. Just simply do anything that makes you feel relaxed.\nAfter taking a break, if you still find the problem bothers you, voice your opinion or react maturely. Think of how you express yourself without harming others. It may not be about who is right or wrong, but it is about how you feel. You need not put others in an embarrassing situation. What you only need to do is to show others what you have in mind honestly in a positive way.\nEverything takes time. But if you keep practicing in such direction to manage your anger, you will be surprised at how many relationships you will save.\nFeatured photo credit: Grumpy Cat via twitter.com \nThe post This is Why You Should Give Yourself “24 Hours” When You Are Angry appeared first on Lifehack .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:01:41.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
