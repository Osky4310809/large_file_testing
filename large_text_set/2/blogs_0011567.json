Jamie shared a new picture (above) of her happy, look-alike daughter to Instagram and Twitter on Valentine's Day, sharing the caption: \n\"Maddie isn't quite ready to return to school, but her doctors did clear her to bring in her Valentine's Day treats to her class today. Thanks to @avery and @hersheycompany for making these treats for her to pass out, since I didn't have the time to make any myself this year. It made her so happy to see her friends, and be able to give them such cute treats. It was a great moment for us after everything that has happened. We are so thankful to celebrate Valentine's Day with the ones we love, and we don't take a second of it for granted ❤️Happy Valentine's Day❤️\" \nAww! Even if she's not ready to get back to school, at least Maddie got to celebrate the holiday with her friends and eat some chocolate. \nWe hope she takes it easy while she recovers — and Jamie too!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:47:51.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
