It has been a very nice week and a very special week because everything is new and I have to adapt to everything. It's been good and I'm enjoying it here.\" \nSince becoming Real Madrid and Norway's youngest ever senior player, Odegaard has received plenty of attention from fans and media. \nHowever, the attacking midfielder would prefer to avoid any hype surrounding him, and instead wants to concentrate on putting in good performances for his new club. \n\"I try not to focus so much about what others think about me. Just do my thing and play football,\" Odegaard continued. \n\"I'm a player who like to do things with the ball. I like to create chances for the team. \n\"When you are on the bench, you always hoping to get on the pitch. Especially the first time like this. \n\"I've only been here a few days so it was normal that I played few minutes.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T03:25:33.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
