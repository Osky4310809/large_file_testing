Before then, let’s take a look at the Galaxy S8’s specs, which TechnoBuffalo has exclusively obtained from a trusted source.\nIf you were excited by yesterday’s Galaxy S8 Plus leak , you’ll be happy to learn the Galaxy S8 will come equipped with virtually identical specs, right on down to the camera, RAM, and storage. The only major difference—so far as we can tell—will come down to which display size you prefer.\nThe Galaxy S8 will include: 5.8-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED display, 4GB of RAM, IP68 dust and water resistance, 12-megapixel dual-pixel camera, 8-megapixel front-facing camera, an iris scanner, 64GB of expandable memory, Samsung Pay, support for wireless charging, and included earphones tuned by AKG.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com Compared to the Galaxy S8 Plus’s spec sheet that leaked yesterday, it appears the two devices are a near match. That’s great news for consumers who prefer the Galaxy S8’s smaller form factor but still want a powerful device.\nWhile the spec sheet we received doesn’t reveal processor or battery size, it’s previously been rumored the S8 will sport a Snapdragon 835 chip, along with a battery size upwards of 3,000mAh.\nIn addition, we’re also expecting both handsets to feature edge-to-edge screens, which means the fingerprint sensor will be moved to the back—something we got a brief glimpse of in leaked photos earlier this week .\n\nLet’s compare the two devices Similar to the iPhone, it appears Samsung wants to keep parity between the two devices. But, whereas Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus has a more advanced camera compared to the iPhone 7, the information we received suggests the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will have identical 12-megapixel dual pixel cameras. That means consumers aren’t going to miss out on features just because they want a smaller device.\nWhichever device you choose, you’re getting what looks to be the most Android devices we’ve ever seen. As we said in yesterday’s leak, however, we still have a lot of questions that haven’t been addressed. Such as: Where’s Bixby? And how will Samsung’s DeX feature work ?\nAccording to the most recent report, Samsung is expected to unveil its Galaxy S8 series on March 29 , followed by a worldwide release on April 21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:26:15.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
