I think I speak for our McDonald’s family when I say how proud we are of Pedro.\n‘He is an excellent employee, so it didn’t surprise me that he took immediate action and jumped through a window to help save this woman. And he was not the only member of the team that played a pivotal role in ensuring she received the medical attention she needed.\n‘A second employee, who asked to remain unnamed, assisted with CPR.
