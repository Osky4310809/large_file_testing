To dine away from paying eyes. These days though they head to the number one showbiz location, the Chiltern Firehouse. The former fire station in Marylebone is so popular that A-listers just can’t get enough of it, even though it has been opened for the past three years. Chiltern Firehouse \nThe restaurant is the offering from hotel magnate André Balazs, who owns the glamorous Chateau Marmont in Hollywood and the Mercer hotel in the Big Apple. Originally one of London’s first purpose-built fire stations, the Grade II listed gothic Victorian building has been transformed by Balazs into a swanky New York-style brasserie with high ceilings, hanging light fittings, large mirrors and a busy open kitchen. \nGuests are greeted by attractive top-hatted doormen and escorted through a pretty garden courtyard to their tables. \nWho’s The Chef? \nThe kitchen is headed up by chef Nuno Mendes who has created a relaxed but vibrant menu with many American flourishes. Typical dishes include chargrilled iberico pork and blackened salmon with sea kale. But the Chiltern’s most famous signature dish is their crab-stuffed donuts. Delicious and bitesize, what more could you want!

Most of the mains are around the £25 mark, while wood grilled ribeye would push you to £36. Three courses about £45, without wine. \nHow Do I Get A Table? \nYour best bet is to start dating a celebrity – the restaurant operates a rigorous screening policy that prioritises famous faces over civilians. If you’re not feeling lucky in love, try booking for a less popular time: a Monday lunch perhaps, or an early dinner. Kitchen W8 - Kensington \nOne of London’s best kept secrets, Kitchen W8 maybe the most popular haunt amongst celebs in town but has kept under the radar. Until now! The stylish venue is nestled unassumingly in one of Kensington’s side streets but has steadily built up a reputation as being the number one choice for the rich and famous in the know.

His knowledge and love of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese food and culinary heritage grew at the venue, and can still be seen in his choice of oriental dishes on The Ivy’s menu. After a major refurb 2 years ago, Lee brought on a new menu with great seasonal choices, a larger pan-Asian section, more salads and vegetables and a new “sea & shells” section. \nWhat Will A Meal Cost? \nAn average meal will cost roughly £41 or over. The trademark Shepherds Pie alone will set you back £19.50 as a main.

His favourite seasonal ingredients are autumnal treats where vegetables have a much stronger flavour and meat is also more generally matured and flavoursome. A great dish according to James, is a combination of great ingredients and a little bit of technique, a dual approach that he brings to all his own cooking. Lindsay Lohan is amongst those who have dined at Quaglinos \nWhat Will A Meal Cost? \nThree courses at dinner with a glass of champagne will set you back just £33 a head! \nWho Might I Spot? \nAngelina Jolie, William Hague, Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan and Bryan Ferry have all enjoyed nights there. \nHow Do I Get A Table? \nThe easy of the five to get a table but still quite a challenge on a Friday or Saturday night.
