You can see a clear look at the home screen, and what looks like just about every settings menu (in Spanish), but the real gem is the shot of the camera interface. \nClick through to the seventh image in AndroidMX‚Äôs slideshow and you‚Äôll the camera, complete with a barely discernible üêª in the right corner. No one seems to know what this is for. \nSome commenters have speculated it‚Äôs so you can add stickers to your photos (it‚Äôs also next to what appears to be a sketching tool). Some think the Bear is actually the symbol for Bixby (which seems unlikely), so it may be used to enable to the camera‚Äôs rumored iris-scanning abilities. Maybe, but there‚Äôs also an eye icon on the left side of the camera, which is most likely for the Bixby-powered visual search we‚Äôve been hearing about and having two Bixby buttons on the camera seems like a little much. \nBut then again, Samsung is trying to make its new assistant the star of the S8, so nothing‚Äôs really off the table. \nWhat we do know is we don‚Äôt have to wait much longer to find out. Samsung will finally, finally, put us out of our misery Wednesday, March, 29th, when it makes its big S8 reveal in New York.
