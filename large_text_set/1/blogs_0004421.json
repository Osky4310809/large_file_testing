Announced by Kendall Jenner via social media, the festival will be headlined by G.O.O.D. Music -- but the other artists have yet to be specified. Ticket packages can be purchased online, but they don't come at a cheap price. Solo travelers will pay $1,595 USD; pairs will spend $3,195 USD; yacht-owners will be paying $3,394 USD per person. If you're looking for the ultimate VIP experience, groups can rent out an \"artist's palace\" for $50,000 USD per person.\nSo hyped to announce my G.O.O.D. Music Family as the first headliners for @fyrefestival. Get tix now at fyrefestival.com.
