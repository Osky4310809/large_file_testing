The allegations were investigated by a state task force that examined a recruiting scandal at the school. Joseph was not charged or interviewed as part of the investigation. \nOn Saturday, The Boulder Daily Camera published details it obtained from a 2004 Boulder Police Department report . \nOne of the two women involved said she did not want to press charges and the other declined to talk to police. As a result, the case was closed. \nJoseph had never publicly addressed the allegations before Wednesday, when, in an interview with The Denver Post about the team and his recent coaching hires, he said the claims of sexual assault “are false.” \n“That was resolved a long time ago,” he said. “For myself, for my family, for the Denver Broncos , I’m disappointed and embarrassed. I was a young guy and it showed to my immaturity and irresponsibility in my life when I was younger. But I’ve grown so much and that’s why I’m disappointed, because I’ve grown so much as a person, as a coach, as a father, as a husband. \n“Everyone who knows me knows that I try to live my life the right way, and I regret that my name is even associated with this.” \nJoseph spoke with Broncos general manager John Elway and president/CEO Joe Ellis about the allegations in the past week.
