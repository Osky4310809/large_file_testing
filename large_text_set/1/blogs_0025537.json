It will also say that his wife, Penelope Fillon, allegedly earned more than 900,000 euros as a parliamentary assistant for more than a decade and as a contributor to a magazine. That’s higher than the 600,000 euros that the Canard previously reported. \nThe initial revelations about Penelope’s work for her husband last week prompted prosecutors to open a probe into the family’s income, throwing Fillon’s bid for the presidency off course. la une du Canard enchaÃ®nÃ© de demain pic.twitter.com/BKfOTnjFPE — Vivien Vergnaud (@Vergnaud) January 31, 2017 Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Fillon has been the establishment’s leading candidate in the battle to stop Marine Le Pen’s populist campaign to seize the presidency and lead France out of the euro. Fillon won the Republicans’ primary boasting that he had the irreproachable integrity required to lead the country. While polls show Le Pen leading in the first round of voting, they also suggest that she would lose heavily to any of the main candidates in a run-off. For an explainer on the Fillon scandal, click here \nWith less than three months to go before the first round of voting in France’s 2017 election, Fillon has promised to withdraw from the race if the preliminary inquiry becomes a formal one -- something that has never happened to a major French candidate this late in a presidential contest. Police Interrogation \nA Kantar Sofres poll released Monday in Le Figaro suggests that the scandal has cost Fillon support. About 22 percent of voters now back the Republican for the first round of voting, leaving him just one point ahead of independent Emmanuel Macron and three points behind the Le Pen. Before the inquiry, Fillon was considered the favorite to be France’s next president. \nVoting is scheduled for April 23 and the two leading candidates from that battle face each other in a run off on May 7. \nInvestigators on Tuesday searched for documents at the National Assembly, a day after Fillon and his wife were separately questioned for about five hours by the police as part of the probe. The presidential candidate was “happy to defend his honor,” Antonin Levy, Fillon’s lawyer, said on BFM television. A parliamentary job’s assistant is often “less tangible” than other types of work, Levy added. \nInvestigators have searched the offices of Revue des Deux Mondes, the magazine that Penelope Fillon contributed to, and interviewed the magazine’s former director and its owner, billionaire Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere.
