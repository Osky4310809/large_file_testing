He pleaded guilty to 64 felony counts. \nHospital employee Andre Baker was charged in October with felony patient abuse and assault for grabbing a patient by his neck “in a sudden and quick fashion” and injuring him after an argument. \nThe VA would not confirm that Baker’s employment had been terminated. \nFollow Luke  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:28:45.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
