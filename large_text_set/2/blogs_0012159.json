If the Japanese brand does manage to achieve this target (an 8% increase over 2016), it would be the first time its sales hit six figures. \nThis follows from a sterling 2016 for the company, in which Honda became Malaysia’s second most popular automotive brand, buoyed by the launch of the new Civic and facelifted Accord. This is despite a challenging year for the industry as a whole , with the TIV dipping below the 600,000-unit mark for the first time in six years, at 580,124 units. \nAs a result of the industry’s slump, Honda Malaysia’s sales fell 3.2% from 94,902 units to 91,830 units. Even so, this meant a market share of 15.8%, the second highest in Honda’s global automotive operations. \nTo help it on its way to the 100,000-unit mark this year, Honda Malaysia will introduce at least four new models. One of these, the BR-V seven-seat SUV , has already been launched, while the facelifted City will go on sale soon, with order books already opened. \nGroup head vice president Akkbar Danial also teased that an incoming full model change for one of its SUV models, which can only be the new fifth-generation CR-V . The company has also confirmed that it will be launching a hybrid model, using its Intelligent Dual-Clutch Drive (Sport Hybrid i-DCD) powertrain – it already teased the Jazz Hybrid at an event last year.
