Col. Angaris “Gary” Pawa on Wednesday said it was his sister Jakatia Pawa herself who confirmed the looming execution through a phone call from her detention cell. \nBut another DZMM report, citing jail and Philippine embassy officials, said the execution was scheduled at 12:30 p.m. Manila time. ADVERTISEMENT \nPawa, a household helper from Zamboanga, was accused of stabbing her employer’s 22-year-old daughter while asleep in May 2007 and sentenced to death by Kuwait’s Court of First Instance. The verdict was upheld by the Court of Cassation in 2013. \nPresidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay and department officials are meeting at the moment “to discuss the situation and if there are available remedies to the government at this stage.” \nIn a text message, Department of Foreign Affairs assistant secretary Charles Jose said a press briefing on Pawa’s case will be held at 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday.
