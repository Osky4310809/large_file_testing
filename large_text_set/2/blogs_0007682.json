Maybe that’s about to change: A team of Spanish researchers discovered they could age brandy at warp speed by shooting ultrasonic waves through it. Brandy, by the U.S. interpretation, must be aged for at least two years to be sold as such, otherwise it must be labeled as “immature.” But thanks to the miracle of science, the Spanish brandy aged quite quickly. How quickly? Three days quickly. Two years of aging in three days. Either this is Benjamin Button’s personal barrel, or there’s some serious trickery afoot. \nHere’s how they did it, according to the study published in Ultrasonics Sonochemistry : Brandy gets distilled when the oak barrel that contains it breaks down over time, but oak is used specifically because it decomposes at a glacial rate. So the researchers put oak chips in a glass tube with wine (the liquid from which brandy is distilled) and shot ultrasonic waves through it. The waves opened up little holes in the oak, and as the oak broke down it released its oaky chemicals into the wine to make brandy.
