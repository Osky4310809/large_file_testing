It continued a string of strong Colorado pitching performances early in spring training. \nColorado’s offense was powered by a three-run homer by catcher Tony Wolters and a solo shot by first base prospect Jordan Patterson . \nFor Starters: Jon Gray looked sharp for his first game of the spring, allowing no runs on two hits and striking out two. He did plunk Dodgers star shortstop Corey Seager, putting two on with no out in the first. But Gray got Yasmani Grandal to ground to short, whiffed Franklin Gutierrez with high heat and then got Joc Pederson to top the ball to second for the final out. \n“I was just trying to get it up in the letters and I was able to do that,” Gray said of the fastball that finished off Gutierrez. \nOn the inside slider that induced the groundout by Pederson, Gray said: “I threw it exactly where I wanted. I was happy about that pitch.” \nAdded manager Bud Black: “I thought Jon’s delivery repeated itself. There was a nice presence today, even though it was a spring training game. There was a presence to Jon Gray that I liked. \nHe looked focused and in a good frame of mind.” \nRight-hander Jeff Hoffman , competing for the final spot in the rotation, had good stuff, even if his line didn’t show it. In 1 ⅓ innings, he gave up a run on three hits. But two of the Dodgers’ hits in the fourth inning were bloopers, including a wounded duck to center by Yasiel Puig. \n“I threw him a fastball in on the hands, just like I wanted to, but it dropped in,” Hoffman said. “But that’s baseball.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:47:17.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
