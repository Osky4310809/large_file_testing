Angeli Kakade (@angelikakade) has the story. Buzz60 'La La Land' producer Jordan Horowitz shows the envelope revealing \"Moonlight\" as the true winner of best picture at the Oscars, as presenter Warren Beatty and host Jimmy Kimmel look on. (Photo: Chris Pizzello, Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)   \nNow the Academy is officially sorry for #EnvelopeGate and is vowing to take \"action\" against the responsible party — their accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers \nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences apologized for Sunday's Oscar-ending fiasco, which saw presenters   initially, and incorrectly, awarding the best picture award to La La Land — instead of the actual winner Moonlight. \n\"We deeply regret the mistakes that were made during the presentation of the Best Picture category during last night’s Oscar ceremony. We apologize to the entire cast and crew of La La Land and Moonlight whose experience was profoundly altered by this error,\" an Academy statement released late Monday read. \"We salute the tremendous grace they displayed under the circumstances.\" Here's how the worst flub in Oscar history went down \nThe statement continued: \"To all involved — including our presenters  , the filmmakers, and our fans watching worldwide — we apologize.\" \nThe Academy said it would take some action against longtime tabulating partner PricewaterhouseCoopers. The accounting firm said Monday it had made \"a human error\" when a representative gave Beatty the incorrect award envelope, prompting the mistaken announcement. \nLa La Land filmmakers had already begun thank-you speeches on the stage before the error was dramatically announced and the best picture award was handed to the rightful winner, Moonlight.
