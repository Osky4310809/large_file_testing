Higuain stabbed home from close range after Sami Khedira's cross struck Stefano Sturaro and dropped kindly for the Argentinian. \nFiorentina generally did a good job of keeping Juve at arm's length thereafter, but had two lucky escapes in the final 10 minutes. \nCiprian Tatarusanu closed his legs just in time to keep a Higuain header out and, in the ensuing scramble, Giorgio Chiellini saw his effort kept out by the goalkeeper. \nPaulo Dybala then blazed over after darting into the box with two minutes to go, letting Fiorentina off the hook.
