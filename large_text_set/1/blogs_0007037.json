P480.7 million of the Saro’s value was immediately released. ADVERTISEMENT \nBut a few days later on June 19, the DBM informed Degamo that the SARO was being withdrawn over the province’s failure to comply with existing guidelines for infrastructure projects. Instead of returning the funds, Degamo proceeded with the award of 11 infrastructure contracts worth P143.2 million.
