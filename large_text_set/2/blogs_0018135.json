In addition to covering a study that declared golf \"totally counts as work,\" Fallon's Trump says he was absolutely right about there being recent attacks by refugees in Sweden last Friday, a statement that Swedish officials have refuted .\n\"Sweden is still reeling from Friday's incident that absolutely did happen,\" Fallon's Trump said. \"Details are still unclear, but we're getting word it was definitely and 100% not made up.\"\nHe also patted himself on the back for finding a candidate to replace his former national security adviser, who resigned amid allegations of collusion with Russian officials . After his first pick for a replacement passed on the offer, Trump named H.R. McMaster to the post over the weekend.\n\"Normally when I'm talking to H.R., it's because one of my female employees is threatening to sue,\" he said. \"But now, H.R. is going to stand for 'huge ratings.'\"\nThere was also a rather awkward weather report from s ecretary of education Betsy DeVos (played by \"Tonight Show\" writer Jo Firestone).\nFinally, Fallon capped off the Trump news report by predicting the next big news story using the \"100% accurate bad things button.\" This time around, it chose a Godzilla attack in Finland.\n\"Can you believe it? And Godzilla of all people,\" Fallon's Trump said. \"We really need to capture Godzilla and send him back to China.\"\nWatch the sketch below:\nSEE ALSO: Jimmy Fallon brings back his Trump impression for that wild press conference DON'T MISS: Seth Meyers blasts Trump's Sweden snafu: He's 'making up his own fake stories' NOW WATCH: People on Twitter are mocking Trump's claim that his administration is a â€˜fined-tuned machine' Loading video...
