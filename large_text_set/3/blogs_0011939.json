Sure, it was a gag gun, but even then the rapper couldn’t hide his anger. Not to mention he had the actor playing Trump dressed in clown makeup and orange face paint, of course. Like he told Pitchfork , Snoop described his video as a way to deal “with the real issue with this f***ing clown as president, and the sh*t that we dealing with out here.” \nSnoop elaborated on his pent-up rage: \n“The ban that this motherf**ker tried to put up; him winning the presidency; police being able to kill motherf**kers and get away with it; people being in jail for weed for 20, 30 years and motherf**kers that’s not black on the streets making money off of it — but if you got color or ethnicity connected to your name, you’ve been wrongfully accused or locked up for it, and then you watching people not of color position themselves to get millions and billions off of it. It’s a lot of clown sh*t going on that we could just sit and talk on the phone all day about, but it’s a few issues that we really wanted to lock into [for the video] like police, the president and just life in general.” \nAccording to The Blaze , though Marco Rubio thinks the rapper should’ve thought this out more carefully. \nTMZ later caught up to Rubio on Monday and asked him about the video. The senator made note that presidents have been assassinated before, and Snoop’s video may encourage the wrong person. \n“I think people can disagree on policy,” said Rubio. “But we’ve got to be very careful about that kind of thing, because the wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, and you can have a real problem.” \n“I’m not sure what Snoop was thinking,” added Rubio. “He should think about that a little bit. You know?” \nWhere’s all the outrage, Hollywood? Crickets. Chirping. \nHowever, TMZ did ask Senator Rubio about the video.
