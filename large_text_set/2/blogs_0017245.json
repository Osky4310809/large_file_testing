According to a press release, the first special is titled simply 2017 , and it will be available on April 4. The second special doesn’t have a premiere date, but it’s probably at least a year off. \nIn a statement, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said that CK is “one of the most innovative comedy voices in this new era of stand-up,” adding that he’s “a thought leader in the business of comedy.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:30:12.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
