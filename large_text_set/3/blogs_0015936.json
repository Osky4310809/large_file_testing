Trump did not back down from the wiretapping claim as recently as Friday. \n\"On wiretapping by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps,\" Trump said to German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a joint press conference. The National Security Agency allegedly monitored phone calls involving Merkel and her aides, straining relations with Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama . \nThe White House and its allies in recent days have attempted to change the interpretation of Trump's explosive tweets from earlier this month. In four separate statements on Twitter, Trump said he was the target of a wiretap. \nIn two of those, Trump put quotes around the term, which White House Spokesperson Sean Spicer said means he may not have meant it literally. Still, in one of those tweets, Trump called it a \"fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:17:10.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
