I seriously doubt that Trump has ever read a book straight through in his adult life.” \nHe also mentions that during this time, he never once saw a book on President Trump’s desk or anywhere in his office or apartment. \nWhile running his presidential campaign, Trump had stated that he would make a good president because he wrote The Art of the Deal, but it’s obvious (and factual) that the book was ghostwritten for him. \nAccording to a report from Axios.com, even some of Trump’s advisors have said anonymously that they’ve never seen him read a book, or even talk about a book he’s read. \nHis advisors also said that the president doesn’t surf the web or even use a computer; he just scrolls through Twitter on his phone. Words don’t seem to come naturally to him, seeing as Trump himself has said that other people usually write his tweets. \nThere’s also several articles that circulated during the presidential campaign about Trump’s poor public speaking skills; one from the Washington Post in particular focused on a study done by Carnegie Mellon University titled, “A Readability Analysis of Campaign Speeches From the 2016 US Presidential Campaign,” scored Trump at “just below 6th grade level.” \nThe results, as well as Schwartz’s comments, are not much of a surprise when President Trump can seemingly only end his angrily constructed tweets with “Sad!” or doesn’t bother to check the spelling of “unprecedented.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:11:02.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
