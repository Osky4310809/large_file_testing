As you can see above, the titles are not for the faint of heart. The five colors are named Hopeless Romantic, Hot and Bothered, Barely Legal, X Rated, and Virginity (a relaunch from Kylie's Valentine's Day collection ). \nTwitter users immediately voiced their concerns. Some were just sickened by the names. \"Can kylie jenner not sexualize young women w her blush names like 'virginity' and 'barely legal,'\" Twitter user @purgatories asked. Most saw parallels to the makeup maven's own life in the shades, particularly her relationship with Tyga. \"Kylie named a blush after her and Tygas relationship, awww,\" tweeted @clairebwalsh . But some just pointed out that controversial beauty product names have been done before. \"Sweetie, leave the cheeky names to Nars and do less,\" said @TheRealKatPat . \nRead on to see the colors — and the comments about them on social media — and come up with your own conclusions before the shades drop on Friday, March 24.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:48:46.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
