As we write this, the intellect of the show is fast approaching rock-bottom. Expectedly, when Varun and Alia (ardent disciples of the host) appeared on the show, there were more inside jokes, than warranted, with multiple sexual innuendos thrown in for good measure. Thankfully for us, two solid relationship revelations were made – Varun did blow the whistle on Alia and Siddharth, it was confirmed that Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani are, officially, a thing. Aside from these mini-scoops and Varun’s one-minute-Oscar-speech about his emotional situationship with Alia, class monitor Karan Johar kept things decidedly salacious. \nHere’s looking at all those cringe-worthy moments. \n1.On being complemented on his “biker look” by Karan Johar, Varun swiftly returned the favour by saying… wait for it…“Love your zips!” Okay, then. \n2.When Varun brought out a hair dryer out of nowhere to cheer Alia Bhatt up and Karan posed an innocent question, “Why are you blowing her?” Sadly, the joke didn’t end at that. The sexual banter then progressed into him investigating Varun (because, why not?), with the question, “You also want to be blown?” And like a self-admitted narcissist, he answered, “Sometimes!” \nEeeeks. \n3.And then, a wild phallic object (apparently, a hairdryer) was handed over to Alia by Varun, which in the words of Karan “looked suspect”. It was given under the pretext of “turning her on”. Matters worsened when Alia found the object to be only vibrating. It was eventually put away since Karan didn’t find it aligning with the aesthetic of the show. *Inward vomit* \n4.When Varun, thankfully, chose to comment on the one-dimensional sexual narrative of the show, Karan’s comeback was to point in the direction of his hand (that was placed casually near his crotch). Real mature, Karan, real mature! Varun revived himself from this immature blow by placing a pillow on his crotch, which, too was tuned into a sexual quip… for fifth graders, of course. And now, onto to the excruciatingly slow coming-out ceremony of Karan Johar’s that has been decades in the making. \n5.ICYMI, Karan has fantasized about the actors that he’s worked with, had phone sex, and lied through his nose while praising an actor. \n6.Probably playing his younger teen self, Karan read out a recipe as a curious boy on the cusp of adolescence. Assuming that the chat show can barely survive without overtly sexual antics, this one did strike as mildly amusing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:48:04.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
