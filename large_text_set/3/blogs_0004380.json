In the wake of 90s actresses’ befriending social media, fans have been allowed a generous peak into their life… and wardrobes. Latest to join this party is the always-sexy Raveena Tandon. Back in the day, the actress brought out her best moves in a now-iconic yellow sari for the song, Tip Tip Barsa Pani (her sensual gyrations have been imitated by all of us), and wore quintessential pre-millennium skirts, starring alongside Govinda. Her style has always been a talking point and, with these recent gems from Instagram, we are feeling mighty inspired (hey, it’s got nothing on that yellow sari, though) 1.Raveena’s big-fat-Indian-wedding style featured a gold Manish Malhotra gown, toned clavicles, sleek hair, and blush lips. \nsurina92/via Instagram 2.For a book launch, the actress picked a Label Ritu Kumar dress, that was a quite a change of pace from her signature-glamorous style. The promising sleek hair was stuck to. \npoojagulabani/via Instagram 3.Doing ethnic, Raveena ji emerged in a printed dress by Label Anushree, complementing Amrapali jewellery and strong berry lips. \nofficialraveenatandon/via Instagram \n4.In what could secure her a definitive place in the best-dressed list, our forever-woman-crush stepped out in a pared-down, grey sari by Anavila. BRB, need to replicate that Frida Kahlo-inspired low bun flanked by a giant rose. \nafashionistadiaries/via Instagram \n5.Also, girlfriend can slay at high-street style too. We’ll just leave this hella chic floral dress that she recently wore for a night-out. That keyhole-neck though!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T12:49:11.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
