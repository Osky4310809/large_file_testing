INQUIRER FILE PHOTO \n  chief presidential legal counsel described as “foreign intrusion” the call of the European Parliament on the Philippine government to release Sen. Leila de Lima from detention. \n“Iyon ang maliwanag na foreign intrusion. Kagaya ng sinabi mo, wala silang pakialam dito sa ginagawa natin sa ating bansa (This is a clear foreign intrusion. As you said, they should not interfere with what we do in our country),” lawyer Salvador Panelo said in a radio interview on Friday. \nThe EU Parliament’s joint motion said there were “serious concerns for (De Lima’s) safety,” adding that journalists, human rights defenders and activists like her “face regular threats, harassment, intimidation and cyber bullying.” ADVERTISEMENT \nIt described the embattled senator as “a human rights advocate and the highest profile critic of Philippine   anti-drug campaign.” \nOn Thursday, Malacañang said the EU Parliament has a “misunderstanding of what’s happening to [de Lima].” \n“The lady is being charged with crime—not political persuasions,” he said. “So I think they ought to respect that,” presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said.
