Twitter Courtesy of Instagram/ @iammariaborges \nA Maria Borges L’Oréal Paris contract was just announced, and there's about a bajillion reasons we're so excited to bring you that news. Angolan model Maria Borges is a Fashion Week regular, having walked in 17 shows during her first month alone under contract with Supreme in 2012, and a slew since then. In 2013, she began modeling for Victoria’s Secret, which pushed her closer to supermodel status. Then, in 2015, she made history as the first model to walk in the VS show with an afro. She’d cut her hair short for designer Riccardo Tisci (formerly at the helm of Givenchy), who has worked with Maria often and counts her a muse — and she decided to go out on a limb and ask Victoria’s Secret if she could walk in the show without extensions. To her surprise, they said yes. In 2016, several models rocked cropped, natural-texture hair on the Victoria’s Secret runway. In short, she has proven in just a few years as a model, and at only 24-years-old, that she’s more than a face — she’s a force. \nYesterday, she achieved another milestone in her career when she became the newest spokesmodel for L’Oréal Paris. Maria has worked with the French cosmetics house a few times in the past, but this new partnership puts her the company of names like Blake Lively, Jennifer Lopez, and Liya Kebede. As part of the partnership, she handpicked up-and-coming Nigerian model Olamide Ogundele to join her at Paris fashion week. Maria will also star in international ad campaigns and represent L’Oréal Paris at press events, among other things. \nL’Oréal Paris, for their part, has been focusing more on inclusivity in their castings and messaging. The UK branch of the company recently launched a campaign featuring hijab-wearing beauty blogger Amen; Katie Piper, a sulphuric acid attack survivor; and curve model Jada Sezer, among others. The campaign, called the “All Worth It” project, is aimed at building confidence in women and teens through confidence training and other initiatives. The Maria Borges L’Oréal Paris contract is yet another sign that beauty and fashion are moving in the right direction. Congratulations, Maria on your monumental career achievement.
