I don’t ­understand how someone could do something like that. \n“It’s disgusting.” \nBethany added: “I think it’s disgraceful. There are some things that are funny, but that isn’t. This actually happened to my dad and it’s not something to joke about.” \nFormer hostage John ­McCarthy, 60, yesterday said the singer had turned “a grotesque thing into a kind of pantomime”.
