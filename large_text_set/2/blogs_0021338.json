Woman at the Well - Story Summary: \nTraveling from Jerusalem in the south to Galilee in the north, Jesus and his disciples took the quickest route, through Samaria . Tired and thirsty, Jesus sat by Jacob's Well, while his disciples went to the village of Sychar, about a half mile away, to buy food. It was about noon, the hottest part of the day, and a Samaritan woman came to the well at this inconvenient time, to draw water. \nIn his encounter with the woman at the well, Jesus broke three Jewish customs: first, he spoke to a woman; second, she was a Samaritan woman, a group the Jews traditionally despised; and third, he asked her to get him a drink of water, which would have made him ceremonially unclean from using her cup or jar. This shocked the woman at the well. \nThen Jesus told the woman he could give her \" living water \" so that she would never thirst again. Jesus used the words living water to refer to eternal life, the gift that would satisfy her soul's desire only available through him. At first, the Samaritan woman did not fully understand Jesus' meaning. \nAlthough they had never met before, Jesus revealed that he knew she had had five husbands and was now living with a man who was not her husband. Jesus now had her attention! \nAs they talked about their two views on worship, the woman voiced her faith that Messiah was coming. Jesus answered, \"I who speak to you am he.\" (John 4:26, ESV ) \nAs the woman began to grasp the reality of her encounter with Jesus, the disciples returned. They were equally shocked to find him speaking to a woman. Leaving behind her water jar, the woman returned to town, inviting the people to \"Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did.\" (John 4:29, ESV ) \nMeanwhile, Jesus told his disciples the harvest of souls was ready, sown by the prophets, writers of the Old Testament , and John the Baptist . \nExcited by what the woman told them, the Samaritans came from Sychar and begged Jesus to stay with them. \nSo Jesus stayed two days, teaching the Samaritan people about the Kingdom of God. When he left, the people told the woman, \"... we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.\" (John 4:42, ESV ) Points of Interest from the Story of the Woman at the Well: \n• The Samaritans were a mixed race people, who had intermarried with the Assyrians centuries before. They were hated by the Jews because of this cultural mixing, and because they had their own version of the Bible and their own temple on Mount Gerizim. \n• The woman at the well came to draw water at the hottest part of the day, instead of the usual morning or evening times, because she was shunned and rejected by the other women of the area for her immorality . Jesus knew her history but still accepted her and ministered to her. \n• By reaching out to the Samaritans, Jesus showed that his mission was to the entire earth, not just the Jews. In the book of Acts , after Jesus' ascension into heaven, his apostles carried on his work in Samaria and to the Gentile world. \n• Ironically, while the High Priest and Sanhedrin rejected Jesus as the Messiah, the outcast Samaritans recognized him and accepted him for who he truly was: the Savior of the world. Question for Reflection: \nOur human tendency is to judge others because of stereotypes, customs or prejudices. Jesus treats people as individuals, accepting them with love and compassion. Do you dismiss certain people as lost causes, or do you see them as valuable in their own right, worthy of knowing about the gospel ?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:59:31.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
