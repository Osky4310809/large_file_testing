The uppers are a blend of black and grey fabric.\nThere’s little else to say about the shot, as all it was accompanied by was a couple of handfuls of hashtags, but an observant commenter posting from the handle @1dopebloke seems to suggest that the upper is crafted from marled wool, writing: “Fire. I just got the Triple Black Uncaged and damn, id [ sic ] still scoop these. Marled wool. Wow!”\nKeep it locked on @sneakerprophet_’s Instagram as there will no doubt be more images soon.\nCheck out this adidas Ultra Boost Uncaged with multicolor speckles .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T14:28:58.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
