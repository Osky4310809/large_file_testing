From Politico: \n“The sides stressed the importance of rebuilding mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between the two countries’ business communities, which could give an additional impetus to progressive and sustainable development of bilateral relations,” the Kremlin’s office said in a statement. \n“During the conversation, both sides expressed their readiness to make active joint efforts to stabilize and develop Russia-US cooperation on a constructive, equitable and mutually beneficial basis.” \nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer, National Security Advisor Gen. Michael Flynn and senior advisor Steve Bannon were all present during the call. Trump also had conversations with leaders of Japan, Germany, France and Australia over the weekend.
