Mahmood Yakubu \nYakubu, however, added that the commission had resolved to meet with the heads of the nation’s judiciary to put an end to cases of conflicting court orders. \n“The issue of conflicting orders is one that we shall take up with the judiciary,” he said, adding that only one of the 167 elections had been nullified by the courts. \nYakubu also revealed that 38 of the nation’s political parties continued to flout the rules on campaign financing, saying only two have submitted their statements of account to INEC. \n“They are to file such statements within six months after the general elections and only two parties have complied with this provision, because the two parties said they received nothing and so there was nothing to declare. They said that they did not even participate in the elections,”, Yakubu explained. \nThe INEC boss, however, solicited the support of the media ahead of the next general elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:47:58.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
