Westbrook had 28 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists, falling just short. \nWith just 13 games left in the regular season, Westbrook is averaging 31.7 points, 10.5 rebounds and 10.4 assists, and he needs eight more triple-doubles to break Oscar Robertson's record of 41 in a season. \nWestbrook will face 12 teams in the final month — six playoff-bound, and three of the top four defenses in the league — as the Thunder compete for playoff positioning and Westbrook vies for the MVP. \nWill Westbrook put the finishing touches on his historic season? Let's take a look at the 12 teams that can stop him. NBAE NBAE/Getty Images Golden State Warriors (March 20) \nFittingly, this stretch starts with the Warriors on national TV, though Kevin Durant isn't expected to be back from his knee injury. But Steph Curry should be in the lineup, and his prediction for MVP should provide plenty of motivation for Westbrook to torch him. \nWestbrook's averaging 31.3, 10.7 and 10.3 in three losses to Golden State, including 47 the last time out, so the Warriors' only chance at stopping him might be to put Draymond on him all game. Mark D. Smith Mark D. Smith-USA TODAY Sports Philadelphia 76ers (March 22) \nBeware the short-handed Sixers, coming off a victory at the Lakers, a near-upset at the Warriors and a 42-point dismantling of Dallas. Philly's playing for pride if nothing else, and proving to be a problem for teams down the stretch. \nBut Westbrook had 32, 12 and 9 in the teams' season-opening meeting, and with no Joel Embiid or Nerlens Noel to protect the rim, Russ should have even less trouble attacking. @ Houston Rockets (March 26) \nThe Thunder begin a three-game road trip with a nationally televised duel that could decide the MVP race: Westbrook vs. James Harden. If that doesn't motivate the Beard and his teammates to play some defense, nothing will. \nWestbrook is averaging 35, 8.3 and 8 in three games (two losses) against Houston, including 49 in a Jan. 5 loss. He's also hitting 38.5 percent of his threes — guess the Rockets' touch from deep is contagious. @ Dallas Mavericks (March 27) \nPlaying at Dallas on the second night of a back-to-back won't be easy, especially after a shootout in Houston. And Westbrook will have to step up his game against the Mavs, the No. 3 defense in the league. \nWestbrook averaged 37, 7 and 4 in splitting the first two matchups with the Mavs, scoring 45 in a Jan. 26 win and losing March 5 at Dallas after Noel arrived in a trade (and against a backcourt of Seth Curry and Yogi Ferrell). AP AP @ Orlando Magic (March 29) \nA trip to Orlando isn't as tough or meaningful now that Serge Ibaka has been traded to Toronto, but the Thunder will be trying to tune up for a big game when they get back home. \nWestbrook had 41, 12 and 16 in a loss to Orlando, and another performance like that could sew up his triple-double average for the season. But Elfrid Payton will be trying for a triple-double of his own. San Antonio Spurs (March 31) \nThe Thunder return home to a nationally televised game with the Spurs, and unless Coach Pop opts to sits his stars, this should be a battle. With Kawhi Leonard also in the MVP conversation and that No. 1 playoff spot up for grabs, expect the Spurs to turn up their second-ranked defense. \nWestbrook averaged 25, 9.5 and 13.5 in splitting two games against the Spurs, so he should be up for the challenge against Kawhi. Get your popcorn for that one. \nNBAE NBAE/Getty Images Charlotte Hornets (April 2) \nThe Hornets have faded so hard, there's no telling if they'll even show up, much less stop Westbrook from getting his numbers. \nThough Westbrook had 33, 15 and 8 in a Jan. 4 loss over Charlotte, so good luck Kemba Walker. Milwaukee Bucks (April 4) \nThe Bucks are coming on strong down the stretch, so the Thunder will have their hands full against the Greek Freak. \nWestbrook averaged 30, 7 and 6 in a Jan. 2 loss at Milwaukee, and the Bucks have a top-10 defense. @ Memphis Grizzlies (April 5) \nThe Grizz will be battling the Thunder for playoff position, so this should be a tough second game of back-to-backs. \nWestbrook is averging 27.7, 10.3 and 8 in three games (two wins) against Memphis, which boasts the fourth-ranked defense in the league. @ Phoenix Suns (April 7) \nWestbrook has torched the Suns for 51 and 48 points, so scoring won't be an issue. He'll just have to make sure he spreads the ball around enough and gets boards against Phoenix, a top-10 rebounding team. \nWestbrook is averaging 41.7, 13.7 and 13.7 in three games (two wins) vs. Phoenix, and since the Suns have shut down their vets, this could be a season-sealing performance by Russ. Mark D. Smith Mark D. Smith-USA TODAY Sports Denver Nuggets (April 9, 12) \nThe Nuggets are competing for the eighth and final playoff position in the West and should be pushing hard in this home-and-away pair. Also, the Nuggets and Thunder are the top rebounding teams in the NBA, so they'll be battling for every board. \nWestbrook is averaging 34, 14 and 14 in two wins over Denver, and the Nuggets (along with the Suns) are among the worst defensive teams in the league. Russ could go nuclear in this final stretch. Mark D. Smith Mark D. Smith-USA TODAY Sports @ Minnesota Timberwolves (April 11) \nThe Wolves have nothing but young guys to throw at Westbrook, and they're among the best under 25. Whether or not they'll get up for this one with Westbrook is another question. \nWestbrook is averging 26.7, 8 and 11.7 in three games (two wins) against the Wolves, but he had a quadruple-double with 10 turnovers in their last meeting. \nPrediction: Westbrook will finish with 42 triple-doubles to edge Robertson for the record, he'll become just the second player to average one for a season, and he'll win the MVP by a narrow margin over Harden.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T05:02:13.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
