We do have to examine new mechanisms like luxury taxes and in particular sporting criteria like squad limitations and fair transfer rules, to avoid player hoarding and excessive concentration of talent within a few teams,\" said the Slovenian lawyer, who was elected to the role last September. \nHe did not give any further details on what he meant by luxury taxes or fair transfer rules, but added that Uefa, European football's governing body, could work with global body Fifa to change the transfer market or do so via its own licensing regulations. \nHe told a conference in Lisbon that Uefa needed to address a \"decrease in competitive balance\" within European club football. \nAs the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich dominate, some of Europe's smaller leagues have complained that big teams sign up their best players at a young age, only to immediately send them on loan elsewhere. \nIn the Premier League Chelsea had more than 30 players out on loan earlier this season, while in Italy champions Juventus have more than 50 players loaned out. \n\"We cannot allow the greatness of some to overshadow and drown out the least of us,\" Ceferin added. \n\"If we allow gaps to become too great we will be neglecting those who have little opportunity. \n\"Uefa has a duty to protect the whole of football and not just the elite and not just within our competitions.\" \nCeferin also said that Uefa would set up a new division entitled \"Protection of the Game\" to tackle doping, corruption violence and match-fixing.
