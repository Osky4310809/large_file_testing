'More influential' \nThere are a number of UK universities claiming first places, in rankings based on 43 million research papers and 305,000 responses to an academic survey. \nLoughborough, which has produced a number of elite athletes, is rated as best in sports-related subjects, while Sussex is this year identified as the best for development studies, replacing Harvard. \nThe Royal College of Art is top for art and design and the Institute of Education, part of University College London, is in first place for education. \nThe University of Cambridge is rated as the most consistent - with more subjects in the top 10 than any other institution, followed by the University of California, Berkeley. \nA quarter of all top 10 rankings are taken by UK universities - with the US and UK having the biggest share of the highest places. \nAmong continental European universities, ETH Zurich was top in earth and marine sciences, while Hong Kong University was top at dentistry. \nBen Sowter, head of research for the ranking firm, says that the UK does particularly well in these rankings which \"drill down\" to subject level. \nHe said comparisons by subject were becoming more important for students considering courses. \n\"Subject rankings are becoming more and more influential,\" he said.
