Tina was a cop in Central City three years ago who was captured by a mobster. Right as the mob's boss was going to kill her partner, the particle accelerator accident (the one that gave the Flash his powers) happened, causing her to get her sonic scream. \nIn the present day, Ollie and her team are vetting candidates to become the new Black Canary. Everyone brings Ollie qualified candidates, but Ollie keeps comparing them to Laurel and finds them wanton. Finally, Curtis brings up an \"urban legend\", a roaming woman who protects crime victims across America with a sonic scream. \nOllie visits Diggle in prison, where he finds out that General Walker was previously under investigation for corruption, but that the investigation was shut down. Chase suggests that the file still exists, so Ollie says he'll have Felicity hack the NSA. \nIn a flashback, Ollie wakes up in a safehouse. Talia al Ghul reveals that she's done her homework on Ollie and says that he knew one of her students: Yao Fei. \nBack at the Arrow Cave, Curtis pulls up footage of Tina Boland in action and says she was last seen in Hub City. So, Oliver and the team suits up and heads to Hub City. They find Tina on a rooftop and offer her a spot on the team. Tina's not interested and she warns them that if they interfere, she'll send them back to Star City with their nuts in a sling. \nThe next morning, Ollie, Curtis, and Rene eat breakfast at a Big Belly Burger. Curtis figures out Tina's identity, so Oliver calls Captain Singh over in Central City for more information. After Oliver has the Flash leave a post-it note on Singh's computer to prove he's legit, Singh says that Bolland was on a deep cover assignment until her partner was killed. Afterwards, Bolland quit and hasn't been seen since. \nIn another flashback, Ollie is a little surprised that Talia trained Yao Fei since she's looks half Yao Fei's age. Talia says that Ollie is destined to be so much more than a Bratva member, but Oliver is only interested in killing Kovar. Talia gives Oliver the name and location of one of Kovar's associates and says she'll help him in exchange for hearing him out on her proposition later. \nFelicity hacks into the TSA, but finds out that Walker's file has been scrubbed, meaning they have no information. \nGreen Arrow and Wild Dog track Tina to an apartment building, where they find her torturing one of the mobsters from the beginning of the episode. When Green Arrow trys to intercede, Tina uses her sonic scream to blast him across the room and then snaps the mobster's neck with her scream. Wild Dog stops her using a sonic dampener, but it's too late: the mobster's dead. \nSome other mobsters storm the building and in the gunfire, Tina escapes through the window. While Wild Dog stops the mobsters, Oliver chases after Tina. When he catches up with her, Oliver makes a pitch: he'll help her find the man who killed her partner if she lets him help her. She's not convinced and runs away again. \nThe next morning, Curtis explains that Tina's going after Sean Sonus. Sonus arrived in Hub City to take advantage of the power vaccum left by Tobias Church's death and peddles a drug called \"Slide\" to children. Both Curtis and Rene want to let Tina kill Sonus, but Oliver understands what she's been through and wants to help. \nIn a flashback, Talia and Oliver invade Kovar's associate's headquarters, with Talia only armed with a bow. \nFelicity is scouring the Dark Web for a trace of Walker's file, and she gets a terminal message offering to help. \nCurtis hacks Hub City's camera system, so they could track either Tina OR Sonus. Rene isn't convinced that finding Tina is the right move, but Curtis convinces him that the team is all about second chances. \nTina finds Sonus, but he uses a new meta power that induces VERTIGO to take her out. Oliver and Rene show up in the nick of time, but Sonus escapes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:41:59.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
