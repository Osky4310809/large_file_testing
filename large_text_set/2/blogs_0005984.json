(Budweiser via AP) Immigration ad from Budweiser leads to some calls for boycott From staff reports ( … ) The Associated Press \nThis photo provided by Budweiser shows a scene from the company's commercial for Super Bowl 51, between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons, Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017. The scene depicts when Anheuser-Busch co-founder Adolphus Busch, foreground left, is welcomed to St. Louis after traveling by boat from Germany. (Budweiser via AP) \nSome supporters of President Trump are calling for a boycott of Budweiser because they didn't like the giant beermaker's Super Bowl ad. \nThe commercial, which aired during Sunday night's game, chronicled the journey of Adolphus Busch , its immigrant founder who came to the United States from Germany in the 1800s. \nIn the 60-second spot titled \"Born the Hard Way,\" Busch lands in the U.S. and upon arrival hears: \"You're not wanted here! Go home!\" \nA teaser for the spot began airing on Tuesday. \nAccording to Budweiser, the ad, \"Born the Hard Way,\" has nothing to do with the current political climate. Just days before the ad's release, Trump signed an executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nMarcel Marcondes, Anheuser-Busch vice president of marketing, said the commercial and its concept were in the works many months before the travel ban. He told the Post-Dispatch last week: “It’s been a long time in the making. It’s a human story, really, about hard work and overcoming challenges.” \nBut some people aren't buying it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:04:55.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
