After the sting, Planned Parenthood vowed to \"retrain\" its employees so that they would be able to identify child sex traffickers.\nHowever, a Planned Parenthood whistleblower now claims the only training that occurred was how to identify undercover journalists investigating its facilities .\nAlso, through public records requests, Live Action's investigation found that Planned Parenthood lied when it claimed it had reported the suspected sex traffickers to authorities :\nPlanned Parenthood failed repeatedly to report the suspected crimes to local police departments, state police, or even child protective services.\nFormer Sherman, Texas, Planned Parenthood manager Ramona Treviño has told the Live Action president that, after the sting videos in 2011 were released, her bosses called a meeting to train employees on how best to deal with the issue. But instead of training employees to identify and report potential sex trafficking, the training sessions instructed staff on how to identify undercover journalists and whether they were being recorded:\n“That experience for me left me so disgusted that I couldn’t see how Planned Parenthood could ever redeem themselves after that,” Treviño said after attending one of the highly publicized training seminars in 2011.\n“When confronted with child sex traffickers, Planned Parenthood cared more about protecting its image than protecting children,” said Lila Rose, president and founder of Live Action.\nThe abortion chain also claimed in 2011 that it had “been in contact with federal and local authorities” to identify Live Action’s suspected sex traffickers who had visited its facilities.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Live Action made a series of Freedom of Information Act records requests of law enforcement and child protective services in the states and cities where the alleged trafficking occurred. The responses show that out of five states and Washington, D.C., only one state -- Arizona -- had responsive records showing Planned Parenthood reported anything to authorities.\nResearch shows that about 30 percent of actual sex trafficking victims come in contact with Planned Parenthood facilities .\nIf Planned Parenthood is failing to report these real incidents to authorities, these victims may be losing any chance to escape their abusers. Dr. Laura Lederer, former senior advisor for trafficking in persons for the U.S. Department of State, reported:\n“Survivors [of human trafficking] also had significant contact with clinical treatment facilities, most commonly Planned Parenthood clinics, which more than a quarter of survivors (29.6%) visited. … Since pimps and traffickers generally exercise nearly complete control of their victims, these points of contact with healthcare represent rare opportunities for victim identification and intervention.”\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/17/video-exposes-planned-parenthoods-lies-after-sex-trafficking-sting/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://liveaction.org/learn/new-lies-planned-parenthoods-sex-trafficking-coverup/"], "published": "2017-01-17T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:03:42.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
