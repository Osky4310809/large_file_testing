Nearly every night, she says she bolted upright screaming and drenched in sweat. \nIn the morning, she sat frozen in panic, unable to put on her uniform. \n\"I'd be crying and crying ... I couldn't control it and I didn't know why,\" she recalled. \"I wished I had a broken leg. If I could've just had something that was fixable and explainable, then my recovery would have been a lot easier. Paramedic Natalie Harris, seen here in this undated handout photo, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the many disturbing calls she responded to during her career. (CP handout/Natalie Harris) \n\"Eventually, suicide was my only option to get away from the terror in my mind.\" \nHarris now knows she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the many disturbing calls she responded to during her career, including a blood-soaked motel room where a man had fatally slashed the throats of two women and tried to kill himself. \nNext month, Harris will join a group of first responders and families in the House of Commons to call for a national strategy to help Canadian paramedics, firefighters, police officers and veterans who are in crisis. 'We're going to lose more,' says MP \nCariboo-Prince George MP Todd Doherty has introduced a private member's bill that would create a framework to track the disorder, establish guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and management, and would create education materials to be used by public health providers. It is set for second reading Feb. 9. \nDoherty said he had spoken with hundreds of veterans and first responders with heartbreaking stories, as well as family members whose loved ones have died by suicide. \n\"I fear that if we don't do something, at all levels, we're going to lose more,\" he said. \nScott Bardsley, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, said the government is working on a plan to address post-traumatic stress injuries. \nIt has consulted with provinces, territories, public-safety officers and health-care practitioners, he said. \nConsultations have emphasized the need for prevention and early intervention, more research and awareness, the reduction of stigma, and an enhanced support for diagnosis, care and treatment, he said. \n\"We promised Canadians renewed federal leadership on post-traumatic stress injuries,\" he said in a statement, adding the government will formally respond to Doherty's bill at second reading Problem 'massive,' says advocate \nA national strategy should also include increased funding for psychological care, said Vince Savoia, the founder of the Tema Conter Memorial Trust. \nThe trust is named after the woman whose murder he responded to as a young paramedic in 1988. \nSince 2014, 183 Canadian public safety and military personnel have died by suicide, according to statistics kept by the organization. \nThis year, already three first responders and one veteran have killed themselves, including Lionel Desmond of Nova Scotia, who shot and killed his wife , daughter and mother before shooting himself. Shanna and Lionel Desmond hold their daughter Aaliyah in an old photo from the Facebook page of Shanna Desmond. Lionel, a veteran who had long been suffering from PTSD, is believed to have shot and killed his wife and daughter in an apparent murder-suicide in January. (Canadian Press/Facebook) \n\"We have a massive problem,\" Savoia said. \nThe organization produces its statistics through direct reporting from families and colleagues of the deceased and requires three sources to confirm a death, he said. \nNorman Traversy, a former Mississauga firefighter who will back Doherty's bill next month, said he was bullied after he was diagnosed with PTSD. \nHe provided to The Canadian Press a photograph of a sign that said \"Caged Animal\" that he alleged was placed above his cubicle. \n\"I was totally humiliated and embarrassed,\" he said. \nLindsay Noronha, a spokeswoman for the City of Mississauga, declined to discuss the terms of Traversy's employment, which ended seven years ago. Workplace injury \nBut she said the mental health of firefighters has always been a top priority and it recently introduced a new preventative program. \nOne reason some first responders want a federal framework is because workers' compensation legislation is inconsistent between provinces. \nLast year, Ontario updated its legislation to presume that PTSD is a workplace injury among first responders, a move already undertaken by Manitoba and Alberta. \nBritish Columbia still requires people applying for benefits to prove that their PTSD was caused by their job. \nShane Simpson, an Opposition NDP member of the B.C. legislature, wants to change that. He plans to reintroduce a private member's bill to update the law. \nLabour Minister Shirley Bond said the province's legislation is among the broadest in Canada and includes coverage for work-related mental disorders, including PTSD. \nWorkSafeBC, the provincial agency responsible for worker safety, said for all mental-health disorder claims that proceeded to a decision, 67 per cent of firefighters' claims were allowed, 71 per cent of police officers' claims were allowed and 47 per cent of paramedics' claims were allowed. \n\"These statistics reflect a significantly higher percentage of allowed claims for mental disorders for first responders as compared to all workers,\" said Jennifer Leyen, director of special care services. \nBob Parkinson of the Ambulance Paramedics of B.C. said the province's drug-overdose crisis has put more strain on an already pressured workforce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T03:51:06.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
