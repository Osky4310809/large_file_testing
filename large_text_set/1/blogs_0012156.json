The image of the demonic Regan became iconic among horror fans and the novel was a huge bestseller, remaining on the New York Times bestseller list for 57 straight weeks and at the No 1 spot for 17 of them. In 1973, Blatty won an Oscar for his screenplay of his own book and later wrote and directed a film sequel, 1990’s The Exorcist III. \nBorn in New York in 1928 to Lebanese immigrant parents, Blatty was raised by his devoutly Catholic mother after his father left when he was three. After completing a master’s in English literature, he worked as a door-to-door salesman for a vacuum cleaner company, a beer truck driver and as a ticket agent for United Airlines before enlisting in the US Air Force. He later joined the United States Information Agency as an editor stationed in Beirut, before leaving his career behind to focus on writing in the late 1950s. \nHis first book came in 1960, an autobiography called Which Way to Mecca, Jack? and was followed by several comic novels, including I, Billy Shakespeare (1965), and Twinkle, Twinkle, “Killer” Kane (1966). While his writing was well received by critics – Marvin Levin in the New York Times wrote: “Nobody can write funnier lines than William Peter Blatty, a gifted virtuoso who writes like (SJ) Perelman” – sales and commercial acceptance were lacking until 1971, when The Exorcist was published. \nBlatty died on Thursday, but it was announced on social media by Exorcist director William Friedkin on Friday.
