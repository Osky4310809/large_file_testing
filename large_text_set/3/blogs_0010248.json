Emma Watson is literally Belle in this yellow dress from Dior Haute Couture, and we love how she wore it to an event for children at the New York Film Society . Watson is always giving back and sharing her love of all things good , especially books — and at this event, she read passages from Beauty and the Beast. BUT back to the dress.\nIt’s a beautiful shade of creamy yellow, and she totally looks like a real-life princess! Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images We love those spaghetti straps, the low neckline, and the super flowy material. It’s playful and young, while also managing to be utterly sophisticated. Here’s Watson giving her speech up on stage in the eye-catching dress.\nDid you get a good look at the BACK?!\nYouTube/Screenslam Now that it’s getting warmer, we’re totally gonna bring back the yellow!\nWe love how Watson has been sharing her sustainable and eco-friendly outfits via her fashion Insta account The Press Tour, because it’s great to see someone with such a public platform champion such an important cause. She’s shared so many stunning looks, like this one crafted from leftover fabric from Elia Saab’s Haute Couture collection.\nA post shared by The Press Tour (@the_press_tour) on Feb 27, 2017 at 9:21am PST \nNever stop being your thoughtful, generous, and stylish self, Emma!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T18:38:30.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
