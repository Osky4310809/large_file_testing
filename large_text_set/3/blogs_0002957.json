They said a quick “hello” to Santa’s friends before warming up with some hot drinks inside, where they both gazed lovingly into each other’s eyes and admitted to being “scared” of their feelings and of rejection. Rachel called Nick “rare” for his openness, to which he replied, “I might be white, but I’m still a minority.” \nThen, in a stunt that may have taken the whole “Saint Nick” thing too far, Nick and Rachel took a reindeer-drawn sleigh ride. \nThat night, Nick counseled Rachel on opening up and Rachel finally told him she is falling in love with him. Nick said he is “falling for” her too before offering her the Fantasy Suite key and having the alone time they’d been craving.

They talked about their non-negotiables, their families and whether they would move to each other’s homes. (Both really love their homes.) \nRegardless, Vanessa told Nick she loves him and they headed to their Fantasy Suite.
