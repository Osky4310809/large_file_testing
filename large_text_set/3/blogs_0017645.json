There was a major outbreak of handbags on the pitch at the Riverside... (Photo: REUTERS) \nMarouane Fellaini and Jesse Lingard gave United a 2-0 lead, and Gestede pulled one back, before Antonio Valencia was gifted a tap in by keeper Victor Valdes’ slip. \nMourinho went straight down the tunnel after that stoppage-time goal, not hanging around for the handshakes with interim Boro boss Steve Agnew. \nUnited defender Phil Jones admitted that “emotions were high.” \nHe said: “The tunnel? I think it was a bit of frustration creeping in on their behalf. ...and security had to get involved when the action carried on in the tunnel (Photo: BT Sport) \n“It is a difficult situation. I was in it [the relegation battle] with Blackburn, so I know how they feel. When emotions are high these things happen, but it was something and nothing.” \nGestede insisted the flare-up had not been sparked by biting, and that he and Bailly were just talking. \n“We had a few words together, it was nothing major,\" said the striker. \"He gave me a hug and a kiss, that’s it. I didn’t feel anything. \n\"Ben thought he bit me, so that’s why he reacted like he did. But I told him we were just talking, there was no problem.” Gestede insisted this clash with Bailly wasn't what it looked like to his angry teammates (Photo: BT Sport) \nMourinho said of the victory: “It was a big win to keep us alive in the race for fourth position. If we didn’t win this match. we lose the chance in relation to Arsenal’s defeat and Man City v Liverpool [who drew their third v fourth game later on Sunday]. \n“Do I prefer to finish fourth or win the Europa League? I prefer to win the Europa League because it gives us the same — Champions League football — but it also gives us a trophy, prestige, a European Super Cup [final against the Champions League's winners next August]. United took the lead on the half-hour through Fellaini... (Photo: REUTERS) ...and it was 2-0 on 62 minutes, leading goal-scorer Lingard to throw some shapes (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"Maybe we don’t win the Europa League [United face a quarter-final against Belgium's Anderlecht] and have to fight until we can to try for fourth. \n“We missed many players but we had great attitude and desire from all the boys. It was a massive victory for us.” \nAsked about his axed former Real Madrid No2, Mourinho said: “Justice for Karanka is the work he did here. People cannot delete the good things. Relegation-threatened Boro had hope with 12 minutes left through Gestede...

People [there] now they don’t like me, but nobody there can delete what we did. \n“Aitor, he came here and there were 10,000 people in the stadium and they were almost going into League One. \n\"He could have left the club for better. He stayed for the fans, for the owner and for the players. He had a good opportunity to go to a bigger club.” poll loading If you could only have one, Manchester United fans... 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:35:37.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
