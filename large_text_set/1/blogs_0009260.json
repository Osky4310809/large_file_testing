(AP) \nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has the footwork of a boxer. \nHe recreated his unbelievable bob-and-weave touchdown from a Week 17 win in a wild-card playoff game against the New York Giants. Rodgers looked right, looked left, looked back right, worked around one defender and then another as he danced around. He extended the play long enough for Davante Adams to get just a little bit of separation. Rodgers has the confidence to throw it in a small window, and he hit Adams for a 5-yard touchdown to give the Packers a 7-6 lead. \n\nIt was a signature play from Rodgers, who is able to keep plays alive with his tremendous footwork. He also has a unique ability to throw with velocity without having his body set or square, and he made a really nice throw to Adams. \nThe Giants got to Rodgers a few times in the first half when he held the ball too long, waiting for his receivers to get open against the Giants’ tight coverage. But it’s hard to keep Rodgers from making one of those magical plays he’s known for, and he made a big one to Adams when Green Bay needed it. – – – – – – – \nFrank Schwab is the editor of Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.
