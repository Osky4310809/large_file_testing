Why not? We will see in a couple of years, first as an assistant coach and then manager. We’ve seen it before.” \nWhile he will be spending much of his time with Liverpool’s young hopefuls, Gerrard will still be on hand to offer advice to those who come looking for it. \nLuis Garcia believes Jordan Henderson could be among those to benefit from the presence of the ex-England skipper, with the 26-year-old having already inherited the Anfield armband, and a leadership role in the middle of the park. \nThe Spaniard added: “Even though they didn’t play the same position, with Stevie more of a box to box player, right now I can see Henderson dictating the tempo and that’s what he took from Stevie. \nLiverpool team news & likely line-up \n“How to move a team with his passes – and he has a fantastic pass – and be the second line and score important goals.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T16:32:28.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
