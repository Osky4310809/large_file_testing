McAllister, was studying criminal justice at St. Augustine’s University in Raleigh. Her family lives in the Upper Marlboro area.\nD.C. police said she and another woman were shot in the 4300 block of Benning Road NE. An aunt said McAllister was a bystander, watching a friend who was helping to film a music video. A second woman was also shot and it was not clear whether she was the friend whom the aunt referred to.\nNo motive for the attack could be learned immediately.\n“At this point,”said Dustin Sternbeck, a police spokesman, “we are not in a position to say whether she was the intended target or not.”\nMcAllister graduated last year from Largo High School in Prince George’s. School principal, Afie Mirshah, posted a Twitter message in behalf of the school mourning her loss.\nIn attending St. Augustine’s McAllister was following tradition. Her father was in the class of 1988; her sister, and McAllister’s sister, Ndaja, was also a St. Augustine’s student, according to the university president.\nIn a statement, Dr. Everett B. Ward, asked prayer for “this celebrated and respected Saint Augustine’s family, Anthony McAllister, ‘88, wife Tyreese and daughter Ndaja, ‘20, as they mourn the tremendous loss.”\nNeither the parents nor the sister could be immediately reached on Tuesday night.\nIn a Facebook posting, the aunt, Tami Dalger, who lives in New Jersey, described the family as “overwhelmed with grief.”\nShe called her niece a “lovely young lady” who was “beautiful inside and out.”\nShe was “bright, intelligent and talented,” and was “great to be around,” the aunt said.\nAn honor roll student, the aunt said, she was also in the ROTC program in high school. She liked basketball, the aunt said, and enjoyed family and friends.\nLittle information was available Tuesday night about the circumstances of the shooting.\nAn initial account from police on Monday night said that both victims appeared at first to be conscious and breathing. However, the homicide unit was alerted.\nA written police report made available Tuesday indicated that the shooting had occurred on Benning Road about 8:40 p.m. The area is northwest of the Benning Road Metro stop.\nThe report described the weapon used as a handgun was used in the shooting, but said the circumstances were unknown. The report indicates that at least two cars were damaged.\nThe Twitter feed posted by the victim’s high school principal gives a quotation that was published next to her picture in what appeared to be a school yearbook.\nIt read: “You gotta stay solid even when everybody else folds on you.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@martyweilwapost", "https://twitter.com/@postmetrogirl"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:47:25.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
