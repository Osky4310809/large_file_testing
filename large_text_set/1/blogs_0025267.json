Not a before and after. Not a weight loss transformation. Not a diet company promotion.” 01/31/2017 10:57 am ET 250 Jenna Amatulli Trends Editor, The Huffington Post \nIf you’re comparing yourself to what you scroll past on Instagram, then 23-year-old Milly Smith wants to open your eyes. \nThe U.K.-based nursing student, new mom and body positivity champion recently posted an Instagram ( @selfloveclubb ) of two drastically different side-by-side photos, taken seconds apart. \nIn the first, Smith is wearing control-top tights that give her the appearance of a flat stomach and hourglass shape. In the second photo, the tights are pulled below her stomach and the entire shape of her figure is changed. A photo posted by Milly Smith 💛🌻☀️👑 (@selfloveclubb) on Jan 29, 2017 at 10:45am PST \nSmith writes in the caption, “ Same girl, same day, same time. Not a before and after. Not a weight loss transformation. Not a diet company promotion.” \nShe elaborates that she’s comfortable with how her body looks in both images and stresses to her fans that they shouldn’t compare themselves to other people. \n“Just live for you. There is no one on this planet who’s like you and that’s pretty damn amazing don’t ya think. The world doesn’t need another copy, it needs you. We are worthy, valid and powerful beyond measure,” she says. \nThe side-by-side comparison has been done many times before, but this iteration shows just how deceptive angles and clothing can be to a silhouette. \nSmith frequently posts photos advocating body acceptance, including other side-by-sides to make a point that she (or the others she’s photographed) hasn’t lost weight between one photo and the other. It’s simply photo “magic.” A photo posted by Milly Smith 💛🌻☀️👑 (@selfloveclubb) on Jan 24, 2017 at 8:26am PST A photo posted by Milly Smith 💛🌻☀️👑 (@selfloveclubb) on Jan 16, 2017 at 1:11pm PST A photo posted by Milly Smith 💛🌻☀️👑 (@selfloveclubb) on Dec 19, 2016 at 10:38am PST \nTake a tip from Milly: Love yourself and your body, regardless of how you’re standing, sitting or posing! \nThe HuffPost Lifestyle newsletter will make you happier and healthier, one email at a time.
