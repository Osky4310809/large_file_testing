And now that those ties seem to be growing ever stronger, including today’s allegations that a Trump aide laundered money from a pro-Moscow party , those emails sure are feeling like a whole lot of nothing. \nThe irony was not lost on Twitter, naturally: When you're right, ConJob, you're right. https://t.co/VPxb2GgzGh \n— Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) March 20, 2017 \nEnter this into: \"Tweets that haven't aged well\" https://t.co/WW4fQAL2au \n— Siraj Hashmi (@SirajAHashmi) March 20, 2017 \n@KellyannePolls me reading this tweet like… pic.twitter.com/SILdJFrOCO \n— Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) March 20, 2017 \nThis tweet didn’t age very well. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/hMYHyHwOad \n— SpinDoctor (@SpinDr) March 20, 2017 \nHello ironic old Tweet, how are ya? https://t.co/vzKfuuHPEg \n— Kevin Phelan (@KPhed) March 20, 2017 \nLife comes at you fast, right @KellyannePolls ? #TrumpRussia https://t.co/ZVd5C3Qb34 \n— Cole Ledford (@ColeLedford11) March 20, 2017 \n. @KellyannePolls well this tweet certainly hasn’t aged well ??? \n— Jordan (@jordansdiamonds) March 20, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:06:21.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
