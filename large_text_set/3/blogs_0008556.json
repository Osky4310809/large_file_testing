Per Laurie K. Blandford and Jon Santucci of TCPalm.com, citing a police report, Thompson was arrested and charged on Feb. 28 on the day of a Mets spring training game against the Detroit Tigers . Blandford and Santucci noted members of the Mets staff noticed a woman who was later identified as Thompson on Feb. 26 \" hanging around the complex since early in the morning and asking questions about Tebow, who had arrived that day for Minor League Baseball camp.\" When officers asked Thompson her reason for being there, she claimed to be in a relationship with Tebow. Tebow addressed the issue after the Mets' game Friday against the Atlanta Braves . \"I wish her the best and just pray for her,\" he said, via ESPN's Katie Strang . \"I want her to get as much help as she needs as possible, but at the same time you learn to try to compartmentalize. It's not always easy, but it's something you have to try to do as an athlete.\" Strang also noted a spokesperson for the public defender's office said, \" Thompson's case was continued until April 7 but that she hoped 'to resolve the case prior to or at that time.'\" Tebow is taking part in spring training with the Mets after he was signed to a minor league contract last September. He has appeared in two games for the team, going 0-for-7 with three strikeouts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T07:46:42.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
