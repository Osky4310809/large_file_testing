Those are some of my favorite stories to take on (if you can even really call them that), so I was happy to oblige.\nI was thinking of making one of these masks, but as I was going to print it out, I accidentally gazed into Ignis' soul-piercing eyes for too long and forgot what I was doing. Once I came to my senses, I remembered how truly awful I am at cutting paper. Wouldn't want to butcher his exquisite spiked hair.\nFinal Fantasy XV [Twitter]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:17:15.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
