Mikael Granlund passed from the right faceoff circle to Nino Niederreiter in the slot, and he passed to Koivu low in the right circle for the slap shot that beat Lehtonen. Koivu’s status for the game after recovering from an illness was uncertain until after he skated Tuesday morning. \nThe Stars got on the scoreboard at 9:38 of the second on their own 2-on-1 break.

Benn passed the puck across the goal mouth. It deflected off defenseman Marco Scandella into the air, and Eaves batted it into the net. \nNotes: The Wild had won in overtime at Dallas just 10 days earlier. . . .
