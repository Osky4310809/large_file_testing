When cutting back on processed animal foods, quitting cheese is often the hurdle that most people struggle with. We’ve all heard (or said) “but I could never give up cheese ” before, and we understand why it’s so difficult. Who would ever want to ditch mac and cheese, pizza, grilled cheese, calzones, and other wonderfully cheesy creations? But here’s the thing: even if you decide to cut back on dairy, you don’t have to break up with cheese . It also doesn’t mean that you have to opt for less-than-stellar store-bought vegan cheese options. “Cheese” shreds that turn into an oily mess when we try to make vegan pizza? Pfft! No, thank you. \nSo, what’s a dairy-ditching cheese lover to do? Well, thanks to Mexico City-based food blogger/biomedical engineer Azucena Noriega , you can make your own. Check out the mouth-watering grilled “mozzarella” cheese sandwich below. Gooey, cheesy, delicious, and it’s made with cashews instead of dairy … Wh t??? This melty vegan “cheese” will save you from a sad, grilled cheese-less life after dairy. …And hello, you can also use it to make vegan Caprese salad. Dream. Come. True. \n\nYou’re probably thinking that you need to be a master chef (or biomedical engineer) to successfully make this — but it’s actually ridiculously easy. All you need is raw cashews, water, lemon juice, salt, and one magic ingredient: psyllium husk, a form of fiber made from the Plantago ovata plant. Once you’ve got the goods, just blend soaked cashews with psyllium that’s been mixed with water and all the other ingredients, then refrigerate it. Yes, it’s that easy! Click here to get the full recipe and details … for the only mozzarella you’ll ever need until the end of time. To see Azucena’s other vegan recipes, check out her blogger page here . \nIf you love cheese or just food in general, check out the Food Monster App (available for both iPhone and Android ), where you can try all kinds of vegan cheese recipes (from sharp cheddar to gruyere)!
