Snow is expected to continue until Thursday afternoon with accumulation reaching 6 to 12 inches in some areas. \nWinds out of the northeast will be between 10 and 20 mph, at times reducing visibility to less than a quarter of a mile and making travel hazardous, especially during the Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning commutes, the weather service said. Weather \n“It can make driving very hazardous, driving slow and being cautious is definitely advised,” said Natalie Gusack, a meteorologist with the weather service in Boulder. \nAbout an inch of snow is expected in Denver Wednesday morning with up to 6 more inches falling before midnight and an additional 3 inches Thursday morning, Gusack said. \n“It’s possible for Denver to see up to 10 inches if we see the maximum forecast amounts,” Gusack said. “We’ll see how the snow bands actually play out.” \nThe snow and freezing temperatures — playing into the lore of frigid “stock show weather” — led the National Western to cancel the annual Stock Show Parade across downtown Denver Thursday because of risk of injury to animals and people. The parade will not be rescheduled. But the annual barbecue lunch in the atrium of the Wells Fargo Building at 17th and Broadway will go on as planned, 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. \nThe Colorado Department of Transportation said Tuesday that its storm preparation will include spraying roads with an anti-icing brine of rock salt and water cut with a corn-derived sugar that reduces corrosion by 70 percent compared to straight salt. The corrosion inhibitor is biodegradable and not harmful to watersheds, CDOT said. \nMotorists in the Denver area can expect to see trucks spraying this anti-icing solution on roads and highways about eight to 10 hours before snow begins, CDOT said in a media release.
