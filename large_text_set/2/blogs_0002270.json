More by Nick Vadala Arrow icon \nThis week, nights at La Peg in Old City will get a little cooler — and more tipsy — with the debut of Pegsicle, a temporary ice bar. \nPegsicle debuts Wednesday, Feb. 1 at La Peg (at the foot of Race Street at Columbus Boulevard), and will be in place through Feb. 13, providing it doesn’t melt before then. La Peg chef-owner Peter Woolsey, whom a release calls an \"amateur ice carver,\" will carve the bar out of 16 blocks of ice using Japanese ice chisels and chainsaws. \nIn addition to carving the bar, which will include a shot luge, Woolsey also designed it in a hand-drawn sketch: La Peg Handout A hand-drawn sketch shows Pegsicle, which comes to La Peg on Wednesday, Feb. 1. \nThe ice bar will be located in La Peg’s Haas Biergarten, which features fire pits to keep folks from getting too cold. Pegsicle also will be open for La Peg’s Big Game Hot Chicken Pop-Up event on Sunday, Feb. 5. \nThe outdoor bar will have drinks available, including mulled wine and alcoholic hot cocoa, and craft beer from breweries including Sly Fox, Oskar Blues, and others. The menu is as follows: \nHot Drinks ($7): \nSpiked hot chocolate (choice of Kahlua, peppermint schnapps, or tequila) \nCocktails ($7): \nRum daiquiri (white rum, lime, sugar) Moscow Mule (vodka, ginger beer, lime, bitters) Celery Tonic (gin, celery juice, tonic, lemon) \nCanned beers and ciders ($5): \nSly Fox 113 IPA Oskar Blues Old Chub Scotch Ale Blackbird Cider Works Apple Cider \nWine ($7): ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:06:56.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
