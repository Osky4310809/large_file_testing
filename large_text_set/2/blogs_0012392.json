(Photography: Mikael Jansson for Vogue US March 2017. Karlie Kloss appears in ‘Spirited Away’ editorial) More Really, Vogue ?! Karlie Kloss ‘s Japanese-inspired photo shoot in the March 2017 issue of Vogue, which purportedly celebrates the differences in women , has the Internet screaming cultural appropriation, as the American-born supermodel is styled as a what appears to be a Geisha – a traditional Japanese entertainer. Kloss is draped in Kimono-style robes with her hair adorned in kanzashi (traditional Japanese hair ornaments) while posing in a variety of settings. In many, her skin is deeply powered in the dramatic traditional style . In one photo, the 24-year-old poses with a sumo wrestler and in another she stands regally on the steps of a traditional Japanese tea house. The spread was shot at Ise-Shima National Park, Japan, by Swedish fashion photographer Mikael Jansson and styled by Phyllis Posnick.

One Twitter user wrote : “Emma Stone, Scarlett Johansson, and Tilda Swinton turn to Karlie Kloss. “Your turn, girl.” Karlie on phone: “Hello, Vogue? Make me Asian.” Another stated : “Karlie Kloss was styled as a geisha in the March issue of Vogue––the theme of which is “diversity.” This is not what diversity looks like.” “Someone at vogue really thought “this issues gonna be about diversity,” a user tweeted . “so we’re gonna take karlie kloss and dress her up as a geisha” Karlie on phone: “Hello, Vogue? Make me Asian.” pic.twitter.com/zgUWIB022Q \n— Ira Madison III (@ira) February 14, 2017 Hey, Vogue: Embracing diversity does not mean styling Karlie Kloss as a geisha https://t.co/GnW04ejz4v pic.twitter.com/LZSQzIF3eb \n— The Cut (@TheCut) February 14, 2017 is that karlie kloss photo shoot really called “SPIRITED AWAY” hahahahah someone at vogue watched one miyazaki film https://t.co/ms5z9rXDvt pic.twitter.com/EF0NuvuMVu \n— Susan Cheng (@scheng_) February 14, 2017 Karlie Kloss was styled as a geisha in the March issue of Vogue––the theme of which is “diversity.” \nThis is not what diversity looks like. pic.twitter.com/aZixgzJsq9", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:33:01.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
