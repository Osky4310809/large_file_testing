According to the Beijing Evening News , each washroom average four rolls of toilet paper, compared to 20 rolls before.\nBut some have reported that the facial recognition process — which is supposed to take three seconds — can take up to a few minutes, and that it has not been reliable.\nSome Weibo users have also responded with incredulity.\n\"To be honest, 60cm is a bit too little,\" said a user.\nImage: Ng Yi Shu/mashable\nTheThiefGuanYuPlays6: \"What, so do these people bring the toilet paper home to make mummies for their whole family?\"\nImage: NG YI SHU/MASHABLE\n\"It seems the uses of facial recognition software are pretty diverse,\" said Wangtuntun.\nImage: NG YI SHU/MASHABLE\nLuLusFishFood: \"Being civilised isn't just something you talk about — you need to act. Some people clearly have the money to buy toilet paper, but they have to take paper from public toilets. Is your face worth that money?\"\nImage: NG YI SHU/MASHABLE\nBeiErLovesBooks: \"Of course people will get more toilet paper, because they're too thin! What if your passwords are all stolen because you got yourself some toilet paper?\"\nToilet paper thieving has been a problem at the Temple of Heaven. In early March, the Beijing Evening News published photos from hidden cameras , which showed people — mainly senior citizens — visiting all seven toilets in the Temple of Heaven and stashing toilet paper into their bags.\nThe average use time of a roll of TP at the Temple of Heaven was a mere 14 minutes in 2013, according to the Beijing Youth Daily.\nThe system is still in its trial period, say temple management. The trial — which will last about two weeks — is being monitored by various smaller parks in the city, but there are no plans to bring the facial recognition machines to other parks.\nWATCH: This ingenious toilet paper tray will keep your iPhone safe in the bathroom", "external_links": ["http://www.weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404087058741217036", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Rz4rV9FJGq9jOFT0GvTeIjg5ZrI=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419064%2F51f87097-86af-4410-8219-9a03e93fc0ff.png", "http://xw.qq.com/cmsid/2013100500047000", "http://www.weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309351000174080841176309673", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/DmTbrHX3.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GmkU8Pqzt8dO-LlAj6zSGfPm30c=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419130%2F199ef384-05d9-4327-82fd-db6ff56a95cd.png", "http://www.weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309351000484086961383071275", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/DmTbrHX3.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NgtKuJ97nUgwvVLEfn5ISQwngNY=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419143%2F2b148f2a-ec6b-45aa-9fd9-323df6765628.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-ZrGuYc2LKkrwdRY6O-gnJ4D1Xk=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419143%2F2b148f2a-ec6b-45aa-9fd9-323df6765628.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fdipm67BVcBA6hMn_DLw57UDVWc=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419064%2F51f87097-86af-4410-8219-9a03e93fc0ff.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rhkFH3Sy3hWr7tmN5VLd5Sc0KT4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419128%2F5584213e-463c-47f3-ba72-de3f0b8c8cba.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/z-4p1CqMm_7AkBUvyJl712zyFF8=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419124%2Fab49dc67-ac31-42d2-810f-86fed9634856.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ulgpOqBWQpknV2DPtw-o1K0uMJk=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419128%2F5584213e-463c-47f3-ba72-de3f0b8c8cba.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oR8fL_Hy9JwhkrvXR8GG2U_UZzs=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419124%2Fab49dc67-ac31-42d2-810f-86fed9634856.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nCPMwIbbcNUmxn5WmiB6tAAo-eA=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419130%2F199ef384-05d9-4327-82fd-db6ff56a95cd.png"], "published": "2017-03-20T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T09:51:00.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
