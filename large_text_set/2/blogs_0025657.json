(PTI) \nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday slammed Bharatiya Janata Party’s student wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad for allegedly threatening Kargil Martyr’s daughter Gurmehar Kaur. Speaking to media, Kejriwal said BJP ’s politics of Gunda-Gardi has been exposed, “Sablog dekh rahe hain, ye BJP ke log pehle khud hi Bharat virodhi naare lagvate hain, fir khud ABVP ke gundo ko bhej ke students ki pitaai karvate hain,(Everyone can see, these BJPians first organise anti-India slogans, then send ABVP goons and thrash other students).” \nAlso Watch | Ramjas Protest: Security Tightened Outside Delhi University Ahead Of Protest March At Khalsa College \nThe Delhi CM added that BJP has created a sense of fear among students, “Parents are terrified about their children going to colleges, anytime BJP goons will come and thrash them.” \nKejriwal’s statement came after MoS Home Kiren Rijiju had issued a media statement over the instance. Earlier, MoS Home Kiren Rijuju had said that creating a controversy over Gurmehar Kaur’s statement “isn’t right”. “During war between India & China they (left) supported China; they mislead the youth and it is not right,” Rijiju said. “She(Gurmehar Kaur) is a young girl, creating controversy over her isn’t right. Its about leftists who celebrate when our jawans die,” Rijiju added. Earlier, Rijiju had questioned Gurmehar’s claims that it wasn’t Pakistan but war, that killed her father. Rijiju said that India never attacked any nation but was always on the receiving end of the hatred. He posted a tweet saying, “Who’s polluting this young girl’s mind? A strong Arm Force prevents a war. India never attacked anyone but a weak India was always invaded.” He posted a tweet saying, “Who’s polluting this young girl’s mind?
