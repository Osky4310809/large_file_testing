(AP/Kamil Krzaczynski) After being traded from the Boston Celtics in 2014, Rajon Rondo had a fall out from the Dallas Mavericks and did not seem to be the right fit for the Sacramento Kings. The feisty point guard has since moved on as a member of the Chicago Bulls this season, but it seems like he could once again be headed to his fifth team in just three seasons. The one-time NBA champion and four-time All-Star has fallen out of the rotation as of late and has already caught the ire of head coach Fred Hoiberg. ADVERTISEMENT He did not play for the entirety of the Bulls’ loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on New Year’s eve, and was once again relegated to the bench on Monday’s (Tuesday in Manila) victory against the Charlotte Hornets. READ: ‘Phenomenal’ Butler does it with 52 points for Bulls The demotion did not sit well with the former Kentucky product and will “absolutely” request a trade if the coach continues to keep him out of the rotation, according to the Chicago Tribune . “He told me that I’ve been looking slow the last five games,” Rondo detailed his conversation with the former Iowa State bench boss. “I disagree. But that’s part of it. He’s the head coach. And we’re going to go with that,” he added. Despite clashing horns over Rondo’s lack of playing time, Hoiberg still lauded his guard’s professionalism regarding the delicate matter. “I’ll say this about Rajon, he’s handled this as well as he possibly can in this type of situation,” Hoiberg said. After somehow regaining his pre-injury form with Sacramento last year, Rondo signed a two-year deal worth $27 million prior this season. However, the 30-year-old’s disappointing averages of 4.9 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 7.3 assists, while shooting just 29.6 percent has forced Hoiberg to play Michael Carter-Williams and Jerian Grant in his stead. Rondo’s struggles deeply affect the team, which has dropped two games below .500 with a 5-11 win-loss record in December.
