Daniels collects a fine pass from Pugh and he sends a dangerous low ball into the box, but Afobe's shot on the turn is blocked by Reid. 44' A rare relative period of calm before the half as the home side enjoy a spell of possession in the middle of the park. 42' Antonio attacks the ball from the resulting corner and his header looks to be going goalwards, but it strikes an unaware Cook and is cleared by the home side. 41' CHANCE! Feghouli latches on to Kouyate's pass in the inside right channel and has space to fire at goal. It's heading towards the bottom corner, only for Boruc to make a fine stop with his feet. 40' Noble releases Antonio down the left and he almost gets the wrong side of Francis, but the defender just does enough to stop his strike. 37' Randolph makes the save by guessing the right way, although it was fairly routine. 37' Missed Penalty Benik AfobeMISS! INCREDIBLE! Bournemouth miss their second spot-kick of the match as Afobe tamely strikes the ball and it allows Randolph to make a comfortable save. An awful penalty. 36' PENALTY TO BOURNEMOUTH! The Cherries have their second penalty of the day as referee Madley points to the spot as Pugh is brought down by Fonte. 35' Daniels lifts the resulting free-kick into the box, but it's a disappointing cross from the full-back, sending the ball straight down Randolph's throat. 34' Yellow Card Pedro Mba Obiang AvomoObiang brings down King for the second time his afternoon and this time he does get booked. 32' Important time in the game for the Cherries - they cannot afford to switch off again. 31' Goal Joshua KingGOA !!! KING EQUALISES! The forward atones for his miss from the spot as he gets his side back on level terms. It's a fine strike from King as he lifts the ball over Fonte in the box before fending off the West Ham defender to bury his left-footed strike past Randolph. 29' CHANCE! Cook attacks the resulting corner and has a free header 12 yards from goal, but Randolph is able turn his effort over the bar. 29' SAVE! Fraser goes for goal from distance and powers an effort towards the bottom corner, forcing Randolph into a fine stop low to his right. 28' The Cherries come forward through Fraser as he jinks past three West Ham defenders, but as he shapes to shoot the white shirts close around him, forcing a pass out wide to Pugh. 26' Lanzini lifts a ball over the top of the Cherries defence for Antonio to chase with Francis. However, the Bournemouth skipper does well under pressure to calmly bring the ball away. 25' CHANCE! Lanzini sends Antonio into the left inside channel and the winger cuts back to feed the Argentine. He goes for the first-time strike, only to lift his effort over the bar. 24' OVER! Boruc punches Lanzini's cross away from the six-yard box, but Feghouli is able to collect and fire a first-time effort at goal. However, his effort goes well over the bar. 23' Smith was penalised against United for a handball and is caught again as he blocks Cresswell's cross. Lanzini will get a chance to send the ball into the box. 22' Kouyate raids forward from the back, and although he beats three Bournemouth defenders, he cannot dig out a cross and is forced to settle for a throw-in. 20' CHANCE! Obiang finds Feghouli with a crisp pass upfield and the midfielder once again tees up Antonio for a strike. He meets the ball with a solid contact, but can only fire his strike wide of the post. 19' West Ham clear the danger from the resulting free-kick, but the Cherries are still continiuing to attack the visitors. There's been no let up since conceding the opener. 18' King goes on a surge through the middle, but he gets his ankles clipped by Obiang, who escapes a booking. 16' CLOSE! Pugh sends Daniels into the left inside channel and he fires the ball across the face of goal, but his cross proves to be too powerful for King to meet in the six-yard box. 14' A long ball over the top finds Afobe between the two West Ham centre-backs, but as he lobs his effort over Randolph - the referee spots that he used his hand to control the ball and awards a free-kick to the Hammers. 13' Daniels tries an ambitious strike from distance, but can only scuff his strike well over the bar. 12' Noble slides in late on Gosling, but does not receive a second booking. He's walking a fine line now though. 10' Goal Michail AntonioGOALLL!!!! ANTONIO PUNISHES BOURNEMOUTH! A hammer blow - forgive the pun. West Ham raid to the other end of the pitch after the penalty miss and Feghouli tees up Antonio in the box. He turns on his left foot to strike and his effort creeps into the bottom corner. 10' Feghouli makes a strong run before finding Antonio on the edge of the box. 9' Missed Penalty Joshua KingMISS!

Daniels is hauled to the ground by Feghouli and the referee points to the spot. 7' Bournemouth have made a strong start to the game and are putting the Hammers under pressure with their passing game. 5' Pugh keeps the ball alive from Fraser's shot and sends a deep cross to the back post for Afobe to attack. The striker rises highest in the box, only to guide his header wide of the post. 5' Afobe raids into the channel before sending the ball back to Fraser on the edge. He goes for the strike, but he pulls his strike wide of the post. 3' King collects the ball and then cuts it back on the edge of the box for Pugh, only for Kouyate to make an important intervention. 2' Fraser makes a run down the left and he stands a cross up to the back post, but the visitors are able to clear the danger. 1' We're underway at Dean Court. The players are making their way out on to the pitch, so we should be underway shortly. STAT ATTACK! West Ham are unbeaten in their last three trips to Bournemouth, including their 3-1 at Dean Court last season. West Ham make one change from their defeat to Chelsea, with Michail Antonio restored to the line-up following his suspension, sending Robert Snodgrass to the bench. Tyrone Mings begins his first game of his five-match suspension for his stamp on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, while Surman also serves his ban this afternoon. Simon Francis comes back into the side after an injury lay-off and Gosling replaces Surman in the middle of the park. West Ham subs: Snodgrass, Adrian, Collins, Ayew, Byram, Masuaku, Fernandes. WEST HAM (4-2-3-1): Randolph; Kouyate, Fonte, Reid, Cresswell; Obiang, Noble; Feghouli, Lanzini, Antonio; Carroll. Bournemouth subs: Gradel, Smith, Allsop, Mousset, Wilshere, Ibe, Cargill. BOURNEMOUTH (4-2-3-1): Boruc; Smith, Francis, Cook, Daniels; Gosling, Arter; Pugh, King, Fraser; Afobe. The team news has been announced and we'll start with the home side. A win this afternoon could take them into the top half of the Premier League and considering their woes early in the campaign - it would be a good sign heading into the final throes of the season. West Ham were well beaten by Chelsea in their clash on Monday. The 2-1 scoreline does not highlight the Blues' dominance in the contest, with Manuel Lanzini notching a late consolation goal for the Hammers. Eddie Howe's men needed the result against United, although they are still without a win in their last eight Premier League games, conceding 21 goals in the process. A victory is imperative to ease their relegation worries. The Cherries earned a valuable point last time out against Manchester United, despite being reduced to 10 men at the end of the first half when Andrew Surman was dismissed. Good afternoon and welcome to the live commentary of the Premier League clash between Bournemouth and West Ham at Dean Court.
