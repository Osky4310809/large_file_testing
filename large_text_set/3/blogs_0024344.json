Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester United are in pole position to land Ajax whizkid Daishawn Redan, after the Dutch giants confirmed he will be leaving this summer. \nRedan, who only turned 16 last month, has been monitored by United for over a year. \nThe Red Devils believed that they had missed out on the striker young star last month, after Redan declared he would “definitely” sign a new contract at the Amsterdam ArenA. \nHowever those talks have stalled in recent weeks, with Redan wanting a first-team guarantee for next season - and Ajax refusing to hand him one. \nNow the young striker, a Dutch Under-17 international, will leave the club this summer.

We wish him all the best with the rest of his career.” \nRedan, who has been with Ajax since the age of eight, was first brought to the attention of United during Louis van Gaal’s reign, by scout Henny De Regt. Redan has shone for Ajax at youth level (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nIn December he was invited to the club’s Carrington training ground and talks over a potential switch, as United looked to tap into the path that has taken both Millen Baars and Timothy Fosu-Mensah from Amsterdam to Manchester. \nAnd while there is also reported interest from RB Leipzig and Paris Saint-Germain, Redan has this week admitted that a move to Old Trafford particularly appeals. \n\"I hear a lot of rumours around me and I will not deny that there are clubs that are interested,\" he told Voetbal International. \n“Manchester United is a very nice and good club of course and I must admit that I am interested in an adventure like that.\" poll loading Who will win the Europa League? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T21:45:44.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
