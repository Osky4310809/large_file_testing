According to Nielsen data from Bloomberg , Trump’s inauguration drew 31 million viewers nationwide. While that figure is greater than the TV draw for the inaugurations of Bill Clinton and both George H.W. and George W. Bush, it is still almost 11 million short of the record set by Ronald Reagan in 1981, and 7 million short of Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009.

Metro — which stand at approximately 550,000 total riders this past Friday while counting 782,000 on Inauguration Day 2013, according to The Washington Post. \nSpicer’s figure of 317,000 for Obama’s second inauguration matches a D.C. Metro tweet which posted that figure as the total number of riders counted by 11 a.m., not for the whole day. \nMetro Ridership: As of 11am, 193k trips taken so far today. (11am 1/20/13 = 317k, 11am 1/20/09 = 513k, 11am 1/20/05 = 197k) #wmata Also Read: CNN Slams Trump's Press Secretary: 'Just Because Sean Spicer Says Something Doesn't Make It True' \nSpicer’s press conference received criticism from the media and former WH press secretaries. \n“This is called a statement you’re told to make by the President. And you know the President is watching,” adding, “So, while press is stunned & can’t believe it, Sean is getting praised by his boss & co-workers now. MSM is from Venus. WH is from Mars.” This is called a statement you're told to make by the President.

He is a failure in this job on his first full day. \n— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) January 21, 2017 \nOn Fox News, commentator Charles Krauthammer said Spicer’s statement was “ just plain weird .” \n“The press secretary had to be called out on what had to be an emergency,” Krauthammer said. “We were going to do it on Monday and we moved it up…and it is basically over ratings.” Also Read: Donald Trump's Press Secretary Already Hard at Work Cleaning Up Nuclear 'Arms Race' Mess (Video) \nKrauthammer compared the press conference to Trump’s tweets last week taunting Arnold Schwarzenegger over his low ratings as Trump’s replacement to host “Celebrity Apprentice.” Krauthammer called the president’s tweets about TV ratings “an obsession that is not terribly healthy.” \nCheck out Spicer’s entire press conference in the video above . Best Signs From the Women's March (Updating Photos) \nMillions of people worldwide have taken to the streets to celebrate their rights and protest Donald Trump's presidency. Signs and slogans condemned Trump's comments about women, minorities, Muslims, the LGBT community and the GOP's plans to crack down on undocumented Americans and Planned Parenthood. TheWrap/Matt Pressberg \nCats and cat ears were everywhere, in answer to Trump's 2005 \"grab 'em by the pussy\" remark. TheWrap/Matt Pressberg \nTens of thousands gathered in Pershing Square in Los Angeles beginning in the early morning. TheWrap/Tim Molloy \nTrains into downtown Los Angeles were packed. Miles from downtown, at the Hollywood and Highland stop, a Wrap reporter was unable to board three trains because they were too full, and finally took one going in the wrong direction to get to a less-crowded train going downtown. TheWrap/Tim Molloy \nMany signs used ovaries as symbols of power and resistance. TheWrap/Matt Pressberg \nThe LA. march went from Pershing Square to Grand Park, located adjacent to City Hall. TheWrap/Matt Pressberg \nMany had only sympathy for Melania Trump. TheWrap/Tim Molloy \nThe words \"Free Melania\" came up a lot. Itay Hod/TheWrap \nMen stood by the women of the U.S. in solidarity. TheWrap/Tim Molloy \nA doctored emoji illustrated this petitioner's words. TheWrap/Tim Molloy \nMore cats, with their claws proudly out. TheWrap/Tim Molloy \nCarrie Fisher lived on in marchers' hearts as Princess Leia became a symbol of resistance. TheWrap/Tim Molloy \n... and she brought The Force with her. Itay Hod/TheWrap \nYou're probably right about that. Facebook \nA big theme: hands off. And rosaries off, too. Itay Hod/TheWrap \nMany Hillary Clinton quotes made their way into the festivities. Itay Hod/TheWrap \nPink hats, cat ears and pink hats with cat ears were very popular.
