Could   \nDevious Myra Hindley told police that she “can’t stand blood” and was never present when the five Moors Murders victims died. \nThe warped killer’s bid to distance herself from the horror came in interviews 20 years after the murders . \nBut Hindley also told Det Chief Supt Peter Topping in 1987 she was “as guilty” as accomplice Ian Brady as she helped lure the children who died. \nThe revelations come in 700 pages of interviews uncovered by Moors Murders expert Darren Rae. \nHindley was quizzed as police mounted a new bid to find the bodies of three victims of the 1960s killings.

A body of one of the murderous pair's victims is taken off the moors Darren Rae at the shrine to Keith Bennett (Photo: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror) \nDarren also said he had found shells matching a gun owned by Brady on Saddleworth Moor, Gtr Manchester. \nHe is convinced Brady shot 12-year-old Keith Bennett there. \nThe interviews with Topping were conducted at Cookham Wood jail in Kent. Hindley died in 2002, aged 60. \nShe and Brady were jailed for life in 1966 over the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, John Kilbride and Edward Evans. Darren on the moors (Photo: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror) \nIn 1985 Brady – still held at Ashworth Hospital, Merseyside – confessed to murdering Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, 12. \nDarren is writing a book – Finding Keith? The Definitive Investigation into the Moors Murders – which fully ­documents his new evidence. Keith Bennett, 12 12 year old Keith Bennett (Photo: PA) \nYoung Keith Bennett was lured on to the Moors “like a lamb to the slaughter”, Hindley told police. \nThe 12-year-old’s body has never been found after she and Brady kidnapped him in June 1964. \nHindley told how Brady was hiding in the back of their van as they went out looking for a victim. \nThey spotted Keith and Brady tapped Hindley. “I knew he would,” she told police. Pauline Reade was 16 when she was killed (Photo: PA) Joan Reade mother of Moors Murder victim Pauline Reade \nShe asked Keith if he would help carry boxes from a wine shop. \nShe told police chief Topping: “The awful thing is about all these children they never queried anything, probably because of me being a woman that they didn’t have any fear or anything.” \nAt Saddleworth Moor Keith got out of the van and “just went like a little lamb to the slaughter”, she said. Victim John Kilbride, 12 (Photo: PA) \nHindley stood on lookout for 40 minutes while Brady strangled Keith and buried him “a long, long walk” from the road. \nShe told of a letter from Keith’s mum Winnie Johnson. Hindley said: “I can’t put into words how I feel that Keith Bennett’s body can’t be found.” \nWinnie died in 2012. Lesley Ann Downey, 10 Lesley-Ann Downey, 10 (Photo: PA) \nTerrified Lesley Ann Downey was taped pleading for her mum as she was abused and tortured. \nThe 10-year-old was snatched from a fairground in December 1964 after Brady said he wanted to “do blue photographs”. \nHindley said: “He said we would bring whoever it was back to the house to do blue photographs which he said he would sell. \n\"These children who we killed, they could have been anybody, if it hadn’t been them it would have been someone else.” \nOf Lesley Ann, Hindley added: “She was crying and screaming and I know I should have tried to protect the child to comfort her. \n\"I didn’t, I was cruel and I was brusque and I told her to shut up because I was frightened that people would hear and I panicked. It was just like a nightmare. \n“She was terrified out of her life, frightened to death, she was hysterical. \n“I don’t have no defence.” \nHindley claimed she was running a bath for Lesley Ann when Brady strangled the youngster. Edward Evans, 17 Edward Evans, 17-year-old murder victim of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley (Photo: PA) \nHindley tried to implicate her brother-in-law over the axe murder of final victim Edward Evans. \nIn the interviews she claimed David Smith was involved in killing Edward, 17, who Brady had lured back to his house in October 1965. \nHindley told Topping there was a fight between Brady and Evans. \nShe said: “I heard a sound like a chair crashing across the floor, scraping across the floor. \n\"I looked through the hatch and saw Ian and Edward Evans struggling with each other. I ran into the hallway and I shouted ‘Dave, help him’.” \nShe claimed Smith ran to the living room, adding: “All hell let loose... there was screaming. When it stopped everywhere was just one complete pool of blood. \n“I couldn’t go in because I cannot stand blood and I can’t bear it. I ran into the kitchen and was horribly sick.” \nAfter cleaning up the mess she told police how they sat drinking tea while planning how to dispose of the body. \nIn reality, Smith was not involved in the murder. He alerted police – leading to the capture of Brady and Hindley.
