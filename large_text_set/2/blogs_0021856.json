William Owens talks about his son, Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens, who was killed during a raid in Yemen. (Emily Michot / Miami Herald/TNS) Associated Press \nThe father of a Navy SEAL killed during an anti-terrorism raid in Yemen is demanding an investigation into its planning and has criticized the Trump administration for its timing. \nBill Owens told the Miami Herald in a story published Sunday that he refused to meet with President Donald Trump when both came to Dover Air Force Base to receive the casket carrying his son, Chief Special Warfare Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens. \n\"I want an investigation,\" said Owens, a retired Fort Lauderdale police detective and veteran. \"The government owes my son an investigation.\" \nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday she believes the president would support an investigation. \n\"I can't imagine what this father is going through,\" she said. \"His son is a true American hero, and we should forever be in his son's debt.\" \nThe younger Owens, a 36-year-old married father of three, was the lone U.S. fatality in the Jan. 28 raid on a suspected Al Qaeda compound. Approximately 16 civilians and 14 militants died in the raid, which the Pentagon said was aimed at capturing information on potential Al Qaeda attacks against the U.S. and its allies. \nThe elder Owens told the Herald he refused to meet with the president because the family had requested a private ceremony. \n\"I'm sorry, I don't want to see him,\" Owens recalled telling the chaplain who informed him that Trump was on his way from Washington. \"I told them I don't want to meet the president.\" \nHe said he was also troubled by the attack Trump leveled at Khizr and Ghazala Khan, an American Muslim family whose Army officer son died in Iraq in 2004. The couple had criticized him at the Democratic National Convention last summer. He also questioned why the president approved the raid a week after taking office. \n\"I told them I didn't want to make a scene about it, but my conscience wouldn't let me talk to him,\" Owens told the Herald. \"Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn't even barely a week into his administration? Why? For two years prior, there were no boots on the ground in Yemen — everything was missiles and drones — because there was not a target worth one American life. Now, all of a sudden we had to make this grand display?\" \nSanders defended the raid in her interview with \"This Week\" host George Stephanopoulos. The White House said the raid was planned during the Obama administration, but the former president's aides have said he hadn't given the go-ahead because it would have been an escalation of U.S. involvement in the war-torn and destitute Arab country. \n\"The mission has a lot of different critics, but it did yield a substantial amount of very important intel and resources that helped save American lives and other lives,\" Sanders said.
