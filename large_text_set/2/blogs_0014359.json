Harrison, a very accomplished pilot, was actually able to safely land the plane so it was more of a THUD than a CRASH, and while he left the scene injured, he was in stable condition.\nNow, almost two years later, he’s once again involved in a plane near-miss, but this one actually involves another plane. According to reports, Harrison was given clearance to land at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, but instead of landing on the runway he accidentally landed on one of the tarmacs used for planes to taxi to take off — while a passenger plane was getting ready to take off.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued this statement to Variety:\n“Air traffic controllers cleared the pilot of a single-engine Aviat Husky to land on Runway 20L at John Wayne Airport Monday afternoon. The pilot correctly read back the clearance. The pilot then landed on a taxiway that runs parallel to the runway, overflying a Boeing 737 that was holding short of the runway. The FAA is investigating this incident.” For those not up on flying lingo: Basically, Harrison set a course for landing over a plane, which could have had devastating consequences had the plane been in the process of taking off. As The FAA’s statement reads, they’re investigating this incident since it is a safety violation to land on a taxiway. While it’s clear this was simply an accident, according to NBC News , Harrison could still end up being hit with a warning statement, or more sever, a suspension of his pilot’s license.\nWe’re just happy to hear that Harrison is okay, and that all the passengers on the other flight are okay, too!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:43:25.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
