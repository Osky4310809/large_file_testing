The baby is the first for the couple, who have been married since 2012. \nThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants star shared the happy news on Instagram on Tuesday, along with a short video showing her daughter’s tiny foot peeking out from underneath a cozy pink blanket. \nAmber, 33, also made a baby name announcement, and it’s a doozy: “David and I are proud to announce the birth of our daughter, Dauphinoise Petunia Brittany Scheherazade Von Funkinstein Mustard Witch RBG Cross Tamblyn-Bey jr . #TheFutureIsFemale,” she captioned the clip. \nConfession: I got all the way to “Von Funkinstein” before I realized that she was probably joking – which just goes to show how outlandish some real celebrity baby names actually are. \nI mean, in a town that’s home to kids named Rocket Zot (Sam Worthington), Speck Wildhorse (John Cougar Mellencamp) and Zuma Nesta Rock (Gwen Stefani & Gavin Rossdale), Dauphinoise Petunia Brittany Scheherazade Von Funkinstein Mustard Witch RBG Cross Tamblyn-Bey jr just doesn’t seem all that odd. \nJoking about names aside, it’s clear that Amber and David, 52, have been thinking very seriously about what it means to be a parent and how they want to raise their child. \nIn a thought-provoking essay penned for Glamour magazine in October, Amber wrote, “I’ve been thinking about motherhood a lot lately. What it means to be one, what it means to have one, what it means to know one, what it means to make decisions as one and have conversations as one. I am very lucky to be surrounded by strong mothers, from my own mom to some of my best friends — those who are raising young women to accept themselves and those who are raising young men to accept women.” \nClick here to read Amber’s full essay on what it means to her to be a mother, and a woman. \nAnd congratulations to the new parents on baby “Dauphinoise!” \nPhotos: Brian To/Variety/REX/Shutterstock", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:05:46.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
