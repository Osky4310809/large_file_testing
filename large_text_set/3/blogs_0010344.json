Trump became our President, Shia Labeouf launched his “He Will Not Divide Us” project. The “performance art” project lasted only two days before there was controversy. The quick-tempered Labeouf got in the face and screamed at a white nationalist who appeared in front of his livestream event that he promised would last the entire four-year term of President Trump. It only took Shia six days into his project to get arrested for assault . And only 20 days into his 4-year undertaking, the “He Will Not Divide Us” was canceled due to concerns that it was sparking violence . Labeouf moved the project from the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Less than a week after the livestream started it was taken down “ after shots were reported in the area .” Determined to continue his performance art, Shia set up a third live broadcast. This time it took place in a secret area, to stop trolls from sabotaging the project. However, by utilizing stars and planes the trolls have shut down yet another HWNDU effort.\nLabeouf and two other artists flew a flag that said “He Will Not Divide Us” in an undisclosed area. The livestream showed only the flag waving in the wind and did not provide any landmarks on the ground to identify its whereabouts. \nhttps://t.co/n5A6SPuRlU \nNOW LIVE\nUnknown Location pic.twitter.com/ahhvHhzC6m \n— HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDU_livetweet) March 8, 2017 \n\nHowever, Shia underestimated the intelligence, determination, and free time of pro-Trump users of 4chan. They immediately began playing a real life game of capture the flag and were ready to use any spinkles of information to take it down.\nFrom Heat Street :\nThe search began on March 8 and was immediately narrowed when Labeouf was spotted on social media at a diner in Greenville, Tennessee, although some in the thread still believed the flag was in the Great Lakes area due to wind patterns. The time of the sunset in Greenville matched with the time of sunset on the stream, and so did the weather on local weather reports.\n4channers began looking into flight patterns. One of the few clues available on the stream were the contrails left by airplanes. Greenville was finally confirmed as the location after two planes observed on online flight radars intersected over the town and were seen on the stream.\nFinally when three planes flew over the area, 4channers were able to triangulate an approximate location of the flag.\nVia Heat Street \n\n\nHowever, the area was still too large to pinpoint the exact location of the HWNDU flag. So the 4chan trolls looked up to the heavens for answers. They utilized astronomy to get a more accurate location. And oh my stars it actually worked.\nVia Heat Street \n\nThey even went so far as to have a person drive around in a truck and honk the horn to see if they could hear it on the livestream. These clever fuckers thought of everything.\nWith their scientific approach, they were able to locate the flag, which was on private property.\nVia Heat \n\nThe 4chan trolls stole the “He Will Not Divide Us” flag and replaced it with a “Make America Great Again” hat and a t-shirt.\nVia Get Riced \n\n\nThe livestream broadcast the flagless pole all morning until the feed was cut off. \nThe “He Will Not Divide Us” flag is now in the hands of one of the 4chan trolls. \nVia Heat Street \n\nvia GIPHY \n[ HeatStreet ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T05:20:07.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
