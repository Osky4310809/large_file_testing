According to an FBI statement, Milwaukee police responded to reports of a shooting at a residence in the 3500 block of North 26th Street. They found the men, ages 38 and 39, suffering from gunshot wounds. They were eventually pronounced dead at the scene. \nAccording to the FBI, Strickland was charged with first degree intentional homicide and a state warrant was issued on July 28, 2016 for his arrest. He was also charged on Oct. 7, 2016 with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution and a federal arrest warrant was issued. \nFBI officials joined the search after the October charge. At one point, they believed Strickland was hiding in Chicago, where he has a number of friends and relatives. The FBI said they believe Strickland might have been heading to Mexico when he was captured. \nSpecial Agent Douglas Lindquist said 18 law enforcement and personnel from the FBI and the El Paso Police Department were involved in arresting Strickland, with the help of a public tip. \n“We’ll see if he wants to talk to us or not, and we’ll move on from there. But that’s a possibility, certainly something we’re looking at.” \nThe FBI added Strickland to its most-wanted list last month and called him “armed and extremely dangerous.” They offered a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to his arrest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:03:10.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
