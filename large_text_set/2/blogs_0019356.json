OK, maybe that’s an exaggeration, but it definitely has the worst traffic in the world according to one study. \nThe 2016 INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard ranks Los Angeles as number-one when it comes to traffic. INRIX says its traffic study is the largest ever, looking at congestion in 1,064 cities in 38 different countries. L.A. handily claims the top spot with 104 Peak Hours Spent in Congestion. That number (representing hours per year) is derived by applying the average peak-period traffic rate to the average commute time for each city. L.A. also tops the list with the highest INRIX Congestion Index, a metric that looks at congestion rates relative to a city’s size. \nComing in second is Moscow, Russia, followed by New York City and San Francisco. Bogotá, Colombia, rounds out the top five. The next worst U.S. city in the top 25 is Atlanta, Ga., at number eight, followed by Miami, Fla., and Washington, D.C., at numbers 10 and 13, respectively. \nThere are more than 15 million people living in Los Angeles, and more than 84 percent of people who live in the L.A., Long Beach, or Anaheim metro areas choose to drive to work, according to INRIX. Natrually, that many cars on the road leads to some major gridlock. The city’s worst spot is on I-10 eastbound between I-405 and I-110 in the evening. Curiously, the notorious 405 itself doesn’t make the top five most clogged arteries . \nCheck out the top 25 cities with the world’s worst traffic in the chart below and see a more detailed breakdown here .
