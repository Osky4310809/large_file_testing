She’s been extremely open about her journey, and yesterday Doherty shared a video of dancing after radiation treatment — even when she was clearly extremely tired. And we just can’t get over how freaking strong this woman is.\nWe were already tremendously inspired when Doherty posted pictures of the day she shaved her head because her hair was falling out, or the many times she has given us very real and honest updates on the fears and anxieties going through her mind as she battles this disease.\nAnd her latest post is nothing short of amazing. Doherty works it out harder than most of do on an average day (you know, when we haven’t just gotten a dose of exhausting radiation treatment), and we are seriously cheering.\nRadiation is tiring. It builds up within you and sometimes one just struggles to keep their eyes open. You can see how tired I am here but I'm still moving!! Any movement is so good during treatment, not just for the body, but for your mind as well. #cancerslayer @jammalibu @themamarosa \nA video posted by ShannenDoherty (@theshando) on Jan 4, 2017 at 8:14am PST \nUm, WOAH!\nShe captioned the video with, “Radiation is tiring.

It’s inspiring us to tackle any and all challenges in our lives with positivity, determination, and a general kickass attitude.\nLove my girl @annemkortright #Repost @annemkortright with @repostapp ・・・ @theshando I know I have told you over and over how amazed I am by your daily courage and strength, but once again you inspire me to be a better person and to appreciate the little things in life that we take for granted. You are a warrior and I have no doubt that like every other challenge in your life, you will conquer this. Know that you are inspiring me and every woman out there by sharing your journey.
