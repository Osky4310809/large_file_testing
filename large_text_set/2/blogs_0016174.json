However, they impressed in their pre-season win against the Chiefs last week. \nWhile they may have just a handful of Blues appearances, two of them are proven performers with prop Pauliasi Manu and new captain Jimmy Tupou boasting 91 Super Rugby appearances between them. \nManu, who returns to the Blues after four years at the Chiefs, anchors a scrum with North Harbour prop Sione Mafileo and Northland captain Matt Moulds, who gets a start after an apprenticeship behind All Blacks Keven Mealamu and James Parsons. \nSteve Luatua, Blake Gibson and Akira Ioane form an explosive backrow combination. Rieko Ioane and Akira Ioane will start for the Blues against the Rebels on Thursday.

Melani Nanai has been named on the wing.
