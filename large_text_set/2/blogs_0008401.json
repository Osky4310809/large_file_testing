He was taken to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ride, where he was pronounced dead. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s office identified the victim as Alvin Stoll, who lived about half a mile away. \nStoll’s mother was too distraught to talk Friday morning. \nNeighbors in the normally quiet Jefferson Park neighborhood were stunned that a teenager with seemingly his whole life to live was gunned down. \nOne woman who asked to remain anonymous said her children have known Stoll for at least seven years. \n“It broke my heart. My daughter started crying, my son who’s 11 started crying, because they grew up with this boy,” she said. “My daughter played with him from probably 5th grade up until freshman year. They were all good friends. He was a … seemed to be a nice kid; always happy, always smiling.

Area North detectives were investigating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:59:12.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
