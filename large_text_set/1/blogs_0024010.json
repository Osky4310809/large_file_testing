This new role reflects his standing in the side and we are confident he can lead us forward in the 50-over competition. \n\"He was highly impressive when he stepped in to the role last season and has already started to build up experience of handling the responsibilities that come with being a captain. \n\"Even with possible England commitments, we are likely to see Keaton for the entirety of the tournament and we feel this is another important step forward in his career.\" \nJennings will also captain the North side in the inaugural North vs South series, which takes place in the UAE in March.
