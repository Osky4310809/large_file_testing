Chip Taylor Smith and Paul Strother from Koerner's Boston band also will appear. \nThe all-ages show will be held Sunday, April 9, at the Cedar Cultural Center. \nKoerner has played a wide range of traditional American songs during his 50-year career, both as a solo performer and with various partners. With Glover and Dave \"Snaker\" Ray, Koerner was part of a trio that recorded landmark albums during the folk revival of the 1960s. \n____ \nhttp://www.thecedar.org \nhttp://www.redhouserecords.com \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press .
