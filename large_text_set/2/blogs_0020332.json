The EMP Summer House will debut in late June with an indoor restaurant, a dining room under a tent with picnic tables, and an outdoor area. The catch — only people who have American Express cards can make a reservation or pay with credit card.\nAmerican Express members “will have exclusive access” to Guidara and Humm’s pop-up in what used to be Moby’s , at 341 Pantigo Rd. in East Hampton. The EMP Summer House “will be collaborating on a number of unique experiences,” according to a statement. The Times notes that large format meals like a lobster boil may be on deck. Non-Amex holding diners can still go, but only if they can nab a table by walking in and if they pay by cash. \nMeanwhile, Guidara and Humm tell Flo Fab that their three Michelin-star tasting menu restaurant in Manhattan will close on June 9th for the renovation in the kitchen and dining room. It hasn’t been revamped since the restaurant first opened under Danny Meyer 20 years ago. \nThey hired Brad Cloepfil, who designed the Museum of Arts and Design at Columbus Circle, to redo the space. Expect a more open entrance, “more symmetrical” seating, rugs, more color, and a bigger bar. \nBefore the restaurant closes, Humm will offer the current menu with an eleven-course tasting menu with biggest hits from the past. The meal, which costs $295, will include sea urchin cappuccino, foie gras with maple syrup, poached chicken with black truffles, and the crunch Milk and Honey dessert. It will launch in mid-April. \nAfter the restaurant reopens, EMP will return to the nine course tasting menus for which it’s known. \nEleven Madison Park Is Closing This Summer for a Major Renovation [ENY] Eleven Madison Park Plans a Makeover and a Summer Pop-Up [NYT] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:44:10.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
