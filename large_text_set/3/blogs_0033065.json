We never have any success there. The last time we had success there was Kevin Campbell and believe you me that was a long, long time ago. \n“I was actually there. That game, the memories are vague because it’s that long ago. I hate going to Anfield. It never goes our way there. \n“We never get a bit of luck that favours us. The only bit of luck we got there, in my experience over the last decade, was Phil Jagielka hitting that ball into the top corner a couple of seasons ago. That was about as good as it has got for me at Anfield.
