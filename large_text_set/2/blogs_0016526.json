So just simply trying a few things around. \n“Round one, he’ll still be a viable option for us.” \nA fit Watts’ non-selection for the Demons’ pre-season opener against Western Bulldogs has prompted speculation he may be overlooked by new coach Goodwin. \nBut Gawn backed Watts to continue his strong 2016 form this season and expected him to play in at least one of the remaining two pre-season matches. \n“He’s fit. He’s been training all pre-season,” Gawn said. \n“But for some reason or another he wasn’t picked in the 24 (against the Bulldogs). I’m sure that wasn’t based on because he wasn’t good enough to be in the 22. \n“I think that’s more based on some of the training things we’ve seen from other guys around him, like Sam Weideman and Aaron Vandenberg, who deserved a go. \n“The Jack Watts we saw last year will be the Jack Watts we see this year.” \n- AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:29:37.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
