To be honest, choosing a group name is really hard. ‘Seo Taiji and Boys’ was actually my least favorite name back in the day. Because I was one of the ‘Boys.'” \nHe added, “A singer’s name depends on the success of the singer. If the singer isn’t successful, the name doesn’t feel good either. I will judge the names of our groups after I see their performances.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:59:25.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
