If thatâ€™s the case, maybe I should have applied. \nDeVos has never attended a public school, has never been a teacher, lacks basic educational concepts and has no banking experience. \nNow, she is in charge of 4,400 employees and an annual budget of $68 billion. She also now manages a $1 trillion loan portfolio and is in charge of giving out grants that amass to over $30 billion in aid each year. \nAnd she still canâ€™t find the pencils. Day 1 on the job is done, but we're only getting started. Now where do I find the pencils? ðŸ™‚ pic.twitter.com/0vRKF1opE9 \nâ€” Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) February 9, 2017 \nI was raised by a teacherâ€™s aid, my brother has always wanted to be a teacher and proudly works in public education, and my aunt and cousins also chose this often thankless path. \nSo, let me help you out, Betsy. You have to bring the pencils in yourself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:51:51.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
