One of the best in the world.\" \nThe 69-year-old explains that they first formed a friendship in George's early Wham! days and recalls the time he dressed as Ronald McDonald at the last Wham! concert. George Michael and Elton John (Photo: Getty) \n\"It was an amazing friendship based on music to start with, and I remember sitting in the car just off of Hyde Park listening to a cassette of 'Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' and I said, ‘George, that’s the nearest record I’ve heard to a Motown record for years and years.’ \n\"It was such a great record, and he and I became great friends. I just want to remember him for his wonderful music and his kindness, which people are commenting on.\" \nContinuing to praise George's personality, he added: \"He was the kindest, most generous man, and did it without wanting any publicity. I’ve seen him being so kind to so many people. I’ll miss him so much for his music but more than anything for his humanity.
