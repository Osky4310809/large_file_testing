She has come out and has posted a hard hitting note. She took to Instagram and posted an image with the caption that read, ‚ÄúReally felt a need to share this! thanks to my fan clubs friends and family for always giving me the strength i hope we all can find this strength from within each other and stop suffering #spreadlove‚Äù The image had the caption, ‚ÄúHave been reading so many news lately on molestation and rape! When people in our country are worshiping goddesses what a shame for not being respectful enough to know certain boundaries that make you a human and not an animal! It‚Äôs easier to judge a woman on the basis of how much they cover up their skin, but it‚Äôs hard to accept your own cheap mentality where you can‚Äôt stop staring at those inappropriate areas which you are asking her to cover! Wake up and start accepting that we are not going to be anybody‚Äôs idea of an ‚ÄúIndian girl‚Äù. Don‚Äôt let your frustration destroy somebody‚Äôs life because you won‚Äôt be happy if it happens in your own family! Stop this hypocrisy and open your mind!‚Äù \nCheck out the post below: A post shared by disha patani (paatni) (@dishapatani) on Feb 21, 2017 at 2:59am PST \nWell that‚Äôs a one smart move by the actress. That‚Äôs how one should deal with trolls and haters on social media. It‚Äôs funny to see when in a country like ours celebs like Disha Patani can‚Äôt escape the slut shaming, just imagine the plight of a common woman and what they go through in their day to day lives. Trying to avoid and escape the lecherous eyes of those who called themselves ‚Äòhumans‚Äô. \nFor the uninitiated, after the telecast of Filmfare awards, an image of a guy sitting next to her went viral and was said that he was ogling at her cleavage. In fact she also faced the ire of trolls when she posted her image on insta wearing the same dress. Also read: SHOCKING!
