Trump et al ), joins an ever-growing list of cases filed in various federal courts around the country that challenge the legality of the executive order.\nHowever, the ACLU proposed class action lawsuit, which was filed on Thursday on behalf of a number of California students affected by the order, makes creative use of President Donald Trump’s tweets against him—pointing out specific instances where the president has described the action as a \" ban \" on Muslims.\nOr, as Elizabeth Joh , a University of California, Davis law professor, put it:\nCan you sue the President based on his tweets? We're about to find out. @ACLU_NorCal sues on #MuslimBan EO: https://t.co/Yku4uIAl1o\n— Elizabeth Joh (@elizabeth_joh) February 3, 2017\nVarious plaintiffs, including that ACLU, argue that a de facto Muslim ban is unconstitutional—the First Amendment specifically prohibits \"establishment of religion,\" including the government favoring one religion over another.\nAs Ars has reported before, the executive order , which was signed last week, restricts entry or re-entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. The order affects immigrants from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Syria.\nOn Friday afternoon, a federal judge in Seattle ruled against the White House , imposing a temporary restraining order nationwide, effectively immediately. A federal judge in Los Angeles granted a similar restraining order earlier in the week. So far, the government has lost all of its attempts to block such a restraining order. However, also on Friday, in yet another related case, a federal judge in Massachusetts declined to renew a temporary restraining order, which is set to expire on Sunday.\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft formally asked the US Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to grant it and other companies an exemption for it's affected employees, noting that \"there is no evidence that they pose a security or safety threat to the United States.\"\n\"Preventing Muslim Immigration\" Further Reading Tech sector begins legal assault on Trump immigration order [Updated] Amongst the three tweets cited, the civil complaint specifically mentions this one that dates back to nearly a year before the election of November 2016:\nStatement on Preventing Muslim Immigration: https://t.co/HCWU16z6SR pic.twitter.com/d1dhaIs0S7\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015\nOne lawyer, Eunice Lee , the co-legal director at the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California, Hastings, told Ars that Trump’s tweets and other public statements by members of his staff are quite clear.\n\"They’re definitely making statements that the executive order is animated by animus towards Muslims,\" she said.\nAccording to David Sklansky , a law professor at Stanford University, it’s traditionally very difficult for plaintiffs to show specific animus against a particular protected group—so Trump's Twitter account is fair game.\n\"It's quite extraordinary to have the president of the United States staying publicly, repeatedly, that what we are going to try to do is to single out a constitutionally-protected group,\" he told Ars. \"It's quite strong evidence and it would be remarkable if the plaintiffs didn't rely on it.\"\nSimilarly, Justin Cox , an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center , who is representing plaintiffs in a similar ongoing case in New York ( Darweesh v. Trump ), told Ars that often-times such lawsuits are usually based on public statements made by more local public officials—like city council members or state legislators.\n\"Because those are the folks that are usually saying those sorts of things that are on the public record,\" he said. \"The president doesn’t typically say racist things out loud where everyone can see it.\"\nCox referred Ars to a 1985 Supreme Court decision, Hunter v. Underwood , which turned on an interpretation of a section of the 1901 Alabama Constitution. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court found that a portion of the state’s constitution disenfranchised African-Americans, and was therefore, unconstitutional under the United States Constitution. But, as Cox noted, it’s not always so clear-cut, and cases like this don't come up very often.\n\"Politicians aren’t dumb enough to capture things in explicitly racist terms,\" he added. \"The case law on these types of claims—you’re talking about other types of evidence, deviations from normal procedures. Politicians don’t say stupid shit like this out loud, so [Trump’s] bucking that trend.\"", "external_links": ["https://law.stanford.edu/directory/david-alan-sklansky/", "https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=44", "https://t.co/d1dhaIs0S7", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3444409-20170202-Complaint.html", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3445817-Boston-TRO-Expires.html", "https://law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/joh/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_v._Underwood", "https://twitter.com/elizabeth_joh/status/827605392293105665", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states", "https://cgrs.uchastings.edu//about/bio/eunice-lee", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/673993417429524480", "https://www.nilc.org/", "https://twitter.com/jb_cox", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/826774668245946368", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ArsTrumpGettyImages-632238364-360x200.jpg", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GettyImages-629704360-360x200.jpg", "https://t.co/Yku4uIAl1o", "https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/02/02/need-exception-process-last-weeks-executive-order/#sm.00000vgif9u2vxfa7udhoaxjzd9fv", "https://t.co/HCWU16z6SR", "https://twitter.com/ACLU_NorCal", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuslimBan?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-04T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:49:16.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
