Over its 30 years (and counting) in the market, the Air Max 1 has prompted some truly clever partnerships with stores and artists from around the world. Honoring some of the most important collaborations in the Air Max 1’s history, Nike is releasing the Air Max 1 “Master”.\nInspired by the Nike mini-documentary Masters of Air, Vol. 1 , the “Master” fuses a variety of collaborations that have excited Nike’s worldwide Air Max fanbase over the years; with so many different colorways incorporated on a single shoe, fans of Nike’s notable “What The” series should also feel right at home with this homage.\nWhile there are several pivotal styles in the mix, notable cameos on the “Master” include hits from past Air Max collaborations with Kid Robot, Amsterdam’s Patta and Parra, Tokyo’s atmos, Hong Kong’s CLOT, and others. Naturally, the silhouette also pays tribute to the Air Max 1 that started it all, incorporating the OG’s University Red on the toe. Check out the video below for the full credits.\nReleasing during Nike’s month of Air Max festivities—culminating with Air Max Day on March 26—this tribute to three decades of fans, retailers and collaborators is a must cop for casual fans and collectors alike.
