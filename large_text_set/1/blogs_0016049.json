The paper has been published today in Scientific Reports . \nLeonie produced 47 eggs during the 2014-2015 period, from which six embryos resulted, but no pups hatched. During the 2015-2016 period, she produced 41 eggs, from which four embryos resulted, and three living pups hatched between February and April of 2016. \n\"We thought she could be storing sperm but when we tested the pups and the possible parent sharks using DNA fingerprinting, we found they only had cells from Leonie,\" said study leader Christine Dudgeon of the University of Queensland's School of Biomedical Sciences. However, the pups are not clones of their mother. They only have half her genetic diversity . \nFor the leopard shark, which is listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, this could be a breakthrough. \n\"This has big implications for conservation and shows us how flexible the shark's reproductive system really is. Leonie adapted to her circumstances and we believe she switched because she lost her mate. What we want to know now is could this occur in the wild and, if so, how often does it? One reason why we haven't seen it before could be because we haven't been looking for it.\" \nThese pups are still living, and are being monitored by the aquarium to determine if sharks produced asexually can also reproduce. \n\"You lose genetic diversity with generations of asexual reproduction, so we'll be seeing if these offspring can mate sexually themselves,\" Dudgeon said. \nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech stuff is cool.
