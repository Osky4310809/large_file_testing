We followed necessary protocol by inviting him through NNPC but he is yet to report for interrogation after many months of acknowledging our invitation. \n“We may be forced to watch-list the former GMD which can lead to his extradition from any part of the world. \n“This former GMD ought to interact with our detectives on some of the clues already at the disposal of EFCC. \n“But the ex-GMD has been relying on one excuse or the other to meet with our team of investigators.” \nResponding to a question, the top source said: “We have been able to trace the country where the ex-GMD is at present. We only need to locate where exactly he is staying. The good thing is that we have a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with his host country which can hasten his arrest and repatriation. \n“The EFCC does not say the former GMD is guilty of any infractions yet. But we want him to return home to respond to some issues on Diezani.” \nThe EFCC has detained a former Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Andrew Yakubu’s over alleged slush funds of $9,772,800 and £74,000. \nYakubu, who is in EFCC’s custody in Kano, confirmed that the cash was accumulated gift from unnamed persons. \nThe anti-graft agency revealed that Yakubu hid the cash in a fire proof safe at his brother’s house in the slums of Sabon Tasha area of Kaduna metropolis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:38:58.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
