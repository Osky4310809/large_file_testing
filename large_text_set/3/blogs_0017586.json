Watch in Times Video » embed The summer after I moved back to Brooklyn from Manhattan, I created a weekly ice cream ritual. I’d run two and a half miles to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory , order a chocolate malted and devour it on the sweaty walk home. Surely the five-mile round trip would mitigate some of the damage done, I’d tell myself. I always asked for a double portion of malted milk powder blended into the drink. It made it sweeter and more intensely malty, and so thick I could barely suck it through the straw. Imagine chocolate soft serve, but frothier, with a more complex taste.

It’s got the same chocolaty, creamy and malty flavors, churned into a satiny ice cream that’s veined with fudge sauce to create gooey, bittersweet ripples. Just like in the soda fountain drink, the main source of malt flavor for the ice cream is malted milk powder. But because malted milk powder is made with heaps of sugar, there’s only so much one can add before the mixture turns cloying. Follow NYT Food's board The Best of Melissa Clark on Pinterest. So to increase the malt factor without ending up with something that hurts your teeth, I augmented the malt powder with barley malt syrup . A sticky, dark amber liquid that’s heady and thick but not too sweet, you can find it in health food stores and online. And it’s well worth seeking out for its toasted, caramelized character. (If you can’t find it, you can just leave it out; the ice cream will still be malty, though not quite as deeply so.) \nAdvertisement   I also add the malt syrup to the fudge sauce, where it does double duty. The syrup adds great flavor, and its viscosity helps keep the fudge sauce supple in the ice cream, so you end up with soft ripples and not rock-solid seams. Photo Credit Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times Make sure to use a light touch when folding the fudge sauce into the just-churned ice cream. Go for distinct marbling, not a thorough mixing. Otherwise you’ll lose the pleasure of your spoon hitting those discrete, dark pockets of fudge. Or skip the ripple and serve the ice cream with the fudge sauce on top. Of course, you can also use the ice cream as a base of a fantastic chocolate malted. Just put it in the blender with a little milk and let it all whirl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:33:01.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
