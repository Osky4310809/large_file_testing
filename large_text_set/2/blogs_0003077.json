Rory was primarily responsible for that, and Chris Vernon of The Ringer had no doubt that he would be recognized for his dominance: Chris Vernon @ChrisVernonShow 2/5/2017, 8:22:04 PM Although he didn't get himself in the MVP conversation, Alexander Hamilpup was a major contributor to Team Fluff's success as well. On top of that, he likely picked up plenty of fans with his antics, as Animal Planet shared: Despite being their namesake, the Puppy Bowl wasn't entirely about dogs. There were chinchilla and owl mascots, bunny and guinea pig cheerleaders, and even a bird named Meep handling social media. In addition, there was an entertaining kitten halftime show capped by a stirring performance from the Chicago Rock Cats: Team Fluff had a big lead to start the second half and continued to build upon it for the remainder of the game. By the time the action reached its conclusion, Team Fluff had left no doubt that it deserved to win the 13th edition of the Puppy Bowl. As actor Wil Wheaton pointed out, however, the cuteness displayed by all of the puppies involved meant there were plenty more winners: Wil Wheaton @wilw The official winner of #PuppyBowl is all of us who watched it and smiled for two straight hours, with occasional squees. 2/5/2017, 9:57:49 PM All of the dogs involved in the Puppy Bowl are rescues, and it was revealed at the conclusion of the broadcast that many of them have already been adopted. While the Puppy Bowl is great in terms of watching adorable animals run around and play, it helps spread a more important message. The puppies captured plenty of hearts Sunday, and with Animal Planet stressing the importance of adoption, those who have yet to find a forever home may not have to wait much longer.
