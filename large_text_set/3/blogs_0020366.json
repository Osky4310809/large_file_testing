I’m still trying to figure out where I fit in.” \nOf course, that’s just at the race track. \nIn the rest of his life, Stewart is crazy busy, as he always is, on a variety of fronts. His holdings include half of SHR, one of NASCAR’s elite teams; a sprint car team; several race tracks, most famously Eldora Speedway; and even a sanctioning body, the Arctic Cat All-Star Circuit of Champions Sprint Car Series. \nLast week, Stewart flew across the country, including to Liberty University in Virginia, where he and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger were keynote speakers at the Ignite Men’s Impact Weekend. \nStewart has always been a huge multi-tasker, so his insane schedule should surprise no one. \nBut at the NASCAR races, things are different now that he isn’t driving. \nStewart said that on Saturdays, he tries to help out SHR rookie XFINITY Series driver Cole Custer and his crew chief Jeff Meendering. \n“It’s just little stuff I’m trying to help him with get acclimated and get him comfortable,” Stewart said of Custer. “And I think he’s doing a really good job so far.” \nSundays, Stewart sits atop the pit box of the No. 14 SHR entry, the car he drove until retiring at the end of last year. \nThere, Stewart will talk with Mike Bugarewicz, crew chief for Clint Bowyer, the driver who replaced Stewart in the No. 14. \n“Sunday, the guys have pretty much got a handle on it,” Stewart said. “I just kind of sit there. And if I think of something, I’ll tell Buga and he’ll tell Clint, or I’ll plant a seed in his head about something to think about.” \nStewart admitted that observing can be more taxing than being behind the wheel. \n“I’m enjoying watching our four cars run,” Stewart said. \nAnd then he added, “I’m not a very good spectator. I’m learning.” \nAnd although he may still be getting used to his new role, Stewart said it’s an important one. \n“I enjoy being here and being supportive of our guys,” Stewart said. “If that’s all they really want out of me, I’m happy to do that for them, because I’m proud of our guys. I’m proud of the work they do, proud of what they’ve done over the winter. And I want these guys to know I care.” \nAnd that hasn’t changed one bit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:11:01.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
