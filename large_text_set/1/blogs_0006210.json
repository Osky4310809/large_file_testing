The blessings continued through Jacob's father, Isaac , then to Jacob and his descendants. Jacob's sons became leaders of the 12 tribes of Israel . \nThe younger of twins, Jacob was born holding on to his brother Esau 's heel. His name means \"he grasps the heel\" or \"he deceives.\" Jacob lived up to his name. He and his mother Rebekah cheated Esau out of his birthright and blessing. Later in Jacob's life, God renamed him Israel, which means \"he struggles with God.\" \nIn fact, Jacob struggled with God his entire life, as many of us do. As he matured in faith , Jacob depended on God more and more. But the turning point for Jacob came after a dramatic, all-night wrestling match with God. In the end, the Lord touched Jacob's hip and he was a broken man, but also a new man. From that day forward, Jacob was called Israel. And for the rest of his life he walked with a limp, demonstrating his dependence on the Lord. Jacob finally learned to give up control to God. \nJacob's story teaches us how an imperfect person can be greatly blessed by God--not because of who he or she is, but because of who God is. Accomplishments of Jacob in the Bible \nJacob in the Bible account fathered 12 sons, who became leaders of the 12 tribes of Israel. One of them was Joseph, a key figure in the Old Testament. \nHis name is frequently associated with God in the Bible: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. \nJacob persevered in his love for Rachel. He proved to be a hard worker. Jacob's Strengths \nJacob was clever. Sometimes this trait worked for him, and sometimes it backfired on him. \nHe used both his mind and strength to build his wealth and family. Jacob's Weaknesses \nSometimes Jacob made his own rules, deceiving others for selfish gain. He did not trust God to work things out. \nEven though God revealed himself to Jacob in the Bible, Jacob took a long time to become a true servant of the Lord. \nHe favored Joseph over his other sons, leading to jealousy and strife within his family. Life Lessons \nThe sooner we trust God in life, the longer we will benefit from his blessings. When we fight God, we are in a losing battle. \nWe often worry about missing the will of God for our life, but God works with our mistakes and bad decisions. His plans cannot be upset. Hometown \nCanaan. References to Jacob in the Bible \nJacob's story is found in Genesis chapters 25-37, 42, 45-49. His name is mentioned throughout the Bible in connection with God: \"the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\" Occupation \nShepherd, prosperous owner of sheep and cattle.
