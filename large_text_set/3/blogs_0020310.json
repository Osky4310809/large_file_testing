(Mayo is 21, and Bighorse is 16; they were 14 and nine, respectively, when they started the band.) But they still got Veruca Salt co-leaders Louise Post and Nina Gordon to help write the songs from their forthcoming EP New Trick . And a song like “Hail Mary” has some of the grand, large-scale fuzzy melodicism that’s largely gone extinct from the ’90s. It’s a very cool song, and it has a very cool and arty video from director Dave Smith. Check it out below, via NPR . \nThe New Trick EP is out 4/28 on El Camino Media .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:15:03.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
