It‚Äôs everything that makes soccer fun. \nBut then we got a look at this rabona goal from Rodrigo Branco in Wales on Saturday. Branco‚Äôs Bangor City were desperately trying to catch up to Bala Town, when he got a clear chance at goal and did this: Rodrigo Branco rabona goal for Bangor v Bala Town üî•üî•üî• https://t.co/sxYKXbOWWf \n‚Äî 101 Great Goals (@101greatgoals) February 4, 2017 \nCan a rabona get any more unnecessary than that? \nHe had the goalkeeper beat and all he had to do was tap the ball into the net. He could‚Äôve used either foot, the inside or the outside of his foot, or a toe poke ‚Äì it didn‚Äôt matter because anything would‚Äôve done the job. But he went for the higher degree of difficulty with the rabona and knocked it in. \nIt didn‚Äôt need to be done at all, but we still appreciate it anyway. In fact, maybe that‚Äôs why we appreciate it the most. After all, rabona goals will still always be better than non-rabona goals. \nBangor City still lost, 2-3, but Branco gets an ‚ÄúA‚Äù for effort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:26:42.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
