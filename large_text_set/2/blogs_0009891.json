This large Midwestern state, with a population of 13m, had the most underfunded retirement system of any state and the largest pension burden relative to state revenue. Its bond rating was the lowest in the union, which meant it had sky-high borrowing costs. Pundits compared the state’s finances to those of Greece—or Botswana: Moody’s gave Illinois and Botswana the same credit worthiness rating. Two years on, Illinois is an even bigger mess. It seemed hardly possible for the state’s finances to have deteriorated further still, but they did. Illinois has not had a budget in two years thanks mainly to Mr Rauner’s inability to agree on a compromise with the legislature controlled by Democrats. On February 10th the Civic Federation, a watchdog, published a new report that said Illinois needs a new budget immediately and admonished Mr Rauner and lawmakers for their intransigence in the budget standoff. \"Illinois is in the unenviable position of having by far the worst-rated credit in the United States and the most notoriously dysfunctional state government,\" said Laurence Msall, boss of the Civic Federation. Two days earlier, on February 8th, Chris Kennedy, a Democrat and successful businessman, declared his intention to run for governor of Illinois next year. He accused Mr Rauner of destroying the state’s economy and blamed him for turning a disagreement on the state’s budget into economic chaos for the state. “I don't think it needed to go that way. And I think it's fixable,\" said Mr Kennedy, who is one of the many children of Bobby Kennedy, an icon of liberal Democrats and former attorney-general, and a nephew of John F. Kennedy. Mr Kennedy has toyed with the idea of running for public office several times in the past. He came to Illinois in 1986 when he moved to Decatur for a job at Archer Daniels Midland, a food maker and commodities trader. He is best known in Chicago as head of Merchandise Mart Properties, a developer and manager of real estate headquartered in an imposing downtown building that was once the largest building in the world, and chairman of the University of Illinois’s board of trustees. After stepping down at Merchandise Mart, he and his wife founded Top Box Foods, a non-profit organisation that provides nutritious food to poor families. Mr Kennedy’s career history is not dissimilar to Mr Rauner's. Both are former entrepreneurs; both are wealthy. Neither were in politics until they decided to run for the governorship. Mr Kennedy may face J.B. Pritzker, another rich businessman whose family owns the chain of Hyatt hotels, in the Democratic primaries. The only Democratic candidate who has officially declared his intention to run is Ameya Pawar, an alderman from the North side of Chicago. In an interview with Greg Hinz of Crain’s Chicago Business , a weekly, Mr Kennedy focused on Mr Rauner rather than his potential Democratic rivals. He said that he had recently talked to “the head of the largest sovereign wealth fund” about investing in Illinois and was rejected because Illinois is the only state in the country without a budget. He complained that Illinois is losing jobs and people. None of the investors he is in touch with, said Mr Kennedy, talk about tort reform or the high cost of workers’ compensation, two crucial elements of Mr Rauner’s turnaround agenda on which he refuses to compromise with Democratic lawmakers. Mr Rauner’s other pet reforms are a freeze of property taxes, the imposition of legislative term limits and a weakening of collective bargaining rights for union members. Mr Rauner will unveil his proposal for the next budget on February 15th. In 2015 he asked lawmakers to balance a budget proposal with a gap between expenditure and revenue of a whopping $6bn. The result: no budget. A year later he pushed for $4bn in cuts. Again no budget was passed. This year is unlikely to be any better. It is perhaps little wonder that people in the state are already taking a keen interest in Mr Kennedy, or any other candidate brave enough to take on the governorship of Illinois in January 2019.
