PUBLISHED: 14:37,  24, Wed, Mar 29, 2017 YouTube Swedish MEP Peter Lundgren has been a vocal supporter of Brexit \nEurosceptic Peter Lundgren told express.co.uk he predicts the UK will have a “prospering future” after quitting the bloc and said his homeland could soon follow suit. \nThe euro MP, from the right-wing Sweden Democrats party, said Britain was “leading the way” with its historic decision to leave the project and claimed many ordinary Europeans support Brexit.

REUTERS Donald Tusk said the rest of Europe was 'already missing' Britain TWITTER Sir Tim Barrow formally handed in the Article 50 notification today \nHe said: “I call this the second D-Day, and once again Britons have shown the lead. They have been there before for Europe, now they’re there again showing that it’s possible to do what no-one thought was possible. \n“It feels like today I can finally taste a breath of freedom air here in Brussels. I can see the faces over in the Commission and it’s not really happy faces, but in here among the common people it’s very happy faces.” \nThe Swedish MEP accused the EU of being out of touch with ordinary voters, and said the tumbling turnout for European Parliament elections - down to just 42 per cent in 2014 - showed “major mistrust” of the project. \nHe said: “Their only solution as ever is more EU, more legislation, more trade agreements. The people don’t want that and they show it in the lack of interest in the election result. \n“This [Brexit] is the result of the EU being unable to listen to the ordinary people.” I think the result of these negotiations will be a template for the rest of the countries who want to leave. Swedish MEP Peter Lundgren \nAnd he said the bloc was now facing “navigating a minefield” during the Brexit negotiations, having to balance the necessity for trade with Britain against encouraging other members to go it alone. \nHe said: “There will be some common sense into this because Britain is too big of a market to give them a bad deal and I cannot see the EU doing that. \n“But at the same time they cannot give too good of a deal because then that’s no value for the remaining 27 countries to stay within the EU so it’s like navigating in a minefield for the EU. \n“I think the result of these negotiations will be a template for the rest of the countries who want to leave. \n“It’s always the first case it’s difficult, then you have the procedure of how to do it and then I believe we will also see in the future more countries within the EU that want to leave because their big problem is they are not in contact with their own common people.” Brexit day LIVE: images from around the country as Britain invokes Article 50 Wed, March 29, 2017 The country reacts as Theresa May officially invokes Article 50, and begins the process of Britain leaving the European Union PA 1 of 22 Prime Minister Theresa May announces in the House of Commons that she has triggered Article 50, starting a two-year countdown to the UK leaving the EU \nThe Swedish euro MP said that he agreed with Mr Tusk that the EU would “miss” the British influence, but said the country was now on course for a “new method of cooperation with Europe”. \nHe said: “I will miss the British people very much here in the EU, but they are now setting out a course for the rest of us to be able to follow. \n“I don’t see it as we’re waving goodbye to Britain because you will still be there and it will still be possible to go to Britain and visit your friends, and it will still be possible to make trade with Britain. \n“So I don’t see it as they’re leaving Europe, they’re simply getting into a new method of having cooperation with Europe. For me it’s not a sad day, I’m very happy today that they achieved what they’re fought for for such a long time.” \nThe Sweden Democrats, part of the same European grouping as Ukip, are currently the third largest party in the country’s parliament, having secure 12.9 per cent of the vote and 49 out of its 349 seats in 2014. \nBut the latest poll, released by YouGov last week, predicted the party will become the largest in Sweden in next year’s General Election, securing 24 per cent of the vote and 83 seats.
