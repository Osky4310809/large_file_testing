James Tamou after winning Most Improved Player at the 2010 Cowboys awards night. Source: News Corp Australia \n“It was Mum and Dad and my manager Sam Ayoub (that kept me up there) saying, ‘mate, just roll with the punches, stuff like that’, ‘keep my mind on the job’.” \nSimple words of advice but clearly they had an impact, with Tamou pulling on a Cowboys jumper for his NRL debut in round eight, 2009. \nComing up to 200 games later and Tamou was brought to Penrith for his character and ability to mentor a talented young pack as much as for his obvious footballing talent. \nBut he still thinks back at his days spent partying as a younger man and shakes his head at the gamble he was taking with his career, especially given all the sacrifices his parents had made for him. \n“My start up there, pre-season, I took it for granted I think, the drinking, the partying,” Tamou said. \n“I look back at it now and think there’s kids who’d give their left arm to get that opportunity. So I look back and sort of shake my head at myself.” \nBen Ikin, Nathan Ryan and Ben Glover are joined by Dragons recruitment boss Ian Millward to discuss the club’s recruitment plan and why it revolves around Ben Hunt. \nYou can also subscribe via iTunes or for Android users, listen on the iPP Podcast Player app. \nTamou’s empathy for kids who grow up with nothing but a dream comes from his humble beginnings, with his parents moving away from their home in New Zealand when he was still a young kid to give he and his brothers an opportunity for a better life. \n“Growing up living in New Zealand, we didn’t have much,” Tamou said. \n“We always get together you know, for Christmas with the brothers, we always talk about how we’d go to school in bare feet and you know, we look back at those times and sort of cherish those memories. \n“Obviously they were hard back then but they were good times. \n“Dad was definitely a hero of mine and I loved hearing his old war stories about the footy games and stuff. \n“My dad’s a very hard worker and when we first come over to Australia he was coming home from security in the early hours in the morning and getting up to go to work at like 5 or 6 o’clock. \n“So he was doing some tough times and we hardly got to see him.” James Tamou makes a hit up in one of his early games for the Cowboys. Source: News Limited \nHis dad’s incredible work ethic paved the way for Tamou to get his start on the pathway to the NRL, getting picked for the Roosters’ SG Ball side out of Matraville Sports High School. \n“I remember coming home with all the training gear and that,” Tamou recalls. \n“I was putting them on and Mum and Dad were taking photos and stuff like that, they were just so proud.” \nWhile he was always considered a top talent, Tamou was unable to secure a first grade opportunity with the Roosters, which eventually took him to Townsville, where his NRL career got its start. \nHowever, his early days with the Tricoulours did give him the inspiration to work hard for his goal to play first grade, with Tamou revealing the awe-struck sensation seeing the likes of Braith Anasta and Willie Mason gave him. \n“Seeing the first graders walking in and walking out gave me a big buzz back in those days,” Tamou said. \n“I remember I’d be walking around Bondi Junction and seeing Willie Mason and Braith Anasta and stuff like that and we were just blown away. \n“We were too shy to go up to them but we were just blown away and I think that actually fuelled me wanting to play rugby league for my career even more. \n“I was just fortunate from there to get a rookie contract up in North Queensland. Eight years up there and it was the best time in my life.” \nLive stream the Cowboys’ round three clash with Manly on FOX SPORTS. Get your   and start watching in minutes. SIGN UP NOW !
