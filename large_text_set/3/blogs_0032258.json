Extra Dimension Skinfinish is finally back, and all three shades of the superglowy duo-chome highlighters will be permanently available starting next month. That news merits blasting \"Glow\" at full volume, if you ask us. We're most excited about the revival of Oh Darling. The best-selling hue gives cheekbones a golden touch that could probably been seen in a galaxy beyond the Milky Way. You'll also be able to shop Glow With It (a radiant peach) and Superb (a rose gold) one at a time. You no longer have to worry about stocking up on the previously limited-edition shades before they're gone. Each will be $33.

Everyone, the Extra Dimension Blush is finally happening. We peeped the blush-meets-highlighter backstage more times than we could count during fashion month. The pretty pinks and vibrant corals it comes in gave models's cheeks a drool-worthy luminous flush of color. A quick sweep of it on each apple instantly brightened their faces (and ours at the sight of it). There will be 11 Extra Dimension Blush shades to choose from for $28 each. Into the Pink (a soft pink) was one of the most-used hues for the fall 2017 fashion shows, so we're excited to try it out for ourselves. There's also Just a Pinch, if you've been feeling the peach vibes lately. And if you want something more natural, we're into Hard to Get (a warm brown with burgundy undertones). Loading The M.A.C. Extra Dimension Skinfinish and Blush will be available April 6 on maccosmetics.com .
