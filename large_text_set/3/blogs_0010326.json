What could Mr. Trump do about that? He could learn the lessons of the trend he has inherited. From 2015 to 2016, wage growth was more broadly shared than at any time since the end of the Great Recession, and in 2016, growth was actually more rapid for middle- and low-wage workers than for those at the top. There were especially significant increases in 15 states and the District of Columbia, where new minimum wages were passed. For low-wage working women in those states, wages grew 6.3 percent in 2016 compared with 2.5 percent in states without minimum wage increases. The median hourly wage increase, 3.1 percent in 2016, is harder to pin on any one cause. What is known is that middle-income wages would benefit by updating rules on overtime pay so more salaried workers were eligible. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has thus far shown no interest in higher minimum wages, overtime protections and other efforts to improve labor standards, even though the data is telling him these measures work. So could fulfilling some of his promises. Federal infrastructure spending could bolster employment, wages and growth, especially at a time like the present when there is still slack in the labor market.
