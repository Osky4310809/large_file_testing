Sunil has played many a popular characters on the show, and has been one of the regulars since Kapil's show first aired on Colors, in 2013. Allegedly, the altercation took place while the cast and crew of the show were on a flight back from Australia, where they had performed. Kapil, who was supposedly drunk, abused and beat Sunil, who did not respond, and had to be taken away by the flight crew. \nA day after the incident, Kapil posted on Facebook talking about the incident, calling it a \"family matter\" and questioning the reliability of the story, and negativity of the media. \nWe're not exactly sure what happened, and Kapil's down-playing of the matter doesn't help, either. Reportedly, Sunil Grover is in no mood to return to the show after the incident (and we don't blame him), but we guess we'll have to just see what happens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T08:09:36.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
