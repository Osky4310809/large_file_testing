News Servamp Manga Goes on Hiatus Due to Author's Health posted on 2017-01-12 00:35 EST suffering from pain in intervertebral disk, shoulder The official Twitter account of Kadokawa's Monthly Comic Gene Servamp manga will go on hiatus beginning with the magazine's February issue on Saturday. \nThe magazine explained that Tanaka's intervertebral disk and shoulder have been causing her intense pain, which have rendered her unable to draw manga. She followed her doctor's advice to rest and recover. The magazine will announce when the manga will resume on Twitter and the magazine itself. \nSeven Seas Entertainment publishes the manga in North America, and it describes the manga: When a stray black cat named Kuro crosses Mahiru Shirota's path, the high school freshman's life will never be the same again. Kuro is, in fact, no ordinary feline, but a Servamp : a servant vampire. While Mahiru's personal philosophy is one of non-intervention, he soon becomes embroiled in an ancient, altogether surreal conflict between vampires and humans. \nTanaka launched the series in Monthly Comic Gene in 2011, and Kadokawa published the manga's 10th compiled book volume last July.
