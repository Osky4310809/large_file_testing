Yes! The little one is all set to perform on stage with her rockettes today and Twinkle decided to give us a glimpse of the same as she captioned the video saying, “The little Rockettes gearing up for their stage performance #CuteCrackpots.” Trust me, this boomerang video is instantly going to take you back to your childhood. I mean, at least I got reminded of my school days the second I watched the video – when we used to have those little stage performances by dressing up in matching outfits. Well, thank you Twinkle for lifting up our moods with this adorable video.

I mean, for all that we know, for the longest time both Twinkle and Akshay Kumar have been against the idea of posting any pictures/videos of their kids on social media or exposing them to the paparazzi, unless the pictures are taken from the back. But guess with this latest video, the rules are changing; probably for the good? \nWatch the video below: A post shared by Twinkle Khanna (@twinklerkhanna) on Feb 27, 2017 at 7:49pm PST \nWhile Twinkle’s referred to Nitara as her ‘cute crackpot’. Akshay feels she is going to be a little Ninja as he’d even mentioned in one of his interviews saying, “I wish I could hold her hand for the rest of her life, but I know that that’s just a father’s dream. Whether she likes it or not, she will have to learn these self-defence techniques. I already have a feeling that Nitara’s going to be a little Ninja. There is power in her big brown eyes, and I can’t wait to put that to some good use.” \nOn that note, watch the video and do drop your love in the comments below. \nPublished: February 28, 2017 12:53 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:49:15.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
