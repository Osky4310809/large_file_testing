The tourists were 269 for 4 at the break. \nThe visitors, who resumed on their overnight score of 154 for 3, suffered an early setback when Tim Southee snuffed out Mominul Haque for 64. From round the wicket, Southee angled it into the left-handed batsman before it straightened to induce the edge. At that juncture of the match, New Zealand would have hoped to make further inroads into Bangladesh's batting line-up. \nRahim and Shakib, however, hauled the visitors out of a tricky position with a brisk unbeaten stand of 109 for the fifth wicket. The veteran batsmen were rewarded for their pragmatic, workmanlike approach towards building the innings. \nShakib presented a stout blade to defend good deliveries. However, as soon as Southee offered any width, he tailored the ball into gaps with cut shots. At the fag end of the session, he also crunched a couple of drives off Southee and compiled his 20th Test fifty. Shakib found an able ally in Rahim. The pair frustrated the opposition with sharp running between the wickets. \nWith the veteran duo largely untroubled by Southee and Trent Boult, Kane Williamson introduced Neil Wagner into the attack. The left-arm seamer, known as the 'enforcer' of the pace attack, banged a few short deliveries to trouble Rahim. \nHowever, the credit has to go to the wicketkeeper-batsman for either standing tall to ride on the bounce or keeping his eyes on the ball to sway away from the line. Rahim also completed his half-century in some style with a slog-sweep off Mitchell Santner. \nWagner changed angles and bowled from round the wicket. Williamson also had a deepish forward short leg and a leg gully in place, but New Zealand couldn't make the breakthrough. \nIt has been a gusty performance from Bangladesh so far. Mominul and Tamim Iqbal cracked fluent fifties yesterday, while Shakib and Rahim have blended style and substance to stitch a century stand on Day 2. The visitors will look to continue their good work in the second session and compile a substantial total. \nAs only 40.2 overs were bowled on Day 1, play started 30 minutes early today. In total, 98 overs are expected to be bowled on Day 2. \nBrief Scores : Bangladesh 269/4 (Shakib Al Hasan 66*, Mominul Haque 64, Tamim Iqbal 56; Neil Wagner 1-57) vs New Zealand © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:36:39.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
