Source: Supplied \nPrivately, Stuart is saying only it is still too early to make a call. \nBut Raiders insiders insist while Taylor has done everything right since arriving at the club in a train-and-trial capacity in November, he still has plenty of hoops to jump through if he is to earn a contract before the season kicks off in March. \n“Ultimately, he has to completely win over Ricky Stuart and the coaching staff,” one source said.

And that means he has to convince them he is prepared to fit into the strong culture that’s been created here. \n“There is a lot more to it than just putting in at training, eating right and shedding the kilos. \n“In the end, it will boil down to how badly Dave Taylor wants it.” Taylor has shed 9kg during Canberra’s pre-season campaign. Source: Supplied \nStuart has had a major influence on Raiders stars like Joey Leilua and Junior Paulo, who both arrived at the club with troubled off-field reputations. But helping resurrect Taylor’s career shapes as his biggest coaching challenge. \nSince making his debut for Brisbane in 2006, the 28-year-old has played 170 NRL games for the Broncos, South Sydney and the Gold Coast before playing last season with Catalan Dragons in the English Super League. \nAt his best, he was one of the game’s most destructive forwards. He played for Australia in the Anzac Test against the Kiwis in 2012 and has made eight Origin appearances for the Maroons. \nHis career began to unravel in 2014 when he was one of eight Titans players charged with drugs offences before pleading guilty to two counts of cocaine possession.

Source: News Limited \nTaylor avoided a conviction and a community service order when he faced Southport District Court last November, escaping with a $1000 fine that left him free to continue his bid to resurrect his career with the Green Machine. \nThe NRL’s Integrity Unit is likely to put any contract request from the Raiders under the microscope before it gives the green light.
