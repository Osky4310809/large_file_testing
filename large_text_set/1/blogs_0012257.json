You have to have other guys who can do it if, God forbid, something happens. I think that’s been our strength.”\nRick Nash, sidelined for the past eight games, will be in the lineup and so will Pavel Buchnevich, recalled after playing three games for the AHL Wolf Pack following a nearly two-month absence with disk and core issues. Mika Zibanejad, sidelined since Nov. 20 with a broken fibula, took his first full practice with the squad Thursday. He will not suit up Friday or in Saturday’s contest at Montreal, but he could be back for Tuesday’s game at the Garden against the Stars.\nZibanejad won’t be the only Ranger missing from this unique match between clubs coming off their respective bye weeks. Marc Staal, officially in the NHL concussion protocol, did not practice and is sidelined for an indefinite period. Jesper Fast, who also did not skate, is highly doubtful after having lost eight pounds this week suffering from the flu. Matt Puempel remains on IR with post-concussion symptoms.\nStill, it’s coming … barring future, unforeseen matters that might intervene. When and if the gang is all here, the Rangers should be able to roll out the kind of four-line skill and firepower that created early momentum off of which the club has fed.\n“When you think of it, what percentage of games does any team have its full lineup?” Henrik Lundqvist asked rhetorically. “But it will be interesting to see what we have when we’re all together.\n“At the same time, our depth has been so important to us, not only when we had injuries but from the start of the season. We have four lines that can play offense and defense. When we get guys back, obviously that can only help us.\n“Everyone will have to be on their toes to earn their minutes.”\nThe formidable Rangers line of Mats Zuccarello (left to right), Derek Stepan and Chris Kreider Getty Images The Chris Kreider-Derek-Stepan-Zuccarello unit will remain intact, as will the Michael Grabner-Kevin Hayes-J.T. Miller trio. Oscar Lindberg skated between Buchnevich and Nash at practice while Marek Hrivik centered Jimmy Vesey and Brandon Pirri. Odds are Zibanejad will take Lindberg’s spot with Lindberg in turn bumping Hrivik (if not Pirri) when and if the top 12 all are healthy. \nVigneault smiled longingly and said he would “keep his fingers” crossed when asked about reuniting Zibanejad and Buchnevich, who played five games together — that’s all, five — before the Russian rookie went down. Remember, though, how well Kreider, Zibanejad and Zuccarello meshed when they were together for a half-dozen games early in the season.\nThe Rangers have seven games before another five-day vacation for the All-Star break. If the club is ready to go, so for certain is Lundqvist, who has started just 28 of the first 42 contests, his leanest comparable workload since his 2005-06 rookie season, when he got the nod in 26 of the first 42.\n“It’s not only about how you feel physically, but mentally, as well. I’ve had stretches where I played 20 straight and felt great and times where I played in three in a row and was tired,” Lundqvist said. “In the long run, I’m sure this will help, but I can’t tell right now.\n“I haven’t played all that much, lately. We had Christmas break, the bye week, I was sick for a game, and I sat out four straight. So I’m ready to play. I want to go out and see a lot of action.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:04:36.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
