Advertisement - story continues below \nJMP was demanding records detailing leaks from FBI sources to Gen. Michael Flynn and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani after both men made comments in the media concerning the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email server while head of the State Department. The lawsuit noted that Flynn and Giuliani attributed their information to contacts within the FBI. \nThe public certainly has a right to know if there is any substance to the claim that Russia interfered in the election — a claim that if proven false would destroy the liberals’ attempt to discredit Trump’s election once and for all. \nWe also deserve to know if unauthorized leaks were made by the agencies that are supposed to protect us and our country’s sensitive information. \nDo you think this lawsuit will be successful in getting the information it demands?
