However, in this particular video featuring Lane attempting to hype up FAU football, the head coach sounds, let’s just say, a little less than enthused. \nCommit to the Owls! Coach @Lane_Kiffin is bringing in the best recruits. Now we need the best fans! \n\nCommit Today! https://t.co/Z6u9knOFu9 pic.twitter.com/KGMAFYDmD3 \n— FAU Football (@FAU_Football) January 27, 2017 Okay, the first observation right off the bat here is why on earth did they have Lane stand facing the sun?! I mean, look at the guy’s face having to squint straight into it. \nThere’s also the fact that Lane’s quite monotone throughout this whole thing. To be fair, I’m not sure if he’s been quite the most enthusiastic guy, outside of him celebrating Alabama touchdowns early while on the sidelines, but come on, coach. \nThe message here overall is a solid marketing campaign — promoting both National Signing Day this Wednesday, and the upcoming 2017 season as a whole. Maybe Kiffin needs to practice on his persuasive speaking just a bit. \nJust two days before Signing Day, Kiffin’s 2017 FAU class is ranked 82nd in the country per 247Sports Composite , with 15 verbal commits.
