This is heaven!). The actor does full justice to the condom brand with his perpetual I-am-about-to-climax energy that, despite his stardom, has remained redbull-charged through the years. Now, for reasons that are beyond human cognition, Durex has decided to jump straight into the apparel segment with a collection of jeans… yep, this is not an early April Fools’ Day prank. As you read this, Twiterrati are having a field day since the actor took to the platform to drop this epic newsbomb in a 16-second video. The teaser has the actor emerging out of shower curtains(of course) to announce his debut in the one-off denim range. Durex is launching Jeans! Designed for the passionate!
