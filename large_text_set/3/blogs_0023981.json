The film has got UA status, which means that kids can go watch it as long as they are chaperoned by an adult. However, three scenes have been cut from the film. One is a shot of a bottle of liquor, the other is a Santa Banta joke, and the third is a scene of domestic violence. A CBFC source said, \"Hitting a woman is not permissible under any circumstance. Today, if we had to certify films about domestic violence like Deepa Mehta's Heaven On Earth , or Jagmohan Mundra's Provoked , it would be impossible. \" Lets slow clap for living in denial, everyone.
