As if those two things go together. \nAt the time, the non-profit BGEA, run by anti-gay evangelist Franklin Graham (Billy Graham’s son), had bought newspaper ads in 2012 urging voters to back an amendment against marriage equality. That’s perfectly legal. However, they also bought ads telling Christians to vote for candidates who opposed gay marriage and supported Israel. That’s perilously close to crossing the line, since non-profits aren’t allowed to endorse candidates if they want to maintain their tax exemptions. \nSo the IRS took a look at the organization — on its own, by the way, not because Obama told them to — and concluded that the BGEA didn’t do anything wrong . Their tax exemption was still valid. \nAnd yet Starnes is now using that incident as evidence that Obama probably wiretapped Trump’s phones . Because #ChristianLogic. \nThe BGEA’s only crime against Obama was to urge voters to back candidates who base their decisions on biblical principles. They also supported an effort to support traditional marriage in the state of North Carolina. \nI believe the government used the power of the IRS to silence dissent and punish those who refused to comply. \nThey targeted Billy Graham, America’s pastor. Just let that sink in, folks. \nSo if the Obama administration went after Billy Graham, it’s not out of the realm of possibility they wiretapped Donald Trump. \nObama didn’t go after Billy Graham. \nThe IRS merely looked at a non-profit that may have broken the rules… and said it didn’t. \nNot that Starnes ever let evidence get in the way of his conspiracies. \nIs it possible that the Obama administration wiretapped Trump Tower? Is it possible that government workers loyal to the previous president have been leaking sensitive information to the media? Is it possible there is an active plot to take down the Trump presidency? \nIs it possible that Starnes makes things up because the facts routinely go against the false narrative he’s trying to promote? \nIs it possible that he’s so desperate for attention that he’ll say anything to get clicks? \nIs it possible he’s wrong again and will never apologize for being an embarrassment to journalists everywhere? \nYes. Yes it is. \nAnd that’s why Charisma , the Christian news outlet with no journalistic credibility, is reprinting Starnes’ bullshit without question. As long as you suggest there’s a conspiracy against Christians, they’ll print anything you send them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:23:10.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
