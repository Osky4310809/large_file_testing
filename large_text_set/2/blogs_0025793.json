It’s clear that they’re always hanging out and doing fun things together , not because they’re genetically connected, but because they legitimately really like each other.\nDakota is celebrating her golden birthday today by turning 23 years old on the 23rd of the month! Side note: We can’t believe she’s already in her mid 20s — it feels like she played Sally in Cat and the Hat like five minutes ago.\nObviously, golden birthdays are a big deal, so Dakota is deserving of all the birthday love today, and she’s definitely getting it. Specifically, from her younger sister who seems to adore her just as much now as she did when they were kids. Elle posted a throwback video to Instagram of the two of them singing and dancing to the song “ Santa Claus Lane.” And, you guys, “adorable” doesn’t even do it justice. \nA post shared by Elle Fanning (@ellefanning) on Feb 23, 2017 at 10:27am PST \n“This video pretty much sums up our sisterhood. Copying you since the ‘Santa Claus Lane’ days,” Elle captioned the video. “I love you and wish I was there to bring in your golden birthday with you! #bootyshake @dakotafanning” It’s a bummer that the sisters aren’t able to celebrate Dakota’s big birthday together, but hey, when you can’t be there in person, the next best thing is an Instagram shout out! The way Elle copied Dakota’s every single move is so freaking cute, and so incredibly normal for the youngest of two sisters. She continued to “copy,” or follow in her sister’s footsteps, by becoming an amazingly talented actress.\nWe heart the Fanning sisters and hope Dakota has the best birthday yet!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:51:00.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
