ADVERTISEMENT \n“I think you can win ‘The Voice’ like no problem,” Levine declared. “I’m very surprised that this was not a four-chair turn…Correct me if I’m wrong but when you started singing you seemed like you were nervous.” WATCH: Fil-Am turns heads in ‘The Voice US’ with Bruno Mars hit \n“But then as the song progressed, you came through in a way that just blew my mind. You’re unbelievable and you belong on my team,” Levine added, promising Borromeo that he would help her nurture her singing skills even further. \nDespite not pressing the red button for her, judges Gwen Stefani and Alicia Keys commended her performance and wished her success. \n“At the end of it, it was an incredible performance,” Shelton said, then throwing a jab at his rival coach on the show. “It would be a shame to see somebody screw that up for you like Adam.” In the end, Borromeo sided with Levine’s team. \nBorromeo, who currently lives in New York and previously signed with several production deals, is the second Filipino-American to stride through the said round of the TV series, after Villaranda.
