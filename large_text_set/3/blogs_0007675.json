According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport , Williams and the Cowboys came to terms on a four - year deal that will pay the wide receiver $17 million. ESPN.com's Todd Archer confirmed the news and added that $9.5 million of that is guaranteed. Williams burst on the scene in 2013 with 44 catches for 736 yards and five touchdowns as a rookie, and those numbers allowed him to rise up the Cowboys' depth chart in expedient fashion. The former third-round draft pick soon emerged as one of Dallas' top receiving threats on the outside, and he piled up a career-high eight touchdowns on 37 catches in 2014. Williams' scoring output declined the following season, but he still found success with a career-high 840 yards on 52 receptions. Williams was able to maintain a regular role in the Cowboys' receiving corps thanks to that steady production, but he was overshadowed in 2016 by Dez Bryant , Cole Beasley and Jason Witten. As a result, his target share decreased by roughly one-third, with Beasley emerging as quarterback Dak Prescott's preferred No. 2 option alongside Bryant.
