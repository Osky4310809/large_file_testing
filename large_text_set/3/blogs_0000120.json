It's good that it went over well, as it very well could be the final trailer. \n@HotS0upSki This is the final film trailer that will play in theaters. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) March 1, 2017 \nGuardians Vol 2 Director James Gunn (who's film sits at a current rating of 4.36 out of 5 on ComicBook.com's anticipation rankings ) was asked on Twitter if there would be one more trailer in April, or if this was the final one. Gunn replied, \"This is the final film trailer that will play in theaters.\" \nNow, notice he added the caveat \"in theaters\", so it might not be the final trailer released to the public. The good news for fans is that even if there is one more trailer, the story is still going to retain some of its mystery, something Gunn addressed in response to another tweet. He said, \"I’m incredibly appreciative to the fine folks in marketing for working so hard to give you all the film’s flavor while giving away so little.\" \nI’m incredibly appreciative to the fine folks in marketing for working so hard to give you all the film’s flavor while giving away so little https://t.co/iMmlMdkVFk — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) March 1, 2017 \nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos.
