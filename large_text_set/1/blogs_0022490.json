And though she most assuredly received a gift or two herself, Keys was kind enough to share her special day with the rest of us in the form of a new song. It’s called “That’s What’s Up,” and it happens to be built around a Kanye West sample. Listen to it below via SoundCloud.\n\n“That’s What’s Up” borrows extensively from “Low Life,” a track on Kanye’s opus from last year The Life of Pablo . It borrows the same spoken word intro, before using the song as a showcase for Keys’ powerhouse vocals. \nThis release comes hot on the heels of “ Sweet F’in Love ,” another one-off single Keys dropped earlier this month. That song was an inspired pairing of the singer with producer-of-the-moment Kaytranada, and together they spun pure sonic gold. \nLast year Keys released her sixth studio album Here . Watch the video for “Blended Family” featuring A$AP Rocky below.\n\nIn other music news, Gucci Mane has just dropped a surprise EP titled 3 For Free. Listen to it right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T10:58:20.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
