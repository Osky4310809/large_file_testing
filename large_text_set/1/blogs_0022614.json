I mean “Thursday night games are better by every barometer” is one of the most outrageous lies I’ve heard since the last time someone tweeted a Sean Spicer video clip onto my timeline. Granted, I don’t have the best memory but the only entertaining Thursday night game I can recall was Steelers vs Ravens and that Thursday Night Football game was on a Sunday, s . I don’t care if stats say passing percentage is up and penalties are down on Thursday nights, the flow of the game is absolute dogshit and is horrible football (though, to be fair, most of the games were horrible football this year). Sure, the Color Rush jerseys are super sweet but the rest of TNF is garbage and even the players hate it. I do have to tip my cap to the spinzone of “Sure the vets can barely move on the morning of their game but after that it’s a mini-bye week” though. That’s some elite subterfuge right there. \n\n\nAs for the whole “I’d be honored to give Tom Brady a trophy, it wouldn’t be awkward” is so hilarious I can’t even stand it, because I’ve heard that conversation a million times. Ever going out with high school or college friends and you hear that someone’s ex is going to be there? “Oh no man, don’t worry. It’s cool. We’re totally fine. It won’t be a big deal at all.” \n\n*Jump Cut* \n\nTears and screaming and crying and “YOU CHEATED ON ME” and punches thrown and girls yelling at you because you brought him to the bar and all kinds of fucking chaos. \n\nSure, Roger. It won’t be awkward at all while you’re on the phone talking to Colin Cowherd, look the lion in the eye on Sunday then talk to me.
