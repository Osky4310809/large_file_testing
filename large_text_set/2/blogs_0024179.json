(Reuters) \nOscars 2017: African-American coming-of-age tale “Moonlight” won the Oscar for best picture on Sunday , beating favorite “La La Land” after an embarrassing onstage gaffe over the announcement. In a mishap that caused uproar and confusion, presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway initially announced that the romantic musical “La La Land” had won. As the casts of both films stood awkwardly on stage, Beatty explained he had been given the wrong envelope to open. “I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope and it said, “Emma Stone, ‘La La Land.’” “That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny,” Beatty said, breaking into tense laughter. It was Dunaway who ultimately said “La La Land.”“It is true. It’s not fake,” said “Moonlight” director Barry Jenkins. “My love to ‘La La Land,’ my love to everybody.” \nIt was the first time in living memory that such a major mistake had been made at the Academy Awards, Hollywood ’s biggest night. “Is that the craziest Oscar moment of all time?” Stone, who won the best actress Oscar for her “La La Land” role as a struggling actress, told reporters backstage “It’s a very strange happening for Oscar history.” Here is the full list of Oscar winners 2017 list: \nBEST PICTURE \nAdele Romanski, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner \nWATCH OSCAR ACCEPTANCE SPEECH \nACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE \nCasey Affleck \nACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE \nEmma Stone", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:46:34.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
