The Dancing With the Stars pro, who welcomed her first child , son Shai, with fiancé Maksim Chmerkovskiy earlier this month, took to Instagram on Wednesday to give fans a behind-the-scenes peek at what her life has been like since becoming a mother. WATCH: Peta Murgatroyd Gets Real About Her Post-Baby Bod In the pic, the 30-year-old dancer can be seen breast pumping as her glam squad gets her ready for the day. Before she shared the snap with her followers, Murgatroyd used a photo editing app to censor her right breast with a yellow star emoji. \"Multitasking mum duties,\" she captioned it. \"Can't stop the pump. I'm working on an exciting new project that I can't wait to share with you soon! ❤.\" A photo posted by Peta Murgatroyd (@petamurgatroyd) on Jan 25, 2017 at 9:15am PST The post comes just a few days after she got candid on her \"#Day17 postpartum.\" Since giving birth, Murgatroyd hasn't been shy about the struggles mothers face while trying to get back into shape. WATCH: Val Chmerkovskiy Can't Stop Gushing Over His 'Handsome' New Nephew Shai \"I think I'm doing ok.... and I'm actually fine with the rate at which my body is shrinking back,\" she captioned a mirror selfie. \"After 2 days back at the gym I'm feeling like the old Peta again. I definitely don't have my 6 pack, and I still have excess skin and rolls on my belly, however I feel good. After all, slow and steady wins the race!\" \"I knew I needed to get back into the gym for my own sanity, but I also remind myself (as does Maks ) that I still need to take it easy,\" she continued. \"I cannot jump yet and still can't run a mile, but the exercises I've planned out are a good start. Honestly, the hardest part for me is getting my core strength back. Day 1 I couldn't do a sit up, here's day 17 and I'm doing 70+.\" \"Ladies, we all have to start somewhere,\" she added. \"Being an athlete I pride myself on having a lean, strong physique, so believe me this has been a challenge to work through, but as long as you have a loving support network around you, you will be fine ❤ #theresnothinglikehardwork.\" A photo posted by Peta Murgatroyd (@petamurgatroyd) on Jan 21, 2017 at 1:44pm PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:18:21.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
