That it’s unsightly, unfeminine, even, somehow, dirty. They're told to get rid of it — all of it — from the time they hit puberty. In order to be conventionally beautiful, they must follow this unwritten rule, no matter their personal feelings about body hair or hair removal. Men, on the other hand, are allowed — expected, even — to keep theirs. In an attempt to expose the double standard imposed on women via long-standing cultural norms, a 17-year-old art student named Lalonie posted a pair of photos of her body hair to Twitter . One shows her armpit hair; the other, her happy trail. Captioning the photos, Lalonie wrote: \"body hair positivity post bc i’d never let misogynistic opinions dictate what i do with my body.\" You May Also Like Lifestyle Vaginal Discharge: How to Tell If Yours Is Normal According to the Huffington Post , Lalonie posted the images after receiving a slew of hateful comments on a YouTube video in which her body hair was visible. She explained: \"I thought about how such negative backlash could affect a girl's self-esteem and personal choices to the point where they completely let the misogyny and double standards of our society dictate their choices…I posted that picture to let everyone know that I do what I want with my body and it’s okay for anyone else to do that, too.\" Slightly unrelated, but can we also talk about how much she's slaying her makeup? https://twitter.com/SLAYLONIE/status/844698655563001857 As of today, Lalonie’s post has been shared more than 7,500 times, and liked about 19,500 times. Unfortunately, not all of the responses to the teen's photos were positive. Many Twitter users called her visible body hair \"sloppy\" and “unclean,” while others simply voiced their discomfort with seeing female body hair. Interestingly, the negative reactions to the photos underscore Lalonie's point perfectly . As she says, \"The fact that [the post] went so big just shows what a big stigma there is surrounding body hair on women….There are so many microagressions and double standards that are very prevalent in our society…men can post plenty of pictures of them shirtless with chest hair and armpit hair, but a girl posting a positive picture about her armpit hair and a happy trail? Absolutely unheard of!\" Plus, more on fighting cultural beauty standards:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:58:39.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
