An individual who lacks the present ability to communicate his or her gender identity shall retain the gender identity used by that individual prior to losing his or her expressive capacity. \nThe bill will go before the Human Services Committee on Tuesday. \nThe Pacific Justice Institute, a non-profit legal organization, sent a letter to the committee opposing the bill on free speech and religious freedom grounds, arguing that it would target religious-based organizations. \nThe group claimed that the bill has practical issues, too, noting that “if some poor soul suffers from delusions causing them to believe that they are someone famous, as the Bill stands the staff would be required to call the individual Napoleon or whomever historical figure the resident is fixated on.” \nTransgressions under the bill constitute “a violation of either the Long-Term Care, Health, Safety, and Security Act of 1973, the California Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly Act, or specified provisions providing for the licensure and regulation of health facilities,” according to the legislative counsel’s digest, which adds, “By expanding the definition of existing crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.” \nOther bills recently introduced by Wiener include one that “Makes it safer and simpler for cannabis business owners to pay state fees and taxes” and another that requires certain residential or construction projects to include the installation of solar panels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:29:08.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
