Jonathan Ashworth is worried the Government isn't valuing nurses \nThe RCN said the staffing situation is already bleak, with 24,000 jobs unfilled in England – and one in three nurses to retire in the next 10 years. \nShadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth blamed the “negligent” Tory Government for the shortfall and called on Ministers to guarantee the rights of EU nationals here after Brexit. \nHe said: “The Government ought to value and protect Britain’s EU nurses, doctors and midwives, not leave the threat of uncertainty hanging over them as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Brussels.” One in three nurses are set to retire in the next 10 years (Photo: Getty Imagess) \nThe warning came after Labour said it would not back the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal unless it secures the “exact same benefits” as being in the EU’s single market. \nIn a speech today, Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer will set out six key “Brexit tests” for Theresa May as she prepares to trigger Article 50 on Wednesday. \nSir Keir will say: “All of us want the best for Britain. But the stakes are high and the Prime Minister’s approach so far does not bode well. The Prime Minister has refused to give any guarantees to Europeans living in Britain post-Brexit (Photo: Sky News) \n“Failure to meet the tests I have set out will of course affect how Labour votes in the Commons.” \nTheresa May has said repeatedly she can offer no guarantees to Europeans currently living in Britain until she secures equivalent rights for British ex-pats living abroad. \nMrs May travels to Scotland today to plead for unity as she prepares to start the Brexit process. She has vowed to visit every country in the UK before Article 50 is invoked. \nBut the PM’s trip to Scotland is controversial as it comes as Holyrood prepares to vote on a second ­independence referendum. \nMrs May will say that we must never allow “our Union to become looser and weaker, or our people to drift apart”. French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen told a rally on Sunday that the EU “will die because the people do not want it anymore”.
