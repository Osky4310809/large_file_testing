(PTI) \nWith just a day left for campaigning of the BMC Polls 2017, the Shiv Sena has come out all guns blazing against the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ), alleging that the BMC Improvements Committee, which is headed by the saffron party, in a fit to gain votes had sold many plots in Mumbai to developers who were close to BJP. \nAddressing a press conference on the final day of campaigning, Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shewale told, “BJP has sold many plots in the city to the developers close to it in last many years. The committee has been headed by the BJP and has been influenced by senior BJP leaders in its functioning.” \nTaking a jibe at Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, the Shiv Sena MP alleged the CM pressurising civic officials to give a certain plot of BIT chawl in South Mumbai to a particular developer. He also said that the BJP of using the home department to win the forthcoming elections. \nYou may also like to watch this video : \nTalking about Mumbai’s BJP president Ashish Shelar’s claim of winning 114 seats in the BMC elections, Rahul Shewale termed Shelar as a match-fixer, which was evident from his winning predictions in advance. In a statement to The Indian Express, Shewale said, “It is clear that they have accepted the defeat. If the BJP does not win 114 seats, will Shelar and Fadnavis resign from their posts.” \nThe Sena MP further challenged the Maharashtra CM by urging him to make public the names of people that includes the name of a top industrialist whom he met on the night on November 8 ie. on the night of demonetisation. Shewale added, “The chief minister talks a lot about transparency. He should now make these details public for the sake of transparency.” \nHowever, the BJP reiterated by terming Rahul Shewale’s allegations as false. Speaking in defence of the Chief Minister, BJP’s chief spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said that the BIT chawl issue is pending in the Bombay High Court and the civic officials are working on it. He also cleared the air that, Fadnavis didn’t meet any industrialist on November 8 to hide anything. \nBhandari said, “Rather, I challenge them to declare names of contractors whom Shewale met, (and) the civic officials and the people who visited Matoshree at night.” He also told that BJP’s claims of winning 114 seats is their self-confidence and belief and not match-fixing stuff! He challenged Shiv Sena to declare their number o seats if they are confident of their stand.
