This is not something any child should experience. This visit has been extremely moving. Every single child I met is affected by this conflict and in desperate need of basic services such as clean water, psychological care and education to help them recover from the atrocities they have suffered and witnessed. They deserve a childhood.”\nThankfully, UNICEF has helped many families gain access to clean water, education, psychological support, vaccines, and treatment for malnutrition. \n“What can you do?” Orlando asked fans on Instagram . “Make a donation @unicef saving and making a difference in children’s lives 👶🏻👶🏼👶🏽👶🏾👶🏿.”\n45+ pictures inside of Orlando Bloom visiting families in Niger… ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:14:02.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
