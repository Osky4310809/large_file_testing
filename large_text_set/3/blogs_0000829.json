Don’t be surprised to see this very photo—or something very close to it—during Samsung’s presentation on March 29.\nSpeaking of March 29, that’s the very date that appears on the lock screen of the render. That’s not a coincidence.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com The new image once again confirms the Galaxy S8 won’t feature a home button, instead opting for Android’s built-in software navigation. The screen appears to be virtually edge-to-edge, much like the LG G6, along with curved edges.\nThe lock screen also appears to feature a tab on the right side, which will likely invoke Samsung’s edge shortcuts.\nIt looks beautiful The Galaxy S8 is shaping up to be not just the best-looking Android device on the market, but the most powerful, too. We’re expecting the handset to sport a Snapdragon 835 chip, 12-megapixel Dual Pixel camera, IP68 dust and water resistance, an iris scanner, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of expandable storage.\nThere will reportedly be a Galaxy S8 Plus, too, which is expected to sport a 6.2-inch QHD+ display and the same specs as the smaller Galaxy S8 model.\nSamsung will unveil both phones on March 29, allegedly followed by an April 21 release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T06:15:10.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
