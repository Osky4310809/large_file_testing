In a terrifying early scene, Anna appears to suffer a moment of catatonic paralysis, a kind of intensified transient ischemic attack: the chilling forerunner to a stroke. \nTo the astonishment and panic of her devoted husband Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) she is as still and calm as a statue, her face eerily resuming the beatific beauty of her youth. The moment was also captured on the poster. And afterwards – even more disturbingly – she carries on as normal pottering about the kitchen, remembering nothing. Riva in Amour. Photograph: c.Sony Pics/Everett / Rex Featur \nRiva’s performance as Anne also showed other things: her courage as her condition declines, her formidable personality as a musician, her heartwrenching desire never to be put in a care home, and then her calm determination as she tacitly cedes to her poor husband the terrifying responsibility of deciding when and how to carry out euthanasia when the situation becomes unbearable. \nBut Riva became an another type of icon in earlier era – the age of the New Wave. She was the image of pure contemporary sexiness as the beautiful, unnamed female character in Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959) who in long, ruminative dialogue scenes about love, memory and loss talks with her Japanese ex-lover (Eiji Okada) about the decline and fall of their relationship – boldly bringing in parallels with Hiroshima. Has the movie aged well? It certainly is of its time and its vehement, earnest alliance of the personal and the political – and the sexual and the ideological – is a kind of high-minded talky cinema that is difficult to imagine getting produced now.

RIva in Leon Morin Priest Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo \nSet near the Alps during the occupation, Leon Morin Priest shows a discontented, angry widow played by Riva. She is a communist and atheist and one day goes to confession, purely and simply to pick a quarrel with the priest – and this is Morin, an excellent performance from Jean-Paul Belmondo. Instead of the reactionary bluster she is expecting, this calm, thoughtful figure engages her in conversation and of course she falls passionately in love with him. It is a really sensual and sympathetic performance from Riva, as she becomes addicted to this extraordinary young priest who captures her heart with his own tales of childhood unhappiness. But he remains a man of the cloth and a celibate. It is an extraordinary moment when Riva has to go to confession again – to ask forgiveness for having tried to seduce him. \nWatching Amour and Leon Morin Priest are excellent ways to remember this great movie star.
