AMBODE \n“The bigger buses will take 70 people and then the medium range buses will take 30 people. We believe that the middle range buses will be supplied up to 70 per cent of the total volume which will amount to about 3,600 units and then the longer range in that direction,” he said. \nSpeaking on how the government intends to fund the initiative, the governor said that his administration would launch a public transportation infrastructure bond of N100 billion that would span between seven to 10 years, revealing that the Government already has a sinking fund which it intends to put into the bond. \nHe said aside the bond, his administration also intends to give out franchise to interested stakeholders in multiple of 50 buses each, 100 buses, 200 buses and above, explaining that what is required is a down payment of 25 per cent of the cost of the buses. \nHe, however, said that the state government expects the danfo drivers, who would be absorbed into the new initiative to adapt accordingly, saying that the transport unions would be expected to take ownership to ensure sustainability.’’ Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T04:06:54.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
