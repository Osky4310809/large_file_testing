She is author of Derby Life and The Insider’s Guide to Publishing Success. @MargotAtwell Apr 29, 2016 Poetry, in the Wilds of the Internet In a 140-character world, online tools are changing the way poets connect with readers When you ask people what they read for fun, poetry usually isn’t high on their list. Some people’s first (and only) encounter with the genre is through well-meaning teachers who push them to over-analyze a poem’s meaning, stripping away its joy and artistry in the process. In the words of former Poet Laureate Billy Collins, students “tie the poem to a chair with rope/and torture a confession out of it.” If a person’s only experience of poetry is as an opaque puzzle they’re forced to solve, it’s no wonder so many people wind up shunning the form. “Never alone, with you.” A piece of Pablo Neruda’s recently unearthed poetry. I studied poetry in college, reading Pablo Neruda’s works in translation under the guidance of larger-than-life professor Martín Espada. A poet himself, his booming voice and nuanced explanations of the poems helped me fall in love with Neruda’s work, and taught me to explore poetry and find its richness. I’ve kept in touch with friends from that class, and we’ve continued sharing our love of poetry. A few years ago, two of us bought copies of The Penguin Anthology of Twentieth-Century American Poetry edited by Rita Dove. Occasionally, one of us will still send the other a page number from the book, a subtle way to share a lot about what we’re reading or how we’re feeling. Try page 74 Poetry is at its best when it’s a living thing. And poetry performed can feel alive and accessible in a way that encountering a poem on a page does not. Every few months, a video performance of a poem tears through social media, even outside of literary circles. Sarah Kay’s 2011 poetic TED talk, “If I should have a daughter,” was viewed by more than 8 million people. The Button Poetry YouTube channel has more than 430,000 subscribers, and individual videos of poetry performances sometimes have millions of views ( Lily Myers’ “Shrinking Women ” has been viewed 5 million times; Javon Johnson’s “cuz he’s black” has been viewed more than 1.5 million times). These performances provide a way into a literary medium that might otherwise seem sterile or unapproachable. Javon Johnson on the Button Poetry channel Though poetry has long been a way for people to grapple with strong emotions such as doubt, fear, and grief, some might be surprised to find it welling up so naturally online. But poetry, with its intensity, portability, and succinctness, seems like a natural fit for our 140-character attention span. The form, with its intimacy and ability to surprise and delight, is flourishing on social networks, jumbled up with personal confessions, links to political screeds, and pictures of cats. Twitter’s #micropoetry is an active hashtag for tagging tiny poems or excerpts of poetry, while #MSpoetry acts more like a Twitter-based writers group, with people responding to prompts and sharing their work. Poets on Instagram, like J Iron Word and r.h.sin , have tens or hundreds of thousands of followers, and an individual poem can get thousands of likes — both an indication of how many people are reading the poem and a kind of instantaneous public feedback loop that’s impossible to achieve via traditional publishing channels. Poetry has long been politically charged — the trope of poet-as-activist is well established among poets like Federico Lorca, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, and Audre Lorde. That hasn’t changed as the delivery system has gone digital. Recently, I’ve seen incandescent work by the 26-year-old London-based Somali poet Warsan Shire blazing through Facebook and Tumblr, articulating grief too big for most of us to speak. An excerpt of one poem, “What They Did Later That Afternoon,” has been especially popular, and feels particularly resonant at a time when horrific acts of violence from across the globe play in a constant loop in the news. “later that night i held an atlas in my lap ran my fingers across the whole world and whispered", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:06:07.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
