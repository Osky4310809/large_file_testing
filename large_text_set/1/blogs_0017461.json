They apply gentle pressure on acupuncture points that correspond to areas of the body. \nShe says ear seeds can help with a host of problems, ranging from back pain to asthma to allergies. \n“It really helps people reduce their intake of medication,” Alvarez says. \nShe says more physicians are recognizing that alternative therapies like ear seeds can be helpful. \nInternist Eric Applebaum says he prefers if patients talk to their doctors first before trying it but says he’s “all for people going down that road” as an alternative. \nThis was Julia’s second treatment. Lisa Alvarez caps it off with a tiny gold tack inserted in the ear to help her stay calm. \n“It’s instantly calming,” she says. \nTypically, patients keep the seeds in for four to five days. \nTreatments are around $30. Some people go in on a regular basis; others are helped by just going in now and then.
