By June Thomas \nOn a day when those of us in the liberal bubble are facing social media feeds overflowing with sadness and despair, there is one exception to the unremitting gloom: Whether traveling by plane, train, bus, or automobile, women heading to the nation‚Äôs capital to attend the Women‚Äôs March on Washington are encountering random moments of transportation camaraderie along the way. \nThis morning, while driving to the city, Slate ‚Äôs Nora Caplan-Bricker came across a group of women, one of whom was handing out pink pussyhats at a New Jersey rest stop. One of the carload was still knitting en route. (Don‚Äôt worry, she was a passenger.) Knitters for peace, justice, and equality. Nora Caplan-Bricker Advertisement \nA DoubleX staff writer‚Äôs buddy told her: \"My bus down to DC is 90% women wearing beanies and reading comics about patriarchy and like one dude who works for the NYtimes.\" Meanwhile, a Facebook friend announced: Just left Penn Station on Amtrak, headed to D.C. for tomorrow's march. Over the intercom, the conductor acknowledged the march, told us to be safe, and said, \"Power to the people of these United States.\" And my car erupted with applause. \nAnd judging from the many photos of packed planes full of soon-to-be marching women, the inauguration protest is providing a big boost to the airlines. \nAndrea Addario reported that on her packed plane from Toronto Friday morning, 90 percent of the passengers were headed to the protest. ‚Äî Andrea Addario (@addarioandrea) January 20, 2017 \nLandings were particularly emotional. A Facebook friend reported that when her plane hit the ground, ‚Äúa booming voice from the back of the plane yelled, \"March on, Women!\" and the plane erupted into cheers and applause\" \nThe trip also provided many reminders that nasty women are everywhere, including on the staffs of the nation‚Äôs airline companies. Southwest Airlines is said to have turned D.C.-bound planes‚Äô lighting pink in honor of the march, and Spirit Airlines should be particularly proud of this sassy flight attendant . Love a nasty woman flight attendant üëè Starting our wknd of amazing women because we can't give up! @SpiritAirlines #WomensMarchOnWashington pic.twitter.com/bWj89inKtJ ‚Äî Flor Blake (@FlorBlake) January 20, 2017 \nJune Thomas is a Slate culture critic and editor of Outward, Slate ‚Äôs LGBTQ section.
