Uncle Sam is Hussain's character who presents as a stereotypical Muslim cleric, first appearing on the hilarious TV show Salam Caf√© . Here he is visiting the majority anglo-saxon Melbourne suburb of Frankston, to see what they \"know\" about Muslims.\n\nOr impersonating Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. He's a master of incredible skits on his show, Legally Brown . \nBut he's also an excellent stand-up comedian too. Both on his own... \nAnd as one half of stand-up duo 'Fear of a Brown Planent' alongside fellow comedian Aamer Rahman. \nWhile Hussain will be saving the world soon with Bill Nye, he was saving taxi drivers first. Or showing how hard people try not be racist... kinda. And alongside fellow Australian export, The Daily Show's Ronny Chieng, he's been teaching people how to dance...like a white guy. In conclusion: Get ready to fall in love with Nazeem Hussain, world. That is, if you weren't already.\nBONUS: Finally, you can learn how to be the sexiest dancer in the club", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:40:01.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
