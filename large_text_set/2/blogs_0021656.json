Nothing there when you get in? Everything frozen? Here's what's going on!\nUpdate February 22, 2017: Pokémon Trainer Club is down and that means, if you use PTC to log in to Pokémon Go, you're currently getting the dreaded \"Failed to Log In\" error. (If you're using a Google account, you should be fine!)\nWe're currently looking into Pokémon Trainer Club log-in issues and are working on a fix as quickly as possible. Thanks for your patience.\n— Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) February 22, 2017 BREAKING: Pokémon Go 2 now LIVE! \nTrending: Hatch Gen 2 babies | Get Gen 2 evolutions \nGuides: Pokémon Go tips and tricks | Pokémon Go cheats \n\nDon't delete the Pokémon Go app and re-download thinking it will get you back playing faster. All it will do is force you to enter your account name and password over and over again until the servers are back online, making it harder for you to check and see if it's working. Just be patient, wait, and try again every so often.\nThis isn't caused by there being too many people playing — this is because of a problem with the servers. Pokémon Go developer Niantic is trying to connect and authenticate who you are, so they can log you in and give you access to you account. That includes everything from your trainer to your Pokémon, your gear to your goodies.\nNiantic is certainly aware of the problem and is no doubt working hard to fix it. So, everything should be back up and running as soon as possible.\nWhile this may have ruined your plans to out hunting right now, it does give you extra time for planning and strategy. We have a ton of articles to help you get the most out of the game — see our latest Pokémon Go tips and tricks here !
