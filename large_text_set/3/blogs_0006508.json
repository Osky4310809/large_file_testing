Holmes (-7), Daniel Berger (-7) \nWhat it means: Sunday in Mexico will boast a star-studded leaderboard and a battle of golf's heavyweights. Thomas, who now has a 59 and an ace this season, is trying to trying to lock down his fourth victory by March 4, a month before the Masters. Johnson, the No. 1 player in the world, is trying to win in back-to-back starts. By doing so, he'd become only the second player to win four World Golf Championships, joining Tiger Woods, who has 18. Making his return from injury, McIlroy could actually supplant Johnson at the top of the world ranking with a victory Sunday should DJ finish worse than solo fourth. And finally, there's the 46-year-old Mickelson, once again looking to win for the first time since claiming the 2013 Open Championship. \nRound of the day: Jordan Spieth vaulted himself from 1 over to 7 under with a bogey-free Saturday 63. He improved his score at the first hole by five shots from Round 2 to Round 3, going from a triple bogey-7 to an eagle-2. He followed up with six birdies and 11 pars to jump 29 spots into a tie for 10th. \nBest of the rest: There were lower rounds, but this has to go to Mickelson, who somehow authored a 68 while slapping it all over Chapultepec . His 3-under round featured six birdies, four fairways, three rules consultations, two hole-outs and one stolen ball. \nBiggest disappointment: The third man in the final group with McIlroy and Mickelson, Ross Fisher dropped from T-2 to T-14 with a 1-over 72. The Englishman didn't make a par for his first seven holes on the back nine, carding three birdies and four bogeys. \nQuote of the day: \"I know it looks bad. I'm just telling you it's true.\" – Mickelson, successfully lobbying for relief from a sprinkler in the woods, as (not) seen here: Phil's somewhere in there... pic.twitter.com/ac99x7Qs3C — Golf Channel (@GolfChannel) March 4, 2017 Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:46:28.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
