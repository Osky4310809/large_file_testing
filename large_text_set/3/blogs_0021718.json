Three years ago, fears of bombs in battery compartments led to a directive from Washington that all electronic devices must be powered on before being allowed in aircraft cabins. Since 2006, passengers have also been limited to carrying liquids, aerosols and gels in containers no larger than 100ml. As annoying as these restrictions may be, most travellers willingly defer to the higher wisdom of intelligence agencies whose primary purpose is keeping them safe. Nonetheless, the geographical limitation of this ban poses uncomfortable questions that will eventually need to be addressed. Let us accept, for the time being, that specific intelligence points to an imminent danger in allowing large electronic devices in passenger cabins. In this scenario, America’s decision to ban the items on nonstop flights from the Arab world—home to most Islamist terrorist groups—seems logical. But allowing such gadgets on flights from Europe, Asia, South America and other parts of Africa does not. Having breached security in a Middle Eastern airport, a suicide bomber could surely now transit through a foreign country before continuing his journey to America. At the time of writing just one European nation, Britain, has voiced a willingness to follow America’s lead with the electronics ban. As long as the measure is applied inconsistently around the world, neither the global air transport infrastructure nor America’s skies can be presumed to be safe. Given what passengers know about the nihilistic motivations of Islamist terrorists, it is best to give America’s intelligence agencies the benefit of the doubt, for now. They are well-placed to asses Al Qaeda’s operational capabilities and the concomitant weaknesses in airports around the world; we are not. Perhaps there is top-secret evidence showing how hubs like Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport are immune to threats that imperil ones like Dubai International Airport. But it is doubtful. As time drags on, this ban should either be extended to all countries, or allowed to expire. Anything else would be prejudicial and ineffectual.
