The support is going to be magnificent and I urge all Nigerians to come out and support their team’’, he said. \nAlso speaking in the same vein, the first Vice President of the Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi said that the year 2017 would be a good year to all Nigerians because of the good coach tinkering of the Super Eagles. ‘’It is indeed going to be a good year for us because we have a coach who shares our views.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T11:32:45.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
