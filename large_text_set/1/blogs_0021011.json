The pair canoodled on board a luxury yacht (Photo: FameFlynet) \nRecently while appearing on American comedy series Wild ’N Out, she was asked: “Every dude in here would really like to know how much of that booty is really real.” \nShe replied: “I’m gonna put you up on game. It’s real in your hands, but ya’ll don’t need to be worrying about booty that’s above your weight class.” \nLast year, Iggy thanked the plastic surgeon who gave her \"perky boobs\" .

Denying it is lame. I don't think you should be ashamed if you made a change to yourself, which is why I've spoken about the changes I've made, like with my breasts. \n\"Your perception of yourself can change a lot over time, so I think it's important to wait and make sure it's the right choice. Plastic surgery is an emotional journey.\" The couple paddle boarded (Photo: FameFlynet) \nThe Australian rapper has never admitted to having help with her bottom, but an expert cosmetic doctor told Mirror Online that Iggy’s figure shows tell-tale signs of a ‘butt lift’. \n\"Iggy has been quite open about cosmetic surgery in the past and her body has gone through a number of changes during her career,” Dr Esho of The Esho clinic commented. \n“From these photos it seems likely she may have undergone a procedure called the Brazilian butt lift (BBL), which is a popular treatment in my clinic. \n“This is where fat is grafted and removed from the the thighs and stomach using lipo suction tools such as the lipolife by Alma. Iggy Azalea has been open about plastic surgery in the past (Photo: FameFlynet) \n“The fat is then injected and sculpted into the buttocks giving a much more full, round and lifted bottom.” \nBut Dr Esho’s associate Dr Mccloskey added you have to be careful to avoid an “unnatural” look. \n“People must take care when this procedure as it's important to keep and ideal ratio between thighs, the waist and the buttocks,” he said. \n“Too much can give a very unnatural finish.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T17:12:14.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
