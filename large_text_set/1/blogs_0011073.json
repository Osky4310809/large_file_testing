At the London premiere of the new film, Diesel told some press that Paramount is already asking about the possibility of a sequel. \nWhen someone asked the actor about the possibility of a fourth film in the franchise (what would be his third), Diesel had no problem letting everyone know that the studio had already asked about the return of the main characters. \n“Well, it’s funny,” Diesel said. “I was in the middle of an interview and Brad Grey — who runs Paramount — calls me and says, ‘Will everybody come back to work in May?’ I’m like – everyone’s in interviews right now!” \nNot only does it sound like Paramount is down for another xXx movie, but it seems like they're ready to make another one sooner, rather than later. \nIf anything, this comment speaks to the overall quality of Return Of Xander Cage . If the studios are thinking about a sequel before a movie even debuts, it means they've got a good idea that the current film will be successful. \nIf the clips and trailers are any indication, xXx: Return Of Xander Cage will be the epic thrill ride we've all been waiting so long for. \nUP NEXT: New xXx Poster Revealed / Return Of Xander Cage International Trailer / Ranking The Fast And Furious Franchise The third explosive chapter of the blockbuster franchise that redefined the spy thriller finds extreme athlete turned government operative Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) coming out of self-imposed exile and on a collision course with deadly alpha warrior Xiang and his team in a race to recover a sinister and seemingly unstoppable weapon known as Pandora’s Box. Recruiting an all-new group of thrill-seeking cohorts, Xander finds himself enmeshed in a deadly conspiracy that points to collusion at the highest levels of world governments. Packed with the series’ signature deadpan wit and bad-ass attitude, “xXx: RETURN OF XANDER CAGE” will raise the bar on extreme action with some of the most mind-blowing stunts to ever be caught on film.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T05:17:53.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
