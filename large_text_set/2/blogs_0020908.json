But what was particularly interesting was Lohan's claims of being singled out at an airport because she was wearing a headscarf.\nSEE ALSO: Somali-American teen wears hijab on Kanye West's Yeezy NYFW show\nShe explained that while flying into New York recently, she got stopped because of her headscarf and was double-checked by security. Lohan doesn't always wear one, but said she happened to don one out of \"personal respect\" while leaving Turkey, where she had met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nWhat a dream it is for Mr. President Erdogan and The First Lady to invite me to their home. Their efforts in helping Syrian Refugees is truly inspiring 🙌🏻❤🌍 #peace starts now @a_boynukalin @hilalkaplanogut @rterdogan please for peace @therealdonaldtrump Alaikum Salam✋🏼 ✋🏽✋🏾✋🏻✋ #cleanslate2017 #theworldisbiggerthan5\nA post shared by Lindsay Lohan (@lindsaylohan) on Jan 27, 2017 at 1:53pm PST\nThe actress explained that she eventually took off the scarf after airport personnel asked her to, but the experience was jarring.\n\"What scared me was, in that moment, how would another woman who does not feel comfortable enough taking off her headscarf, feel? That was really interesting to me,\" Lohan said. \"I was a little intimidated.\"\nWhether or not she asked to remove the scarf, Lohan would not have been required to comply according to the British government's airport rights. \"If you’re wearing headgear for religious or cultural reasons, you can ask for it to be checked using a hand-held scanner so you don’t have to remove it,\" a government website states.\nSomething to keep in mind next time, Lohan.\nBONUS: Behold, the Trump mask.", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/7DdgBENJ.m3u8", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPyJp5yBC8z/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/7DdgBENJ.jpg", "https://www.gov.uk/airport-rights"], "published": "2017-02-22T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:26:10.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
