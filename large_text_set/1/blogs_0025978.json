By Mike Wendling BBC Trending 30 January 2017 Messenger Image copyright Twitter/@KeeganNYC Protests over Donald Trump's executive order banning nationals of seven countries from the US have engulfed one of Silicon Valley's biggest companies - even though Uber's chief executive has come out against the ban. \nAs anti-Trump activists gathered at US airports to voice their opposition to travel restrictions, a union representing New York City taxi drivers decided to weigh in. \nThe New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) called for an hour-long halt on pickups from John F Kennedy International Airport, the city's busiest. Image copyright Twitter/@NYTWA \nDemands for Uber rides from the airport increased and the company's surge pricing - where fares increase automatically according to demand - kicked in, until Uber announced on Twitter that it would suspend the surge . \nThe move was interpreted by some Trump opponents as an attempt to break the hour-long strike, and soon the hashtag #DeleteUber was trending on Twitter. \nThe campaign was kicked off by a Twitter story by prolific user @Bro_Pair , and by Monday more than 300,000 messages had been sent using the tag. Image copyright Twitter/@bro_pair \nSoon protesters were sharing screenshots of themselves removing the Uber app from their phone, and of negative feedback messages sent to the company. Image copyright Twitter/@scottbix \nBut Uber insisted that it was not trying to break the strike . Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick is a member of Trump's business advisory council and will be meeting with the president on Friday, details that were also seized upon by protesters. \nBut in a Facebook post on Sunday, Kalanick hit out at the executive order. \n\"Today we need your help supporting drivers who may be impacted by the President's unjust immigration ban,\" he wrote. Kalanick says his company is creating a $3 million legal fund to help drivers with immigration and translation services.

The organisation is supporting a class-action lawsuit brought by Uber drivers against the company which alleges that Uber misclassifies drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. And The NYTWA is also lobbying against proposed state laws that would benefit Uber and other ride-sharing companies. \nThe union didn't explicitly endorse the #DeleteUber hashtag, but in an interview Bhairavi Desai, the NYTWA executive director, criticised the company, saying: \"It's not shocking that Uber would put greed above social principles.\" \nUber wasn't the only company to be caught up in protest politics. After Starbucks promised to to hire 10,000 refugees in response to Trump's plan, the hashtag # BoycottStarbucks hit Twitter's list of top trends, propelled by thousands of messages mostly from Trump supporters. \nNext story: How to stop fake news Image copyright Facebook \nFake news became a huge issue during the US election campaign.
