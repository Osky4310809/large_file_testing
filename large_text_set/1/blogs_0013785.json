The company has quietly pulled the listing for the watch from the Google Store website.\nSee also: Google teaming up with LG for two new Android Wear watches, the Watch Sport and Watch Style 5 hours ago Even Motorola’s own site is no longer selling the Moto 360 (2nd Gen.), but if you are still interested in picking one up, it is still available from other retail outlets like Amazon . The smartwatch was first revealed over a year ago in the fall of 2015, and is listed as one of the devices slated to get the upcoming Android Wear 2.0 update, along with the Moto 360 Sport . Motorola has already stated it has no current plans to release any smartwatches in the near future, so we won’t be seeing any Android Wear 2.0 -powered successors to the Moto 360 anytime soon.\nAt the moment, the Google Store is only selling a few Android Wear devices : The Mission from Nixon, the Access Bradshaw and Access Dylan from Michael Kors, and the Polar M600 . While the number of devices currently available may be limited, Google isn’t letting its wearable OS fall through the cracks much longer. The company is rumored to officially release the new version of Android Wear on February 9. Those same rumors claim Google will team up with LG to launch two smartwatches with the refreshed OS, the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style , both of which are supposed to go on sale the next day on February 10. Other companies like Casio have also confirmed plans to release new Android Wear 2.0 watches later in 2017, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:40:41.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
