I just want him to play and that's all. \n\"He's the type of player who always wants to be on the pitch, never wants a rest.\" \nBauza’s focus at present is locked on steering Messi and Co. to the 2018 World Cup, with the 59-year-old convinced that Argentina can complete an enviable trophy collection for their star man. \n'Messi the only indispensable player' \nHe added: \"Some say the fact he's won nothing with Argentina means he's not the best in the world, not the most dangerous, not worth as much as some others. \n\"But we are going to try and win this next World Cup, which will make him one of the greatest of all time.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:18:17.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
