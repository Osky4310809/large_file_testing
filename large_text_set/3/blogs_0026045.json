It garners different reactions from people depending on their age, weight, marital and baby status. Questions asked by aunty jees differ for each section of the crowd, and most of the times, no matter what you do, there will always be someone with seemingly better life advice. It's like you will always come home either drunk, thoroughly depressed, or more drunk!! If the thought of having to be a part of social gatherings gives you heartburn, we bet these 10 gifs will perfectly describe your state of mind. You are trying to stay positive. Maybe this time no one will comment on your weight/marriage/baby/complexion/eating habits/job... You walk in completely confident but you immediately spot about seven relatives coming to you from all sides... OMG you need running shoes!! You are surrounded by smiling aunties, but you know it's only a matter of time till their interrogation starts. You try to find a way out... And then you spot this group #SistersForLife You all sit together, contemplating life... And everything seems well... till Druncle (A Drunk Uncle) walks in... You need an escape plan... fast!! You finally get to the desserts, and realise that it's almost over. You can breathe again. In fact, in your happy high state, you actually consider talking to the aunt and uncles, trying to explain your way of life. Till you realise that things are now the other way around, and people are ignoring you *MAJOR EYEROLL* You get home, grab some more wine, and phone a friend to rant! You also make a promise (kind of), to never go to a social gathering every again.
