Chelsea's goal machines? PSG's unstoppables? Who has the most prolific trios in Europe With 3-4-3 and 4-3-3 sweeping across the continent who has nailed the front trident? Share Who has the best front three in Europe? (Photo: GETTY;REUTERS) Share Get football   Thank you for subscribing!   \nThree man front lines are en vogue across Europe, from Barcelona's MSN to Chelsea's title chasing goal machines. \nStrikers and wingers have combined with each other to show off their pace, creativity and an eye for goal to wreak havoc on opposition defences. \nThis season has seen the emergence of new attacking tridents across the continent, some of whom have been exceptional thus far. \nBut who has the best? Here are our picks for the 5 most prolific trios in Europe’s top leagues... \nPSG – Emerson Cavani, Angel Di Maria, Lucas Moura Paris St Germain's Edinson Cavani (R) celebrates with team mate Angel Di Maria after scoring the first goal for the team during their Ligue 1 soccer match against Monaco at Louis II stadium in Monaco (Photo: REUTERS) Moura scores for PSG (Photo: Reuters) \nGone are the days of Cavani being deployed out of his natural position; Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s exit has seen the Uruguayan striker assume the mantle of PSG’s main goalscoring threat. \nCavani currently leads the Ligue 1 scoring charts with 25 goals, the most of any player in Europe’s top five leagues – perhaps unsurprisingly; he’s got no assists to his name. \nAlongside Cavani up front are Moura and Di Maria who have lit up Parc des Princes with their sublime displays. \nMoura has aided PSG with 8 goals and 3 assists whilst Di Maria has bagged 2 goals and provided 6 assists. \nThe domestic season hasn’t gone as planned for the Parisians with Monaco currently top of the pile in the Ligue 1. \nPSG are just three points adrift of Monaco, though, and with a trio who have amassed 35 goals and 9 assists, the Parisians still have a great chance of retaining their league crown. \nChelsea – Diego Costa, Eden Hazard, Pedro Hazard and Pedro wheel away after yet another goal (Photo: AFP/Getty) Pedro celebrates towards Costa (Photo: PA) Read More Marcos Alonso says team meals are helping boost Blues' spirit in title charge \nChelsea are on course to secure the Premier League title thanks to Antonio Conte’s tactical acumen. \nIt's mind boggling to think that Costa, Hazard and Pedro pulled off a disappearing act last term and are now key cogs in Chelsea’s title bid with 31 goals and 13 assists between them. \nCosta’s on-pitch antics have been reduced to the barest minimum as a result of Conte’s man-management skills. \nThe Brazil-born striker has channelled his aggression into scoring goals - his 15 goals and 5 assists can attest to that. \nHazard and Pedro have also piqued the interest of Premier League supporters with their mesmerising technical abilities as well as their improved productivity.
