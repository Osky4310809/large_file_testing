(credit: Mike DeNardo) \n“We can’t please everybody. But, I think we are in general pleased with what we are doing, taking into consideration the safety of the fans,” said Michael Stiles, Phillies Executive Vice President and Chief Operation Officer. \nThe Phillies are the sixth team in Major League Baseball to install the longer safety netting. \nStiles says safety outweighs the impact on the fan experience. \n“It’s a balancing act. But we didn’t agonize over it. We really got direction from our president Andy MacPhail, who is supportive of this idea to extend it,” he said. \nStiles says the Phils were already considering extending the safety screen when shortstop Freddy Galvis last season called for more netting after his foul ball struck a young girl in the face.
