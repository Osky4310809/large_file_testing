This week, Copenhagen-based photographer Adam Katz Sinding (the sole force behind Le 21ème) heads to Mercedes-Benz Prague Fashion Week to capture the city’s style set as they take in the Fall/Winter 2017 shows. Location: Prague, Czech Republic \nSeason: Fall/Winter 2017 \nKey Looks: A gloriously oversized glossy puffer (slide #4), an expert lesson in a lil’ cinch and tuck (#slide 7), and an impeccable “stripe-tease” (slide #18). \nEditor’s Notes: Here’s the second roundup of Prague’s killer street style looks, and the city’s fashion impresarios are back at it again with a slew of enviable looks. There’s plenty of jewelry in ballooned proportions, head-to-toe GUCCI, and statement outerwear. The main trend takeaway? Wear your shades, stunnas, and eye-googles at all times, and the more oversized and tinted, the better. The Czechs certainly don’t care if it’s completely gray and overcast, so why should you?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T11:19:37.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
