We knew that Lotte would come racing out of the blocks in the first 20 minutes, but we were also aware that that would play into our hands if we didn't concede a goal in that time.\" \nHead coach Thomas Tuchel was pleased to see his side deal efficiently with the trying conditions as Dortmund set up a semi-final meeting with Bayern Munich. \n\"I'm very happy because it was a very difficult match,\" he said. \"The pitch was difficult to play on, the opposition performed very well too. In fact, it all went as we expected. \n\"I'd like to pay a big compliment to my team. My players recognised that rather than just being about individual quality, it was about attitude, character and team spirit. That was crucial and that's why we won.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:14:28.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
