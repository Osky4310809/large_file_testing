When naming his candidates for MVP on Sunday, Cuban went with James Harden and LeBron James â€” before declaring that Westbrook wasnâ€™t even on his list. Mark Cuban says MVP is a toss-up between James Harden and LeBron James. Where is Russell Westbrook in that mix? \"He's not.\" \nâ€” Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) March 6, 2017 Mark Cuban says requirements haven't changed for Westbrook superstardom. Fifty wins and win a playoff series. \nâ€” Eddie Sefko (@ESefko) March 6, 2017 \nItâ€™s not crazy to place both Harden and LeBron above Westbrook on an MVP ballot. Harden is the NBAâ€™s most efficient scorer and is leading the league in assists, and James has managed to keep the Cavaliers in first place in the East, despite losing two starters to injury for a substantial portion of the season. \nThe good news for Westbrook fans? Itâ€™s possible that Cuban isnâ€™t being entirely serious. . @TheDrewTTU @RDubThree It's too much fun to troll sports media.
