More than 72 percent of voters supported protecting Social Security and Medicare from any cuts, while 22 percent said that policymakers should take steps to control the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare. \nOn Immigration: \nOn immigration, 49 percent opposed accelerating the deportation of illegal immigrants who have not committed a serious crime, while 40 percent supported Trump’s rigorous deportation policy. Regarding the so-called “Dreamers” —young people who were brought illegally to this country as children—63 percent said they should continue to be protected from deportation, while 22 percent said that the United States should remove that protection. \nOn repeal of Obamacare: \nOn the Affordable Care Act, the bane of Republicans since its passage early in the Obama administration, 17 percent want an immediate repeal, while 25 percent said Congress shouldn’t touch Obamacare at all, and nearly 50 percent said that Congress should repeal the law only after a comprehensive replacement plan is in place. \nThe poll surveyed 1000 registered voters nationwide from March 1-5. \n***", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T18:09:21.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
