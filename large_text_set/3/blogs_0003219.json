I can guarantee you - even if James Hetfield never writes another riff in his life, we have enough riffs and enough ideas for another 10 albums. \n\"I have an iPod that has 1,600 Metallica riffs on it. It's the gift that keeps on giving, it's like a cornucopia, it's endless!\" \nHe added: \"The issue is not creative or metal energy, the issue is - I don't know if we can make records like this in our mid-60s, our late-60s, our 70s. We'll have to see - we're definitely gonna go down trying, but we'll have to see if there's a point where the physical requirements become too big for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:43:53.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
