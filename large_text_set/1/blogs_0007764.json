He predicted his national-championship performance in 2012, back when he was a sophomore in high school.\nIf I get a chance to play in a national championship game, Imma go ham.\n— Deshaun Watson (@ShaunWatson4) February 5, 2012 He issued another prediction in 2013:\nMe. In a National Championship Game. I'm just waiting on that moment.\n— Deshaun Watson (@DeshaunWatson4) January 8, 2013 Watson was speechless after the game, saying after coming up short last year, he and Clemson worked extra hard to get back to the championship.\nWatson will enter the NFL Draft this season, and his incredible championship performance is not only a perfect ending to his college career, but a sure boost in his draft stock.\nNOW WATCH: An Olympian jumped up an entire set of stadium bleachers in 5 leaps College Football Clemson Alabama Crimson Tide", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/288436023137030146", "https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/166005816330162176"], "published": "2017-01-10T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T08:22:38.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
