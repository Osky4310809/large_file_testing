Image courtesy of Lee Brett By Matthew Sherman Updated January 28, 2017 . \nLee Brett coached Snooker at a young age and has adopted his many talents for pool and billiards. His new DVD, The Secret Art of Pool , has been a hit to date with all levels of players. Brett's DVD is a companion to the book of the same name now available through a variety of outlets including Amazon.com . \nVisit Lee Brett's Official Pool, Snooker And Billiards Site Four Stars - Learn And Enjoy \nI give this DVD my highest recommendation. Brett is a terrific sports coach who speaks confidently in his distinct accent and will rivet the player's attention to follow his advice through his nearly 2Â½ hour long presentation. He rightly instructs the student to do 90% of the game \"outside the box\" and outside their stance, including chalking with purpose, stroke and aim thoughts, and waving away negative stroke thoughts. \nI certainly agree with most of the concepts Brett teaches on his new DVD. He covers all the basics and also many advanced concepts, including: \ncontinue reading below our video LeBron vs. Michael: Who's Better? \n* Finding your natural rhythm \n* Two tests for finding the correct grip, the \"Tube of toothpaste test\" and Brett's \"Hit 'em over the head test\" \n* Two speeds of stroke to help simplify play, his \"little finger speed\" and \"all open fingers speed\" \n* Checkpoints for good form throughout the stroke. \n* \"Feeling the pinch for a good hit\" and tips on building a power piston stroke on a gradual basis, using different stroke lengths, extensions and speeds \n* A number of his unique aim systems including some clever tools for using sidespin, topspin and draw, along with very helpful advice for dead straight shots and near-straight cut shots with a natural adaptation to billiards throw that will help players find the \"pro side of the pocket\" \n* Rail bridges and open and closed bridge advice--alone these are worth the price of this DVD in my opinion Golf And Its Secret Relationship To Pool, Billiards And Snooker \nLike me, Brett teaches both pool and golf and exchanges helpful concepts between the two sports. I'm sure you'll find Brett's stylish and clear exposition of the forefinger and thumb V-grip in both sports fascinating. \nHis combination of the V-grip, hand on the rear of the cue stick and elbow drop will create immense power in the stroke for most players. He teaches his #1-5 shot routine that clearly covers sighting on the target, assuming a stance properly and on line, and stroking to a complete follow through. \nAs a teacher, Brett's great use of repetition will help hammer home the fundamentals for any player. He shows his special grip and stroke from multiple angles and in real time and slow motion for many of his shots. Pool And The Secret Pro V-Grip \nThe DVD also makes a great companion for further illustrating the \"V-grip\" beyond his Secret Art book: \nThe use of the V-grip has been coming into vogue with a variety of pros in recent years. It brings the adductor pollisis muscle (the meaty part of the web between thumb and forefinger into play. While not the ideal stroke for every player, (some readers already are playing at a high level with a pendulum-type stroke) when coupled with an accurate stance and alignment, the V-grip stroke allows for a piston-like stroke arm elbow to work with near-maximum efficiency. \nBrett's addition of a nice, high elbow held way above the table provides stroking room for the long follow through and piston cue stick path. One advantage of this stroke style is to limit the use of the wrist. No worries, though, you will still get absolutely tons of power, even on draw strokes. \nFor the big V, the cue stick rests in the fingers of the hand with a golf-like \"weak hand\" grip atop the cue stick to gently hold the cue. I like this method also because it emphasizes a full release and not muscle tension or arm tightness through the finish of the stroke. Brett walks the initiate all the way through his V technique, including tips to help remain aligned with a high-seated elbow on the backstroke. \nBrett further correctly emphasizes the opening and close of the last three fingers of the stroke hand, a must if you want to learn this type of billiards stroke and add it to your game. And if you learn Brett's stroke, and he certainly gives you enough details on his DVD to master it, your ultimate motion will have a pronounced elbow drop with no loop to it, with a firm-yet-not-too-firm grip and forearm tendons that power through the ball. If you're still uncomfortable with this different method of playing regular shots, I'd suggest trying it for monster break and jump shots regardless. \nVisit Lee Brett's website now for more information, or to order The Secret Art of Pool DVD.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:42:14.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
