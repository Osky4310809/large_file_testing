Image copyright Reuters Image caption The CIA is reported to have made use of previously unknown flaws in Apple's iOS operating system \nApple said it had already addressed some of the vulnerabilities. \n\"The technology built into today's iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we're constantly working to keep it that way,\" it said. \nSamsung - whose F8000 series of televisions was reportedly compromised - said that \"protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung\". \nThe leaks also claimed that the CIA had created malware to target PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system. \n\"We are aware of the report and are looking into it,\" a spokesman from Microsoft said. \nGoogle declined to comment about allegations that the CIA was able to \"penetrate, infest and control\" Android phones due to its discovery and acquisition of \"zero day\" bugs - previously unknown flaws in the operating system's code. \nThe World Wide Web Foundation - which campaigns for internet privacy - said the US government needed to issue a detailed response.
