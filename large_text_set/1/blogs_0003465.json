Charlamagne also suggested last month that black and Hispanic women need to follow Lahren’s example on social media. \n“On behalf of Charlamagne I’m sure he ain’t trading sides/Maybe I should meet Tomi Lahren, I’ll Lauryn Hill her/Train her, she miseducated anyway/Prolly hate the color of my face,” Wale raps. Advertisement - story continues below \nLauryn Hill is a female African-American singer and rapper who scored a hit with her 1998 album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill . \nLahren responded to Wale’s lyrics about her tweeting on Wednesday: I understand what a diss track is. Pretty sure @Wale just didn't research the correct spelling & pronunciation of my first AND last name.. \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 5, 2017 Advertisement - story continues below \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 4, 2017 Advertisement - story continues below \nAfter a day of reflection, Lahren tweeted on Thursday at Wale that they were “all good.” I guess if Eminem is Slim Shady, I'll take Tami Lauren. All good @Wale \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 5, 2017 \nWale also takes aim at President-elect Donald Trump in Smile , calling him a “bigot slash misogynist” who is “’bout to run the whole d— thing.” He also raps, “They think because Hillary lost the cards will be Trumped/You out you mind.” \nAs reported by Western Journalism , Lahren went head-to-head with The Daily Show host Trevor Noah last month covering hot-button issues including Trump, Black Lives Matter and national anthem-protesting quarterback Colin Kaepernick, and the conservative gave as good as she got. \nNoah questioned Lahren over what she sees as the purpose of her BlazeTV program, Tomi , in the political discourse, noting she has gained millions of views online due to her epic rants . \n“There is a segment of this country, between the coasts, that is largely ignored,” she explained. “The flyover states, if you will,” pointing out she’s from one of them, South Dakota. \nLahren continued, stating that Trump was able to win that portion of the country quite handily because the people “felt ignored by the mainstream media. [And] felt ignored by liberals and conservatives alike in D.C. I want to give voice to those people.” \nNoah went on to question Lahren on why she calls Black Lives Matter the “new KKK.” \nLahren conceded Black Lives Matter may have “started with good intentions,” but said it became permeated with the false Michael Brown narrative of “Hands up, don’t shoot” and members calling for the killing of police officers and white people and engaging in rioting and looting. Outside social media, most Americans aren't hateful. Most white people don't give a sh*t if you're black & vice versa. Divided we fall. \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 5, 2017 \nNoah later queried Lahren what she would like those from the liberal bubble to understand about her and those from her sphere. \n“I wish that we could disagree with each other without thinking that we are bad people or ill-intentioned folks,” she said. “I criticize Colin Kaepernick. That doesn’t mean I don’t believe in his First Amendment rights. It means I believe in my First Amendment rights to criticize him. So it doesn’t make me a bad person or a racist.” What do you think?
