Fashola \nSpeaking yesterday in Abuja when he appeared before the Senator Kabiru Gaya-led Committee on Works to defend his ministry’s budget, the Minister said that of the N260,082,997,390 budgeted last year as capital allocation for works, only N139,000,000,000, representing 53.4 per cent, was released. \nAccording to him, of the overhead cost of N572,970,849 budgeted in 2016, the sum of N338,711,291.26 was released for works between January and September, 2016, representing 59.1 percent.
