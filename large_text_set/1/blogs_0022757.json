Tariq will join Ford on January 30, coming most recently from Apple, where he was the company’s Global Marketing and Communication director for Retail. \nPrior to Apple, Tariq was senior director of social media and community at Nike, and before that he was Burberry’s first-ever social media lead. His unique blend of experiences should set him up well for Ford, since he has exposure on the fashion and lifestyle side, and plenty of tech perspective from his time at Apple. Automakers have always used lifestyle as a key messaging mode for their branding efforts, but the tech portion is relatively new to their approach – and yet increasingly important. \nTariq will report to both Ford’s EVP of Global marketing Sales and Service Stephen Odell, and to its group vice president for communications Ray Day, but the carmaker is clearly hoping to inject some fresh perspective into its branding efforts by bringing in a young exec like Tariq in such a senior role with such a broad mandate. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T19:51:28.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
