This is Judith from NIS America and I’m here to announce that Touhou Genso Wanderer will be available on PS4 and digitally on PS Vita tomorrow! In a previous blog post, my colleague Jordan introduced this game and what to expect from it.\nAs a roguelike with challenging, randomly-generated dungeons, this is a game that I believe all gamers will have a good time playing. I mean, who doesn’t love strategy and crazy dungeons full of Touhou characters? You can soon save the land of Gensokyo with Reimu and her chosen sidekick!\nSo what can you expect on launch day? A lot of things, so get ready! First thing’s first, for those of you who don’t know already, the PS4 edition of Touhou Genso Wanderer will come packaged with an additional game called Touhou Double Focus (on its own disc, too), and PS Vita owners will be able to access both games digitally via PlayStation Store!\n\nDouble Focus is a 2D platformer that puts the player in control of Aya Shameimaru and Momiji Inubashiri, two girls whose teamwork can kick a lot of butt. Aya and her party have been sucked into the Book World, so you’ll need to navigate through the huge map to get back to the real world, and the challenges you’ll meet along the way will definitely be worth playing.\nIn addition to all of that, Touhou Genso Wanderer will also have some pretty awesome DLC. For the first week of launch, Momiji Inubashiri, the adorable white wolf tengu who is often seen around Aya, will be available as a playable character in Touhou Genso Wanderer. Tackle the dungeons of Gensokyo as Momiji and see her awesome danmaku skills unleashed! This DLC is free for the first week of launch (until March 28), so be sure to get it when it’s out.\n\nBeat Touhou Genso Wanderer and want more? Fret not! The Futo Mononobe and the 7 Trials DLC will add an additional story and dungeon into the game on March 28, allowing you to play as Futo and introduces a new partner character named Tojiko. Beating this additional story and dungeon will allow you to unlock Futo as a playable character and Tojiko as a partner in the main game of Touhou Genso Wanderer!\n\nAnd if all of that wasn’t enough, we have one more DLC awaiting you to play! On the same day that Futo Mononobe and the 7 Trials launches, The Bullet Reporter will give you another story and dungeon to dive into, and completing it will unlock Aya as a playable character and allow Momiji to join the partner character roster!\nFinally, to top it all off, the developers of Touhou Genso Wanderer have created a 100% fan-requested PS4 and PS Vita custom Theme! You can download it for free on launch day and deck out your console with all the Touhou love you can muster.\n\nWhew. That was a lot of Touhou. Did you get all that? With all the content that you’re getting on launch day, I hope all of you have already planned out your schedules for the upcoming weeks. If you’re still unfamiliar with some of the things I just mentioned, you can learn more at the official website .\nUntil then, I’ll see you in Gensokyo, dood!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:24:13.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
