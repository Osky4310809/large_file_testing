During an Instagram Live video that’s since been deleted, Smith stated he’s ready to leave Los Angeles to find “happiness” and to tell his father, Will Smith , that he’s failed. \nThe video was posted to his account this week from a Department of Motor Vehicles parking lot. In a somber tone, Smith opened the meltdown to his five million followers by saying, “it’s gonna be so funny to tell my dad that I failed straight up.” \nWhat the 18-year-old was eluding to isn’t known, but he continued the video with more of his standard positivity and push for creative freedom. \n“Everyone follow your heart, OK? Do exactly what you want to do,” said a visibility distant Smith. “Be the you that you want to be. I’m about to move out of L.A. It’s a lot of bad stuff here.” \nSmith continued with, “Create the life that you want for yourself. Don’t try to be somebody else. And it’s hard these days to really create the life you want for yourself because there’s nobody here that supports the youth or the youth creativity.” \nThe video’s second portion shows Smith wondering aloud why aren’t people using Instagram Live to document positivity and scientific endeavors instead of focusing solely on superficial things. Smith adds that he has big plans in the works for 2017 that extend beyond clothing and music. \nPerhaps it was just a bad day for the Fresh Prince’s middle child, so hopefully he’ll bounce back to normal in no time.
