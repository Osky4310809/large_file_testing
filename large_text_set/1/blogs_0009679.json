The moment Kevin Demoff knew: when they were out at dinner and he watched McVay and Marshall Faulk banter back and forth about football.” Rams general manager Les Snead said it’s tough to get dinner with McVay because he’s so often talking about football. Demoff says he had dinner with McVay and Marshall Faulk, who's takeaway was \"That person can absolutely be your next head coach.\" \n— Joe Curley (@vcsjoecurley) January 13, 2017 \nFaulk didn’t originally believe a young quarterback would be a good fit for the Rams until he met McVay. \nFor more on Faulk’s reaction to McVay, listen to him speak about the hire on NFL Network .
