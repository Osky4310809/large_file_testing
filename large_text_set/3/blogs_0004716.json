The tech is obviously designed to be enjoyed by passengers, not drivers, but it’s increasingly in demand, especially for families with kids who want to stay connected while on the road. \nConnected vehicles provide additional revenue streams for carmakers , so that could be the reason Chevrolet is willing to forgo more income from different pricing tiers in this instance. It should also boost that strong growth the GM-owned carmaker is already seeing in terms of demand for in-car data, which will help long-term with subsidizing the cost of a connected fleet with consumer subscriptions. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T15:31:07.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
