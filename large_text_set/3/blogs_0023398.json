Did you have a productive work meeting? Make a healthy dinner? Match your socks?\n\nIf you’re one of the researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison, or Arkansas State University-Jonesboro, you used a leaf to grow some heart tissue.\nOne of the most crucial challenges facing bioengineering is how to take a small, lab-sized piece of human tissue and grow into an actual working human organ. Even the most advanced technologies, like 3D printing, can’t replicate the branching of blood vessels that are essential for delivering oxygen and nutrients for successful tissue growth.\nIn an attempt to solve a puzzle that has stood in the way of certain medical innovations, the interdisciplinary research teams turned to nature. They took a spinach leaf and sucked the plant cells out of it. They were left with a flimsy, translucent flap — similar to a piece of skin tissue – that still had the leaf’s network of veins intact. As a bonus, this flap is made of cellulose, a completely safe, natural substance that’s already used in regenerative medicine.\nResearchers were then able to culture beating human heart cells on the leaf by placing human cells inside the spinach veins and injecting blood-like fluids into the leaf’s vasculature. Their findings will be published in the May issue of Biomaterials. \n\n“What we’re trying to do is grow cardiac muscle on these leaves which then can be profused with a blood source by the veins that are inside the leaf,” Glenn Gaudette, a professor at WPI and one of the paper’s authors, said in a video. “And so we can, in theory, sow those veins into the native arteries in the heart and produce a contractile muscle that can replace the dead tissue in the heart.”\nSimply put, they can stack a bunch of spinach leaf shells to grow new heart muscle for heart attack victims.\nFurther, using leaves in regenerative procedures provides a highly sustainable, environmentally friendly alternative to costly synthetics. The research teams have already had similar success with sweet wormwood, peanut hairy roots and parsley.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:27:46.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
