Gov. Abbott Warns Obama Treaty Could Give U.N. Authority to Regulate Guns in America \nThe women reportedly appeared somewhat confused and apprehensive, likely because of the vast amount of uncertainty regarding their future in the country, given the expected about-face U.S. immigration policies likely will see once the administration of President-elect Donald Trump takes over from the decidedly lax enforcement of the laws as seen under the Obama administration. \nThe illegal immigrant women were most likely “released on their own recognizance” by the ICE agents with a promise to appear in an immigration court at a later date. Unfortunately, an estimated 92 percent of illegal migrants released in such a manner never actually show up for their scheduled court appearances, according to conservative commentator Dennis Michael Lynch . \nJudging by the comments on the local media post, citizens are nothing short of outraged by the treatment the Obama administration is giving individuals in the country illegally.   \nThat outrage was echoed by Border Patrol agent Hector Garza, according to Breitbart , and he revealed that what was witnessed in Laredo is actually nothing new at all, but a continuation of the current president’s policies. \n“President Obama has rolled out the red carpet for illegal immigrants,” said Garza, president of the Local 2455 of the National Border Patrol Council. “Most of the illegal immigrant families and unaccompanied children used to cross in the Rio Grande Valley. Now we are seeing massive numbers in the Laredo sector as well.” \n“Our agents frequently put their lives at risk to apprehend these illegal border crossers and stop the flow of drugs,” he continued. “Despite the risks taken to make these apprehensions, the Obama administration simply lets them go. It wears on our agents’ morale. We want to do our job and protect this country.” \n“Now we are learning that many of the immigrants processed by ICE are simply released on their own recognizance with a promise to appear for an immigration hearing at some future date,” added Garza.
