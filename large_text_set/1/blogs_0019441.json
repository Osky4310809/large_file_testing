Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports \nFOXBORO, Mass. — New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick earned multiple mentions from President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday during a dinner for campaign donors. \nTrump said Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who was in attendance, is under no pressure because he has a great quarterback in Tom Brady and a great head coach in Belichick. Trump also said he learned his work ethic through Belichick. \nBelichick, who wrote a letter to Trump before the 2016 presidential election, was asked Friday morning about being mentioned by Trump. \n“I mean really just — we have a big game,” Belichick said. \nIt's no surprise Belichick has a singular focus on the Pittsburgh Steelers with the AFC Championship Game two days away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T21:59:22.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
