Defoe is the second highest English scorer in the top flight behind Harry Kane (Photo: Getty) \nDefoe has made 55 appearances for his country and says he would love the chance to play at another major tournament - but knows he needs to be playing in the Premier League if he is to achieve that goal. \nDefoe said: \"Obviously you have to be realistic and to get into any squad it is based on merit and you need to be playing at the top level. \n\"When I went to Toronto (in MLS in early 2014) I missed out on going to the World Cup and it was a hard call to take. I would say I probably need to be playing in the Premier League but we will see what happens. \n\"The boys I'm competing against are playing in the Premier League and playing in Europe and probably that's why I missed out on the last World Cup. You probably need to be playing in the Premier League. Gareth Southgate has been impressed with Defoe's form this season (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n\"I've been blessed to have gone to two major tournaments Like I said, just never giving up really, just always keeping my head down, working hard and just having that hope that I'll get back in. I'm back here and I'm delighted. I know how important it is to play for your country. \n\"Just going to a major tournament, travelling, getting to the hotels, playing the games - it's something you've always wanted to do from being a kid, growing up watching the great players over the years. Playing in the major tournaments, going out and emulating the players you've seen on TV. \n\"Being lucky enough to have experienced it, you just want it more and more. So for me, if I do get an opportunity to go to another major tournament, it'd be a dream.‚Äù Defoe's last England appearance came against Chile back in 2013 (Photo: The FA via Getty) \nSunderland remain rooted to the foot of the table, but Defoe has still been able to show his quality and his 14 goals makes him the second highest English scorer in the top flight behind Harry Kane. \nDefoe is now hoping his recall to the England squad will help get his Sunderland team-mates off his back as he has refused to change the flag on his boots! \nHe added: \"I was getting a lot of stick from the lads at the training ground because I've still got the England flag on my boots.
