Nor do they end up on trolleys for 12 hours. \nBut vets are paid for their services by their customers.

Charges for spectacles and dentures were introduced in 1951, and for eye tests in 1988. \nMany patients pay for prescriptions and for a visit to the dentist. \nCan it be right then that a billionaire can see a GP for free when each appointment costs taxpayers £45? \nAs the population ages, social care must go hand in hand with health care. \nBut Philip Hammond has been embarrassed into ­abandoning a death tax to pay for it.

That would free up £40billion. \nOr we could find that £40billion by paying more tax. A 7p in the £ increase across all rates should do it. \nSeven out of 10 people in a Mirror poll said they were prepared to pay more if they knew the money would go to the NHS. Yet politicians also think that if they campaign for higher taxes they will not get elected. \nPerhaps they are reading us wrong. Perhaps the time for an NHS tax has come. \nOne thing is certain. If we truly value our NHS, we are – one way or another – going to have to pay more for it.
