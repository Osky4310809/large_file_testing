It was later, in the 19th century, that marmalade became a breakfast tradition in the UK. Experts put marmalade's fading appeal down to its old-fashioned image and Millennials distaste for \"bits\" in spreads. \nUntil 2001 Robertson's popular \"Golden Shred\" marmalade carried a Gollywog symbol, which it eventually scrapped over criticism that it was dated and racist.

Peanut butter, which is now seen as a \"health food\", was the fastest rising spread in terms of sales this year, with an 18.9pc yearly rise. \nGrenville Wall, consumer insight director at Kantar Worldpanel, said: “Consumers tend to carry their habits with them as they age, so those who grew up eating marmalade in its heyday still do so in their 60s and 70s. It also has a relatively unfashionable image and many people don't like the hard bits of rind.\" \nBut the older population of tomorrow was brought up on chocolate spread and peanut butter instead, so as our current generation of marmalade-eaters dies they aren’t being replaced at the same rate.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:59:37.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
