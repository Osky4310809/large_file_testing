We're already on it! https://t.co/qAeIZTn6dh \n— Aaron Sidwell (@aaronsidwell) March 21, 2017 \n\nThis is where the faith in social media and humankind is restored – while social media has some harmful aspects, this is proof that it can be used for good and if it leads to Chloe’s dreams coming true, those behind and contributing to the campaign should be really proud.\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Denise Fox’s storyline leads to another surprise character return \nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Will Lauren Branning cheat – and can Josh actually be trusted?
