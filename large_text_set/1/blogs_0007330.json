Just to clear the air i \"Terence Crawford \" never asked for 7mill to fight @mannypacquiao there was no conversation of me even fighting him \n— Terence Crawford (@budcrawford402) January 7, 2017 \nArum, for his part, said Crawford is telling the truth. Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \n“I called Freddie up a few weeks ago because we wanted to talk to him about Crawford as a possible opponent. And that’s all we talked about. And he said, ‘Tough fight, but Manny would be OK with it,” the veteran promoter told boxingscene.com. \n“I never mentioned anything to Freddie about what Crawford wanted. We never even presented the fight to Crawford. Crawford didn’t ask me for five cents. We never talked about it,” Arum added. \nThere has been clamor among boxing fans for a fight between Pacquiao and Crawford, who is seen as the next Top Rank superstar. Pacquiao earlier said he will fight the undefeated boxer for a guarantee of $20 million. \nIn doing so, it is Pacquiao who may have priced himself out, especially since Arum plans to air the Filipino’s next fight on free television and not on pay-per-view. \nArum is reportedly eyeing an April 22 date for Pacquiao’s ring return, which could be staged outside the United States. Australia is a possibility, and Brisbane-based prospect Jeff Horn is a likely candidate. \nThis would leave Crawford out of the picture for now, and Arum said a Pacquiao-Crawford showdown could happen at the end of the year instead. \nAnd as far as Arum is concerned, Crawford hasn’t asked anything to face Pacquiao. \n“Nobody talked to Crawford about money, so the idea that Crawford somehow priced himself out of the fight is total [expletive]. I mean, it’s just unfair to Crawford. We have never negotiated with Crawford on a Pacquiao fight,” explained Arum. \n“If that [Pacquiao-Crawford] fight happens, like I said, it will happen later in the year. So it’s just not accurate and it’s unfair to Crawford.” Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T12:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T09:36:15.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
