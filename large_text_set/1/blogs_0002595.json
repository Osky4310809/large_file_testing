We’ve got a bit of a hill to climb, and the games at hand are a bit of an issue, so we’ve got to take care of business, starting tonight.” \nSweeney also was asked about a Boston Globe article in which Fluto Shinzawa reported the GM is not ruling out a head-coaching change. However, Sweeney believes his comments were taken out of context. \n“I had a long conversation with Fluto (Shinzawa) today, and in my opinion, I think he stretched where the conversation was going,” he said. “He did ask me specifically whether or not I’d be ruling out a coaching change, and I was referencing where I thought our team was and the overall team performance and how we were doing. Basically talking about the personnel, and those decisions rest with me. I also discussed in terms of the plan that we had put in place when I took the job and Claude (Julien) was very firmly a part of that, and I have faith in him and our staff and our personnel.” \nStill, Sweeney made it clear that if the team continues to struggle, changes could be imminent. \n“This is a performance business,” he said. “I reference myself in that respect, and if the plan doesn’t go accordingly, I suspect changes would continue to occur. But as I’ve always stated, Claude has been a part of what we’ve been trying to accomplish here, and they’re working hard for us to continue to have success.” \nThumbnail photo via Ron Chenoy/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T14:09:44.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
