Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJamie Carragher called Leicester City's decision to sack Claudio Ranieri an \"absolute joke\" - and he wasn't alone in voicing his anger on Twitter. \nIt was only nine months ago the Italian guided the Foxes to their first Premier League title, but things have been a little different this season. \nLeicester find themselves one point off the drop zone and a relegation battle in the business end of the season looks very likely. \nStill, the decision is rather shocking when you consider the fact Ranieri achieved the impossible less than a year ago. \nUnsurprisingly, football pundits and celebrities have taken to Twitter to have their say - and, well, not many of them are happy. Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Leicester City boss (Photo: Gareth Copley) \nFoxes fan Gary Lineker, who presented Match of the Day in his underwear after Leicester clinched the title, echoed Carragher's frustration. \nHe wrote: \"After all that Claudio Ranieri has done for Leicester City, to sack him now is inexplicable, unforgivable and gut-wrenchingly sad.\" \nJames Corden also had something to say on the sacking, calling the decision an \"outrage\", while Rodney Marsh and Jake Humphrey pointed out the fact the boss had been given a vote of confidence only last week. \nLeicester City released a statement confirming the Italian was no longer in charge of the club. \nVice Chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said: \"This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since King Power took ownership of Leicester City. \n\"But we are duty-bound to put the Club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be. \n\"Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office. His skillful management, powers of motivation and measured approach have been reflective of the rich experience we always knew he would bring to Leicester City. \n\"His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the Club and develop its profile on a global scale. \n\"We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve. \n\"It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. \n\"Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign. \n\"But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:58:41.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
