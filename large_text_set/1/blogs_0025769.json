A woman's first-hand account of husband's attempt to kill her \n\"What that involves is some physical kennels at our shelters, as well as ... working on relationships with domestic violence and mental health and homelessness support agencies,\" Mr Ferguson said. \n\"What we have at the moment is quite small-scale — we care for the pets of around 150 families,\" he said. \nHe said the organisation was also trying to establish a foster care program for short and indefinite accommodation of pets. \n\"We are looking at potentially setting up a program where people who have been through a difficult situation in their life can actually care for the animal of someone who is going through a similar situation,\" Mr Ferguson said. \n\"Someone who has escaped a domestic violence situation, for example, might take in the dog of a woman or a family who are looking to escape that same situation.\" \nThe genesis of establishing a formal program came after the RSPCA began noticing a need in the community for the service. \n\"We had been running this program on an ad hoc basis for a number of years,\" Mr Ferguson said. \n\"We have seen the need in the community is quite large for this service.\" Connecting animal abuse and domestic violence \nAccording to Mr Ferguson, studies from Australia and across the world have linked animal abuse and domestic violence. \n\"We have people who are working very closely with domestic violence support agencies, and looking into some of the research that's been done,\" Mr Ferguson said. \n\"There is substantial evidence that exists worldwide — not just here in South Australia — documenting the connection between animal abuse and domestic violence.\" \nHe said the research has found abuse of pets often occurred before and during human abuse in a domestic violence situation. \n\"Sadly, a major reason for the abuse of pets by perpetrators is to control women and children,\" Mr Ferguson said. \n\"It is a really horrible situation that these people find themselves in. They have a pet and the pet is being used in a manipulative way, and they need to get themselves and their pet out.\" \nWould having domestic violence shelters for animals make a difference? \n\"It would make a huge difference,\" Ms Smith said. \n\"It would provide so much more support for women leaving, it wouldn't provide a barrier for her seeking safety, and it would just make things a whole lot easier.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:51:11.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
