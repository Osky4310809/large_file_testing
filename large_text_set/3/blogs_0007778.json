(The bad news is that there’s no actual booze in it, so don’t get any ideas, you lush.) \nAccording to Starbucks’ official website , the new blend, which is called Starbucks Reserve Whiskey Barrel Aged Sulawesi, will be available in Seattle for a limited time and is made from an 800-pound batch of green (un-roasted) coffee beans that are then scooped into empty “American Oak-aged whiskey barrels.” They’re then hand-rotated for several weeks to ensure that all the beans come into contact with the oak. Lastly, they’re roasted by Starbucks master roasters. The roasting process is what burns off all the alcohol, though the beans still retain the whiskey flavor and aroma.
