There's all those things that are on the net, the four famous chords. \n\"You've got these songs that have the same four chords, E, C, G, A or whatever they are, they all make up the same song. It's mind blowing when you look at how many of the songs are made up of the same chords.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T13:13:02.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
