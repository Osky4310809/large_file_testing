In News by Nwafor Polycarp Comments \nBy Chimaobi Nwaiwu \nNnewi—The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB and its Directorate of States, DOS, have accused the British Government of being selective in their fight against human rights abuses, upholding the rights and dignity of the indigenous people and upholding decency in the standard of human treatment, particularly as it concern Biafrans. \nIPOB in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary Mr. Emma Powerful, berated the British Government for not being vocal in condemning the ill treatment the Nigerian Government under President Muhammadu Buhari has meted out on the Biafran agitators and other freedom agitators in Nigeria. \n“IPOB finds it appalling that a supposedly civilized country such as Britain, at the forefront of upholding standards in human decency, could exhibit so much bias when it comes to the issue of upholding the rights and dignity of the indigenous populations particularly the Biafra agitators. \n“Such overt expression of hatred by the civilized British Government leaves much to be desired, if we consider the media and public uproar that greeted the news of the Tianamen Square massacre and mass arrest of pro-democracy activists in China.” Members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, at St Peter’s Square Rome, during their visit to Pope Francis at theVatican. \nIPOB alleged that Britain was vocal in pointing out the human rights limitations of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility for Islamic terrorists, but has made a volte face in condemning human rights abuses against IPOB members and Biafra agitators, describing the situation as quite an unfortunate for a country such as Britain. \nThe self determination group, described as shocking, the British Government alleged persistent refused to openly condemn the frequent alleged public slaughter of countless innocent IPOB members by the Nigerian Army, because they allegedly are the suppliers of such destructive weapons used against IPOB and other Biafra agitators. \nIt wonder the difference between pro-democracy demonstrators in China and IPOB activists asking for a democratic Biafra, adding “There is something morally repugnant about a supposedly civilized first world country such as Britain keeping mute in the face of such state sponsored barbarism and brutality by the Nigerian Government. \n“We wonder the reasons why British Government developed such pathological hatred for everything Biafra, we also wonder the crime IPOB committed and make bold to say that if we are guilty for asking for Biafra restoration, British Government is also guilty for BREXIT because we are all asking for self determination, the same way SNP in Scotland and Sein Fein in Northern Ireland is demanding for self rule.” Nwafor
