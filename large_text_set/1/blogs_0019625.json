Trump is still the President of all 50 states,” she said. “I don’t know what they were meaning to accomplish and what they were meaning to do.” \nShe also described some of the people that she encountered in D.C. to be “militant, abrasive and aggressive.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T09:27:12.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
