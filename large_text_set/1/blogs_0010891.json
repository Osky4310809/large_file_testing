We know!!). This is as cold as it gets in Mumbai and, trust us, owning to our pretty sucky winter tolerance we think this is freezing cold! Now that the weather Gods have blessed our permanently humid and hot city with some chills, here's everything we all are busy doing. 1. Frantically looking for sweaters. It's COLD! 2. We also just realised that we don't own even one decent sweater. Time to head to Zara and H&M (we finally got it too) for winter wear. 3. End up with these massive coats that we can't wear anywhere in Mumbai... ever. 4. Head over to Linking Road, and buy shrugs. Cotton shrugs are more than enough for 19-degree weather. 5. We also brought out the boots. We can finally wear them. 6. Of course boots in Mumbai are like the worse idea ever... but we manage to pair them with a short LBD, and a SHRUG. 7. â€˜Wow it's so chilly man,' is a conversation starter... every damn day. 8. We shiver each time we even get a call from Delhi. We freeze in 19 degrees... how do you guys even do it? 9. We finally have an excuse to drink three cups of hot chocolate daily. 10. #WinterIsHere... get ready to see this hashtag on everything we post, for the next two months. Heck, we'll even work it up in conversations.
