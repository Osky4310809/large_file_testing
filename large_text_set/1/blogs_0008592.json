But he has commuted the sentences of 1176 criminals - far more than any modern president. And given his talk about criminal justice reform and the idea that there are too many people of color in prison, the possibility exists that he will set a blow away the record for clemency shown to felons.\nAssociated Press:\nAmong them is Bowe Bergdahl, a US Army sergeant held captive for five years by the Taliban before his release in a prisoner swap, who is due to be court-martialed for desertion.\nLeonard Peltier, a Native American activist convicted for the 1975 deaths of two FBI agents in what his supporters say was a setup, is also hoping to enjoy Obama's good graces.\nThen there's Edward Snowden, who made the shattering revelation in 2013 of a global communications and internet surveillance system set up by the United States.\nThe 33-year-old, a refugee in Russia, is backed by numerous celebrities like actress Susan Sarandon and singer Peter Gabriel, as well as Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union.\nIf Obama fails to pardon Snowden, his supporters say he may face the death penalty under the incoming administration of Republican Donald Trump, who has called him a \"terrible traitor.\"\nIn another leak case, Chelsea Manning is serving a 35-year sentence in solitary confinement for handing 700,000 sensitive military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks, some of them classified.\nActivists say her sentence is excessive and point to the psychological frailty of the transgender soldier who has already made two suicide attempts.\nEven though the White House has dismissed a possible pardon for Snowden and Manning, their supporters are still hoping for a final magnanimous gesture from a president about to leave the constraints of his high office on January 20.\nBut both cases present unique challenges: Snowden has yet to be sentenced and merely faces espionage charges in the US, while Manning has an appeal pending before military court.\nThe US Constitution allows a president to pardon \"offenses against the United States\" and commute -- either shorten or end -- federal sentences.\nObama has so far granted 148 pardons since taking office in 2009 -- fewer than his predecessors, who also served two terms, George W. Bush (189) and Bill Clinton (396).\nBut he has surpassed any other president in the number of commutations, 1,176.\nMost of those who benefited from the president's clemency were minor drug dealers no longer considered a threat.\nObama has promised to use his clemency powers to help serve penal justice, rather than to grant special favors.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/08/get-ready-for-a-tidal-wave-of-presidential-pardons/\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.yahoo.com/news/obama-set-pardon-frenzy-leaves-office-055925757.html"], "published": "2017-01-08T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:32:40.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
