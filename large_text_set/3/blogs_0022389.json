Now, the site has taken action to ensure that its many bloggers aren’t caught up in the same kind of censorship punishment. \nNatural News has launched NaturalNewsBlogs.com , a standalone site that provides a free-speech platform for writers and bloggers who are interested in a variety of topics, including natural and alternative health, fitness, organic food, politics, science and technology, and other topics of interest to a wide range of readers. \n“The site strongly criticizes drugs-and-surgery medicine, vaccines, corporate corruption, animal testing, the use of humans for medical experiments, the chemical contamination of foods, heavy metals in consumer products, factory farming and government corruption. If you want to write on a topic we don’t yet have in our system, we can add it,” says site creator, Mike Adams , the Health Ranger and founder of Natural News. (RELATED: See all the news that the mainstream media wants to hide from you at MediaFactWatch.com ) \nThe site receives a tremendous amount of publicity from the NaturalNews.com home page, as well as a daily email newsletter, posts on social media like Facebook, Share.NaturalNews.com, Google Plus and others. Posts are evaluated daily by the Natural News editorial staff, and the ones believed to be particularly valuable to the home site readers are featured in the daily newsletter, giving authors and bloggers additional exposure to hundreds of thousands of active readers. \nAnd while there are no special requirements or restrictions to the number of blogs you can post, there is a minimum word requirement of 350. \nMaking NaturalNewsBlogs.com its own standalone site became necessary after Natural News was temporarily censored recently by Google. For several days, none of Natural News’ 140,000-plus stories were accessible through a standard Google search. The reason supplied was that a few blog posts contained forbidden advertising, though they were a few years old, and only found on the blogs subdomain, not the NaturalNews.com root domain. \nAs Adams noted when Google restored Natural News to its search algorithm: \nFor the record, there was never any allegation or evidence that Natural News had intentionally violated Google’s webmaster guidelines. While Google said we were being flagged for a so-called “sneaky mobile redirect” on a very small number of pages in a subdomain (blogs.naturalnews.com) which were created by outside bloggers, Google went to the extraordinary step of banning the entire NaturalNews.com root domain and all its subdomains — a step that would never have been applied to CNN, Huffington Post or other popular news websites. In fact, a Natural News investigation showed that violations identified involving websites like HuffPo, Forbes and CNN did not result in the same kind of blacklisting that was applied to Natural News. \nFurthermore, while Google did make an effort to provide us with one URL that they said flagged this mobile redirect, to date there hasn’t been a single SEO expert or engineer who could reproduce the supposed redirect issue. \nIn other words, the action seemed very arbitrary at the time, and still seems that way.
