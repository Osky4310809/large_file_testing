Credit Robert Hanashiro/USA Today Sports, via Reuters LOS ANGELES — When Manager Jim Leyland walked into a news conference several hours before the start of the World Baseball Classic championship, a twinkle emerged in his eye and a slight crease formed at his mouth.\n“We’re trying to make America great again,” Leyland said as he took his seat.\nIt was rare sign that the United States might be having as much fun as everyone else in this tournament, given how soberly the players have carried themselves in a festive, flag-waving, bat-flipping fortnight of international baseball.\nAs it turned out, the Americans were just saving their fun for last, claiming their first W.B.C. title with an 8-0 rout of Puerto Rico on Wednesday night before a raucous crowd of 51,565 at Dodger Stadium.\nThe United States rode six no-hit innings from pitcher Marcus Stroman, while Ian Kinsler sparked the offense with a two-run homer, a single and two runs scored in trouncing a Puerto Rico team that had been unbeaten in the tournament entering Wednesday’s game.\n  Advertisement\n  The United States, which had advanced to the semifinals once in the three previous tournaments, had a shaky start to this tournament. The Americans needed extra innings to beat Colombia, squandered a 5-0 lead against the Dominican Republic in Miami and lost to Puerto Rico in the second round in San Diego.\nPhoto Ian Kinsler after hitting a two-run home run during the third inning. He also had a single in the victory. Credit Kelvin Kuo/USA Today Sports, via Reuters Since that defeat, they have won three consecutive elimination games, beating the Dominican Republic, Japan and Puerto Rico.\n“I don’t want to bore you, but my theme all along has been ‘Make a memory, fellas,’” Leyland said.\nAdvertisement\n  They have made plenty lately. The pitchers allowed just two runs in the last 26 innings of the tournament, and Stroman was the latest starter to turn in a superb effort.\nAdvertisement\n  Kinsler, who created a stir on social media earlier in the day when his comments about the different styles of play in the tournament were interpreted by some on social media as a criticism of Latino players, hit a two-run homer off Seth Lugo in the third inning. He singled and scored on Christian Yelich’s single in the fifth, which put the United States ahead, 3-0, and chased Lugo, the Mets right-hander.\nAndrew McCutchen’s infield single later in the inning gave the United States a 4-0 lead. When Brandon Crawford hit a bases-loaded, two-out, full-count single in the seventh, it ended any suspense. The spirited Puerto Ricans never had any reason to get energized.\nPhoto Marcus Stroman after an out during the fifth inning. Credit Jae C. Hong/Associated Press Advertisement\n  It was a redemptive performance for Stroman, who gave up hits to the first six batters he faced in a 6-5 loss to Puerto Rico last week in San Diego. He was named the tournament’s Most Valuable Player after the final.\nA diminutive right-hander with a fiery personality, Stroman was eligible to pitch for Puerto Rico, where his mother was born. He and his mother had been taunted on social media since he declared in December that he would pitch for the United States. (After the 2013 tournament, he expressed hope that he could represent Puerto Rico in this year’s tournament.)\nAdvertisement\n  Stroman, who feeds off emotion, was in command all night. He had a no-hitter until Angel Pagan lined a double into the left-field corner to lead off the seventh. He then left to a standing ovation, pounding his chest emphatically as he reached the dugout steps.\nStroman allowed only one other baserunner, walking Carlos Beltran to begin the second. But he was quickly erased when Yadier Molina grounded into a double play. Only four Puerto Rico hitters hit the ball out of the infield. And when Stroman struck out Carlos Correa to end the fourth, he barked toward the Puerto Rican dugout as he strutted off the mound.\nAdvertisement\n  Such displays of emotion — whether spurred by competitive juices or exuberance — have been rare for the United States players, who have bristled at suggestions that players from the Caribbean or Asia, with their attendant bat flips and celebrations for a fine play, were having more fun in this tournament.\nSign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Just because we’re not trying to keep up with somebody else on the enthusiasm gauge, that’s not really important. Our team is as excited as any team in this.”\nAdvertisement\n  While Puerto Rican players have talked frequently about how they are playing for the people back home, where the country is mired in an economic crisis, the Americans bond has been developed over the course of the tournament.\nWhile many of the United States players knew each other, it was in the casual manner of baseball relationships: chitchat during batting practice or standing around on the bases. Players from many other countries had connections that ran far deeper, some back to youth baseball or through the shared experience of making it off the island.\nBut as their time together progressed, from when they reported to Fort Myers, Fla., to games in Miami, San Diego and then here, the bond between the Americans deepened. Some of it was forged in the cozy auxiliary clubhouses they were forced to share while they waited for another team to clear out of the main clubhouse.\n“We’ve all played against each other, we all have relationships in someway,” reliever Tyler Clippard said. “We all respect the heck out of each other. That’s what brings us together so quick.”\nFor Leyland, the tournament has been one of his best experiences — and one of his worst. He has been constantly on the phone with managers, getting prescribed pitch counts and explaining why some players have rarely played. To that end, he enlisted the little-used Josh Harrison and Alex Bregman to represent the United States in a flag ceremony before the game.\nAdvertisement\n  It was one way to ensure all the American players had a memory — on a night when they collected one together.\n  We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
