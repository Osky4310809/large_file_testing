(Photo: Getty Images) More What’s a presidential speech without a sexist joke? On Friday, after touring the Boeing aerospace plant in North Charleston, S.C., President Trump underscored his vision for the economy with a scathing insinuation about women. “That plane, as beautiful as it looks, is 30 years old,” he said, referring to the presidential plane, Air Force One, which was parked next to Boeing’s brand-new 787-10 Dreamliner. “Can you believe it? What can look so beautiful at 30?” Then, pausing for what can only be assumed was a punch line, he added, “An airplane.” After gesturing between the two aircraft, Trump added, “I don’t know — which one do we like better, folks? Tell me.” The president didn’t comment on his plane’s chubby wings or hideous engines, or slut-shame the old aircraft for hitting 56 countries and 49 states during the Obama administration . And he neglected to rank the plane on his infamous beauty scale (on which Charlize Theron is a “solid 7,” and Halle Berry “from the mid-section to the shoulders” is an 8). The comments suggest that at age 46, Melania Trump is downright elderly by her 70-year-old husband’s standards and was overdue for embalming when she married the now-president at age 34.

Still, the union makes perfect sense according to the Social Exchange Theory , which is defined by social psychologists as an “exchange of social and material resources.” The idea is that two people form a relationship based on how well they stand to benefit from it. Each has its own strengths — one might have wealth, power, a reality television show, and a Twitter dependency; the other, youth , beauty, and a steely resolve. The rewards of the relationship outweigh the costs, which allow both people to live happily ever after. The president’s comments came one day after a news conference in which he curiously referred to his wife as “the highest quality that you’ll ever find.” Read More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:23:00.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
