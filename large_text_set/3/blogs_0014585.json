But the killing of EMT Yadira Arroyo — mowed down by a madman in her own stolen ambulance — is a horrific reminder that all who protect this city can face enormous risks.\nArroyo, 44 and a mother of five, had no qualms about that. She loved her job and took enormous pride in the work — “to protect and to serve,” she told her sister-in-law — she did so ably for 14 years.\nShe was trying to do that job Thursday, responding with her partner to an emergency call in The Bronx, when a passing motorist shouted that someone was joyriding on their vehicle’s rear bumper.\nAfter Arroyo and partner Monique Williams got out to confront him, the man jumped in and started driving off, then backed up and ran over her, inflicting fatal injuries.\nAt age 25, suspect Jose Gonzalez has amassed a long rap sheet of 31 arrests — the most recent just three weeks ago. It ranges from violent crimes like assault and weapons possession to the kind of quality-of-life crimes, including turnstile jumping, that the city has recently decriminalized.\nHe also reportedly has a long history of mental illness and has been treated as an emotionally disturbed person in several police calls. And he was living in state-funded supportive housing — which suggests those facilities are no magic cure-all.\nNeighbors had time and again flagged him to authorities as a nuisance or threat. So the case is fresh proof that the city’s vast social-services network isn’t doing enough to protect society.\nBut the focus should remain on Yadira Arroyo, two of whose kids plan to follow in her heroic footsteps and become EMTs. Their pride in their mother’s selfless career and their pain over her needless death are shared by all New Yorkers.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:44:40.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
