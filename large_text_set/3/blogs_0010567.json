In what’s a seriously awesome step towards breaking down these gender barriers, though, Pharrell will star in Chanel’s new handbag campaign — making him the elite brand’s first male handbag model ever .\nPharrell has been a longtime member of the Chanel family , walking in a fashion show last year and sitting front row at the brand’s recent presentation at Paris Fashion Week.\nChanel Pharrell \nA post shared by Pharrell Williams (@pharrell) on Mar 7, 2017 at 6:08am PST \nIn an interview with Women’s Wear Daily this week, Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld expressed his affection for Pharrell and explained that the bag he’ll be modeling is “not very feminine in the sense of being chici,” so don’t expect to see Pharrell carrying a gem-encrusted clutch.\nWhat you will see in the new campaign — due to launch April 3rd — is Pharrell rocking a crocodile version of Chanel’s new Gabrielle bag, which is inspired by virtual-reality goggles. The campaign also features other brand ambassadors Kristen Stewart, Cara Delevingne, and Caroline de Maigret. So, basically, we’re ridiculously psyched to see what’ll surely be an amazing (and star-studded!) ad.\n@caradelevingne @pharrell #CHANELGroundControl #CHANELFallWinter #PFW \nA post shared by CHANEL (@chanelofficial) on Mar 7, 2017 at 9:27am PST \nThough it’s crazy to think that, in 2017, we’re still overly concerned with a man carrying a handbag, Chanel has already begun to push back at those gender norms. At its recent Paris show , for example, none other than Lagerfeld’s own 8-year-old godson, Hudson Kroenig , carried a version of the Gabrielle bag down the runway — so Pharrell will be following in solid footsteps.\n\nA post shared by Hudson Kroenig (@hk0712) on Mar 8, 2017 at 1:43am PST \nPlus, the singer clearly isn’t bothered and is loving the Gabrielle bag in his personal life.\n“When I first started wearing [the Gabrielle] I didn’t have anything in it. I was just so excited to have it,” the “Happy” singer told WWD. “But now I use it to carry my phone, and — you know — essential personal things.” As any purse-wearer, male or female, is aware, handbags are super convenient. And why shouldn’t guys be allowed the convenience of a bag, simply because of outdated and invented gender norms? Hopefully, Pharrell’s appearance in the new Chanel ads will be a first step toward the end of that stereotype.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:52:09.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
