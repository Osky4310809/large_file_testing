On Saturday the WAEC will begin doing the full distribution of preferences for each seat. They intend to do around ten per day to finish the process by the end of next week. \nIn this process there are usually some minor changes to the first preference tallies by candidate owing to extra informal votes being located. These changes are reported in the electronic feed, but the final two-candidate preferred counts from the distribution of preferences are not included. \nAs the ABC's computer system can't have automatic and manual updates at the same time, the use of the feed is being abandoned and final figures for each electorate will be manually entered after the distribution of preferences is published. \nIn the Legislative Council, the WAEC is currently data entering all ballot papers completed below the line. However, totals for these ballot papers are not included in the data feed. All that the ABC and the WAEC website report are tallies of above-the-line votes by group. \nThis has implications for reading the Legislative Council calculator output. Historically minor parties, especially the Greens, have higher rates of below-the-line voting. Major parties have lower rates of below the line voting. This means that once below-the-line totals are included in the count, the percentage vote for major parties will dip slightly, while percentage votes for minor and micro parties will rise slightly. \nThis final percentages by party will not be available before the formal distribution of preferences takes place for each region on Wednesday or Thursday next week. \nThe two results produced by the calculator that are most likely to be impacted by the inclusion of below the line votes are the races for final seats in South Metropolitan and South West Regions. \nIn South Metropolitan the Green percentage vote will rise and Labor and Liberal percentage vote decline, making it more likely that the Greens will defeat the Liberals in the race for the final seat. \nIn South West Region the final seat is a close race between Labor and the Greens, and the increase in Green vote produced by the inclusion of below the line votes makes it more likely that the Greens will defeat Labor in the race for the final seat. \nI'l try to report the final counts for lower house seats as declared.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T10:50:26.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
