I literally cannot even understand it. It's such far-out concept that I don't want to believe that actually is happening. It's insane.\" \nWhen asked how Trump's tweets in 2012 made her feel at the time, Kristen replied, \"At that point, he was just, like, a reality star. I had no reference. It wasn't like really a thing. But in retrospect, somebody reminded me of that and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, you're right!' \n\"He's probably, like, going to tweet about this.\" \nWhen asked if she has a message for other young women, with a laugh, Kristen told Variety, \"Ladies, stand up for yourself!\" \nTurning to a more serious note, she continued, \"I've never been the most politically charged person, but I think at this point, it's not political. It's f**king so humanitarian.\" Kristen Stewart and stella maxwell dating Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson \"Twilight Saga: Eclipse\" Read More Kim Kardashian says farewell to Barack Obama with family photos of North meeting the former President \nShe added, \"I would just say be a part of what you believe in, whichever way that is.
