The unnamed manager who allegedly groped the female employees was later fired, the report said. \nFormer employees told the Times that they notified Uber's senior leadership, including CTO Thuan Pham and CEO Travis Kalanick, of workplace harassment. However, Uber had an \"A-Team\" of people close to Kalanick who avoided scrutiny from HR, according to the Times. \nUber did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. \nIn the days since Fowler's blog post went viral, Kalanick claimed he wasn't aware of Fowler's harassment allegations and pledged a full investigation into the environment, which will be lead by former US Attorney General Eric Holder. However, Wednesday's report from The New York Times suggests that the scope of the investigation might have to be much wider than originally thought.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:00:53.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
