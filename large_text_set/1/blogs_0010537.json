While Governor John Kasich vetoed the bill in favor of signing one that would ban abortions after 20 weeks, it still was seen by many as a sign of the changes that could be coming for abortion rights. \nThose concerns were validated on Friday afternoon, as Representative Steve King, a Republican from Iowa, sponsored a national version of the bill. According to King:\n“Human life, beginning at the moment of conception, is sacred in all of its forms and today, I introduced a bill that will protect the lives of voiceless innocents. My legislation will require all physicians, before conducting an abortion, to detect the heartbeat of the unborn child. If a heartbeat is detected, the baby is protected.”\nThe bill is a direct response to Roe V. Wade, which the Trump administration is looking to overturn , establishing the legal standard for abortion at 24 weeks. The Supreme Court had set that timeline for the gestational viability of a fetus, and a restrictive ban at six weeks would make it very difficult for many women to even realize that they’re pregnant in time to terminate. \nWhile it is unlikely that such a bill will be passed, it does offer a glimpse of what’s to come in the fight for women’s rights.\n(Via Jezebel )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:00:14.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
