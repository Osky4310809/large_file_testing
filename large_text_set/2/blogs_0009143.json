It’s the perfect combination of a dairy, a planner, and a to-do list , all in one compact notebook. Since discovering the concept, we’ve been all about this way of organizing our life and thoughts — but we’re still learning some of the most effective ways to use the mechanism. Case in point, t his teen has found a new way to use bullet journals and it’s actually an incredible way to track your mental health over a long period of time. Sixteen year-old Kyra Bailey told Buzzfeed that she was inspired by a post on Instagram encouraging people to “track their year in pixels.” \nKyra’s 21 year-old brother Markale stumbled across the tracker and loved the idea so he posted it on Twitter. \nWalked in my sister room and saw this pic.twitter.com/O0JbvkaI1s \n— Saint Pablo (@TheLifeOfKale) February 2, 2017 The post quickly went viral. Markale told Buzzfeed that he simply wanted to share his sister’s creativity with others but is inspired by how many people are following suit and making their own trackers. \n“It’s the best way to analyze what is going on in your life and what you should do to stay positive,” he told Buzzfeed. \n@TheLifeOfKale that's gonna be dope when the year is over\n— Peaches (@LikeBrandi) February 2, 2017 \n@TheLifeOfKale tell your sister I said thank you for the idea\n— Ty (@tythagemini) February 2, 2017 Kyra told Buzzfeed that using the tracker has made a positive impact on her life . \n“Using the tracker really helps my mental health, it makes me feel like every day I’m a new person,” she said. “This tracker has a huge impact on my everyday life – it’s a great way to keep track on how I am feeling during the week. It really helps you look back on your past years wondering how you felt through those long days you had at school or at work or just in life in general.” \nWe love how much attention this tweet has gotten. There is still an incredible stigma surrounding mental health and mental health issues so it’s so heartwarming to see people speaking out about looking out for their mental health. \nThe idea is such a colorful idea in tracking our mental health! We think it’s a fabulous idea and can’t wait to give it a try. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:21:23.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
