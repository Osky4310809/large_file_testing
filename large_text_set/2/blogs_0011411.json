Though she did hit “send” on the account’s first tweet back in late 2014, then typed out a personal message of thanks for all the well-wishes on her 90th birthday , the Head of the Commonwealth is in need of some social media help. Which is where you could come in. \nThe Evening Standard reports that the Royal Household is looking for a Digital Communications Officer to join the Queen’s “fast-paced and dynamic team,” with the primary goal of “finding new ways to maintain The Queen's presence in the public eye and on the world stage.” The ideal candidate will have keen editorial and photography skills, be flexible and proactive, and have previous experience overseeing websites and digital communications, “preferably in a high-profile environment.” In addition to tweeting on Her Majesty’s behalf, you’ll also manage her Facebook and YouTube pages, as well as her personal website. \nIn addition to an annual salary of £30,000 (about $37,500 per year), the job listing states that the chosen candidate “can look forward to a comprehensive benefits package, including a 15 percent employer contribution pension scheme (after six months), 33 days annual leave, including bank holidays, and access to training and development to support your continuous professional development.” \nIt should be noted that the job is not a permanent one; it’s a year-long position to cover a maternity leave. Which gives you 365 days to make yourself indispensable to the Royal Family, especially if you can convince The Queen to live tweet the next season of Game of Thrones .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:18:45.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
