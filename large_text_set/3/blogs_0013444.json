Ahead of the unveiling, we’ve seen quite a number of leaks and reports regarding the next Galaxy flagships. Now just a couple of days ahead of the launch, a new report has revealed key details regarding the Galaxy S8’s camera and iris scanner. \nAccording to a report by Naver , the Samsung Galaxy S8 will be able to capture 1000fps super slow-motion videos. To achieve this, Samsung has placed DRAM (used as buffer memory) into the camera sensor of the Galaxy S8 itself. This tech can transmit and store images at a much faster rate than the tech used in the Galaxy S7 . \nThe report further states that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will feature an autofocus-enabled 8-megapixel selfie shooter. In addition, it will get a 3.7-megapixel RGB camera sensor for iris scanning. The fingerprint sensor of the device will be placed alongside the rear camera, which is in line with what we saw in the recently leaked photos. \nIf the report is true, the Samsung Galaxy S8 camera will trump even the recently launched Sony Xperia XZ Premium , which is capable of recording 960fps slo-mo videos at 720p. We will find out more on March 29th, when Samsung will officially unveil the phone to the world. \nIn related news, a handful of live images of the black variant of the Samsung Galaxy S8 have surfaced on the Chinese social networking website Weibo. The images are in line with earlier leaked renders of the device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T09:25:50.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
