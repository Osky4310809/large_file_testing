Kristen Stewart Reminds Us All Of Those Weird Trump Tweets EMAIL Summit/Getty \nAh, 2012. It was a simpler time. The dab was not yet a thing, Obama was still president, and we still had a steady supply of Twilight movies to hate-watch. Also, Donald Trump was very, very invested in the relationship drama between Twilight stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson . It was… super weird. Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again–just watch. He can do much better! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2012 Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion. She will cheat again–100 certain–am I ever wrong? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2012 Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2012 So many tweets & stories on Stewart/Pattinson Look, it doesn't matter– the relationship will never be the same. It is permanently broken. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 19, 2012 Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2012 Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen.I don't have time except to say \"Robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again!\" \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2012 Miss Universe 2012 Pageant will be airing live on @nbc & @Telemundo december 19th. Open invite stands for Robert Pattinson. \n— Donald J.
