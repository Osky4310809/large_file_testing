Does not fully understand.\" Oh really, couldn't do... \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2017 much worse - just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2017 \nThis is the most direct accusation yet in the escalating feud with Obama's intelligence agencies. As we noted earlier , no president since John F. Kennedy has dared to take on the CIA or the rest of the national security establishment. They knew that if they opposed the national-security establishment at a fundamental level, they would be subjected to retaliatory measures. To the extent that President Kennedy consciously stood up to the system, he paid the price for his attempt at independent wielding of power from the Oval Office. It is a shuddering thought. A sharp lesson in history that must not be misinterpreted. The implications for Trump are quite clear. If his refusal to take intelligence briefings, or follow CIA advice is serious, then serious consequences will follow. If Trump is serious about peace with Putin when they insist on war, there will be a problem. \nThe CIA director will likely be replaced by Mr Trump's pick Mike Pompeo next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T03:50:52.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
