Trump has stated that he will support Israel , and The Washington Post noted that many Israelis think that settlements will blossom under Trump because he won’t make any moves to stop them.   \nDavid M. Friedman, Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Israel, is strongly in favor of West Bank settlements, possibly indicating how things could play out in that region, The Washington Post reported in a separate article. \nIsrael has made it clear that it really doesn’t care what the international community thinks of it. The Israelis will take actions they think are best for their people — even if the Security Council frowns on them. \nHopefully Trump will be able to bring some semblance of peace to the region — or at the very least reduce the tensions between the two sides while maintaining strong ties with Israel, a highly valued ally in the region. \nShare this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think Israel should do about the settlement issue.
