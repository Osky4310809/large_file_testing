With the usual lineup of heavy-hitting favorites like Shrimp Daddy, Amazebowls, Cheezus, and Goa Taco, the seaside version adds a few new vendors, like a Japanese dessert shop and a chai brewer. \nIn addition to the slate of food offerings, there will be a significant shopping component, for those looking to grab some mementos and crafted goods. If you’ve been hesitant to venture to Downtown on a Sunday and see what the hubbub’s been all about, this is a great chance to try some of the exact same Instagram-worthy food on the Westside.\nThe one day event commences at 11 a.m. and runs to 5 p.m. with free admission and plenty of parking available nearby in lots or at the beach. Smorgasburg’s normal Sunday schedule will resume on March 12 at ROW DTLA.\nWhy Smorgasburg Delivers on Its Big, Beautiful Promise [ELA] All Smorgasburg LA Coverage [ELA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:58:25.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
