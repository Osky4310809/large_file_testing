I’m worried for the quality of my future education and receiving of Federal Financial Aid. Their willingness to break federal law jeopardized that federal funding,” the student told TheDC. \n“Our immigration laws are in place for a reason. I believe this group of college students, who are supposed to be the voice of our student body, believe they have the ability to circumvent those laws, which they do not and should not have,” he added. \nSeveral American universities have seen similar calls for their schools to turn into sanctuary campuses in light of President Trump’s actions and promises on immigration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T06:16:10.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
