The comedian was arrested Saturday after a man alleged that Epps and one of his friends attacked him, unprovoked.\n“We kind of met right there in the middle and I recognized him,” the man told The Advocate. “I said ‘Oh, Mike Epps!'”\n“The next thing I know, he started hitting me in the face, unprovoked,” the man said. “I had a handful of chips, so I just basically bent down to protect myself, and then my friends ran over and got in front of me, and then security got there.”\nThe victim alleges that he was left bruised and bloodied during the fight.\nSo far Mike hasn’t uttered a peep about his arrest and he missed an arraignment alongside his friend Thomas Cobb, 52, who was also arrested for the brawl.\nHe’s now free as a bird and signing autographs:\n\nThis story seems a little shaky—why would Mike Epps attack a fan just for saying “hi”???\n\nIt’s worth noting however that this the second time in recent years Epps has been accused of violence. Comedienne Simone Shepherd alleged that he punched her in the face on a red carpet. \nWhat do YOU think about the Mike Epps arrest story???\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:50:01.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
