So when we heard about the Charlotte Gainsbourg for Nars Collection we had to share the news—even though details are pretty scarce at this point. According to Refinery 29 , the new collection, which launches this spring, includes 18 brand-new, limited-edition products for eyes, lips, and cheeks. Plus, rumor has it that one of the products will be totally new—as in, something Nars has never offered before.

The company’s founder and creative director, François Nars , told Refinery 29 he’d been hoping to work with Gainsbourg since meeting her on a shoot two years ago. “She’s an incredibly charming and giving person with an instinctive taste and style. I admire her for building a career with no compromise, no limits, and totally dedicating herself to it,” Nars said of the international \"It\" girl. Gainsbourg (whose mother is former Hermès muse Jane Birkin), shared similar sentiments about her collaborator. “It was very familiar working with [Francois Nars]—as if we’d known each other for a long time,” she told Refinery 29 . Since Gainsbourg was directly involved in the design process, you can expect to see products that reflect her personal beauty style—think summery blushes and dramatic, smokey shadows. The Charlotte Gainsbourg for Nars Collection launches at Nars boutiques on April 15 and Sephora stores nationwide May 1.
