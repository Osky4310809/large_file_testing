The series will start on January 7th and air every Saturday at 8 PM ET.\nThe hour-long program will expand on the segments Watters has presented on The O’Reilly Factor for years now. Essentially, these are man-on-the-street interviews done in a comedic style surrounding the issues of the day.\nBesides featuring these segments, Watters’ World will also feature a rotating panel of commentators and Watters will also be interviewing well-known guests.\nIn response to the announcement, Watters said he was “humbled that FOX News Channel has given me this opportunity. He added, “I look forward to viewers entering my world more often and wouldn’t be in this position if it weren’t for Bill.”\nWatters joined Fox News in 2002 and has been working on The O’Reilly Factor since 2003.\n[image via screengrab]\n–\nFollow Justin Baragona on Twitter: @justinbaragona\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Ffox-news-watters-world-to-expand-to-weekly-series-airing-saturday-evenings%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-05-at-4.57.28-PM.jpg&description=Fox%20News%26%238217%3B%20Watters%26%238217%3B%20World%20to%20Expand%20to%20Weekly%20Series%20Airing%20Saturday%20Evenings", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Ffox-news-watters-world-to-expand-to-weekly-series-airing-saturday-evenings%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://www.reddit.com/static/button/button3.js", "https://twitter.com/#!/justinbaragona"], "published": "2017-01-06T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:06:42.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
