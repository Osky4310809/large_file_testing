He had to learn everything before filming began.

You’re learning the steps and working with your partner,” Jones said. \nBut it’s still dangerous dancing, and not without injuries. \n“When you’re in the midst of fights your adrenaline’s so pumped you don’t think about what you’re doing to your body until you wake up the next day and think, ‘F**king hell!’” Jones said. \nHe revealed that he pulled a muscle in his groin while filming scenes, but downplayed the pain just like you’d expect a budding superhero to. \n“It comes with the territory,” Jones said. “If you’re doing two or three fights per week for six months you’re going to get some injuries.” \nJones revealed before that his character cannot yet refer to himself as a superhero, and that he has to earn the right to be called the Iron Fist. If this series is anything like Daredevil , we’ll probably see Rand get his ass kicked—and kick a bunch more asses in kind—on his way to being a full fledged Defender before he teams up with the other Netflix heroes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:15:16.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
