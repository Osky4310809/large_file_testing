Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAs women around the world prepare to draw attention to their role in the workplace, a statue of a little girl appeared in front of New York's well-known bronze charging bull. \nThe diminutive, school-age child fearlessly stares down the massive beast in a symbolic act of defiance on International Women's Day . \nThe statue was placed in front of the famous tourist attraction in Lower Manhattan by a Wall Street firm on Tuesday evening. \nState Street Global Advisors said it was a way of calling attention to the lack of gender diversity on corporate boards and the pay gap of women working in financial services.
