And with everyone's favourite young Bollywood couple, Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan, that's not a hard job. The two have been busy travelling across India to promote the movie and they just premiered the fourth song from the film, Aashiq Surrender Hua . A super cute and fun song, it shows Varun and Alia teasing each other about their love story in the film. And both the actors once again show off their dancing prowess (albeit not as much as in Tamma Tamma Again ), and look like the effortlessly happy pair they are, while doing so. Check out the fun number, here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:28:39.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
