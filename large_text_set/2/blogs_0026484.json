Read Full Article \nFor example, the New York Daily News characterized Conway as \"making herself comfortable\" on the couch in the AFP photo. \nBut as Fox News correspondent Adam Housley and others have pointed out, Conway was actually on the couch to take a cellphone snap of the group, which another photo clearly showed. Here's the photo many outlets didn't publish. It explains why Conway was sitting that way. Still can't believe we're talking about a couch pic.twitter.com/iPhyr4eF7W \n— Adam Housley (@adamhousley) February 28, 2017 \nBelow is a sampling of the liberal outrage, including from a Black Lives Matter activist, who claimed Conway was being purposefully disrespectful to the African-American university officials.

This isn't your home. https://t.co/12DpukKDkS \n— Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) February 28, 2017 Sure, Kellyanne, just make yourself right at home???? On an Oval Office couch??? With all those people there Why not???? https://t.co/D71pExU0Xr \n— lindsey marie (@thekuhlest) February 28, 2017 Judging from that pose on the couch, Kellyanne Conway has zero respect for the Oval office or for herself. https://t.co/tZCLPgVT5t \n— HinterlandG (@hinterlandg) February 28, 2017 \nAnd also there was a lot of ridicule of that outrage... If Kellyanne's feet on the Oval Office couch triggers you, imagine what that couch would be going thru if Bill Clinton was back in there.. \n— Jeremy Nolt (@RealJeremyNolt) February 28, 2017 Feminists are giving Kellyanne for not sitting 'ladylike' on a couch. Remember, these are the people who marched across DC in huge vaginas \n— Pardes Seleh (@PardesSeleh) February 28, 2017 Bill & Hillary Clinton stole the furniture from the Oval Office yet liberals freak out over Kellyanne Conway putting her feet on the couch. \nStuart Varney discussed the latest \"outrage,\" calling it a \"disgrace\" that Jimmy Kimmel and many journalists have called President Trump a racist. \nWatch the discussion with Sheriff David Clarke above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:35:07.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
