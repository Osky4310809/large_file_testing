He was called a “cheat” by Samir Nasri last week, a snake for his part in Claudio Ranieri’s downfall and admits he loves winding up opposing supporters. Vardy was blamed for getting Ranieri the sack in some quarters (Photo: Plumb Images) \n“I just get abuse at every stadium that I turn up at,” said Vardy. “To be honest, you are always going to get stick from fans. It is part and parcel of football. \n“I’m one that carries on and winds them up a bit. Do I enjoy it? Yeah, it’s just me. \n“I couldn’t tell you why I get it, but it’s part of the game. I am not really fussed about it. It’s fine by me. You’re bound to get all that stuff with it. I wouldn’t change it.” \nThe title of the Vardy movie is “Fearless” and that is exactly what he believes England will have to be in the future if they are to emulate Leicester’s underdogs success of last season. Vardy tussled with Samir Nasri in the Champions League (Photo: Getty) \nLeicester was the greatest story in Premier League history and it propelled Vardy into the England squad, even scoring a spectacular back heel when the Three Lions beat Germany 3-2 in their own backyard last March. \nSadly, that only seemed to give England false hope and expectation for the Euros, they suffered a humiliating exit to Iceland which cost Roy Hodgson his job and the players are still trying to recover. \nVardy admits that he still struggles to explain how Leicester won the title, what went wrong at the Euros and why this season turned sour before Craig Shakespeare took over last month. But one big pointer was Vardy suggesting the pressure is so much greater for England.
