Sheeran’s new album ‘÷’ (‘Divide’) isn’t far off, with the Framlingham man releasing two record-breaking singles at the start of the year and being heavily rumoured to play a headline slot at Glastonbury Festival in June, following a tour of Europe and South America. Here’s what we know about the album to date – we’ll update this page as we learn more. When is Ed Sheeran’s new album released? \nMarch 3. \nYep – it’s just under two months until ‘÷’ is released. What new Ed Sheeran songs are out? \nRight now there are just two, and both were released at once on January 6, 2017. \nOn their release he said: “Hello 2017! I’ve been working hard on the new material and I hope you can be as excited about it as I am. I really wanted to show two different sides to my music that I’m equally as passionate about and I just knew I wanted to roll with two songs at the same time. I’m absolutely buzzing to be back.” \nHere’s the rollicking nostalgia trip that is ‘Castle on the Hill’. Watch out for the falsetto whoops: \nAnd here’s the syncopated, synthy jam ‘Shape of You’: \nThis one’s a bit more of a departure for Sheeran. He has revealed he wrote it with Snow Patrol’s Johnny McDaid and pop producer Steve Mac, and that they started writing it with Rihanna in mind but never sent her the song: “I started writing lyrics like ‘putting Van the Man on the juke box’ and thought ‘she’s not really going to sing that’. We decided halfway through that this would work for me.” \nThe reaction to the new music has been extremely positive. It smashed the record for one-day Spotify streams by more than 2 million streams (the previous record holder was One Direction’s ‘Drag Me Down’, with 4,759,698 streams – ‘Shape of You’ got 6,868,642, while ‘Castle on the Hill’ got 6,168,395). \nOne Direction’s Niall Horan has since called ‘Castle on the Hill’“My kind of song… reminds me of home”, while Taylor Swift reacted to ‘Shape of You’ with the below Instagram post: A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Jan 6, 2017 at 3:55am PST Has Ed released any new videos? \nYes – two so far. \n‘Castle On The Hill’ got a video on January 23 – the nostalgic clip was shot in Sheeran’s hometown of Framlingham, Suffolk. Take it all in: \nOne week later, on January 30, ‘Shape Of You’ got the video treatment too. Ed stars as loved-up amateur boxer, there’s a Rocky -style montage sequence, and at the end he gets trounced by a sumo wrestler. It’s quite a ride. What else can we expect from the album? \nOne clue we have is that it won’t be like Justin Bieber’s ‘Love Yourself’. Confused? Well, Sheeran originally wrote ‘Love Yourself’ – which became a mega-hit for Justin Bieber – for ‘÷’. “It just wouldn’t have made it [onto ‘÷’]” he’s revealed. Either that means the new songs are way better than ‘Love Yourself’, or that they’re just very different. \nThere’s also a new song about Barcelona that Ed wrote with Foy Vance. Ed says, “I love Barcelona so I wrote a love song for Barcelona.” There’s a bit of cod-Spanish in it too, he says, telling The Sun , “It doesn’t make a lot of sense. It’s just the Spanish words I know put together. There’s one line where I say ‘Siempre Vivre La Barcelona,’ which is actually Latin I think, but it just sounded cool. It means ‘long live Barcelona.'” \nEd’s revealed he’s very ambitious with sales for ‘÷’, telling GQ : “ Adele is the one person who’s sold more records than me in the past 10 years. She’s the only person I need to sell more records than. That’s a big f***ing feat because her last album sold 20 million. But if I don’t set her as the benchmark then I’m selling myself short.” What’s the tracklist for Ed Sheeran’s new album? \n‘÷’ has 12 tracks. \nSheeran shared the tracklist on Instagram on January 11.
