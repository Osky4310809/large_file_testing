But he’s done yet. \nRegrettably, Baldwin is teaming with writer Kurt Anderson — who co-founded Spy magazine – to write a book in the fake voice of Trump. \nBaldwin told the L.A. Times that he isn’t going to do much of the writing. “I think it’s fair to say that Kurt will do most of the writing,” he said. “We have that arrangement whereby he doesn’t put on the wig, I don’t open up a Word document.” \nThe book, which is called, You Can’t Spell America Without ME: The Really Tremendous Inside Story of My Fantastic First Year as President Donald J. Trump will come out in November. No doubt Trump won’t be a fan. \n“Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me,” Donald Trump tweeted back in November. “Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!” \nWhat do you think? Will you buy this?
