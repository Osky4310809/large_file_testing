(RELATED: PROOF: Women Like Men Who Are Already Taken) \n“Results indicated that how vividly a mortality experience was recalled predicted greater authenticity and more important goal-pursuits,” the official abstract of the study reads . \nThere were 457 participants, according to PsyPost, and researchers conducted three separate studies to verify there results. \nThe lead author of the study, Elizabeth Seto of Texas A&M, undertook the project because “there is a pervasive idea that being your true, authentic self is the key to leading a happy, meaningful life” while not much is known “about the experiences that help us feel in touch with our true selves.” \nShe notes that existential philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested that authenticity is most likely rooted in the ways people contemplate death. \n“I believe that contemplations about death may seem debilitating at times, but how we think about death can be related to positive psychological outcomes,” Seto said, according to PsyPost. \nShe adds that their “research does not clarify a mechanism underlying this relationship.” But Seto does think the findings are likely significant, because it makes sense that an experience with mortality may be such an important life event that it propels “movement towards authenticity” and profoundly affects a person’s goals and aspirations.
