The JPP tag was not done before 4p today so it'll be part of tomorrow's transactions. But Pierre-Paul has been informed by NYG he's tagged. \n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) February 27, 2017 \nThe Giants have until July 15 to negotiate a long-term deal with Pierre-Paul, who signed a one-year deal with the Giants last year. Pierre-Paul, who suffered a serious injury to his right hand during a fireworks mishap, had seven sacks in just 12 games last season. \nAccording to ESPN , the Giants were concerned about slapping the tag on Pierre-Paul, fearing it would make him unhappy, but the club was convinced he would sign with another team if he hit the open market. \nThis is the second time the Giants have used the tag on Pierre-Paul, who played under those terms two years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:34:39.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
