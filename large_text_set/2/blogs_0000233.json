JUN ELIAS I will kill more – Rody \n  Reports that policemen were given incentives for every drug suspect killed would be probed as part of the cleansing process of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Malacañang said yesterday. \n“It’s part of the cleansing operation. It’s being looked into,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said. \n“Definitely the President is concerned about what’s happening and has actually responded, as you can very well see,” he added. \nAbella cited the President’s decision to suspend the PNP’s anti-illegal drug operations following the death of a South Korean businessman at the hands of the PNP Anti-Illegal Drugs Group (AIDG). \n“The President’s anti-drug war does not condone extrajudicial killings and the President is clear that he is after criminals,” Abella said. \n“Again, let me just say, criminal cops are not government. Their illegal acts do not represent the police institution whose duty is to ensure the protection and security of civilians.”   \nIn Davao City, President Duterte yesterday vowed “to kill more” if he has to rid the country of illegal drugs. \nDuterte told a gathering of water executives that he will not ease up on his fight against illegal drugs. \nThe President, however, lamented how the fight against illegal drugs has been affected by corruption in the PNP and even in the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), both lead agencies in the war on drugs. \n“I cannot trust the police, because it is corrupt, I cannot trust the NBI because it is corrupt. I have very limited warm bodies but very many wars to fight,” Duterte told the representatives of water districts all over the country in a national conference at the SMX Convention Center in Davao City. \nEarlier, Amnesty International (AI) said the PNP acted on instructions “from the very top of government” and have killed thousands of suspected drug offenders. The group said the policemen even paid others to execute the drug offenders. \nAmnesty International also accused the PNP of “systematically” targeting poor and defenseless people, planting evidence, recruiting paid killers, stealing from their victims and fabricating incident reports. \n“Under President Duterte’s rule, the national police are breaking laws they are supposed to uphold while profiting from the murder of impoverished people the government was supposed to uplift. The same streets Duterte vowed to rid of crime are now filled with bodies of people illegally killed by his own police,” the group said. \nThe policemen were incited by the rhetoric of President Duterte, who has repeatedly threatened to kill drug lords, it added. \nAbella admitted that some rogue cops may have used Duterte’s statements of support to the PNP as a cover for their wrongdoings. \n“Some of these ‘scalawags’ may have taken that as a form of cover in order to engage in those operations,” he said. \n“The President has repeatedly said that the drug apparatus has to be destroyed, that’s why he frames it in terms of war.” \nAbella also noted the Philippines has been ranked “partly free” by the Freedom in the World report, the same classification it has been in the previous years. \n“Although there was a slight dip due to human rights violations of varying scale with impunity,” he said. \nAbella said the report should have been weighed in terms of the public’s trust and satisfaction over the President’s anti-crime campaign that created a better peace and order situation in the country. \nHe said the report was partially funded by the US State Department, which is the target of Duterte’s criticisms. \nAbella said the Freedom report has partially attributed the ranking to Duterte’s policy of alleged extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers and addicts. \n“Such conclusion is really far from the truth,” he said. \nAbella reiterated Duterte’s anti-drug war does not condone extrajudicial killings and the President made it clear that he is after criminals. \n“The campaign against illegal drugs has yielded more than a million drug personalities, some of whom have already surrendered while some admit themselves to the rehab programs,” he added. Inquiry urged \nLawmakers have called for an inquiry into the reports made by Amnesty International of policemen being paid for killing suspected drug offenders. \n“These are serious allegations coming from an international body that should be looked into in order to determine if there is basis to the claims,” Sen. Francis Escudero said. \nEscudero said that the inquiry would also allow the PNP to air its side on the issue and even confront the AI on the allegations it made regarding the police. \nAccording to AI, they were informed that policemen were given an incentive of P8,000 to P12,000 for each kill they made on drug personalities. \n“If the claims are true then I will even support them (AI) but if they turn out to be false, they should not be allowed to just destroy the image of a country and then just make a retraction,” he said. \nBased on the account of AI in its report, Escudero said the PNP officials who supposedly ordered the killings could be charged with conspiracy to commit murder. \nHe added there is no legal justification for the use of public funds to finance the killing of people, so if the allegations made by AI are true, then the use of funds for the operations were definitely illegal. \nIfugao Rep. Teodoro Baguilat Jr. described the AI report as “disconcerting.” \nHe said Congress should scrutinize the allegations against the PNP. \n“The AI report validates our assertion that the tactics and strategies of this administration on the drug war are faulty. They are premised on disregard for the rule of law, due process and human rights. And this has led to police corruption and state-sponsored or condoned killing,” Baguilat said. \nSome police officials disputed the AI report. \n“The report is all allegations. It’s easy to concoct that,” said Director Oscar Albayalde, chief of the National Capital Region Police Office. \nAlbayalde though ordered an investigation to determine the veracity of the AI report. \nAlbayalde also urged the AI to bring forward their witnesses. \n“We could start our investigation into their claims as soon as possible,” he said. \nSupt. Jackie Candelario, deputy director of the Pangasinan provincial police, also took exception to the report of AI. \n“There’s nothing of that sort, that we can say as far as Pangasinan police are concerned,” Candelario said. \nCandelario, however, lamented the involvement of high ranking PNP officials in several controversial cases, particularly in the killing of a South Korean businessman right inside the national police headquarters. \n“It’s really saddening that there are police scalawags. We condemn our fellow policemen for destroying the good image of the Philippine National Police,” Candelario said. \n“We take this as a challenge, how to rise again after this incident,” he said. – With Christina Mendez, Marvin Sy, Non Alquitran, Eva Visperas, Edith Regalado, Roel Pareño, Artemio Dumlao  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:10:42.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
