I spend so many hours at beauty sections trying out different brands, I’ve become invisible to the store attendants. \nOne afternoon, after more than an hour at Beauty Bar, I bought Eva NYC Freshen Up Dry Shampoo and Forget Me Knot Dry Conditioner. ADVERTISEMENT \nThis shampoo is a weightless spray that cleans hair without water. It made my scalp feel clean; other brands made it feel dry. Also, the shampoo left no white residue. \nEva NYC uses natural rice starch which absorbs oil and is a gentle alternative to talc or aluminum, which is harsh on your scalp. \nEva NYC Forget Me Knot Dry Conditioner is likewise an amazing product. It freshens up dull hair and gives it extra body and shine. \nAnd yes, I ended up going back for Surf’s Up Texture Spray which is now one of my fave products. I tend to have flat hair because I have it blown-dry, but I do want body in my roots. This product creates instant texture and volume because it has zeolite, a natural mineral that adds instant buildable texture without salt. \nLaura Mercier lip color \nLaura Mercier Velour Lovers Lip Color is formulated with mattifying powder and hydrating mango butter. It has a velvety texture that ensures hydration, long-lasting color and a shimmering finish in three colors: Happy (purple), Joy (fuchsia) and Smile (red). \nIt comes with three lip pencils to outline and enhance the natural shape of lips. Suitable for high-precision lines or easy blending, Laura Mercier Lip Pencil comes in three colors: Cassis, Punch and Grenadine. \nEuphoria, joy, energy and a carefree attitude are what this collection has captured. I am loving the bright colors of the lip pencils and lippies, which are complemented by a beautiful peach powder. \nWindflush Colour Powder \nWindflush Colour Powder is a single product for the eyes and cheeks—a satin-finish powder that brings a soft peach veil of monochromatic color for a natural, radiant, healthy look that will do wonders to your complexion. \nIf you’re running out of blush, I strongly suggest you try this one. I am obsessed with this product and tempted to buy one more since it’s a limited collection. The color will suit most skin tones and is the type of shade that will blend beautifully with your skin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:32:14.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
