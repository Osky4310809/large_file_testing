In particular ATMs, including white label, may be issued ₹500s and ₹100s and among ATMs category, off-site ATMs should be allocated higher proportion of cash as against on site ATMs as they are more important in last mile currency connectivity,” the RBI circular said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T11:50:32.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
