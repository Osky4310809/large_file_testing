To pour salt in the wound, this also comes just after Gigi Hadid (one of the issue's cover models) was recently called out for a racist Instagram story mocking Asian features.\nBut rest assured, Twitter is not letting Kloss get away with cultural appropriation.\nBetween confusing Destiny's Child and TLC and dressing like a geisha it appears that Karlie Kloss has been kancelled\nâ€” Ian (@muddymudskipper) February 14, 2017\nEmma Stone, Scarlett Johansson, and Tilda Swinton turn to Karlie Kloss. \"Your turn, girl.\"\nKarlie on phone: \"Hello, Vogue?

Back in 2012, Kloss walked down the Victoria's Secret runway in a Native American headdress, so she's just sticking to the rivers and the lakes that she's used to.\nShe later apologized on Twitter, but that clearly doesn't mean she learned her lesson.\nI am deeply sorry if what I wore during the VS Show offended anyone.
