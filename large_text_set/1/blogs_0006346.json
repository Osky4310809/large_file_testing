Vladimir Putin Credit: Mikhail Lkimentiev/AFP \nH e praised the intelligence community, with which he has had a combative relationship, but said hacking had \"absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election\". \nThe president-elect maintained for months that there was no evidence that Russia was behind hacks of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, despite assurances from US intelligence that the Kremlin was responsible. \nHe did not say in the statement whether he now believed Russia was behind the hacks . \nAccording to the report, the assessment from the CIA, FBI and NSA is that Russian efforts showed a \"significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations\" to interfere in US elections. \nThe agencies believe Russian military intelligence used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the Guccifer 2.0 personal to release emails that it had acquired from the DNC and top Democrats.

This is a political witch hunt.” \n“They got beaten very badly in the election. I won more counties in the election than Ronald Reagan,” Mr. Trump said. “They are very embarrassed about it. To some extent, it’s a witch hunt. They just focus on this.” \nMr Trump, who has resisted calls for a Congressional investigation into Russian hacking, asked Congress to probe a leak of the intelligence report prior to his briefing on Friday.

Mr Trump tweeted afterward asking how the network could have known the contents of the report. \nPrior to his intelligence briefing, Mr Trump visited Conde Nast, the magazine publisher, for a meeting with Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor, and other executives.

Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got \"swamped\" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nM r Trump is also preparing for a political battle over his central election pledge- a wall on the Mexican border. \nHe is urging Congress to provide funds for the wall, despite repeatedly claiming during the campaign that Mexico would foot the bill. \nMr Trump now says the US will front the money, but demand payment from Mexico after the fact. The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nM r Trump also took to Twitter to ridicule Arnold Schwarzenegger, who replaced him as Apprentice host, over the disappointing ratings for the debut episode. \nMr Schwarzenegger responded saying he hoped Mr Trump worked as hard for the American people as he did for Apprentice ratings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:21:42.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
