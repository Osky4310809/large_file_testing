The first is the 650-hp Corvette Z06 , which starts at $81,440, and the second is the newer kid on the block, the 650-hp Camaro ZL1 for a measly $62,135. The ZL1 clearly is a steal, as Chevrolet has announced it can sprint to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and reach a claimed top speed of 198 mph. \n-Tested at the High Speed Oval at Germany’s Automotive Testing Papenburg GmbH proving ground—a 7.6-mile track with 2.5-mile straights and 49.7-degree banking—the ZL1 achieved 202.3 mph in one direction and 193.3 in the other, resulting in a 198-mph average. The ZL1 earned the impressive mark using the 10-speed automatic transmission and Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar 3 tires at 44 psi. Chevy also claims that the ZL1 ran the quarter-mile in 11.4 seconds at 127 mph, hit 1.02 g in the corners, and stopped from 60 mph in 107 feet. For reference, our testing of the Corvette Z06 saw it run from zero to 60 in 3.0 seconds, hit the quarter-mile in 11.1, and grip the skidpad at 1.19 g.\n- \n-“The ZL1 was developed with high-speed performance in mind, incorporating a balanced aerodynamic package that reduces lift without significantly affecting drag,” Camaro chief engineer Al Oppenheiser said. “After testing the car in standard settings, which produced the 198-mph average, we set the front and rear camber adjustments to zero degrees and the tire pressures to the maximum allowable sidewall pressure—and saw the ZL1 average over 200 mph.” We’re skeptically eager to test that claim to see whether it holds up any better than did Ford’s similar assertion for the Mustang GT500 of a few years back, which we could only confirm is capable of 189 mph .\n- - First Drive: 2017 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 - New Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Crushes Previous Car’s Nürburgring Lap Record [VIDEO] - Chevrolet Camaro ZL1: Full Specs, Reviews, Pricing, Photos, and More - -The ZL1 uses the same engine as the Corvette Z06, the supercharged 6.2-liter LT4 V-8 rated to produce 650 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. To manage it all, standard equipment includes magnetic ride control, an electronic limited-slip differential, Brembo brakes with six-piston calipers, and a variety of aerodynamic add-ons such as a platform wing. This truly is a special time for factory sports cars, and it’s only going to get better in Chevy World with the Camaro Z/28 , the Corvette ZR1 , and the mid-engined C8 still in the pipeline.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:32:02.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
