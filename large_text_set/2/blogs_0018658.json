You'd better be prepared to buy more than one copy of each game.\nFurther Reading Footage of Nintendo Switch system menus leaks out to the wild [Updated] We recently learned that the Nintendo Switch will finally link eShop purchases to a portable online account (unlike the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS, which locked purchases to a specific piece of hardware). But we're now discovering that this feature apparently does not extend to downloading games to multiple Switch systems at the same time.\nThe news comes via a recent preview event for 1-2-Switch at the Nintendo World NYC store, which included a question-and-answer session captured by YouTuber CrazyDopetastic . A questioner talks about the potential for getting a second Switch for his children and asks, \"if I want to take my system with me... if I were to buy a digital game, could I buy it once, or would I have to buy it multiple times so they can use those games?\"\nThe translated answer, from Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development General Manager Shinya Takahashi: \"Currently we don't have a system like that in place for Nintendo Switch, but we haven't made any final decisions about how we would approach that going forward in the future, so unfortunately I can't provide any concrete answer for you right now.\"\nIn other words, for now, it sounds like a Nintendo account (and its linked eShop purchases) can only be linked to one Nintendo Switch system at a time (that's assuming nothing was lost in the translation, of course).\nAs described, this would be a pretty major difference between the Switch and competing systems from Sony and Microsoft. Both the PS4 and the Xbox One allow you to play your games across multiple consoles if you confirm your identity with an online login. As long as your Xbox Live or PSN account is logged in to two systems at the same precise moment, Sony and Microsoft don't care what specific piece of hardware you're playing on.\nPC-based services like Steam let you log in from up to 10 computers and even allow you to share your entire library with another account remotely via Family Sharing .\nThe restrictions on Switch game sharing obviously doesn't apply to physical games, which work directly in any Switch console with no need to even install the game off of the tiny cartridge . And as far as we can tell, all of the up to eight console-centric user accounts on a single Switch should be able to share any and all games downloaded to that system.\nThe Switch's portable form factor also makes it a little bit easier to physically share downloaded games with people in the same household—you can just hand them the system or insert it into a second dock hooked to another TV ( if you have $80 to spare , that is). Of course, that arrangement won't work if one of you wants to take the Switch on a trip and someone else wants to play on another system at home.\nWe're currently testing out our own Switch in Ars' Orbiting HQ and will have fuller thoughts and impressions soon, but we won't be able to confirm anything about the system's online functions until they're activated around the system's March 3 launch.", "external_links": ["http://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screenshot-27-360x200.png", "http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/Consoles-Peripherals/I-now-have-2-PS4-systems-how-can-I-share-and-play-my-online/td-p/45067590", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBpkSSf7R88", "https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/playing-across-multiple-consoles"], "published": "2017-02-22T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:18:47.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
