From the throwback movies to the rise of the barcade, it is clear that the decade still has a hold on our hearts. We have seen a lot of makeup tributes to the ‚Äô80s and now our hair can get in on the trend too!\nWe are dying over this Lite Brite Rainbow hair , especially because it reminds us of mermaid hair! In 2016, Pravana had a Show Us Your Vids contest in which hair magicians used colorful Pravana dyes. Winner, Neal Malek, drew inspiration for his new look from one of our favorite ‚Äô80s toys, but with a modern balayage twist. Our Lite Brite may be wearing dust in the attic, but we can now wear the glow on our shoulders!\n‚ú®Nƒí√òN LIGHTS ‚ú® using all @pravana - black - clear - silver - neon green - mint green - neon pink - pastel pink - pastel blue - neon blue.
