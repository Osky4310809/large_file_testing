According to Murphy, this condition isn't directly caused by her overly large chest, but it does exacerbate the problem.  \n\"I get migraines, I've got constant shoulder and neck pain,\" she laments.  \"About two and a half years ago I had to call in sick because I got out the front door and started vomiting in my front yard just from the pain and so I had to stop working.\"  \nMurphy told 9News that she is desperate for breast reduction surgery, but currently cannot afford the procedure due to her financial status and lack of private health insurance.  \nAlthough Murphy's breast reduction can be classified as medical in nature and not simply cosmetic, her case is not considered urgent enough to warrant her being skipped to the head of the line of individuals waiting for similar procedures through Australia's public health system, 9News reports.  \nSo Murphy will have to wait, just like everyone else.  According to Break, that could mean a wait time of several years due to Australia's dysfunctional socialized public health care system.  \nDr. Dan Kennedy, plastic surgeon and secretary of the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons, claims he thinks the surgery is warranted in this case.  \n\"I think breast reduction is the best operation that I do,\" Kennedy says.  He cites a recent study which followed 200 women after breast reductions surgery, all of whom showed a marked improvement in their overall health and wellbeing only a year after the operation. \n\"When people come back after their operations they say that they've had a dramatic relief in neck pain, back pain, shoulder pain, that they can exercise more freely,\" Kennedy said.  \nAccording to Murphy, her relief can't come a moment too soon.   \nSources:  9News Australia ,  Break  / Photo credit: A Current Affair/ 9News Australia \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T03:34:38.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
