A veiled threat. It was unwarranted. \n“The attitude here is that Britain's decision to leave is punitive enough for Britain. And the harder the Brexit, the more the UK will lose.” \nAccording to high level sources, “it was never necessarily in Brussels’ interest to keep Britain in the single market. It was a compromise move offered to secure a valuable ally.” \nThe source added: “Ultimately there as a lot of naivety on both sides. The one thing the EU cannot compromise upon is freedom of movement, and any hope that there would be some kind of exemption made for the UK was fanciful. \n“Conversely, there were those here in Brussels who never expected Mrs May to go as far as she did.” \nHe warned the UK should not take the desire of Germany industry to keep trading with the UK at all costs for granted. GETTY Outgoing French President Francois Hollande last year urged Brussels to “get tough” with Britain \nThe source said: “On both sides of the Channel many are paying attention to the fact British business had campaigned to remain, and now it is complaining that Mrs May is not listening. There has been a lot of frustration. \n“One thing that has hasn’t been picked up in Britain is that Germany, France and Italy are countries where ties between big business and politics are close. \nBecause of this, German executives may be prepared to put ideology ahead of business. They have said as much. \n“The leader of BDI, Germany’s CBI, made a speech recently in which he said this is not just about selling cars, it's a political project and it's more important for us to continue in this path then sell a few more cars to Britain.” May's Brexit speech: Europe reacts Tue, January 17, 2017 Politicians and celebrities tweet their reaction as Theresa May unveils her 12 point plan for Britain leaving the EU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:44:06.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
