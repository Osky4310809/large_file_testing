New Katy Perry, Who Dis? Earlier this month, the singer chopped off her hair and opted for a short, semi-buzzed style after her breakup with Orlando Bloom , who she had dated for almost a year. \nThe two remain friends. \n\"How bout a new way of thinking for 2017,\" she wrote. \"U can still b friends & love ur former partners! No one's a victim or a villain, get a life y'all!\" \n3. Katy Perry Also Sought Professional Help: In 2014, the singer talked to Harper's Bazaar about what she had taken away from her failed marriage to Russell Brand and her former relationship with John Mayer . \n\"What I've learned is that if you don't have the foundation of self-love first, you really have nowhere to pull love from to give it away,\" she said. \"I had to learn about taking care of myself before I could take care of others. I want to mommy everyone. I want to take care of them. I want to save them, and I forget myself in the meantime. I learned that through therapy .\" Dave Allocca/Starpix/REX/Shutterstock \n4.

A post shared by Paula Patton (@paulapattonofficial) on Dec 30, 2016 at 12:04pm PST \n\"The truth is it's hard for me to say this because I don't always do this, but it's being grateful for what you have,\" Patton said on Good Morning America in 2015. \"It's so easy for us to focus on the negative things, but usually, the positive in your life outweighs that. And you have to just be thankful for what you have right now.\" \n\"The thing is you can't wallow in sadness or stay in bed when you have a child,\" she said. \"And they're so full of life and wonder. And he brings me so much joy.\" Photos \nDrastic Post-Breakup Makeovers Scott Gries/Getty Images \n6.

Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. But I haven't got time to hold onto the crumbs of my past like I used to.
