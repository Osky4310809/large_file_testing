Since 2009, London Underground had allowed him to take five weeks of annual leave each summer. \nBut after a change of management, he was told that, from 2014, he would not be able to continue with the arrangement as it would be unfair on other staff. When bosses refused to let him take more than 15 consecutive days of annual leave he raised a grievance, which was rejected, before suing his employers for religious discrimination in a legal case which began in 2015. Religious calling: the Candelieri festival \nHe told an employment tribunal the festivals “have deep religious importance to the faithful, which includes me along with 100,000 others”, adding that one included the Candelieri festival, the most important in the city of Sassari, which has been celebrated for five centuries. It is on the Unesco representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. \nBut the tribunal found that his evidence was not entirely trustworthy, and his asserted religious belief requiring attendance at the events was neither genuine nor made in good faith. They found that in 2013 he had attended only nine of 17 festivals he had identified as important. They said Mr Gareddu’s motive for wanting such a lengthy period off work was more family related. Mr Gareddu appealed against the decision after his case was thrown out in December last year. \nIn the ruling, published last Friday, Employment Appeal Tribunal president Mrs Justice Simler said: “He had not invariably attended a series of festivals to the same saints each year, nor had he attended the same number of festivals each year. In light of the evidence and its findings of fact, the tribunal found that the true or genuine reason for wanting a five-week period was not the claimant’s religious beliefs or their manifestation but was his wish to be with his family.” \nMr Gareddu said today the decision was “shameful”, adding he had fought the case on a matter of “principle”. \nHe told the Standard: “I am disappointed. The implications of this case are severe. They felt it was not true I wanted to attend religious festivals — they completely misunderstood. \n“I went there feeling it was a pretty straightforward process and that I would have won. They did not understand what another person’s belief is based on.” \nA Transport for London spokeswoman said: “We are an equal opportunities employer and will always seek to accommodate the requirements of our employees where possible.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:19:26.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
