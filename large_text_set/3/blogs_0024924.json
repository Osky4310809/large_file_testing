I put the meat between two pieces of parchment paper and then use my pounder and pound away till the meat is not more than a half-inch thick. Season with salt and pepper. In one bowl, add the milk and eggs and stir. In another bowl, add the flour and more salt and pepper. Put about a half-inch of olive oil in a giant cast-iron pan on top of the stove and heat till ready for frying. Dip each piece of meat first in the milk mixture, then the flour, then milk, then flour. Fry! Fry each piece until both sides are golden brown. Put the steaks on a rack in a lightly heated oven until everything else is ready. If you put them on a plate with a paper towel, the bottoms might get soggy. Make the gravy. For the gravy: Pour out most of the olive oil until there is just a nice light coating on the bottom of the pan. Make sure you leave all the good stuffâ€”the little bits of flavor. In a cup, mix the flour and the chicken broth and stir together. Add to the highly heated pan and stir. The mixture will start to thicken and turn brown. Then add the milk and stir until that thickens, too. Add salt and pepper to taste. To serve: Put the CFS on a plate with the mashed potatoes and green beans. I serve the gravy separately so people can add their own at the table.
