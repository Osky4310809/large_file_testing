NASA has been mapping exoplanets for a number of years. When is the NASA press conference? This artist's impression shows the planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri B, a member of the triple star system that is the closest to Earth (Photo: Reuters) \nThe American space agency teased details of the official announcement - which will be made at 1pm in Washington on February 22, 2017. \nThat means it'll be revealed at 6pm on Wednesday evening over here in the UK. Read More \nThe press conference is expected to last roughly an hour - although it could take longer depending on questions from the media. There may also be the possibility of questions from the public. How can I watch the NASA press conference? An artist's conception shows the rocky exoplanet GJ 1132b, located 39 light-years from Earth. New research shows that it might possess a thin, oxygen atmosphere - but no life due to its extreme heat (Photo: Dana Berry / Skyworks Digital / CfA) Read More \nNASA says it will be live streaming the whole event - as well as posting regular updates on social media. \nThe space agency has its own TV channel that it broadcasts on its website . \nIf you want to follow it on social media, you can use the hashtag #askNASA on Twitter. The agency says it will be used for questions as well. Who is taking part in the NASA press conference? A view of the surface of the planet Proxima b orbiting the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri (Photo: SWNS) \nThere will be five scientists associated with the space agency taking part in the announcement. They are: Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington Michael Gillon, astronomer at the University of Liege in Belgium Sean Carey, manager of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at Caltech/IPAC, Pasadena, California Nikole Lewis, astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore Sara Seager, professor of planetary science and physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge What do we expect to learn? An artist's impression of a planet inside NASA's \"habitable zone\" capable of supporting life (Photo: NASA) Read More Mysterious electrified 'alien cloud' captured on camera in deep space for the very first time \nThere was a lot of excitement in July 2015 when NASA revealed it had found an exoplanet that closely resembled Earth. \nWe could be in for a similar bombshell tomorrow evening. Either NASA has discovered another potentially-habitable planet or it is likely to have more information on the ones we already know about. \nThe big news would be if it has found a planet with an oxygen-rich atmosphere. \nThe agency uses the Kepler Space Telescope to scan the cosmos for exoplanets that fall into the \"Goldilocks zone\" of its parent star. Any planet with a surface temperature and atmosphere that supports liquid is of huge interest to the agency. Has NASA found alien life? Aliens (Photo: Getty) NASA astronaut Scott Kelly returned from a year in space YOUNGER than his identical twin \nThis is a possibility - but remains distinctly unlikely. \nIf NASA believes a planet is capable of supporting microbial life it will still need to gather more details to be sure. Thus could involve sending a probe to examine a planet more closely. \nSince launching in March 2009, Kepler is the first NASA mission to find potentially habitable Earth-size planets. \nFor four years, the Kepler space telescope monitored 150,000 stars in a single patch of sky, measuring the tiny, telltale dip in the brightness of a star that can be produced by a transiting planet. \nThe agency is keeping tight-lipped about what it's found this week, but it did say that details of its findings will be published in the journal Nature once the press conference begins.
