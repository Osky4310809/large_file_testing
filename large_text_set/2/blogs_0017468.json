For the first time in more than a century of history, these distinctive features of the genuine \"Alfa spirit\" have now come together in a sport utility vehicle. Its name is the Alfa Romeo Stelvio and it aims to rewrite the rules in the medium-sized premium SUV segment. \nExciting handling \nAlfa Romeo cars have always incorporated the combination of lightness and efficiency essential for agility and good handling on any type of road and in all weather conditions. The new Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV is no exception, delivering impeccable handling, worthy of a real sports car, proven by balanced weight distribution, a direct steering ratio and state-of-the-art suspension, as well as the lavish use of ultra-lightweight, hi-tech materials including the carbon fibre drive shaft and the introduction of a new generation of aluminium engines. \nWhat's more, thanks to the sophisticated Q4 all-wheel drive, Alfa Romeo Stelvio customers can rely on excellent road-holding even on low-grip terrains. On request, the SUV can also be equipped with the mechanical self-locking rear differential. Taking the wheel of Alfa Romeo Stelvio is the prelude to a thrilling driving experience that makes travelling irresistible, regardless of destination. \nPerfect weight distribution \nOne of the primary objectives of the design of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV was to achieve maximum driving pleasure. One of the factors that contributed to this achievement was definitely the perfect weight distribution between the two axles - a distinctive feature of the Alfa Romeo construction tradition - which required special management of the weights and materials involved, achieved both by adjusting the car's layout and by placing the heaviest units in the most central position possible. 2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio \nUltra-lightweight materials and aluminium engines \nThe ideal weight/power ratio is the outcome of ultra-lightweight, hi-tech materials, such as carbon fibre for the drive shaft and aluminium for the engines, suspension systems, hood, wings, doors and tailgate. These elements reduce the SUV's total weight and provide excellent torsional rigidity, a guarantee of quality over time, a quiet ride and exceptional handling even in extreme conditions. \nSuspension system with exclusive AlfalinkTM \nA new double wishbone suspension with a semi-virtual steering axis, optimising the filtering effect and guaranteeing rapid, accurate steering, was developed for the front suspension. This exclusive Alfa Romeo set-up allows Stelvio to tackle high lateral acceleration thanks to its always-perfect footprint. The rear suspension uses a four-and-a-half link system - patented by Alfa Romeo - to deliver extremely precise control of the wheel's characteristic angles, for handling at the top of the car's class. \nMost direct steering ratio in the segment \nRegardless of speed and conditions, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV always delivers a natural, instinctive drive, thanks also to the most direct steering ratio in its segment (12.0). \nAlfa Romeo Q4 all-wheel drive \nA mountain hairpin, a stony unpaved trail, a snow-covered straight or a bend in the driving rain: all extreme situations and ideal places for putting the new Alfa Romeo's agility and power to the test. Thanks above all to the Q4 system, that gives all the benefits of all-wheel drive combined with the driving pleasure of a rear-wheel drive. In detail, its architecture includes an active transfer case and front differential designed to meet the specific technical requirements of Alfa Romeo, entailing the rapid-response management of high torque levels, with a compact, lightweight set-up. The Q4 system continuously monitors numerous parameters to optimise torque distribution between the two axles according to what the car is doing and how much grip the road surface offers. In normal grip conditions, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio with Q4 system acts like a rear-drive vehicle, with 100% of the torque sent to the rear axle. As the wheels approach their grip limit, the system transfers up to 50% of the torque to the front axle. This translates into top-in-class control in terms of traction and directional stability on corners. \nMechanical self-locking rear differential \nThe optional mechanical self-locking rear differential transfers more torque to the wheel with most grip, to optimise traction in any driving conditions. \n100% Alfa Romeo sporty design \nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio is a perfect blend of heritage, speed and beauty; and its magical alchemy forms an integral part of the brand's history, dating back over a century. Achieving this mix, now as in the past, involves combining the three ingredients of Alfa Romeo design: proportion, simplicity and top-quality surfacing. These same ingredients gave us the Giulia - the new Alfa Romeo benchmark and precursor of the brand's future - and have been comprehensively reworked to adapt them to the altogether different volume of a Sports Utility Vehicle. \nSporty style with stunningly sleek, glamorous lines \nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio's proportions, with a modest length of 468 cm, height of 167 cm and width of 216 cm, express strength, dynamism and compactness. The side view confirms this impression, with an outline that suggests a compact car, starting at the front and developing towards the rear, and a cabin that ends on a steeply raked rear hatch, topped with a spoiler for maximum aerodynamic performance - crucial on a car that packs this much punch. \nThe Alfa Romeo styling also finds expression in the high-quality surfacing, which involves creating rich, harmonious reflections across the volumes. The end-result is a sculptural shape, which on the flanks, for example, gives rise to stark contrasts between the surfaces that catch light and those that remain in the shadow. Basically, the \"musculature\" of the car's sides accentuates its front and rear wings. \nThe third aspect of Alfa Romeo style is the \"simplicity\" that masks one of the most complex creative processes in the industry: designing a car. Because styling has the job of concealing the long, complex task of creating the simple, natural lines that highlight the shapely elegance and tasteful sophistication of Italian-made products. This same approach pervades the entire history of Alfa Romeo design, which has always expressed itself through clean, taut lines. That's why the Stelvio has such a strong identity, built around a few select features, like the legendary cloverleaf front end, which is perhaps the most famous and recognisable hallmark in automotive styling. The back end of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio is instantly eye-catching too, because of the sporting appearance it gets from its lower portion, characterised by the two exhaust tips, and from the \"Kamm tail\" styling that gives the car a unique, unmistakeable character, while also paying tribute to Alfa Romeo's history - because this distinctive design also featured on some of its most prestigious performance-oriented models and competition cars. \nTo underline this beauty of line, the customer can choose from 13 body colours (pastel, metallic and tri-coated) that highlight the Alfa Romeo SUV's sleek silhouette. \nElegant interior and luxury materials \nThe sporty inspiration of the exterior also guided the pens of the Alfa Romeo stylists, who created an interior with simple, elegant lines that offers the very best in terms of quality, safety, equipment and comfort while keeping in mind the characteristic that comes from deep in the Alfa Romeo psyche: the centrality of the driver. This all-important driver-focus is reflected in clustering of all the controls on the steering-wheel, intentionally small and with a direct ratio to suit all driving styles. What's more, the colour information display cluster (3.5\" or 7\" depending on the version) supplies the driver all essential information, while the driver/car interface consists of two rotary controls for easy, immediate use of the Alfa DNA selector and Alfa Connect system. \nForged around the driver, therefore, the interior has a diagonal tunnel and slightly undulating dashboard, and it has been \"tailored\" like a bespoke suit, with painstaking craftsmanship and premium materials: the aluminium, real wood, leather and fabrics have all been chosen for their visual and tactile appeal and assembled to give a palpable sense of human artistry. Turning to specifics, the Stelvio version conveys its strong sports-car pedigree with the choice of black for the seat fabric, as well as the dashboard, door panels and mats. The Super version offers techno-leather and fabric seats available in three colours (black, black/brown and black/red), a perfect combination with the dashboard and door panel options, in black, black/brown or black/red, as chosen by the customer. To conclude, this version can also be equipped with luxury seats upholstered in choice full grain leather (in black, brown, red or beige) and the leather racing-style seats (in black, brown or red), with real wood or aluminium inserts, sill with metal inserts and two different steering wheels: luxury with superior quality leather and sports with specific grip and leather wrapping. \nInnovative engineering for unbeatable safety \nIn keeping with Alfa Romeo's technical traditions, electronic assistance must never be intrusive, but merely facilitate the driving experience, which is exhilarating in itself thanks to the perfectly designed chassis and suspension system. The new Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV keeps faith with this philosophy: it is structurally unique and exciting, but it still features a large number of sophisticated safety systems, available as standard or optionals depending on the version. \nIntegrated Brake System (IBS) \nThe new Alfa Romeo SUV is the world's first car in its segment to offer the new electromechanical system that combines stability control with a traditional servo brake. With its superlative combination of electronics and mechanics, this system not only cuts weights, gives an excellent driving \"feel\" and eliminates all pedal vibration but also guarantees instant brake response, meaning a much shorter braking distance. \nForward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Brake with pedestrian detection \nForward Collision Warning (FCW) is the system that uses a radar sensor and a camera incorporated in the front windscreen to detect any obstacles or vehicles in the car's trajectory, warning the driver of the risk of an imminent collision. Should the driver fail to intervene, the Autonomous Emergency Brake (AEB) system automatically brakes to avoid impact or mitigate its consequences. What's more, thanks to the pedestrian detection function, which works by interpreting the radar and camera data, the AEB system can stop the car on its own at speeds up to 65 km/h. \nLane Departure Warning (LDW) \nThe system reads the lines on the road surface by means of the video sensor installed on the windscreen, and if the driver strays across the lane boundaries involuntarily or without using indicators, the driver is alerted at once with audio and visual warnings. \nBlind Spot Monitoring (BSM) \nBlind Spot Monitoring (BSM) continually monitors the rear blind spots on both sides of the vehicle, by means of two radar devices mounted in the rear wings. In potential risk situations, lights on the wing mirrors alert the driver to obstacles on either side of the vehicle. \nRear Cross-Path Detection \nThe system checks the area behind the car when reversing, and warns of other vehicles approaching perpendicular to the car at speeds below about 35 km/h. \nActive Cruise Control \nActive Cruise Control (ACC) constantly monitors the gap in relation to the vehicle in front, and reduces the car's speed if it falls below the safety threshold. When the road is free again, active cruise control automatically returns the car to the pre-set cruising speed. \nOutstanding performance \nDesign, engineer and technology are all central to the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Stelvio, but, as tradition demands, its identity as a true Alfa Romeo derives from the beating hearts under the bonnet: 280 HP 2.0 Turbocharged petrol and 2.2 Diesel of 210 HP. They are combined with an automatic 8-speed transmission and Q4 all-wheel drive. \nThey belong to a new generation of all-aluminium four-cylinder engines that represent the very best of the Group's engine design technology. Both Stelvio engines are built in Italy at the Termoli (petrol) and Pratola Serra (Diesel) plants, in areas assigned only to Alfa Romeo engines, with state-of-the-art processes and methods that put them at the top of their class in terms of performance and fuel economy. \nThe range will be completed with new engines including the 200 HP 2.0 Turbocharged petrol-fuelled and the 180 HP 2.2 Diesel, both with an automatic 8-speed transmission and Q4 all-wheel drive. The 180 HP 2.2 Diesel will also be available with real wheel drive. \n2.0 Turbocharged petrol \nThe new HP 2.0 Turbocharged petrol engine (280 HP at launch, 200 HP in the near future) is a 4-cylinder unit built entirely in aluminium with carbon drive shaft, combined with the automatic 8-speed transmission and Q4 all-wheel drive. In addition to MultiAir electro-hydraulic valve actuation, the distinctive features of this engine include \"2-in-1\" turbo and 200-bar high-pressure direct injection, which pair up to deliver particularly snappy accelerator response across the rev range in addition to first-class fuel-efficiency. \nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio 2.0 280 HP turbocharged Petrol engine (peak torque of 400Nm at 2,250 rpm) is best in class in terms of acceleration, powering from 0 to 100 km/h in just 5.7 seconds. The top speed is 230 km/h. \n2.2 Diesel \nThe second engine is the 2.2 Diesel - available in two power versions: 210 HP at launch and 180 HP in the near future - and is the first Diesel engine in Alfa Romeo's history to be constructed entirely in aluminium. With four cylinders in-line, it features the latest-generation MultiJet II injection system with Injection Rate Shaping (IRS) and operating pressures of 2,000 bar. The electrically-operated variable geometry turbocharger offers state-of-the-art mechanics, minimises response times and at the same time guarantees benefits in terms of efficiency. The sophisticated driving satisfaction and comfort levels are also guaranteed by the use of a balancing countershaft. And, in a market \"first\", the 210 HP 2.2 Diesel is equipped with a turbocharger speed sensor. The performances are thrilling: the Alfa Romeo Stelvio 210 HP 2.2 Diesel reaches a top speed of 215 km/h and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.6 seconds. \nAutomatic 8-speed transmission \nBoth Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV engines are teamed with the automatic 8-speed transmission specifically calibrated for fast, smooth gear shifts. The transmission has a lock-up clutch to give the driver a powerful feeling of in-gear acceleration once the gear is engaged. Depending on the mode chosen with the Alfa DNA selector, the automatic transmission optimises fluidity, comfort and ease of driving in all environments, including around town, and further improves fuel economy and CO2 emissions. Steering-column-mounted, aluminium paddle shifters are available. \nOn-board comfort and wellbeing for driver and passengers \nAlfa Romeo Stelvio gives the driver a feeling of complete control and mastery of the road, thanks also to the high driving position and the new Alfa DNA selector. What's more, the new model brings the secrets of Italian hospitality into the world of the medium-sized premium SUV: its interior and equipment set out to re-create the atmosphere of an exclusive, tasteful, elegant luxury lounge. Proof is provided by the interiors with their wonderful colour combinations and quality of materials, not to mention the excellent on-board comfort delivered by the dual zone climate control and sophisticated Alfa Connect infotainment system. But no hospitality is complete without the pleasure of music, so Alfa Romeo Stelvio has a sophisticated audio system - with subwoofer in some cases - for a genuine concert-hall experience, with a sound that embraces all occupants. The Stelvio SUV is tailored in all respects to embody Italian verve, comfort and taste. \nComplete mastery of the road thanks to the high driving position \nAlfa Romeo Stelvio is designed and built with drivers' wishes and new needs clearly in mind. The driving position is at the state-of-the-art: the high seat gives mastery of the road, without the slightest reduction in the driving pleasure expected of a genuine Alfa Romeo sports car. This feeling of total control is reinforced by the large windows, and the wraparound seats give an even more sporty driving experience. \nHigh quality, genuine materials for a luxurious interior \nIn the interior, the colours and materials have been carefully selected together: premium materials - such as aluminium, real woods, leather and fabrics - have been chosen for their visual and tactile appeal and assembled to give a palpable sense of human artistry. So Alfa Romeo reasserts its tradition of finely crafted interiors, while using these new, original material and colour combinations to underline the distinctive role of elegant colour schemes in its products' identity. \nAlfa Connect 3D Nav 8.8\", the highest Infotainment level \nAlfa Romeo Stelvio is equipped with the ground-breaking Alfa Connect system - developed in partnerships with Magneti Marelli - with a sophisticated set of features and functions, especially the latest-generation HMI interface, with the system controlled from the Rotary Pad and the display (6.5\" or 8.8\", high-resolution) incorporated in the dashboard design. In addition, thanks to \"optical bonding\" technology, the user benefits from an excellent level of visualisation and readability on the display. \nWith a leading-edge voice recognition system, the device allows full connectivity with all mobile devices (cell phones, smartphone and tablet computers with Apple iOS and Android operating systems). \nThe new Alfa Romeo SUV's latest-generation infotainment system not only controls the DAB digital radio and Hi-Fi digital audio but also provides a Bluetooth system for hands-free telephony and for playing audio contents from USB devices and smartphones. \nThe entire range is supplied as standard with a 6.5\" display (also with 2D navigation function on request) with optional Connect 3D Nav 8.8\", supplying navigation with high-resolution 3D maps and high-speed route calculation, also available without a GPS signal thanks to the Dead Reckoning technology, and functions for TomTom map updating from the USB port, driving style information display and indication of the current Alfa DNA mode selection. \nAlfa DNA \nAlfa Romeo Stelvio features the new Alfa DNA selector, which modifies the car's dynamic behaviour as selected by the driver: Dynamic, Natural and Advanced Efficiency (new energy-saving mode). \nSpecifically, Dynamic mode accentuates performance and reactive handling. The steering response is more precise, braking is more immediate and the electronic control systems do not interfere with the pleasure of sports-style driving. Natural mode is ideal for urban and motorway contexts. Handling is tailored for comfort and fuel economy. Finally, the new Advanced Efficiency maximises energy savings and minimises emissions levels. \nExcellent load capacity and electric tailgate with adjustable opening \nAs well as a thrilling driving experience, Alfa Romeo Stelvio guarantees the very best in terms of the comfort and versatility typical of this category. For example, the 525 litre boot is in line with the best competitors and has a convenient electric tailgate that can be configured - directly from the Alfa Rotary selector - with eight different setup levels, for optimal boot access. The interior also has plenty of room available for passengers to enjoy and share the pleasure of travelling. \nAudio systems of outstanding quality for an exciting sound experience \nThe entire range is equipped as standard with the sophisticated audio system with eight speakers (4 woofers and 4 tweeters). In addition, a further two systems are available on request: the first has 10 speakers (4 woofers, 4 tweeters, a mid-range and a subwoofer in the boot), while the second, produced by Harman Kardon, has an amazing 14 speakers (4 woofers, 4 tweeters, 5 mid-ranges and a subwoofer). \nComplete range to meet all requirements, from private customers to fleets \nThe new Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV's equipment and prices may vary from country to country. The text below details the figures common to all markets. More specific, detailed information is available on the local press sites. \nThe range comprises three versions (Stelvio, Super and Business), two engines (280 HP Turbocharged petrol, 210 HP Diesel), combined with an automatic 8-speed transmission and Q4 all-wheel drive. The customer can choose from 13 body colours and 13 alloy wheels of 17\", 18\", 19\" and 20\". \nThe range will be completed with new engines including the 200 HP 2.0 Turbocharged petrol-fuelled and the 180 HP 2.2 Diesel, both with an automatic 8-speed transmission and Q4 all-wheel drive. The 180 HP 2.2 Diesel will also be available with real wheel drive. \nSpecifically, the basic version of the new Alfa Romeo SUV comes with a lavish standard outfit including 6.5\" Connect system, Alfa Rotary selector, premium audio system with 8 speakers, Alfa DNA selector with new Advanced Efficiency mode and instrument cluster with 3.5\" colour TFT display.

Also available is the Sport Pack, including heated sports steering wheel with specific grip and leather wrapping, racing-style leather seats in black, red or brown, with electric adjustment and heating system, aluminium inserts and steel pedal. \nThe Cassino plant behind the new-generation Alfa Romeo models \nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio is manufactured at the FCA plant in Cassino (Frosinone, Italy). Constructed in 1972 near the historic Benedictine abbey, the plant has produced over 7.3 million cars to date and been expanded to occupy a site of two million square metres, including 530,000 square metres of covered area. The plant has a production capacity of approximately 1,000 cars a day and employs around 4,300 people. \nRenovated for the production launch of the Alfa Romeo Giulia, the plant is a shining example of FCA's global automotive manufacturing expertise, where people, technologies and the environment combine in harmony to build two cars of immense prestige: the Alfa Romeo Giulia and the Alfa Romeo Stelvio. It has adopted and aligned all the technologies and best practices of the other FCA plants worldwide, updating them to build unique products. The plant also continues to manufacture the Giulietta, which embodies the same, authentic Alfa Romeo spirit, expressed through the five factors that make it one of the world's most desirable automotive brands: distinctively Italian design; state-of-the-art engines; perfect weight distribution; unique engineering; and an excellent weight/power ratio. \nPoints of excellence \nThe work place has been scientifically designed on the Work Place Integration principle: every worker played an active role in the creation of his or her workstation, with the aid of visual simulations. The goals achieved include safeguards for employees' health and quality of work. \nAnother factor on which FCA has focused strongly is Change Management, a new way of living and working within the plant. This involved more than 700,000 hours of training and the creation of the new, fundamental role of team leader, a worker who heads a squad of another six colleagues on the production line itself. In addition, World Class Manufacturing principles were applied to design a streamlined production process with a drastic reduction in the risk of human error and wastage of resources in key areas such as material flows, handling and transport of vehicles. \nMajor investments were made in technology, all intended to achieve the highest quality. The Assembly area was created to give staff the very best technical and physical working conditions, while the Body shop, equipped with more than 6,100 items of equipment including robots, welding systems and control systems, is highly automated. The crowning glory is the Paint shop, the first in the world to use a technology with ultra-low environmental impact, which contains more than 100 robots. A total of 25 external colours are available. \nCassino designated as a World Class Sustainable Plant \nAnother of the plant's special characteristics is its prioritisation of the environment, one of the pillars of the renovation. Reflecting this, the site's main avenue has been rechristened \"Quadrifoglio Avenue\" and lined with installations informing employees and visitors about the measures undertaken to make it a location of excellence, by using the latest occupational health, safety and environmental protection technologies. \nThe avenue forms a kind of open-air museum and those who use it can see that the Body and Assembly shop processes reuse the same water several times, while the new primer booths in the Paint department are now water-free, having replaced it with dry filters. A rainwater reservoir is also under construction. The water collected will be treated by natural methods (phyto-purification using special plants) and then used in the industrial process. \n\"Use, reuse and recycle\" is the plant's motto: all processing residues are reused or sent to specialist partners and converted for new uses. Waste has become a resource. As well as minimising energy use through state-of-the-art technologies, the use of LED lamps and heat recovery, the plant only consumes electricity from certified renewable sources. But that's not all. Roofing the car park with photovoltaic panels generates electricity. With a panel surface area equivalent to two football pitches, the estimated peak power output is a massive 3 MW.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:22:35.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
