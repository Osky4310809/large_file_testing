Now a new report claims to have an image of that tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, while also showing its included S Pen.\nSee also: Best Android tablets 4 weeks ago Both the render and the report come from the German language site WinFuture.de , via unnamed sources. The pressure-sensitive S Pen will not have a way to store it in the Galaxy Tab S3, as the similar S Pen on the company’s Galaxy Note phones have done. Also, the story is reporting that there will just be a 9.7-inch version, as Samsung will not offer an 8-inch edition as it has with other tablets in the Tab S series.\nThe tablet will have a 2048×1536 SuperAMOLED display, along with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor inside, according to the report. It will also have 4GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. It’s also supposed to have a 12MP rear camera and a 4.7MP front-facing camera. The tablet is supposed to come in Wi-Fi only models, along with ones with both Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity. Finally, the story claims that Samsung will sell the Galaxy Tab S3 in its normal black color, along with a silver version, which is meant to take the place of the previous white color option.\nThe story claims that the starting price for the Galaxy Tab S3 could be about $580, and we would assume that is for the Wi-Fi only version, and not with the one with the additional cellular wireless hardware. As always with these kinds of unconfirmed reports, take this one with a grain of salt until we get the official word from Samsung.\nIn the meantime we will be attending the company’s MWC 2017 press event and will get the first-hand info and impressions about whatever Samsung will reveal. There are rumors that the company could show a video preview of its next major smartphone flagship, the Galaxy S8 , at the event on Feb. 26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:47:33.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
