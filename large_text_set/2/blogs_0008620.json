His present is good and we need him.

He is one of those players that when he is on the pitch he tries when he always gives something. \n\"I know that last season under no pressure, last season in front of the goal, the goal was bigger. I know this season the expectations are higher, the pressure is higher and the goal is smaller. \n\"He is missing some chances he’s not scoring as many goals as he could because he gets lots of playing time on the pitch.
