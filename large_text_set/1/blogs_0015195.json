And where were they going? “To Europe.” \nVasilis, a hairdresser and part-time film maker, was mystified and returned to investigate why people were starting to journey through the sleepy area.

Every day I went, I was seeing more and more people.” Read more Hungarian camerawoman sentenced for kicking and tripping up refugees \nWhat started as a trickle of refugees crossing from Greece to Macedonia on the way to western Europe would turn into a flood, with hundreds then thousands of people starting to pour through the previously unknown village of Idomeni every day. \nIt has since become one of the largest refugee camps in Europe, housing 15,000 people in squalid conditions until Greek authorities started clearing the area in May . \nBtu the magnitude of the crisis to come was not foreseen over two years ago, when Vasilis found families hiding in fields without shelter, water or food. \nHe and his friends started gathering donations and delivering necessities when they could. \n“We could not allow this to happen metres away from our houses, we had to do something,” he said. “The local people are a very conservative society but they started to support us. So we decided to take some donations and see what we could do.” Refugee crisis - in pictures Refugee crisis - in pictures 1/27 \nA child looks through the fence at the Moria detention camp for migrants and refugees at the island of Lesbos on May 24, 2016.

The flow of migrants arriving in Passau has dropped to between 500 and 1,000 per day, down significantly from last November, when in the same region up to 6,000 migrants were arriving daily. \nThe small band of volunteers quickly realised the situation was growing beyond their meagre capabilities, once taking 300 sandwiches, only to be confronted by 500 asylum seekers waiting to cross the border. \nMany were severely ill, with pregnant women and babies among the crowds, so Vasilis started to use his car as a makeshift ambulance ferrying refugees to friends’ houses and convincing local doctors to treat them without payment. \nHe quickly gained the trust of the new arrivals, who revealed they were being charged by smugglers exploiting the lack of authorities to leave Greece, then again by gangs over the border to enter Macedonia. \nOn one night in May 2015, Vasilis got a phone call from a refugee he had helped, saying they had been beaten by more than 100 mafia members inside Macedonia and fled back towards Greece. \n“Everyone came back bleeding, we had to take 11 people straight to the hospital,” he said. “They stole the Syrians’ papers and passports.” \nThere were still no authorities and no charities on the ground at Idomeni, but the number kept on increasing as Vasilis and other locals gave what help they could to around 1,000 people arriving every day. \n“We were using our own money, we weren’t getting any help from Europe,” he said. “We couldn’t continue any more, the numbers were too many.” Migrant men help a fellow migrant man holding a boy as they are stuck between Macedonian riot police officers and migrants during a clash near the border train station of Idomeni , (AFP/ Getty ) \nHaving alerted local authorities, politicians and NGOs to the dire situation, Vasilis was invited to speak at the European Parliament in April 2015. \nHe then went to media in the UK, France and US to invite journalists to document the growing scale of the “catastrophe”.

We need to know who is coming and where from.” \nVasilis fears the crisis and terror attacks are making Europe more conservative and susceptible to radicalism as it “lives under fear”. \nBut he is continuing to do what he can for the refugees of Idomeni, despite receiving no salary and turning down jobs at NGOs. “I’m still working with them, I’ll never stop, ” he said. \nThe hairdresser, whose work is supported by the Open Society Foundations, has travelled around Europe to meet some of his 20,000 contacts. \nMany have sent messages of thanks from their destinations including the UK, Germany and Sweden. \nEiad, who now studies in Frankfurt, wrote: “Syrians will never forget what you personally offered, what you have done, and Greece... we will never forget dear friend Vasilis.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T20:22:06.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
