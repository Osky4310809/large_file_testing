Because does she ever not look amazing? Her hair, her makeup — it was all so perfect. But it was Cuoco’s cleavage-baring Globes dress that stole the show .\nHer Tommy Hilfiger dress was absolutely gorgeous and verrrry revealing — in the classiest way , of course. So Cuoco decided to call out her plunging neckline in a hilarious Instagram post. The photo was taken with her glam squad just before she headed out the door to The Beverly Hilton.\n“Heading to the Golden Globes with my golden globes good job team! @bradgoreski @daniela_viviana @jamiemakeupgreenberg @christinesymondshair (and Mr Kc),” she captioned the photo. A photo posted by @normancook on Jan 8, 2017 at 6:21pm PST \nGolden Globes/cleavage jokes aren’t new, but they seem to never get old. Because ‘globes,’ you guys.\nCuoco also posted a pic of her hair that sort of looked like she just casually threw it back into a loose French braid by herself, but happened to create the most beautiful, perfect look. Of course, that wasn’t the case at all.\n“@christinesymondshair creating hair magic with her teeny pixie dust ✨,” she wrote.\nA photo posted by @normancook on Jan 8, 2017 at 6:25pm PST \nHere’s another shot of that dress (and the globes joke again): ✨ ⚡️globes indeed \nA photo posted by @normancook on Jan 9, 2017 at 12:38am PST \nAnd this one of Cuoco with her handsome boyfriend: A photo posted by @normancook on Jan 9, 2017 at 12:41am PST \n“Boy in Ralph Lauren ✨girl in Tommy Hilfiger thank you to the humans who got us all put together takes a village!
