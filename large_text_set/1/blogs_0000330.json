The fans at the stadium, the viewers of the broadcast and the players on the sideline all felt it. Another angle of that Michael Floyd block. pic.twitter.com/FXWUx1tZEY \n— Henry McKenna (@McKennAnalysis) January 1, 2017 \nEdelman, who was a few feet away from the play, certainly did.

I felt some wind go by,” Edelman told The Boston Globe after the Patriots’ 35-14 win over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. \nFloyd de-cleated Dolphins cornerback Tony Lippett , who went into concussion protocol after the play. He was eventually cleared. \nFloyd finished his second game with three receptions for 36 yards and one touchdown reception. The block won’t appear on the stat sheet, but it was just as important as any of his receptions. Lippett looked as if he might have been able to track Edelman down, but Floyd took care of that, \nThe touchdown came after the Dolphins scored 14 unanswered points. It helped the Patriots return the momentum to their side. \n“I was just doing the extra stuff, to get the job done for other guys. You know, I thought maybe Lippett might have been able to catch him,” Floyd said. \nFloyd played feisty in Week 17. His end zone trip came after he’d been tackled by three Dolphins defenders with a fourth in the area. But he hammered his way into the end zone . \n“He’s tough, he’s physical,’’ Edelman said. “He can be in the room any time when I’m here. I like him.” \nFloyd joined the team with character concerns, as he was charged with a DUI and the Arizona Cardinals released him within the week. Their team president later spoke out against Floyd for being “unapologetic .” Patriots players and coaches, however, have had nothing but good things to say about the receiver.
