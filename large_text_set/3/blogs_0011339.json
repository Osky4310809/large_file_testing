The cases retail for a price range between $1,800 and $5,500. As tech publication The Verge cheekily points out, \"You can buy about seven iPhone 7s for the price of Louis Vuitton's top-of-the-line case.\" (See also: Top 7 Companies Owned by Louis Vuitton .) \nThe series is called Eye Trunk to evoke the luxury house's beginnings as a designer of high-end luggage trunks. The cases are made of golden crocodile leather and designed by Nicolas Ghesquière, current creative director at the firm. If that case is a tad too expensive for you, then there are other options . For example, LVMH itself has a case in its product rack that is half the price of a single iPhone. The most expensive iPhone case in the world is designed by Anita Mai Tan. It costs $880,000 (roughly the price of 1,257 iPhone 7s) and is made of 18-carat white gold encrusted with real diamonds. \nIn a separate but related development, LVMH is planning to aggregate its own brands and those of its competitors under a single website, according to The Financial Times . The company has 70 separate fashion houses that retail under different price points. Growth for LMVH has been sluggish in recent times, in keeping with industry trends. The slowdown is largely due to China's economic problems. However, ecommerce is expected to contribute up to 12 percent of the overall sales in the luxury market by 2020, according to Boston Consulting.
