After he feeds and befriends a stray cat, more and more cats arrive and invade his yard. While the trailer is only available in Japanese, it seems to capture the sheer delight of a cat infestation perfectly. Masaru can’t stop smiling and admiring his growing cat family.\nNeko Atsume is a free-to-play, cat-collecting smartphone game from the developer Hit-Point that became increasingly popular in 2015 and 2016. As of December 2015, it had been downloaded more than 10 million times. Players put out food and toys in their virtual yard to attract cats. Once the cats arrive, players can bond with them and take pictures of them. The cats also reward players with presents that can be traded in for better toys and food–with the end goal of attracting yet more cats.\nDirected by Masatoshi Kurakata and starring Atsushi Ito, Shiori Kutsuna, and Tomorowo Taguchi, Neko Atsume no Ie hits Japanese theaters on April 8, 2017.\n(Via io9 and CrunchyRoll ; image via screengrab)\nWant more stories like this?
