We go on vacation together. He’s real excited that I’m here.”\nHanks was in fact happy to see his ex when he finally appeared on the show — assuring host Kelly Ripa that “it’s not awkward going on national television being interviewed by your old college girlfriend.”\nSteve Granitz/WireImage “We met 20 years ago!” Philipps remarked. “And we hang out a lot. And I do have moments where I think, ‘How cool that we knew each other at this formative moment together?’ ”\nHe agreed.\n“We got our first televisions shows within the same week. We got our first movies within the same week,” Hanks, 39, said. “We were able to go through all the really special moments in a young actor’s lives together.\nBesides the two hanging with each other’s spouses, their kids also go to the same school!\n“We get to do morning school drop off together,” Hanks said.\nRELATED VIDEO: WATCH: Busy Philipps Reveals the Epic Birthday Surprise She Has Planned for Her Daughter! \n \nPhilipps has an two girls — Birdie, 8, and Cricket, 3 — with husband Marc Silverstein, who was kind enough to send her throwback photos of she and Hanks from the late ’90s to share on air.
