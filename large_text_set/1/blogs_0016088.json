Photo: Chiat/Day/Apple \nJanuary 17, 1984: One week before it made its more famous appearance at the SuperBowl XVIII, Apple’s iconic “1984” ad debuts as a pre-movie trailer in movie theaters. To sell its revolutionary new Macintosh computer, Apple buys several months of ad time from theatrical ad distributor ScreenVision. The ad gets such a favorable reaction from audiences that some theater owners keep re-airing the ad after Apple’s contract comes to an end. Apple’s most important ad \nThe fact that Apple’s “1984” ad — which depicts a sledgehammer-wielding freedom fighter taking on a “Big Brother” figure supposed to represent IBM — was aired just once is something that has been erroneously claimed on several occasions. \nThis isn’t actually the case. Yes, the ad was most memorably aired at the SuperBowl in 1984, but its theatrical run is less commented on. The ad’s earliest showing was, as it happens, at 1am in Twin Falls, Idaho on the last day of 1983, so as to make it eligible for ad awards the following year. (I didn’t cover that particular event in “Today in Apple history” because it fell on a Saturday.) \nThe “1984” ad was directed by Ridley Scott, who was then best known for directing Alien and Blade Runner , although he had a strong advertising background. It played on imagery from George Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” novella, and presented Apple as the rebels against a technocratic elite. \nAt the time it was shot, Apple’s board of directors was worried about the ad. \nIt was certainly a lot gloomier than the company’s previous commercials, which had traded on the comedic timing of Apple celebrity spokesperson Dick Cavett . There was nothing cuddly about the Macintosh ad, however, which was firmly rooted in the burgeoning dystopian cyberpunk aesthetic. \nUltimately, it was Steve Jobs’ support which got the Macintosh ad aired as promised. It turned out to be a massive critical success — even if an argument could be made, based on poor early Mac sales, that it didn’t hard sell the computer enough. \nNevertheless, it was event marketing, and the fact that people still talk about it and use it as a reference point years later makes it critically important in Apple’s history. \nWhat is your favorite Apple ad of all time?
