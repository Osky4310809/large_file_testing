In keeping with the vacuity, the infant’s name was the next hot topic of debate.\nAnd why just that? It is amazing how national points of conversation, levels of shock quotient and debates move like one massive tsunami from one triviality to another. The most innocuous bits of information get shared and then shredded to bits. The Karnataka CM makes a faux pas calling Sichuan “Siachen” and even before he has had an opportunity to redress that, the Nation is preening, indulging in public shaming. Rahul Gandhi opens his mouth and the nation jumps down his throat! Soon as cellphones reverberate with simultaneous beeps, gazes swing to screens only to sweep up in gossipy shock again. And the next meaningless discussion begins…\nSuch a dependence on the next “breaking news” indicates a lack of excitement and meaning in our everyday lives. A consistent outward focus implies an inward disconnect, suggesting that rather than live our own lives, we are happier discussing those of others. After all, someone who is deeply involved with his or her own life will find little time for such vacuous discussions. So Kareena had a baby. Big deal! She is neither the first nor the last female to have had one.\nAre you even living your own life? Or, do you just live the lives of others vicariously? What did you do today? Was your day worthwhile? And as each day merges into another, is your life worthwhile? What makes life and living worthwhile?\nLife is not just to be lived through, and by merely surviving you have not done your bit. It is important to figure out the purpose we are here for and then chart our movement towards it.\nWhat then makes life worthy? Here is my take —\nConnect & Understand – The people in our lives are present for a reason. It is in the relationships we strike that we learn life’s biggest lessons. The way we nurture these relationships, deal with people we love, like, tolerate or hate teaches us invaluable lessons about ourselves.\nAspire & Achieve – You need a reason to face each morning with excitement, and a dream makes the future pleasing and promising. If you have a dream, lay out a plan to meet it and that will fill your life with purpose and happiness. Your dream is your unique life purpose. Give it two hours early every morning and it will make your day, even life, worthwhile.\nAsk & Answer – Debate is important and energising; gossip and slander is useless and enervating. Rather than allowing floating bits of information to engage your mind, energy and time, pick up issues that matter to you and make whatever small difference you can. Better still, seek out critical issues of public policy and governance and see how you can engage with these in a meaningful manner. Debate existential questions related to life and death.\nRelax & Rejuvenate – Hobbies and activities that help relax us are an important tool for the mind and help break silos not just within but around us as well. Music, art, reading, writing and theatre – all serve to relax even as they help chisel and sharpen the mind.\nLearn & Grow – At the end of the day if you have picked up one new thing that gives you a sense of satisfaction – your day has been worth its while! Looking back on the past days, weeks, months, you will see a pattern emerge – a pattern of growth and fulfillment. Travelling to new places and meeting new people accelerate the learning.\nThese are some of the things that make life worthwhile in my opinion.
