So until I'm told otherwise I will carry on doing what I'm doing. Attitude and performance \n\"But I have to say, my help and the people helping me, doesn't take away from the fact that the players have to focus what they can control, and they can control their attitude and performance. Martyn Waghorn hauled Rangers level from the penalty spot but Inverness ran out winners \n\"You haven't got the space and I haven't got the time to convey how I'm feeling. Suffice to say we are walking away with nothing and that's not good enough for this football club. This club has been and will be again about winning football matches and we haven't managed to do that. \n\"We weren't clinical enough in either box and we paid the price. \n\"You saw a group of players who were focused, I thought for 25 minutes we were great, but it's the same old problem, if you don't score when you have the chance and you let in too many goals, then you are not going to take too many points home.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:35:15.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
