A formal declaration of famine indicates that people are dying of hunger.\nAlbert Gonzalez Farran/AFP/Getty Images This file photo taken on October 11, 2016 shows a mother breastfeeding her child who suffers acute malnutrition at the clinic run by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Aweil, northern Bahr al-Ghazal, South Sudan. ]South Sudan's government said on February 20, 2017, that the country's over three-year war has led to famine in parts of the nation, while nearly half the population was going hungry.

Many families have exhausted every means they have to survive,” said Serge Tissot, representative of the FAO in South Sudan.\nThe agencies painted a grim picture of the situation in the impoverished country, saying that 100,000 people are at risk of starvation and that one million more are on the brink of famine.\nAbout 5.5 million people, or about half of South Sudan’s population, will face severe food shortages by the summer unless more relief is provided, they said.\nSouth Sudan, which became independent from Sudan in 2011 with strong support from the U.S. government and the international community, descended into conflict in December 2013, when President Salva Kiir fired his vice president, Riek Machar. The ensuing war took on ethnic overtones, with Kiir’s Dinka group battling members of Machar’s Nuer group.\nKate Holt/UNICEF via AP In this photo taken Thursday, Oct. 20, 2016 and released by UNICEF, a boy has his arm measured to see if he is suffering from malnutrition during a nutritional assessment at an emergency medical facility supported by UNICEF in Kuach, on the road to Leer, in South Sudan. Tens of thousands of people have died and more than 1.5 million have fled the country.\nThe U.N. officials said that war had disrupted agriculture, the main occupation in many parts of the country, crippling the economy and leaving people unable to feed themselves. People were relying on “whatever plants they can find and fish they can catch,” Tissot said. The two counties affected by famine are in Unity, an important oil-producing state in the north.\nIf sustained and adequate assistance is delivered urgently, the hunger situation can be improved in the coming months and further suffering mitigated\nThe U.N. agencies said that more humanitarian aid is needed to prevent the famine from spreading to other areas.\nKate Holt/UNICEF via AP In this photo taken Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016 and released by UNICEF, a young girl who fled fighting in nearby Leer in recent months, queues for food aid at a food distribution made by the World Food Programme in Bentiu, South Sudan. “If sustained and adequate assistance is delivered urgently, the hunger situation can be improved in the coming months and further suffering mitigated,” the agencies said in a report.\nU.N. officials have complained that both government and opposition forces have blocked humanitarian convoys and attacked aid workers, making it difficult to bring assistance to the worst-affected areas.\nRelated ‘Famine 2016’: A Syrian refugee child’s harrowing drawings show a family’s journey — and struggle Uganda says it’s willing to redeploy troops in South Sudan as nation teeters on brink of civil war Jeremy Hopkins, head of UNICEF in South Sudan, said that more than 250,000 children are severely malnourished and that if they do not receive food immediately, “many of them will die.”\nThe officials said the hunger crisis is the worst since fighting started three years ago.\nSouth Sudan has experienced starvation before. In 1998, a famine occurred in the region of Bahr El Ghazal after a prolonged drought and fighting between forces supporting Sudan’s government and rebels seeking independence for the south.\nThe United Nations has been alarmed by the recent deterioration in South Sudan. In December, U.N. officials warned that “ethnic cleansing” was taking place and that an “all-out ethnic civil war” could occur.\nLast week, Arif Husain, the World Food Program’s chief economist, told Reuters that 20 million people could die of starvation over the next six months in famines in northeastern Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:40:34.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
