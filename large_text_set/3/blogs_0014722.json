It would be more difficult now! \nIniesta wants to finish at Barca \n“He's a person I respect a lot. Of course, he's capable of playing for Barca because for me he is one of the top three players in the world in his position. \n\"I enjoy playing with him a lot and, with complete respect to everyone else, we see a different Madrid when he's there and when he's not.” \nRakitic, who has netted six times in 38 appearances this season, will not be leaving Camp Nou any time soon as he recently penned a new contract which commits him to Barca until 2021.
