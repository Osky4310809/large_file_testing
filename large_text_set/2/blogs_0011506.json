That's the same foundation that, in recent years , has contributed millions toward Klyde Warren Park, the Highland Park ISD , the Perot Museum of Nature & Science, the Family Place, the Dallas Police Department and countless other organizations. Sneak peek at the Museum of Street Culture inside historic 508 Park Ave. downtown \n\"The Moody Foundation is thrilled to financially support such an innovative project that will serve our diverse community, support arts and education, and preserve part of Dallas' unique history,\" said Frances Moody-Dahlberg, chairman and executive director of the Moody Foundation, in a prepared statement. \"This is an extraordinary project that will create a collaborative environment to bring together disparate worlds and people of all faiths and cultures.\" \nEncore Park executive board chair Buddy Jordan said the Moody grant pushes the capital campaign just past the $10-million mark. \n\"It's exciting,\" said Alan Govenar, the Dallas historian, author and playwright who has spent several years planning and curating the museum devoted to, among other things, art and music made in Dallas over the last century. \"It's amazing. It's unprecedented. It's a national story.\" \nInitially, the Museum of Street Culture was going to be limited solely to the confines of 508 Park Ave., which was built in 1929 to house Warner Bros. movies but is best known as one of two spots in which blues legend Robert Johnson recorded in the late 1930s. But as the project has evolved, its scope has grown. Preservation efforts under way for 508 Park structure in downtown Dallas \nThat's evidenced by Wednesday's other piece of news: Designer Adrien GardĂ¨re , whose work includes the Louvre-Lens Museum in France and the renovation of the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo, has also signed on to help design the museum. \nGovenar said Wednesday that the museum has partnered with the Nasher Sculpture Center, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Museum of the City of New York, Sony Music and others on various exhibitions and projects planned before and shortly after the museum's doors open in spring 2018. Artists from The Stewpot will still exhibit their works in the museum, which has been the plan for years, but now Govenar said they're also talking with London-based Ace Records about installing a 78-rpm recording studio in 508 Park Ave., in approximately the same spot where, on June 19 and 20, 1937, Johnson recorded \"Love in Vain Blues\" and \"Hellhound on My Trail,\" among other immortals. \n\"There's nothing like it anywhere in the world,\" Govenar said, \"this unique partnership between social services, art and creativity.\" \nEight years ago 508 Park Avenue appeared to be a goner : The 23,000-square-foot building was under siege by city attorneys who said it was a hazard, and the owners at the time threatened to demolish the historic structure where Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys, who came to define the sound of Western swing, also recorded in the summer of '37. It was spared from the wrecking ball by its across-the-street neighbor First Presbyterian Church in June 2011. \nThe property's already been reborn in recent years: One building was torn down in 2012 to make room for an amphitheater next to 508 Park Ave., which is adorned by a sculpture wall by Christy Coltrin and Brad Oldham that tells the story of the city and the neighborhood. A community garden has also taken root on the other side of the iconic structure. \nThe museum was first announced in January 2012, during which time 508 Park Ave. has been gutted and restored and the museum's plan scrapped and rewritten, over and over. \n\"When you're doing something you believe in, you lose track of the time behind you,\" Govenar said about the passing years. \"You're only looking at today and tomorrow. We're mission-driven people. We want to make a difference in Dallas. We want to set a better example for the rest of the world.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:53:23.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
