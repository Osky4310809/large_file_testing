Along the way, however, a young fan couldn't help but steal the show. \nWhile on board the bus, Benjamin Brady celebrated in his own special way. Turn up the music because it's time to dance. \n\"Rain drop. Drop top,\" Tom wrote on Instagram with video of his son's epic moves. \"Benny dabbin on the boat with his Papa!\" Photos \nCelebs at Super Bowl 2017 \nAnd while dad may be called the greatest quarterback in NFL history, he's also just your typical cool dad. \nDuring the parade route, Tom had to wipe his son's nose . And without any tissues nearby, he had to rely on his good ole fashion clothes for assistance. All parents who have experienced this, please say aye. \nThe past few days have been nothing short of unforgettable for Tom, his three kids and wife Gisele Bündchen . And despite celebrations on and off the football field , someone in the family wouldn't mind a break from football. \n\"If it was up to my wife, she would have me retire today,\" Tom shared on SiriusXM NFL Radio. \"She told me that last night three times.\" \n\"I said, 'Too bad, babe, I'm having too much fun right now,'\" he continued. \"You know, I feel like I can still do it, and if you love what you do and you're capable of doing it then, I mean, I'd be so bored if I wasn't going out there, knowing that I could still do it. So I'm going to work hard to be ready to go and I still plan on playing for a long time.\" TAGS/ Football , Sports , Celebrities , Tom Brady , Top Stories Additional  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:22:02.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
