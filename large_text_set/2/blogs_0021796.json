In DC Comics canon, Bruce Wayne’s parents are murdered by a criminal known as Joe Chill during a family outing, leaving a young, orphaned Bruce to be raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth. He later conceives the vigilante alter ego of Batman to avenge his parents’ deaths and rid Gotham City of evil. \nRight now, it’s unclear how much Snyder will draw from previous comic or film depictions for his portrayals of the Waynes. \nIn addition to Affleck as Batman, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”— the sequel to “Man of Steel”— will introduce Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and Jason Momoa as Aquaman . Henry Cavill will reprise his role as Superman. \nCoincidentally, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who was recently cast as comic book villain Negan on “The Walking Dead,” is also rumored to be making a cameo in Snyder’s upcoming superhero pic as as Thomas Wayne, the husband of Cohan’s character.
