If this happens, wicket keeper batsman Mohammad Rizwan will have to leave his place to make room for Akmal. It's also a fact that the experienced wicket keeper batsman Kamran Akmal is not going to be the first choice for wicket keeping, reason being the presence of Sarfaraz Ahmad in the squad. \nOn the other hand, reports claim that coach Mickey Arthur has reservations over Kamran's selection as a fielder/batsman. He is also of the view that inclusion of Akmal at the age of 35 may go against future plans. 0 0 Kamran Akmal all set to make a comeback was posted in sports of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on March 08, 2017 and was last updated on March 08, 2017.
