It also doesn’t address tax proposals. That will come with the full Budget, released later this year. Advertisement Advertisement \nYou can see what our current discretionary spending looks like here . The majority of it ($582.7 billion) already goes to defense spending. The Trump administration proposed a $54 billion increase in this for 2018, along with a $2.6 billion down payment for a border wall. \nThat money has to come from somewhere, and most of it will come from the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and the Agriculture Department, all of which will have a huge cut in funding in 2018 if the Trump administration gets its way. If that’s not alarming enough, there are agencies and programs that would receive no funding at all. The 19 agencies the Trump administration wants to eliminate funding for are: African Development Foundation ($26 million): A foreign aid agency that works on economic development in Africa. Appalachian Regional Commission ($119 million): They focus on economic growth in 420 counties. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board ($11 million): Created by the Clean Air Act of 1999, they investigates chemical accidents. Corporation for National and Community Service ($771 million): They’re best known for the Americorps program. Corporation for Public Broadcasting ($485 million) : Supports public television and radio stations, including PBS and, indirectly, NPR. Delta Regional Authority ($45 million): They focus on economic development for the Mississippi Delta region. Denali Commission ($14 million): An economic development agency for Alaska. Institute of Museum and Library Services ($231 million): Helps fund the nation’s 123,000 libraries and 35,000 museums. Inter-American Foundation ($23 million): The foundation supports “citizen-led grassroots development” in Latin America and the Caribbean. U.S. Trade and Development Agency ($66 million): This agency promotes U.S. exports in the energy, transportation, and telecommunications industries. Legal Services Corp. ($366 million): A congressionally chartered organization to provide free civil legal advice to those who can’t afford it. National Endowment for the Arts ($152 million): Created in 1965, they support participation in the arts in communities. National Endowment for the Humanities ($155 million): They support “research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities.” Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp . ($175 million): They support affordable housing programs. Northern Border Regional Commission ($7 million): Focused on economic development in Maine, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont. Overseas Private Investment Corp .($63 million): They support U.S. private investment in other parts of the world. U.S. Institute of Peace ($40 million): A federal institution that focuses on conflict prevention around the world. U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness ($4 million): They help coordinate government efforts to reduce homelessness. Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ($11 million): They provide scholarships and fellowships in social sciences and humanities. \nUSA Today has the full list of specific programs , most of which are part of the Environmental Protection Agency.
