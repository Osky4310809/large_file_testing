Zlatan Ibrahimovic holds off David Meyler (Photo: Getty) \nThat approach was tested to the limit with United's relentless pressure, Jakupovic again coming to his side's rescue just before the break, after a swift attacking move from United. \nMichael Carrick picked out Ibrahimovic with a sweeping ball, the forward's instinctive flick setting Paul Pogba through on goal. \nUnited's world record £89million signing looked destined to score, but Jakupovic managed to palm his goal-bound effort behind, thwarting United once again. \nMourinho sensed he needed to change things around and brought on skipper Wayne Rooney for Carrick at the start of the second-half, with Herrera dropping deeper.
