Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool are bracing themselves for a fight with FIFA over star defender Joel Matip over a possible one-month ban. \nThe centre half was this week called up by his country Cameroon for the Africa Cup of Nations, which begins in Gabon on January 14, despite insisting he had retired from international football more than a year ago. \nMatip – who is currently injured - has refused to go, but it has emerged he could be banned from playing by the world governing body for the duration of the tournament, which lasts until February 5. \nCameroon boss Hugo Broos has refused to back down in his confrontation with the player, and named him in the squad for the finals, along with seven other players who have said they will not play.

The rules also state that if he doesn’t travel, then the player can be banned for the entire length of the tournament. \nThe rules even demand that the FA intervenes if the deadlock continues, and the English game’s governing body could also be sanctioned, along with Liverpool, if they do not act.
