More storage, but more pricey \nTrendForce accurately predicted Apple's lineup of 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage options last year and this year, it says the 32GB option will be replaced with 64GB instead. \nBesides that, the iPhone will apparently also do away with the Home button, instead making it part of the display - 3D facial recognition might also be introduced to complement Apple's Touch ID. Latest rumours also says Apple is upgrading its front cam to support this new 3D facial recognition tech, which would be a step up over iris recognition. \nSo for those looking for a less expensive (though it won't be cheap) iPhone might be served by the 4.7in display model, with 64GB of storage. Those with more money might stump for the latest iPhone 8 that would come with a 5.8in iPhone with OLED. \nThere will also be a 5.5in display, like the iPhone 7s. So we're looking at an iPhone 7 SE with 4.7in display, iPhone 7S with 5.5in and an iPhone 8 with a 5.8in. The SE will likely only have 2GB of RAM while the other two will come with 3GB. \nTo prepare for the best of iOS to come, why not brush up on your iOS 10 skills with our handy iOS guide ?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:00:57.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
