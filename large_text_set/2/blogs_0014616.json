We as consumers now should boycott buying any new cars to pressure the car makers to reduce prices. \nCurrently Malaysia has the highest car prices in the world. And we in Malaysia have one of the lowest pay packets. Most Malaysians, spend their entire life paying for their cars, now 9 year loans are the norm. After 9 years of slogging paying the loan, the car also kind of mati from wear and tear and this forces us to take another 9 year loan to buy another car. The cycle goes on for the next 50 years of your life. \nWe Malaysians take about 6 or 7 car loans our entire life and all we do is pay off the loans our entire life. Most Malaysians don’t really own a car like Westerners as Westerners just buy outright without loans. Pity we Malaysians have to take loans and struggle paying high car prices. \nLet us refrain from buying any new car. This will pressure the car makers to reduce prices. Ironically, all car makers in Malaysia are GLC or Government owned. So, if the Government wanted to reduce car prices, it is up to the Government to tell their own GLC to reduce car prices. \nProton is DRB (GLC). Perodua is UMW (GLC) Honda is DRB (GLC), Toyota is UMW (GLC), BMW is Sime Darby. Hyundai is Sime Darby. Ford is Sime Darby…..and the list goes on and on and on. \nIf you want to buy a car, go buy it second hand. A bit of advice to Paul Tan, many Malaysians are scared to buy 2nd hand cause most of the car dealers modify their odometer and cheat. Then some 2nd hand dealers take even years to transfer the name of the buyer (grant)despite you surrending the car long ago. Some even have surrendered their cars to used car dealers and the banks still chase them for unpaid monthly loans. This has left a bitter experience for most people and most people end up buying new cars. \nCan Paul Tan and team set up a forum for just private sellers. Many Malaysians want to buy 2nd hand cars but there are hardly any private sellers. We want to buy direct from sellers. I hope Paul Tan can facilitate a forum where we all can search only private sellers.
