I think the fans feel a bit cheated and that they didn't get full value. Payet left West Ham in January \n\"He insisted on only going to Marseille. It was one club bidding, so that depressed the price. It was £25m instead of maybe £35m. \n\"I don't think he handled it very well. Does anybody? I suppose the answer is we are disappointed but we have to move on. There is life after Dimitri Payet.\" \nAsked if the Payet affair had put the club off buying high-profile imports, Gold admitted the club would prefer to shop locally. \n\"David Sullivan, me, Slaven, we prefer English players or players who have experience of the Premier League,\" he said. \n\"That's why we have just recently moved for two players [ Jose Fonte and Robert Snodgrass] with tremendous pedigree.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:17:22.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
