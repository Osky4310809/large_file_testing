Support is already dropping: \nVoters are divided on the measure: Approval of the bill declined from 46 percent last week to 41 percent in the new poll, conducted last Thursday through Sunday. Disapproval, meanwhile, ticked up marginally, from 35 percent last week to 38 percent in the new survey. More voters, 22 percent, strongly disapprove of the bill than the 17 percent who strongly approve of it. [...] \nRepublicans continue to support to bill: 62 percent of GOP voters approve of the bill, while only 18 percent disapprove. And while Democratic opposition — 57 percent disapprove — lags Republicans’ backing, more Democrats strongly disapprove of the law, 40 percent, than Republicans who strongly approve, 28 percent. \nThe Politico/Morning Consult poll also finds that more voters think the plan (which this poll does not identify as a Republican measure) would make the healthcare system worse than think would improve it and more voters understand that it would decrease the number of people with health insurance than believe it would increase that number. Notably, this poll also finds higher approval ratings for Donald Trump’s job performance than other polls. \nThe House is scheduled to vote on Trumpcare on THURSDAY, MARCH 23. Even if you already called your member of Congress, do it again by calling the Capitol Hill switchboard at (202) 224-3121. Jam the phone lines, urge them to vote NO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:58:31.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
