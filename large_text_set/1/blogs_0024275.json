Within 48 hours, his swimming pool business, River Pools, lost a quarter of a million dollars after five clients pulled their deposits. By January 2009, three consultants had suggested filing for bankruptcy. However, if Marcus filed, he and his partners would lose their homes and their 16 employees would lose their jobs.\n\nMarcus knew he had to generate more trust, traffic, leads, and sales than ever, and he had no money to do it. So he looked at the Internet. Marcus read all about inbound marketing, content, and blogging. He learned that addressing his prospects' questions, issues, fears, worries, and concerns on the business website could help the business be successful.\n\nIn March 2009, Marcus told his two business partners that the company needed to live by a new philosophy: \"They Ask. You Answer.\" Marcus brainstormed all of the questions he'd ever been asked and found that the major questions were often ones businesses don't like to answer online.\n\nCommitted to the new philosophy, however, Marcus began writing blog posts about customers' questions, including the good, the bad, and the ugly. The company became committed to answering questions more consistently and transparently than anybody in their space.\n\n\n\nListen to the show to discover how this new approach transformed the website's traffic, leads, and sales.\n\nOnline Content Overload\n\nNow that many websites have taken the same approach to content that Marcus did, I ask Marcus what advice he would give to any business owner concerned that approaches to website content have changed.\n\nMarcus says he's really bothered when businesses assume they shouldn't share their philosophies or content because they think everything has already been said. Those businesses are letting other people in their industry create the content.\n\nBusiness leaders also think they shouldn't share content because their content isn't amazing. Marcus disagrees and notes that initially his writing and video content were bad. However, he kept going and now his content is good.\n\nListen to the show to hear what false idea Marcus says everyone believes.\n\n\n\nThe Five Subjects That Make a Difference\n\nIn any industry, Marcus says buyers want to discuss five subjects as they research a company, product, or service online, and addressing these subjects on your website will help you reach your marketing goals.\n\nCost questions\nProblems questions (what the drawbacks and issues are)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T13:16:27.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
