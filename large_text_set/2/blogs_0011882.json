And Gemma’s there too backstage, getting a cuddle from Emma Willis. \nGavin and Gemma were the first ever couple to marry from Take Me Out, and had a baby and got married two years later. \n“I can’t believe how it all turned out,” Gavin told the Mirror in 2015. “If someone said two years ago that I’d meet the love of my life, be marrying them and expecting a baby, I would’ve told them to go away.

Falling in love with Gemma is so exciting but it took me by surprise. I’m just really glad I went on the show.” \nIn the talent stage of the show, Gavin impressed Gemma with his rendition of Guns ’N’ Roses song Paradise City, dressed as guitarist Slash. \n“Anyone prepared to go on national TV in a wig, leather pants and giant crocodile shoes can’t take himself too seriously,” explained Gemma back at the time. “I thought we’d probably get on.” \nThe Voice , Saturday on ITV at 8pm Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:44:08.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
