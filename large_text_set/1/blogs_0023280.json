Getty Images\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abruptly and indefinitely postponed planning for an LGBT youth health summit after Donald Trump’s election to the White House, a source at the agency told TPM.\n“This was supposed to be a big deal,” said the source, who requested anonymity given the politically sensitive nature of the cancellation. “They had a whole communications team on it, it was going to be on Facebook live. The intention was to plan a 5-year agenda.”\nCopies of internal planning documents provided to TPM refer to a one-day gathering in which “national leaders” would meet at the CDC’s Roybal campus in Atlanta in order “to address the health and well-being of LGBTQ youth.” The source told TPM that staffers were first informed about the event in late September and weekly planning meetings were held through the week of the election.\nTPM made multiple attempts to obtain comment from the CDC about the event, but no additional information was forthcoming.\nNews of the summit planning's cancellation comes days after partners working with the CDC on a climate change and health conference scheduled for February told news outlets that the long-planned event had been canceled due to concerns about the Trump administration’s reception of it.\nThe CDC source told TPM that organizers at the Division of Adolescent and School Health did not publicize the LGBT youth heath summit prior to the election in order to avoid drawing unwanted or politicized attention to the initiative.\nThe source said that event planners, assuming Hillary Clinton would win the presidency, had started putting together a list of potential partner organizations including the YMCA, Human Rights Campaign and Matthew Shepard Foundation, but were waiting until after Nov. 8 to extend formal invitations. The event was initially planned for mid-December, but planning documents show the date for the summit was pushed back in late October to Jan. 12.\n“From the very beginning when we were talking about partner decisions it was made very clear that no discussions were to leave CDC and that the invitations would be sent out to the big national nonprofits the day after the election,” the source said.\nThose formal invitations never went out. Preparations continued through Friday after the election, but the following week’s planning meeting was canceled without notice and replaced with a “next steps” conference call, according to the source. Organizers were thanked for their work and informed that the summit was postponed indefinitely on that call, while a new internal workgroup on LGBT youth health also was proposed, according to the source.\nA general view of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta Thomson Reuters\nAn email to staffers working on the event, dated Nov. 18 and reviewed by TPM, also stated that the summit was postponed.\n“It was never actually explicitly said by anyone that we’re canceling this because Donald Trump won the election,” the source said.\nAt least one of the nonprofits that the source said the CDC had been considering inviting to serve as an event partner after the election said the agency had indeed made some preliminary contact about the summit.\n\"The Y was invited to participate in some planning calls for the event, but that’s as far as our involvement went and we were made aware the event was postponed,\" YMCA spokesman Kevin Dietz told TPM in an email.\nMatthew Shepard Foundation executive director Jason Marsden said he did not recall any contact, while spokespeople for the Human Rights Campaign did not respond to TPM’s multiple requests for comment.\nThe sudden calling off of an event months in the making confused and upset organizers.\n“The whole reason that I went to work in the CDC was because I wanted to devote my career to impacting health outcomes for sexual and gender minority youth. So to have been part of the planning committee for the convening of the summit and to have it ripped out away for me or at least canceled because people in leadership thought it was going to be a bad idea…” the source said, trailing off.\nRead the original article on TPM .
