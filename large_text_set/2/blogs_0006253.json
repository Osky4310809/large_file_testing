Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2016 \nIt’s not surprising that Fadli would adopt The Donald’s campaign rhetoric. After meeting with the then Republican candidate for president in New York in May 2015 (during a visit to Trump Tower followed by an infamous appearance at one of his press conferences ), Fadli seems to have become a big fan of the (shudder) current US president. \nHe didn’t just congratulate President Trump on his upset(ting) win. Fadli told reporters he was happy for The Donald’s victory and that he had always believed the celebrity businessman would become the next US president . He’s also said that Trump could be good for Indonesia’s economy, citing the Trump’s resort developments in Java and Bali as evidence he could bring more investment from the US to Indonesia . \nBut how could he have been happy about Trump’s win, considering all of the Republican’s disturbing talk about implementing a ban on Muslims entering the US during his campaign? \n“That was just campaign rhetoric, his governmental policies will definitely be different,” Fadli told Tempo on January 19, just eleven days before Trump signed executive order banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from temporarily entering the US (which many argue is effectively a “Muslim ban” like he promised on the campaign trail). We’ve searched the Indonesian media extensively since Trump’s travel ban was enacted and have not seen a single mention of Fadli denouncing the US president for his anti-Muslim executive order (the only time he seems to have mentioned Trump recently was to argue that Gerindra-backed Jakarta gubernatorial candidate Anies Baswedan would win next week’s election despite his seemingly poor poll numbers ). And his “Make Indonesia Great Again” tweet seems to suggest he’s still a fan of Trump's rhetoric. \nIt’s interesting then, that Fadli would not speak out against Trump’s ban and continued anti-Muslim rhetoric, which many consider a terrible insult to the followers of Islam. \nBecause he certainly didn’t hesitate to condemn another politician who allegedly insulted Islam.
