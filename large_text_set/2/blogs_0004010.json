The Taliban extremist movement was itself born in Pakistan,” he said. \nMeanwhile, according to Nafithat Tawasul (communications window) of the Interior Ministry, they are 82 Pakistani suspects of terror and security issues who are currently held in intelligence prisons. \nAccording to the window, as many as 15 Pakistanis, including a woman, were nabbed following the recent terrorist operations in Al-Harazat and Al-Naseem districts in Jeddah. \n0 0 39,000 Pakistanis deported from Saudia Arabia in four months: media report   Abdullah Al-sadoun, Geo, Geo News, Pakistan, Pakistani Deported, Riyadh, Saudi Gazette, Saudia, World, World News.   \"39,000 Pakistanis deported from Saudia Arabia in four months: media report\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/130186-39000-Pakistanis-deported-from-Saudia-Arabia-in-four-months-media-report .
