Within minutes, hackers were doing their thing and posting images of border crossings, allegedly obtained from border security cameras. \nTechnological border surveillance is but one “layer” of a multifaceted border protection system and includes Integrated Fixed Towers, a Remote Video Surveillance System and aerial monitoring initiatives, according to Wired . \nThe question, after the electronic infrastructure is in place, is the investment in monitoring. And it appears we have a ready army of citizen volunteers. The U.S. Border Patrol needs help. Hackers need a life. Surely I can’t be the first to suggest we get these nice folks together. @polNewsNetwork1 This should be advertised everywhere! Bored? Catch an illegal! Mad? Catch an illegal!
