Following last week's sizzling \"Gucci On My,\" featuring 21 Savage , YG and Migos , Mike Will dropped \"On The Come Up,\" featuring Big Sean . \nWhile Mike Will samples and skews an opera singer's vocals in an endless loop, Big Sean goes hard on this track. Paired with a deep 808 bass, \"On The Come Up\" is one of those summer tracks that bad boys like to blast on their speakers when they want to stun respectable citizens downtown.
