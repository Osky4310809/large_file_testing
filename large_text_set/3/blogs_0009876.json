The Georgia State Senate honored the Atlanta rapper for his efforts in helping to improve the city’s water infrastructure and used the moment to call attention other happenings in his hometown. \nAtlanta’s local NPR station WABE reported on Killer Mike’s time at the state senate building, which occurred Friday morning (March 10). The Run The Jewels artist has used his platform several times in the past to address political matters, and once more did the same while being hailed for an earlier effort that involved a drill named “Driller Mike” that will bring emergency back-up water to the city. \n“Our children deserve decent housing. Gentrification should not make children poor,” said Killer Mike from the chamber’s floor. “Our school systems deserve more attention. Our teachers deserve more money. Our firemen deserve more money. And our policemen deserve more than new guns. They deserve to have enough cops on the street to be involved in the community.” A post shared by Killer Mike (@killermike) on Mar 10, 2017 at 9:21am PST \nKiller Mike also regaled the Senate with a story of when he first visited the building as a teenager with a teacher. \n“Because of his course that year I fell in love with my city, with my state, and the political process. When I imagined myself here as a kid, I was dressed in all black like Run-DMC and I had on a gold chain. So you guys are indulging the fantasy of a child who made an A in Georgia history,” he said. \nState Sen. Nan Orrock sponsored the resolution that recognized Killer Mike and the city for the efforts to improve water conditions for Atlanta residents. \nThe burly rapper posed for photos with Sen. Orrock and stated that he intends to campaign for Sen. Vincent Ford, who is a mayoral hopeful and co-sponsor of the resolution.
