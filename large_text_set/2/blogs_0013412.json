He remembered the in-fighting, the self-interest - in short, what life was like for football fans, pre-Frank Lowy. He had a point. \nFrank Lowy did incredible things for the game. Sometimes we forget, but the setting up of the A-League, entry into Asia, three World Cup qualifications, an Asian Cup win, TV deals that returned actual money - were all unheard of achievements, and took monumental powers of persuasion, determination and skill. What we have today isn’t perfect, but it’s a vast improvement on many levels. Frank Lowy.   \nYet even great leaders have to pass into history. That point arrived in November 2015, and it is really when the current brouhaha between Federation, clubs and (increasingly) the states began to fester. It should also have been the time when the issue was resolved. \nIt wasn’t, because like my journalistic friend, the game wasn’t brave enough to have the argument. It remembered what it was like to be hungry, and opted to bend to the will of the man who’d put food on the table. \nSo, we got a corporate style “election” - and an outcome that produced a hand-picked board, led by the incumbent’s son. That’s not meant to be disrespectful to Steven Lowy, the current Chairman. He was, and is, a capable businessman, a big football fan, personable, and driven by the need for consensus in decision-making; much more so than his father. \nBut he was always going to be held more accountable than Lowy senior. Back in 2003, the game had demanded Frank. In 2015, the game was bequeathed to Steven. A big difference. FFA Chairman Steven Lowy.

Fergie was a legend at Manchester United for his past achievements, but that didn’t mean he was automatically an expert on the future. \nThe fact is, the Australian game has drifted since November 2015. With the exception of the TV deal and the marquee fund, there remains an awful lot on the “to do” list. \nCrucially, despite a board containing some very sharp fiscal minds (some of whom are virtual unknowns, even to the clubs), the sport remains under-capitalised. Perhaps because of that, there remains only a vague commitment to hot ticket items such as expansion, and strategy remains sketchy with long-term plans short on detail. All the while, the other stakeholders remain outside the tent, despite having to foot much of the bill, in continuing to finance an under-resourced game. \nThis has led us to the current state of affairs, where the clubs in particular, have had enough. On Tuesday, they met with FFA, 24 hours after the State Federation Presidents had their day in court. On Friday, it’s the turn of the players union.

Source: Getty Images \nAt the root of the argument is not just the division of the TV money, nor even the expanded congress, which will probably happen in some shape or form anyway. \nIt is whether the game has the ability to unite its stakeholders, and work together for the good of the game. That’s the golden ticket outcome. \nIs FFA willing to withdraw from its dominant position? It has to, in my opinion. Benevolent dictatorships only work for as long as they keep the masses happy, and that point has clearly passed. After all, the board is there to serve its stakeholders - not the other way around. Steven, and his team still have a huge contribution to make, but the game can no longer be run exclusively by a small, mostly Sydney-based, cabal. \nBut equally, can the clubs be trusted with greater responsibility of taking the domestic game onto the next stage, while simultaneously protecting the many national teams? \nEven more importantly, will they be any better at delivering the sort of returns that have eluded FFA? Plus, on vital issues such as expansion, will they allow the best qualified clubs in, or will they retreat into their self-interested, protectionist positions?

For reform to be processed, the majority under the current voting system must opt for change at next months EGM. In effect, the turkeys must vote for Christmas, to dilute their own power. Will some demand a trade-off to relinquish that privilege? It requires a great leap of faith on all sides. \nPolitics is said to have destroyed the game in the past - but at some point after the Frank Lowy era, there was always going to have to be a period of readjustment, when the running of the sport reverted back to being inclusive of all stakeholders. We are now at that moment. \nIf proper working partnerships can be established between board, clubs, federations and other interest groups, then the game can crack on with the many tasks that require immediate attention. Multiplying the fan base, building infrastructure, expanding the competition(s), capitalising the game, and ultimately, promotion and relegation, a national second division, or both. In a nutshell, the generating of greater interest, content, and a culture of investment & growth, rather than subsistence living. 'I owe the Mariners more' 0:44 \nAs it stands, the current administration seems a little lost as to how to achieve even some of those aims. Time then, to bring the others into the fold, work together, and see how far the shared resources can take us. There is no time to waste, with the other sports on the move into our space, gobbling up precious commercial dollars, media column inches and hearts and minds, emboldened by football’s current inertia. \nThere are endless possibilities for football in Australia. We have a global game with all its riches and connections. We are a part of Asia, developing at a rapid rate, and fuelled by massive Chinese investment. We have participation numbers the other sports can only dream of.
