Mad March a growing force \nThe announcement came one day after the Adelaide Fringe Festival announced a record-breaking 655,541 ticket sales , cementing the festival as the country's largest and Adelaide's overall Mad March festival season as a growing force.

It's out of the ordinary,\" she said. \n\"According to the people who stopped me in the street to talk about the festival, those things have really connected.\" \nThe Secret River broke box office records for the State Theatre Company of SA as the highest grossing and fastest-selling show in the company's history. \nThe festivals within the Adelaide Festival also performed well with Adelaide Writers' Week attracting its biggest crowd of more than 134,000, and WOMADelaide drawing tens of thousands to Botanic Park. \nThe 2017 festival ends tonight with a free party on board the floating Riverbank Palais on River Torrens. \nFestival co-directors Ms Healy and Neil Armfield will continue in the role for the next two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T07:16:08.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
