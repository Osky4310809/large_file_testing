There’s no one thing. There can be aid. It can be – if it was requested up through the governor through the proper channels – that the federal government can provide on a law enforcement basis. But there’s other aid that can be extended as well, either through the U.S. Attorney’s office, or other means that will ensure that the people of Chicago have the resources to feel safe. That’s what he means.” \nMayor Rahm Emanuel met with Trump during the transition in December and Spicer said Trump vowed federal help, if needed. \n“That return call for help has not occurred,” Spicer said. \nAhead of their City Council meeting on Wednesday, several aldermen said they hope Trump was not suggesting he’d order in National Guard troops, as Fox News host Bill O’Reilly suggested on his show on Tuesday, not long before Trump’s tweet about sending in the feds. \n“If I were president, I’d say, ‘You know what? The next month, we’re going to have the Guard in these neighborhoods to stop this,” O’Reilly said. \nEmanuel said he welcomes federal help in fighting crime; if that means more prosecutions for illegal guns, tracking firearms, and boosting jobs and youth programs. However, he said he would oppose any suggestion to bring in the National Guard. \n“As it comes to safety and security, and dealing with gangs and guns, you want the federal resources that are set up to deal with that,” he said. \nThe mayor said that means federal law enforcement agencies – the DEA, FBI and ATF – not troops. \n“The National Guard has nothing to do with public safety” he said. \nAld. Ricardo Munoz (22nd) noted, in the past, Trump has said Chicago could solve its crime problem “in a week” if police were tougher, so he is waiting to find out what Trump meant by threatening to send in the feds. \n“We do need the federal government to come into Chicago a little more aggressively, but not boots. What we need is federal money for housing, federal money for employment training, federal money for mentorship, federal money for new bridges and streets” he said. \nAld. Walter Burnett (27th) echoed that sentiment. \n“I hope when he say he’s going to send in feds that he’s referring to sending in some federal money to deal with all of the other reasons why we have crime in our community. Just policing the issue is not going to solve the issue,” he said. \nAld. Roberto Maldonado (26th) said the federal government also should get involved in helping the Chicago Police Department hire more officers trained in law enforcement. \nAld. Sophia King (4th) said militarizing law enforcement would only exacerbate tensions between police and the public. \n“As I go around to communities, knocking on doors, they’re afraid, and he [Trump] has placed a lot of fear, a lot of needless fear, in people,” she said. “We welcome the federal government, but I think the federal government needs to come with money for jobs.” \nFather Michael Pfleger, a renowned activist priest, said he adamantly opposes using the National Guard to fight crime in Chicago. He said, even if violent crime were to go down with troops on the streets, it would just go back up when they left. \n“You can send in National Guard, which I’m absolutely against, and do a suppression to stop violence, and have a lot of people on the corners for a month or two months. You pull them out, you’re back at ground zero,” \nPfleger said, instead, the Trump administration should focus on providing more federal funding toward economic development, jobs, and education in Chicago. \n“If he’s talking about coming in with federal resources to help support communities with jobs, with education, with businesses, and help equalize the playing field as well as law enforcement to deal with illegal guns and gun trafficking; if you’re talking about the comprehensive approach, fine,” Pfleger said. “We don’t need a big brother to come in and lock everybody up.” \nRev. Jesse Jackson also spoke out against Trump’s threat on Twitter. We need a plan, not a threat. We need jobs, not jails. #Chicago", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:28:03.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
