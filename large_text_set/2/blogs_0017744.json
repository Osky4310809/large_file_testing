The butter is an offshoot of Snow Brand Coffee, a decades-old packaged drink that pre-mixes milk into the coffee, and the spread will land on store shelves in early March. (Sadly, it’ll only be available in Japan, so for now, you’ll have to settle for the sugar rush of Marshmallow Fluff with your breakfast toast.) • The James Beard Foundation has announced the host for its 2017 Awards Gala, taking place May 1 at the Lyric Opera in Chicago: Modern Family star (and onetime Broadway restaurant receptionist ) Jesse Tyler Ferguson will act as master of ceremonies for the Restaurant and Chef Awards ( check out the list of semifinalists here ). Meanwhile, Bizarre Foods host Andrew Zimmern will host the JBF Media Awards, which take place in New York City on April 25. • Two chain updates from the world of local Business Journal reporting: 1) Outback Steakhouse is experimenting with delivering Bloomin’ Onions directly to your door, testing both in-house and third-party delivery services in the Tampa Bay market. 2) Wendy’s-branded sodas could soon be a thing , as early test runs of Dave’s Cherry Cream Soda, named for Wendy’s founder Dave Thomas, have been a success, suggesting an larger roll-out of the proprietary fountain drink might be forthcoming. • Who gets the own the story of pizza in America?

And it kills me .” • Food trucks have finally arrived in Hong Kong — all eight of them. The New York Times chronicles the bureaucratic wrangling necessary for the city to welcome its first miniature fleet of food trucks (which, by law, are stationary and not actually able to roam the streets). • Anthony Bourdain is still publicly needling President Donald Trump, both by calling out Trump’s bizarre Sweden comments and tweeting some images that would not make POTUS happy. • Food historian John T. Edge shines a light upon two worthy po’boy restaurants for the next time you’re in Louisiana: Read up on the charms of Bon Creole in New Iberia and Pop’s Poboys in nearby Lafayette. • Fun fact of the day: Angelina Jolie is adept at tarantula-cooking . • New York City’s “truffle king” is this 24-year-old kid: Can't get enough of Eater?
