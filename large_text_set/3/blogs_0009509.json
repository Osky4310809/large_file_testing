Tarte Just Launched a Limited-Edition Vegan Dry Shampoo \nDevotees of Tarte know that the brand has been offering eco-friendly makeup formulas for ages now, and in recent years, expanded into body and skin care. Like its product predecessors, the items are high quality — and often vegan! — making them must haves in any beauty babe's bag. Now Tarte is quietly entering the hair care category, and we're completely psyched. \nAmongst its new launches for the season, the brand debuted a limited-edition dry shampoo called Hair Goals. According to the Tarte site, the hair formula features natural thickeners and conditioners that are in its mascaras (including cellulose and rice bran wax), which add volume, lift, and hold at the root. The microfine powder blends into all hair colors — including rainbow, if the above image is any indication — and refreshes strands with a clean, sexy scent. And, best of all, it's vegan, too! \nBased on the fun neon packaging, we wouldn't be surprised if this was an (albeit temporary) extension of Tarte's athleisure collection , which launched late last year wrapped in similar punchy shades. Keep reading to see more shots of this new launch and shop it, but act fast, because once it's gone, it's gone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:22:12.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
