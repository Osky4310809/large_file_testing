Qualcomm has signed agreements with those manufacturers, which the company expects to continue to uphold, though Qualcomm president Derek Eberle said the company would have to take a “wait-and-see” approach for the future. \n“We would expect and hope that our licensees will continue to comply with their agreements and Apple will not interfere with those contractual agreements in place,” Aberle said on the call. “We obviously can’t control their actions down the road so we’ll have to see how that develops.” \nApple recently filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm over the terms for its technology. Qualcomm’s tactics have also been the subject of charges from the FTC . The company is one of the largest chip providers for smartphones — such as the Snapdragon processor — and relies on huge manufacturers like Apple for a major part of their business.

Following the initial legal disputes, Qualcomm’s stock took a very sharp dive. The company now faces a potentially huge roadblock for its core business, which saw some positive signs in its first-quarter earnings report as shipments of 3G and 4G devices were up 8 percent. \n“If you peel apart all the arguments that Apple is making, we believe firmly that they’re all without merit, at the end of the day they want to pay less for the technology that they’re using,” Aberle said. “It’s pretty simple. That’s the motivation, again they wrap a lot of stuff around that, which we think over time we will be able to clearly show is false. But in the end of the day they want to get to a lower payment. We think that’s not appropriate given the value we’ve established.” FindTheCompany | Graphiq \nWall street was looking for Qualcomm to deliver earnings of about $1.18 per share on $6.12 billion in revenue, while the company said it earned $1.19 per share on $5.99 billion in revenue. While the results came out a little mixed, the legal battle between Apple and Qualcomm continues to have a big shadow over Qualcomm’s future. \n“We have a long history of successfully defending our licensing and practices business model, which have been tested around the globe,” Mollenkopf said. We are very excited about the future and many opportunities directly in front of us. I am confident we will address and get through the legal challenges underway as we have done many times in the past.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:55:00.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
