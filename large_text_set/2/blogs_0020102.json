Shulkin was nominated by President Trump to serve as the ninth Secretary of Veterans Affairs, was confirmed by the United States Senate on Feb. 13, and was sworn into office on Feb. 14. Prior to his confirmation as Secretary, Shulkin served as VA’s Under Secretary for Health for 18 months, leading the nation’s largest integrated health care system, with more than 1,700 sites of care serving nearly nine million Veterans.\nTo engage Veterans directly, Shulkin and other VA senior leaders will join moderator Bill Rausch for a 30-minute discussion online via YouTube live.\nBill Rausch, executive director of Got Your 6, will serve as moderator for the YouTube live discussion on Feb. 24 at 2:45 p.m. ET.\n“Over the last year and a half I’ve gotten to know Secretary Shulkin as man of great integrity and passion, who is committed to putting Veterans first,” said Rausch, an Army Veteran and executive director of Got Your 6 . “I’m thrilled that my fellow Veterans will get to see where his dedication to service comes from and ask questions about his vision for leading and reforming the department.”\nDesigned as a virtual “town hall” meeting, the YouTube Live event is the first social media event Shulkin will participate in since being sworn in as secretary. He will answer questions from Veterans and others in the community submitted in advance, as well as those posted live during the chat.\n“Since 2006, YouTube has played a significant role in connecting the American people with their governments and elected officials,” said Brandon Feldman with YouTube News and Politics. “We’re pleased Secretary Shulkin is continuing this tradition and we’re looking forward to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ efforts to engage constituents through technology.”\nThe YouTubeLive discussion is one of several events over the next few weeks where Shulkin will meet directly with Veterans, Veterans service organizations, state Veterans Affairs directors, as well as VA employees to highlight the progress VA is making in delivering the care and services Veterans need and deserve.\n“Among many critical efforts already underway, we will continue building on significant progress increasing access for Veterans, preventing suicide, addressing unique needs of women Veterans, supporting Veterans’ families and caregivers, continuing to drive down the disability backlog and Veteran homelessness, and pursuing necessary legislation to reform the outdated appeals process and for other critical legislative priorities,” Shulkin recently shared .\n“When VA succeeds, Veterans succeed, and we look forward to a positive, collaborative relationship with Secretary Shulkin as he works to transform VA into agency that supports and empowers every Veteran across America,” Rausch said.\nTo participate in the event on Friday, tune in to our YouTube Live event page – click here – or watch via VA’s Facebook page at 2:45 p.m. ET.
