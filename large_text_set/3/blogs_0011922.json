There's a brand new smart sex toy for you.\nThe Fleshlight Launch is billed as a “fully automated male masturbator\" and is designed for use with your favorite Fleshlight. Not to be confused with the LaunchPAD iPad case, this new standalone device was unveiled at SXSW on Saturday.\nBasically you put the Fleshlight of your choice into The Launch. In manual mode, you can use its touch controls to adjust the speed, length and position of your stroke. In interactive mode, you sync The Launch to your computer or mobile via Bluetooth and opt for it to perform whatever kind of adult content floats your boat — you can even have a VR experience.\nBefore you get too, um, excited at this prospect, it's worth noticing what a massive and clunky setup this is. It’s a foot tall and six inches wide! (No word on how much it weighs.) It also costs $200.\nSure, it has a very sleek design, but it really looks more like something a wine enthusiast would use to chill a bottle of their finest Sauvignon blanc than something you’d want to f*ck.\nCertainly throughout history men have stuck their members into far weirder things, but it remains to be seen if the horny masses will fork over hundreds of dollars for this unwieldy contraption.\nWATCH: This device could help men be better in bed", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Q_nnB3nQaA5WBBZmAK6z5Aav9K4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F415150%2F4c9df868-b96f-497a-9cb2-6856ad805f94.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/4N9ZRaCC.m3u8", "http://www.kiiroo.com/product/launch-fleshlight/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0MwzNIsE_neB-XKMfzXugewNpX0=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F415150%2F4c9df868-b96f-497a-9cb2-6856ad805f94.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/4N9ZRaCC.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-15T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T18:59:27.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
