I’m originally from a small city called Kaniv, located in the middle of Ukraine. I’ve been based in the capital of Ukraine, Kiev, for the last 10 years for now. \nGiven that I graduated as Master of Laws (that was my main education), I can call myself a self taught designer. I’m sure, it is one of the best types of education one can get :)   \nFor the recent few years I’ve been working for big international companies, which means I’ve had just as big projects that are mostly under NDA agreement. \nCurrently I’m employed as Senior Interactive Designer at SoftServe working on the huge customer portal in the healthcare field. Its MVP is supposed to be released in a few month from now, after that I can talk more about it. \nAside from that, I have my own, unsolicited project called “ Interaction Library ,” which is basically the suite of the most interesting examples of human-machine interaction.

This pattern helps users unload their cognitive memory (one of the most limited human resources). It sets the ground for future observations and improvements in UX field that I’m really passionate about. Tell us about your setup. What tools did you use to create the shot (e.g. hardware, software, pens, paper, blowtorch)? \nI own a MacBook 15-inch with Retina display that is perfect for both working at home, office, or carrying around while traveling. I have a bunch of mobile devices for real-time testing of my design assumptions. I do a lot of sketching, so I carry my notebook around. Also I have no idea what i would do without my 34-inch monitor, as I also like to mess with some timelines and keyframes as well. Choose a favorite shot from another player.
