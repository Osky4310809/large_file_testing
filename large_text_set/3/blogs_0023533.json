Shutterstock\nNote: This article contains general information — not specific medical advice. Talk to your physician before changing your use of any medication.\nGrapefruit is a delicious citrus fruit with many health benefits .\nHowever, it can interact with some common medications, altering their effects on your body.\nIf you're curious about the grapefruit warning on many medicines, this article will help you understand why it's there and what your options are.\nHere's a closer look at 32 common drugs that may have dangerous interactions with grapefruit.\nView As: One Page Slides How does it interact with medications? Shutterstock Medications are processed in your liver and small intestine by a specialized group of proteins called cytochrome P450 (CYPs).\nCYPs break down medications, reducing the blood levels of many of them.\nGrapefruit and a few of its close relatives, such as Seville oranges, tangelos, pomelos and Minneolas, contain a class of chemicals called furanocoumarins .\nFuranocoumarins disrupt the normal function of CYPs. In fact, studies show that they increase the blood levels of over 85 medications ( 1 ).\nBy slowing down the way in which CYPs normally break down medications in your gut and liver, grapefruit can increase the side effects of these drugs ( 1 ).\nThere are three things to know in order to understand if and how you can safely consume grapefruit with these medications.\nIt doesn’t take much: One whole grapefruit or one glass of grapefruit juice is enough to alter how these medications affect you. It lasts several days: Grapefruit’s ability to affect medication lasts for 1–3 days. Taking your medication a few hours apart from consuming it isn’t long enough. It’s significant: For a small number of drugs, grapefruit’s effects can be serious. With that in mind, here is detailed information about 32 common medications that may interact with grapefruit, categorized by use.\nSome cholesterol medications Shutterstock Some cholesterol medications called statins are affected by grapefruit.\nStatins work by limiting the natural production of cholesterol. This improves the profile of lipoproteins in the blood and decreases deaths from heart disease in patients at risk of it ( 2 ).\nStatins can cause rhabdomyolysis , or the breakdown of muscle tissue. This leads to muscle weakness, pain and occasionally kidney damage ( 3 ).\nGrapefruit increases the blood levels of three common statins substantially, increasing the risk of rhabdomyolysis ( 4 ):\nAtorvastatin Lovastatin Simvastatin One study showed that drinking a glass of grapefruit juice with simvastatin or lovastatin increased blood levels of these statins by 260% ( 5 ).\nSummary: Grapefruit can increase the side effects of some statin cholesterol medications, causing muscle damage.\nCertain blood pressure medications Joe Raedle/Getty Images Most types of blood pressure medicine are not affected by grapefruit.\nHowever, the following four blood pressure medications should be used cautiously:\nFelodipine Nifedipine Losartan Eplerenone The first two medications in this list are known as calcium channel blockers. They work by changing the way your blood vessels use calcium, relaxing the vessels and relieving blood pressure.\nThe last two medications in this list work by decreasing the activity of a hormone called angiotensin 2, which naturally increases blood pressure.\nOne study found blood levels of nifedipine increased dramatically when taken with about 2 cups (500 ml) of grapefruit juice, compared to no juice. This resulted in a rapid drop in blood pressure, which could be dangerous if unsupervised ( 6 ).\nLosartan is unusual in that its effects decrease — instead of increase — with grapefruit. This may limit its ability to control blood pressure ( 7 ).\nEplerenone works similarly to losartan, but its levels increase when taken with grapefruit. Excessive eplerenone levels can cause too much potassium in the blood, which can interfere with heart rhythm ( 1 ).\nSummary: Though grapefruit does not interfere with most blood pressure medications, it can cause a few medications to over-correct blood pressure.\nA few heart rhythm medications Pixabay via Google Images Grapefruit influences a few medications that treat abnormal heart rhythms.\nThese interactions can be particularly dangerous, and include:\nAmiodarone Dronedarone A study gave a glass of grapefruit juice (about 300 ml) to 11 men taking amiodarone. Drug levels increased by up to 84%, compared to those not drinking the juice ( 9 ).\nThese two medications play a critical role in managing the health of patients with heart rhythm disorders. Grapefruit-related changes in levels of these drugs have occasionally caused dangerous heart rhythm changes ( 10 ).\nSummary: Although only a few heart rhythm medications interact with grapefruit, the side effects can be dangerous.\nSome anti-infection medications National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)/Flickr Collectively called antimicrobials, these anti-infection medications vary widely in their actions and breakdown in the body.\nAlthough antimicrobials are one of the most diverse categories of medications, there are only a few medications with known important grapefruit interactions:\nErythromycin Rilpivirine and related HIV drugs Primaquine and related antimalarial drugs Albendazole Erythromycin is used to treat several types of bacterial infections. A study comparing grapefruit juice to water in patients taking erythromycin showed that the juice increased the drug’s blood levels by 84% ( 11 ).\nExcess levels of this medication can disrupt heart rhythm ( 11 ).\nLevels of the HIV medications rilpivirine and maraviroc, in addition to primaquine-related antimalarial drugs, are also increased by grapefruit. This may affect heart rhythm or function ( 1 ).\nBecause antimicrobials are generally taken for a limited time, perhaps it’s easiest to simply avoid grapefruit while taking these medications.\nSummary: Some anti-infection medications should not be used with grapefruit, as they can lead to disrupted heart rhythm or function.\nSeveral mood medications Vici Arif Wicaksono/Shutterstock Most antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs are safe to use with grapefruit.\nHowever, several mood medications do interact with it, including:\nBupropion Quetiapine Lurasidone Ziprasidone Buspirone Diazepam Midazolam Triazolam In addition to being an antidepressant, bupropion is prescribed to help people quit smoking. Its blood levels increase with grapefruit, which can increase dizziness and sleepiness ( 1 ).\nDrugs like quetiapine and lurasidone are used to treat mood and behavioral disorders. Increased levels of these drugs can cause heart rhythm changes or sleepiness ( 1 ).\nFurthermore, diazepam, midazolam and triazolam are sedatives that are sometimes used for panic attacks or other forms of anxiety.\nOne study compared some of these drugs in nine patients with and without grapefruit. It showed that grapefruit can increase these drugs’ effects, resulting in excessive drowsiness ( 12 ).\nSummary: Eating grapefruit while taking the mood-related medications above can result in heart rhythm changes, excessive sleepiness and other drug-specific effects.\nCertain blood thinners EmiliaUngur/shutterstock Blood thinners are used to treat or prevent blood clots. Some of them are affected by grapefruit, including:\nApixaban Rivaroxaban Clopidogrel Ticagrelor Clopidogrel depends on CYPs — the proteins that grapefruit limits — to work. Thus, it becomes less active when mixed with grapefruit.\nA study of seven patients taking clopidogrel with 200 ml of either grapefruit juice or water showed lower activation of the drug with the juice. However, its ability to treat blood clots was not affected ( 13 ).\nContrarily, grapefruit increases the blood levels of other medications on this list, which can result in bleeding ( 14 ).\nSummary: Several blood thinners are affected by grapefruit. This can lead to bleeding or less effective prevention of blood clots.\nSeveral pain medications frankieleon/flickr Multiple pain medications are affected by grapefruit:\nFentanyl Oxycodone Colchicine Fentanyl and oxycodone are narcotic pain relievers. Although their blood levels are only slightly affected by small amounts of grapefruit, it may change the length of time they remain in the body ( 16 , 17 ).\nColchicine is an older medication used to treat gout. It is processed by CYPs and could potentially interact with grapefruit. Nevertheless, a 2012 study showed that drinking 240 ml of grapefruit juice only had a minimal effect on its levels ( 18 ).\nSummary: Some narcotic pain relievers persist longer in the blood when taken with grapefruit.\nA few erectile dysfunction and prostate medications mariadelajuana/Flickr A few erectile dysfunction and prostate medications deserve attention regarding grapefruit interactions:\nSildenafil Tadalafil Tamsulosin Silodosin Erectile dysfunction medications like sildenafil and tadalafil work by relaxing blood vessels, which increases blood flow to an erection.\nBecause other blood vessels relax with these medications as well, increased blood levels of these drugs caused by grapefruit can decrease blood pressure ( 8 ).\nMoreover, prostate enlargement medications such as tamsulosin can also cause increased dizziness and low blood pressure when taken with grapefruit ( 19 ).\nSummary: Grapefruit should not be consumed with erectile dysfunction medications or certain prostate enlargement medications.\nShould you give up grapefruit? Flickr/calliope While this article lists 32 common medications that interact with grapefruit, it is not a complete list.\nDrugs.com offers a drug interaction checker that you can use to check your medications for interactions.\nAdditionally, Rxlist.com lists some less common medications that also interact with grapefruit.\nIt’s important to remember that just one whole grapefruit or about one large glass of juice is enough to change the blood levels of many drugs. And some of these medications may have serious side effects when they interact with grapefruit.\nIf you are currently taking medications with grapefruit interactions, switch to an alternative drug or stop consuming grapefruit.\nIf in doubt, reach out to your doctor or pharmacist for personalized advice.\nSummary: Even small amounts of grapefruit can interact with some medications and cause serious side effects.\nThe bottom line Shutterstock Grapefruit interferes with proteins in the small intestine and liver that normally break down many medications.\nEating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice while taking these medications can lead to higher levels in your blood — and more side effects.\nWith some drugs, with even small amounts of grapefruit can cause severe side effects. Therefore, the combination should be avoided.\nThese drugs may be marked with a grapefruit interaction warning by your pharmacy.\nMake sure your doctor and pharmacist know if you regularly consume grapefruit. They can help you decide whether it’s safe to consume while on certain medications.\nRead the original article on Authority Nutrition . Copyright 2017.
