You just want more and more of it. \n“You improve as a player and a person. I learnt a lot because I was playing with great players. \n“I remember thinking, 'I’m training against Lampard, Gerrard and Rooney, this is a massive standard.' The way they worked was world class. It was an unbelievable feeling.” \nIt is the reason why he understands the decision of players such as Lallana to move on. \n“You look at where they have gone and they have done really well,” said Rodriguez.

It was an amazing experience for myself with England.” \nClaude Puel's Saints go into Wednesday's semi-final first leg as underdogs despite playing at home, having lost three of their last four games and drawn the other. \nThey will also be without Jose Fonte, one of their best two defenders and the club captain, as his transfer wrangle continues.

It was really nice to speak with him and reminisce. \n“He just wanted to improve you as a player and a person. He always spoke to you and helped out. He was always seeing things in your game that you were weak at, but he also gave you that belief that you are a good player.” \nRodriguez intends to prove as much in this semi-final. poll loading Who will reach the EFL Cup final? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:45:14.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
