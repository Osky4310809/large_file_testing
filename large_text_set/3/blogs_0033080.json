Eleven-year-olds Mara and Lara Bawar were born with albinism , a rare genetic condition that causes depigmentation in the hair, skin, and eyes, the Daily Mail reports. Though their parents hail from Guinea Bissau in West Africa, both girls are paper-white due to their condition, with white-blonde hair and light eyes. After discovering them in a video, Terranova decided to hire them as models to feature in his book Flores Raras , or Rare Flowers. Since then, the twins, along with their older sister Sheila, have modeled for major brands, including Nike and Bazaar Kids.

A beauty that is not that uncommon, but rather rarely perceived while out there every day, ready to be noticed and given its deserved spotlight.\" Vinicius Terranova Though young, the twins, who say they \"feel albinism is pretty,\" hope to use their unique beauty to their advantage as models, representing both albinism and black women in an industry known for its diversity issues. Mara explained: \"Growing up [with albinism] was amazing, we love being different and are happy with our unique beauty.\" The twins' older sister, 13-year-old Sheila — who does not have albinism, but models with her sisters all the same — added her feelings about the industry in general, saying: \"We love [modeling]. We are very expressive and creative. It feels wonderful to put this out there, to communicate with people who identify with our work. We like to see our beauty being valued by its unique aspects.\" Loading View on Instagram The trio, who live with their parents in Sao Paolo, Brazil, recently launched an Instagram account to document their modeling work. Already, they've amassed nearly 5,000 followers, and are frequently praised for helping to increase diversity and representation in the fashion industry. They may be just starting out as models, but it’s a safe bet these three are in it for the long haul. Love this?
