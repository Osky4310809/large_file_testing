Michael Uriely was a national chess champion (PA) \nExpert respiratory paediatrician Dr Richard Iles said the Westminster Under School pupil's death was preventable and he should have been referred to a specialist. \nHe said there were a number of clear signs that the care programme was not working months earlier. \nMichael was taken to the Royal Free Hospital on August 18 after he suffered violent coughing and vomiting fits which left him struggling to breathe but he was discharged at 8pm the same day. \nHis parents rushed him back to A&E after he suffered another severe attack during the early hours of the morning on August 19. \nHe was kept in overnight before being sent home again the following day. \nThe Royal Free Hospital carried out two internal investigations after Michael's death and concluded that staff failed to diagnose him with chronic asthma and the care he was given was not adequate. \nThe hospital has since appointed two specialist respiratory clinicians, opened a dedicated asthma clinic and implemented a new strategy for treating children with asthma. Michael's mother said she was \"devastated beyond words\" following his death \nMichael died from an acute asthma attack, the coroner ruled. \nMrs Uriely, 52, said was \"devastated beyond words\" about the loss of her son, a national chess champion who she described as \"highly gifted\". \nShe said before the inquest: “Michael was an extraordinary boy, both in personality and intelligence, who came to us after four gruelling years of fertility treatment. \n“He doted on his younger twin sisters, who adored him, and always joined in with their games. \n\"Now we would just like answers as to why he died.” \nHe was diagnosed with asthma when he was two-and-a-half years old and began learning how to play chess around six months later, competing at local, regional and then national level as he grew up.
