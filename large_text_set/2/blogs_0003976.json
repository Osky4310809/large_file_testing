Here is when we’ll be stronger, when you’re in this situation that you’re out of the conference. Here is where we’ll build trust in each other. So I hope the good things we had, we’ll take it to the next conference,” Yap said. Yap ended his first conference with the Elasto Painters on Sunday with a 98-91 loss to San Miguel. ADVERTISEMENT But rather than be down, Yap is looking at this shortcoming as a turning point for him and the squad as Rain or Shine hopes to shrug off the cobwebs and bounce back stronger in the import-laden conferences. “This will be the start. That’s how basketball is. Sometimes, it’s still not your time.” The two-time PBA Most Valuable Player also shared that he believes that slowly, he’s getting into the Elasto Painters’ groove, saying, “Until now, there’s still an adjustment.” Yap averaged 10.7 points, 2.9 rebounds, and 1.4 assists in his first conference with Rain or Shine, but don’t be fooled, as he eyes to further blend in with the team’s core after the team’s short offseason break. “There were times that I still get lost. It’s not going to be one click, and I’m already ok. But I’m getting there, so hopefully next conference, I can finally get it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:31:08.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
