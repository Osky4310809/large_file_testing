By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 19, 2017 10:36 AM Harjeet Singh is the new Aam Aadmi party candidate from Rajouri Garden. (Source; IE image) \nThe losses in Punjab and Goa have forced the top brass of Aam Aadmi Party to reconsider their strategy for the future elections. With a little more than a month left for the Delhi Municipal CCorporationElections, the party is taking some strict decisions against its senior members. In the latest development, one of party’s old loyalists in west Delhi, Harjeet Singh has been named as the candidate for the upcoming Rajouri Garden by polls. Harjeet joined the Anna Hazare Movement in 2013 and is a popular face at the Bangla Sahib Gurdwara. \nHe was holding the post of party’s Vidhan Sabha president in Hari Nagar and even after that was very active at the ground level. “Despite his high-ranking position, he has been an ardent volunteer at the Bangla Sahib Gurdwara…,” a senior leader said. AAP has made an image of fielding its candidate way too early but in this year’s MCD polls there has been a reversal of fortunes for the party. \nYou may also want to watch: \nIt has found itself in a bit of jeopardy to finalise the names and the west Delhi seat fell vacant after sitting AAP MLA Jarnail Singh resigned to take on Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal in Lambi. Even though the major reason behind it is believed to be his lack of funds to contest another election, reports also suggest that there have been question marks on his winnability. \n“The flip-flop would not have gone down well with local voters, who might feel he abandoned his constituency for a bigger responsibility in Punjab. Also, it is a genuine technical problem. There was very little time for him to shift his voter registration back,” said a party functionary. Another close source to him told the Indian Express, “He is a modest journalist and does not have so much money to contest yet another election. Over the past three years, he has contested three polls — the Lok Sabha polls in 2014, the Assembly polls in 2015 and now the Punjab polls.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T07:19:30.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
