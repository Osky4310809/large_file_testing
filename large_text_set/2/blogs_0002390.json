Philip Pizzo, 67, who practices in the Diocese of Brooklyn, posted the #JumpAgainstTrump meme on his personal Facebook page Sunday, said he thought the slogan was “funny” and insisted it was not intended to promote suicide. \n“ I do not promote suicide ,’’ said Pizzo to the NY Post. “I’ve helped many people over the years, and it does not promote suicide. It was funny .” \nFollowing a barrage of hate from parishioners and the public, Pizzo posted an apology on Facebook Tuesday, explaining that he regrets posting the “c ompletely inappropriate ” meme. \n“ I apologize for the hurt that I have caused over a Facebook post ,” he reportedly wrote. \n“ I never intended it to get this kind of reaction and I regret posting it. I have been a priest for 40 years and my goal has always been to bring Christ to the people. I am pro-life and any reference to suicide is contrary to my beliefs, therefore, making my post completely inappropriate. Again, please accept my sincerest apology .” \nREAD MORE: Drink or boycott?
