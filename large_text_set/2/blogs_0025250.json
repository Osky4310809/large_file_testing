The film stars Naomi Harris as the boy’s drug-addicted mother, and Mahershala Ali as a drug dealer-turned mentor for the boy.\n“Moonlight” has provided some of the stiffest competition during Hollywood’s awards season for the musical “La La Land,” which was nominated for a history-tying 14 Academy Awards.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:23:53.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
