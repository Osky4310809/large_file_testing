Fans of the hilarious car wash scene will be glad to hear that Ross and Gucci will be filming a full-length movie together later this year.\"Me and Guwop gonna film our first movie,\" Ross told V103 Live, indicating that the upcoming film would be shot in Gucci's hometown of Atlanta. \"We doin' that independently. We gonna begin that in the next 3 months. That's coming, that's official. They gonna see us swerving.\" His comments can be found at the 4:30 mark. \nNo word on what the concept behind the movie is, but honestly, a full-length development of the car wash characters would definitely be worth a watch. May they could even bring out Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg to cameo as their characters from \"The Wash.\"We'd like to think this tweet with 50k RTs influenced their decision just a little bit. Gucci and Ross are not bad actors AT ALL.... This would make a great scene in a southern comedy lol pic.twitter.com/ld9G5qcqdj", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:58:00.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
