Facebook \nSkylar continued: “Weed is not good for you, because weed is stuff that is grass but it’s not grass because it’s weed.” \nTrying to confirm that he doesn’t in fact grow weed, Holt added: “Do you want to explain and show us what you mean?” \nHis daughter nodded and headed outside into the garden, pointing to weeds in the grass and by the paving slabs. Facebook \n“Oh that, that’s the weed you are talking about?” the dad said. \n“Yep, and here, and here,” (and so on while she points out the weeds in the garden). \nWell that cleared that up then. \nHolt shared the video on Facebook with the caption: “My child’s teacher: ‘So Skylar tells me you guys have a ton of weed at home’. \n“Me: ‘Umm’, Teacher: ‘She said you’re growing it’, Me: ____.” \nHolt’s video had been viewed more than 70,000 times in five days.
