In this unnamed city, suspended somewhere between the past, the present, and the future, text messages and one hour of daily internet connection link Nadia and Saeed with the world beyond a home that is disintegrating day by day.

When Lucy and Owen's friends reveal that they're giving open marriage a shot at a boozy dinner party, Lucy shudders at the thought.

In 1975, he and his family came to The United States as refugees in the wake of the Vietnam War. His debut novel, The Sympathizer , winner of last year's Pulitzer Prize, revisited the conflict that changed the trajectory of his life and inserted a much-needed Vietnamese perspective to the largely American-driven narrative. In The Refugees , a collection of stories 20 years in the making, he gives voice to the Vietnamese communities in Southern California (where he grew up) and to those living in the country he fled, acknowledging that the ghosts of war reverberate for generations.

When Saunders discovered that a grief-stricken Abraham Lincoln repeatedly visited his 11-year-old son's crypt in the days following his death in February 1862, he couldn't get the image of the grieving father out of his mind. What results is a playful and poignant supernatural wonder of a novel. Unfolding over the one night Lincoln inhabits the \"bardo,\" the transitional place between life and death according to Tibetan tradition, Lincoln is surrounded by ghosts past and present. These ghosts are sexy, rude, naughty, haughty and shocking. (The 166-member, start-studded cast of the audio book might give you a hint of what's in store: Julianne Moore, Susan Sarandon, Nick Offerman, David Sedaris, Carrie Brownstein, Miranda July, Lena Dunham, Jeffrey Tambor, Don Cheadle, Patrick Wilson, and Ben Stiller all lend their voices to the recording.) Most Popular Abandon Me by Melissa Febos Anyone who has read Febos's memoir Whip Smart —about her four years working as a professional dominatrix at a midtown Manhattan \"dungeon\" while in grad school—knows that her work explores boundaries as deftly as it defies categorization. In this new collection of essays, she once again obliterates convention with her erotically charged and intellectually astute recollections of family, relationships and the search for identity. In Abandon Me , Febos interrogates what it means to be the product of an aloof sea captain and a psychotherapist, how the mysteries of her childhood shaped her, and how pain, addiction, and the need for human connection forged in her such deep desires and longings. Running by Cara Hoffman In the 1980s, teenager Cara Hoffman ditched college and took off for Europe, occasionally sleeping in train stations and stowing away in Venetian water taxis. Just as her funds were running dangerously low, she heard about a place she could crash and earn a small commission working as a \"runner\" in Greece—that is, walking the length of trains and luring in unsuspecting tourists to the seedy hotels in the red-light district of Athens. Running , the novel inspired by these experiences, explores the dark, alluring intersections between love and survival. When Hoffman's three young protagonists unwittingly become involved in an act of terrorism, the bonds they've formed are irreversibly fractured and each must deal with the cost. Pachinko by Min Jin Lee Thirty years in the making, Lee's sweeping, multi-generational novel is set in 1900s Asia and is informed by stories she heard about legal and social discrimination against Koreans in Japan, a history largely denied and erased. This story kicks off with an unplanned pregnancy and the promise of a less shameful life in Japan and evolves into addictive family saga packed with forbidden love, the search for belonging, and triumph against the odds.
