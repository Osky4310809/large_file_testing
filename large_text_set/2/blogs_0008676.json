Konstantin Kosachev \n\"Either Mr Trump has not gained the requisite independence and he is consequently being not unsuccessfully backed into a corner, or Russophobia has already infected the new administration also from top to bottom,\" Mr Kosachev wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. \nM r Kosachev argued that Mr Flynn’s public remarks suggested he was no friend of Russia, but unlike many US officials was “open to dialogue.” \n“Even that is perceived in Washington as a thought crime,” Mr Kosachev wrote. \nL eonid Slutsky, Mr Kosachevs counterpart in the State Duma, Russia’s lower house, said Mr Flynn had been forced to resign to undermine relations with Russia. \n“The situation around Michael Flynn’s ousting as national security advisor has a provocative character,” Mr Slutsky said. \n“Of course, it leads us to the conclusion that the real target was Russian-American relations and undermining trust in the new administration,” he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nHe said Mr Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador in Washington amounted to “normal diplomatic practice.” \nMr Flynn resigned as Donald Trump’s national security advisor after admitting to misleading Mike Pence, the vice president, about telephone conversations with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington. \nThe conversations, which took place before he became national security advisor, have been described as \"potentially illegal\" due to the 1799 Logan Act, which bans private US citizens from negotiating with countries with which the US is in dispute. \nDmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Vladimir Putin, on Monday denied Mr Flynn and Mr Kislyak discussed sanctions during the phone calls. \nThe Kremlin has not commented further since Mr Flynn tendered his resignation.
