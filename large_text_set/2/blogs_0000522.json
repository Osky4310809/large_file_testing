For that matter, why not keep the secret until the babies were born? \nAccording to a source speaking with Us Weekly , Bey dropped the announcement as late as she possibly could. \nWhy? One word: Grammys . The source said: \n\"She announced it this way before Grammy fittings and rehearsals, as she knew it would get out. She couldn't repeat the same debut on the show like the [2011] VMAs and didn't want it to take away from her Grammy wins and performance.\" \nIn that Love On Top performance (which you can watch in its entirety HERE btw), Bey opened her jacket to confirm her pregnancy for everyone. \nWhy not duplicate it? The insider said: \n\"She wants Grammy night to be about celebrating the album and her work. Now she can get ready and perform on Grammy night without all the attention going to this.\" \nThe Grammys ceremony is coming soon on February 12. Something tells us Lemonade will still get PLENTY of attention! \nDo YOU think Beyoncé should have kept the secret until the Grammys??", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:51:25.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
