Barton clashes with a Lincoln player on the pitch (Photo: REUTERS) Barton opens his mouth again (Photo: REUTERS) Joey Barton slams...Neymar \nAh, the old tactic for going after someone who is infinitely better than you in the hope of bringing them down a few pegs. \nBarton attempted to savage Barcelona, then at Santos, star Neymar in a bitter and twisted tweet - likening him to popstar/hate figure Justin Bieber. \nHe almost immediately regretted it when fans leaped to the trickster's defence and eventually backed down and ate his words. \"Show pony\" Neymar (Photo: Michael Regan) \nThe insult even made its way to the Brazilian magician who gave the comeback to end all come backs - “I don’t know who he is.\" \nWhat Barton said: \"Neymar is the Justin Bieber of football. Brilliant on the old You Tube. Cat piss in reality...I wouldn't pay the £40-50million there asking for Neymar. Not a chance #showpony\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Antonio Conte doesn't know who Joey Barton is Share this video Joey Barton slams...Gareth Southgate \"Baffling appointment\" Southgate (Photo: PA) \nBarton was very clearly not on the charm offensive for an England recall, to build on his solitary cap, when he called out Gareth Southgate. \nBarely hours after Southgate had been announced by the FA as Sam Allardyce's replacement in the Wembley hotseat our man Barton was already at it. \nIn fairness to Barton he tries very hard to avoid slamming his target, but that somehow makes the insult more hurtful. \nWe're not sure Barton will put on the Three Lions ever again. \nWhat Barton said: “I think in England we’re really struggling for an identity for what we do \n“Now we’ve gotta have an Englishman as manager and, I’m not criticising Southgate, but he did okay initially at Middlesbrough and a bit of an apprenticeship with the England Under-21s and so forth. \n“I’m just baffled by how he’s the England manager if that’s the pinnacle of our football.” Joey Barton slams...Roy Hodgson \"Boring\" Hodgson (Photo: PA) \nSouthgate was not the first Three Lions boss to feel the full force of Barton's tongue. \nOh no, even uncle Roy found himself on the receiving end of a Barton special. \nApparently the way the manager looks, and not the hours of training ground preparations, is the reason England are in the midst of 51 years of hurt. Who knew? \nThe two roasts begs the question, who would Joey have as England manager? We're not sure they would go for him especially with the current ban hanging over his head. \nWhat Barton said: \"He's not a leader. You wouldn't follow him, would you?\" \n\"He's not energetic. He's not someone you look at and think: 'Wow, I'd love to play for this guy!' He doesn't give you that feeling. He looks boring. He looks like he'd drain the energy out of you because he is a worrier. \n\" Compare him to Jose Mourinho. If Mourinho was managing England then we'd have won that game comfortably the other night. So, yes, I really do worry about England.\" Joey Barton slams...Raheem Sterling \"Technically limited\" Sterling (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) \nA common theme here is Barton does not like small nimble footed footballers, first Neymar was in for some stick and then Kante bore the brunt. \nSo it comes as no surprise Raheem Sterling is not pinned up above Barton's bed. \nThe speedy Manchester City winger doesn't have much more to add than his explosive pace despite his 43 career goals by the age of 22. \nWhat Barton said: “Raheem Sterling has been poor for two years now. \n\"Unfortunately, he has not been coached well enough. If you take away his pace, he is really weak, very limited technically. \n\"With his final ball, he is imprecise or clumsy. Without his pace, would he be a professional? If he weren't so quick, he would not be apt to do the job. And to think he cost £50m! \n\"I am really perplexed to see him in the national team after the season he has had. With France, Germany, Belgium or Spain, he would never be picked.\" Joey Barton slams...Jordan Henderson \"Not Steven Gerrard\" Henderson (Photo: PA) \nIf the England managers won't bite aim for the captain. \nKopites are hoping Jordan Henderson can turn himself into the new Steven Gerrard - our Liverpudlian mate is having none of it, whatsoever. \nHenderson hasn't so far got near to the heights of the Anfield legend but there is still time to prove Barton wrong. \nWhat Barton said: \"Someone somewhere trying to make Henderson heir to Gerrard's throne. It will end in tears. He isn't and will never be capable. Not many are. \n\"Heard about Henderson getting told by Rodgers to grab England captain's armband if Rooney goes off. He tried Rooney rightly jogged him on. \n\"Wearing armbands. Trying to impersonate legends is admirable but will end in tears because it's not genuine. Henderson should be himself.\" Joey Barton slams...French footballers Barton gets into a fight in France (Photo: Rex) \nUp until now he has only taken aim at individuals, tame stuff really. \nBut wait, Barton has hit out at an entire nation of footballers - French footballers to be precise. \nBarton left the UK shores behind in 2012, after he was hit by with 12-game ban for losing his head for QPR against Manchester City, and ended up on a season loan at Ligue 1 giants Marseille. \nDuring his time in the south of France he called Thiago Silva an \"overweight lady\" but his most severe attack was handed to his gym shy teammates. \nWhat Barton said: “For them, it [work] is not compatible with talent. If you are talented, no need to work. If you work hard, it is because you don't have talent. \n\"They even convince themselves that they have more talent by working less. Bizarre, right? \n“At Marseille, I thought they had twigged when I saw them go to work in the gym. But no, it was to look good before going to Ibiza in June!” poll loading Which Joey Barton insult hit hardest? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:30:56.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
