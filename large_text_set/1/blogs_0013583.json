Chris Langridge and Marcus Ellis of Great Britain won badminton bronze at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games Seven sports are attempting to challenge UK Sport's decision not to fund their programmes for the Tokyo 2020 Games. \nBadminton is among five sports, funded for Rio 2016, which are challenging the decision made in December. \nThey are joined by goalball and table tennis - not supported in 2016 - which bosses believe are 2020 medal hopefuls. \n\"We've got a really strong case,\" Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy told BBC Sport. \nAll sports have until Tuesday, 17 January to attempt to challenge the decision. \nThe decision to cut all funding for badminton came as a surprise after Chris Langridge and Marcus Ellis won bronze in Rio and helped GB better the target set by UK Sport. \nAlthough proof of correct governance and 'talent pathways' for young athletes form part of the decision-making process, the most important element of any pitch for funding is to prove they have genuine medal prospects for the next Games. \n\"Our understanding is that UK Sport doubt our Olympic medal credentials,\" Christy said. \n\"However, we have players who have not only won Olympic medals but also won world tour titles and super-series titles and these are the biggest events in our sport and we are regularly beating the best in the world.\" \nIn addition to badminton, goalball, table tennis, archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby will all bid for a reprieve. \nPowerlifting received about £890,000 going into the 2016 Paralympic Games where they beat their minimum target of one medal by claiming two. \nAs such they were awarded £1.3m for the Tokyo cycle, but British Powerlifting officials believe they deserve more and will also meet UK Sport in the coming weeks. \nThis is essentially a second opportunity for officials to demonstrate why they deserve funding for the four-year cycle leading into the Tokyo Games. \nUK Sport will reveal their findings by the end of February, with those still unhappy with any verdict then able to make a formal appeal to the 'Sport Resolutions' board. \nThe British wheelchair rugby team have said the decision not to support their athletes represents a \"discriminatory\" attitude, although UK Sport believe the programme does not represent a credible medal prospect for Tokyo. \nBritish wheelchair rugby say they will present \"significant new facts\" to UK Sport and have a \"very strong case\" for a funding reprieve.
