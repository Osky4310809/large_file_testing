Remy didn’t reveal how she came by the photo, but it was clear that her intention was to embarrass Minaj. The tweet followed Remy dropping “ Another One ,” her second diss track for Nicki in just over a week. \nThe photo is evidently from before Nicki became famous, with the rapper looking significantly different. Remy Ma pointed this difference out by captioning the photo #B4TheButtJob. \nBefore long, it seemed as though Remy had thought better of the whole thing, deleting the Instagram post. For a while later, the accompanying tweet that came with it remained on Remy’s Twitter, but she eventually got rid of that too. \nSomehow we don’t think that Remy taking down the photo is going to be enough to quell the bad blood between the two, especially when one bears in mind the lyrics “they was sellin’ footage and you know I bought it,” which seems to suggest that Remy has more physical evidence of Nicki Minaj that might cause her some embarrassment. \nSo far, Nicki hasn’t responded to Remy’s bait — something that could all change now that Remy has made it more personal than ever.
