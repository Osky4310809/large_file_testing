(A girl can dream, can’t she?) \nI’m super into the whole “hot, mysterious musician” thing and would take the opportunity to compete for John Mayer’s love in a millisecond. \nSERENADE ME, JOHN. Giphy \nIt looks like my dream of becoming John Mayer’s new bae isn’t too far-fetched because he talked about being on “The Bachelor” on “The Ellen Degeneres Show” on Friday. \nSurprisingly enough, he loves the show and talked to Ellen about how addicted he becomes when he starts an episode (join the club, John.) \nWhen asked if he was caught up with the current season, he said, \nI love the show, but it’s too much time to ask of me — two hours is a lot of quiet time. \nAfter making his remark, the singer joked he’d pay $50 to get to binge-watch a season in 30 minutes. What’s the fun in that, though?! \nFinally, Ellen asked John the question we’ve all been waiting for. \nShe said, \nYou should be a bachelor! Didn’t we talk about that before? \nYes, Ellen, yes! Persuade him! \nJohn quickly responded to the host, \nI think it would be really fun to be ‘The Bachelor.’ \nHOLY CRAP. HE AGREED. JOHN MAYER WANTS TO BE “THE BACHELOR!” Giphy \nUgh… wait a second. \nAs hopeful as we became in the split second after his response, our dreams of dating John were crushed when Ellen asked him if “he’d really consider it.” \nAlmost instantly, he responded with “no.” \nUGH. WE WERE SO CLOSE. \nWe have to give him some credit, though, because his reasoning was definitely legitimate. \nAfter saying “no” to being on the show, he justified his decision, \nI don’t think that I would find love there, unless they would change the sort of vetting process for who would be the contestants. \nThe singer also said he thinks it’d be “one of the lowest rated shows” if he was featured (we disagree). \nSo… like, I guess there is hope that John Mayer could be the next bachelor. I’m about to call the show’s producers and ask them to consider John’s request ASAP because this needs to happen.
