It can be earned by playing any of the selected 14 minigames and is rewarded at a rate of 1 thaler every 5 minutes. In addition, a different minigame is spotlighted every three days to reward 1 thaler every minute. \nThe time for which thaler are awarded is rounded down at the end of a game. Any remainder is saved and added after a next game. \nPlayers can spend thaler on a wide array of existing minigame rewards in Stanley Limelight 's store . It is also possible to use thaler to buy certain promotional items previously only available from Treasure Hunter . \nCertain Castle Wars rewards like halos and the faithful shield can be obtained with the use of thaler by purchasing the detailed decorative armour set for 3355 thaler and reselling it to Lanthus for 290 gold castle wars tickets . \nWhile untradeable, the value can be compared to the normal Silverhawk feathers assuming you desire to buy the tradeable version for experience given this is equivalent in use. If not, the current value would be based on either the granite body or magic notepaper reward.
