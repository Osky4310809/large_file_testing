According to Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports, the deal is expected to include options beyond the initial six years guaranteed. Per Bob Nightengale of USA Today , it is worth $25 million, the richest-ever contract for a player with less than one year of service in Major League Baseball. The 23-year-old finished seventh in American League Rookie of the Year voting last season. By virtue of the new deal, Anderson is surrendering his arbitration years, as well as his first two years of free agency, according to Nightengale . Anderson appeared in 99 games last season, hitting .283 with nine home runs, 30 RBI and 10 stolen bases. A first-round pick in the 2013 draft, Anderson has quickly emerged as one of MLB's most promising young middle infielders. The White Sox are seemingly in rebuilding mode after trading ace Chris Sale to the Boston Red Sox in December, but signing Anderson to a long-term deal suggests Chicago will heavily rely upon him in the coming years to push itself back into contention. Although the contract is a gamble since Anderson has so little MLB experience under his belt, it could become a massive bargain if the talented shortstop lives up to his potential.
