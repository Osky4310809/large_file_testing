The movie continues to rake in the moolah at both domestic and overseas BO and on day 18, it took its total tally to Rs 180.58 crore at the international box office. Trade analyst Taran Adarsh revealed to us more details about this when he tweeted that Dangal ‘s overseas collection till Sunday was $ 26.47 million (Rs 180.58 cr). \nLooking at the detailed break up, we figure that Dangal has crossed the 11 million mark at the North American box office. The cumulative collections of the movie in that region currently stands at USD 11.13 Million (Rs 75.94 crore). It has also grossed USD 7.51 million (Rs 51.24 crore) at the Gulf box office, while it has collected USD 3.66 million (Rs 24.97 crore) at the UK market. And at the Australian box office, it has collected USD 2.45 million (Rs 16.72 crore).

And even though a few films have released in the international markets, Dangal will still continue to rake in the money. This is courtesy the strong word of mouth publicity that is working in the movie’s favour. In fact, people are still going to theatres to watch the film. And with the film running for one more week, we think Dangal will end with a lifetime overseas collection of Rs 185-Rs 190 crore.
