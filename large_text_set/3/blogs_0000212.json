At MWC this year, the company lifted the curtains off the Moto G5 and G5 Plus ( first impressions ) which feature revamped builds and brand new internals at attractive price points. Seeing how the smartphones will soon be available for purchase in India, we decided to compare the two siblings with each other to check out how they differ… so hopefully, you’d have a much better idea of which one to consider when they reach our shores. Design and Display \nMotorola has taken a completely different approach for the design of the G5 and G5 Plus. Unlike their predecessors, both the G5 and G5 Plus come clad in metal shells and look a lot like the recently-launched Moto Z family. Both the smartphones look identical when put next to each other, with the only differentiating factor being their screen sizes. The G5 Plus comes with a 5.2-inch full HD display where as the G5 sports a smaller 5-inch full HD panel. Arguably the biggest difference in the duo’s design is that the back plate as well as the battery of the Moto G5 is user-replaceable. Unlike last year, both the G5 as well as the G5 Plus sport fingerprint sensors on their chins too. Performance, Storage and Software \nWhile the design of the Moto G5 and the G5 Plus is nearly indistinguishable, the specs of the two devices vary quite a bit. The Moto G5 employs a Snapdragon 430 SoC to power its internals whereas the G5 Plus utilises a much faster Snapdragon 625 chip. For RAM, the former comes with up to 3GB of memory whereas the latter comes with up to 4GB. The Moto G5 Plus is, without a shadow of doubt, the better smartphone in terms of specs. \nFor storage, the Moto G5 comes in two different variants of 16GB and 32GB. Similarly, the Moto G5 Plus also comes in two different variants of 32GB and 64GB storage. Both the smartphones support microSD cards up to 256GB for expansion of storage. \nOn the software side of things, both the devices will run a near-stock version of Android Nougat upon first boot. The devices make use of Google’s Pixel launcher and also come bundled with Google’s handy Assistant. Camera, Battery and Connectivity \nThe Moto G5 comes with a 13MP sensor on the back whereas the G5 Plus users a 12MP sensor to click stills. Don’t let the pixel count fool you though, as the G5 Plus utilises dual-pixel technology which should result in much better pictures. Also, the camera of the G5 Plus can record videos in 4K resolution whereas the G5 is limited to just full HD. Both the smartphones get 5MP sensors for selfies. The Moto G5 sources its fuel from a 2,800mAh battery. On the other hand, the G5 Plus uses a slightly bigger 3,000mAh cell. The difference in the capacities shouldn’t make much of a difference in the battery life and as we mentioned earlier, users can pop in a spare battery the second their G5 runs out of juice, something which isn’t possible with the G5 Plus’s sealed unit. Both the smartphones come with standard connectivity options along with support for 4G LTE. \nBuyers who require a smartphone for basic multitasking which is limited to browsing the web or accessing social media should go for the Moto G5. On the other hand, users which will be using their smartphones more intensively, and / or covet a phone with good camera image quality should stick with the G5 Plus.
