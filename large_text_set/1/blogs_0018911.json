Arsene Wenger looks set to carry on at Arsenal (Photo: Arsenal via Getty) \nNot much between them and in the four and a quarter years of their tenures, Dyche has spent, net, considerably less than Howe, roughly £20million less. Unlike Howe in that time, he has suffered a relegation, but Dyche’s net spend has been around the £25m mark which makes the job he has done at Burnley even more remarkable. \nBringing them straight back to the Premier League was an outstanding achievement. \nA Big Six club, though, will be beyond Dyche. It probably doesn’t help he appears to have a king-sized chip on his shoulder. \nEarlier in the season, his comments on how foreign coaches get undue praise was eerily reminiscent of the Sam Allardici moment. \nThis was part of Dyche’s diatribe. \n“Conte came in at Chelsea and got commended for bringing a hard, fast, new leadership which involved doing 800m runs, 400m runs, 200m runs. \n“Come to my training and see Sean Dyche doing that and you’d say ‘dinosaur, a young English dinosaur manager, hasn’t got a clue.’” \nFirstly, referring to yourself in the third person is never a great look and, secondly, Conte mainly gets commended for his brilliant record. \nBut Dyche had a point. Antonio Conte has uses similar methods to Dyche (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nForeign coaches tend to get lauded for the diets they introduce – banning tomato ketchup, that sort of thing – as if British coaches run their staff canteen like a greasy spoon. \nMaybe one of the reasons Brits might be unfairly overlooked is that, quite simply, a very cosmopolitan league is suited to cosmopolitan managers. \nThere remains a deep-rooted insularity about British managers and it is easy to see how that counts against them. \nAnd Dyche has built a very British team. Of the 14 players used against Southampton in Burnley’s last league game, only one was from outside these Isles. \nYet what Dyche has done is improve players – take Michael Keane as a shining example – and get his group punching above its weight. \nSurely, those are fundamental qualities that should make him eminently employable by a club, for example, the size of Arsenal. \nHe will not be employed by one the size of Arsenal. \nHe would not even be on the shortlist if Wenger walked. \nChip on his shoulder or not, being British means there is only so far he can go.
