Rangers had fallen behind rivals Celtic (Photo: PA) \nSubsequently, Warburton was heavily backed to become the new boss of Nottingham Forest before the Championship club decided to stick with interim boss Gary Brazil until the end of the season. \nApproximately 24 hours after brokering his deal with the Rangers board, Lockwood then attempted to move the goalposts and said the management staff would be happy to work on at Ibrox, but would still expect to leave for no compensation when the time was right. \nFurious, Rangers directors called a board meeting - and on Friday night they moved, accepting what they claim was the trio’s original resignation and putting them on notice. \nThey will not take control of the team again and under-20 coach Graham Murty has been put in charge for Sunday’s Scottish Cup tie against Morton at Ibrox. \nOne insider said: “It has been clear for some time the manager has been looking elsewhere and the suspicion was confirmed when his agent initiated contact with the board this week. Warburton won the Championship with Rangers last season (Photo: Steve Welsh) \n“The agent took a gamble on behalf of his client and it didn't work. \n\"Rangers are bigger than any one person and the most important thing is finding the stability to take the club to second in the Premiership this season and securing Europa League football next season.” \nWarburton and McParland have been under increasing pressure for the failure of their signings to hit the ground running, particularly since the start of the season. \nThey have signed 13 players and forked out almost £3.5 million in transfer fees, but few of McParland’s recommendations have been a success. \nRangers are languishing 27 points behind Celtic in the title race when Warburton was charged with keeping his side competitive with the reigning champions, at least until the latter stages of their return to the top flight. \nOf more concern to the board has been the failure of Warburton’s squad to broker daylight between themselves in second and Aberdeen and Hearts, despite having up to four times the budget of Derek McInnes and Ian Cathro.
