At first glance, the notes look genuine, but if you look closely, they are full of errors. The notes mention ‘Children Bank of India’ in place of Reserve Bank of India and ‘Guaranteed by the Children’s Government’ in place of Guaranteed by the Central Government. The fake notes had ‘churan label’ in place of the latent image and a ‘PK’ logo at the lower half where bank’s seal is seen in the original currency note. \nAccording to a Hindustan Times report, a call center employee on February 6 withdrew Rs 8000 from the SBI ATM at Sangam Vihar. He later realized that all the four notes that the ATM dispensed were fake. He immediately approached the police station nearby to report the matter.
