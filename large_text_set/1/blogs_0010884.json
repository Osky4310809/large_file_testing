Good for both sides,\" he said. President-elect: Donald Trump praised Brexit in an interview with The Times (AP Photo) \nHe made clear that - unlike his predecessor who urged British voters to back Remain - he welcomed last June's referendum vote. \n\"People, countries want their own identity and the UK wanted its own identity,\" he said. \"Brexit is going to end up being a great thing.\" \nDespite having prompted fears of a new arms race last year when he said the US needed to \"greatly strengthen and expand\" its nuclear capability, Mr Trump indicated he would like to strike a new nuclear deal with Russia. \n\"For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, that's part of it,\" he said.
