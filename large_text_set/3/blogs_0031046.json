Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters Israel UN criticism of Israel bombing Hezbollah is absurd, says Johnson \nForeign secretary speaks out after UK mission puts UN ‘on notice’ over Human Rights Council ‘bias against Israel’ View more sharing options Tuesday 28 March 2017 15.48 BST Last modified on Tuesday 28 March 2017 15.49 BST \nBoris Johnson, the UK foreign secretary, has condemned the UN Human Rights Council criticism of Israeli bombing of Hezbollah positions in the Golan Heights as “absolutely preposterous” and “a profound absurdity”. \nHe was speaking after the UK mission to the UN in Geneva put the UN “on notice” that it would vote against all resolutions about Israel’s conduct in the occupied Syrian and Palestinian territories unless the Human Rights Council ended what the UK mission described as anti-Israel bias. \nThe overall tone of the UK government approach to Israel , if not its policy, has shifted since Donald Trump’s election, leaving behind the previous enthusiastic support for the US Democrat’s harsh criticisms of Israel’s conduct in the occupied territories. \nThe US secretary of state Rex Tillerson has already threatened to withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council, and the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, delighted the Israel lobby this week when she promised ”the era of Israel bashing” at the UN was coming to an end. \nThe UK mission put the UN on notice about its own approach to Israel on the final day of the council’s 34th session last week. \nThe move was described as petulant by the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard and was also attacked by Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman. Israel rejects 'shameful' UN resolution amid criticism of Netanyahu Read more \nIn its statement the UK mission made clear its “serious concerns about the growth in illegal demolitions and settlement activity” and said the UK stood “shoulder to shoulder with the international community” in support of a two-state solution , but added the council’s “unacceptable pattern of bias” would only make the goal harder to achieve. \nThe UK protested: “Israel is a population of eight million in a world of seven billion. Yet since its foundation, the Human Rights Council has adopted 135 country-specific resolutions; 68 of which against Israel. Justice is blind and impartial. This selective focus on Israel is neither. Israel is the only country permanently on the Human Rights Council’s agenda”. \nJohnson told MPs at foreign office questions on Tuesday that it was “absolutely preposterous” that there should be a motion condemning Israel’s policy in the Golan Heights “when after all in that region of Syria we have seen the most appalling barbarity by the Assad regime and that was the point the UK government was rightly making.” He added the UN approach was “a profound absurdity”. \nJohnson insisted the UK remained committed to a two-state solution, but said he opposed boycotts of goods produced in the occupied territories, saying the choice should be left to consumers. \nMore broadly in Commons questions, Johnson repeatedly praised America, saying “it was a mature democratic system in which we can confide our trust”, adding that Trump’s claim that GCHQ were involved in bugging the President-elect would have done no more damage to the UK-US intelligence relationship “as a gnat on a rhinoceros or an elephant”. It will not make any difference to the fundamental relationship, he insisted, although he accepted the allegation itself was absurd and ridiculous. \nJohnson was upbraided for dismissing the controversy by Keith Simpson, the Conservative MP and a former parliamentary secretary to the previous foreign secretary William Hague. Simpson said “The core element of the Anglo-America relationship is based on five eyes and intelligence. President Trump’s allegations repeated from Fox News was not a gnat on an elephant. It was deeply damaging”. \nJohnson – who was in the US last week to meet senior administration officials – claimed more widely he had received some encouragement that the Trump administration was changing its stance on climate change. He added that US policy on a range of issues, from the Iran nuclear agreement to the future of Nato and relations with Russia, was now more closely aligned with UK thinking.
