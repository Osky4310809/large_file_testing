All kidding aside though—or are we?—Corinne was at her most vulnerable as she broke down in Nick's arms following her elimination. As the limo drove away, she vowed never to go to such lengths to \"win\" a man ever again. So, three months later, how is she doing now? And why is she still stunned that Nick sent her home? Over the weekend at the Women Tell All taping, we caught up with the one-of-a-kind contestant to find out all that and more. \nGlamour: Tonight's episode was filmed in November. Are you over Nick? \nCorinne Olympios : It’s in the past. The feelings are done. But it was shocking to be sent home because we just had such an amazing hometown date, and to me it looked like it was the best one. I just thought we had something really good going; it’s just a shame. But you can’t make anybody love you or want to be with you—I’d rather know the truth than be led on and find out something terrible later on. \nGlamour: After your elimination, you said “I’m so sorry\" to Nick. Do you have any regrets? \nCorinne : No, no, no, I have no regrets. I really don’t. I’m really happy with the way the season went for me. \nGlamour: In the limo, you said, “I’m done trying to impress men. I’m never going to kiss up to a man anymore.” Do you still feel the same? \nCorinne : Yeah. I think the next man that I get myself involved with that it’s very important for me to feel important. Because in my past relationships, I haven’t felt so important. I just feel like us women need to realize that we do deserve to be put up on a pedestal. Facebook PHOTO: Jeff Daly/ABC \nGlamour: What do you wish viewers knew about you that you don’t think came across this season? \nCorinne : Actually, I’m a lot smarter than I look. Sometimes my personality is laid back, you know? And then, if you really piss me off, I’ll come out. Sometimes people can take that as, \"She has no idea what’s going on. She’s this and she’s that.\" No, I’m just playing the game better than you can. So, you know, I think people underestimate me a lot and you shouldn’t. \nGlamour: When I first met you the day before filming I knew you were a charismatic personality, but never would I have seen the “villain” label coming. \nCorinne : I mean, I don’t even pay attention to the label. I really don’t. I was just me, and I was just doing things in my time with Nick that the girls were maybe jealous of because I was doing kind of big things in my time with Nick. I don’t really think that that’s a villain. I never personally attacked anyone. I never did anything vicious. I don’t think that that’s a villain. \nGlamour: The platinum vagine comment…where did that even come from?! \nCorinne : I don’t even know! Sometimes I say things and I’m like, \"Where did I get that from? Where did that come from?\" \nGlamour: Some of your soundbites were almost too good. I was like, \"OK, someone has to be telling her what to say.\" \nCorinne : No! It’s all me! I don’t even know how I do it. [ Laughs ] I think it’s because I’m stuck in an office all day, so when I get out I just burst out with my stupid Corinne-isms sometimes. I feel like they’re all building up that it just comes naturally. \nGlamour: Did you purposely play yourself up on The Bachelor or would you say this is you, 100%? \nCorinne : It was me 100%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:27:39.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
