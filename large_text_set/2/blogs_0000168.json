We must see the proposals and if I'm going to play.” \nAubameyang has bagged 100 goals in 166 games for the Bundesliga outfit since his £11million arrival from Saint-Etienne in 2013, with 20 in 23 games this term. Aubameyang has made his hopes clear (Photo: Rex Features) \nYet there had been a growing resignation among the club’s hierarchy that this would be Aubameyang’s final season at BVB, particularly with his repeated statements about his dream to join Real Madrid. \nAnd Aubameyang’s latest comments have not gone down well with the club’s hierarchy, leading sporting director Michael Zorc to urge the hitman to stop giving interviews and return his focus to Dortmund’s Champions League fight.
