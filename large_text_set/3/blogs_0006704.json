Now DiCaprio is supporting a more sustainable alternative by investing in LoveTheWild , a seafood farm. The Oscar winner will also join the Colorado-based company’s advisory board. \nAmericans don’t show seafood much love. According to Quartz, the average person in the world consumes 44 pounds of seafood per year, but Americans only eat around a third of that number. Meanwhile, Americans eat around 71 pounds of red meat every year, according to one U.S. Department of Agriculture figure, even though around 10 to 12 percent of all United States emissions stem from beef, according to Bard College professor Gidon Eshel, speaking in DiCaprio’s documentary. \nRelated: Leonardo DiCaprio appointed brand ambassador for Chinese electric vehicle maker \nSo DiCaprio is offering a more sustainable meat option: fish . And not just any fish, but farm-raised, sustainable fish. In a statement DiCaprio said, “Seafood is a primary source of protein for nearly a billion people – but climate change , acidification, and overfishing are putting increased pressure on our oceans ‘ natural stability. LoveTheWild’s approach to sustainable, responsible aquaculture is promoting the development of a secure and environmentally-conscious solution to feeding our planet’s growing population.” \nAccording to a LoveTheWild infographic , farmed fish “is the most resource efficient animal protein on the planet.” Aquaculture rarely draws on hormones or drugs, as the meat industry often does, and farmed fish can lack mercury and other contaminants often found in seafood. LoveTheWild drew on information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to say aquaculture, when done correctly, can even support the health of the environment. \nLoveTheWild co-founder and CEO Jacqueline Claudia said in a statement, “We are excited that Mr. DiCaprio, someone so dedicated to environmental activism, has partnered with LoveTheWild to help make it easy for consumers [to] make an impact on the environment through something as simple as choosing the right thing for dinner.” \nImages via screenshot and LoveTheWild Facebook View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T18:27:14.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
