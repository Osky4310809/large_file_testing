King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 10 hours ago 4 \nRHCP guitarist Josh Klinghoffer recently discussed seeing and meeting John Frusciante for the first time way back in 1997, branding it the \"first night of the rest of my life.\" \nHe said in a response to fan mail : \"I will tell this short story since the 20 year anniversary of it just passed. \n\"I went with one of my closest friends Brian and his sister to see Thelonoius Monster play at the Delancey Street Foundation in Hollywood. I'm pretty sure it was January 3rd, 1997. \n\"The band was Bob, Pete, Dix Denny, Flea and John F. \n\"John had a Sex Pistols shirt on that he'd crossed the band name off of and substituted it with 'John F.' It was the first time I'd met any of those guys. John didn't have a guitar strap so he sat on the floor. It was an atypical place for a rock concert. \n\"It was magical to little 17 year old me. It kinda was the first night of the rest of my life.\" \nThe two musicians went on to become close friends and frequent musical collaborators. \nDuring a recent interview with Gitarre & Bass Magazine, Josh explained why he can't be friends with John right now , saying: \n\"[I don't really stay in contact with John]. We're both very busy. Honestly, it would be very weird playing with the Peppers and hanging out with John. I think it wouldn't come naturally to him either. It's better to keep a distance, in my opinion.\" \nHe added: \"Yes, [we were best friends] for sure. And I'm not planning on not talking to him till the day I die. \n\"We decided to take different paths. It would be weird if we would talk privately. Especially for me who had some problems with this new album. I can't call him to complain about this and that and let him in on how miserable I feel about certain things. \n\"Why should I show my weakness? Why should he listen to that? And how hurtful would it be for him? I think we need to put some daylight between us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T03:14:26.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
