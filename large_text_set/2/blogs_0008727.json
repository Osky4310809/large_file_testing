Picture: Annette Dew \nBoyd, 29, last year evolved into the best fullback in the game, earning the No. 1 jersey for Queensland and Australia. \nLast week declared he was ready to assume the captaincy duties. \n“I’m ready for the captaincy,” Boyd said. \n“Being captain is something that is still foreign to me and something I will be learning if I do get the job. \n“I would be learning on the run a bit, but we have a great leadership group to help out. \n“Adam Blair, Sammy Thaiday, Andrew McCullough, Ben Hunt and Gillo (Matt Gillett), there are heaps of guys who lead by example and do some great things so whoever gets the role will have good support. \n“Wayne hasn’t told me if I’ve got the job. He likes to keep those things close to his chest and reveal it as late as possible. \n“I’m happy just to have my name thrown up among some past and great players. There hasn’t been a lot of Broncos captains so to even have my name mentioned is something I wouldn’t have thought of a few years ago.’’ \nBoyd will join an illustrious list of league greats to have captained the club including Darren Lockyer, Allan Langer and Wally Lewis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:33:28.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
