Everything, from handling your finances, to doing things alone, nothing prepares you better for adulthood than shifting base. \nThe first thing that you are going to love and cherish is the independence. Sure, you have a family that lets you do what you want without asking too many questions, but this kind of independence goes far beyond your mom asking you what time you will be coming home. When you are out there on your own, you have the true freedom of being your own self. You get to decide your own rules, you set up your own ways of fighting through the struggles, you are the only one responsible for what happens to you. The joy of doing things on your own, and succeeding at it is simply beautiful. \nAlso, moving out of your home is the best way to put in practise all those life rules that you have charted out in your head. Because you are paying your own rent, fending for your food, and taking care of yourself during sickness, you automatically set a plan that really does work. \nAnother thing that moving out teaches you is dealing with people. This is it, the \"real world\", and you will meet all sorts of people who you cannot really ignore anymore. Your roommate might be a bit cuckoo, your landlord might be the most difficult person you've known, your boss, your college mates might not be the friendliest... but you will have to find a way to deal with them, and learn to live with the way they are. \nBeing vulnerable, learning to trust your gut, and learning your lessons is the best way to get a slice of what adulthood is really like. \nDo it, pack those bags, pick a city, and go live your dreams!
