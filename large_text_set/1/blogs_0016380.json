I had the chance to connect with Matthieu Gobbi, General Manager for Aerophile (the group responsible for operating the balloon), who shed some light on the update, sharing “the new balloon envelope was inspired by the springs and the element of water – it’s very coherent, as the balloon floats in the air, then lands on the water of Lake Buena Vista.” Indeed, the color palette, with soothing blues and a scrolling pattern that makes me think of gentle ripples in the water, fits seamlessly with the overall aesthetic of Disney Springs. \n\nThough the balloon exterior may have gotten a makeover, the experience of taking a flight up to 400 feet in the air remains unchanged. (Having taken a few flights myself, I know how exhilarating it is – and how incredible the views are … if you haven’t done it yet, I’d highly recommend it!) \nReady to fly? Adult pricing is $20 per person and children (ages 3-8) are $15 each. Tip: visit before 10:00 a.m. and tickets are only $10 per person, regardless of age. The location opens daily at 8:30 a.m., weather permitting, and wait times are typically shorter earlier in the day. \nIf you’ve had the chance to experience a flight, please tell me in the comments below – I’d love to know what you enjoyed most!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:08:09.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
