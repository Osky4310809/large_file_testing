Jan suffered a catastrophic brain injury including multiple skull fractures. My little Angel was unfortunately not wearing a helmet which arguably would have prevented the extreme nature of her injuries. \nI will fully admit that there has been no experience in my life that could have prepared me for this life changing week. To see one‚Äôs life partner and love of one‚Äôs life being kept alive via life support equipment is tragically heartbreaking. We'll never be able to thank everyone for all your prayers for my wife Jan who's still in critical condition in OU Medical Center. üôèüôè \n‚Äî Jim Ross (@JRsBBQ) March 22, 2017 \nMick Foley and The Big Show were among those sending prayers to the Ross family. I'm praying for that miracle @JRsBBQ . I am so very sorry. https://t.co/fy4tbi6RNI \n‚Äî Mick Foley (@RealMickFoley) March 22, 2017 \nThoughts and prayers to Jim and Jan Ross from everyone at FOX Sports. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:43:20.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
