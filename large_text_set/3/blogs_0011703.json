Cummins should replace Starc 0:48 \nWhile Marsh had already flown home from the India tour, such a lengthy rehabilitation process would not only rule him out of the Champions Trophy in June but also put his availability for next summer’s Ashes series in serious doubt. \nThe Ashes begins at the Gabba on November 23, while Marsh could be available until mid-to-late December. \nMarsh struggled with the shoulder injury throughout the summer, but his pace had dipped noticeably in recent weeks and he was only called on to bowl five overs across the opening two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar series. \n“We have been managing (it) up until now but unfortunately it has progressively deteriorated to a point where he is unable to function at the level required,” Australian team physiotherapist David Beakley said after Marsh was ruled out of the series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T03:34:07.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
