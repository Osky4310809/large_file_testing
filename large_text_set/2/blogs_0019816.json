There weren't many exciting releases, and the most fascinating tech was restricted to the top end of the market. \nThe best tablet in the world is still the iPad Pro 9.7 , but that's not cheap so we've put a selection of the most affordable tablets together. That includes both the iPad mini 2 and Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, which joined our best budget tablet list during the second half of 2016.\nThere are a number of high quality affordable slates available, and the following are our favourite choices for the best cheap tablet you can buy right now.\nBest tablet 2016 | Best iPad | Best Android tablets | Best business tablets | Best cheap tablet deals \n5. Amazon Fire It's the cheapest from Amazon so far \nWeight: 313g | Dimensions: 115 x 191 x 10.6mm | OS: Fire OS 5 | Screen size: 7-inch | Resolution: 1024 x 600 | CPU: Quad-core 1.3GHz | RAM: N/A | Storage: 8GB | Battery: N/A | Rear camera: 2MP | Front camera: VGA\nFamily friendly Sturdy design Poor selection of apps Questionable OS design Amazon has gone for the lowest price possible on the new Fire tablet, and that means it's not for everybody. You can pick it up for £50 - that's a true cheap tablet - and Amazon thinks you'll want six around your home as well as giving one to your kids.\nConsidering the price, it has some good spec and has a sturdy design that isn't going to break right away. If money is your biggest factor, the Amazon Fire may be the one for you.\nRead the full review: Amazon Fire \n\n4. Asus ZenPad S 8.0 A high-res screen and speedy performance\nWeight: 350g | Dimensions: 203 x 134 x 6.6mm | OS: Android 5.0 Lollipop | Screen size: 8 inches | Resolution: 2048 x 1536 | CPU: Intel Atom Z3580 quad-core | RAM: 2/4GB | Storage: 16/32/64GB | microSD slot: Yes | Battery: 8 hours | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 5MP\nLow price Superb high-res screen A lot of pre-installed apps Average camera The Asus ZenPad S 8.0 - also known as the Asus ZenPad Z580C - is a great value tablet with a premium looking design. \nIt's one of the best looking slates on this list and packs a surprising 10 hour battery life, microSD support as well as a great 8-inch screen. The best part though is the price, it's only £129.99.\nDon't want to spend much on your new tablet? This choice from Asus is one of the best options for you.\nRead the full review: Asus ZenPad S 8.0 \n\n3. Amazon Fire HD 10 and HD 8 Amazon's latest slates are excellent child fodder \nWeight: 432g/311g | Dimensions: 159 x 262 x 7.7mm/128 x 214 x 7.7mm | OS: Fire OS 5 | Screen size: 10.1-inch/8-inch | Resolution: 1,280 x 800 | CPU: Quad-core 1.5GHz | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 16GB/8GB | Battery: up to 8 hours | Rear camera: 5MP | Front camera: VGA\nLow price Impressive speakers Sluggish performance Poor screen resolution If you're in the market for a low cost tablet with up to date specs then the new Amazon Fire HD 8 and HD 10 deliver.\nThey won't bless you with a stunning display, sultry design or slick performance - but they will give you enough grunt under the hood to play even the most demanding of games.\nThe heavily modified Android interface (known as Fire OS) may not be to everyone's liking, but for less tech savvy users it's arguably less cluttered and easier to use.\nRead the full review: Amazon Fire HD 10 and HD 8 \n\n2. Amazon Fire HD 6 If you live on Amazon you'll want a Fire \nWeight: 290g | Dimensions: 169 x 103 x 10.7mm | OS: Fire OS 5 | Screen size: 6-inch | Resolution: 800 x 1280 | CPU: Quad-core 1.5GHz | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 8GB/16GB | Rear camera: 2MP | Front camera: VGA\nCompact size Prime integration Awful cameras Fire OS can be restrictive The Amazon Fire HD 6 is one of the most enticing tablets to come from Amazon, mixing efficient integration with the Prime services and a compact footprint that makes it easy to drop in your bag.\nIt's no tablet king, but it does what it sets out to well. Its crazy low price tag means it's perfect to hand off to the kids without the fear that they're wielding an expensive bit of kit around.\nIt may be too small for some, and the cameras aren't up to much, but the Fire HD 6 gives you the core tablet experience for not very much outlay, making it a budget tablet worth buying.\nRead the full review: Amazon Fire HD 6 \n\n1. iPad mini 2 The best value iPad out there \nWeight: 331g | Dimensions: 200 x 134.7 x 7.5mm | OS: iOS 9 | Screen size: 7.9-inch | Resolution: 1536 x 2048 | CPU: Dual-core 1.3GHz | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 16/32/64/128GB | Battery: 6470mAh | Rear camera: 5MP | Front camera: 1.2MP\nAmazing screen Brilliant design Similar-spec rivals are much cheaper 16GB too low storage What's this? The iPad mini 2 in a list of the best cheap tablets? Why yes. It may be a premium slate but it's been superseded by the iPad mini 4 and the already discontinued iPad mini 3 and as such it's dropped in price to under £250.\nBetter yet, as the iPad mini 3 is basically the same tablet with added Touch ID you hardly miss out on anything by buying this older model, though you do miss out on the power-boost found in the iPad mini 4.\nStill, with a brilliant screen, a stunning design and quite a lot of power the iPad mini 2 is difficult to beat at this price point. It looks, feels and performs like something far more expensive making it our favorite budget tablet you can buy in 2017.\nRead the full review: Apple iPad mini 2 \nGot a bit extra to spend?
