There’s still plenty of work to be done before that day, but he’s distracted by other matters of the utmost importance (to him). That is, he’s complaining on Twitter about a photo that CNN chose for a book, Unprecedented (as opposed to his version , “unpresidented”), which details his stunning path to election victory. Trump hopes that the book does well, but he’s upset that the cable news network chose the “worst cover photo of me!”\n@CNN just released a book called \"Unprecedented\" which explores the 2016 race & victory. Hope it does well but used worst cover photo of me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 \n\nExactly which photo Trump is referring to isn’t entirely clear. Here’s what CNN is advertising on Twitter.\nGet the 2017 inaugural edition of CNN's book \"Unprecedented\" in stores or online https://t.co/mc3RFkFF3O #unprecedented pic.twitter.com/hw3vZ1ge8V \n— CNN (@CNN) January 2, 2017 \n\nAnd here’s how the book appears on Amazon’s website , although this could be the December version of the book, since the Amazon description mentions a second printing, the “Inaugural Edition.” That would probably be the first photo that appears above.\n\nVia CNN \nRegardless of which photo Trump is beefing over, we’ll soon have a president who complains about photos of himself. Sort of like when Axl Rose and Beyonce tried to erase not-so-kind photos of themselves on the Internet, Trump can’t stop himself from grumbling.\nThere’s also the awkward reality that both of the above photos aren’t all that unflattering compared to, you know, other photos. This would include one particular Getty photo — which is legitimately bad — that Trump absolutely hates. And of course, Twitter began to remind Trump of this image.\n@EthanDLawrence @realDonaldTrump this one is his favorite pic pic.twitter.com/GMJcxmEUev \n— Chad Kimrey (@TheChoons) January 2, 2017 \n@realDonaldTrump @CNN did they use this one? pic.twitter.com/1ezRJuxPqv \n— Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) January 2, 2017 \n\nHe kinda brought this on himself. Also, one brave fellow reminded Trump that he shouldn’t be too upset about the CNN cover because, well, it looks just like him.\n. @realDonaldTrump Hate to break this to you, but… that's what you look like.\n— James Martin (@Pundamentalism) January 2, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:50:31.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
