Megsquats —doesn’t care about your Fruit Ninja high score. Not when she can smash a friggin’ watermelon between her thighs. Seriously, we can no longer be impressed by karate instructors breaking “cinder blocks” over their heads, because this thigh-powered watermelon-demolition is the new benchmark of destroying stuff with your body. \nNow, we should clarify that Gallagher doesn’t fully crush the watermelon, but her trained legs put enough pressure on the bulbous fruit to send juice oozing out of the cuts (which she sliced in the fruit, which is basically akin to putting chalk on your hands before a deadlift). Besides, can you send juice oozing out of a watermelon using only your thighs? Didn’t think so.
