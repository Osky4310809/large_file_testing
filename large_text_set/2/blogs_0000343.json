(Photo: The CW /Warner Bros. TV) \n“I got the audition and looked over the materials and instantly felt drawn to Gypsy — who I don’t think I knew was going to be called Gypsy, ” Camacho told ComicBook.com. “ I didn’t know certainly as much about her as I do now. I think there’s a certain level of secrecy that they need to have but I was really drawn to her and I was really excited to audition. Auditions can be nerve-wracking, but I was so interested in playing her that I told myself, even if the only time I get to play her is in the audition room, I want to have fun with it. I was just really genuinely excited and I went in there and just had fun and it just felt right from the get-go.” \nOf course, it was more than just the actual name of the character she would be playing that was a bit of a surprise to Camacho; as somebody who had only a passing knowledge of comics, she took it upon herself to study up on the character. \n“I didn’t know that Gypsy had history, ” she continued.“ I didn’t know about any of this stuff. The fans kind of guided me to her history and stuff. The DC world is so expansive and has so many amazing characters, and this was my first foray into the comics world. I started looking into Gypsy, Cindy Reynolds, Justice League Detroit, and looking into that world and their backstories, and it was just so cool to me. I feel like there are endless possibilities for their storylines and endless possibilities for where they might go after having learned about the crazy, insane, vast world of DC Comics.” \nSo what's next for her? We'll have to find out tonight...!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:32:06.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
