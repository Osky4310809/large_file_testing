Steve King is not under fire. He is a racist. The Devil lives in flames. pic.twitter.com/j8HXXOXxKi \n— Terrell J. Starr (@Russian_Starr) March 12, 2017 GOP Congressman @SteveKingIA promotes the un-American ideas of white nationalism. Will any Republican congressmen condemn his bigotry? https://t.co/5etQ8fwZx2 \n— Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) March 12, 2017 \nThe liberal outlet Slate declared King’s tweet is “an apparent, explicit call to protect white ‘culture and demographics’ from immigrants. It’s the type of rhetoric that you might find at a Klan rally.” \nAt least one fellow Republican lawmaker has criticized King’s comment. Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who is Cuban-American, wondered if he counted as “someone else’s baby” in a reply to the Iowa congressman’s tweet. . @SteveKingIA What exactly do you mean? Do I qualify as \"somebody else's baby?\" #concernedGOPcolleague \n— Carlos Curbelo (@carloslcurbelo) March 13, 2017 \nKing is a well-known immigration hawk who has been criticized in the past for his remarks on the subject.
