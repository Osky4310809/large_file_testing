Both victims became weak and suffered abnormal heart rhythms that required resuscitation. Aconite, a plant-based toxin, was later found in lab tests of the patients and provided tea samples, city health officials said. \nThe unidentified male victim has since recovered and is no longer hospitalized, spokeswoman Rachael Kagan told the Chronicle. \nThe city’s medical examiner will now determine an official cause and manner of death as health department officials work with the store’s owner to trace the source of the contaminated products. \n“Anyone who has purchased tea from this location should not consume it and should throw it away immediately,” Dr. Tomas Aragon, the health officer for the city and county of San Francisco, said in a statement . “Aconite poisoning attacks the heart and can be fatal.” \nConsumption of aconite – also known as monkshood, helmet flower, wolfsbane, chuanwu, caowu or fuzi – has long been used in Asian herbal medicine to treat pain, bruises and other conditions. The plant’s raw roots are generally toxic without being properly processed, producing symptoms nearly immediately, including numbness of the face, mouth or limbs, paralysis, vomiting, dangerously low blood pressure and irregular heart rhythms that can lead to sudden death. \nThere is no known antidote for aconite position, city health officials said. \nNews of the woman’s death shocked residents of San Francisco’s Chinatown, one of the city’s top tourist attractions. \n“I myself even get sick eating at some of the places here,” Chinatown merchant Robert Kinann told ABC7 News . “Getting sick is one thing, dying is another.” \nA reporter for ABC7 News was asked to leave the store after asking to speak with the owner, the station reported. \n“They were going in there to seek a remedy and they thought they would get help, but they didn’t,” tourist Kelly Tam told the station. “And that’s really sad.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:41:45.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
