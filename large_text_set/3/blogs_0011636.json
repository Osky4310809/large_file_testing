However this is not a possibility because of the IUD, so Children by Choice needs to raise money as soon as possible for a $450 surgical termination.\n“She is single parenting with two children… and feels she can handle a $15 per fortnight repayment plan [up to $150]… so we need to try and find $300 somewhere.”\nBradley groans.\nThe organisation, which started as a handful of volunteers in 1972, has been fighting for abortion to be taken out of Queensland’s criminal code for decades.

These are women who are fleeing domestic violence, these are women who are suicidal.”\nView this image › \nGina Rushton/BuzzFeed News \nID: 10710218 Legislation to decriminalise abortion in Queensland is currently on the backburner after every member of the state’s Liberal National opposition vowed to vote against the bill last month.\nDecriminalisation wouldn’t be a “magic wand” but access can not improve until there are at least some terminations provided in public institutions, Tooker says. It is currently a “two-tiered system” in which “poor women suffer the most”.\n“If you are wealthy or at least have some resources, you can afford an abortion or afford to travel to get one. If you’re poor, you can’t.\n“If you live in a metropolitan area you’ve got a better chance of access; if you’re further out, it is harder.\n“And if you are having an abortion for a fetal abnormality, some hospitals will allow the termination; [but] if you’re having an abortion for any other reason then you need a private clinic.”\nThe staff at Children by Choice were frustrated and disheartened by the public discourse after bills to decriminalise abortion were proposed by independent Cairns MP Rob Pyne.

But there is also a gestational limit, so unless there is a serious fetal abnormality, or risk to the mother’s life, you can’t really get a termination at that stage.”\nInstead, Tooker’s client was going to go down the adoption route.\n“I’ve been linking her in with adoption services and just helping her process the fact that she is pregnant and going to be having a child. She is under 25 and at risk of homelessness so we are looking at her accommodation situation.”\nThe idea that abortion is “accessible” is common among people who haven’t had an abortion, or are privileged enough that it isn’t a difficult process, she says.\n“If you found it easy to access an abortion you are lucky, white, well-off and probably live in a city.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T03:02:19.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
