Nope. Nope. \nA body artist in Russia, who goes by just the name Aleksandr , is under fire for a video that surfaced online of him drugging and tattooing his hairless pet Sphynx cat. Poor thing! \nAccording to The Sun , Aleksandr admitted to giving the kitty (named Demon ) an anesthetic so that he could \"stand the pain\" of the ink needle — and that he knows he might've been in the wrong. \nThough he obviously didn't feel remorse while filming the entire process! \nHe later said: \n\"Of course I feel pity for doing it to him. It's not like he wanted to do it himself. He has a different skin, so tattoos are applied differently. I hope it is not too bad for him, it is not his first tattoo. Usually he feels fine and recovers from the anesthesia pretty fast.\" \nHe \"hopes\"?? Maybe if it can't consent, DON'T TATTOO IT! \nJust a new rule we thought up just now. Clearly Aleksandr's wife didn't stop him either because she's totally in the video helping out. \nAnimal activist Yelizaveta Skorynina argued that Sphynx cats like Demon have extremely sensitive skin, so it's likely VERY painful. \nAnd it is a high risk to drug them (obviously): \n\"The drug turns off the movement of the cat, but the brain is still working. If he does it frequently, it could affect its heart.\" \nThe tattoos, of a prison tower, a pretty woman, and a cigarette, are obviously intended to make Demon look badass; they're common Russian mob ink. \nThis is just absurd. Drugging and torturing your cat just to turn it into a cool accessory? Disgusting! \nWatch the shocking and sad video (below)!! \nUGH!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:53:49.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
