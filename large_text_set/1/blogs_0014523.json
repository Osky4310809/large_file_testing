Celebrities slam Donald Trump Thu, January 12, 2017 From Meryl Streep to George Clooney, here's what the celebrities have to say about President-elect Donald Trump. Getty•REUTERS 1 of 9 Meryl Streep and Hugh laurie both took a swipe at Donald Trump at the Golden Globes \n“The EU is big, it is bureaucratic, it is run by the unelected, it doesn’t have any sense of doing a deal, of getting on. And what I want us to be Josh, I want us to be flexible, I want us to be adaptable, I want us to move quickly and I think we need to recognise that actually, the days of this European project are numbered - it’s not working.” \nThe comments come after Mr Trump told Michael Gove he wanted to secure a “quick and proper” trade deal with the UK after Brexit in an interview for The Times. \nMr Farage said: \"For those of us who fought for Brexit , arguing that free from the European Union there was a big world out there we could start to engage with, what Donald Trump has said today confirmed everything I'd heard in my meetings in Trump Tower, not just with him but with his colleagues around him. \n\"We have got the opportunity here to strike a rapid trade deal with the United States of America. \n\"When I say rapid, I don't mean two years or five years or ten years. This could be done within 90 days. That is what the Americans want to do. We must not look this gift horse in the mouth.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:56:11.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
