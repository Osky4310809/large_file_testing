While the rest of us are still trying to wrap our heads around the idea that someone so flawless is 60, Calloway marked the major milestone by having a star-studded birthday bash.\n\nIt was attended by the star’s famous friends, including Tina Knowles-Lawson, Vivica A. Fox, Tika Sumpter, Debbie Allen, Star Jones, Kym Whitley, Cedric the Entertainer and more. Check out the room full of beautiful people who came to kick off Calloway’s sixth decade of life, including Calloway’s daughters Ashley and Alexandra, as well as her husband Anthony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our interview, when speaking with Calloway about what she was most excited about as she approached the 6-0, the star said she was just happy to have another year of life.\n“I’m just excited that I’m alive,” she said. “Whitney Houston will never see 60. We know that for a fact. Prince will never turn 60. We know that for a fact. So the fact that God has blessed me with another year, to have a great family, my girls are grown and doing well — I’m just excited about the next decade. Work is great. I mean, my life is good right now. I think a lot of it has to do with not only do I work hard, but I have a great energy and a good, positive outlook. So I’m most excited about continuing with my life and just embracing who I’m going to be in the next 10 years. I’m going to change a little bit, and I’ve already changed a little bit. You see things differently. Your body changes. But I’m excited to continue embracing who I am and to try to offer more of who I am to the world.”\nThe post We Still Don’t Believe It, But Vanessa Bell Calloway Turned 60 With Help From Her Famous Friends appeared first on MadameNoire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:31:53.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
