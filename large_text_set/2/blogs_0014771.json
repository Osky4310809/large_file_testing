Here are five lesser-known facts about the celebrated photographer. 1. AN EARTHQUAKE LED TO HIS DISTINCTIVE NOSE. \nAdams was a four-year-old tot when the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck his hometown. Although the boy managed to escape injury during the quake itself, an aftershock threw him face-first into a garden wall, breaking his nose. According to a 1979 interview with TIME , Adams said that doctors told his parents that it would be best to fix the nose when the boy matured. He joked, \"But of course I never did mature, so I still have the nose.\" The nose became Adams' most striking physical feature. His buddy Cedric Wright liked to refer to Adams' honker as his \" earthquake nose. \" 2. HE ALMOST BECAME A PIANIST. \nAdams was an energetic, inattentive student, and that trait coupled with a possible case of dyslexia earned him the heave-ho from private schools. It was clear, however, that he was a sharp boy—when motivated. \nWhen Adams was just 12 years old , he taught himself to play the piano and read music, and he quickly showed a great aptitude for it. For nearly a dozen years, Adams focused intensely on his piano training. He was still playful—he would end performances by jumping up and sitting on his piano—but he took his musical education seriously. Adams ultimately devoted over a decade to his study, but he eventually came to the realization that his hands simply weren't big enough for him to become a professional concert pianist. He decided to leave the keys for the camera after meeting photographer Paul Strand, much to his family's dismay. 3. HE HELPED CREATE A NATIONAL PARK. Amazon \nIf you've ever enjoyed Kings Canyon National Park in California, tip your cap to Adams. In the 1930s Adams took a series of photographs that eventually became the book Sierra Nevada: The John Muir Trail . When Adams sent a copy to Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, the cabinet member showed it to Franklin Roosevelt. The photographs so delighted FDR that he wouldn't give the book back to Ickes. Adams sent Ickes a replacement copy, and FDR kept his with him in the White House. \nAfter a few years, Ickes, Adams, and the Sierra Club successfully convinced Roosevelt to make Kings Canyon a national park in 1940. Roosevelt's designation specifically provided that the park be left totally undeveloped and roadless , so the only way FDR himself would ever experience it was through Adams' lenses. 4. HE WELCOMED COMMERCIAL ASSIGNMENTS. \nWhile many of his contemporary fine art photographers shunned commercial assignments as crass or materialistic, Adams went out of his way to find paying gigs. If a company needed a camera for hire, Adams would generally show up, and as a result, he had some unlikely clients. According to The Ansel Adams Gallery , he snapped shots for everyone from IBM to AT&T to women's colleges to a dried fruit company. All of this commercial print work dismayed Adams' mentor Alfred Stieglitz and even worried Adams when he couldn't find time to work on his own projects. It did, however, keep the lights on. 5. HE AND GEORGIA O'KEEFFE WERE FRIENDS. \nAdams and legendary painter O'Keeffe were pals and occasional traveling buddies who found common ground despite their very different artistic approaches . They met through their mutual friend/mentor Stieglitz—who eventually became O'Keeffe's husband—and became friends who traveled throughout the Southwest together during the 1930s. O'Keeffe would paint while Adams took photographs. \nThese journeys together led to some of the artists' best-known work, like Adams' portrait of O'Keeffe and a wrangler named Orville Cox , and while both artists revered nature and the American Southwest, Adams considered O'Keeffe the master when it came to capturing the area. \n“The Southwest is O’Keeffe’s land,” he wrote . “No one else has extracted from it such a style and color, or has revealed the essential forms so beautifully as she has in her paintings.” \nThe two remained close throughout their lives. Adams would visit O'Keeffe's ranch, and the two wrote to each other until Adams' death in 1984.
