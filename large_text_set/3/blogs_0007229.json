A post shared by Adore Delano (@adoredelano) on Feb 20, 2017 at 11:16pm PST \n\nAdore, 27, was even able to beat RuPaul to the 1 million mark. (As of the writing of this article, RuPaul has 984k followers on Instagram .) \nThis milestone marks the second time Adore has set a drag queen record. In 2014, her debut album, ‘Till Death Do Us Party,’ sold over 5,000 copies in its first week, making it the biggest first week sales log of any former RuPaul’s Drag Race contestant. \nNow, the race to 2 million begins. \nDo you think Adore will be able to be the first to get a second million, or is there another rising queen who could surpass her?
