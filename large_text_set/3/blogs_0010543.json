Begum Jaan trailer is trending and it's not for nothing 2015 Pujo was his and by the looks of Begum Jaan's trailer, Poila Boishak 2017 is going to be in Srijit Mukherjee's favour too. TNN | Updated: Mar 14, 2017, 06.18 PM IST 2015 Pujo was his and by the looks of Begum Jaan's trailer, Poila Boishak 2017 is going to be in Srijit Mukherjee's favour too. Post releasing intriguing posters and character teasers, Srijit Mukherjee has finally released the official trailer of Begum Jaan which is nothing is that powerful. Vidya Balan plays the title role of Begum Jaan, a brothel's madam, in this dramatic remake of Rajkahini. The film is set in the backdrop of India's Independence period of 1947 but unlike Rajkahini that was set in Bengal , Begum Jaan is set in Punjab. Vidya's portrayal of the brothel's owner, her demeanor and dialogue delivery is sure to leave you awestruck and marvel at the actress' acting chops. Begum Jaan is a story of survival set against the backdrop of the Partition. The trailer opens with a monologue by Amitabh Bachchan -- a baritone that adds to the power of the film's narrative. The scene cuts to Vidya as the fiery Begum Jaan, a brothel owner. When the agents of Partition threaten to tear down Begum Jaan's brothel, she and the other prostitutes retaliate with all they have, earning the respect of the very men who see them as nothing more than objects of pleasure. Begum Jaan and the other women vow not to give up their house without a fight. Begum Jaan also stars Naseeruddin Shah , Gauahar Khan, Pallavi Sharda, Ila Arun, Chunky Pandey among others in important roles. Comparisons between Vidya and Rituparna Sengupta (who played the title role in Rajkahini) are already rife on social media. Many are of the opinion that Rituparna did a better job of the role. Now, now, it's just the trailer! May be, both the actresses are just as good, something which only time will tell!
