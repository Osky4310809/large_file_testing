We will work with Ali Modu Sheriff and go to a convention. \n“Right now, PDP is on a course towards destruction and abiding by the judgement of the court is the only thing that can save us. \n“In the first place, it is never the job of the judiciary to choose the leader of a party. I therefore call an end to the fighting. \n“And I am supporting Ali Modu Sheriff because it is the only way to preserve the party. Right now, what Nigeria has is a one-party state – there is no opposition. Enough is enough. This is the time for PDP to unite, we are a formidable force!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:33:14.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
