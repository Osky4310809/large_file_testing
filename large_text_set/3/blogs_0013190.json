Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mum has asked other parents if she's being unreasonable to be angry with her childminder after the shock confession she made while caring for her seven-month-old baby. \nThe anonymous mother, writing on Mumsnet , explained that she had been picking up her daughter when the childminder told her how her baby had fallen backwards and bumped her head. \nSo far, so normal. It's a common occurrence with little ones and sometimes it can't be helped. \nExcept this time, it could be helped. \nShe explained: \"What threw [me] was that she said she was there behind her and she let her fall - she's got to learn not to do it again. \n\"I was quite abrupt and said that sofa surfing is a normal developmental stage and said that if you're there next time, pull her down don't just let her fall.\" \nThe mum was clearly upset about the situation, adding: \"Yes I know babies fall, it's natural but to deliberately let a seven-month-old fall back and bump her head doesn't sit right with me.\" The mum didn't say if her daughter (not pictured) had any lasting symptoms (Photo: Getty) \nAnother Mumsnet user, who herself is a childminder, didn't agree with it at all. She said: \"I'm a childminder and this is pretty shocking! \n\"Little ones fall and get bumps, but I would never intentionally allow a child to fall and injure themselves.\" Read More What is the Eraser Challenge? The dark online craze among children parents should be worried about \nOther mums said they \"wouldn't be happy with it at all\" and advised her to find a new childminder. \nOne wrote: \"Dangerous. If shed really hurt herself...what then? Would she have admitted she deliberately let her fall?\" \nAnother expressed concern for the welfare of the baby, commenting: \"In your position I would be losing my sh**. H\"ead injuries can be very serious and going by the OP [original poster] your CM [childminder] is irresponsible and should not be in charge of children. \n\"How's DD [dear daughter] any bruising, unusual behaviour, sickness etc? Keep an eye on her please.\" \nHave you ever had a similar experience?
