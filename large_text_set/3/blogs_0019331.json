It is a little bit frustrating, but injuries are part of football. \n\"Unfortunately my injury is a long-term injury, it takes quite a few months to recover, but I am okay with that. That is fine for me, I work hard. \n\"I just try to do the best every day and try to come back as soon as possible on the field. Hopefully I can start pre-season.\" \nGundogan was talking in New York, where he and also-injured City forward Gabriel Jesus were promoting City's matches in the International Champions Cup this summer.
