who had already served more than a year of bans for various acts of on-field violence before his latest indiscretion - that established the new regime's modus operandi. \nWhere Lancaster had spoken of his players being \"ambassadors\", Jones introduced Hartley praising his \"passion\", \"aggression\" and \"uncompromising approach\". \nA wretched World Cup campaign had revealed England's soft underbelly. By promoting Hartley, Jones gave his side a hard-nosed ideal to aspire to and the street smarts to succeed. \nFormer England hooker Brian Moore, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said: \"Eddie Jones has identified something that had been obvious to many outside the England camp for a while - England work hard, give their all, but there is no edge. \n\"We're not talking about illegality, we're talking about the controlled belligerence that is the hallmark of players such as Eben Etzebeth, Ma'a Nonu and Scott Fardy.\" 14 February 2016: George shows the way Owen Farrell (left) and Jamie George (right) are Saracens and England team-mates \nFor the first match and a half under Jones, England had been effective but not inspirational. \nAfter scrapping their way to victory over Scotland in their Six Nations opener, the first half in Rome had been far from the St Valentine's Day massacre England fans might have hoped for under the new coach. \nEngland had scored one try and led by a slender two points. But the second half saw a more ambitious, 15-man game emerge, with replacement hooker Jamie George's cutting angle and slick offload to Owen Farrell for the final try the clearest sign of Jones renewing England's licence to attack by instinct rather than the playbook. \n\"This is more like it, England cutting loose,\" enthused BBC commentator Eddie Butler as Farrell crossed. \nJones' England have now scored 46 tries in 13 games - an average of 3.5 a match, better than predecessors Lancaster (2.1), Martin Johnson (2.1), Brian Ashton (1.9) and Andy Robinson (2.9).

Under Jones, Farrell was given the chance to show his craft could provide a more subtle midfield weapon, while offering a solid defensive presence as well. \nThe perfectly weighted miss-pass that picked off Robbie Henshaw's rush defence and opened Mike Brown's route to the line against Ireland was typical of the way he seized his chance.

But he has imposed himself with relentless industry and physicality. \nHis colossal hit on Pocock in the first two minutes of the first Test of the summer series against Australia set the tone for a bruising 39-28 win and showed how a perceived area of weakness had turned to a strength for England. \nThat it was Haskell - ebullient, driven, and not necessarily everyone's cup of tea - leading from the front was especially significant. \nMarginalised under the Lancaster regime, Jones put him front and centre and gave him a very specific brief - smash everyone who comes near you, hammer every ruck you can, and run hard and straight when you get the ball. \nThe result? With his confidence high and a focused gameplan, Haskell was man of the series down under, despite injury forcing him out just after the hour mark of the second Test. 25 June 2016: Harrison is hauled off Teimana Harrison suffered the same fate that befell Luther Burrell in the first Test down under \nTeimana Harrison's parents had flown over from New Zealand to see their son make only his second start for England, in the third Test in Sydney. \nThe match was only 31 minutes old when he was replaced in a tactical switch by Jones. \n\"I don't see it as a big deal,\" explained Jones when asked about the possible damage to the young flanker's confidence. \nJones was similarly blunt with defence coach Paul Gustard, telling him he \"has got to get better\". \nAll this in the wake of scoring 44 points to seal a historic whitewash in Sydney. \nThere is no concession to reputation or sentiment - either in public words or private decision-making - as Jones drives England on and up. \nHe is ruthless in pursuit of victory and more importantly, brutal as they may be, his tactical changes work, as the withdrawal of Luther Burrell in the first Test after half an hour in favour of Ford also demonstrated. In the wake of Brexit, Australian newspaper the Courier Mail took England's first whitewash series win over Australia well... 26 November 2016: Daly sees red Daly was sent off for this tackle on Senatore \nWhen Elliot Daly recklessly charged into the airborne Leonardo Senatore less than five minutes into England's autumn Test against Argentina, it set England an unexpected, but not unwelcome challenge. \nDown to 14 men with 75 minutes to play, there was an immediate premium on discipline and defensive concentration. \nAfter a nine-try demolition of Fiji the previous weekend, England had to think on their feet, adapt and survive to keep their winning run alive. \nArgentina, while not in the form that carried them to the World Cup semi-finals in 2015, looked ominous as they moved to within two points early in the second half. \nBut England's composure and conditioning passed the examination in a 27-14 win. \nIt was a red letter day for England, one that showed them they could adapt to straitened circumstances on the fly and work out how to win despite the odds being stacked against them. In the future, this may be pin-pointed as the moment the team grew up. Former England hooker and qualified solicitor passes judgement on the Daly incident The dates that will define England's Six Nations 4 February: France at HQ \nFrance were demolished 62-13 by the All Blacks at the 2015 World Cup, but gave the world champions a scare with a late fightback in Paris in November, coming up just short in a 24-19 defeat. \nFrance have not won at Twickenham since 2005, however the mood takes their talented individuals they can poop any party. 11 February: Wales away \nThere were only tentative pokes - rather than the expected all-out verbal jousting - between Jones and Wales' counterpart Warren Gatland last year. \nThis time around, with Gatland on British and Irish Lions duty, it will be Rob Howley plotting England's downfall . Last time the interim head coach stepped up to the plate, he delivered in style with England sent spiralling to a 30-3 defeat in 2013. 18 March: Ireland in Dublin \nThe fixture list throws up a trip to Dublin on the final weekend for England - just at it did in 2013. \nEngland were on for a Grand Slam that year, but were on the wrong end of a 24-8 scoreline by the time the final whistle blew. After wins over the three southern hemisphere superpowers in 2016, Joe Schmidt's side will fear no-one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:57:53.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
