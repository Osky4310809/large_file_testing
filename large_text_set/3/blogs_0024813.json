This one week wait currently only applies to people applying for Newstart or Sickness Allowance, but under the new bill will apply to those under 22 and people applying for parenting payments as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:21:17.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
