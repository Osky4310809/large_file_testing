Credit Kim Won-Jin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images North Korea is well known for provocative acts aimed at its most immediate adversaries — South Korea, the United States and Japan. But Kim Jong-un , the 33-year-old leader who took over in 2012 after his father died, also has sent increasingly blunt messages of defiance and even hostility to China, the North’s ally, protector and provider, vexing the Chinese as well. Based on their timing, the North Korean actions — whether they be a missile launch, nuclear test, execution or propaganda campaign — often seem like more than coincidence. Here is a sampling from the past decade: A July 4 missile launch As the United States celebrated Independence Day in 2006, North Korea test-fired seven ballistic missiles including the Taepo Dong 2, its longest-range missile, in what the State Department called a provocative act.

A nuclear test amid Lunar New Year celebrations On Feb. 11 , 2013, less than two weeks after the United Nations Security Council expanded sanctions on North Korea for a satellite launch, and in the midst of China’s Lunar New Year holiday, North Korea confirmed it had conducted its third nuclear test.

Credit Wong Maye-E/Associated Press An execution follows outreach to China On Dec. 12, 2013, North Korea announced the execution of Jang Song-thaek, Mr. Kim’s uncle and mentor, who was considered close to China and had actively sought advice from Chinese leaders on economic matters. Mr. Jang was accused of treason and corruption. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Midrange missiles are launched after three-way talks On March 25 , 2014 , North Korea tested two midrange missiles, the first such launch in five years, hours after the United States, South Korea and Japan held an extraordinary three-way summit meeting to discuss the North’s nuclear buildup.

Two months later, concerts in China by an all-girl pop band from North Korea that had been intended to improve relations were abruptly canceled .

On Sept. 8 of that year, less than a week after China hosted a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, North Korea conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test.

The missile used solid fuel, which disarmament experts called a significant advance. A few days later, Mr. Kim’s estranged older half brother, Kim Jong-nam , who had been living in exile under China’s protection, was assassinated at an airport in Malaysia. His death came amid rumors that China might have been preparing him to take over in case North Korea’s government collapsed. North Korea denied responsibility. On March 20 , North Korea tested a revved-up rocket engine, a few days after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson warned in South Korea that the Trump administration might take pre-emptive military action if the North Koreans elevated “the threat of their weapons program” to a level deemed unacceptable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:11:14.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
