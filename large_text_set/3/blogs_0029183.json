  \nA Chinese firm has been brought in by the government to run one of the biggest rail franchises in the country. \nThe surprise move will see Hong Kong Metro operator MTR run South West Trains (SWT) with the giant First Group for seven years from August. \nTransport Secretary Chris Grayling announced the decision in a bid to boost punctuality and reliability. \nHe said: \"MTR run one of the world’s busiest metro services in Hong Kong, on which 99.9 per cent of journeys run on time. \n\"The new operator will bring about a transformation for people travelling in and around London.\" \nFirst MTR will take over from Stagecoach , which currently runs SWT services across south east England to and from London Waterloo. \nBut the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said the Chinese state was now set to make \"a killing at the British taxpayers’ expense.\" \nThe RMT said the move intensified foreign ownership of Britain’s railways.

Passengers can look forward to more space.\" Read More Next stop, the kitchen...
