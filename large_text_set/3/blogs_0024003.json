We recently spotted the couple looking uber stylish at a restaurant in Bandra. Shilpa was dressed in lime green satin top paired with a textured black, ankle length skirt. She styled this look with a broad waist-belt, black heels and an Alexander McQueen clutch. While we have ALWAYS loved how Shilpa dresses, this time we thought Raj Kundra’s style caught our attention more than it usually does. \nWearing dark blue denims, paired with a blue hues cameo short, he opted for blue loafers for this look. We love how he went all monotone with his choice. \nWe preferred Mr.Kundra’s here as we’re used to Shilpa always looking fabulous. Who did you prefer between the two?
