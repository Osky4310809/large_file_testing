Austin has been missing for Southampton since December (Photo: Getty) \nAustin, who cost Southampton £4million in January 2016, has not been arrested - although road traffic accident investigations can take months before the driver is issued with court summons. \nAustin says the incident was “extremely regrettable\" and in a statement declared: \n“In late October 2016, I was driving in the city centre of Southampton and had stopped at traffic lights at a junction. \n“I moved forward when the lights turned green and it was at that point that a cyclist unexpectedly came across my path and a collision occurred. \n“Following a police investigation of the accident, I provided a statement to the Hampshire Constabulary in early 2017 to give them my version of events.” Austin will miss Saints' trip to Wembley later this month (Photo: Reuters) \nAustin is currently out of action for four months, after suffering a shoulder injury in December. \nHampshire Police have declined to comment.
