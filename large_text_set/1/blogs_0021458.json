Stern serving guests at his newly opened glatt kosher deli, the Deli, in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami. Credit Brian Smith for The New York Times Zak H. Stern, a.k.a. Zak the Baker, opened his new glatt kosher deli in the second week of January and closed it, locking the door, after just five hours. He had run out of food.

Credit Brian Smith for The New York Times He sent customers down the block to his spacious new bakery, which originally occupied the deli’s location, for breads and pastry. The deli, which he simply calls the Deli, opened unannounced to his devoted following, who discovered that it had replaced the bakery. It was a project he had been thinking about for quite some time. “I was tired of trendy food like avocado toast,” said Mr. Stern, a 31-year-old native of Miami. “This community needs a good kosher deli, and there’s not enough people doing Ashkenazi, Eastern European food.

So he is brining his own corned beef, with fairly mild results, then slicing it — on the thick side because he feels the flavor comes through better — and layering it on his excellent Jewish corn rye bread. Some of the food was inspired by Will Horowitz’s Ducks Eatery in the East Village of Manhattan. Pastrami is in the works. His chef is Melissa Sosa, a 25-year-old whose parents were Cuban immigrants. Mr. Stern, who apprenticed in Europe and Israel, started baking in a South Miami garage in 2012 and sold his bread in farmers’ markets. Then he moved to a commissary bakery and finally to the Wynwood arts district , known for its lavish graffiti walls. He calls the new venture his “dream bakery.” There, he will eventually make bialys, another item on the list of Jewish culinary traditions he is helping to keep alive.
