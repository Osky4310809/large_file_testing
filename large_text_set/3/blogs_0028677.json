It would be a first for Pennsylvania. \nHere’s how Nasir Fears describes his teenage years in Philadelphia. \n“It was survival of the fittest,” he said. “Any way I can try to survive I would do it — sleeping on the sub(way) or house-hopping.” \nFears says he became homeless at age 14 when he came out to his custodial grandparents, whose religious beliefs clashed with his sexual orientation. \nREAD: City On First ICE List Refusing Requests To Detain Criminal Illegal Immigrants \nIt’s not an uncommon story. Youth, 18 to 23, are among the fastest-growing segment of the homeless — and a disproportionate 40 percent are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. That’s why Project HOME is building the new residence and why the Philadelphia Foundation gave it initial funding of $100,000, says president Pedro Ramos. \n“Today’s announcement is a milestone in an ongoing collaboration to solve a solvable challenge,” Ramos said. \nThe project still needs $13-million and Project HOME officials worry about the impact of housing cuts in the federal budget but still hope to break ground in September.
