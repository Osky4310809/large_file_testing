I got some things wrong and I have got a lot of homework to do over the weekend. I will make sure the team plays much better against Wales. Highlights of England's opening Six Nations clash with France \n\"I thought we were awful, but I thought we were always going to win the game, and that is what I like about these boys. They have got a never-say-die attitude. \n\"They keep at it even when they are not playing well and things are not going right. \n\"It looked like we hadn't practised, but these things happen and we will get through it.\" James Haskell came off the bench to make a big impact against France \nThe likes of James Haskell, fit again after injury, and Te'o came off the replacements' bench to good effect for England. \nJones added: \"The bench definitely made a difference. \n\"Haskell, for a guy that has played 35 minutes and 35 seconds this year, was brilliant, and Ben Te'o did really well for us, too. I thought it was a great result from our 23. \n\"We have got a very strong bench and the fact we have four of our top-class forwards out and we can still bring on a bench that makes a difference is a great testament to the depth of the squad. \n\"It is our first game of the tournament and we will improve.\" A look at some of the key talking points ahead of Wales' Six Nations outing \nEngland have set a national record for wins in a row but Jones wants another Six Nations title and knows improvement will be needed when they face Wales in Cardiff next Saturday. \n\"Records don't mean anything\" said Jones. \"You score 100 in a Test and next day get out for a duck. \n\"We want to be Six Nations champions and that starts now by beating Wales next week, and that is the only thing that matters. \n\"If we win the Six Nations I will stand up here and do handstands. I will be that happy.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:12:12.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
