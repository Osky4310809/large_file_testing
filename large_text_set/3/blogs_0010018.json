I had a hard time articulating myself! So you gotta go... I was like, 'I... you... you... aaa '\" \nDevy added: \"Here's the best example of that: we did The Tonight Show. Management at this time was this really famous dude who did not get me. So we did The Tonight Show and the day before they put me in this thing where I'm supposed to rehearse all these moves, the whole lead singer shit. \n\"They had me looking at pictures of Axl Rose and I'm going, '... I hate this.' They spent a bunch of money to give me these big fake dreadlocks and whatever was hip at the time. \n\"So the day before The Tonight Show, me and my buddy Mark who's still one of my best friends - we shaved all of my hair. I shaved my eyebrows, I went to Walmart and got a pair of gray shorts and wrote my buddies' names all over myself - arms and everything.\" \nFocusing on how he got to the backstage with the band and his buddy Mark, Devin added: \"We were like, 'These guys suck. This sucks.' And Steve's in a shitty mood and Jay Leno's like, *funny voice* 'How you doin' kid?' So Mark's like, 'We should fuck with them.' \n\"So we went into the backroom, there's an office there, a green room, a phone and all this stuff. So we locked the door, I took all my clothes off and started doing all these poses and Mark's like, 'You should stick that phone up your ass.' So I did and we took a photo and it's online. \n\"If you look up online 'Devin Townsend phone in ass,' it's a picture of me in the back room of The Tonight Show with a phone up my ass. //it's not there, unfortunately :( // We thought it was funny! \n\"So we left, thinking nothing of it. We went to Jay Leno's desk, taking pictures mooning... Anyway, next morning, phone rings, management was like, 'What, in the fuck, were you guys doing?!' \n\"And I was like, 'We played the show? What?' He's like, 'I can't believe you did that! Did you stick the phone up your ass? Why would you do that?' I was like, 'No, I didn't,' but they had it on camera. 'They've got all these images of you with a phone up your ass and now we can't come back!' \n\"So we went on tour after that, Steve by this point was thoroughly confused with my guitar pick saying, 'Don't use Jay's phone.'\" \nThe more you know... \nAlthough Google Images displays no images of Devy with the phone //there is one right below in the comments now, tho. Thanks, bodom_reaper!// , footage of hairless Devy rocking out with the boys on the show is available, you can watch it below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:42:01.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
