Porto beat Leicester 5-0 at home in the Champions League group stage \nThe Estadio do Dragao will host the first leg of the contest on Wednesday night, with Porto looking for a first win in four matches against the Italian giants. \nBut the hosts are also in good form, having won their last six matches in all competitions. \nPorto midfielder Danilo told La Repubblica : \"FC Porto and Juventus are two teams in different realities. \n\"We have to sell the best players, they can simply buy. There are big differences in terms of budgets, but the ambition is the same. Porto finished second in their Champions League group behind Leicester \n\"We are very organised defensively and in attack we have young players who can make a difference, but our great strength is the spirit of camaraderie that exists between us. \n\"Certainly the atmosphere of the Dragao will make a difference. We play every game as if it were our last.\" Team news \nJuventus have been boosted by the return to fitness of key defenders Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli, who were both included in the squad after recovering from thigh injuries. \nThe tie also features two of football's greatest goalkeepers, as Porto's Iker Casillas comes up against Juventus 'keeper Gianluigi Buffon. Gianluigi Buffon and Iker Casillas are set to face each another once again Opta stats \nJuventus are unbeaten against Porto (W2 D1). They beat them in the 1984 Cup Winners' Cup final (2-1), and recorded a win (3-1) and a draw (0-0) when they met in the 2001/02 Champions League first group stage. \nNo Italian side has won any of their last five trips to Porto in the Champions League (four draws followed by one defeat). The last victory dates back to March 1993 (Porto 0-1 AC Milan). Gonzalo Higuain (far left) has scored three goals in five Champions League appearances this season \nJuventus topped their group for the first time since the 2012/13 season, while Porto have reached the knockout stages of the Champions League for the seventh time in their last 10 appearances in the competition. \nHowever, Porto have made it past the round of 16 only once in their last six Champions League appearances (2014/15), while Juventus have done it only once over the last three years (2014/15). \nPorto have lost only one of their 14 Champions League knockout games at home (W7 D6), against Manchester United in April 2009 (0-1). \nPorto have also only failed to score once in their last 12 Champions League games at the Dragao, against Dynamo Kiev in November 2015 (0-2). \nPorto have kept a clean sheet in each of their last three Champions League games, the longest current run among all 16 teams left in this season's competition.

Porto have lost only one of their 14 Champions League knockout games at home - they are 13/5 for the win. The draw is a 2/1 chance. \nJamie Redknapp thinks Juventus will have a comfortable evening and win 1-0 with Higuain bagging the first goal. You can get 13/1 for that scenario to happen.
