This is the third confirmed report of a mountain lion in Missouri since November. The photos were taken by Garrett Jensen of Chesterfield with a trail camera. Photo by Garrett Jensen \nThe elk carcass bore the signs of a mountain lion kill. \nEven though such a predator-prey showdown might sound like a scene from Yellowstone, this one was discovered last February in Shannon County, Mo., in the Ozarks, where both animals have resurfaced in recent years — the elk through a reintroduction program and the mountain lions as occasional visitors that stray into the state from afar. \n“I never thought I’d see it in my career that we’ve got mountain lions eating elk in our state,” said Tom Meister, a veteran biologist for the Missouri Department of Conservation. \nBut the biggest surprise came almost a year later, when state wildlife biologists got lab results back from the scene of the kill. Traces of mountain lion saliva confirmed the identity of the culprit, but the saliva’s DNA revealed that it was a female cat — the first to be confirmed in Missouri since the state started documenting reports of the species in 1994. \nThe MDC announcement on Jan. 27 of the female’s presence has renewed conversation among wildlife biologists and other mountain lion experts about whether the cats that wander in from the West can establish a breeding population in Missouri for the first time in nearly a century. \nThough Missouri’s native mountain lions have been considered locally extinct since the 1920s, the species’ dispersal from more densely populated enclaves in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska has led some to return, at least as guests. \nSince the state began monitoring the cats’ activity in the ’90s, it has confirmed 68 reports of them around Missouri. Many of those are concentrated in the Ozarks, but they’ve occurred in places all across the state, including St. Louis County . \n“We believe they’re just wandering males for the most part — up until this female,” said Dan Zarlenga, an MDC spokesman. \nIn established populations out West, adult males force younger male mountain lions out of their territory once they reach a certain age. Those displaced males then set out in search of new territory where they can find a mate. \nBut with few, if any, females in the Eastern U.S. — save for the extremely isolated sub-population of Florida panthers — young, eastbound males keep going, enduring odysseys that can take them hundreds and even thousands of miles. \nIn 2011, for instance, one of the roving male cats was killed by a car in Greenwich, Conn., just about 20 miles from New York City. DNA traced the cat’s heritage to the Black Hills region and linked the same individual to clues spread along a path of more than 3,000 miles. \nMissouri is right along the path of many of the mountain lions. \n“Missouri does seem to be one of the hot spots for cats heading east from their range in the Rockies,” said Will Stolzenburg, the author of a book published last year about the Connecticut lion’s journey . \nMissouri’s transient cats are almost always condemned to the same fate of futility: struck down while searching in vain for a mate. \n“We don’t have any evidence of these animals surviving for very long,” said Stolzenburg. “It seems to be a one-way trip.” \nSuch was the case when, on Jan. 21, MDC confirmed that a young male was struck and killed by a vehicle along Interstate 70 in Warren County. \nBut males may finally have reason to take up more permanent residence now that a female has made a surprising appearance in the state. \n“To have females do this, this is really unusual,” Stolzenburg said. “They usually set up really close to their home territory. They usually set up next to Mom.” \nAt the time his book was published in April, Stolzenburg says he was aware of only seven or eight females striking off east of the species’ known breeding range , including one that turned up as far away as Tennessee . \nThe sudden appearance of one in Missouri is raising some interesting theories. \n“It has some people wondering, ‘I wonder if this is a second-generation cat?’” Stolzenburg said. “These are all tantalizing questions, but it’s all speculation.” \nThe DNA from the female cat suggests she’s from the Black Hills area. But John Laundre, a mountain lion biologist who has authored his own book on the eastward movement of the species , said even mountain lions born across the Plains would show those genetics. \n“They’re all going to be Dakota-stock animals,” he said. \nHis guess, though, is that the female is originally from either western or central Nebraska. \n“Those areas can’t really support that many cats,” Laundre said. “We’re starting to see that population pressure kind of moving females to the East.” \nBecause the Ozarks’ location and amount of available habitat, Laundre believes they are a prime candidate for a new breeding population to take root. \n“I think in terms of cats and females establishing east of the Plains, the Ozarks is the ideal place,” Laundre said. And if mountain lions were to gain a toehold there, he believes it “has the best potential as a generational stepping stone” for continued eastward colonization by the species. \nState wildlife officials emphasize that they don’t want to re-establish a breeding population of the cats in Missouri. But while they won’t lay out the welcome mat with any restocking efforts, nothing is being done to deter them, either. They’re simply monitoring the species and “letting nature take its course,” Zarlenga said. \nStolzenburg says the female lion may spare the state from any contentious debate about reintroduction by reproducing naturally. \n“That would certainly circumvent a lot of the political headaches of translocation,” Stolzenburg said. \nHe recognizes the improbability of a pair of mountain lions both surviving the same gantlet to breed east of the Plains. But, he points out, the species has a tendency to defy the odds. \n“Never say never,” Stolzenburg said. “Who would’ve thought that an animal could make it to Greenwich, Conn.?” \nLaundre, meanwhile, is optimistic that the female will find a mate and thinks some breeding could take place. But such a small population, he warns, would still be very precarious. \n“You just never know,” he said. “They could catch on or they could blink out.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:26:34.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
