This is thought to be a considerable blow to militants clinging to a former stronghold and self-imposed caliphate. \nBrigadier General Mahdi Abbas Abdullah of the Rapid Response force said, \"We are still moving toward the Iron Bridge. We are taking out snipers hiding in the surrounding buildings, we are still pushing for the Iron Bridge.\" ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T02:44:29.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
