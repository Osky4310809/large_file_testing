Nydia [Salazar's daughter] was able to attend a college-prep high school, graduate this year with honors and go on to college.\" \nDeVos was chair of the American Federation for Children, a pro-school choice group. She's also financially supported several other school choice organizations. \nSalazar immigrated to the U.S. from Peru. Her letter refers to individual income tax credits that Arizona gives to those who donate to nonprofit groups that give scholarships to students in need. As of the 2014-15 school year, 16,493 students got scholarships thanks to the tax credits. \n\"I don't claim to know Betsy DeVos personally,\" Salazar wrote in closing, \"but her work to provide opportunities is very personal to me, and I know my daughter's success is very personal to her.\" \nSalazar's letter responded to a teacher's op-ed that warned readers to \"beware of Betsy DeVos.\" \nJason Russell is the contributors editor for the Washington Examiner.
