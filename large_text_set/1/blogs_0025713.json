It was such anti-oil producing communities policies by Shell, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and other multinationals operating in the Niger Delta region that gave birth to the present restiveness in the Niger Delta region. The implication of Shell relocating its corporate headquarters from the Niger Delta to Lagos is that the region would lose all the economic and other associated benefits that come with having a corporate headquarters in the region. The Niger Delta states would not only lose revenue but even businessmen doing business with Shell had to move from the Niger Delta region to Lagos with the attendant negative economic effects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T11:45:39.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
