We want this award to stand as a symbol of the unity between nations and the freedom of the arts.” \nThe filmmakers wrote: “The fear generated by dividing us into genders, colors, religions and sexualities as a means to justify violence destroys the things that we depend on – not only as artists but as humans: the diversity of cultures, the chance to be enriched by something seemingly ‘foreign’ and the belief that human encounters can change us for the better. These divisive walls prevent people from experiencing something simple but fundamental: from discovering that we are all not so different.” \n“The Salesman” follows an Iranian couple who are forced to move to a new apartment after a violent incident.
