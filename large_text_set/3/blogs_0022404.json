You can't even make a movie about an Amazonian warrior princess who can hold her own with the likes of Superman and Batman without wounding the feelings of a modern feminist, because something about that warrior princess will still not be \"progressive\" enough.\nFor example: Wonder Woman has shaved her armpits , and THAT IS NOT OK:\nTwitter exploded at the revelation, claiming women of the fictional matriarchy Themyscira would probably not shave their armpits . Some speculated that Gadot’s armpits were photoshopped to show a sheen, immaculate visage, unattainable by real women.\nMany woke, intersectional journalists were also angered by the lack of gross armpit hair.\n“Is this seriously still happening in 2017,” cried Slate .\n“Do better!\" crowed the Revelist .\nRefinery29 even pined for a day when Wonder Woman could “prove that women -- even those who are superheroes -- don’t have to cater to beauty standards that are meant to make them more attractive to men.”\nSeriously, this is the WORST THING IN THE WORLD.\nAnd that's very illustrative of what they are still trying to call \"feminist\" these days. If whether or not a fictional superhero is a feminist if she shaves her armpits apparently has something to do with the quality of a woman's life in the West, then THE ACTUAL QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOMEN IN THE WEST IS AWESOME.\nOf course, it's hysterical that no progressive is complaining that Gal Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman, is gorgeous . After all, isn't her standard of beauty \"unattainable by real women\"?\n'Hollywood Reporter' Uses Natalie Portman to 'Sh*t on Israel'\nComplaining that a woman chosen for this role partly due to her beauty has shaved her pits is possibly the most stupid thing humanly possible under those circumstances.\nThen again, these progressives are the kind of people who have already said they will boycott the movie anyway -- because Gal Gadot supports Israel, and worse, she's an actual Israeli.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/20/latest-snowflake-outrage-wonder-woman-has-no-armpit-hair/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.refinery29.com/2017/03/144823/wonder-woman-trailer-origin-story-gal-gadot", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/03/15/were_gal_gadot_s_armpits_digitally_bleached_in_the_wonder_woman_trailer.html", "https://twitter.com/paulidin/status/840798480050278401", "http://www.revelist.com/movies/wonder-woman-photoshopped-armpits/7173", "https://heatst.com/entertainment/people-are-actually-mad-that-wonder-woman-gal-gadot-has-no-armpit-hair/"], "published": "2017-03-20T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:10:59.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
