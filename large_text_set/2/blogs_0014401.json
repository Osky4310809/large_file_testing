But can you stoner-proof your drone? That’s what the San Francisco inventors at Vantage Robotics set out to achieve. The unorthodox R&D landed them first prize at Richard Branson’s Extreme Tech Challenge, which means we’ll all be able to buy stoner-proof drones by March 1. \nVantage Robotics founder Tobin Fisher told Inverse that he conceptualized the idea of a drone with caged propeller blades because he kept cutting himself on the blades of other drones during launch. So he set out to make a drone durable enough to withstand the abuse of a truly aloof user, which is why he took the creation to San Francisco’s stoner central: Haight Street at Golden Gate Park.
