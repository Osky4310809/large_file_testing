He refuses to sit by and watch a billionaire owner smear a local basketball legend with what he views as egregious and false accusations. \nHooshangi is the owner of American Whiskey, a bar located on W 30th St. On Wednesday night, around 45 minutes before the Clippers and Knicks tipped off three blocks away at the Garden, Hooshangi watched as Charles Oakley walked into his bar to join friends at a table. According to Hooshangi, Oakley stayed at the establishment for around 15 to 20 minutes. During that time, Oakley showed no signs of inebriation. And as far as Hooshangi can tell - based on his own observations and detailed discussions with his employees - Oakley \"didn't drink at all while he was there or order any drinks.\" \nHooshangi's account to the Daily News of Oakley's demeanor Wednesday night varies greatly from that of James Dolan's. Less than an hour after his stint at American Whiskey, Oakley arrived at the Garden. He was then removed from the Knicks' home arena in the first quarter after a physical altercation with security. On Friday, Dolan indefinitely banned Oakley from the Garden while claiming the former Knicks power forward has \"problems.\" Dolan specifically mentioned a possible alcohol issue. \nDolan said Oakley was behaving in an \"abusive manner.\" He insinuated Oakley was acting drunk and unruly. But Hooshangi was adamant Oakley displayed none of that conduct while at American Whiskey minutes before the incident occurred. Oakley admitted to Fox 5 that he \"had a couple of drinks\" before arriving at the Garden. Charles Oakley is arrested at last Wednesday's Knicks game. (Frank Franklin II/AP) \n\"The normal telltale signs we look for, being abusive, being overly talkative, overly happy, there was none of that,\" Hooshangi told the News. \"There was no stumbling, no confrontations, nothing like that. And he couldn't be happier to pose for pictures, talk to people, shake their hands. If he was drunk, he possessed none of the signs that we see. We see it every day. Every day there are people in there, and we see drunk, we see sober and we see everything in between.\" \n\"He wasn't drunk,\" Hooshangi continued, with conviction in his voice. \"There comes a time when you feel obliged to say something. And that's sort of how I felt about it.\" \nHooshangi found Dolan's comments on alcoholism disturbing, considering he encounters individuals who suffer from drinking problems on a daily basis. Dolan himself is a recovering alcoholic. James Dolan insinuates Oakley may have an 'alcohol problem.' (Frank Franklin II/AP) \n\"People throw terms around. They throw alcoholism around. They throw things like that around,\" he said. \"And when this is your business, not only do we have to monitor it, we see it. We actually see a lot of the ups and downs of these sort of conditions.\" \nLatrell Sprewell explains reunion with James Dolan at Knicks game \nHooshangi felt it was his duty to tell the version of events he witnessed Wednesday night. \n\"When you sign a lease and you open a business in that neighborhood, you're a part of the community. You're a part of the history of everything that happens around there,\" he said. \"I'm old enough where I got to watch him. I saw what he meant to that area. I've met a lot of people of notoriety, and you do your best to tell the true story about the heroes of an area, or the leaders of a community. \n\"As silly as it might sound, he's an icon. He's a leader of this 10-block radius. It's a moment where you feel a responsibility to the community to at least provide the truth that you saw. …In my professional opinion, he didn't look drunk, and he didn't drink there. That's basically how we all feel about that as a business.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:58:23.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
