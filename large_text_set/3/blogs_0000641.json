One of the leading suggestions has been some sort of crossover film between two of the most popular characters of the X-Men world - Wolverine and Deadpool . \nWith that idea entering the pop culture consciousness, an iconic writer of Wolverine comics has weighed in on the topic. \nChris Claremont , best known for his 1982 Wolverine series with Frank Miller and his fifteen-year run with the Uncanny X-Men series, was asked by The Hollywood Reporter about the possibility of seeing a team-up between the two characters on the big screen. \n\"I think it would offer up a whole lot more interesting twists and turns than with Deadpool and Colossus.\" Claremont said, referencing the dynamic between the two characters in last year's Deadpool . \"I think the biggest challenge would be to discover who would be on top, because Deadpool is such a distinctive characterization and visual presentation, especially with everything that Ryan Reynolds brings to the equation.\" \nAccording to Claremont, the dynamic between the two larger-than-life characters would definitely find its footing, one with roots in the unique nature of the James Bond franchise. \"And yet, if you’re going to put Logan up against him with Hugh Jackman in the role, it would sort of be like a Sean Connery-in-his-prime, Daniel Craig team up. Who do you really want to root for? Who’s going to be boss?\" \n\"On the other hand,\" Claremont explains. \"It would be fun if you use that whole circumstance to perhaps tie up some characterization leftovers from Logan . There might be some leftover relationship problems, it could be fun.\" \nBut ultimately, Claremont believes the fun of that potential team-up would be seeing the dynamic between the two - and which villain would be worthy of facing the pair. \"Again, the challenge would be how you get them to play nice with each other and who their adversary would be.\" \nIn the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces. \nLogan stars Hugh Jackman (Logan), Boyd Holbrook (Donald Pierce), Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier), Dafne Keen (Laura Kinney/X-23), Doris Morgado (Maria), Stephen Merchant (Caliban), Elizabeth Rodriguez (Gabriela), and Richard E. Grant (Dr. Zander Rice). James Mangold is directing and helped on the screenplay along with Scott Frank and Michael Green. (Photo: 20th Century Fox) \nLogan hits theaters on March 3, 2017.
