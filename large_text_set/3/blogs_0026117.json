The patent suggests the iPhone could potentially handle the processing part as well as touch input and wireless communications. \nThe patent also includes a design where the screen is replaced with an iPad, similar to designs like the Incipio ClamCase Bluetooth keyboard , but with the addition of a touchpad below the keyboard. Apple's current iPad Pro models can be used with an optional keyboard, though they currently lack a touchpad, too. \nWith tablet sales continuing to shrink , this could extend the usefulness of an entry-level iPad like the one announced earlier this week , particularly for the education market. Apple faces stiff competition in that space, particularly from new Google Chromebooks that feature touchscreens and access to the Google Play app store.
