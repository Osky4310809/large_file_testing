Schaefer works for the Inquirer. More by Mari A. Schaefer Arrow icon \nA five-year-old Bucks County boy who was choked when the family dog pulled his scarf while playing in the snow last week has died. \nJohn Bruno, of Warrington, died Saturday at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where he had been transferred after the incident at his home in the Palomino Farms development. \nHis death from ligature strangulation was listed as accidental, said James Garrow, spokesman for the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, the boy's mother who was at home but inside, looked out a window and saw her son face-down in the snow with the family's 1½-year-old hound mix pulling at his scarf. She carried the boy, who was unconscious and unresponsive, inside to wait for medical help. He was taken to Doylestown Hospital and later transferred, Warrington Police said at the time. \nA GoFundMe page that was set up to defer the family' s medical and funeral expense has more than tripled the goal of $5,000. \nBruno, loved \"Ninja Turtles, Pokemon, Superheroes and being silly,\" the site stated. \n\"His smile and boundless energy was electric. He loved Ninja Turtles, Pokemon, Superheroes and being silly. Above all else John loved his mom, dad, and big sister,\" the GoFundMe site stated. \nMarch 20, 2017 — 1:15 PM EDT | Updated: March 20, 2017 — 2:43 PM EDT Do you have a minute?... \nOver the past year, the Inquirer, the Daily News and Philly.com have uncovered corruption in local and state public offices, shed light on hidden and dangerous environmental risks, and deeply examined the region’s growing heroin epidemic.
