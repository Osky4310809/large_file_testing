Nelson also mentioned that he had military ID, and CNN later reported that Santiago is actually in the Army. Santiago, 26, was born in New Jersey, and recently lived in Alaska. Witnesses told CNN that he got into an argument on a flight, though it’s unclear if this directly led to the shooting itself. In any case, the shooting started after Santiago allegedly took firearms from his luggage , prepared in an airport restroom, and came out shooting.\nThere remains no confirmed link between ISIS and the perpetrator.\nUpdate – January 6, 5:47 p.m.: We’ve added more information above regarding the actual shooting.\n[image via CBS]\nHave a tip we should know? tips@lawnewz.com", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/817494962531160065", "http://lawnewz.com/crazy/breaking-florida-mass-shooter-previously-told-fbi-he-fought-for-isis-report-says/", "https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/817490792554135555", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "https://t.co/e5UP9NEoqX", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://t.co/P6DXgTIdbY", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Flawnewz.com%2Fcrazy%2Fbreaking-florida-mass-shooter-previously-told-fbi-he-fought-for-isis-report-says%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "http://www.reddit.com/static/button/button3.js", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flawnewz.com%2Fcrazy%2Fbreaking-florida-mass-shooter-previously-told-fbi-he-fought-for-isis-report-says%2F&media=http://lawnewz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Esteban-Santiago-via-CBS-News-432x243.jpg&description=Florida%20Airport%20Shooter%20Previously%20Told%20FBI%20He%20Fought%20For%20ISIS%2C%20Report%20Says"], "published": "2017-01-07T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:07:06.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
