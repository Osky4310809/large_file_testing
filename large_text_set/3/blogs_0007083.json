Which group is more heavily discriminated against? \nThis isn’t a matter of opinion. The correct answer, based on any metric you want to use , is Muslims. And most religious groups are willing to say that. But not white evangelicals. 57% of them felt they have it harder in society while only 44% said that about Muslims. \nRight. Maybe one day, we’ll finally have a Christian President… \nThat same trend, of various religious groups heading in one direction while evangelicals go in the other, occurred when it came to business owners discriminating against their LGBT customers. Was that ever acceptable? \nMost religious groups said absolutely not — by a 2-1 margin at the very least! But evangelical Christians didn’t just close the margin. They flipped the results. \nWhite evangelical Protestants (56%) stand out as the only major religious group that favors allowing small business owners to refuse goods or services to gay and lesbian people on religious grounds. Fewer than one-third of white mainline Protestants (32%), Catholics (28%), black Protestants (24%), religiously unaffiliated Americans (21%), and members of non-Christian traditions (18%) support a religious exemption for small business owners. Notably, despite opposition to same-sex marriage, more than seven in ten (73%) black Protestants oppose allowing small business owners to refuse service to gay and lesbian people. \nIt’s okay to discriminate… as long as you’re not the people being discriminated against, I guess. So much for empathy. \nFinally, while we’re talking about discrimination, PRRI also asked Democrats and Republicans which groups they felt faced a lot of bigotry. \nLook at the stark contrast between the two parties. \nDemocrats are roughly twice as likely as Republicans to say gay and lesbian people face a lot of discrimination in the country today (79% vs. 40%, respectively). Notably, a majority (57%) of Republicans do not believe gay and lesbian people face a lot of discrimination. \nTo be clear, Republicans think Christians have it as bad, if not worse, as black people, LGBT people, immigrants, and Muslims. \nThat’s delusional for you. But what else would you expect from the party that wants to “save” health care by making sure millions of people won’t have insurance?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T17:43:45.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
