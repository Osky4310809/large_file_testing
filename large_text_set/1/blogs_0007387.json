We‚Äôre in Delhi, and it‚Äôs freezing at night. Most of our time is spent in handpicking the cosiest separates that we own so we can layer up against the cold. Safe to say that it‚Äôs time we brought them big coats out. Which brings us to most critical question of them all ‚Äì how do we style them? Well, we rummaged through the best coat moments courtesy our Bollywood ladies to inspire your winter style. Here are 6 times our celeb girl crushes nailed their outerwear game. \n1.Rani Mukherjee lets the collarless coat be the hero of her outfit, keeping her separates to all-black. The Tumblr-pink Dior tote looks like it has walked right out of our Pinterest boards. Sport this look while jetsetting to your next vacation.

If you are allergic to the bright colour, trade it for a neutral hue. Work your calf-grazing separates with matching pants and a full-sleeved top to a very-important work meeting. @priyankachopra Outfit - @31philliplim Shoes - @louboutinworld Styled by - @stylebyami @shnoy09 #bollywood #style #fashion #beauty #bollywoodstyle #bollywoodfashion #indianfashion #celebstyle #priyankachopra #31philliplim A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Dec 21, 2016 at 10:02pm PST \n4.Trust Sonam Kapoor to transition a formal blazer into a cool-girl outing.
