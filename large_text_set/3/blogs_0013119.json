Inna and Elena Vansovich were among the athletes caught up in the turmoil surrounding the Soviet collapse. Trained as professional speed skaters when the twins graduated from their sports academy in 1990, they found money for sport had all but run out.

A year later Ukraine declared independence and, with the encouragement of an academy coach, the sisters joined the newly-fledged country's national team (although it sometimes still competed as part of a \"Unified Team\" with players from other post-Soviet countries). Despite initial skepticism about women playing the sport, both quickly fell in love with it once they were on the ice. \"It was an incredible experience,\" says Elena Vansovich, now 43. On a table, she unfolds a yellowed newspaper clipping from a review of a friendly match played against a small Canadian team in 1995. \"They said our kit was rag-tag but our performance was good,\" she laughs. It was one of their last matches. Shortly after, on the way back from competing in a European Cup match, the twins were told for the second time in just a few years that there was no money left for their sport. \"The situation during the '90s in Ukraine was very turbulent, the financial situation was very bad,\" Elena says. \"So that's just how it was -- no more money, no more speed skating, then no more hockey.\" 'I woke up with goosebumps' For a long time, it seemed the dream of women's hockey was over before it began for the twins. That is, until a Kharkiv Panthers player asked them to join the club after finding a photo of them posing with their national team jerseys on Facebook. \"My first reaction was, 'No way!' I wasn't even sure I remembered how to play after all these years,\" Inna Vansovich says with a laugh. But once the idea was in her mind, she found herself dreaming of ice hockey when she fell asleep. \"I woke up with goosebumps ... I realized that I tried to forget about hockey but it was impossible, so in the end I said yes, I would like to go back.\" Much had changed in the two decades since the twins last played, but at least one thing has remained the same -- finances are still tight. The approximate $50,000 in funding the women's league receives from Ukraine's National Hockey Federation covers only the bare basics: three ice sessions per week per team, and the costs of holding games, including accommodation and food. Dnipro Queens and Kyiv Ukrainochka players wrestle for possession during the final. Extra practice time, kit and other expenses must either be funded by private sponsors or paid out of the players' own pockets. That's no small ask in a country where the average wage is around $200 per month , but hockey kit costs can easily run up to $1,000. The Ice Arena in Kiev, where this season's finals were held, is testimony to the over-stretched budget the league is working with: The floors creak worryingly under the feet around the ice rink, the changing areas are little more than rooms with a few wooden benches, and each team shares just one shower.

The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and the ongoing war in the east have dealt heavy blows to Ukraine's economy. Although there have been some tentative signs of recovery in recent months, finding sponsors in such \"difficult and uncertain times\" is not easy, Artemieva says. Despite the odds being stacked against them, the sport is slowly garnering attention in Ukraine, and beyond. This season's finals attracted hundreds of fans, many of whom had traveled hours across the country to be there -- a more than decent showing in a country where ice hockey is still very much seen as a \"man's sport,\" says Georgii Zubko, vice president of the Ukrainian Ice Hockey Federation and an ardent supporter of the women's league.

Hundreds of supporters tuned in to live streams of matches throughout the season, from a host of countries including: Canada, Russia -- ice hockey is akin to a religion in those nations -- Belarus and Britain. \"Next year there will be thousands (of fans),\" Zubko says. \"I can tell you, these ladies, never do anything once -- especially if it's already been successful.\" The league is only just concluded, but there is already talk of forming teams in Odessa and Kryvyi Rih to join next season, and organizers also hope to put together an official national team following a trial run of the best players at February's Global Girls' Games. If they are successful, it will be the first time Ukrainian women have competed at international level in ice hockey since the Vansovich twins represented their country more than two decades ago. \"It's my hope that my daughter will watch me play and want to play too,\" Elena Vansovich says, having posed on the ice for a photo with her children and bronze medal after the Panthers finished third. \"That for her there will be the possibility to play hockey.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:36:26.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
