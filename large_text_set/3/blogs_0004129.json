The move was supposedly confirmed in leaked Google documentation, but it’s unclear whether the company is dead set on it at this point.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com The iPhone 7 series has taught us that life without a headphone jack isn’t really all that difficult. Wireless headphones continue to become more affordable and more reliable, and adapters for those who prefer to use their old cans are pretty inexpensive. With that said, it makes sense to remove a rather large port to make room for more useful technology.\nAnd that’s exactly what Google could do for the Pixel 2, which will arrive later this year .\n“While we can’t share the nature of the documentation without putting the source at risk, we can say that the language used presents the removal of the jack as a matter of fact,” reports 9to5Google, which claims to have seen the Google documentation in question. The site notes, however, that “this information is coming from only a single source and we haven’t been able to obtain secondary confirmation as of yet.”\nMake of that what you will, then. 9to5 rates these claims with a “confidence score” of 6 out of 10, and mentions that another source who has provided Pixel 2 information in the past did not report the removal of the headphone jack — though did say Google is currently experimenting with several different variations of the device.\nOne of those variations is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835X chipset, while others are powered by Intel chips. As for water-resistance, that’s “still on the table” for now, with Google’s focus said to be again on a stellar rear-facing camera that will make the Pixel 2 one of the best smartphone shooters on the market — just like its predecessor .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T14:20:26.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
