There is also a chance for a tornado, but that may stay closer to the Red River, Stalley said. \nA tornado watch was issued through 11 p.m. for parts of North Texas, including Dallas, Tarrant, Collin and Denton counties. A Tornado Watch is in effect for parts of North Texas through 11 PM tonight. #dfwwx #ctxwx #texomawx pic.twitter.com/k7Dwc5YJtZ â€” NWS Fort Worth (@NWSFortWorth) March 26, 2017 \nIf a storm stalls over one location, that area could get half an inch to an inch of rain. The storms are expected to move out of North Texas by midnight. \nStalley encouraged people to keep checking weather alerts to make sure they're not caught up in a storm. Looking ahead \nAs Dallas-Fort Worth enters a more active weather pattern, there are more chances for strong storms every few days, Stalley said. \nThe next chance for storms could come late Tuesday or Wednesday, and possibly again next weekend. \n\"Spring has really arrived for North Texas,\" Stalley said. \nClouds are expected to start to form Tuesday and could bring a storm later in the day. There is a 60 percent to 100 percent chance of thunderstorms Wednesday. \nThe weather Thursday could be partly cloudy, breezy and cooler, with a high around 74. Friday is expected to be mostly sunny and mild. \nHere's what meteorologists at KXAS-TV (NBC5) have in the forecast for the week: \nMonday: 80/60", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:22:33.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
