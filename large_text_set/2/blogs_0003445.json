It was also the first overtime game in the 51-year history of the game. Obviously, people had things to say about this on the Internet.\nAthletes reacting to amazing athletic achievements is always a fun part of a big game, and sports Twitter did not disappoint.\nHere’s the current NBA champion LeBron James congratulating Tom Brady on the greatest comeback in NFL postseason history. \nBrady=GOAT. CONGRATS brother!!\n— LeBron James (@KingJames) February 6, 2017 \n\nSome NFL entities just couldn’t believe the Falcons blew that big a lead in the biggest game of the year. \nUnbelievable.\n— Carson Wentz (@cj_wentz) February 6, 2017 \n#SB51 \n— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) February 6, 2017 \n\nEven Usain Bolt was blown away by Tom Brady and the Patriots. \nWow #12\n— Usain St. Leo Bolt (@usainbolt) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nBrady’s fifth Super Bowl title was worthy of some artwork, which would have had to wait at least another year if the Falcons could have hung on.\nFive. #SB51 pic.twitter.com/iC1gOBkt48 \n— NFL (@NFL) February 6, 2017 \n\nPersonally, I liked the Salt Bae’s presence at the Super Bowl much more. \npic.twitter.com/AgYERHX1rN \n— bruce eien (@bruceeien) February 6, 2017 \n\nLots of people had sympathy for the Super Bowl-less people of Atlanta, but that didn’t stop a few people from ‘shopping a bit of schadenfreude. \nwow pic.twitter.com/IPKm3xVptL \n— trey (@treyzingis) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nInternet denizens even got to have a bit of fun with Kevin Durant absconding to the Golden State Warriors. \nView post on imgur.com \nIt was also a nice opportunity to make fun of the Warriors blowing a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals. Does anyone even remember that anymore? \nThe Patriots scored 31 straight points … \n3-1 straight points … pic.twitter.com/fyjXRrcGUq \n— SB Nation (@SBNation) February 6, 2017 \n\nPeople couldn’t help but compare this to November’s presidential election, which saw a big lead evaporate in the campaign’s dying days. \nBUT THE FALCONS WON THE POPULAR VOTE SO…….\n— Dave Barnes (@davebarnesmusic) February 6, 2017 \nFriend just texted me this. pic.twitter.com/lOL8JmkIS3 \n— Ellen L. Carmichael (@ellencarmichael) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nA few sites even jumped the gun a bit on crowning the Atlanta Falcons—and NFL MVP Matt Ryan—as champions. \nLollll this was all queued up to go at the mmqb dot com. pic.twitter.com/JFI5o8llrx \n— Robert Klemko (@RobertKlemko) February 6, 2017 \n\nWhoops.
