Conservatives intent on defunding it have been willing to bring the government to a brink of a government shutdown under a Democratic president. Some Republicans worry that the same group would be willing to do the same under a Republican president, something Cole called \"stupid.\" \nOn tax reform, one component that signifies how difficult it could be to pass is the border adjustability tax, which is a tax on any good or product brought into the U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan says it will incentivize companies to manufacture products in the U.S. to avoid the tax, but President Donald Trump has given mixed messages on his support. And many Republicans in the Senate have been strongly opposed, saying it would start a trade war. \nRep. Mike Coffman, who represents a swing district in Colorado, blamed the House Freedom Caucus as well for the failure of health care, but said that tax reform would be ideologically easier, except the health care flap has made it more difficult. \n\"I think tax reform is easier to do but not having this done makes it harder to do,\" Coffman said. \"It's a momentum issue. The fact is you came out of the fact and you stumbled. I think it slows the momentum and makes it harder.\" \nRep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, who just rescinded his membership to the conservative House Freedom Caucus over the weekend because of their dogmatic approach to legislating, said tax reform is going to be difficult. \n\"I think that is going to be more difficult to change the tax structure of the country than replacing and repealing Obamacare,\" Poe said on CNN, adding that the conservatives are going to be inclined to vote against Republican priorities. \nRep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y. and one of President Donald Trump's closest allies in Congress, insists that tax reform will be far easier than health care. \n\"The issues surrounding tax reform are easier,\" Collins said. \"They are not as emotionally charged as the health care debate.\" \nBut Collins also admitted that tax reform might not be as comprehensive anticipated. \n\"We'll get tax reform. Maybe not as quite as grand as we've hoped for,\" he said. Play", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:48:11.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
