Jaja and Dindin last played as teammates in the Philippine Superliga Grand Prix as part of the champions Foton but they spent most of their club careers staring at each other with a net between them. “Of course I’ll be happy if we’re both included in the lineup. She spent quite some time resting due to her pregnancy and it will be a big opportunity for the both of us if we’re in the national team,” said Jaja in Filipino Sunday at Arellano Gym. ADVERTISEMENT Dindin spent almost a year in the sidelines due to her pregnancy and wasn’t able to join Jaja in both the AVC Asian Women’s Club Championships and the FIVB Women’s Club World Championships. The sisters’ time as teammates in the collegiate scene were minimal with Dindin only playing for National University as a guest player in the Shakey’s V-League. Jaja added it would be a big boost to have Dindin as her teammate in the national team as her older sister has always guided her on and off the court. “For instance I have an off day, she’s there to boost my morale and help me improve,” said Jaja.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:15:01.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
