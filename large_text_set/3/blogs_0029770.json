He is an engaged citizen, and someone who deeply cares for the welfare of our country and its people. He has been in the news time and again for his charitable work, which includes the copious amounts of money he has donated to the jawaans of the nation, and also his friends in need. His work, too, is a reflection of important issues, and his upcoming film Toilet Ek Prem Katha addresses the lack of sanitation and places to defecate, that many people in our country face every day. Many actors turned the role down, but Akshay is not one to let go of an opportunity to educate people. A post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on Feb 20, 2017 at 9:12pm PST A post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on Nov 5, 2016 at 10:54pm PDT Time and again, Akshay has engaged with his audience, urging them to step up, take responsibility for their actions, and help those in need, whether it is our country's jawaans and their families, or victims of sexual harassment. This time, too, instead of posting promotional videos of Toilet Ek Prem Katha , he has posted a video talking about the abysmal state of sanitation, and how we need to build toilets for those who need it, instead of relying on the government. Isn't this what being a responsible citizen means, after all?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:29:24.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
