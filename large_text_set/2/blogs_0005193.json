Something as seemingly unimportant as a screw can often be overlooked while trying to procure all the necessary gear you'll need on set, but Jay P. Morgan of the Slanted Lens is here to show you one way to give this hardware its own place so they're well-organized, well-stocked, and ready when it comes time to shoot. \nThis isn't a new idea by any means—plenty of you probably have a box full of screws and other odds and ends that come in handy on set. However, for those who may have never had to deal with a missing or broken screw, this video may be your wake-up call. \nMorgan stocks his box with 1/4″-20 screws (because that's the type of screw used on almost everything, like tripods, mounts, etc.) of pretty much every length, handle, and end you can think of. He even keeps a couple of 1/4\"-20 furniture glides on hand, because the end serves as a great handle. He also keeps another box on hand with varying supplies, including a tap and die set, which allows him to create 1/4\"-20 screw threads whenever he needs to. \nIf you're a one-man-band or working on a small production, maybe you don't need an entire box dedicated to screws—but you never know! It's always better to be prepared.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:06:34.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
