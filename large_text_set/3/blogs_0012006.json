Trump had previously asked Bharara to stay on in his role asking him \"whether or not I’d [Bharara] be prepared to stay on as the United States attorney to do the work as we have done it, independently, without fear or favor for the last seven years,\" Bharara said. \nOn Friday, President Trump instructed a majority of U.S. attorneys to resign, to which Bharara declined. He was subsequently fired. I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired. Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life. \n— Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) March 11, 2017 \nWith Bharara gone, speculation is that the role will go to Marc Mukasey, whose father served as the attorney general under George W. Bush. The New York Times reported that Mukasey has previously represented former Fox CEO Ailes, and is now a front-runner to take the southern district of New York attorney that is investigation Fox news. \nThe posting of the southern district of New York presides over some of the biggest criminal and business cases. Bharara had been overseeing the probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's fundraising, where he allegedly funneled donations through an upstate New York county to help elect state candidates. \nManhattan attorney Judd Burstein who is representing former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros said he was perplexed at the timing and firing of Bharara. \"The firing of Preet, who did an extraordinarily evenhanded job is not remarkable, it’s just more the way it happened after he was told that he would stay on,\" Burstein told the NY Times . \n\"The timing with respect to the Ailes stuff is troubling. Stopping this investigation would destroy the credibility of the U.S. attorney’s office, which has always been the crown jewel of federal prosecutors’ offices.\" \nThere is no timeline on the naming of Bharara's replacement, a position he held since 2009. \n\"Serving my country as U.S. Attorney here for the past seven years will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life, no matter what else I do or how long I live,\" Bharara said in a press statement following his dismissal.
