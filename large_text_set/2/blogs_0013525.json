Late-night hosts were not impressed by his chilly claim that \"the powers of our president to protect our country... will not be questioned,\" and compared him to some unflattering people, places and cartoon characters. For example... \n\"Sméagol in a suit\" - Trevor Noah \nTwo-thirds of Montgomery Burns - Seth Meyers \n(Exact quote: \"That guy is 31 years old and he already looks like he's two-thirds of the way to Montgomery Burns.\") \n\"Young Gargamel\" (you know, from \"The Smurfs\") - Stephen Colbert \n\nSuperman villain General Zod - Stephen Colbert \n(Context: After making the Gargamel comment, Colbert played a video of the previously mentioned Stephen Miller quote. Then Colbert joked that Miller then added, \"I am become death, destroyer of worlds. Kneel before Zod.\" Which is a combo of famous quotes by Robert Oppenheimer and Zod.) \n\"The guy who shows up with a flashlight when teens are getting drunk in a graveyard.\" - Seth Meyers \nA foot - Trevor Noah \n(Exact quote: \"If you're wondering why his face looks familiar, it's probably because you see him every time you take off our socks. Black people, you can ignore that joke.\") \n\"A basic henchman\" - Trevor Noah \n\"A guilty husband who got caught texting with a female co-worker.\" - Seth Meyer \nWe'll keep updating this list as more Stephen Miller insults roll in.
