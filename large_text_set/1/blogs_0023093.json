The Reds crashed out of the FA Cup against Wolves (Photo: Alex Livesey) \n“But, at the same time, I’d like to see a bit more added to the squad – and, when that happens, we will see Liverpool get over the line. \n“Liverpool have lost some big players and some big leaders in recent years. \n“Jamie Carragher left, I left, Luis Suarez has left – and when you lose that, then it’s important that you keep adding to the squad. When you lose a player like Suarez, even signing four or five players won’t replace a talent like that. It’s tough.” Gerrard has highlighted the departure of Luis Suarez (Photo: Jamie McDonald/Getty) \nThe Premier League title was the only club honour Gerrard failed to win during a glorious 17-year career with his hometown club. \nHe said: “The hardest thing in a game is to get over the line. I found that on a couple of occasions in the Premier League. \n“When you get to a certain stage of a competition, you’re coming up against world-class teams, world-class managers and world-class players and you need that extra special bit of talent to see you through.
