Pep Guardiola rushed to Arsene Wenger's defence on Sunday. \n\"For me, our job at the moment, we don't have any respect for any position. What happened was unacceptable. We take decisions and you can say whatever you want.\" \nCity were held by Huddersfield and now face a replay at the Etihad on Feb. 28 with the winners playing Middlesbrough in the sixth round. \nWhile the fixture won't affect City plans for a short warm weather training break to Abu Dhabi following Tuesday's Champions League clash with Monaco, it's an extra game in what could be a very busy final few months of the season. \nGuardiola made eight changes for the clash with Huddersfield and defended his decision to not play a stronger lineup from the start. \n\"I take my decisions and you analyse them after, I have to take the decision before. The best solution was what I'd done,\" he said. \nJonathan is ESPN FC's Manchester City correspondent.
