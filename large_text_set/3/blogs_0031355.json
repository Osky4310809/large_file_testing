So he did, while he was in Indianapolis for Andrew’s Celebration of Life service. \nThree months later, in April 2016, Stigall got a call, telling him he could be a potential match and asking if he were willing to undergo further testing. He said yes, of course — and then immediately dialed up Samantha Smith, Andrew’s wife and the public face of Butler’s Project 44, its partnership with Be the Match. (No. 44 was Andrew’s jersey number.) \nFormer Butler player Chase Stigall, shown here in a 2012 game.

I could be a potential donor,” and she started crying. She said that she had had the worst day possible. She was trying to mow her yard for the first time by herself. She was crying, just having a bad day. Then, when I told her that — Andrew's looking out after us because he knew you were having a bad day so he gave you something to cheer you up about. \n“It was Andrew to her. It was all Andrew talking to her.” \nSamantha said she’s cried like that each time she’s gotten a call from someone saying they might be a match. Tears not rooted in sadness — even if she’d been missing Andrew right up until that moment — but tears of thankfulness and pride. \nButler guard Chase Stigall (33) and teammate Andrew Smith defend in the 2011 Final Four.

And he, like Samantha, has decided to make Be the Match a priority in his life — as a way to honor Andrew’s legacy — and he’s taking that project on the road this week. \nStigall is in Phoenix, scheduled to meet with the senior players Wednesday who will be participating in the State Farm Slam Dunk & 3-Point Championships on Thursday night, part of the Final Four week festivities. He wants to share Andrew’s story and also his personal story of marrow donation, and hopefully get student-athletes to join the registry. Be the Match has even launched a campaign called “ Be the Guy ,” aimed at young men between the ages of 18-24, who could be prime candidates for donation. \n“My goal is to get every Division I athlete to sign up,” Stigall said. “Now, that's going to take a lot of work and the Final Four is not just going to do that. But, if I can touch 40 seniors that are going to be at the College Slam Dunk and 3-Point Contest, and they can go back to their university and get their teams signed up … that's great, and that's something that gets the ball rolling. That’s what we want — to get the ball rolling.” \nStigall met with the seniors Wednesday, and he will be recognized on the court during the live event Thursday night. He has looked forward to being back in a Final Four environment — he and Andrew were part of the back-to-back Butler title-game appearances in 2010 and 2011 — and having the opportunity to help Andrew’s legacy endure. \n“Andrew was the most unselfish, most caring player and person,” said Stigall, who also mentioned that Andrew introduced him to his wife. “His legacy is going to be remembered forever because he was the guy that didn't have to do what he did. He could have fought his battle alone. He could have fought it alone, him and his wife, spending as much time as possible with her, but what he did was went out and educated people, tried to get people to sign up (for the registry). \n“We do not want Project 44 to dwindle away. We want it to keep going. A lot of times that's what happens with these things — somebody starts them, then as the years pass they dwindle. That's something that we don't want to happen, because Andrew's legacy is that important to us.” \nMORE FROM THE FINAL FOUR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:06:02.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
