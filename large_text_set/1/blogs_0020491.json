Sarah Tew/CNET \nYou'll no longer have to fumble around to find your missing AirPods. \nApple's latest iOS 10 beta update, 10.3, lets you locate your new Apple wireless headphones using the \"Find My iPhone\" feature, undoubtedly making a few of you feel very relieved. \nOther features in the new update -- available to beta users Tuesday and everyone else later -- include being able to ask Siri for cricket scores and stats for the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council . A sample question you can ask is \"Who took the most wickets last year in IPL?\" (We'll see if Siri can actually explain what cricket is to those of us who don't understand the game. For instance, what's a wicket?) \nThird party payment app developers will be able to integrate Siri to pay and check the status of bills, while ride booking apps will be able to call on Siri to schedule a ride. Apple's CarPlay feature for auto adds shortcuts to launch the last two used apps, while Maps now displays EV charging stations. 3D Touch on the weather icon in Maps brings you hourly forecasts, chance of rain and daily high and low temperatures. \nTapping on the iMessage app icon now displays iMessage apps, while HomeKit adds support for programmable switch accessories.

When that rumor popped up, it faced a lot of backlash from people who feared even more fellow theater-goers would text during films. \nApple updates its mobile device and Mac software on a regular basis, adding new features and bug fixes for users. In recent years, it's also let the general public download beta versions of its software, testing out new features before they're released to all Apple device users. Currently 76 percent of iOS users have iOS 10, the version of Apple's software introduced in September. By comparison, less than 1 percent of Android users have Google's newest version of the software. \nMacOs 10.12.4 developer beta 1 brings Night Shift to Macs, letting you change your display color to warmer tones at night. The featured first arrived on Apple devices a year ago on the iPhone with iOS 9.3 . \nShanghainese dictation support will let your Macs convert words spoken in the Asian language to text. You won't be able to use spoken commands to perform tasks in that language, though. \nSiri cricket stats will also come to the Mac, though they may not arrive with the first beta. 45 Apple AirPods are nowhere near as ridiculous as they look Share your voice", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T20:30:17.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
