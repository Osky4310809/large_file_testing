Eventually, he had to be taken off to a nearby hospital in an ambulance. \nIn the 43rd over of the innings, Tim Southee bowled a lifter that didn't rise off the pitch. Hence, Rahim turned his eyes off the ball as he looked to duck and copped a blow flush on the back of his helmet. The Bangladesh captain was rattled and fell down on the floor. \nThere was major concern among the New Zealand players and the crowd about the well-being of Rahim. Tamim Iqbal, Rahim's team-mate, jogged out to the middle to assess Rahim's condition. Hopefully, the veteran batsman was wearing a stem guard on the back of his helmet. \nFortunately, immediate medical attention was provided and he was taken off the field. In fact, medical staff from both teams offered Rahim first aid. Eventually, he had to stretchered off the field and the medical staff took him to a Wellington hospital. \nAfterwards Tamim told reports at the ground: \"Mushfiqur is fine. He has been taken to the hospital for precaution.\" \nFor long periods of the session, Rahim was troubled by short deliveries from the New Zealand pacer Neil Wagner. Rashim, who also has been troubled by a thumb problem, had a few issues in keeping out fuller length deliveries, with his bottom hand coming off the bat handle. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T02:27:14.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
