REXShutterstock \nAccording to the report, Kim was targeted by the gang because of all the jewelry pictures she posted to her social media accounts. \nHe went on to say Kim was also easy to keep track of because of her social media presence. Instagram \nHe reportedly told police, \nThe jewels were shown on the internet, and [she said] that she didn’t wear fakes… the time she would arrive in France, you just had to look at the internet and you knew everything, absolutely everything. \nWhat makes this case even weirder is Khedache apparently claimed the whole robbery was an inside job. He allegedly told police that someone “very close” to Kim gave the criminals “precise information” on where the Kardashians would be during their time in Paris. \n(I’ve been very vocal in the past about the person I think set this whole thing up, so I’m not surprised. *cough* KRIS! IT WAS KRIS! *cough*) REUTERS \nWithout getting t conspiracy theory-esque, this could explain how the robbers knew to attack Kim while the one security guard they had on staff was away with Kendall and Kourtney at a different club in the area. \nKim Kardashian was held at gunpoint during a heist that took place during Paris Fashion Week. \nAccording to reports, robbers broke into Kim’s hotel room before tying Kim up and gagging her. They then locked her in the bathroom and proceeded to steal between $6 million and $11 million in jewelry, including her wedding ring. \nAfter the assault, Kim took a break from all social media before returning back to the internet in January.
