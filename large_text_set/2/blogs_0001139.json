But was this information already out in the world and we just didn't know about it??\nRelated: Celebs React To Beyonc√©'s Baby News! \nFour days before Bey's reveal, @beyoncefan666 not only predicted the baby news, the Crazy In Love singer apparently told him/her PERSONALLY!\nBeyonc√© is pregnant. She told me.\n‚Äî . (@beyoncefan666) January 28, 2017 \n\nIn a weird twist, the account actually foresaw the announcement in July of LAST YEAR! \nOkay so Beyonc√© is gonna announce a pregnancy in February(2017)\n‚Äî . (@beyoncefan666) July 22, 2016 \n\n\"BeyonceFan666\" also correctly guessed what the musician was going to perform at the 2016 VMAs !\n*cough cough* vma medley\n‚Äî . (@beyoncefan666) August 21, 2016 \n\nBut things gets even crazier! The user correctly envisioned the release of Lady GaGa 's album Joanne , Donald Trump 's presidential win, and the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union aka Brexit!\nLady gaga album coming out in October\n‚Äî . (@beyoncefan666) August 4, 2016 \n\nUnfortunately Donald Trump will be elected president :(\n‚Äî . (@beyoncefan666) June 14, 2016 \n\nU.K. Voted to leave the Eu\n‚Äî .

(@beyoncefan666) July 24, 2016 \n\nhello from the futureüëãüèΩ just to let you know america is currently crashing and burning under trumps leadership\n‚Äî . (@beyoncefan666) July 24, 2016 \n\nBefore you drink the Kool-Aid, take all of this with a grain of salt. It's 100% possible that this person made all of these predictions under a private account, and made the tweets public when something big actually happened.\nEither way, shit is crayyyy!\n[ Image via Beyonc√©/ Instagram . ] \nTags: baby blabber , baby bump watch , beyonce , celeb kidz , donald trump , instagram , lady gaga , pregnancy talk , pregnant , tacky and true , twitter , vmas , wacky", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:55:42.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
