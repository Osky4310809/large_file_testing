But this new data indicates that, even if deals are possible, that’s not primarily what Democratic voters are looking for,” said Morning Consult chief research officer and co-founder Kyle Dropp. \nThe same poll also revealed that 58 percent of respondents wanted their elected representatives to consider Trump’s appointee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, based on his qualifications — not on ideology. \nAdditionally, 54 percent of respondents supported Trump’s travel ban , and only 38 percent of registered voters reported they opposed the executive order that severely limits travel from seven muslim-majority nations. \nThe poll included 2,070 registered voters, and ran from Feb. 3 through Feb. 5. The poll carried a margin of error of 2 percentage points in either direction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:37:16.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
