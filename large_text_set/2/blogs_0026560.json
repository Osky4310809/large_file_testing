The Constitution, though, does not specify how long a session must be, so a one-day session is enough to fulfil this criterion. \nThis six-month period ends on March 3, prompting the Governor to convene the House. Leader of Opposition and Congress MLA Pratapsing Rane has said that this has happened for the first time in the country’s history after polling. \nIf six months passes between two Assembly sessions, it is then assumed that the state Assembly has lapsed. \nEarlier this month, Goa Congress president Luizinho Faleiro submitted a representation to the Governor asking her to avert a constitutional crisis and convene an Assembly session before March 3. \nThe Election Commission’s model code of conduct, meanwhile, does not have any explicit rules about convening Assembly sessions. The code of conduct does specify what the ruling party can do as far as electioneering work, usage of government transport, finances, and the usage of public office to make announcements on financial grants or schemes. \nWhile Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar had earlier ruled out the need for such a session, the decision to convene a session clearly arises out of a need to not let the Assembly lapse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:51:08.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
