Medina—who played Red Ranger Cole Evans on multiple versions of the monster-battling kids show—admitted to “an allegation of using a sword in the killing” of his roommate Josh Sutter in 2015. \nMedina—who had nothing to do with the production of the Power Rangers movie currently in theaters—was arrested in connection with Sutter’s death last January . His plea deal means he could be eligible for parole in three years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:36:51.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
