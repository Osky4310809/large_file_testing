He is ready,\" Guardiola said in his media conference. \nGuardiola will also welcome midfielder Fernandinho back into the squad, the Brazilian having served a four-match ban for his red card against Burnley - his third dismissal in the space of six matches. \n\"He's so important, we play a lot of games without him. I am happy he's back. He's important for us,\" Guardiola said. \n\"The idea is the same with him in the side. He's not aggressive. He's a tough intense player like English football is. He is one of the nicest guys I've met. \nZabaleta: I miss the Manchester rain \n\"What happened against Chelsea we have talked a lot about. \n\"What happened after happens many, many times.

Good players,\" he said. \n\"The window is important for the club, players. Every weekend I am so sad because I have to leave three players at home. \n\"While this happens why should we buy. If players leave, maybe. I'm happy.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:23:22.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
