The day has finally arrived: MAC Cosmetics has announced that it will soon be available in Ulta stores. \nThere are a lot of reasons to be excited here. Convenience is one of them. Sheer love of good makeup being spread in the world is another. Plus, any time superpowers come together to combine their awesomeness, it just feels right. Kind of like the Power Rangers , only instead of fighting Rita Repulsa, the brands are fighting for more ways for all of us to get our hands on high-quality MAC makeup. Everybody wins. \nThe MAC folks tell us that the brand will first pop up on the beauty emporium's site in May, and then it'll start heading to brick and mortar stores in June. By the end of the year, the makeup-artist-favorite line will be in 100 stores. 100 stores, people. If this isn't an exciting day for makeup lovers everywhere, we don't know what is. (Although, it's probably not great for our budgets.) \nSo why no sign of the brand in Sephora (at least yet)? According to a story on WWD.com , it all comes down to location. MAC stores and the department stores that carry the brand tend to be in mallsâ€”where Sephora also often lives. But Ulta, on the other hand, is often located in strip malls as its own standalone location, so this move gives MAC a whole new stream of traffic. \nMAC celebrated with a cute announcement on Instagram calling it the \"Best. News. Ever.\" It just might be. To give you a sense of what you're in for, below is a rendering of what the shelves will look like.
