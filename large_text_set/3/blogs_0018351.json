(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) At his Senate confirmation hearings today, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch declined to answer questions about the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits a public officeholder from accepting payments from a foreign government or foreign government-owned entity without Congressional approval.\nThe questions, from Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat, highlighted how extraordinarily fraught Gorsuch’s nomination is, as his hearings unfold amid the unprecedented presidential conflicts of interest precipitated by Trump’s refusal to divest from his vast business empire. And these unparalleled circumstances make Gorsuch’s answers — or, more accurately, his evasions — a matter of grave consequence for public confidence in the Court’s ability to hold Trump accountable, should it hear any political corruption cases against Trump.\nThe possibility of a Supreme Court case against Trump is more than speculative. Days after Trump took office, the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, along with some of the nation’s leading ethics and constitutional lawyers, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Trump “has violated the Constitution during the opening moments of his presidency and is poised to do so continually thereafter for the duration of his administration.” The improper benefits to Trump, CREW charges, include leases by foreign entities in Trump-owned buildings, reservations at his hotels, and payments from rebroadcasts of The Apprentice, among other things.\nApparently using the pendency of this litigation as an excuse, Gorsuch demurred from Leahy’s questions on the grounds that if confirmed, he would likely hear such a case. Throughout his hearings, Gorsuch has leaned on this crutch — that Supreme Court nominees should not comment on the merits of pending cases, or cases that are likely to come before the Court. He has used this pretext to avoid saying whether he agrees with the holding in, for example, in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case legalizing abortion.\nBut the evasion on the Emoluments Clause is different. For one thing, there is no Supreme Court precedent on the Emoluments Clause, a further sign that Trump’s alleged violation of it would be unprecedented, both legally and politically. Rather than addressing the gravity of these political corruption charges and the threat Trump’s alleged wrongdoing poses to the Constitution and our democracy, Gorsuch described the Emoluments Clause more as a quaint relic that “sat in a rather dusty corner” for most of the nation’s history.\n“Among other things, it prohibits members of the government of this country from taking emoluments — gifts from foreign agents,” he went on. “The question is what exactly that means.”\nThat is the question, but Gorsuch’s answer fails to inspire any confidence that he takes the provision seriously as a check against alleged corruption of the president who tapped him for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.\nThroughout the hearings yesterday and today, Gorsuch has only mildly distanced himself from Trump. When asked, for example, about Trump’s denigration of federal judges presiding over cases against his business empire (Trump University) and his executive actions (his Muslim ban), Gorsuch would only say , “When anyone criticizes the honesty or the integrity or the motives of a federal judge, I find that disheartening. I find that demoralizing — because I know the truth.”\nThe crucial inquiry, though, is not whether Gorsuch, as a judge, feels demoralized or disheartened by criticism. The separation of powers is not about his feelings. The question is whether he is reluctant to stand apart from the president over Trump’s efforts to delegitimize the judiciary — a tactic used in authoritarian kleptocracies, not democracies.\nGorsuch has strained to present himself as an apolitical animal, and the entire judicial process as one divorced from politics. We know that’s not true. But if Gorsuch really believes it, that’s exactly why he needs to signal he isn’t beholden to Trump. The president, after all, will have given him him tenure for life on the court that very well could decide whether the president has violated the Constitution by seeking profits over the best interests of the country.", "external_links": ["http://s3.amazonaws.com/storage.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/23222937/Complaint-17-458.pdf", "http://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/supreme-court-nominee-neil-gorsuch-hearing-senate-judiciary-committee?mg=id-wsj", "https://twitter.com/@sarahposner"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:34:14.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
