The favorite is probably Moonlight , which won the Writers Guild of America award for original screenplay but was slotted into adapted by the Oscars. (It’s based on a play, but mostly on the idea of that play, which has never been produced. That’s why it’s been easy to argue it for both original and adapted .) It also won the USC Scripter Award , and every winner of that prize since 2010 has won Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars. The steady challenger is Arrival , which wrestled a complicated short story onto the big screen, in all its scientific and emotional complexity. (Incidentally, Arrival won adapted screenplay at the WGA, where it didn’t have to compete against Moonlight .) And the spoiler is Hidden Figures , which has come on strong late in the game and needs to win some other prize if it’s going to threaten for Best Picture. (Okay, technically, it doesn’t need to win anything else, but the only Best Picture winner to win just Best Picture was Grand Hotel way back in 1932. So precedent is on the side of the Best Picture victor also winning something else.) Moonlight will win, but the race is closer than you think. Will win: Moonlight Could win: Arrival Dark horse: Hidden Figures Should win: As much as I love Moonlight , Arrival ’s script is dazzling, and works beautifully as both an emotional tone poem and a puzzle box mystery. Original Screenplay Manchester by the Sea has one of the best screenplays in recent memory. Amazon Studios Hell or High Water , Taylor Sheridan La La Land , Damien Chazelle The Lobster , Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthimis Filippou Manchester by the Sea , Kenneth Lonergan 20th Century Women , Mike Mills How dominant will La La Land actually turn outto be? If it’s merely a standard level of dominance, the movie will probably lose Original Screenplay on its way to winning seven or eight Oscars total. If it’s an all-time high level of dominance, the movie will win Original Screenplay, on its way to winning 11 or 12 Oscars. I’m predicting that La La Land will do well, but not that well, and Original Screenplay is one of the categories I think it will lose. Granted, I felt more strongly about this two months ago, before Manchester by the Sea seemed to disappear from the face of the earth and before its Oscar nomination total came in a little soft. But Lonergan’s script is just about perfect in how it balances storytelling and emotional revelations, and one of the few criticisms that has managed to stick to La La Land is that its script is a little soft. Still, this is no sure thing. If La La Land wins here, it’s almost certainly having a great night. Win: Manchester by the Sea Place: La La Land Show: Hell or High Water Should win: Manchester’ s script is one of the best in recent memory — which is why I’m voting for 20th Century Women here, because it deserved better. (Seriously, Mike Mills’s script for that movie is also a marvel. This category is an embarrassment of riches.)
