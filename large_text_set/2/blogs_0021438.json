Most meals are vegan and vegetarian-friendly, but you can opt for omnivore meals, too. The service will be available beginning next week, Tech Crunch reports. \nCo-founder Shiri Avnery says she got the idea for the new service after she became a mom. \"I would buy things at the grocery and feel like they were not up to my quality standards all the time,\" she told Tech Crunch. \"Even a lot of the healthier options are over-processed , pureed, with a watery consistency. They also don't taste like real fruits or veggies. And you're left wondering how long this has been on the shelf and in what kind of conditions.\" \nThistle's announcement coincides with a new study that shows babies who eat homemade food are leaner than babies who eat store-bought, ready-made options. Plus, perhaps unsurprisingly, those babies learn to like a wider variety of food types. \nAccording to the research, conducted by Research Institute at McGill University Health Centre and the Montreal Children's Hospital, babies who only ate homemade foods over the course of the study had lower body fat mass at 1 and 3 years old. \n\"The results could have implications for preventing obesity and chronic diseases associated with poor food choices,\" lead study author Dr. Elise Mok said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:33:47.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
