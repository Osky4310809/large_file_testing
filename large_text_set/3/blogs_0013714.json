A one-page worksheet about fractions.\nThis is the Homework Industrial Complex, our longstanding belief that no primary school education is complete unless pupils are brushing up their skills each night with take-home work.\nBut here’s the troubling secret about homework: Every time researchers try to identify a good reason for elementary schoolers to do homework, they can’t find one.\n“There has been no research that shows any academic benefit to homework in the elementary years … there is no correlation between homework in the elementary years and future success,” Stanford University education researcher Denise Pope said in a 2015 interview.\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n-FLSMz93E&w=640&h=390]\nIn 2005, Penn State researchers Gerald LeTendre and David Baker took an international look at how homework correlated with academic performance. Notably, the pair found that low-homework countries such as Japan and Denmark were utterly trouncing the performance of high-homework countries such as Thailand and Iran.\nThe most comprehensive study of homework effectiveness comes from 2006, when Duke University neuroscientist Harris Cooper reviewed more than 60 homework-related research studies.\nWhile Cooper is still pro-homework (he advocates 10 minutes a night for younger students), the study showed little evidence than an elementary schooler’s performance was improved by take-home work.\n“Kids burn out,” Cooper said in a statement .\nMeanwhile, the drawbacks of homework are well known: Loss of sleep, loss of leisure time and loss of family interactions.\nFile photo An unidentified child collapsing under the crushing yoke of homework. How many scarce hours with the grandparents have been lost because Little Susie had to spend the evening slogging through some abominable John Steinbeck novella?\nHomework also disproportionately favours the rich over the poor. Wealthy children have access to tutors, private computers and stay-at-home parents, while the disadvantaged are left to fend for themselves.\nIn 1992, an interviewer asked former prime minister Pierre Trudeau about the privileges that his large inheritance had given him.\nTellingly, Trudeau’s response was an anecdote about homework. As a student at Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, Trudeau had realized that while he had a private room to complete his assignments, poorer students “were doing their homework … on the kitchen table with mother cooking the food and the rest of the family milling about and so on.”\nWorst of all, the practice can teach young children to hate school. Even before we’ve started to mould them into Canada’s future ranks of engineers and tradespeople, thousands of young students are taught to associate math and reading with rote, mandatory assignments.\nThe equation changes in high school and the university level, of course. Society is pretty dependent on a world where lawyers and doctors are prepared to hit the books for a few hours each night.\nBut at the elementary level, science shows that homework remains what it has always been: Misguided, childhood-robbing busywork.\nTed Rhodes/Calgary Herald Eleven year old Calgary boy Mark Anderson pictured in the act of not visiting relatives, using his imagination or enjoying the great outdoors. Nevertheless, the practice stubbornly continues. While education ministries across Canada are reforming their policies to make homework more effective, none have apparently considered the possibility that homework-free schooling might be the best option of all.\n“Homework is an important part of every child’s school experience,” reads the official website of the Toronto District School Board.\nEven after a restructuring of provincial homework policy, Nova Scotia still credits the practice as a way to develop “life skills.”\nMeanwhile, the B.C. Ministry of Education advises against homework from kindergarten to grade three, but they still recommend 2.5 hours of homework per week starting in grade four.\nLast year, Texas teacher Brandy Young received international acclaim when she announced that her classroom was a homework-free zone.\n“Research has been unable to prove that homework improves student performance,” she wrote in a note to parents. “Rather, I ask that you spend your evenings doing things that are proven to correlate with student success. Eat dinner as a family, read together, play outside, and get your child to bed early.”\nAnd indeed, Canada has its own heroic Brandy Youngs.\nCollège St-Ambroise in Quebec banned homework in 2014. And, as expected, academic outcomes remain unaffected.\nIn Alberta, grade four teacher Eric Armitage saw the family strife that homework was causing — and vowed to teach a curriculum that evaded any need for take-home assignments.\nSpeaking to Postmedia last year , Armitage issued a call to his colleagues to dip their toe into the forbidden waters of a homework-free schooling.\n“If you try it and it doesn’t work, you have the power and control. You can go back,” he said.\nHopefully, they are the pioneers of a new order: A world where pre-pubescent children must never know the pain of an all-nighter or the sweaty panic of a book report forgotten on the printer tray.\n• Email: thopper@nationalpost.com | Twitter: TristinHopper \nSupplied Grade 4 teacher Eric Armitage rarely gives homework, because it's not always effective, and infringes on children's time for sports and other activities.  \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:47:46.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
