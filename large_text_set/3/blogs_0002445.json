In 2016, he earned $100,000 — $30,000 more than he made at his writing job.\n“People now think my decision to do it is the greatest thing ever,” said the 37-year-old, who lives in Boston. “At the beginning, though? They thought I was insane.”\nHe’s written a book, “ Dueling With Kings: High Stakes, Killer Sharks and the Get-Rich Promise of Daily Fantasy Sports ” (Touchstone), out Tuesday, about how he did it.\nLike many other baseball writers, Barbarisi discretely gambled on fantasy sports. But even with their expert knowledge of baseball, many failed miserably. Barbarisi himself lost more than $1,000 over the course of a few months.\n“It made me crazy,” he told The Post. “I tried keeping [the losses] from my wife. But I kept thinking I was just a little bit away from getting good.”\n\nThe fantasy-sports industry generated around $3 billion in tournament fees in 2015, and boasts some 57.4 million participants in the US and Canada. Players assemble hypothetical teams; points are accumulated based on how their chosen athletes fare during real-life games. The player whose roster accumulates the most points wins money at the end of the tournament, which can last a day or a season.\nIn the book, Barbarisi explores why the same small pool of people seem to continually win: A McKinsey & Co. study shows that 1 percent of fantasy players rake in 91 percent of prize money. Losing players tend to see the game as entertainment and revel in their limited successes. Consistent winners closely analyze statistics, sometimes use computer models and have no team or athlete loyalties.\nBarbarisi began the crossover from chump to champ after meeting fantasy pro Jay Raynor, who plays as BeepImaJeep and specializes in hockey, at a party for ­DraftKings, one of the top fantasy sites. Raynor took him under his wing.\nBarbarisi forsook baseball for hockey because “competition was soft.” Following Raynor’s lead, he focused on players who correlated well — when one scored, others on the roster were likely to get assists, thus creating complementary actions that increase the likelihood of piling on fantasy points. He perused Las Vegas betting lines to gauge scoring probabilities and scrutinized Web sites offering data on esoteric situations such as an athlete’s “behind the net shot assists per 60 minutes.”\nEven though he already had a book deal, Barbarisi’s Journal colleagues figured he was nuts for leaving his gig. At first, it looked like they might be right: He racked up $6,500 in losses between May 2015 and January 2016.\n“I feared that I had given up my job to be a loser gambler,” he recalled. At the time, he was betting between $500 and $1,000 per day, seven days a week. But his mentor, Raynor, disagreed.\n“He recognized that my lineups were strong,” Barbarisi said, “and that things would turn around.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:40:12.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
