We’re going back to Super Bowl,” a fan said. \n“Of course, Tom Brady, the best quarterback ever in history and I love him,” another fan said. \nAnother AFC championship was a nice dig at NFL commissioner Roger Goodell for that now passe football story. \n“Go Pats, go Pats, from Hungary, too.” \nIn this game, the Patriots were on fire. \n“Pittsburgh didn’t show up,” one female fan said. \nAnd, so were their fans. \n“Mama is excited,” another woman with her children told WBZ. \n“We are thankful for Pats Nations.” \n“Yes, yes, yes.” \n“We bleed blue. We are die hard fans, die hard, look,” a pair of female fans in Patriots gear exclaimed. \nWith victory in the air. \n“We won and we go forward.” \nPatriots Nation is already on to the Super Bowl. \n“One more, one more,” a Patriots fan wearing replica Super Bowl rings pleaded.
