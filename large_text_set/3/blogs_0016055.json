the ‘ sharing ’ space, a public area for collaboration, socialising and sharing; the ‘ creative ’ zone, a space for innovation, invention and imagination; and ‘ porous fabric ’ an intermediate area between public and private that offers opportunities for exchanges. \n\nfour international architectural practices, chosen on the basis of geographic area of provenance, have been invited to design an installation within cristiana cutrona’s display. each one not only embodies their own vision of the office of the future, but also the cultural characteristics of their areas of origin. \nportrait of primo orphilla, co-founder of studio O+A \n\n\nthe ‘water cooler’ by primo orpilla and verda alexander of studio O+A (USA) aims to feed the imagination, restore motivation and regenerate the people who work in it through its ability to adapt to their physical and emotional needs. the space can be marked out into different areas in accordance to the worker’s needs and activities. \nportrait of verda alexander, co-founder of studio O+A (more high-res image needed) \n\n\nfrom iran, arash ahmadi / ahmadi studio has conceived an adaptive and constantly evolving workspace , capable of bringing the personal and social spheres together in an effort to respond to people’s competing demands. it sources two traditional iranian spaces; the persian garden, an intimate and private place, and a bazaar, a place of exchange and discussion, which mirrors the dynamism and variety of contemporary work and society. these elements will be interlinked and will surround a fixed, vortex-like element that expands upwards throughout the space. \narash ahmadi of studio ahmadi created an office that references iran \n\n\n‘chronotopic system’ by alfonso femia and gianluca peluffo of studio 5+1AA (italy) , changes in relation to space and time, and according to the use, the demands and the desires of those who inhabit it. the conceptual space focuses on generating new relationships by challenging the ideas of encroachment, pollution, integration and belonging. \nalfonso femia is the founding partner of studio 5+1AA, alongside gianluca peluffo \n\n\nben van berkel of UNstudio and SCAPE ’s jeff povlo (the netherlands) reflects the condition of stress at work through an immersive and modular space called ‘RESET’ – responsive emotional transformation. it draws upon scientifically proven methods of reducing stress in a playful and interactive way. by using technology which is applied to people but perceived by the environment, the space adapts according to the level of strain experienced. \nben van berkel, founder and principal architect of UNstudio \n\njeff povlo is the managing director of SCAPE tim spears I designboom", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T13:55:17.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
