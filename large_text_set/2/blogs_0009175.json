I want this,\" He said at a news conference at Cobham Training Centre. \"For me it's a great support, my daughter and my wife. \n\"I think it's important for my daughter to see my will to win. And I try always to transfer the right education to my daughter. I think she's happy to live the game with me. I live the game in this way not only in England, but if you remember, during the Euros. \n\"If you remember in my past with Juventus, when I started my career, I lived the game with great passion and enthusiasm.

However, it's just that not everyone shows it in the same way. \nâ€œEveryone lives the situation in the right way. I think it's not good to badly judge someone for always sitting during the game. It's not good to badly judge if one manager follows the game and stands up for all the games. \n\"Everyone has a known style. But I think that I have great passion for football. The moment you see me staying seated, you should be worried. Above all my club must be worried, because I think my passion would be finished.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:13:51.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
