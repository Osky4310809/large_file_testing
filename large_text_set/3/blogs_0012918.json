All sequences were aligned with Sal-1 ( P. vivax ) reference sequences from Plasmodium data base Furthermore, mutations in pvdhfr gene were analysed and all mutations, F57L/I, S58R, T61M, and S117T/N, showed the highest mutant rate in Shwegyin (70/88, 79.5%) followed by Kawthaung (45/60, 75.0%). Wild type alleles were found only in Buthidaung (5/60, 8.3%). Triple or quadruple mutant alleles of pvdhps was observed and accounted for more than 50% of samples in all study sites (Table 4 ). A combined analysis of all mutations in 208 samples totaled 80 different genotypes (Additional file 1 ). Discussion This study explores the clinical and molecular pattern of candidate drug resistance markers in Myanmar. Retrospective and prospective analysis on TES of chloroquine on vivax malaria (2009–2016) showed that clinical failures were detected only in southern and western Myanmar. Molecular markers analysis augments additional information on the pattern of drug resistance. In this study, molecular maker analysis indicated widespread distribution of chloroquine, antifolate and multidrug resistance markers, with the highest mutant rate in southern Myanmar. Surveillance on drug resistance malaria is of great concern for global control and elimination of malaria. As drug-resistant vivax was reported as early as 1980s, its exact global burden is still unknown. Compared to falciparum malaria, drug resistance studies of vivax which focus on epidemiology, drug efficacy and drug resistance mechanism are rare. Drug resistance malaria can be detected by in vivo TES studies, molecular maker analysis, in vitro drug susceptibility testing and drug concentration measurement. Lack of a standardized culture system limits the usefulness of in vitro susceptibility tests for detection of drug resistance. Although in vivo TES were accepted as a standard method for drug resistance detection, recurrent parasitaemia cases needed to be distinguished between re-infection, recrudescence or relapse. Relapse patterns of vivax malaria also widely differ across geographical regions and no standardized method to exclude relapse or re-infection in TF cases leads to difficulties in interpretation of findings of TES. Currently, clinical surveillance with chloroquine drug level measurement has been accepted to confirm chloroquine-resistant vivax malaria. At least one TF case that showed whole blood concentration of chloroquine plus desethylchloroquine more than 100 ng/mL was observed in ten countries: Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Malaysia (Borneo), Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Solomon Islands, and Thailand [ 6 ]. Although there are no validated molecular markers for drug-resistant vivax malaria, potential candidates were reported. Most of these candidate markers [ 7 – 9 ] were homologues of falciparum drug resistance makers, such as pvmdr1 , pvdhp and pvdhfr . K10 insertion (‘AAG’ insert) in first exon at tenth position of pvcrt - O was also suggested as a chloroquine resistance marker [ 7 , 10 ]; it was observed in Thailand (56–89%) [ 7 , 10 ] and Myanmar (46%) [ 7 ]. In this study, the highest rate of K10 inset alleles was observed in Shwegyin (central Myanmar) (72.7%) followed by Kawthaung (southern Myanmar) (66.7%) and Buthidaung (western Myanmar) (48.3%) indicating high chloroquine resistance in southern Myanmar, which is similar to the artemisinin resistance status [ 11 ]. As the chloroquine is the first line treatment for vivax malaria in Myanmar, K10 insert of pvcrt - O gene was widely distributed in all three study sites. Y976F mutation of pvmdr1 was found to be associated with reduced susceptibility of chloroquine in Thailand and Indonesia [ 12 ] but not in Madagascar [ 13 ]. Moreover, Y976F of pvmdr1 gene has been associated with higher susceptibility to artesunate and mefloquine [ 12 ]. In this study, Y976F was detected in Kawthaung (26.7%), Shwegyin (17.0%) and Buthidaung (1.7%). Compared to neighbouring countries, Y976F was highest in Cambodia (89%) [ 14 ], followed by Thailand (8–25%) [ 10 , 14 , 15 ], China–Myanmar border (3%) [ 16 ], and India (0%) [ 17 ]. Another mutation of pvmdr1 , F1096L was observed widely but was suggested to be neutral for drug resistance [ 18 ]. In combined analysis of pvcrt - O and pvmdr1 mutations, chloroquine resistance markers were widely distributed in all three study sites but with a lower mutant rate in western Myanmar. Similarly, pvdhps and pvdhfr showed a significant role in antifolate drug-resistant vivax malaria [ 19 ]. F57I/L, S58R, T61M, and S117T/N of pvdhfr were found to be associated with pyrimethamine resistance [ 20 ] and S382A, S383G, A553G of pvdhps were associated with sulfadoxine resistance [ 21 ]. Plasmodium vivax was supposed to have a certain degree of innate resistance to sulfadoxine and S383G and A553G could be responsible inducers for resistance [ 22 ]. In Myanmar, relatively high rates of these mutations were noted in southern and central Myanmar. Double mutations (S58R and S117T/N) or quadruple mutations (F57L/I, S58R, T61M, and S117T) of pvdhfr gene were found in Thailand (96%), Myanmar (71%), Korea (1%), Cambodia (94%), and India (40%) [ 23 , 24 ]. In this study, overall quadruple mutations was 147/208 (70.7%) and contributed more than half of samples in all three study sites, indicating high pyrimethamine resistance in Myanmar. According to pvdhps and pvdhfr data, antifolate resistance in vivax infection in Myanmar should not be neglected, although sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is not the drug of choice for vivax malaria. Within 2009–2016, treatment regimen for vivax malaria was not changed and trend on clinical efficacy of chloroquine is similar except some fluctuations in Kawthaung study site. It is difficult to rule-out the drug resistance factor resulting in treatment failure in this study sites without molecular analysis in previous years. As the drug resistance alone is not responsible for treatment failure [ 4 ], clinical response and prevalence of molecular markers is not similar in this study. Conclusions This study is the first multisite, clinical and molecular surveillance of drug-resistant vivax malaria in Myanmar, exploring the neglected niche of the infection. According to current anti-malarial treatment guidelines in Myanmar, chloroquine is the first-line treatment for vivax malaria. Most of the study sites showed 100% ACPR except in the southern and western Myanmar sites. Wide distribution of chloroquine and antifolate resistance molecular markers revealed the spread of the drug-resistant parasite population in Myanmar. High mutant rates of most of the vivax drug resistance molecular markers in southern and central Myanmar were similar to that of artemisinin resistance falciparum malaria, indicating higher anti-malarial resistance burden of falciparum and vivax in southern Myanmar. An appropriate strategy and action plan to contain or eliminate drug-resistant vivax malaria in Myanmar is recommended.
