(AP/LM Otero) Despite being one of the most consistently productive big men in the NBA, Chris Bosh’s career has been cut short for the past two seasons due to an ongoing blood clot condition. Due to the severity of his ailment, the Miami Heat were forced to cut ties with the 32-year-old stretch forward, a move that also brought a cloud of uncertainty on whether or not Bosh could still return to the hardwood. NBA: Bosh career with Heat likely over — team chief ADVERTISEMENT But according to an ESPN report, the Chicago Bulls are reportedly very interested to acquire Bosh’s services next season, if he will be medically cleared to play. Technically, the two-time NBA champion is still under contract with the Heat through 2018 to 2019, but the club can officially waive him from its payroll starting February 9. However, earlier reports have indicated that team president Pat Riley intends to let him go on March 1—which will prevent him from joining another team for the playoffs, in case he heals up in time. While healthy, Bosh was among the league’s premiere forwards and was highly touted for his versatility on the court, possessing the ability to either play on the post or stretch opposing defenses with his potent outside shooting. In 13 seasons split between the Toronto Raptors and the Heat, Bosh averaged 19.2 points, 8.5 rebounds, two assists and a block, while also being selected to play in 11 All-Star games. Chicago’s supposed interest may be a bid to reunite Bosh with long-time Heat teammate and recently acquired guard Dwyane Wade. The Windy City franchise currently has a log jam up front with bigs Robin Lopez, Taj Gibson, Nikola Mirotic, Bobby Portis and Cristiano Felicio rounding up the rotation on a nightly basis. A player with Bosh’s caliber, however, is too good to pass up, if he will indeed be healthy enough to play next season.
