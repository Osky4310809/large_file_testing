creative consultancy masquespacio presents its latest design for the hikari yakitori bar, the second project from the founders of nozomi sushi bar which is located in the same district of ruzafa in valencia , two steps ahead from their actual restaurant . a fter the big success of nozomi sushi bar with a waiting list of 2 months, founders josé miguel and nuria — together with their disciple clara — have decided to continue studying their passion for japanese food. this time, they wanted to introduce an innovative concept through this project, traduced literally in a skewers bar that carries on the name of a high velocity japanese train. \nhikari yakitori bar, front façade \nthe interior designed by masquespacio has been influenced by the different quarters and alleys of kabukicho, omoide yokocho y hajimeya in tokyo — where most of the yakitori bars are established. ‘ we went to one of the most authentic neighborhoods in tokyo, bringing back their noise and smell but reinventing their visual pollution ‘, explains the studio. starting from the façade, one can recognize the entrance as one of tokyo’s tunnels that invites people to enter the intimate yet eclectic hub. with its dimmed light and flames coming out of the kitchen, visitors are captured from beginning to end. at this point, one notices the duality of noble and industrial materials, classic and contemporary — always through a vision that clearly represents the identity of nozomi’s company. \nentrance bar and kitchen station \n\n‘ the reinterpretation of the kabukicho, omoide yokocho y hajimeya alleys is done through a monochrome color scheme represented by grey and rusty finishes, as well as a touch of wood that adds warmth to the overall concept. during our walk till the end of the tunnel, we can see how wood is mixed with concrete and metal while the classic lanterns cast a shadow of typical alley light in the corridor ‘, adds masquespacio. at some point, visitors enter a square full of lighted boards that hang from the ceiling, a small food stand and a reinterpreted design of a famous district in the japanese capital — here used like a set of small houses where users can settle. \nthe light sculptures evoke the neon signs that create strong visual pollutions in the city of tokyo \n\nfrom metal to cement and wood interiors below a dimmed light, food lovers get to enjoy an overwhelming view of the central place which is full of contrasts and visual dynamics — as if they wear sitting in one of the most authentic streets of the nippon city . ‘t he light sculptures hanging from the ceiling and the walls are a metaphor of the neon signs that create a strong visual pollution on the bustling streets of tokyo’ , describes the team. \nthe square includes wooden seating stations underneath a tunnel-like ceiling \nmonochrome colors are embedded into grey and rusty finishes \nthe entrance replicates the character of a tunnel in tokyo \nsquare entrance point \ntraditional overhead japanese lantern offer an overwhelming and contrasting experience \nfood stand re-interprets one of the most famous commercial districts in the japanese capital \nfood
