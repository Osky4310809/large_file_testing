Charlie Clements shared this selfie as he nears 30 (Photo: Twitter/Charlie Clements) He's changed a lot over the years (Photo: BBC) \nHowever, his style has changed even more drastically since then. He appeared as Bradley Branning until 2010 (Photo: BBC) \n\"A year ago everyone was up in arms because I looked SO different at 28 to 18,\" he joked on Instagram. \"Bet they didn't expect this at 29! #actor #chameleon\" \nAfter leaving EastEnders - and earning the 'Best Exit' prizes at the British Soap and Inside Soap awards in the process - he has kept busy with his career on camera. He looked very different on Loose Women last year (Photo: Rex Features) He's kept busy (Photo: Rex Features) \nAs well as a stint in Casualty as Jake O'Reilly in 2013, two years later he appeared in Murdoch Mystereries as Charlie Brackenreid. \nMore recently, he has worked on drama Elizabeth And Her Enemies.
