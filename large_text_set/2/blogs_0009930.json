Shameful & irresponsible headline. Only illegal immigrants get deported. Stop purposefully confusing the issue. https://t.co/haKwkk6wwG \n— Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) February 12, 2017 \nExactly. \nWhy in the world would someone who isn’t an illegal immigrant care about this? \nIf you are a Hispanic who is in this country legally then the only reason you’d be afraid is because of misleading media narratives like this. \nLooks like some other people agree with that. @thehill not this Hispanic or in my family because parents came here legally so no not all Hispanics \n— Karina n Taylor (@KarinanTaylor23) February 12, 2017 @thehill Hispanics? I'm not worried because I'm legal and Hispanic.
