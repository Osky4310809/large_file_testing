Apparently, to keep a \"consistent fan policy,\" AMD has placed a 20C offset on the Ryzen 1700X and 1800X products, making them report temperature a good 20C above what the sensor reads. This interesting design choice may most assuredly be confusing to end users, but AMD is confident software will soon automatically adjust for this offset and report the true temperature when required. In the same blog post detailing the changes on the 1700X and 1800X, AMD claims that temperature reporting \"may be offset on certain CPU models so that all models on the AM4 Platform have the same maximum tCTL value.\" This could mean other future models would utilize a similar setup, so remember that moving forward with AMD's Zen-based lineup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:26:00.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
