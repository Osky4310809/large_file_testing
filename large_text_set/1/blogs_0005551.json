Photo: BACtrack \nGetting a reading of your blood-alcohol content levels is about to become as easy as glancing at your Apple Watch. \nThe first-ever wearable alcohol monitor made its debut at CES in Las Vegas this week, giving drinkers a new option for keeping track of whether or not they’re fit to get behind the wheel. \nThe tiny new wearable comes from BACtrack, which is popular for making pocket-size breathalyzers. Dubbed the BACtrack Skyn , the small sensor can be worn as on its own, or as an Apple Watch band that syncs seamlessly with your iPhone too. \nWhat’s great about the BACtrack Skyn is it can provide real-time analysis of how drunk you are, so you can see how the beers are effecting you. Instead of having to guess how your last drink is going to effect you in a few hours, Skyn can make estimations of how drunk you will be later so you can better plan your night. \nBACtrack plans to launch the new sensor during the summer. It will cost $99 making it a non-brainer gift for college kids looking to test their limits, or anyone else that loves imbibing fine ales, wines and spirits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:14:44.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
