Get thee to the tipline and send us your suggestions. We'd love to see what you've got. Location: Palm Springs, California Price: $3,700,000 The epitome of the glamorous Palm Springs lifestyle, this beauty by renowned desert modernist John Porter Clark also happened to be home to Hollywood legends including Tippi Hedren and William Holden and Stefanie Powers . Built in 1956, the sprawling 4,449-square-foot abode has since been dazzlingly renovated— as can be peeped in a few before photos —and “returned to its original footprint,” spotlighting its pure, minimalist lines as exemplified in its flat, cantilevering roof, planar surfaces, and gigantic pivoting glass walls that thrust open the five-bedroom to an expansive lawn and pool. Now finished in all-white when it was previously tan and brown, with custom marble stonework found throughout, the property practically gleams. The generous desert sun floods the home with natural light thanks to all that glazing, and the original post-and-beam construction and tongue-and-groove ceiling aid in projecting the house even further outward to establish seamless indoor-outdoor living. Set on nearly an acre of land with stunning views of the San Jacinto mountains, the residence offers up incredible entertaining options, too, from the huge kitchen, to the formal sitting area with open fireplace, the multiple patios, and, of course, the pool. You’re going to have to shell out a pretty penny— $3,700,000, to be exact—for your chance to own this special property located at 1323 South Driftwood Drive .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:16:49.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
