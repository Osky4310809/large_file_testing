The \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! \nTrump stated last week, after President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia over allegations they directed hacking to influence the election, that he would meet with the heads of the intelligence agencies to be briefed on the situation. \nRegarding the issue of this being delayed, there are reports that the briefing was always scheduled for Friday. Now: Senior US intelligence official tells NBC News briefing was \"always\" scheduled for Friday, Trump incorrect, per @KenDilanianNBC https://t.co/hBP1lJln6W \n— Ari Melber (@AriMelber) January 4, 2017 \nTrump has long been a skeptic on Russian’s involvement in hacking, saying the CIA’s assessment that the country tried to influence the election to help Trump was “ridiculous.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:54:51.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
