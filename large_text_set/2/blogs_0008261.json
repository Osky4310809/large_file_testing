I won the fight but got unjust verdict ... he talking all this s*** let’s just have a 3rd & I guarantee a KO his bitch ass #mundinevgreen3 #ifthep***ydares #hisabum,” Mundine wrote. \nMundine won the first bout between the two in Sydney in 2006, but Green got his revenge at the Adelaide Oval in a fight that went the full 10 rounds. Since his win he’s poured cold water on any notion of another fight to complete a mouth-watering trilogy, but Mundine isn’t so willing to accept his latest defeat. \nHis camp appealed the result — scored 94-94, 96-94 and 98-90 in Green's favour — because there are concerns over the way it was scored, penalties imposed on Mundine during the contest and claims of bias among the judges. media_camera Green emerged the happier after the fight. \nSpeaking on Perth radio station Mix 94.5 last week, Green said he wasn’t surprised Mundine chose to go down this path . \n“All it is is an appeal, it doesn’t mean anything’s going to happen,” Green said. “I expect nothing less from such a poor sport. \n“He showed disgraceful sportsmanship in the ring and I expect nothing less from someone of his character — his poor character — after the fight.” \nGreen also reinforced his belief that an illegal Mundine punch inside the opening minute was a “dog shot” that prevented him from dominating the fight. \n“I’m just disappointed not to carry it out how I felt for the first 30-45 seconds. I felt very confident he was s****ing himself — you could see the look in his eyes,” Green said. \n“I hit him with a couple of clean shots, I felt sharp early, then he threw that dog shot and it just changed the game. \n“It was just a disgraceful foul, it was incredible that he did it.” \nIf the Australian National Boxing Federation agrees to hear Mundine’s appeal, three independent local judges will be locked into three separate rooms with videos of the fight and new scorecards. Their score counts will determine if Green’s win stands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T09:34:43.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
