The novel features “newspeak,” a language that eliminates the possibility of independent thought, and “doublethink,” which Orwell describes as the ability to believe contradictory ideas.\nThe current description for the book on Amazon, calls it a “chilling prophecy about the future,” adding “And while 1984 has come and gone, Orwell’s narrative is timelier than ever.”\nWashington Post reporter Karen Tumulty made the comparison between Conway’s comments and Orwell’s book on CNN’s Reliable Sources , calling “alternative facts” a “George Orwell phrase.”\nConway used the phrase while defending comments made by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Sunday’s “ Meet the Press .”\nThe book’s sales were soaring even before Conway’s comments, though. A spokesman for publisher Signet Classics told NPR that the “1984” has seen nearly 10,000 percent increase in sales since the inauguration. The “alternative facts” debacle created another boost and Penguin USA has ordered 75,000 new copies of the book to match the growth.\nThis isn’t the first time Trump’s presidency has boosted a book’s sales. In November, Sinclair Lewis’ 1935 novel “It Can’t Happen Here,” which focuses on the democracy’s fragility, jumped to No. 1 on Amazon’s best-seller list. It currently sits at No. 7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:39:02.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
