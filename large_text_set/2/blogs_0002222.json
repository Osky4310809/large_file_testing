Howe was busy in the last January window (Photo: Alex Livesey/Getty) \nThey signed England under-19s keeper Aaron Ramsdale from Sheffield United and he is regarded as an outstanding prospect and one for the future. \nBut there was nothing else as all of their targets went awry and they missed out on a string of players in the final week. Read More 10 things we learned from the Premier League this week as Chelsea's rivals fail to close the gap \nOften in football there is a belief that even a new face can give a squad and a dressing room a huge lift no matter who it is. It is just good to get a new body in. \nBournemouth went for lofty targets which would have definitely improved the squad as they bid more than £10m for Chelsea’s No2 keeper Asmir Begovic . Bournemouth were after JT on loan but failed to secure a deal (Photo: AFP) \nThe deal would have happened if Chelsea had been able to buy a new back-up keeper but their own targets did not come off and they refused to let Begovic go. \nBournemouth were also interested in making a permanent deal for Chelsea’s Nathan Ake who they had on loan this season but offered £18m late in the window. \nThey were juggling balls in the air, having been linked with John Terry, above, and also enquired about Branislav Ivanovic before he joined Zenit St Petersburg . Reece Oxford ended up joining Reading on loan (Photo: Arfa Griffiths) \nBournemouth were interested in West Ham’s Reece Oxford , above, who was available on loan and there was a sniff of interest in trying to sign a couple of right backs. \nBut they missed out on them all and by the time they went back for Oxford he was going to Reading on loan and they waited too long on Begovic because there was no time to get another keeper. Read More Andrew Surman admits Bournemouth have to be “very careful” after dip in form leads to relegation fears \nBournemouth have had a dip in form, having not won in 2017 and they also had a worrying dip in form at the back end of last season. \nHowe’s men surely have enough of a cushion above the relegation zone to be safe but Bournemouth’s attempts to push on during the run-in have taken a major blow because of their lack of success in January.
