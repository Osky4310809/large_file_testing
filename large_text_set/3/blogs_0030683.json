Credit: Alistair Tutton Most Popular \nRussell Stover Chocolates, the largest U.S. manufacturer of boxed chocolates, has picked VML as its agency of record, a strategic shift after working with FleishmanHillard for about a year. \nRussell Stover confirmed its relationship with VML began in February after the company considered a number of agencies in a competitive review handled internally. The Kansas City, Mo.-based chocolate maker primarily considered advertising agencies in the Kansas City area. \nWPP's VML, which is also based in Kansas City, will handle a variety of work for Russell Stover including plans for a campaign set to launch later this year. \nRussell Stover is best known for products such as red heart-shaped boxes of chocolates for Valentine's Day. It is also the brand Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump was eating when he said: \"My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.\" \nThe appointment comes after Russell Stover named FleishmanHillard its first communications agency of record in January 2016. At that time, FleishmanHillard said it would work on social media, digital and public relations strategies, and content creation. Russell Stover said it is no longer working with FleishmanHillard, which had handled the account out of its Chicago office.

Those adjustments \"had a negative impact on sales during the financial year, while at the same time laying the long-term foundation for profitable growth in the future.\" \nLindt & Spr端ngli also said Russell Stover's new seasonal products for Christmas, Easter and Valentine's Day launched \"very successfully\" and that the unit has been stepping up online advertising and its presence on social media. \nRussell Stover traces its history back to 1923. That's when Clara and Russell Stover started making candy in their Denver home and called their company Mrs. Stover's Bungalow Candies. The chocolate manufacturer changed its name to Russell Stover Candies 20 years later. In 1993, it acquired Whitman's Candies, which got its start with a small shop in Philadelphia in 1842.
