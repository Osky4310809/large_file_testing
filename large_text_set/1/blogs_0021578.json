He posted on his Facebook profile Friday that he’s “concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump,” especially the ones related to immigration restriction.\nHe writes, “Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don’t pose a threat will live in fear of deportation.” Zuckerberg advocated for continuing to allow refugees into the country and keeping the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in place.\nFacebook Post .

CEO Marissa Mayer, Netflix CEO Reid Hoffman, and Zuckerberg himself. The initiative launched a failed bid for reform in 2013 and restarted in late 2015.\nZuckerberg spoke out against the president while he was campaigning but had remained silent about him after the election.\nSome have criticized the timing and narrowness of Zuckerberg argument as he calls out the “best and the brightest” immigrants, foreshadowing a debate over the H1-B visas for highly skilled foreign workers.\nhow to read this: H1-B visa discussion imminent, and your employees are getting restless. you HAVE to say something… https://t.co/Zg0u65vcg5\n— ಠ_ಠ (@MikeIsaac) ID: 10415090 Zuckerberg’s comments come on National Holocaust Remembrance day.
