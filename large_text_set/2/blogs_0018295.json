These threats are being investigated as civil rights violations and arrive as vandals damaged over 100 headstones at a Jewish cemetery in Missouri. \nThe phoned-in bomb threats weren’t directed at one section of the country , as “Alabama, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Florida, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas and New York” were targeted. Thankfully, the calls were hoaxes, and no one was hurt, but this is a continuation of ongoing threats against the Jewish community.\nMeanwhile in Missouri, nearly 200 headstones at the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery were defaced and knocked over , according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . The White House condemned the attacks with Press Secretary Sean Spicer saying that hate-motivated violence has “no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom.” Ivanka Trump, who converted to Judaism for her marriage, echoed Spicer’s comments on Twitter:\nAmerica is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC \n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017 \n\nOn Tuesday morning, Trump spoke out against the attacks (“anti-Semitism is horrible and it’s going to stop”) while visiting the National Museum of African American History:\n. @POTUS after a rash of threats/vandalism at Jewish institutions: “Anti-semitism is horrible and it’s going to stop. It has to stop.” pic.twitter.com/25Tj86iJI9 \n— Tom Namako (@TomNamako) February 21, 2017 \nHis condemnation arrives after Trump told a Jewish reporter to “sit down” when he asked about the threats at last week’s combative press conference . Earlier on Tuesday morning, Hillary Clinton tweet-urged “everyone” to speak out on these attacks, beginning with Trump.\nJCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS .\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 21, 2017 \n\n(Via NBC News , CNN , The Jerusalem Post & St. Louis Dispatch )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:13:43.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
