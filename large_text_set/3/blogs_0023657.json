The FBI is reportedly investigating possible election-related collusion between Stone and the Russian government.

WikiLeaks included in the tweet a link to an article detailing a series of allegations against Stone. \nStone claims he has communicated with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange through an intermediary. \nThe Trump adviser has been accused of having advance knowledge of WikiLeaks’ publication of Democratic officials’ emails–a charge Stone has denied. \nStone demanded the chance to clear his name by testifying in front of the House Intelligence Community in a letter sent to reporters this week . \n“I am anxious to rebut allegations that I had any improper or nefarious contact with any agent of the Russia State based on facts, not misleading and salacious headlines,” Stone wrote. “Claims of Russian influence or collusion in the Trump Campaign by the Intelligence Community are backed up by ZERO evidence.” \n“I demand the right to face my accusers,” Stone added. “I will deconstruct their lies and spank them like children.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:20:42.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
