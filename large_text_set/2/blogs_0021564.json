Via TED : \"How do we make sense of today's political divisions? In a wide-ranging conversation full of insight, historian Yuval Harari places our current turmoil in a broader context, against the ongoing disruption of our technology, climate, media -- even our notion of what humanity is for. This is the first of a series of TED Dialogues, seeking a thoughtful response to escalating political divisiveness. Make time (just over an hour) for this fascinating discussion between Harari and TED curator Chris Anderson.\" \"I think the basic thing that happened is we have lost our story. Humans think in stories and we try to make sense of the world by telling stories,\" the historian said. \"And for the last few decades we had a very simple and very attractive story about what was happening in the world. And the story said that the economy is being globalized, politics is being liberalized, and the combination of the two will create paradise on earth. And we just need to keep globalizing the economy and liberalizing the political system, and everything will be wonderful.\" \"2016 is when a very large segment of the Western world stopped believing in this story,\" he said. \"For good or bad reason it doesn't matter, people stopped believing the story, and when you don't have a story it is hard to understand what is happening.\" \"The old 20th century political model of left vs. right is now basically irrelevant and the real divide today is between global and national, global or local. All over the world this is not the main struggle.\" Related Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:27:59.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
