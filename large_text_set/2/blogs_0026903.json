Once upon a time, Prince went down on his knees to propose to his rumoured girlfriend, and they also went for a holiday together to Goa. \nThe two may have been tight lipped about their relationship status, but Karan Kundra spilled the beans that they are a couple . BL asked Prince about the same and the Badho Bahu actor replied: \nKuch hua toh aap logon ko pata chal jayega. We are like buddies. I like her but we are too busy in our careers. She is working hard on her projects. We have a couple of tracks coming up, one in a soft romantic song featuring Yuvi and me and the other is a solo one. Okay… but do they plan to make it official anytime soon? \nI wish main iska jawab abhi de pata . Usne mujhe haan ki hoti… main propose karu and woh haan kare, it will be news for 2017. \nAww! Would you like to see #YuviPrince together?
