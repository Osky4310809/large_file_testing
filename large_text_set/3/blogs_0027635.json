Philstar.com/John Unson \nNORTH COTABATO, Philippines - Communist rebels occupied an upland barangay in Antipas town in North Cotabato early Thursday and forced hundreds of villagers to leave at gunpoint. \nProvincial and municipal education officials immediately decided to shut down all schools in Barangay Camutan in Antipas and evacuated school children to safer areas. \nAntipas Mayor Egidio Cadungon, chairman of the municipal peace and order council, confirmed the occupation of Barangay Camutan by hundreds of New People’s Army (NPA) guerillas who arrived there at past 6:00 a.m. Thursday. \nBarangay officials said the NPAs immediately looted houses, collected money from villagers and took their farm animals. \nArmy and police intelligence units are now validating reports purporting that the NPAs are holding 70 residents captive, to be used as “human shields” if the military will drive them away. \nBarangay Camutan is a hinterland barangay close to mountain ranges where there is heavy NPA presence.   \nThe first to evacuate immediately after the NPAs arrived in Barangay Camutan were 47 families driven away at gunpoint after having been robbed of their money, wristwatches, farm tools, clothes and livestock in their yards. \nThe rebels also ransacked and took goods for sale in sari-sari stores abandoned by owners. \nCadungon said the attack also caused panic in neighboring barangays. \nBarangay officials have sent emissaries to the rebels to convince their commanders to set their hostages free.
