Photo by Raffy Lerma \nThe Philippine women’s volleyball team for the coming Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur should make an immediate impact to gauge its competitiveness for the 2018 Asian Games. \n“The SEA Games is something that we really need to take seriously as other countries are taking it seriously as well,’’ said Philippine Olympic Committee 1st vice president Joey Romasanta during Tuesday’s Philippine Sportswriters Association forum at the Golden Phoenix Hotel in Pasay City. \nThe Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas Inc. under acting president Peter Cayco has conducted a series of tryouts at the Arellano gym in Pasay as well as in Cebu and Davao City to find those talents who could fit the association’s dream team for the KL Games on Aug. 19-31.

They’re also looking ahead to the Asian Games set in Indonesia, an unchartered territory for the women’s team and Philippine volleyball in general. \nPresent volleyball stars Jovelyn Gonzaga, Rachel Anne Daquis, Aby Marano, libero Denden Lazaro and towering sisters Jaja Santiago and Dindin Manabat-Santiago could form the core of the team. \nShakey’s V-league star Alyssa Valdez has also expressed desire to join the squad. \n“Performing well in the SEA Games is important for them to impress everybody that they will be deserving of slots in the Asian Games,’’ said Romasanta, the former head of the LVPI. \n“In terms of competitiveness, the Asian Games is an Olympic level competition. Other wealthy countries in Southeast Asia have already formed their teams for the SEA Games. They have also prepared a four-year plan going into the Olympics,’’ added Romasanta during the forum backed by Accel and San Miguel Corporation. \nCayco said the LVPI, through the efforts of women’s head coach Francis Vicente, has identified one prospect in Davao and two in Cebu to join the team which also saw libero Jen Reyes, Myla Pablo, Ellaine Kasilag, UST’s Sisi Rondina, Ria Meneses, Carla Sandoval, Chloe Cortez and UP middle blocker Kathy Bersola as some of the hopefuls. \n“There was a detailed program for the men’s and women’s teams that was submitted to the (SEAG) task force,’’ said Cayco. “As far as the players who are now in the thick of tournaments, the coaching staff allows them to first finish their tournament and report back in practice,’’ he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:27:12.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
