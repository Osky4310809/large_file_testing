However, speaking during a PaleyFest panel event in Los Angeles, the 47-year-old actor spoke about whys she’s stayed on the show for so long, and we absolutely love her reasoning.\nDespite running for 12 years, Grey’s Anatomy has proven that it’s a show with staying power, and is perhaps more important now more than ever before. Luckily, it seems that executives at ABC agree, too , with network boss Channing Dungey soothing fears that Grey’s could be ending anytime soon (the show has also been renewed for a 14th season ).\nNow Ellen Pompeo (aka Meredith Grey) has opened up about the show’s future and why she’s stuck at it for all these years. \nSpeaking during a panel at PaleyFest, Pompeo was asked about the show’s future, and why she feels like she’s done the show for as many seasons as she has.\n“Maybe why I’ve been able to do this show for so long is because I try not to have expectations,” she explained, before adding that it was a philosophy for her life.\n“I do the same thing in my life, I try not to look down the road too far because we’re going to miss what happens right now today,” she said. “I try to enjoy every moment with an open heart and an open mind… Life will tell me where I”m going. I don’t want to think about what’s next, I want to enjoy this moment.” This isn’t the first time that Ellen Pompeo has spoken about her decision to stay in Grey’s Anatomy . Last year the star opened up about how, because of ageism and sexism in her chosen field, she decided to stick with the show. \n“My decision to stay on Grey’s was based solely on age. At 33, I was wise enough to know my clock was already ticking in Hollywood. If I’d been younger, I probably would have done my time, then gone out to search for other things,” she said. “But I was definitely aware of how challenging it would be to find other roles in my late 30s and early 40s. I am very happy that I made the decision to stay. It’s only gotten better with time.” \nTbh, we’re so glad that Ellen decided to stay with the show and continues to do so. While we know that Grey ‘ s could continue without her character, Meredith, things just wouldn’t be the same without her narrating the opening and closing of each episode, and we’d totally miss her. She’s one of the most complex characters on TV, and we need that in our lives.\nMeanwhile, Ellen Pompeo recently made her directorial debut with an upcoming episode of Grey’s Anatomy , which is expected to air on March 30th.\nGrey’s Anatomy continues Thursdays on ABC.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T13:30:23.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
