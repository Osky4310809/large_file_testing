I really believe in the team and think we can do a good job this year.\" \nNico Hulkenberg joined his new team-mate at the launch, with the German starting a new chapter of his career after ending his five-year stint with Force India. \nHulkenberg wasn't the only fresh recruit on show, with Sergey Sirotkin officially confirmed as the team's reserve driver, while four-time world champion Alain Prost has been brought in as a 'special advisor' as Renault look to return to the front of the grid. \nBut despite these lofty ambitions, Hulkenberg - without a podium in his 115 Grands Prix starts - believes 2017 represents another stepping stone in the team's development as they aim to build up to title challengers by the end of the decade. \n\"We are very optimistic but at the same time you have to be realistic,\" said Hulkenberg. \n\"Renault came from a long way back last year and I think we have a lot of work to do to catch up to the midfield, not even talking about the very front. \n\"I just want to grow with the team, build the team step-by-step. I still think this is a bit of a build-up year for us ahead of hopefully bigger success in the upcoming years.\" \nHulkenberg was, however, excited by Renault's new car, claiming it looks \"racy, fast and aggressive\", with technical chief Bob Bell adding that the car should be around four seconds quicker than last year's. \n\"I'm really excited and looking forward to it,\" Hulkenberg added. \"It's a new chapter, a new team and I really look forward to get to the track, start working with the new people and get down to business.\" \nThe first F1 pre-season test starts on Monday, February 27 and the Sky Sports F1 Digital team will be providing live commentary from dawn until dusk on all four days while Sky Sports News HQ will also deliver live updates from trackside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:04:07.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
