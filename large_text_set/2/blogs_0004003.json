(GeekWire Photo / Monica Nickelsburg) Seventeen states — in addition to Washington and Minnesota — are asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit not to undo a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), which brought Trump’s travel and immigration ban to a grinding halt Friday.\nThe following states filed a 29-page amicus brief challenging the federal government’s request to stay the TRO:\nNew York California Connecticut Delaware Illinois Iowa Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Mexico Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont Virginia District of Columbia Hawaii has also filed a request to join Washington and Minnesota as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which claims Trump’s executive order is unconstitutional and violates immigration law. Washington was the first state to sue the Trump Administration over the order and also requested the emergency TRO, which Judge James Robart granted in the U.S. District Court for Western Washington Friday.\nOver the weekend, the Department of Justice filed a motion to stay the TRO, followed by a swift challenge from the states. The court denied the stay but the federal government is expected to counter by 3 p.m. today.\nThe states’ amicus brief joins a chorus of private companies, non-profits, and other organizations that have voiced their support of Washington and Minnesota’s lawsuit. Nearly 100 companies — including Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Uber, and others — filed a brief overnight supporting the states’ case.\nRead states’ full amicus brief below.\n17 States Join Washington v.
