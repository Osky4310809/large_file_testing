Sutton goalkeeper's pie-eating stunt earns him the wrath of boss \nRichard Watson, commission enforcement and intelligence director, said: “Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened. \n“As part of that we’ll be looking into any irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity.” \nThe commission had previously warned bookmakers over “issues of integrity” linked to novelty betting markets. \nShaw, 23-stone, said: “A few of the lads said to me earlier on what is going on with the 8-1 about eating a pie. Sutton United's Wayne Shaw on Good Morning Britain \n“I said I don't know I have eaten nothing all day. So I might give it a go later on. \n“As I say what is that, they had us at 8-1 to eat a pie. I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down. \n“I went and got it at half time from the kitchen, I had it all prepared and ready to go. It was meat and potato.” In Pictures | Sutton United vs Arsenal | 20/02/2017 In Pictures | Sutton United vs Arsenal | 20/02/2017 1/50", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:08:52.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
