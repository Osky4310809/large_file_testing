The relatively new plus-size British model boasts 90k followers and counting, that double tap her photos of her modeling adventures, from glam photo shoots to chic new campaigns. (You've probably seen her modeling for ASOS Curve and Ashley Stewart.) I'm not a fan of the phrase \"girl crush\" but that's basically what I have on Hayward. She's startling beautiful—especially in person—with her platinum blonde hair and eyeliner that can could a bitch. But she's not just her looks. Hayward is an outspoken body-positive activist, who preaches self love everywhere she goes. In fact, she recently founded the Self Love Brings Beauty movement, helping women (and men!) feel better about themselves. Didn't I tell you she was great? Hayward is wearing her own Self Loves Brings Beauty merch in our latest Dispelling Beauty Myths video with StyleLikeU. Just like she's so open on Instagram (have you seen her ode to her cellulite ?), the model gets really real in our video. She gives her honest thoughts on how people react when she tells them she's a model, what guys think about her stretch marks (hint: they don't care about them), and how she herself feels about those little lines.
