(Ray Mark Rinaldi, Special to The Denver Post) \n“Force/Resistance” is the kind of audacious art exhibit that can get a museum in hot water. It doesn’t hold back for a second on its depiction of police brutality in America, with graphic images of cops pointing guns at kids’ heads, aiming bullets at innocent mothers, pummeling and pulling the hair of suspects who have already been restrained. \nThe exhibit’s centerpiece, Dáreece Walker’s in-your-face drawings, impart a bold heroism on those who strike back at law enforcement. In one work, a man sits in a lawn chair casually smoking a cigarette. Behind him a police van is a wreck in flames. \nThe scenes, covering the walls of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, will feel familiar to anyone who watches the news on cable television. The cops are faceless warriors and their victims, all of them, are black. They’re drawn loosely from recent stories of race-related violence that have played out in cities across the country in the wake of deadly police actions against African-Americans. Floyd Tunson’s “Endangered 8.” (Acrylic on canvas, 60″ x 48″) was painted in 1995. (Provided by the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center.) \nIt’s a one-sided story for sure, the unbridled presentation of a single artist’s personal truth, and a young artist at that. Walker, who is from Colorado Springs, got his masters in fine arts just last year. But the work is raw, powerful and provocative in meaningful ways. It’s also something museum curators tend to avoid — unless they want to anger half their visitors, donors, board members and the people who give out public funding. Oh, and maybe the local riot squad. \nBut the arts center plunges bravely ahead and does what museums do best with this kind of material: It adds context. In this case, Walker’s drawings are paired with paintings by Floyd Tunson, one of the most established and respected artists in the Springs these days. \nTunson, who is a few generations older than Walker, has been working for years on pieces that touch on the same themes. His multimedia creations cover a lot of subject areas — by no means is all of his work about race — but he’s not afraid to connect skin color and violence in his visceral and often disturbing art. \nTunson works in a variety of media — paint, photography, sculpture and installation, though he is well-known for a series of portraits he did in the 1990s that feature, most notably, hyper-close-up faces of young black males, some of them innocent, wide-eyed adolescents. The title of the series, “Endangered,” says a lot about the predicament of this particular demographic in the present-day United States. Several of the portraits are included in “Force/Resistance.” \nThat fact that Tunson made his pictures decades ago lends extra credence to the work of Walker. It’s a smart curatorial move that keeps viewers from dismissing the younger artist as reactionary or alarmist, or as a simple chronicler of current events. Tunson’s work lays both a historical and art-historical groundwork that places Walker in a line of serious artists who have something to say about the subject. \nWalker benefits in multiple ways from the pairing. He is a newcomer, and his work is the kind that critics and curators sometimes (wrongly) fail to see. His acrylic-on-vinyl drawings here are straight-forward, comic-influenced, and dripping in blood. They are direct and representational in an era when abstract art rules the game. Unframed and simply tacked to the wall as they are at the arts center, they lack the polish that would get Walker representation at most galleries.
