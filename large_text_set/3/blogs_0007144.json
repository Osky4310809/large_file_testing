(AAP) \nANALYSIS: In the past few days, Donald Trump has tweeted about Arnold Schwarzenegger , Vladimir Putin, ExxonMobil and wire-tapping . \nBut in the wake of the biggest national security leak since Edward Snowden, both Trump and his White House have been decidedly silent. \nTrump has not spoken or tweeted about the 8761 documents and files published by Wikileaks overnight that presents a scathing expose of the intelligence-gathering methods of the CIA . \nRead more: Ex-MI6 spy speaks about Trump dirt file \nAnd when given a chance to comment in a White House briefing, Press Secretary Sean Spicer declined to say anything. \nIt's unusual for an administration to keep mum about such a revelation. The White House could have accused Wikileaks of fabricating the evidence, or have expressed their concern about the privacy breaches, or have offered their resolute support to the CIA. \nBut by doing nothing, Trump is leaving the CIA out in the cold. \nIt can't be said this is a surprising response. Trump has been a vocal critic of the CIA, both pre- and post-election. And it does not seem like Trump to stand up for an organisation that he believes has worked to undermine his presidency. \nBut it is also not like Trump to criticise Wikileaks, which effectively worked to white-ant Hillary Clinton 's election campaign throughout last year. \nBy drip-feeding the emails of Clinton's campaign chair John Podesta , Wikileaks ensured Clinton spent much of her campaign playing defence. \nOn Saturday, Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone admitted he had a \"perfectly legal back channel\" to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange . \nThe confession was made in a furious tweet addressed at a statistics professor who accused him of libel for his remarks about Barack Obama. \n\"You stupid, stupid bitch – never denied perfectly legal back channel to Assange who indeed had the goods on #Crooked Hillary,\" Stone tweeted. \nStone later deleted the tweet, but not his revelation of collusion with Wikileaks did not go unnoticed. \nIt would make sense for Trump not to malign Wikileaks, the group that worked so feverishly to undermine his presidential opponent. \nTrump has a long-running habit of refusing to criticise people or groups that are supportive of him. \n\"I love Wikileaks,\" Trump said in a campaign speech in Pennsylvania a month before the election. \nAssange himself even admitted to having information about Donald Trump in August last year, but declined to release it to the public. Julian Assange. (AAP) \nIn January, Trump supported Assange's claims that Kremlin-backed hackers did not access emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) or from John Podesta. \nWhen Buzzfeed published a purported MI6 dossier documenting unsubstantiated claims about Donald Trump's business connections, personal grudges and sexual fetishes in January, Wikileaks declared it to be \"clearly bogus\". \nAssange is currently living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, as he avoids extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations . \nTrump's silence today may be because he is stumped on what to do, but as long as he refuses to rebuke Wikileaks or defend the CIA, there's going to be questions as to where his allegiances lie. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T15:02:06.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
