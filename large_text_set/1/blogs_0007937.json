DaMarcus Beasley, 34, and Chad Marshall, 32, are especially notable. Dax McCarty, 29, who hasn't been capped since 2011, is also set to participate. \nMcCarty likely didn't expect an invite, as the start of camp interferes with his wedding: Honored to get the chance to represent the #USMNT again. A callup and a wedding? 2017 off to a good start! Appreciate all the well wishes üëçüèª ‚Äî Dax McCarty (@DaxMcCarty11) January 5, 2017 Special thanks to Bruce for letting me come to camp late. Extremely special thanks to @JenZyski for letting me leave day after our wedding üòÇ ‚Äî Dax McCarty (@DaxMcCarty11) January 5, 2017 \nThe camp roster features a few players for whom fans have been calling to get a chance with the team, including Benny Feilhaber and Darlington Nagbe. Young players such as Sebastian Lletget, 24, and Kekuta Manneh, 22, will also get their first taste of senior team experience. \nOn the other hand, Chris Wondolowski is set to make another appearance, much to the dismay of many fans. \nDoug McIntyre of ESPN FC noted an interesting omission, however: No shock that Chris Wondolowski is on Arena‚Äôs first #usmnt roster. One minor surprise, sort of, is no Dempsey after Arena said he‚Äôd be in. ‚Äî Doug McIntyre (@DougMacESPN) January 5, 2017 \nClint Dempsey will apparently not be involved after missing time with a heart condition . \nArena, who took over for Klinsmann in November, coached the national team from 1998 to 2006. The USMNT's first match under new leadership will be a friendly against Serbia on Jan. 29, followed by a match against Jamaica on Feb. 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:39:35.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
