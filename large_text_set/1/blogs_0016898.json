The companies ranged from a Stanford AI labs spinout, Eloquent Labs, to the hardware-makers like Amber Agriculture and PubInno, to lots of software-as-a-service and cybersecurity developers, more like you’d expect from an incubator focused anything-but-consumer tech. \nThe diversity of startups in Alchemist’s latest batch indicates a sea change in enterprise tech, an the start of an era when robotics, AI and the internet of things are fundamentally changing the way that large companies get work done, from sales and physical labor to IT and data analysis. \nAlchemist founder Ravi Belani tells TechCrunch the latest class is the largest his program has ever graduated, as well. The program has gained notice, in part, because its alumni racked up lots of follow-on funding in recent years. Two of the biggest deals last year included a $28 million round for nutrition-focused health tech startup, Zipongo , and a $13 million investment in delivery drone makers Matternet. \nHere are the newest companies, with descriptions provided by Alchemist (edited for length). \nAmber Agriculture – Automates grain management for farmers using wireless sensors and data analytics. \nCloudastructure – Provides cloud-controlled infrastructure for enterprise, physical security using machine learning and computer vision around Access Control and Video Surveillance together, in a Cloud model. \nJirav – Forecasting and predictive Analytics for small business finance.
