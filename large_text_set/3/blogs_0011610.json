As we’ve been saying for the last few years, UConn is the team to beat. The Huskies were given the No. 1 overall seed on Monday evening.\nGeno Auriemma’s team enters the tournament with an unblemished 32-0 record. The Huskies have quality victories over the likes of Baylor, Notre Dame, Maryland, and South Carolina. That last win over the Gamecocks gave UConn its 100th straight victory. Last season, the Huskies made history by winning their fourth straight NCAA championship. A five-peat, given how this team has been playing all season, doesn’t look too out of reach.\nThe teams Bridgeport Region No. 1 Connecticut vs. No. 16 Albany\nNo. 8 Syracuse vs. No. 9 Iowa State\nNo. 5 Texas A&M vs. No. 12 Pennsylvania\nNo. 4 UCLA vs. No. 13 Boise State\nNo. 6 West Virginia vs. No. 11 Elon\nNo. 3 Maryland vs. No. 14 Bucknell\nNo. 7 Temple vs. No. 10 Oregon \nNo. 2 Duke vs. No. 15 Hampton\nStockton Region No. 1 South Carolina vs. No. 16 UNC Asheville\nNo. 8 Arizona State vs. No. 9 Michigan State\nNo. 5 Marquette vs. No. 12 Quinnipiac\nNo. 4 Miami vs. No. 13 Florida Gulf Coast\nNo. 6 Missouri vs. No. 11 South Florida \nNo. 3 Florida State vs. No. 14 Western Illinois\nNo. 7 Creighton vs. No. 10 Toledo\nNo. 2 Oregon State vs. No. 15 Long Beach State\nThe format The NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship, is a 64-team, single-elimination tournament that is similar to the men's NCAA Tournament, but there are some key differences. The biggest one is that the women's tournament plays its first two rounds at campus sites, with teams seeded No. 4 or higher hosting subregional pods. \nFrom there, teams move on to regionals that are named after their cities, not regions — with the cities chosen often significantly smaller and closer to epicenters of women's basketball fans than ones used for the men's NCAA Tournament. This year's Final Four will take place at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. The national semifinal games are set for Friday, March 31, and the national championship to be decided April 2.
