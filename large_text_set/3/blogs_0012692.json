My ex boyfriends mom made it happen when I moved in with them. I later found out things going on behind my back in the relationship that made up fall apart. My ex is claiming ownership over the dog he has no interest in. He bought him one bag of food, and a dog bed Link rarely uses cause he sleeps in bed with me. I take care of Link. I brush him. I potty trained him. I command him, and he listens to me over my ex. I pay for all his vet bills, he's never helped with that once. I make sure he has everything he needs. I take him to get groomed. I take him on hikes. I trained him to stay by my side off leash on nature trails. Link is my dog, and always has been. Please help me take my dog back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T05:16:36.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
