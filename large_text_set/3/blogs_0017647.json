Afinidad-Bernardo  31am Kylie Padilla as Amihan (left); Arra San Agustin as Amihan's reincarnation, Ariana. GMA/Released \nMANILA, Philippines — Kylie Padilla misses her job, particularly, playing Amihan in hit GMA fantasy series, “Encantadia.” \n“Oo, na-mi-miss ko! Parati naman, ‘di naman nawala!” she admitted in an interview with the press last week, following her launch as new ambassador for personal care store chain Watsons Philippines. \nAccording to the actress, who left “Encantadia” due to her pregnancy with her firstborn with boyfriend Aljur Abrenica, she still follows the show. \n“S’yempre gusto kong malaman kung anong nangyari kay Amihan, sumanib s’ya kay Ariana. Nakaka-miss talaga! Parang feeling ko ‘di ko masyadong na-aapreciate n’ung time na ‘yun kasi I was in my first trimester, gusto ko na talaga magpahinga…Pero ngayon na nakapagpahinga na talaga ako, parang gusto kong bumalik!” \nWhen Kylie’s character, Amihan, died in the series, her “ivtre” or soul reincarnated as Ariana, now played by Kapuso actress Arra San Agustin. \n“They’re doing a good job with the story e…we’re seeing that they’re blending it pretty well. So, I’m happy na na-attach din sila kay Amihan,” Kylie enthused. She is all praises for Arra.   \n“Unang una, ang ganda n’ya at nakita ko ‘yung fight scenes n’ya, she’s doing really well,” Kylie said of her successor. \nArra is also learning Muay Thai, one of the martial arts Kylie has mastered. “I’m proud of her (Arra) for making all the effort. Nakita ko sila ni Ruru (Madrid), okay naman ‘yung chemistry nila, so I’m hapy for them!”Kylie said. \nAccording to Robin Padilla’s daughter, she might not be able to reprise her role in the series. \n\"I don’t know if I’ll be back. ‘Di na ko pwedeng Amihan!” she remarked while touching her growing belly. \n“Maraming nagsasabi na sayang daw, ang ganda na daw ng takbo tapos sinayang ko lang. Ang sabi ko, ‘It’s such a blessing to be a mother!’ I mean, if you’re just thinking about show business, okay fine. Pero for a woman, to have a baby in her stomach at makikita n’yang lumaki…Sobrang nagagalit ako sa sayang, sayang na ‘yan. So shallow!” \nShe stressed that she never had the urge to hide her pregnancy. “No! I wanted to say it to the world! Ang hirap magtago e. ‘Yung mga ganyan ang cause ng cancer! ‘Yung mga secret secret na ganyan tapos ma-strestress ka pa. That was never my approach in life. I just wanted to be honest.” \nAccording to her, her fans, the “Encantadia” cast and crew and GMA have been very supportive of her pregnancy. \n“It was more on the bashers na mainit na ‘yung dugo sa’kin tapos nakahanap ng paraan para mang-ano pa…May mga tao lang talaga na nakikita ‘yung negative whatever you do…Maybe they’re not happy!” \nNow, whenever she reads bashes, she just shrugs them off. \n“When I read it, natatawa na lang ako…It’s a learning journey. Noong una, sinasabi ko sa sarili ko na ‘Wag ka magpaapekto,’ tapos iiyak na ‘ko. Ngayon, natatawa na lang ako.” \nHer showbiz career, she said, has been “up and down,” but she does not regret having a baby at the peak of her popularity. \n“In a good way, I will be more responsible with my choices and will have more love. Ang priority ko na ngayon is not just to be famous or to have money. It’s my baby,” she shared.
