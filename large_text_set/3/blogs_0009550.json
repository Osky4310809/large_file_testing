Mar 8, 2017 4:50 PM \nWe will miss you Mike… you are a class act. Much luck up north. gadzod says: Mar 8, 2017 4:50 PM \nIt’s obvious. Everybody outside of Buffalo that doesn’t watch their games think Tyrod is a good QB because of his low INT numbers, while discounting being dead last in passing. They get fullbacks because if they don’t, McCoy can’t run against a stacked box every play, meaning no yards will be produced. Watkins is an All-Pro WR, but Tyrod can’t get him the ball… Mar 8, 2017 4:51 PM \nMcCoy, Gillislee, the rookie RB from last years draft, 2 fullbacks? Seems crowded…???? wizwix says: Mar 8, 2017 4:52 PM \nSweet. Bills are going to field a rugby team. Which makes sense since you gotta try something different to get into the playoffs… Everything else has been done, right?? 60ftlesbianoctopus says: Mar 8, 2017 4:57 PM \nBills had like 8 no name receivers on roster last season. I’d rather have big name fullbacks than no name receivers who couldn’t catch a cold. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
