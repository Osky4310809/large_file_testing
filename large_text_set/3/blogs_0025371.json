These serious words on my arm to reassure me, I know that if I need something, help, I can pray. \n“I have prayed in the middle of a match. Sometimes, when things aren’t going as well as you would like, you ask the help of Jesus. \n\"That helps me concentrate again. To focus on what is important. Speaking to him allows me to clear my head. It only lasts a few seconds but it enables me to get rid of my frustration.” But the Frenchman has suffered a largely frustrating season at Arsenal (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Giroud is fighting for his place for club and country (Photo: REUTERS) \nGiroud has suffered a difficult season with Arsenal after losing his regular starting place under Arsene Wenger. \n“For me, the most difficult moment was that after scoring an important goal against Manchester United, I thought that I had scored some points and that I would start against PSG but no,” he told L’Equipe Magazine. \n“So I asked to speak to the coach to understand. I accept his decisions but I tell him what I think, without being negative, without antagonising. There are no misunderstandings between us.” \nArsenal have lost four of their last five Premier League games and risk missing out on Champions League qualification for the first time under Wenger.

The coach regularly tells us to ignore what is going on around us and to let him to deal with the critics. ‘Play, I will deal with the rest’.” \nAfter his brace against Luxembourg, Giroud said: “Whatever people say about me, I focus on the pitch and working with humiliity. \nFrance keeper Hugo Lloris said: “It is really good for Olivier – he needed it. He showed that he is still part of les Bleus.” poll loading Is Olivier Giroud worthy of a new contract at Arsenal? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:40:24.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
