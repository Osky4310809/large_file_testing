There’s an homage to Mass Effect 2’s system while you’re planetside in a dune buggy, but having to land on a planet and drive in circles on a hill to make a graph vibrate isn’t nearly as satisfying. \nTravel time is already a huge issue in Andromeda. Just moving between planets and getting into orbit can take a good 15 seconds (depending on how far your destination is) as a first-person animation from the perspective of the Tempest plays out. The ship slowly turns away from your origin and towards your destination, then lazily floats from one planet to the next. When you’re just trying to get some damn resources, it feels like quite the crawl. \nThe trip perspective is already abstract—the scale of Mass Effect’s universe isn’t so small that planets are a short floaty drive’s distance from one another. We know Ryder is looking at a map UI. It’s OK to treat it like one. Take the wheel \nMass Effect 2 and 3’s galaxy maps were fun to explore even though you weren’t in direct control of a ship rendered with the same detail as a ship in Elite. Instead, you moved a tiny model of the Normandy between planets and systems with direct control. However small, it gives off the impression you’re piloting the thing. Planets without many minerals weren’t a bust because you drove there and could putter out in a jiffy. No big deal. \nThe previous Mass Effect games knew that a little fear and uncertainty were important in underlining the adventure of space travel. \nDirect control also gave off an impression of the scale of the universe without making planet selection feel like clicking a cell on a spreadsheet. Andromeda attempts to go further, fully rendering every solar system to the point where you can exit the map and look out the Tempest’s windows at each duskish orb, but revokes direct control. The tradeoff isn’t worth it. Each system also needs to load in, which is presumably why the trips are unskippable. If I’m in the mood for romantic space sightseeing, I’ll grab my leather bound Moleskin and watch the planets go by, but over the course of dozens of hours I think I’ll run out of poetry. \nIn Mass Effect 2, trips required fuel. Every long journey to another galaxy felt dangerous. Mass Effect 3 even had itty-bitty reapers chase you between them. Space travel is scary, and the previous Mass Effect games knew that a little fear and uncertainty were important in underlining the adventure of space travel. Looking out of the Tempest’s windows at big glassy spheres doesn’t do much for me because getting to them is just a matter of pressing a button and waiting. There’s zero risk involved. What if Indiana Jones knew he couldn’t die? \nSource: ReptilicusFinch on YouTube \nWithout feeling threatened by traveling in Andromeda's galaxies, looking at them only made me marvel at texture work—not what they might be hiding or what kind of creatures live there, or whether I’d be able to make it home safely. And with no control, even over a tiny Tempest, space exploration is reduced to indulgent crane shots through space. My suspension of disbelief doesn’t start and end with sparkly shapes set against NASA’s astronomy picture of the day . \nIf we have to sit through each trip, make the small rewards feel bigger than they are. Be like Blizzard and shoot shiny letters into my eyes if I so much as imagine a planet. Even if I’m getting something worthless, I want to feel like I won the Super Bowl. Slather that rusty car in shiny paint. Make me feel anything, please. \nMaybe the planet scanning system improves further into the game, but it’s an awful first impression. Mass Effect is supposed to make me feel like a space adventurer, but with such a tedious, impotent interpretation of space exploration, I feel more like a space butler, tidying up planets over a long and tiresome workday.
