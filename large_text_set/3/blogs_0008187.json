This is one event I didn't want to skip. Arnold has meant so much to me and my family; I thought of him as a close friend, and Sam and Charlie were both born in the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies. He will be greatly missed and can never truly be replaced.\" \nFollowing an 16-month injury layoff after multiple back surgeries, Woods returned to competition at his own Hero World Challenge in December. He entered 2017 announcing his intent to play four events in five weeks, but made it just three rounds, missing the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open and withdrawing from the Dubai Desert Classic with back spasms. \nWoods then missed both the Genesis Open and Honda Classic - his next planned starts - and cancelled a planned press conference at Genesis after his doctors advised him to \"limit all activities.\" \nWith the Masters just one month away, Woods is offering no update on a potential return. \n\"Presently, I have no timetable for my return to golf, but my treatments are continuing and going well,\" he said.
