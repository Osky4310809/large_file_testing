You can also set recording options for video clips, navigate to the Xbox Store or your game library, or your Xbox Home.\nThat last option - a link to Xbox Home - is important because the new Xbox Guide will pop out of the right-side of the screen with a single button press, as opposed to the quick double-tap you have to perform now.\nCurrently a single button press takes you directly to Xbox Home. This will no longer be the case.\nIt's an interesting change in philosophy for Microsoft. When Xbox One launched, it did so without a Guide - much to the chagrin of Xbox 360 fans. Your Home screen as a whole was intended as its replacement.\nBut, over the years, the Guide has returned and slowly been filled with more and more functionality.\nOne final change in the next Xbox update will be integration of streaming via Beam - the service Ybarra was using last night when he showed off the Guide after a request from fans.
