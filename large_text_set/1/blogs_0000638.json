The judge offered him an opportunity to speak and he said nothing. \nHe was sentenced to two consecutive life terms with no chance of parole. \nNo other family members were present for the sentencing. \nHarris’ attorney told the court his biological father just had knee surgery and could not make it. \nThe assistant district attorney told the court Harris’ sister felt it would be too upsetting to be present and she will never be able to get over what he did. \nIn September, Harris was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of abuse of a corpse. \nIt took the jury, which was made up of six men and six women, about two hours to reach their decision. \nHarris did not testify during his trial and showed no emotion when the jury announced their verdict. \nIn December of 2014, Harris was arrested at a home on Suncrest Drive in Penn Hills. \nAccording to investigators, seven garbage cans were found in the basement with remains of Olivia and Lamar Gilbert inside. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter Julie Grant Julie Grant is thrilled be back in Pittsburgh and working for KDKA!
