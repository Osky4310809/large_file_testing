It’ll also have a sensory room with lava lamps and glowing stars.\n#beeston \nA post shared by The Milk Lounge (@themilklounge) on Mar 16, 2017 at 6:58am PDT \nAs well as offering a host of vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free goodies for hungry parents, the cafe will also be offering a daily programme of activities including baby massage, baby ballet and mother and baby pilates.\nFor those struggling with feeding, professional breastfeeding support will also be on offer .\nWhether it’s advising on attachment and positioning, or simply offering a listening ear, the cafe will have fully trained breastfeeding peer supporters on hand to help mums out.\nAnd if this sounds up your street and you’re currently looking for a job, Milk Lounge is currently recruiting staff.
