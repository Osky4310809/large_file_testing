There was some definite surprise that Trump had won — and many young, politically engaged students were shocked. \nTwo months later, Trump has an approval rating hovering around 40 percent , making him the least popular president-elect in modern history . \nWith that in mind, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that there are several protests being planned — the Women’s March on Washington being the most high-profile . \nBut the Women’s March is far from the only protest. And, with millennials having overwhelmingly rejected Trump at the ballot box, there are plenty of protests, actions and rallies being planned by — or at least heavily recruiting — college students in Washington, D.C., and around the country on inauguration day. \nOne of the bigger movements gearing up to take on D.C. is Occupy Inauguration . The group is planning a rally at 9:30 a.m. Jan. 20, starting at Malcolm X Park in D.C. and marching to McPherson Square, just north of the White House. \nJill Stein, the 2016 Green Party nominee for president, is listed as a confirmed speaker. A photo posted by Green Party US (@greenpartyus) on Jan 17, 2017 at 6:08am PST \nDavid Cobb, a member of the steering committee for Occupy Inauguration and a former Green Party nominee for president, told USA TODAY College in an email that he’s been encouraged by “the breadth and depth” of the response to Trump “before he has even taken office.” The organization has a list of demands , including rejecting the Dakota Access Pipeline , a $15 minimum wage, an end to mass surveillance and free college education. \nAlso in D.C., Generation Progress Action, a millennial interest group, is working with the College Democrats of George Washington University to lead a “resistance training” in order to “equip all attendees with the skills and resources necessary to effectively fight back in the broadest sense of the term,” spokesman Kyle Epstein told USA TODAY College. \n“Our generation was the only one to have rejected Donald Trump at the ballot box,” Epstein said. “Resisting Trump and his agenda is very much a flash point. We want to take all that energy and kind of reroute it into something that is actionable.” \nThe “boot camp” will include opening and closing plenaries at 12:30 p.m. and 5:15 p.m., both at the Lisner Auditorium at George Washington University. In between, attendees will get training on issues like healthcare and student debt, and on practical skills, like how to lobby an elected official, how to engage with the press and even how to run for office.

For those who are stuck on campus but want to protest on Friday, there are walkouts planned on campuses across the country. man i might be on campus tomorrow when the walkout happens pic.twitter.com/XPHBgIXvzI \n— sleeps @ ALA ✨ (@ARAKlTAS) January 19, 2017 Umich is a joke if they think a class walkout will change anything about an election outcome. Trump got the W fair and square, accept it🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/PeUSTuoOyX \nSome of the walkouts are being organized by Young Progressives Demanding Action . \n“The purpose isn’t the action of walking out — the purpose is the action of going forward,” YPDA’s national director, Ian Schiffer, told USA TODAY College. \nSchiffer, 22 and a senior at Pomona College, said that YPDA formed out of College Students for Bernie . And now, he said, the idea is to keep people engaged and educated. \n“Organizing’s not easy. You need some tools and political organization to get there,” he said. \nKenneth Shelton, 20 and a junior at St. John’s University in Queens, N.Y., is a head organizer for Black Lives Matter in Greater New York. On Friday, he said, there will be walkouts at different campuses across the city that will meet up at some sort of protest. \n“I think it’s important, that day, to talk about the issues,” Shelton he told USA TODAY College. “It’s less about Trump and more about the issues that people care about.” \nShelton said the issues are important, not just the president, because he’ll have a cabinet and plenty of other government appointees and employees in the federal bureaucracy. \n“It’s about his whole administration and the people he puts in power,” Shelton said. “If we just focus on Trump, we’re not going to get anywhere.” \nAnd in California, Hanna Burge, an organizer with Socialist Students UCLA, said she expects over 1,000 people to turn out for a rally against the incoming administration. The walkout at UCLA will be a part of a national movement of walkouts that includes 11 cities in nine states. Burge graduated in 2015 from UCLA. \nBurge told USA TODAY College that the protests and walkouts matter to show that activists around the country aren’t “going to sit back and let [Trump] and his administration impose divisive legislative assaults.” \n“He is vulnerable. He’s the least popular president to ever take office,” Burge said. \nSSUCLA has a a list of demands , including — like Occupy Inauguration’s and other groups’— free college tuition and debt cancelation. \n“Youth and students have always been at the forefront of movements,” Burge said. So, if they can set an example at the University of California system, the movement could gain credibility and spread nationwide.” \nShelton agreed. Millennials, he said, have a clear political future. \n“Millennials are now the biggest political bloc in the country. We’re going to be running for office, we’re going to be voting in these elections. We’re a big voting bloc when it comes to voting in presidential elections,” Shelton said. “I think this generation is really the generation that’s going to create something big, and that always starts on college campuses.” Cody Boteler is a Towson University student and a USA TODAY College correspondent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:37:49.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
