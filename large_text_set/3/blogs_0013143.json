Curious about the man, Sprouse began visiting Hubbard on her lunch break and discovered that the corner was the last place he had seen his mother over three years ago. He remained there waiting for her to return. \nIn an interview with MyBayArea Radio, Sprouse described the genesis of their friendship . \"I began to get more and more concerned as I knew winter was coming and I thought, 'So what's going to happen now?' So he and I started talking about maybe how would he feel about sometimes coming to my house to get out of the bad weather, and that's how we started.\" \nShe started a Facebook page called This Is Victor to introduce him by name to the community surrounding him: a way of destigmatizing him and reminding others that he too, has a story. \nAccording to KHOU, his Facebook page eventually attracted the attention of Hubbard's uncle who helped him reunite with his mother earlier this month. \"I got to talk to her and I really feel like I accomplished something, \" Hubbard said. \nSprouse has also raised over $18,000 for him in a GoFundMe campaign. \nWatch Project Dad, a television series about fatherhood and family:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T02:59:14.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
