The Court of Appeal said the director used the wrong process to come to that decision. \nREAD MORE: CAA must review safety areas at Wellington Airport, Court of Appeal rules \nWhen the decision was released Wellington Airport chief executive Steve Sanderson said he believed the resource consent hearings could go ahead as planned. \nBut on Tuesday lawyers for the airport formally asked for the process to be adjourned as it seeks leave to take the challenge to the Supreme Court. \nA memorandum to the court said the airport \"formally seeks to adjourn these proceedings until that appeal is heard and determined by the Supreme Court...[or] until the Director of Civil Aviation has reconsidered whether the RESA length provided as part of the runway extension is acceptable.\" \nThe airport insisted it was committed to the project, but the hearings should be adjourned because its application may be amended, including the possibility that it applies for a longer runway. \nThe memorandum also raised the possibility that the project could be \"abandoned\". \n\"In these circumstances the court and the parties would be put to unnecessary cost and inconvenience unless an adjournment is granted.\" \nWellington Airport has been approached for comment. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:32:12.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
