February 13, 2017 2:12 PM By Bob Allen \nDONEGAL (KDKA) — Police in Washington County care investigating a bizarre situation. \nA farmer in Donegal recently discovered at least five tombstones in a ravine near Shaler Road. \n“I noticed that stone so I got out and took some pictures of it, told my friends about it,” Shane Moore said. \nMoore said he uses the road every day and noticed the tombstones mixed in with several slabs of concrete. One of them reads: G. Duffield Marshall, 1860 to 1896. \n“Doesn’t seem right does it? I hope the stones get back to their rightful owner,” he said. \nThe tombstones were partially buried by dirt and stone but recent heavy rains made them more visible. \n“It was dumped, it wasn’t like somebody picked it up and threw it in this strategic place,” said resident Darrin Iams. \nIams and others want to know how long the tombstones have been here, who dumped them and why. \nDonegal police are investigating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:08:18.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
