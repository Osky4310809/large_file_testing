After all, a lot of hard work goes in to make the occasion a success. And like every other bride, we all fantasize that it will be the dreamiest time of our life. Reality check: while it is one of the biggest occasions of your life, it will not be a smooth ride. Even though you have a wedding planner and everything is sorted you might run into problems on your D-day. Don't get baffled, some awkward situations might take place and these are out of your control. Here's how to do damage control. Wedding lehenga mishap \nWe know that walking in the wedding lehenga is a big pain, no matter how beautiful it looks. For all you know, while you are walking you might end up causing a tear in your lehenga. But, don't lose your marbles. Your friends and your sisters will come to your rescue and save the day. So, just breathe and smile. Vendor hiccup \nWhen you're dealing with various vendors for your wedding, there's a chance one of them could mess up. Like, your flower decoration might not be up on time, or the appetizers from the caterer could come in late. The last thing you want to do is panic. Calm your nerves and make sure someone is contacting the vendor to fix the problem. Often, you'll be provided with an emergency contact, in case something goes wrong. Let your family or wedding planner handle the situation. Guest tantrums \nIndian weddings are known to have a lot of guests. It's impossible to please everyone, when you have over five hundred people attending your do. And given the temperamental nature of most relatives, someone might get upset because the food was cold or because your mother forgot to greet them in a hurry. Just chill on that front. You can't make everyone happy, and that is fine. Troublemakers \nWhenever there's a large gathering of people, there're bound to be troublemakers. Especially, when there's alcohol. Loud arguments or even an all out brawl is not unimaginable. Most venues have security, so let them handle the situation as there really isn't anything you can do. Wedding day fight with your significant other \nSome couples could get into a heated argument on, or just before their wedding day. Maybe, the night before both of you were tired and got into a heated discussion, or the baraat came late and that ended up pissing you off. But, don't hold it against each other. After all, it is a very important occasion for the two of you. So, let it slide and spread joy. Your aunt giving you sex talk \nSo, maybe after downing a couple of drinks (or maybe not) your cool aunt might come to you, have a discussion with you on what to expect on your suhaagraat. Don't start acting weird. Discreetly inform your mother to steer her away from you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:22:12.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
