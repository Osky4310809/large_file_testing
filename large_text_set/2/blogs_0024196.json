names. When the Hollywood system started, people commonly took simplified versions of their names to make them easier for people to say. Doris Day is much simpler than “Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff” and Clayton Holmes Grissom picked “Clay Aiken” when signing up for American Idol — because it was just more memorable. Or if you’re Albert Brooks, there’s no fucking possible way you can use your real name — because…well, you’ll see. \nHere are 55 people whose real names might surprise you. 1. Katy Perry \nReal Name: Katy Hudson \nThe singer changed her name to avoid confusion with that other Hudson she shares a name with: Kate Hudson. 2. Demi Moore \nHer exes were born as “Walter Willis” and “Christopher Kutcher.” 3. Albert Brooks \nThe reason for the name change should be pretty obvious. 4. Meg Ryan \nReal Name: Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra \nIs it just me or is her real name close to being a Fiona Apple album title? 5. Natalie Wood \nReal Name: Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko \nBorn to Russian immigration parents, the young actress changed it to blend into the Hollywood times, like the Swedish Greta Lovisa Gustafsson, better known as Greta Garbo. 6. Woody Allen \nCome to think of it, Allen doesn’t sound very Jewish, does it? 7. Louis C.K. \nReal Name: Louis Szekely \nLouis C.K.’s stage name is barely such. It’s just an easier way to say his actual last name, which is pronounced “See-kay.” 8. Joaquin Phoenix \nReal Name: Joaquin Rafael Bottom \nIf he were gay, that last name would be perfection. 9. Garrison Keillor \nReal Name: Gary Edward Keillor \nSee? Even NPR personalities use stage names. 10. Chevy Chase \nReal Name: Cornelius Crane Chase \nThe actor got his name from the traditional English song “The Ballad of Chevy Chase,” which (unfortunately) was not about an old racist who is difficult to work with and derails brilliant shows. 11. Tina Fey \nReal Name: Elizabeth Stamatina Fey \nLike her 30 Rock character, Tina Fey’s real first name is “Liz.” 12. Ben Kingsley \nReal Name: Krishna Pandit Bhanji \nLike Barack Obama, Kingsley was born to a white mother and Kenyan father — of Indian Muslim descent. 13. Olivia Wilde \nReal Name: Olivia Jane Cockburn \nMy last name rhymes with another word for a penis, which made Middle School rough. Olivia Cockburn, I’m here for you, if ever you need to talk. 14. Alan Alda \nReal Name: Alphonso d’Abruzzo \nAlda’s last name was concocted by putting together the first two letters of his first and last name. AL + DA = Alda. 15. Portia De Rossi \nReal Name: Amanda Lee Rogers \nI guess she figured that “Portia de Rossi” had more zest to it than “Amanda Rogers.” She was probably right. 16. Diane Keaton \nIn real life, she shares a last name with her most famous character, Annie Hall. 17. Michael Caine \nMichael Caine named himself after Humphrey Bogart’s character in “The Caine Mutiny.” 18. Larry King \nReal Name: Lawrence Harvey Zeigler \nKing was born to an Austrian father and mother from Belarus, both of whom were Orthodox Jews living in New York in the 1930s. All of this sounds like the set up to a Woody Allen bit. 19. George Michael \nReal Name: Georgios Panayiotou \nHe should have just changed his name to “Glory Hole.” At least it’s truth in advertising. 20. Whoopi Goldberg \nReal Name: Caryn Johnson \nHer stage name was concocted from her ability to fart a lot. (If you’ve seen her 1 in 3 commercials, you know she’s made quite the weird career out of bodily functions.) Her mother advised her to take a Jewish last name, arguing that it would help her career if people thought she was Jewish. 21. Hulk Hogan \nReal Name: Terry Jean Bollette \nIf I wanted to scare someone, I’d tell them my name was Hulk, too. 22. Bea Arthur \nReal Name: Her co-star, Rue McClanahan, was born with the first name of “ Eddi-Rue.” 23. Rock Hudson \nReal Name: Leroy Harold Scherer, Jr. \nEither way, he was still ridiculously hot — and gigantic. He was “6’5,” which basically makes him a skyscraper. 24. Miranda July \nReal Name: Miranda Jennifer Grossinger \nI have nothing to say here, except that I love Miranda July, in all of her forms. Miranda Grossinger, I accept you. 25. Elvis Costello \nReal Name: Declan Patrick McManus \nWhat’s weird: He actually looks more like a Declan than an Elvis to me. 26. Joan Crawford \nReal Name: Lucille LeSueur \nIt makes a lot of sense that she and Lucille Bluth would have the same first name, because they’re basically the same person. 27. Kirk Douglas \nReal Name: Issur Danielovitch Demsky \nI really like his actual name. There’s something appropriately commanding about a man named “Issur Demsky.” 28. Carmen Electra \nReal Name: Tara Patrick \nC’mon. There’s no way you thought anyone’s last name was “Electra,” unless that person is in a Sophocles play. 29. Audrey Hepburn \nReal Name: Edda Kathleen van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston \nSay that one five times fast. 30. Judy Garland \nReal Name: Frances Gumm \nHowever, Liza’s name is all hers. Her father was Vincente Minnelli, the classic musical director who worked with Judy in Meet Me in St. Louis . 31. Truman Capote \nReal Name: Truman Streckfus Persons \nStreckfus. Just…Streckfus. 32. Julia Child \nReal Name: Julia Carolyn McWilliams \n“Child” is actually her married name, so this one’s a bit of a cheat, but it’s odd to me thinking of Julia Child with any other name. She just is Julia Child. 33. Dido \nReal Name: Florian Cloud de Bounevialle Armstrong \nI almost wish that she had used that as her stage name, just to see that whole thing on a concert poster or an album cover. “Stan” by Eminem ft. Florian Cloud de Bounevialle Armstrong takes it to a whole other level. 34. Elvira \nReal Name: Cassandra Peterson \nDid you know she was in a Bond movie and posed for a Tom Waits album? The woman has not had a boring career, that’s for sure. 35. Martin Sheen \nReal Name: Ramon Antonio Gerard Estevez \nThat makes Charlie Sheen’s real name “Carlos Estevez,” as witnessed in the Machete Kills trailer. 36. Courtney Love \nReal Name: Love Michelle Harrison \nYou can change the name, but you can’t change the cray. 37. Fred Astaire \nHis famous dance partner, Ginger Rogers, was born Virginia Katherine McMath 38. Tea Leoni \nReal Name : Elizabeth Tea Pantaleoni \nEvery time I see her real last name, I just think of the word “pantalones.” 39. Bruno Mars \nReal Name: Peter Gene Hernandez \nTrivia question: What is Bruno Mars’ ethnicity? He’s like the racial spam of people — a little bit of everything. He is Filipino, Spanish, Puerto Rican, Hungarian and Ukranian, is Jewish and was born in Hawaii. 40. Gene Simmons \nReal Name: Chaim Witz \nHalf of the original members of KISS were Jewish. If I could ever get Gene Simmons to play “Werewolf Bar Mitzvah,” I would die a happy human. 41. Helen Mirren \nReal Name: Ilyena Lydia Vasilievna Mironov \nIlyena Mironov would be a great spy name. 42. Shania Twain \nReal Name: Eileen Regina Edwards \nTwain is her stepfather’s last name. 43. Anne Rice \nReal Name: Howard Allen O’Brien \nI also like “Howard O’Brien” better. It has a nice George Eliot thing going on, although Anne Rice is no George Eliot. 44. Julianne Moore \nJulianne is a portmanteau of her first name and her middle name, Anne. 45. Kim Cattrall \nReal Name : Clare Woodgate \nShe was born in Liverpool, hence the name, but as evidenced by The Ghost Writer , she can’t do a convincing British accent anyway. Much like Madonna. 46.
