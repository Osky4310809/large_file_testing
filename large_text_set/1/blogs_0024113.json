Rossen, who is behind the successful What Would You Do? franchise will now oversee all unscripted TV shows. \nMorgan Hertzan , svp of Disney/ABC TV says Rossen “has worked on some of the biggest interviews in television, including Barbara Walters ‘ exclusive with Monica Lewinsky and Diane Sawyer ’s legendary interview with Whitney Houston . \nIn a 2015 interview Rossen told us about her life in TV news: “I lived and breathed this place for the first 10 years of my career. I rarely left. As my friends were all having kids, I was sitting in an edit room at 2 a.m. At the time I thought they were the ‘boring’ ones. Later in life, I was lucky enough to experience motherhood myself, and learned to balance work and family. But I am not going to lie; it is very hard to be a good wife, mother, and executive producer. Most days I can balance two out of the three. Some days, I truly only master one. But I still live and breathe this place.” \nRossen, who is married to NBC News correspondent Jeff Rossen , joined ABC News in 1997 as a production coordinator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:57:04.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
