Remke Markets Inc., the longtime Northern Kentucky and Ohio grocer, has been sold to a Findlay-based company. Remke’s 10 stores in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky will remain open and operating as Remke but will be under the management of Fresh Encounter Inc., which operates four other grocery chains. Enlarge Remke Markets have been sold. According to a letter sent to Remke shoppers, Fresh Encounter will manage Remke Markets on behalf of Generative Growth LLC, a privately held company based in Findlay. The members of Generative Growth include experienced third-generation grocers Michael Needler Jr. and Julie Needler Anderson . Pat Iasillo , director of customer relationship marketing for Remke Markets, said the acquisition will help the formerly family-owned chain. “We will have a lot more resources and buying power,” Iasillo said. He’s anticipating no changes at the stores as a result of the transaction, the terms of which were not disclosed. “The purchasers are a family-owned business like we are, they have the same king of culture,” Iasillo said. Fresh Encounter has a family of independent grocery stores including Sack ‘n Save, Community Markets, Great Scot and Chief Markets. In a letter to customers, Remke president Matthew Remke wrote that the decision to sell Remke Markets \"was a difficult one.\" “This change will allow us to continue to deliver on our promise of a local, neighborhood grocery with exceptional service in convenient locations, as well as to preserve valuable employment for our dedicated associates,” Remke wrote. In addition, Remke wrote that his father, Bill Remke , will retire after 60 years of service. Remke Markets operates 10 stores in the region with about 800 total employees. In May 2016, the company announced it was closing its Pleasant Ridge location. Erlanger-based Remke is the 10th-largest locally based retailer in the region, according to Business Courier research. Demeropolis covers commercial real estate and development.
