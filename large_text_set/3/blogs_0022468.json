For present-day scientists, the fascination with the power of cold continues, with everything from a blast of icy water during a morning shower to walking topless in winter being studied as a possible quick-and-simple path to a healthier life.\nA new report from the Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands has linked global warming with a rise in type 2 diabetes, and numerous studies in the last few years have lent credence to the idea that artificial heat may be a contributing factor to obesity , as it has caused our metabolisms to slow down. The theory goes that of the two types of fat in the body (white and brown) brown fat burns calories, and there’s evidence to suggest that when you’re cold, brown fat is either produced, or activated . In our world of central heating and controlled environments, we simply aren’t cold often enough. So which of all the practical cooling tips may actually improve our health?\nIs it worth it? Cryotherapy Read more \nThe theory: open a window at night.\nDoes it work? Possibly. It’s easier to nod off in a cold environment than it is in a warm one, as a drop in core temperature signals that it’s time to go to sleep. It may also aid weight loss by increasing brown fat activity. The former Nasa scientist Ray Cronise, whose area of interest is cold exposure, has said he sleeps without a blanket, even during winter .\nThe theory : turn the central heating down.\nDoes it work? Again, if being colder stimulates brown fat, then it’s worth a try. There are also numerous arguments that our reliance on being warm is creating a “seasonless” existence , which we have not yet evolved into coping with, which is having a detrimental effect on our immune systems. Experts recommend keeping inside temperatures at between 12C and 18C, which has the added benefit of reducing our energy consumption.\nThe theory: have a cold shower in the morning.\nDoes it work? The myth that rinsing your hair with cold water makes it shinier is enduring, even though it may not have much basis in fact. However, various studies have shown the health benefits of a cold shower in the morning . These include reduced stress, weight loss, and even increased productivity, as doing it is hard, and doing hard things first thing may make you procrastinate less.\nThe theory: go swimming outdoors.\nDoes it work? Outdoor swimming has exploded in popularity in the last few years , thanks to reports of its magical properties. The cold shock can boost the immune system , improve mental health by stimulating endorphins, dopamine and serotonin, and reduce uric acid , which means it’s easier to cope with stress.\nTopics Health & wellbeing Shortcuts features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:00:42.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
