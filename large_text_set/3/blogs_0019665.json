I’m not going to lose everything. I’m not going to leave my family in distress,’” Biden said.

He claimed the controversial plan has been “incredibly beneficial, not only by the way to individuals, but total health care cost in America.” \nBiden failed to mention that healthcare premiums for midlevel plans under the Affordable Care Act increased by an average of 25 percent in 2017 due to rising costs and insurance companies dropping out of the marketplace.
