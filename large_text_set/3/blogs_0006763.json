(Reuters) \nToday. Today, in the puddle and the day of the women, we choose not only to share their pictures on social media or but pour hearts out in memory of their sacrifice and love, signifying their importance, while our streets remain unsafe, as do our homes. We speak about women rights as we decide the rights to suit ourselves. Basically, same old shit, every year. In India, we have some bizarre ideas about women. Misconceptions, beyond repair, one might say. A few weeks ago, “Lipstick under my Burkha” was refused certification because it was “lady oriented” and spoke about their fantasies above life. For the uninitiated, yes, women do have sex. In fact, sexual relationships between a man and a WOMAN is the only kind allowed in this country. The other kind is a crime under Section 377. \nThere is also this minor flaw in the constitution that does not recognise marital rape. To quote the Union Minister for Women and Child Development, “The concept of marital rape as understood internationally cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context due to various factors like level of education/illiteracy, poverty, myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs [and the] mindset of the society to treat the marriage as a sacrament.” Now, I will try not to preach but a rape is a rape.According to the universal definition, a rape is a crime, committed by a man or woman, of forcing another person to have sexual intercourse with him without their consent and against their will. Ther are no social barriers or sanskars or education levels involved here. One word: Consent. \nThere are also these minor issues of separate curfew timings for girls in schools and colleges, separate pay scales for the same jobs, dress code and eating of fast foods and using of mobile phones. Oh and yeah, don’t talk to boys. Because hormonal imbalance. Duh. Maneka Gandhi came up with a gem about the curfews in hostels saying that when a girl is 16-17 years old, she has hormonal outbursts and a Laxman Rekha needs to be drawn for their own safety. Now, I am no psychiatrist, but I find symptoms of a ‘parent syndrome’ in Mrs Gandhi. And then there are issues of molestation, eve-teasing, being treated like second class citizens, slut-shaming, and showing women where they belong, and having laws about abortion made by a group of men, among other things. There is also a social stigma around menstruation. Yeah, black polybags, no kitchen, no temples, don’t touch etc. You get the gist. Also, there is a demand for virgin women as wives on Indian matrimonial ‘market’, because men will be men but women need to be pure. And just when you thought, I was done with the rant, here are a few gems from our beloved politicians: \nSatyadev Katare, Congress leader in MP: \nNo man would harass a woman till she eggs him to do so by looking at him in a suggestive manner \nMamata Banerjee , Chief Minister, West Bengal \n“Earlier if men and women would hold hands, they would get caught by parents and reprimanded but now everything is so open. It’s like an open market with open options. Rapes happen because men and women interact freely.” \nAbhijit Mukherjee, Congress MP, son of President Pranab Mukherjee(during ‘Nirbhaya’ protests): \n“I can see many beautiful women among the protestors; ‘highly dented-painted’, giving interviews. I have grave doubts whether they’re students because women of that age are generally not students.” \nAbu Azmi, Samajwadi Party: \n“I support the death penalty for the Delhi rapists but there should also be a law that women should not wear less clothes and roam around with boys who are not their relatives. What is the need for roaming at night with men who are not relatives? This should be stopped.” \nAsaram Bapu: \nNirbhaya should have chanted the name of God and told one of her rapists that she found him to be a brother. If she had done that she could have been saved. \nDharambir Goyat, Haryana Congress leader \nI don’t feel any hesitation in saying that 90 per cent of the girls want to have sex intentionally but they don’t know that they would be gang raped. \nNow, now, do not be shocked. even our much celebrated and socially advanced film industry portrays only three types of women: “The Unladylike”, “The Sanskrit” and “The party going booze drinkers”. Imagine dying someday, going to heaven and finding God to be a woman.
