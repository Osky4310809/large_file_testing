BuzzFeed News published a 35-page dossier compiled by an anonymous source contains a number of scathing, but unconfirmed allegations against the President-elect, but naturally, it was the alleged pee show that hogged all the headlines. \nTrump has vehemently denied the claims, taking to Twitter to say that “intelligence agencies should have never have allowed this fake news to ‘leak’ into the public,” which suggests the guy at least as a kernel of a sense of humor. But let’s forget about the political implications of these charges—which, again, are completely unverified—and focus on the real question: Just why on earth would anyone be turned on by golden showers?

Some men who are into water sports say that the act of sharing human waste, as disgusting as it might seem, creates a bond between two partners. The logic: If you’re comfortable enough to piss on each other, you *probably* have a close relationship. \nLast year, we asked sex researcher Debra W. Soh, a neuroscientist specializing in the fMRI of sexual kinks at York University in Toronto, to reveal some of the most extreme fetishes she’s seen among her male subjects. Kevin, a 20-something university student who told Soh he likes to urinate on his sex partners, said, “It’s like I’m sharing my love.” For some guys, the grosser or more taboo the act, the more sexually exciting it becomes. Other men told Soh that they’re turned on by the fact that it’s humiliating to be peed on. \nEven if water sports aren’t your thing, there’s a chance you may have an equally weird fetish. A 2016 study in the Journal of Sex Research finds that one in three people has experimented with paraphilias—unusual sexual interests—at some point in their lives.
