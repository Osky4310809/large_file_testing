Terms of the deal have yet to be disclosed. A former third-round pick, Wheaton spent the first four years of his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers as a tertiary pass-catching threat in one of the league's most talented receiving corps. The 26-year-old racked up 107 catches for 1,508 yards and eight touchdowns during his time in the Steel City, but his 2016 season was limited to three appearances because of a serious shoulder injury. Wheaton, who was placed on injured reserve in November, underwent surgery in January to repair his torn labrum. The expected timetable for recovery was pegged at three months, a ccording to ESPN.com's Jeremy Fowler . For the Bears, Wheaton should work into the mix as a No. 3 option behind Kevin White and Cameron Meredith for quarterback Mike Glennon, who agreed to a contract with the Bears on Thursday, per Rapoport . Wheaton is hardly an ideal replacement for Alshon Jeffery —who bolted for the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday, per Rapoport —but he is a worthwhile flier considering he posted encouraging numbers two seasons ago. In 2015, Wheaton stood out alongside Antonio Brown when he hauled in 44 receptions for 749 yards and five touchdowns while posting 17 yards per reception, which ranked ninth among all qualified players. If Wheaton can come close to replicating those numbers in an offense that's undergoing a major facelift, he could soon look like a solid bargain-bin addition.
