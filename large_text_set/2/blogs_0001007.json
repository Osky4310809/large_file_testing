In a letter to Parliament on Wednesday, Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk wrote that “no shadow can be allowed to hang over the result” of the March 15 election.

They hired security expert Sijmen Ruwhof to assess the security of the voting process handled by Ondersteunende Software Verkiezingen (OSV) that was introduced in 2009. \nOSV was used to transmit the results to the central election commission or the Electoral Council, after the Dutch have voted manually. Looking at potential security flaws, Ruwhof determined that “the average iPad is more secure than the Dutch voting system”. \nThe security expert argued that OSV, which can be installed on any computer using a CD-ROM, stands no chance against hackers if an older operating system is used on that device. For instance, hackers, via the internet, can easily penetrate Windows XP for which Microsoft has stopped issuing security updates in 2014. \nFurthermore, the use of unencrypted USB sticks to store votes also opens OSV to manipulation. If a malware is installed – via the Internet or unsecured USB flash drive – it may change the voting results in the OSV software, the expert warned.

It’s just very stupid when working at polling stations with obsolete computers,” the MP said, local media reported . \nFollowing Wednesday’s decision to manually count the votes, Opposition party D66 asked why the government decided to safeguard the electoral process just six weeks before the election, and why the minister was so “naive” last week when he said “ the elections would be safe and that there were no measures required.” \nDutch media also pointed out that Plaster said last week there are no indications that other countries tried to influence Dutch elections in the recent past. Furthermore, local reports note, that Electoral Council knew of problems with the counting software since 2011, and only now decided to act. \nSome 12.6 million Dutch voters are eligible to cast ballots on March 15 to elect new members of the 150-seat lower house of parliament. Some 31 parties have so far registered applications to field candidates. The election committee will rule on Friday how many parties will be allowed to contest the vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:13:05.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
