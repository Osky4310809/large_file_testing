Kofi Outlaw Back to Article Image of \nLogan is officially a big hit for Fox and the X-Men movie universe - and an epic final swan song for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, as well as Patrick Stewart's Professor Charles Xavier. Now that Wolverine 3 is in theaters, fans are starting to look beyond the film to the process of making it, and all that could've been. \nWe've recently heard how that powerful ending was filmed , why certain events weren't shown , and all the Easter eggs there are to spot. Now, some Logan concept art reveals another detail that may have once been intended for the film. Check out all of the new Logan concept art in our Gallery Above! \nAs you can see in the photos, it looks like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was (at least at one point) going to have a canine companion! The artwork is that of Shae Shatz , who has a list of credits doing concept work for various movie, car, and gaming companies. It's gorgeous work, but some of the concepts (like the dog) may have been abandoned with good reason. \nFirst of all, the whole Logan with a dog angle would've been too close to films like Riddick or John Wick . It's been done a bit too much, recently (softening the tough guy killer with a puppy). The overall color scheme also looks too bright for the washed-out and rusted world that Mangold ultimately created onscreen, and the dam set piece (is that Alkali Lake?) wasn't really featured in the movie. \nStill, as fans continue to absorb and reflect on Logan , this is all interesting to see and discuss, no?

But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces. \nLogan is directed by James Mangold, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Frank and Michael Green, from a story by Mangold, and also stars Patrick Stewart, Richard E. Grant, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant and Dafne Keen. \nLogan is now playing in theaters. \nMore Logan :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:14:48.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
