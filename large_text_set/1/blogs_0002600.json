They are, after all, unexpected essentials.\nAn innovative form of \"craftivism\" is going viral in the final weeks leading up to the Jan. 21 march in protest of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. The aim? Outfit every single one of the projected 200,000 protesters at the Women's March on Washington in pink \"pussyhats.\" \nSEE ALSO: 'P*ssy grabbing' threats are now a thing in Trump's America \nThe Pussyhat Project ‚Äî a clear reference to Trump's infamous \" grab her by the pussy \" comment ‚Äî provides simple patterns to guide march attendees and supporters in knitting , crocheting or sewing bright pink \"pussyhats.\" The result is a simple hat with two peaks on top, resembling cat ears.\nMe-yow to @nerdiyogi, her friend, and her #pussyhat! üíñ \nA photo posted by Pussyhat Project (@p_ssyhatproject) on Dec 20, 2016 at 7:30am PST \nThe effort, launched in late November by activists Krista Suh and Jayna Zweiman, is a way to visually unite attendees of the march, according to the organizers. Yet, the hats also serve as a stark reminder of why women will gather on Washington for the march: To defend equal rights and protest their freshly minted president's undeniable sexism .\nThe project ‚Äî and the hats ‚Äî are just the latest example of women reclaiming the term \"pussy\" in the aftermath of Trump's leaked comments. Phrases using the derogatory term, including \" pussy grabs back ,\" have been a source of empowerment for some women in the aftermath of Trump's election.\nAnother pussyhat! #pussyhatproject #womensmarchonwashington @p_ssyhatproject \nA photo posted by Arlyn Bantog-VanDooyeweert (@ar_pnutgallery) on Jan 6, 2017 at 10:36pm PST \nSuh and Zweiman tell The Huffington Post that they have no exact estimate of the number of hats created so far, but guess anywhere between 30,000 to 100,0000 have been crafted. More than 60,000 people have clicked on the ‚ÄúPatterns‚Äù section of the Pussyhat Project website.\nThe co-organizers say they have heard from women around the country who say crafting the hats has been a helpful way to work through election-related anger and grief. \nFirst hat done!

The co-organizers are also encouraging crafters attending the march to make and distribute their own hats to help outfit the crowd. \nspending today makin cute lil hats for the kickass women who are going to the women's march on Washington üíï‚ú®üå∏üòΩüéÄ #pussyhatproject \nA photo posted by ell (@ellensims) on Jan 6, 2017 at 2:11pm PST \nAn essential component of the project, according to Suh and Zweiman, is to allow people who cannot make it to Washington D.C. to show their support and solidarity from afar. The co-organizers hope supporters around the nation will wear pink hats on Jan. 21 to stand up for equality and women's rights.\nAccording to The Huffington Post, Suh and Zweiman's main hope for the viral project is to make the momentum last.\n‚ÄúWe hope,\" Suh said, \"these hats will become a symbol long after the march.\"\nBONUS: Watch this little girl bravely share her truth at an anti-Trump rally", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:58:55.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
