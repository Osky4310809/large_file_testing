At least they had Schmeichel and Vardy to save them. Danny Drinkwater found space down the left, released by a pass from substitute Demarai Gray, and set up Vardy to crash home from close range. \nIt was an away goal that leaves this tie wide open. It may yet regenerate Vardy, and Leicester's season with it. \n2. Leicester ride their luck \nFor 70 minutes, this was the Leicester of the Premier League, not the Champions League version that had temporarily drawn a veil over their domestic slide. \nThe starting selection of Ahmed Musa ahead of Gray was surprising, considering the pair's performances during Saturday's 1-0 FA Cup defeat at League One Millwall. Leicester's fade owes no small part to Claudio Ranieri's inability to find a settled team, as was the bedrock of their title campaign. \nMusa and January addition Wilfred Ndidi in midfield were the only two new players from last season, reflecting the failures in recruitment that are another contributor to the crash. Ranieri is instead left hoping that Vardy and Riyad Mahrez can somehow play themselves back into form, when there had been little sign of that for months now. \nWhile Mahrez was again pretty quiet, at least Vardy finally came to life, though both he and Musa were extremely lax in allowing Sevilla to get the ball to Escudero to Sarabia's goal. The unstinting effort that took Leicester to last season's title and this stage in Europe's premier competition had slackened. \nWith it the organisation, the rigidity. At times in the first half, there was the curious sight of centre-half Morgan charging forward, with Vardy and Musa miles ahead of a deep-lying midfield, giving Sevilla acres of space in which to pass the ball around. Jamie Vardy's 73rd-minute goal have Leicester a lifeline in their 2-1 defeat at Sevilla on Wednesday. \nThis was something approaching tactical anarchy, bringing once more into question whether Ranieri is now able to organise his players into something like a recognisable shape. They did not play like a team acting under any kind of instructions. Gray came on for Musa in the 58th minute, Ranieri finally correcting his selection error -- Musa had been as poor as he was at Millwall -- and Leicester at last had some thrust in the team. \nAlongside that came a rediscovery of their fighting qualities, and Vardy's strike. While Sevilla may wonder what might have been, Leicester might reflect that they had staged an almighty escape from their first-half horrors. \n3. Sevilla's quality does not receive its reward \nSevilla has not lost a home European knockout tie since August 2011. The winners of the past three Europa League tournaments now look a real danger in the Champions League. Coach Jorge Sampaoli, sat in the stands as he completed a European ban, in his first season of club football across the Atlantic from South America, has already become a name linked with the top jobs on the continent. \nEarlier in the day, Real Madrid's 2-1 La Liga defeat to Valencia opened a route back into the Spanish title race, and the slickness of Sevilla's football in this first leg confirmed them as no pushover for anyone they might soon meet in the last eight. This was a team vastly different from last season, with there being only five starting survivors from May's Basel final victory over Liverpool. \nSampaoli's system allows freedom of expression while at the same time demanding a high work ethic. Steven N'Zonzi and Samir Nasri, a pair of French Premier League graduates, controlled the centre. \nN'Zonzi patrolled in a style that would have given Leicester fans painful memories of N'Golo Kante, as Nasri sprinkled creative dust, but an eventual lack of finishing quality and Schmeichel's performance denied Sevilla the result they would have desired. \nJohn Brewin is a staff writer for ESPN FC.
