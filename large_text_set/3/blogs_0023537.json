Down Syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that is caused by an error in cell division which results in an extra 21st chromosome. \n(Picture: Laura Kilgus) The condition leads to impaired cognitive ability and physical growth. \nWhy you need to stop feeling guilty about putting your happiness first Each person with Down Syndrome is affected differently, but most will have a number of physical characteristics and developmental problems. \nMany will have a small nose and mouth, eyes that slant upwards and outwards, broad hands with short fingers, and below-average weight and length at birth. \nAll children with Down Syndrome will have a level of learning disability and delayed development, and 1 in 10 children will also experience additional difficulties such as autism spectrum disorder or ADHD . \nWhat events are taking place this year? In the UK, Shabang Inclusive Learning from Slaithwaite in West Yorkshire have released a 3 minute film called ‘Love That Extra Chromosome’. \n\nSt Botolph’s Church in Boston, Lincolnshire, will be lit up with yellow and blue lights every evening for a week.\nCornwall’s Down Syndrome Support Group will be running a Dance Flash Mob to raise awareness. \n\nMy Feral Heart, a film which explores the contemporary issues faced by people with Down Syndrome, will be screened at over 60 cinemas across the UK . \nVisit the OurScreen website to find out where your nearest cinema is. \n\nWhat is the #LOTSOFSOCKS campaign? To raise awareness, people are being asked to wear colourful socks on 21 March. \nThe aim behind the campaign is to get people asking about your socks, so you can take the opportunity to tell them about World Down Syndrome Day.\nTomorrow, wear your most colorful socks for #WDSD17 !
