They don't care if millions of people lose their insurance and health care. They don't care if it's complicated to unwind a law this complex. They don't care if there are consequences. They just don't care. They were promised Obamacare and they want it now . “In order for Democrats to negotiate in earnest on a replacement plan, they have to understand that we’re serious about repealing what we currently have,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said in an interview Monday. “It is critically important we deliver on the promises we made to the American people.” \nMr. Meadows said the Freedom Caucus planned to discuss Monday night whether to adopt an official stance in favor of immediate repeal of the law, which would require the support of 80% of their members. […] \nIn the Senate, Republicans say they are working on fixing the health-law’s failing components. “We will repair the damage that Obamacare has caused millions of Americans,” Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) wrote in a statement Sunday. “We will do that by replacing Obamacare with better, lower-cost alternatives and repealing the parts of Obamacare that have caused the damage.” \nRep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), another conservative leader, said conservatives are alarmed about the talk from centrist Republicans of stopping short of a full repeal of the ACA. “That causes greater concern,” he said. \nWhat all this means is that there is still no replacement plan, which is nothing new. It also means there's no hope of getting a Republican replacement plan because the divisions in the party are just too huge. That is also not new. There's also no chance Democrats step up to help, because why would they? It's too satisfying to watch them continue to flounder. So Meadows' bright idea of getting Democrats to \"negotiate in earnest\" (or more plainly, bail them out) is just super pathetic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T20:34:30.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
