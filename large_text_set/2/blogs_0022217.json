But unlike his usual undercover sting operations, this footage was allegedly sourced from a CNN insider who apparently grew frustrated with the biased reporting of the \"fake news\" media outlet.\nIn his radio interview with Hannity earlier this week, O'Keefe promised \"hundreds of hours of tape from within the establishment media\" and effectively declared war on the mainstream media saying \"our next target is in fact, the media.\"\nO'Keefe: In the next 48 hours, Project Veritas, like Wikileaks, will be releasing hundreds of hours of tape from within the establishment media. Our next target is in fact, the media.\nHannity: How long have you been working on this?\nO'Keefe: We've had people on the inside come to us.
