For a time, no traffic was crossing west from St. Paul, but by 5:15 p.m., the bridge was open again, police said. No one was arrested in the march, which included American Indian dancers and chanting against the pipeline. Marchers carried signs that read \"Honk if you love water,\" Not just a native issue, it's a nation issue\" and \"Say no to environmental racism.\" More from Star Tribune", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:18:47.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
