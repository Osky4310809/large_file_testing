Guests dined amid centerpieces of flowers and citrus fruits, garlands, sparkling light strands and mismatched glassware. During the brides’ first dance, a blast of — what else? — confetti enhanced the beautiful moment.\nThe nuptials’ Palm Springs location was special to the couple, as it was where the OITNB writer popped the question in October with a dazzling yellow-gold engagement ring featuring an asscher-cut diamond.\nYes. \nA post shared by Samira Wiley (@whododatlikedat) on Oct 4, 2016 at 9:08am PDT\nMorelli was previously married and split from her husband after she realized she was gay while writing for the hit Netflix series. She penned an essay on Identities.Mic at the time detailing her experience. “I realized I was gay in fall 2012, one of my first days on the set,” she wrote.\nFROM COINAGE: Wedding Etiquette Isn’t Hard, but Just in Case Here Are Eight Tips \n“Accordingly, I was nervous about the first love scene I’d written for Alex and Piper,” she explained. “I loved writing it, loved watching a tenderness emerge in their relationship where passion always seemed to be the ruling principle, but by that time, I was so deep in my own self-doubt that I constantly felt like a fraud.”\nUno mas… #throwback to that one time we got the perfect \"kiss me\" selfie. Happy Love Day, everyone. \nA post shared by Samira Wiley (@whododatlikedat) on Feb 14, 2017 at 5:52pm PST\nMorelli told Out magazine in December that although she was open with her husband and they tried couples therapy, the issue was obviously not something fixable within their relationship — and that Wiley became a source of comfort in figuring out her next steps.\n“Samira became my outlet, and through that process I fell in love with her,” she said. “But I thought, This will be the one that got away. Being with her felt too good to be true.”\nLater, almost two years after she began dating Wiley, Morelli planned to propose right before they headed out for the vacation so they could use the time in Palm Springs to celebrate the engagement.\n“I found a ring, they shipped it to me,” Morelli added to Out of their engagement. “I was so nervous and terrified she knew it was coming, but she was so shocked that I couldn’t get her to stop crying.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T04:30:02.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
