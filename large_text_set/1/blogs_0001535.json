With Boston in a perfect triangle, Frank Vatrano fed the puck to Austin Czarnik on the left dot, and Czarnik passed to Tim Schaller right in front of the net. \nSchaller was robbed, however, on a nice pad save by Sabres goaltender Robin Lehner, but the Bruins forward did score in the second period. \nWatch it all unfold on the Arbella Coverage Cam in the video above.
