It sounds kind of like those toothbrushes that stop working when you brush too hard.\nWe have no idea how useful a smart hairbrush can be — the product isn’t out yet — but we know it costs “under $200” and will launch sometime in “mid-2017.”\nThe internet-of-things industry hinges on a strategy of trial and error (pack sensors into stuff, see what sticks), and this product, the Kérastase Hair Coach, is living proof.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:02:31.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
