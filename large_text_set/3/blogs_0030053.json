Trimble, a junior, averaged 16.8 points, 3.7 assists, 3.6 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game this year for Maryland. He led the Terrapins to the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Xavier in the round of 64. Sam Vecenie of Sporting News wasn't surprised to see Trimble make the decision to turn pro: Sam Vecenie @Sam_Vecenie Not a surprise. Trimble wanted to go last year. Really good kid, and I wish him the best of luck even if I’m skeptical on his game. https://t.co/kHLPqE1uf2 3/29/2017, 3:50:30 PM Whether Trimble gets drafted is another story. DraftExpress currently has him ranked as the No. 92 prospect in the 2017 NBA draft. ESPN's Chad Ford doesn't have Trimble in his top 100. And Bleacher Report's Jonathan Wasserman didn't have Trimble on his most recent big board, outlining his top 50 players for the upcoming draft. Trimble has an uphill battle to overcome. He'll need to impress in his predraft workouts and at the NBA Draft Combine—assuming he's invited— if he wants to be drafted.
