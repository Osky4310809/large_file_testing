(Photo: The CW /Warner Bros. TV ) \nThe character, whose last live-action appearance was as a child on DC's Legends of Tomorrow but who helped Bane orchestrate his attack on Gotham in The Dark Knight Rises , will be played by V and Stargate SG-1 actress Lexa Doig. \nThe CW describes the character as \"the daughter of Ra's al Ghul (Matt Nable) and the half-sister of Nyssa (Katrina Law). Worldly and cultured, Talia is an elite warrior who doesn't pick sides but rather creates her own. She will initially appear in episode 510 and appear in multiple episodes.\" \nShe previously appeared as a child in DC's Legends of Tomorrow . \nNo word yet on whether Nable or Law will share screen time with Doig during the season. \n\"There's always talk. Whether or not those talks will ever come to fruition is another matter, but I would love to have a reunion with Talia,\" Law recently said . \"I just think having the two sisters either fight side by side together or fight with each other would be epic either way. And then if we could somehow do some sort of flashback with Ra's al Ghul coming in as well... Let's petition to make that happen.\" Arrow Wednesday at 8 PM ET on CW ComicBook Composite 83.91 #12 All-Time Comic TV Shows Average rating", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T07:01:06.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
