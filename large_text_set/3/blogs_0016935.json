A celebrity-riddled place in New York City already, the Hollywood outlet is sure to bring in the same kind of A-list clientele as the Manhattan original, with a David Rockwell-designed space that spans a mere 4,000 square feet just outside the new Dream Hotel project. Not massive, but just enough room to unleash some unabashed revelry. The place looks like a “grand estate frozen in time,” with plenty of custom design points and a lounge-style seating array. Expect world-class DJs spinning beats while the drink offerings are classic club-style booze: bottles and easy mixers. And when you get hungry, just pop over to Alvin Cailan’s pizza joint , Luchini, for slices and more. Tao, Beauty & Essex, and rooftop pool bar The Highlight Room will join Avenue for a NYC-style free for all in Hollywood. Hours run Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. The best way to get in is through the reservations tab on the website . 1601 Cahuenga Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90028", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:22:18.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
