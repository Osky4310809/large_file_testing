The rainbow gleaming behind them seems to tie every aspect of this amazing mama’s journey together at last. \nPhotographer Mary Maloney told BabyCenter about how this inspiring photograph came to be, saying, “I have a breastfeeding series coming out on my website to support #normalizebreastfeeding and women empowering women. Jessa saw my ad online looking for brave breastfeeding Mamas and contacted me to ask if she could be part of it.” \nHer participation was fortuitous. “I had already purchased the rainbow gown as since the last image we took of her, I have had a flood of requests for similar sessions. I was so excited to tell her I had this gown from Sew Trendy that I purchased and hadn’t used yet and we could use it for her breastfeeding image.” Mary also purchased a rainbow veil for the baby. \n“Since it was outdoors in the winter elements and the baby was feeding we wanted to be quick,” Mary told us about the shoot. “Her daughter did perfect. Not a peep. A complete angel.” \nShe added, “For me, sitting back 20 feet with camera in hand and taking the photographs, looking at Jessa in her rainbow dress and holding her new baby she had awaited for so long…..it was the most peaceful wave of emotion that came over me. Everything always turns out ok. The baby is here. She is absolutely beautiful. The rainbow after the storm.” \nSee more images from Mary’s breastfeeding series to #normalizebreastfeeding. \nBreastfeeding images: Mary Maloney of Pebbles and Polka Dots . \nRainbow baby pregnancy image: JoAnn Marrero of From Labor to Love , and Mary Maloney. \nWhat is your reaction to this amazing followup image?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:27:36.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
