No, it wasn’t mermaid eyeshadow or Tom Brady’s Super Bowl jersey. \nEllen had a finger splint on after a drunken mishap caused her to have to make a hospital visit. The talk show host said she was returning home from a dinner party with wife Portia de Rossi. \nAfter having two glasses of wine, a tipsy Ellen tripped and got her finger caught in a door as she walked up the steps leading to her front door. \nCan you relate? If we’re being real, probably. But it’s all good, we’ve all been there once or twice. Giphy \nShe explained to her audience, \nSo, you know how in gymnastics when you do a one-handed cartwheel and you have to spread the weight evenly between all your fingers? Well, I had two glasses of wine and fell into a door. \nDon’t hate on Ellen’s alcohol tolerance. Giphy \nDeGeneres went on to say, \nSo Portia and I were coming home from a dinner party and, uh… Drive home, almost at the front door — literally like at the front door… The dogs were so excited to see us, and I just got the lip of the top step. I was like a foot away from the door and I fell into the door. It did something to my finger and I knew something was wrong. \nShe then showed her viewers a gruesome photo of her injured finger, and let’s just say it is not for the squeamish.
