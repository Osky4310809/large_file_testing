Social Acceptance Drives Growth \nAs state legislators vote in favor of marijuana, recreational and medical pot use continues to expand, raking in new tax streams while lifting the taboo associated with weed. On average, Millennials no longer view marijuana with the same stigma as other “drugs,” instead consuming the plant much like any other recreational product. Further, an aging population has turned to medical marijuana as an alternative to what’s been offered from the highly criticized pharmaceutical industry. As a result, across the country, pot sales are predicted to rise 29% annually until 2020. \nOn the other hand, grown-up Millennials are shying away from the cereal of their childhood. Food industry giants such as General Mills Inc. ( GIS ) and Kellogg ( K ) have seen their sales dragged down by declining volumes of their cereal businesses.

Long-Time Food Giants Struggle as Their Cereal Volumes Decline \nAccording Euromonitor data, total breakfast cereal volumes fell 2% in 2016. Despite food giants’ efforts to restructure and evolve to meet a new demand through new branding campaigns and recipe revisions, Euromonitor predicts volumes will continue to fall. Ultimately, the market research firm says traditional companies are failing to keep up with Millennial consumers who see cereal as “outdated” and “inconvenient.” \nBy contrast, a recent Gallop report indicates that 19% of Americans from ages 18 to 29 say they “currently smoke” pot, higher than the estimated 13% of the total U.S. population.
