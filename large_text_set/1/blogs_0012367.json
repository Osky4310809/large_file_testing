Mobile Fun has listed the Olixar Ultra-Thin Samsung Galaxy S8 Edge Case for the device, and we think the images of the case could be based on the actual Galaxy S8 (or at least based on a very close version of the final design). \nOf course, there is no way to confirm this, but should the Galaxy S8 turn out like this, the phone could be a visual treat. We just hope Samsung has built in proper palm rejection into the display, as the device would otherwise be an ergonomic nightmare in everyday usage. The lack of an iris scanner is suspicious, but it’s possible it could be the sensor right next to the camera (on the Note 7, the iris scanner was on the left side of the camera). Oh, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack seems to be missing as well. \nIt’s highly probable that this is another case (no pun intended) of an accessory maker joining in on the fun in an attempt to get more exposure. At the very least, the case pictured could be close to the real deal, but not 100 percent accurate. There is no way to be sure, and we will just to keep hoping that something concrete comes up in the near future. \nWhat do you guys make of the newest Galaxy S8 case renders?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T14:50:38.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
