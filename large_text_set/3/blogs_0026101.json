According to The Washington Times, Garcia may have been the 15-year-old girl’s stepfather when Delgado became pregnant with her first child. This is something Obama’s feds missed last year after Garcia was arrested for allegedly smuggling five other illegal immigrants into the United States. \nBack then, prosecutors decided not to pursue the smuggling case and Garcia was let go after he made bond on the charges. Months later, Garcia was approved for a work permit, which made him eligible for taxpayer benefits. \n“This guy is the reason that Trump got elected ,” said Rep. Duncan Hunter. “No matter how many times people say it’s not true, and the media says things like this are on the fringe, this is why Trump got elected. And in California, this is not a fringe case.”   \nThis is why so many people voted for Trump, because he vowed to change the system that allowed Garcia to live, work, and kill in this country. \nHere is just a snippet of Garcia’s lengthy criminal record . 2008: Garcia was arrested for assault, but local prosecutors dropped the case. 2009: Garcia was charged with theft, but the case was dismissed. 2011: ICE arrested Garcia and tried to deport him, but he was granted bond and released. 2016: Garcia was arrested for smuggling five other illegal immigrants into the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security took over the case and pushed for trial, but the local U.S. attorney refused to prosecute. 2016: ICE tried to deport Garcia again, but he was released on bond and applied for legal status in the U.S. November 2016: Obama administration approved Garcia’s work permit, allowing him to get a driver’s license, a Social Security number and taxpayer benefits. \nNow, Garcia is charged with murdering his 15-year-old one-time stepdaughter, who already had one child with him and was nine months pregnant with another. \nAuthorities believe that the same gun Garcia used to try to commit suicide after the murder, a .22 caliber pistol, was the weapon used to kill the young girl and her unborn child.
