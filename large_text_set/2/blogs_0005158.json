That’s all. Everything ends. And it’s always sad. But everything begins again, too, and that’s always happy.”\nThat sentiment, spoken so eloquently by the 12th Doctor last year’s Christmas special, exemplifies BBC favorite Doctor Who .\nThirteen actors have stepped into the titular role, transitioning from one to another through the concept of regeneration—instituted in 1966 to allow the show to continue after the departure of its main character.\nNow, with the impending exit of star Peter Capaldi and another regeneration expected in December, YouTube user TheGaroStudios picked the right time to share a tribute to the Time Lord.\nThe video, titled “Everything Ends,” recaps the Doctor’s story—from his ninth incarnation (Christopher Eccleston) to his 12th (Capaldi)—in true wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey fashion. Just don’t blink.\nIn this four-minute supercut, Georgian video editor David Garuchava pieces together the Doctor’s confessions, admissions, and final words before each recent regeneration. (I’m not crying, you’re crying!)\nTheGaroStudios’ “Everything Ends,” published Jan. 13, has more than 164,350 views and 6,500-plus likes; it even got the stamp of approval from the official Doctor Who YouTube channel.\nSeason 10 of Doctor Who returns to BBC and BBC America on April 15, marking the final dozen episodes from showrunner Steven Moffat and Capaldi’s pragmatic Doctor.\nBut, it also introduces new companion Bill (Pearl Mackie), and what appears to be a number of fresh— and refreshed —characters, including emoji-face robots and an update to classic villains, the Ice Warriors.\nIf the 50-year-old reptilian rapscallions don’t feed your nostalgia, the BBC recently released Doctor Who ‘s lost four-season serial “The Power of the Daleks” on DVD and Blu-ray.\nAlso, keep an eye out this weekend as the Doctor’s greatest enemies hit the big screen in The Lego Batman Movie : Daleks (or “British robots,” as they’re called) team up with the Joker and a handful of other non-DC Comics “uber villains” to wreak havoc on Gotham City.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/EeLjMzHMAV8?feature=oembed?wmode=transparent"], "published": "2017-02-08T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:16:57.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
