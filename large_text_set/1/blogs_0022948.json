Delta apologizes to customers for the inconvenience.” \nInternational flights were also unaffected. \nThe Delta website and app were also down for a period of time late Sunday, the airline confirmed via Twitter. \nKLM and Virgin America airlines were also affected, the Port Authority said. \nAs CBS2’s Erin Logan reported, all was calm at Newark Liberty International Airport late Sunday, and no passengers who spoke to CBS2 said they had been affected. \nBut annoyed passengers did take to Twitter, and Delta apologized for any inconvenience. \nShortly after midnight Monday morning, Delta reported that operations were “returning back to normal” and advised passengers to check back on flight times. \nAbout 150 flights were canceled Sunday night with more expected, Delta said. Not all delays and cancellations were reflected on Delta’s systems. \nLast weekend, United Airlines grounded all domestic flights for about two hour due to an “an IT issue.” \nSources told CBS News’ Kris Van Cleave the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) for United went down on Sunday of last week. The system records and transmits information that pilots need to know in order to safely take off. \nBack in August, Delta suffered a similar problem in which a computer glitch lasted more than five hours. The airline canceled more than 200 flights. \nDelta told investors the glitch cost the airline more than $150 million. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
