There was a division quite late last night on an amendment tabled by the Labour peer, Peter Hain, saying the prime minister should commit to keeping Britain in the single market before she triggers article 50. Lib Dem peers backed the Hain amendment, but it was opposed by the Conservatives and Labour and was defeated by 299 votes to 136. \nIn the debate Lady Hayter of Kentish Town , the shadow Brexit minister, explained why Labour was not supporting Hain’s move. She said accepting the amendment would mean acting “as if the referendum hadn’t happened” and effectively “asking the prime minister to eat her own words”. She went on: \nWith regard to free movement, we cannot simply airbrush this from the referendum decision. For if we turn round to those who voted out, and we say ‘yes we are out, but actually we are still having everything exactly as it was, we are still having free movement unchanged’, I think that might emit some surprise. \nBut after the vote the Lib Dems criticised Labour for supporting the government on this. Lord Newby , the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, said: \nBy far the best option for our economy is to stay in the single market. Unfortunately Theresa May’s Ggvernment is hell bent on dragging us towards a hard Brexit. \nWhatever deal May comes back with is quite simply not going to be as good as remaining in the single market. That is why we voted to ask her to think again on this vital issue. \nIt is extremely disappointing that Labour chose not support this amendment despite the costs of a hard Brexit on working people’s jobs and prosperity. \nPeers do not debate the bill again until tomorrow, but we are likely to hear plenty more on Brexit today. Here is the agenda for the day. \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n9.45am: The British Chambers of Commerce conference opens. At 10.20am there is a panel discussion featuring George Osborne, the former chancellor, Andy Burnham, the Labour candidate for mayor of the Greater Manchester, and Andy Street, the Conservative candidate for mayor of the West Midlands; at 11am John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor speaks; at 11.55am Greg Clark, the business secretary, speaks; and at 12.40pm Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, speaks. \n11.30am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. \n1pm: Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, speaks at a press gallery lunch. \n2.15pm: Sir Julian King, the European commissioner for security, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. \nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time.
