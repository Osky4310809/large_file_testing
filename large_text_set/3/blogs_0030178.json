Gomez went to a Los Angeles high school to speak to a group of young women last week and truly used her star status for an incredible reason.\nGomez is part of the Step Up organization through her affiliation with Coach. If you’ve never heard of Step Up before, it’s worth learning about. The network helps empower women, especially women from under-resourced communities, to help turn them into inspiring leaders . Through the organization, women have a better chance of becoming college-bound.\nGomez is the perfect fit to help represent the cause. She teamed up with TODAY to visit the girls and spread some positivity. “I want them to see that they’re able to have the same dreams and same goals,” Selena Gomez said to Sheinelle Jones. “I just want them to feel like they’re capable of doing anything.” @instagram is celebrating world kindness day and I got to spend it with people who fully will change our world one day. @coach introduced me to @stepupwomensnetwork which is an after school organization that encourages girls to believe that they have the capability to do anything they set their mind to. It's crazy to me how much they are willing put others before themselves. # #CoachXStepUP #DreamBig \nA post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Mar 23, 2017 at 6:09pm PDT \nThe day obviously meant a lot to the girls, who seemed to admire Gomez’s ability to keep it real . And, speaking of, there was one line that really made Gomez shine. It’s something that all of us ought to remember.\n“They’re worth more than an Instagram like, and they’re worth more than a comment on any of their social platforms,” Gomez said. That’s a really powerful statement, if you think about it. Next time you’re obsessively checking social media, remember that you’re not the equivalent to the amount of attention you get on Instagram.\nIf you want to support Step Up, check out their website for multiple ways you can get involved. It’s definitely an organization that’ll remind you how strong and powerful we can truly be, with a little bit of encouragement.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T18:58:51.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
