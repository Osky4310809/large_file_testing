They are born, and their birth sequence is — gulp — gnarly.\nSo we learned Monday night at Cinemacon, where Sony Pictures sneaked a few minutes of Blade Runner 2049 , Ridley Scott's revisitation of the sci-fi cult classic from 1982. And it looks dark . So dark that its nightmarscape of synthesized humans makes Westworld look like a walk in the park.\nSEE ALSO: Westworld Robot Self-Destructs\nThe first teaser footage was released in December — and this one greatly expands the world which one new replicant hunter, Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is trying to navigate with the help of an old one, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford, returning to the franchise).\nYou want cyberpunk stuff? It's here in holograms, dirty streets and brutalist buildings all around. You want Jared Leto creepily whispering \"Happy birthday\" to a newly born, goo-covered replicant girl? It's here too, and it's post-Joker ghoulish.\nAnd you want Deckard's gun dotted with red lights? It's also here — and it's in Gosling's hand.\nThe sizzle reel (or is it a trailer? It's not yet clear) sneaked before a convention of cinema owners was an intermix of old, original footage with new, including the interior of a giant, concert hall-like museum of wood and steel where Officer K finally sees where the sausage, errrr, the replicants, are made.\nMost of the interplay between Ford and Gosling was stuff we saw in the first teaser — \"I had your job once. I was good at it,\" Ford growls — though now we see the building where they meet coming under attack, and an escape ensues. Looks like these two will be on the run together.\nFinally, we get first looks at Robin Wright as the unnamed Stern Female Authority Figure required in all dystopian cinema (\"There is an order to things,\" she says, \"That's what we do here: we keep order\") and Mackenzie Davis, ostensibly as a painted is-she-or-isn't-she-a-replicant character of some kind.\nIn the final shot, we see Officer K staring down at a book with a whole bunch of pages ripped out of the middle. \"Your story isn't over yet,\" a female voice tells him.\nAnd neither is this marketing campaign. Director Denis Villeneuve's ( Arrival ) vision for a Blade Runner in the even more distant future arrives in theaters Oct. 6.\nWATCH: The most anticipated movies of 2017", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Cu5CJNDG.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Cu5CJNDG.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-28T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T07:37:31.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
