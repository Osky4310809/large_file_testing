According to Pro Football Focus, he was also the best “crossing route” wideout in the NFL. Related: Kenny Britt was the best crossing route receiver in 2016 \nBut according to a recent update from Alden Gonzalez, chances are the Rams will not re-sign Britt ( via ESPN ): \n“The veteran receiver is coming off his first 1,000-yard-receiving season, which was also the Rams’ first since 2007, and will now be an unrestricted free agent. Chances are that the Rams, now under the direction of the offensive-minded Sean McVay, will move on. They’ll prioritize other targets in free agency, perhaps the likes of DeSean Jackson, Pierre Garcon , Kenny Stills and the real prize, Alshon Jeffery. Britt may be better off moving on, too. He’s an eight-year veteran, coming off his third season with the Rams, and may want to pair with a more established quarterback than Jared Goff.” \nWhile Gonzalez mentions other free agent options, there’s also the option that Los Angeles decides to take a wideout with one of its first few picks in April’s draft. \nEven if the Rams do not keep Britt on their roster for next season, they have various other options to replace his production with extra cap space saved on his salary.
