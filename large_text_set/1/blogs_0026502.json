Claims that Lord Coe misled an MPs' inquiry have grown after new emails confirmed he was \"made aware\" of corruption allegations in his sport four months before they became public. \nThe president of the IAAF, athletics' governing body, told a select committee in December 2015 he was \"not aware\" of specific allegations of corruption around the Russian doping scandal. \nBut the email from Lord Coe to the IAAF's Ethics Commission in August 2014 states: \"I have now been made aware of the allegations.\" \nIn 2015, Lord Coe told Parliament: \"I was certainly not aware of the specific allegations that had been made around the corruption of anti-doping processes in Russia.\" \nMPs had wanted the IAAF president to return to the committee after former athlete David Bedford's testimony to the Culture, Media and Sport select committee inquiry into doping in sport appeared to contradict Lord Coe's. \nThe president has so far declined to return to the committee, but agreed to two requests from MPs to release missing correspondence between Michael Beloff, chair of the IAAF ethic commission, and him. \nThe emails, published on Tuesday by the committee, cast fresh light on the issue of what Lord Coe knew - and when - about the burgeoning Russian corruption and doping scandal which has blighted world athletics. \nCommittee chairman Damian Collins told the BBC: \"Whatever excuse he gives, it is clear that Lord Coe decided not to share with the committee information that was relevant to our inquiry on doping in sport. \n\"The committee asked him about his knowledge of doping in Russian athletics and of corruption within the sport. In his answers, he gave the impression that he was unaware of specific allegations. \n\"Thanks to evidence that was presented by the BBC Panorama programme last year, and by David Bedford to the committee this January, we can see that he was aware, at least in general terms, of the allegations that had been brought forward by the Russian athlete Liliya Shobukova.\" \nMore to follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T13:29:11.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
