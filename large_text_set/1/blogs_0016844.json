We may need to cover our tracks after searching for certain kinds of apps ) on Google Play . We need to clean things up after our stupid friend/coworker/kid brother searches for apps on our phone as a joke. And when it comes to cleaning our Google Play search history, things are blissfully simple.\nOpen Google Play . Tap the three-line menu button . Swipe up to scroll down .\n\nTap Settings . Tap Clear local searches .\n\nNow, notice that the setting we used only clears Google Play Search history on the local device. If you want to clear search history from more than one device, you'll need to visit your My Activity page in Google and delete the searches individually. You might also want to take the time to purge some other \"activities\" from your history.\nLike us!
