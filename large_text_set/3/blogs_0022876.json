But a war monitoring group said no rebel shelling occurred in the area at that time . \nIsraeli Lieutenant-General Gadi Eisenkot told an academic conference on Tuesday that Badreddine's death last May illustrated \"the depth of the internal crisis of Hezbollah\". \nHe said Israel \"believes that he was killed by his own officers\". Top Hezbollah commander killed in Syria \n\"Those findings show to what degree relations between Hezbollah and its patron Iran are tense and complex.\"Hezbollah has deployed thousands of fighters in Syria, where Badreddine had led its intervention in support of President Bashar al-Assad's forces, which are also backed by Russia and Iran. \nIsraeli intelligence claims Badreddine had been feuding with Iranian military commanders in Syria over the heavy losses his group had suffered on the battlefield. \nIn Beirut, Mohammed Afif, a Hezbollah spokesman, said Israel's allegations were \"lies that do not deserve comment\". \nThe US government has said Badreddine, 55, was in charge of Hezbollah's military operations in Syria. \nHe was one of five Hezbollah members indicted by the UN-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon in the 2005 in connection to the killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and 21 others. \nHezbollah denied any involvement in Hariri's killing and said the charges were politically motivated.

Mughniyeh, who was Badreddine's brother-in-law, was killed in a 2008 car bombing in Damascus that Hezbollah blamed on Israel. \nIn a letter written shortly after Baddredine's death, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif extended condolences \"for the martyrdom of this great jihadist ... who embodied devotion and vigour and was legendary in his defence of high Islamic goals and his defence of the Lebanese people who resist oppression and terrorism\".
