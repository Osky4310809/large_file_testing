The U.S. ship fired the shots into the water after the Iranian ship did not leave after a brief radio conversation. \nThe Iranian vessels had moved at high speed toward the Nitze, which allegedly was operating in accordance with international law in international waters and ignored maritime \"rules of the road\" as set out in the 1972 Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. According to the Navy official, the IRGC vessels ignored multiple warnings, creating a dangerous, harassing environment that could have pushed the Nitze to take defensive measures, escalating the situation. At the time, Iran's defense minister insinuated that the incident occurred inside Iranian territory. \n“Naturally these boats constantly monitor the developments and foreign vessels’ movements and naturally this happens in the waters of our own country. If any foreign vessel enters our waters, we will give them a warning and if it is an act of aggression, we will confront them,” he said. \nIt is unclear if today's incident took place in international waters. \nAs a reminder, there are temporarily no US aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf region at this moment, or anywhere else around the world for that matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T15:03:18.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
