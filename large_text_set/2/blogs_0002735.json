(Courtesy of DILG-Basilan) LAMITAN CITY, Basilan, Philippines -- The mayor of Tuburan, Basilan survived a roadside bombing on Saturday afternoon that seriously injured his driver and damaged his pickup truck. Mayor Durie Kallahal, who survived the bombing unscathed, is known for his hardline stance in dealing with Abu Sayyaf bandits operating in his municipality. The mayorâ€™s driver, initially identified only as Misuari, sustained shrapnel wounds in different parts of his body. Kallahal and his driver were on board a red pickup truck en route to the town proper of Tuburan from somewhere when the roadside bomb, planted on one side of the thoroughfare, went off. Their pickup truck was riddled with holes from metal fragments the explosion sent flying with force. The shrapnel also shattered the truck's glass windows and damaged its rear tires. Investigators are convinced Abu Sayyaf bandits are behind the attack. Civilian volunteers in Tuburan loyal to Kallahal killed more than a dozen Abu Sayyaf gunmen in a series of encounters last year.
