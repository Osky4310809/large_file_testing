Although the photo shows her cheering on Debbie Reynolds accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award, Streep's classy persona, matched with song lyrics that you have not-so-elegantly sung at the top of your lungs, make the latest meme both ridiculous and relatable. \nThe tweets nail how we sing to flashback hits from Britney Spears, Missy Elliott and more -- and have us jamming along just like we used to.

Facebook Posted!   'August: Osage County' stars and Oscar nominees Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep have proven to be the dynamic duo capable of stealing almost every spotlight with their best friendship this awards season. USA TODAY's Andrea Mandell takes a look back at the powerful duo's most memorable Oscar looks. Kevork Djansezian, Getty Images It seems fitting to start with Roberts' most iconic Oscars look: her vintage Valentino gown from 2001 when she won the best-actress Oscar for \"Erin Brockovich.\" Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY The next year, Roberts dipped into something a bit more modern: Armani with cutouts. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY The dress (or the actress) inspired big smiles from 2002 best-actor winner Denzel Washington in the backstage photo room. Jack Gruber, USA TODAY The actress streamlined her look to present the cinematography Oscar in 2003. Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY In 2005, Roberts went back to basics to present Clint Eastwood with the best-director award. It's also the year she was named the highest paid actress in Hollywood, for the second year in a row, according to \"The Hollywood Reporter.\" Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY By 2004, Roberts was ready to dip into (a hint of) color. She wore an Old Hollywood blush satin Armani gown paired with softly curled wavy hair. Bob Riha, Jr., USA TODAY Ready for a throwback? This is Streep in 1983, picking up her Oscar for \"Sophie's Choice\" (from Sylvester Stallone!). Ron Galella, WireImage Time-warp forward to 1999, shall we? Streep glittered like royalty in Valentino, nominated for \"Music of the Heart.\" Bob Riha Jr., USA TODAY In 2000, Streep opted for a Mary McFadden pantsuit for the big day, and brought her daughter as her date. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY In 2003, Streep slipped into some major sleeves and a form-fitting bodice while presenting Peter O'Toole with his honorary Oscar. Timothy A. Clary, AFP/Getty Images Streep wore a graceful plum gown and posed backstage in 2006 with Lily Tomlin with honorary Oscar winner Robert Altman. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY Streep mixed it up in 2007 and took a walk on the wild side, donning this Prada dress. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY Streep (here with Nicole Kidman) piled the Prada look with jewelry (but not a diamond in the bunch!). Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY In 2009, Streep chose a classic Grecian gown by Alberta Ferretti, complemented by one heck of a diamond ring. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY By 2010, Streep, posing here with Vera Farmiga, had adopted what is now her signature look: strong shoulders, a deep V, and a simple updo. Chris Pizzello, AP Here's a full look at her Chris March gown. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY Here's Streep's favorite look again in 2012, this time in gold (and Lanvin). That grin is thanks to a best-actress win for \"The Iron Lady.\" Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Last year, Streep favored an almost identical look (this time in silver) while presenting the best-actor award to Daniel Day-Lewis for \"Lincoln.\" Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Keep your eyes on the fabulous duo March 2 at the Oscars.
