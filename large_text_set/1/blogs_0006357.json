Judging by the players seen — an hilarious reminder that at one point, we had both Pato and Falcao on loan — this was at some point in the second half of last season. (Bonus points for spotting Matt Miazga.) \nThe big joke is of course that Clarkson's changing the subtitles to what Hazard, Courtois, Costa, Willian, and Oscar are saying about his monstrous lifted off-road Land Rover/Mercedes SL creation called 'The Excellent'. And he would've gotten away with it, too, were it not for Gary Cahill. Also enjoyed Ruben Loftus-Cheek's reaction shot to James \"Captain Slow\" May's quip about Sir Alex Ferguson. \nPer Reddit , the actual quotes from the players are: \nHazard: \"The first problem is that in London, it's cold. So convertibles are not good.\" Courtois: \"It's not very comfortable. And I can't see anything.\" Cahill: \"I think this is flipping horrific. You've butchered a classic car.\" Willian: \"There's no comfort, mine is better.\" Oscar: \"Wow, you have to be careful not to break it!\" Willian: \"There are no rats here, right?\" Oscar: \"It's good, the engine is good.\" More From We Ain't Got No History", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T02:22:32.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
