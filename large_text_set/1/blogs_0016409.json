Today, the company is rolling out OxygenOS 4.0.2, which fixes a small, but important, issue on both phones.\nSee also: OnePlus Bullets (V2) Earphones review 1 day ago According to the changelog, the 4.0.2 update fixes a download bug with the Google Play Store. Obviously, if some OnePlus 3 and 3T owners were not able to download apps correctly, this could be a bit of a problem. Hopefully this OxygenOS update will deal with this issue. The changelog also notes some more stability improvements with this release.\nOnePlus also says that some people might still be experiencing some Wi-Fi connectivity problems with this update. If you happen to be one of those folks, you can send a private message to the company to report on this issue via its forums.\nAs with previous updates for the OnePlus 3 and 3T, this latest version of OxygenOS is being rolled out to a small section of those phones, before it is released to a wider number of the devices in the near future. You can go into the phone’s settings to select “About phone”, and then “Software updates”, to see if your OnePlus 3 or 3T can snag OxygenOS 4.0.2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:47:37.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
