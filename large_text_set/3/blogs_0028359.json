Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIt should be 24 hours filled with joy, but this will be a sickening Mother’s Day for Dee Waddington. \nAnd she’ll always remember this one as the day she finally turned her back on the daughter from hell . \nThe daughter who chillingly confessed in court last week to conning her workmates out of thousands of pounds – by pretending she was dying of cancer. \nTwisted Kelsey Whitehead, 38, shaved her head, wore make-up to appear tired and cut her own chest open to insert a fake chemotherapy tube. \nShe even fooled her distraught wife-to-be – and got married wearing a bandana to cover her ‘hair loss’.

They say she faked exam results and qualifications, lied about having a second child and even told pals her family had been killed in a car crash. \nShe also made foul accusations against another family member. \nAnd perhaps most devastatingly for Dee, Whitehead kept secret the birth of a son who was later adopted, denying her mum the chance to ever meet her first grandchild. \nFighting back tears, Dee says: “I love my daughter. I’ll always feel a mother’s love for her, but I’m ashamed of her behaviour. Now I have no choice but to turn away from her. \n“I’ve offered to get help for her over and over, but she’s refused. I feel so sorry for the people who believed she had cancer. They must feel very betrayed and hurt. Kelsey has gone too far. It’s painful to let go but I’ve no choice. \n“The child I had is gone. This woman is a stranger to me.” Read More Mum-to-be's biggest concerns about their new baby have been revealed Before the lies began Kelsey was an 'adored' little girl (Photo: Sunday People) \nIn her sick scam, Whitehead said she had cancer in a Facebook post and duped her bosses at Carbon Electric in Hull into thinking she needed private treatment. Convinced by her lies, they loaned her £5,000 and paid her almost £10,000 in sick pay. \nShe was so plausible, her wife gave up her job to care for her. \nMeanwhile, the fraudster kept Dee and Vikki at arm’s length, making excuses not to see them for fear they would recognise her lying behaviour. \nThe hoax only came to light last May when her wife found a spare phone Whitehead had been ­using to keep up her lie. She confessed all to ­police and contacted her mum who lived 60 miles away to cough up to ­another secret – that she was married. \nDee says: “I knew straight away she had kept me away from the wedding because of the way she looked on the day. She has lied to me before about being ill so I’d have suspected straight away.” \nThe court heard how Whitehead even bought a Hickman line catheter from the internet which she inserted into her chest after cutting herself. Whitehead’s lawyer said her long history of lying stemmed from her childhood. \nFor Dee, her daughter’s shaming has come partly as a relief. “It means the truth is out and she can’t cause any more damage. That’s why I’m speaking out - I don’t want her to cause any more.” \nShe traces her daughter’s lies back to the age of nine. Until then, she says, Kelsey had been a cheerful little girl “adored by everyone”.

When Kelsey – born Kelly – reached her teens, her family saw a darker side. \nDee says the first serious alleged lie came when Kelsey started sixth form college and she discovered her daughter had faked the As and Bs on her GCSE results. \n“She got into college to do her A levels on the back of getting great results,” says Dee. “But she started to really struggle. One of her teachers did some investigating and told me her result papers had been forged.” \nDee quizzed Kelsey in what was to be the first of many confrontations which left her exhausted, searching for an answer to her daughter’s lies. \n“She couldn’t tell me why she’d done it,” says Dee. “She just said she was struggling with the work. I’ve asked countless times why she lies but she has never given me an answer. She either denies it or just apologises.” \nDespite being caught out over her exams, Kelsey’s lies, says Dee, only grew bigger. After landing a Saturday job at Tesco, Whitehead is said to have convinced staff she had a desperately ill son, but he never existed. \nDee claims: “I only found out ­because someone from Tesco came round to see her and wondered why there were no longer pictures of her son on the walls. \n“Kelsey used to babysit a little boy next door to us and I suspect she had shown them pictures of him.” Kelsey lied about having cancer to fool bosses and her partner (Photo: Sunday People) \nDee claims that after a family holiday to Crete, Kelsey, by now 17, told friends she’d met abroad her mum and sister had been killed in a car crash on the way back from the airport. \n“One of the friends called the house and almost fainted when I answered,” says Dee. \nAfter this lie was exposed, Kelsey fled the family home. “I think she realised she had nowhere to turn. She stormed out with some things. I thought she’d cool off and come back but she never did,” says her mum. \nWhitehead’s sudden departure sparked years of distress and worry for Dee and her sister Vikki, just 13 at the time. “I tried ­desperately to find her,” says administrator Dee, who lives in York. “I knew she was out there, most likely telling more lies, and I wanted to help her. \n“I’d heard she’d managed to get herself into a children’s home in Leeds, claiming she was still 15. We searched for her, but there was no trace.” \nIn 2003, Dee – who is divorced from the girls’ father – finally got news of her daughter, but the price was an unbearable betrayal. \nSocial services visited the family home to tell them Kelsey had a young son who was going to be adopted. Dee says: “It was my first grandchild and I knew nothing about him. I felt robbed. I’m not sure I can ever forgive her for that. \n“We went to the family courts to try to fight for him but we had to withdraw because Kelsey didn’t want him to have anything to do with us. \n“We’ve no idea why this was. We did nothing wrong. Each year his adoptive parents would write to let us know how he was getting on. It was an annual reminder that I had a grandson who barely knew I existed.” \nIn a last throw of the dice, Dee once again confronted her daughter, offering to get her help for her pathological lying. \n“I told her I’d do anything. I’d fix up for her to see a counsellor or specialist, but she didn’t want it. Then she just vanished again. \n“There were times Vikki and I would find her on social media and I’d send her a message, ­asking her to speak to me, but she’d change her user name and disappear again.

All the while I just wanted to know she was OK. When she did turn up it was because she was in trouble. \n“I would have welcomed her back with open arms because she was my daughter. She promised she’d change and would always apologise for causing so much hurt but then she’d do it again.” \nIn 2011, Vikki heard from friends her sister had set up a charity called Rainbow Rhythms to provide DIY ultrasound machines for women worried about their pregnancy due to previous miscarriages. \nOn the web page, Whitehead, of Gainsborough, Lincs, claims to have lost four babies – but her lying past has left the family sceptical. \nVikki says: “We don’t even know if that’s true. The problem is Kelsey is so utterly convincing. When she was caught out lying about cancer I spoke to her wife. \n“She said Kelsey had told her she had a son called Nathan. But her wife was becoming suspicious about Kelsey’s cancer and asked to speak to Nathan, who then started sending her texts. \n“But when Kelsey was rushed to hospital her wife found a spare phone that had texts from ‘Nathan’ on it. \n“I think Kelsey had been pretending to be this boy. Her wife also said Kelsey kept her medicine under lock and key. When she found the key to the box it was full of vitamin pills and not cancer ­medication. \n“She said she was leaving Kelsey, but they are back together. I guess she’s been sucked back into her web of lies.” \nWhile Vikki has never longed for a ­relationship with her sister – now on a 20-week night time curfew and undergoing rehabilitation – Dee has always hoped she would change. Until now.

I dispute some of the allegations, but am not willing to comment on them in the newspaper. \n“I have made many mistakes and I am finally facing up to them and trying to put things right.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:23:38.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
