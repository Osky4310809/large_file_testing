Earlier this week Rory McIlroy was asked the importance of being world No. 1 , and he admitted it was essentially an ego boost. If all goes well on Sunday, his ego will be boosted. If McIlroy, who is tied for third place and two shots back, wins on Sunday and current world No. 1 Dustin Johnson (who is in second place) finishes in a tie for fourth or worse, the Northern Irishman will move back into the top spot. McIlroy last held the No. 1 ranking in June 2015. \n2. The reviews for this week’s stop in Mexico and Club de Golf Chapultepec have largely been positive , but the poa greens have left a few players confused and a little cranky.

Mackay was noticeably slow moving around the course as he continued his recovery on Saturday. “He was good; Bones was good today. Yeah, it seemed to be only a 24-hour thing,” Mickelson said. \n4. Justin Thomas’ father, Mike, has a collection of golf balls from the tournament's his son has won that he keeps in a special case. That said, the display for the balls Justin's used to make a hole-in-one is a little less grand. Following his ace at the 13th hole on Saturday, Thomas was asked what his father would do with the ball. “I think he has them like in a shoe box in his office,” he said.
