Think pinks, violets, purples, and indigos for some extra magick. To get the look, a hairstylist will lighten the ends of your hair, and then tone it to a white blonde before layering the colors with the darker on the ends and the lighter farther up the hair. The results are not only mesmerizing, but really stunning.\nA post shared by Hairdresser On Fire (@hdresseronfire) on Mar 6, 2017 at 5:26am PST \nIf you’re feeling like you need change, or simply want to embrace your inner crystal child this spring, then don’t fret. Amethyst hair is here, and we are also here for it. Just make sure you go to a professional to achieve this look. You won’t regret it!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:06:12.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
