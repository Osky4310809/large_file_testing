Danius didn’t specify if the meeting would be held before or after the concerts. ‘Nervous’ Patti Smith sings for Bob Dylan at Nobel prize ceremony \nThe first songwriter to win the prestigious prize will not hold the traditional Nobel lecture during the meeting, she said. The lecture is the only requirement to receive the SEK8m (€839,000, £726,000) that comes with the prize. \n“Please note that no Nobel lecture will be held. The academy has reason to believe that a taped version will be sent at a later point,” Danius said. According the Nobel rules Dylan would forfeit his prize money if he ddid not deliver a lecture by June. \nDylan missed the Nobel ceremony in December because of “pre-existing commitments”. In a speech read out by the US ambassador to Sweden Dylan said he was stunned and surprised when he was told he had won because he had never stopped to consider whether his songs were literature.
