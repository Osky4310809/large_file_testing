Where to travel every month of the year Jan. 14, 2017, 1:08 PM 8,133 \nIn July, climb to the top of Mt Fuji, Japan's highest peak. Bule Sky Studio/Shutterstock \nLONDON — If you love to travel, chances are your destination bucket list is long and overwhelming. \nIn order to help plan your next trip, we consulted Lonely Planet 's \"Where to Go When\" guide, which acts as a trip planner for every month of the year. \nThe guide provides 30 recommendations for each month of the year based on unmissable events, as well as which places are cheapest or have the best weather. \nWe combed through the recommendations to pick the best holiday spot for each calendar month. \nFrom winter in Tasmania to spring in Tobago, scroll down to see where you should be heading every month of the year. January: Tasmania, Australia Catherine Sutherland/Lonely Planet \nThe Australian island of Tasmania is known for its amazing food and breathtaking wilderness. In January, when Tasmia is its warmest and driest, enjoy the walking trails and empty beaches, eat fresh oysters, or look out for white wallabies while on a hike around the iconic Cradle Mountain, pictured above. However, book ahead to avoice hefty accommodation prices. \nFebruary: Lapland, Finland Sara Winter/Shutterstock \nThe stunning aurora borealis (northern lights) are visible in February in Lapland, Finland, which sits just north of the Arctic Circle. It takes up 30% of Finland's land area , but only 3% of its population, making it the perfect spot for a wander, or ride on a husky sled, sleigh, or snowmobile, in the icy, snowy wilderness. Polar night — the period of 24-hour darkness — is over, so you might even see reindeer. \nMarch: Tobago John Harper/Getty Images \nThe sister island of Trinidad is full of beautiful beaches and palm trees, like the above Pigeon Point, as well as birds and sea turtles. The inspiration for Daniel Defoe's \"Robinson Crusoe,\" a trip to Tobago in March will deliver great weather , and will also see nesting sea turtles return to the sand to lay their eggs. \nApril: Thailand Dmitry Pichugin/500px \nThe country may have become a go-to backpacking destination, but with the jungles, food, temples, and tropical beaches and boats like the ones seen above in the Andaman Sea, it's easy to see why. \nApril is the perfect time to get \"hot and wet\" in Thailand, according to Lonely Planet, with temperatures rising above 30°C. You'll get a sea breeze in coastal areas, or head to a rooftop bar in the city for some respite from the heat. From April 13 to 15 you can also take part in Songkran, or Thai New Year, which is celebrated with the world's biggest water fight. May: Montenegro Julian Love/Lonely Planet \nSee the stunning view of the Bay of Kotor by visiting Montenegro in May, when the sun is out and average temperatures are over 20°C . It isn't high season, meaning some bars and restaurants might be closed, but you'll enjoy the beaches, monasteries, or a hike in the mountains without the crowds — which is crucial in such a compact spot. Its also the start of rafting season, which means a visit to the Tara River, which is Europe's deepest, longest canyon. \nJune: Arctic Norway Matt Munro/Lonely Planet \nVisit Norway in midsummer, when the coastline of far northern Norway sees endless light. June is high season in Norway , meaning you need to book ahead, but it's the perfect time to drive through villages, wander the forests and fjords, and take in the scenery. July: Japan Bule Sky Studio/Shutterstock \nJuly is perfect climbing season in Japan, with snow-free trails and warm weather across the country perfect for siteseeing. Climb to the top of Mt Fuji, the nation's highest peak and volcano which sits at 12,388 ft (3776 m), or enjoy the month-long Gion Matsuri, a festival which sees a processio of floats parade through the streets. August: Umbria, Italy Matt Munro/Lonely Planet \nThe perfect spot for a secluded, self-catering retreat in the stunning countryside, even in August you can avoid the crowds of Italy's hotspots if you head to Umbria. As a neighbour to Tuscany, it has incredible food and wine, rolling hillsides, and medieval-walled towns packed with palaces and basilicas. You might want to hire a car, however, so you can fully explore the area. \nSeptember: Georgia Andrew Montgomery/Lonely Planet \nVineyards, meadows, and monasteries are all worthy of exploring in Georgia, which sits north of Turkey and south of Russia. September signals the start of autumn, meaning a grape harvest in the eastern region of Kakheti — hello, wine-tasting — or a trek into the Svaneti region to discover village s guarded by stone towers, all while the weather is warm and the sun is still out. \nOctober: Highlands in Scotland Craig Easton/Lonely Planet \nScotland was named one of 2017's \"must-see\" destinations, and October is the perfect time to go thanks to its stunning fall colours. This is the time of year you'll see male red deer \"rut,\" or joust with their antlers to secure a doe. Explore the lochs, glens, and moors outside of tourist season, visit castles, sip whiskey, and try food such as Scottish lobster or grouse. November: Nicaragua Philip Lee Harvey/Lonely Planet \nWith active volcanoes, beaches, zip lining, and wildlife, Lonely Planet claims Nicaragua is \" on the cusp of becoming Central America’s Next Big Thing.\" November is dry and warm, and may even give you a chance to spot olive ridley turtles. \nDecember: Switzerland VogelSP/Getty Images \nVisit Switzerland in December for a stunning ride on the famous sightseeing train, the Glacier Express. It takes seven hours to travel 180 miles (290 km), but it's worth every minute for the panoramic views from the coaches. Start in Matterhorn, and pass snowy Matter, the valles of Rhône and Rhine, villages, hilltop castles, and the Landwasser Viaduct before ending at the popular St Moritz ski resort.
