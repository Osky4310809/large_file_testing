The car promises to regain its title of the segment leader as Honda has injected several segment-first features in the City’s recipe. It will be available in five different variants - S, SV, V, VX and ZX. There are a host of changes, both inside and outside the cabin. On the exterior, the car now gets revamped front and rear bumpers, bigger air vents, larger and more aggressive front grille and LED powered headlamps, taillights, brake light on spoiler and fog lamps. The car’s restyling is complemented with the newly designed 16-inch diamond cut alloy wheels. Step inside the cabin and the first thing that catches the eye is the new 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with built-in navigation, 1.5GB media memory, MirrorLink connectivity for smartphones, voice recognition and feed from the rear-view camera. The electric sunroof now comes with one-touch open/close operation and all the reading lamps now feature LEDs. Other goodies inside the cabin include leather upholstery, automatic headlamps and wipers, six airbags (dual front, side and curtain), cruise control and automatic climate control with rear AC vents. Engine family remains the same as the model it replaces. That means, where the 1.5-litre i-VTEC engine produces 119PS of power and 145Nm of torque, the 1.5-litre i-DTEC motor generates 100PS of power and 200Nm of torque. Customers opting for the entry-level S variant can only get the car with the petrol motor. Petrol-powered V and VX variants will be offered with either a manual transmission or a CVT. However, the range-topping ZX (petrol) will only be offered with the CVT. The City goes head to head with the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz , Hyundai Verna and Volkswagen Vento . While the Ciaz and the Vento are due for their respective mid-life updates, Hyundai is likely to launch an all-new Verna in this calendar year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:44:36.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
