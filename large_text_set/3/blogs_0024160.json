Where are the Amber alerts for the black & brown girls that have gone missing in the D.C. area? pic.twitter.com/3gG8InV8KF \n— Erika Danielle (@GlamRika) March 24, 2017 Where are the amber alerts via text that used to scare the hell out of me when 'you know who' would go missing? #missingdcgirls https://t.co/mD49S6Cy6w \n— Paulina Denise (@LiinaDeniise) March 24, 2017 \nElite Daily spoke with James Goodwin, a representative of the Office of Justice Programs (OJP). \nThe organization oversees training for AMBER alert programs in each state and collects AMBER alert reports from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). \nGoodwin points out that, \nWhile we certainly cannot speak for individual states, the 2015 AMBER Alert report shows that some 54 percent of alerts issued in 2015 were for “non-white children.” \nThe report also shows that 182 Amber Alerts were sent out in all of 2015. 31 percent the of them were for black children. \nTo put it all in perspective, out of the 460,699 missing children reported in 2015 (according to NCMEC) — only a handful of them made it to the Amber Alert stage, because not all of them fit the strict criteria for activation . \nBasically, the Amber Alerts aren’t just rare for black kids. They’re rare, period. \nAnd that still doesn’t mean we don’t have a problem when it comes to black girls and women going missing. 23-Year-Old Helps Unite Baltimore PD And His Community To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Twitter users are holding media responsible for underreporting. \nThe DC Police Department confirmed to NBC that the number of missing black girls has not increased. \nMetropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Rachel Reid told NBC Washington , \nWe’ve just been posting them on social media more often. \nBut people seem more outraged about the missing reports not being covered in the news as much, and the fact that they have to learn of them via social media. The frustrating thing about the #missingdcgirls , besides the obvious, is Black woman & girls go missing ALL THE TIME w/ little coverage. \n— britni danielle (@BritniDWrites) March 24, 2017 sad that #missingdcgirls is only trending on Twitter but not mass media that could actually get word out to millions of people \n— kolten (@koltenbch) March 24, 2017 Residents are also concerned about the DC Police Department. \nThe list of missing person cases hasn’t been updated, although at least one missing teenager, Chareah Payne, has been found. \nA tweet from the department was sent out, but does not reflect the change. Chareah Payne, pictured above was located by police and is safe but…. @DCPoliceDept hasn't updated the missing persons listings yet. pic.twitter.com/L9NB3ccGep \n— the n. (@blowticious) March 24, 2017 \nNiki Irene, a 32-year old DC resident who works as a crisis placement advocate for survivors of sex trafficking, says the slight lag in updates happens regularly and doesn’t keep the public as informed as they could be. \nShe tells Elite Daily, \nI view the missing persons list a couple of times a week and I’ll notice that it’ll say, ‘current as of’ and it will always be a couple days prior to when I’m looking at it. \nToday, when I was looking at it and it says ‘Current as of 3/22.’ It’s now 3/24. Why do you have people on staff to handle things like that if you’re not going to keep it updated constantly? \nIrene also discussed the toll that underreporting takes on the survivors she works with, saying, A lot of the girls that I work with, they feel ignored and forgotten. They feel like [the media] doesn’t care. Nobody wants to hear about a bunch of poor missing black girls because we are seen as less than. To be clear, none of the missing girls in DC have been linked to sex trafficking, but these survivors provide insight on what it feels like to be missing with few people, if anyone, looking for them. And the media, government agencies and police department do not shoulder all of the blame for the lackadasical attention paid to missing black girls. “Nobody wants to hear about a bunch of poor missing black girls because we are seen as less than.” The general public is responsible, too. Dismissive skepticism and silence on Twitter sit right next to the outrage about the black girls who have gone missing in DC . People have to change their overall attitude towards black girls for missing black girls to matter. \nThere were way too many tweets questioning why we are focusing on black girls , and way too many posts that wrote these missing children off as troublemakers who likely just ran away . \nYes, but missing is missing, no? A child who was kidnapped may sound like a more endearing story, but runaways need help, too. Runaways aren't always \"fast\" or \"think they're grown.\" Sometimes the adults in charge of their care are awful, abusive, and negligent. \n— the n. (@blowticious) March 24, 2017 \nBlack girls are rarely allowed to be victims who feel pain , and when we are, it is rationalized that we deserve it or caused it. \nWhen black girls aren’t blamed, we are ignored altogether — even by groups that declare they are down for our cause. “People have to change their overall attitude towards black girls for missing black girls to matter. ” Where are the white feminists now? You say you're for \"all\" women but show your true colors when one of us needs help #missingdcgirls \n— The Failing Amber M (@HollaBlackGirl) March 24, 2017 \nThe missing girls in DC are also another example of why many black women see feminism as empowerment for only white women, and reject it. \nThis month, we celebrated International Women’s Day with “A Day Without Women.” In January, droves of white feminists, along with women of color, flocked to our nation’s capital to make a statement to the Trump Administration that violence against women and girls is unacceptable. Pink pussy hats and signs in tow. \nNow that black women and girls — who experience sexism and racism in tandem — need help, the majority of people on Twitter making noise are other black women. Business as usual. \nIt is the job of the media, government officials, law enforcement and everyone in between to step up more for marginalized groups like this. \nSilence isn’t going to get any of these missing girls back home safely. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
