Media caption President Trump on US-UK trade talks: \"I'll have to handle it myself, which is OK\" \nOn Thursday Mrs May gave a speech to US Republicans in which she said the UK and US could not again carry out the \"failed\" military interventions of the past \"to remake the world in our own image\". \nSuggesting a UK foreign policy shift, she said those days were over but added that the US and UK should not \"stand idly by when the threat is real\" and should \"lead together again\". \n\"And whether it is the security of Israel in the Middle East or Estonia in the Baltic states, we must always stand up for our friends and allies in democratic countries that find themselves in tough neighbourhoods too,\" she added, to applause from her audience. \nBBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said Mrs May's speech was hugely significant, arguably the biggest by a UK PM in the US since Tony Blair's 1999 speech in Chicago advocating armed interventionism against dictators - something repudiated by Mrs May. Analysis By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg \nLast night Theresa May signalled a turn away from American and British foreign policy of recent years - military interventions into countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. \nBut also, she urged president Trump not to turn America's back on the world, to lead, and to stand up for free trade, not to allow the rise of Asian nations to \"eclipse the West\". \nFor the president who has vowed again and again to put \"America First\", it was certainly an effort to persuade - if not outright criticism. \nYet she also heaped praise on Donald Trump's victory and at home there is queasiness about her new political friendship in some quarters, and scepticism over whether a fair trade deal for the UK with the US could really be achieved as soon as we leave the European Union. \nWell aware of the dangers, Theresa May is nothing if not ambitious for her relationship with her new political friend. 'Engage but beware' \nMrs May's speech followed comments by UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to a House of Lords committee on Thursday that Bashar Assad should be allowed to run for election to remain in power in Syria - a complete reversal of UK foreign policy. \nThe prime minister also spoke in support of Nato - which Mr Trump has called \"obsolete\" and complained that few member states meet their commitments to it - and the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr Trump threatened to scrap during his campaign. \nAnd she said care must be taken to distinguish between \"extreme and hateful ideology\" of Islamist extremism and the \"peaceful religion of Islam and the hundreds of millions of its adherents - including millions of our own citizens and those further afield who are so often the first victims of this ideology's terror\". \nOn dealing with Russia's President Putin, Mrs May said: \"My advice is to engage but beware.\" \n\"We should not jeopardise the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putin's claim that it is now in his sphere of influence,\" she said. Present for the president Image copyright Jeff J Mitchell Image caption One of the most famous quaichs, the Waterloo Tree Quaich, which is in the home of great Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott \nTheresa May will present Donald Trump, whose mother was born in the Outer Hebrides, with an engraved quaich, a Scottish artefact symbolising friendship. \nThe shallow bowls were traditionally used in Scotland from the 17th Century as drinking cups. \nFirst lady Melania gets a hamper of produce from Chequers - containing apple juice, damson jam, marmalade, Bakewell tarts and \"cranberry and white chocolate shorties\". \nThe issue of torture rose up the agenda after the president told ABC News on Wednesday that after he asked intelligence officials if torture \"works\" he was told, \"'Yes, absolutely.'\" \nMrs May has been urged to reject the comments when she meets Mr Trump, and she has suggested that British intelligence sharing could be withdrawn from some operations with the US if it reintroduced torture. \nUnder British law and policy, the UK military and intelligence agencies cannot join operations where someone is being tortured - or officers believe there is a risk that it may happen.
