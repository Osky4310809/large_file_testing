Young scored a game-high 27 points, including two 3-pointers, and seven boards. \nA 6-7 senior forward bound to Butler, Young began the late dunk-off challenge with his team clinging to a five-point lead. \n“We got a little excited there being able to pull away there at the end,” Young said. \nThis victory for Jackson (20-2), the No. 4-ranked team in last week’s final Associated Press state poll , was far from a sure thing. Even when the Bears jumped out to a 17-7 lead, Ellet (18-4) quickly climbed back. \nCharged with 6-9 senior A.J. Gareri , focused outside shooters and home-court advantage, the No. 17-ranked team in the cleveland.com Top 25 led for spurts throughout the second, third and fourth quarters. \nGareri scored 21 points and grabbed nine rebounds. \n“We commended our guys, but we weren’t happy,” Ellet coach Mark Fisher said. “Some transition points there in the end, and we’ve got to stop transition points all of the time. That’s what we talked about after the game.” \nA couple of misses hurt the Orangemen offensively in the final minutes. They led 64-63 before Jackson guard Kyle Nicolas ’ 3-pointer gave his team the lead for good. \n“But you know what?” Fisher said. “We brought it tonight.” \nNicolas hit four 3s and scored 16 points to fuel Jackson’s road win. \nEllet hit eight 3s, including a trio of long shots from Jake Kline off the bench. Senior guard Jaret Jones added two more 3s and 14 points to keep Ellet in contention. \nThe Orangemen are the No. 1 seed for the Division I Alliance District tournament, which they begin Saturday, March 4 with a sectional game against No. 6 Youngstown East or No. 8 Akron East. \nJackson, meanwhile, will be the favorite in a loaded district at Canton. The Bears play a sectional first-round home game Wednesday against 11th-seeded Massillon Perry. \n“To go 20-2 with this group, man it’s been a great year,” Jackson coach Tim Debevec said. “And now our goal is to get to Columbus.” \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
