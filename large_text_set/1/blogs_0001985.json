As you see, it’s also the first time Ohio State has been blanked in a bowl game since 1920, and it’s Meyer’s first ever shutout experienced as a college head coach. It’s their worst shutout loss since USC beat them 32-0 way back in 1947. \nOhio State somewhat controversially got the playoff nod over Big Ten conference champion Penn State despite losing to the Nittany Lions during the regular season, largely because the Buckeyes’ overall resume — featuring just the one loss, whereas Penn State was routed by Michigan and also lost to Pitt — was deemed more impressive. This dud will only fuel the debate the next time such a scenario comes around. \nThe loss was also the Buckeyes’ worst margin of defeat of any kind since losing 35-3 to No. 1 USC early in the 2008 season. \nOuch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T06:11:00.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
