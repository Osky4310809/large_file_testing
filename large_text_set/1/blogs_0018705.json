The retailer first tested out the service in around 50 stores located in Edinburgh and London and has expanded it to 500 stores later on.\nIt looks like the trial was successfully completed, as Tesco has announced that you can now use PayQwiq in every single one of its stores across the UK. The payment service is quite simple to use. Just download the PayQwiq app, add your debit or credit card, and pay for your purchase with the help of your smartphone.\nAccording to Tesco, the service supports all Visa, Mastercard, Amex, and Maestro payment cards. It collects Clubcard points automatically when you make a purchase, which you are then able to see within the app, along with your transactions. The app is secured by a PIN code — four digits — and card details are never stored on your device.\nSee also: LG G6 iris scanner and MST mobile payment rumored again November 25, 2016 One PayQwiq account can be used on two different smartphones at once and there is a limit of £250 per transaction, which is higher when compared to a contactless credit/debit card. But keep in mind that the service doesn’t work on rooted phones.\nMobile payment services are getting more popular by the day, and retailers want in on the action. Tesco is not the only one that is entering the game, as we have seen others release their own mobile payment services as well. One of them is the US-based Walmart, which took the wraps off the Scan & Go app for Android a couple of weeks ago.\nInterested in trying out Tesco’s mobile payment service? Visit the Google Play Store by clicking the button below and download the PayQwiq app to your device.\nDownload PayQwiq ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T17:01:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
