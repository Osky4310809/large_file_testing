Brent Council’s ground breaking approach rescues an opportunity for pupils to communally explore and forge shared values, in a way that is workable and respectful. \n“We hope all other local authorities will take inspiration from Brent Council’s approach, which we highly commend.” poll loading Should school assemblies include Christian worship? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO \nAndrea Williams, chief executive of Christian Concern, said of the Brent decision: \"I think it is a shame. \n“The whole point of Christian assemblies is that they recognise that our education service is rooted in Christianity and founded by Christians. \n“Bringing in different beliefs into assemblies means you could end up with an act of worship that says nothing.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:22:26.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
