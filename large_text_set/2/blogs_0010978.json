It’s a fair bet we’d see sackings and prosecutions, the offenders finding themselves out of jobs and up before the magistrates. \nThrowing the book at bosses caught breaking the law by failing to pay the legal minimum would soon have others behaving better. \nAdministrative errors by companies are mistakes the low-paid are unable to see the funny side of. And if employers take great care not to overpay, let’s stop them underpaying.
