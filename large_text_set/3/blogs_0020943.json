Hit the jump for more details on the Venom movie release date.\n\n \nLast we heard Sony hired Dante Harper to write the script for Venom , which was envisioned as a potential franchise-starter. And at that time we were told that the film would standalone completely “apart from and unrelated to” the upcoming Spider-Man movies featuring Holland. No word on if anything has changed on that front but as it sounds like Venom isn’t joining Spidey in the MCU as Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach will produce this film.\nSony has made repeated attempts to make a Venom spinoff for years now. During the tail end of the Sam Raimi / Tobey Maguire Spider-man era they hoped to launch a spin-off franchise. Venom made his first big-screen appearance in 2007’s Spider-Man 3 , where he was played by Topher Grace.\nWhen a Spider-Man cinematic universe was planned during the Marc Webb / Andrew Garfield Spider-Man era, Venom was one of the properties being developed. Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese ( Deadpool ) took a crack at the script, as has Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci ( The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ). Gary Ross and Josh Trank were attached to direct at various points. But of course, Sony decided to reboot the character as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nTom Holland . made his debut appearance as Peter Parker aka Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War, and will be appearing in his own standalone movie Spider-Man: Homecoming, which hits theaters in July. Holland is expected to reprise his role in at least two more Spider-Man films, in addition to Marvel’s epic crossover Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers 4.\nHarper’s screenwriting resume includes the upcoming American remake of Sleepless Night , Tommy Wirkola’s Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters , and rewrite work on Edge of Tomorrow .\nThe post ‘Venom’ Movie Release Date Announced: Sony Dates Spider-Man Spin-Off appeared first on /Film .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:15:52.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
