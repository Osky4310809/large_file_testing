But at 2.10am on that fateful Saturday, she called triple 0 with intense contractions. \n“She met us at the door (of her home) and the way she was presenting we knew we had to get her there pretty quickly, but on the way things changed and we had to pull over and deliver there on the roadside,” NSW Ambulance officer Chris Farrell said. \nJust 20 minutes later, she gave birth to her third child, baby boy Kaizer, in the back of an ambulance on the side of Richmond Rd. \n“I just kept telling Kaizer ‘we did it, we did it’,” Ms Ellis said. \nMr Farrell said it was rare for paramedics to deliver a baby. \n“It’s pretty rare — we get usually get to women in labour but it’s rare to actually deliver them,” he said. “That was the second time I had delivered and I’ve had one since, so three all up. I’ve been (a paramedic) for four years.” media_camera Penrith's Kirsten Shepherd and son Gannon with NSW Ambulance’s Bianca Jackson.

Picture: Justin Sanson \nMeanwhile, 32-year-old Whalan mother Monique Jensen was at home when her labour with her fifth child, Shylah-Rain, was intensified. \n“I could feel contractions starting at 2am in the morning and they were reasonably early stages of labour,” Ms Jensen said. \n“About 9am I rang my mum. She came over and we rang the hospital at 10am and they said no you’re not ready yet you’ve got plenty of time. Call back at noon. She was born at 11.48am.” \nMs Jensen was in her loungeroom surrounded by towels, pillows, her mother and neighbours and being watched by tradies who were renovating the house across the street. \n“My main worry was not having a doctor,” she said. “I was so worried if something went wrong. At 11.38am I made the call to the paramedics and she was born at 11.48am.” \nCall taker Chris Lewis said: “It was a real family and neighbourly affair. \n“I had a neighbour on the phone that I guided through the process and her sons did a great job getting stuff ready and waiting outside for the ambulance and bringing towels and a blanket. It progressed very very quickly. We don’t see them progress that quickly. \n“You never forget that first cry. I’ve delivered 13 babies and that’s what we’re straining to here over the phone because if you hear that all’s well.” media_camera Monique Jensen and Brittany Ellis swap stories with Chris Lewis and Chris Farrell at Tregear Reserve. Picture: Justin Sanson \nDespite all the commotion, Ms Jensen said the first thing she did after giving birth was thank her mum. \n“I feel my mum is champion. Even though I was the one in pain, the nervous wreck and pushing — I wouldn’t have known what to do if she wasn’t there.” \nAmbulance call-takers assisted a total of 142 of the 320 out of hospital births last year. Paramedics delivered 94 of those births while 23 mums gave birth on the side of the road, including 10 in an ambulance. \nMr Lewis had one piece of advise for any mum who finds themselves in an out-of-hospital delivery situation. \n“Call us straight away. If you think there’s the remotest possibility there’s something happening. Don’t try to drive. If you’re in a car its much harder.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T08:25:42.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
