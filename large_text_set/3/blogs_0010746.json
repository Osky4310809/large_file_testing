Share Click   Scott Disick Breaks Down over Kourtney Kardashian: 'I'm a Sex Addict!' Share this video Get   \nKourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick's strained relationship was laid bare in the first episode of the new series of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. \nThe mum-of-three admits she doesn't mind spending time with Scott when they're a family - but she can't stand being around him in social situations. \nAnd it becomes clear just moments into the latest episode as the pair squabble over nothing during a dinner with Khloe Kardashian and friends in Miami back in September. \n\"I really do enjoy hanging out with Scott and the kids because we know what we're doing,\" Kourt initially admits in a confessional. \n\"When we’re out socially I just don’t know how to act. For so many years I’ve been used to playing a certain role and having to be responsible and watching out for his behaviour.

What else could they be? The past?\" an animated Scott hits back. \nLater in the episode, Kourtney makes it clear she doesn't want Scott at Kim's assistant's birthday celebrations, despite him texting both Kim and Khloe while they're sat down to dinner.

Scott and Kourt aren’t together but it has to be hard because they have all the same friends. \n\"[It] just blurs a lot of lines. We don’t know what we’re allowed to invite him too… I don’t want to be lying to Scott. It’s a weird, f**ked up situation - not just for me but for everyone at the table.\" \nScott later tells Kim he's not going to go to Kanye's concert that night, but Kim tells Kourtney she should invite him. (Photo: E!) \n\"Scott text me saying he didn’t want to come to the concert tonight just because he wanted to give you your space. I feel like he’s shutting himself off because he doesn’t want to feel like he’s stepping on your toes, and I feel bad. \nBut Kourt doesn't care, hitting back: \"No, you can’t feel bad for him. He’s invited to everything and I can’t breathe.\" \n\"I get it but you can’t change what you do when he’s there, so you just have to live your life. You lived his life.\" \nThe mum-of-three eventually calls her ex and convinces him to come to the show after all. \nAnd later in the episode the pair appear to iron out their differences after sitting down for a heart to heart. (Photo: E!) \n\"So I feel like overall Miami was good, but I feel like it was kind of awkward sometimes,\" Scott tells his ex back home in Los Angeles. \n\"I think it’s more awkward in social environments. Day-to-day.\" \n\"But that’s the problem,\" Scott replies. \"You and I are somewhat best friends every day but then when it goes into a social place neither of us really know how to act and it just becomes uncomfortable. Is there a solution to this?\" (Photo: E!) \nKourtney looks unsure and tells him she worries about her actions setting him off since he's been doing so well lately. \n\"I don’t want you to have to feel anxious or guilty. There was a time in our life when your actions would affect me. Now I'm older and realise with all the responsibility I have to take on - no offence to you - but no matter what you do I can’t change my life over it for the worse.\" Kourtney, Khloe and Kim Kardashian hit Miami. The trio stopped off at their clothing store Dash, Miami, Florida. (Photo: Splash) \nThe mum tells him she doesn't think they need to do stuff together \"24/7\". \n\"I was trying to give you your space to have your own fun on your own terms too,\" Scott replies. \n\"I guess we both need to do our thing without us being together. I feel like maybe there are times you want to run around with your girlfriends and don’t want your ex-boyfriend to be there. \n\"And if I’m hitting the strip I probably don’t want you rolling. So knock yourself out, kid,\" he quips. \n\"Oh yeah, buckle your seatbelt,\" the mum-of-three replies. \nTo camera, Kourtney adds: \"I'm happy Scott is bringing this up. Communicating is something we’re not good at at together. I think it’s going to be a constant process to figure out how to live life parenting out kids, being a family but not being together.\" (Photo: E! Entertainment) \nMeanwhile, in next week's teaser, Kim opens up about the scary incident which saw armed thieves escape with jewellery worth around £8.7m. \nThe preview starts with the sisters and Kris Jenner jetting into the French Capital for Fashion Week last October. \n“Oh my god I cannot wait for Paris Fashion Week!” Kim gushes. \nBut just moments later a French voice cuts in: \"911 speaking good evening. What is your emergency?\" (Photo: E! Entertainment) \nSpeaking to camera, a teary Kim reveals: “I just said, 'Please - I have a family - let me live.'\" \nIt then cuts to Kim and her sisters sitting on the sofa. \n\"They’re either going to shoot me in the back or if the elevator does not open in time, I’m f**ked. There’s no way out,\" the reality star sobs. (Photo: FameFlynet) \nAlthough 17 arrests have been made following the robbery, only a handful of people have been charged and none of the items stolen from Kim, 36, including two Cartier diamond bracelets, a Jacob necklace in gold inlaid with diamonds, earrings with diamonds by Loraine Schwarz, a necklace by Loraine Schwarz with diamonds and a diamond ring worth $4 million, have been returned to her. \nKeeping Up With The Kardashians is available now in the UK & Ireland on hayu & 19th March at 9pm on E!
