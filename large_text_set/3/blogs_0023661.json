He joins top Administration officials to mingle with the ultra-rich at his ‘Winter White House' and won't say who paid $200,000 for the privilege. ” \nWhitehouse suggests that if the Trump administration refuses to publish the visitor logs, Congress should require them. \n“ If he won't adopt that policy himself, Congress should require it ,\" Whitehouse says. \nTrump was criticized by Democrats for having an open-air meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the first month of his presidency. \nTrump, who repeatedly criticized Obama for taking too many vacations, has already made a total of five trips to Mar-a-Lago, and 11 trips to the golf course in just over eight weeks since he became president. Trump today made his 11th trip a Trump-owned golf course in 8 weeks as president.Here are his previous tweets about presidents and golf: pic.twitter.com/bSINMTc4Mh — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 19, 2017 \nIt is unlikely that the MAR-A-LAGO Act will become law, since it has to pass through a Republican-controlled Congress and be signed by Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T06:31:41.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
