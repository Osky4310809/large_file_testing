Police say Wallen was wanted for his involvement in a mail fraud scheme with a Federal Criminal Complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney for Maryland. \nPolice say the body of a Lutherville man was found Sunday by hikers in a heavily wooded area of the Loch Raven Reservoir. \nPolice at the time found a suicide note at his home, and they found his silver Jeep near the intersection of Old Bosley and Dulaney Valley roads. An extensive search by BCoPD revealed no trace of Wallen, however. \nPolice say Wallen’s body was found at least a mile from where police had found his vehicle almost a year ago, in a heavily wooded area east of Dulaney Valley Road, about a half-mile from the Villa Maria School. \nPolice say Wallen’s death is a presumed suicide, though the Office of the State Medical Examiner has not yet ruled on the cause and manner of death. Investigators do not suspect foul play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:27:36.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
