And it went off. \nIt was learned that he sustained injury in his hand, just as stray bullets hit Mrs. Okpa, who was standing nearby. \nBoth of them were immediately rushed to the Villa clinic for first aid treatment, before they were transferred to the State House Hospital, Asokoro. \nThere were fears that bullets were still lodged in Mrs. Okpa’s body. \nAlthough it could not be ascertained whether the operative was attached to the Villa or to a minister, unconfirmed report had it that he was not on duty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T12:48:23.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
