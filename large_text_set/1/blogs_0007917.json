Given that we follow Pitch Perfect rumors like children trying to escape a witch, this is a sizable breadcrumb.Kendrick dropped a pitch perfect Instagram chock full of Barden Bellas. Those Bellas include Kendrick herself, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Chrissie Fit, and Ester Dean. That's a lot of star power.
