Love!” \nThe man who is about to become President of the United States continues to exhibit a mean-spirited, thin-skinned, narcissistic and vindictive character. \nTrump sees the world in terms of personal wins or losses, enemies or friends, supporters or critics. \nHe hasn’t yet figured out that a president holds a position of public trust that transcends personal animus. A president is supposed to represent all Americans, including those who voted against him and may continue to oppose him. \nIn a democracy, those who fight against a president’s policies are not his personal enemies; they are political opponents and critics. A democracy depends on the freedom to oppose those in power, without fear of reprisal, without being denigrated or labeled an enemy. \n\nHappy New Year, Mr. Trump. You have 20 days in which to learn how to act as a president. All of us – even those who oppose your policies and worry about your character – sincerely hope you do. \nRobert B.
