Those players are long gone. wingz101 says: Jan 5, 2017 11:36 AM \nIn the GB game I will take the QB with the better defense and the better WR group: Eli. One thing I found interesting in the Packers-Detroit game was that Darius Slay was very effective taking out Jordy Nelson. The rest of the Packer WRs just were better that Detroits MASH unit and Detroit had no pass rush. The Giants on the other hand have a very strong DB group, a pash rush and GB can‚Äôt run the ball. NYGs is a bad match-up for the Pack.

It was a combination of the REST of the team stepping it up and oodles of luck (including quite a bit of questionable officiating in 2007 and the 49ers grossly outplaying the Giants in 2011 but getting edged out in a worse-case scenario of tons of turnovers, Manning throwing an INT that was so bad that two 49ers had it easily but collided, and Bradshaw fumbling but having it not ruled a fumble). Manning didn‚Äôt mess it up, so there is that, but that‚Äôs a far cry from being some kind of postseason savior. bullcharger says: Jan 5, 2017 11:50 AM \nThe Giants are getting way too much credit this year. They can‚Äôt score any points! OBJ is a great player, but he‚Äôs one guy! If GB get 20 the game is over. LyinRogerMustGo says: Jan 5, 2017 11:50 AM \nLions over Seahags.

Eli LED the Giants though the playoffs and to wins over the mighty Pats. You don‚Äôt put up top 10 all time stats if you are an average QB. Eli is the Rodney Dangerfield of the NFL because everyone wants to compare him to his big brother. I‚Äôd take Eli in January over any other QB.
