"Manchester United transfer rumours: James, Bakayoko, Semedo, Schneiderlin, Depay, Evra Staff writers, FOX SPORTS January 9, 2017 1:58pm \nJAMES tells Manchester United to sign him from Real Madrid, the three-way Premier League battle for a starlet, and the latest on Memphis Depay and Morgan Schneiderlin. \nCatch up on the latest Red Devils transfer rumours! \nGOSSIP: Arsenal circle $92m striker as Sanchez suitors lurk \nJAMES TELLS UNITED “COME GET ME” \nReal Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez has told Manchester United to “come and get me”, according to The Mirror. \nThe Colombian playmaker, who was signed from Monaco for a reported $115m in 2014, has fallen out of favour under manager Zinedine Zidane, and Old Trafford is reportedly his preferred destination if he leaves the Bernabeu. \nThe 25-year-old’s agent Jorge Mendes is reportedly in talks with United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward over a move, but other interested clubs such as Chelsea and PSG could challenge for his signature. \nHowever, James is still remaining coy on a move. After scoring in a rare start in a midweek Copa del Rey match against Sevilla, he said: “Real Madrid is the club I dreamed about.” media_camera Real Madrid's Colombian midfielder James Rodriguez. \nUNITED V CITY V CHELSEA FOR BAKAYOKO \nWhile James would provide United another attacking option in midfield, Jose Mourinho is reportedly also looking to strengthen his defensive midfield. \nAccording to Daily Record, the Red Devils are locked in a three-way battle with Manchester City and Chelsea to sign Monaco holding midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko. \nOriginally Monaco reportedly didn’t want to part with their 22-year-old Frenchman in January, but after growing interest in the player, the club has reportedly reconsidered their position. \nThe Ligue 1 side values Bakayoko at a minimum of €25 million ($35m), which seemingly wouldn’t be an issue for United after they bought Anthony Martial from Monaco for €80 million. media_camera Monaco's French midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko. \nUNITED v BAYERN FOR $57M DEFENDER \nUnited’s move for defender Victor Lindelof is reportedly inching closer to being complete after his former club Vasteras agreed to take a smaller percentage of his reported £38m transfer fee. \nBut Mourinho hasn’t given up on also signing his teammate Nelson Semedo , according to O Jogo. \nThe Red Devils have been monitoring the Portugal defender, but will be challenged by Bayern Munich to sign the $57 million-rated player, who has a buyout clause of $85m. \nThe Bundesliga giant could be looking to strengthen their defence after defender Holger Badstuber was linked with a move to Manchester City or Swansea. media_camera Benfica's defender Nelson Semedo (top). \nEVERON MUST PAY MORE FOR SCHNEIDERLIN \nMourinho has said that midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin can leave Old Trafford so long as an acceptable bid is made. So far that hasn’t happened. \nAccording to The Mail, United are unwilling to sell the Frenchman to Everton unless they make an offer or more than £20 million. \nToffees manager Ronald Koeman reportedly wants the deal to happen but the club hasn’t made an offer over that benchmark. \nUnited are refusing to sell the midfielder for less than £20m because they bought him from Southampton for £24m just 18 months ago. media_camera Morgan Schneiderlin (L). \nDEPAY COULD GET ANOTHER CHANCE AT UNITED \nMemphis Depay has also been linked with a move to Everton, but AC Milan also want him according to Calciomercato. \nHowever, the Italian giant reportedly can’t afford to sign him permanently, and would only be able to take him on loan. \nBut the Dutchman could also try and win another opportunity at Old Trafford. \nMourinho said he is open to keeping the 22-year-old winger at United, but won’t stop him leaving if he wants to depart. \n“I was informed by the club that there is a chance Memphis could leave,” Mourinho told Fox Sports. “From a human point of view, I cannot stop him from leaving when he is not playing under me. \n“If he is staying, I would be more than happy because he is a fantastic guy and a very good player. I feel so sorry that I am not giving him opportunities to play. A player of his age needs to be playing matches. \n“If he stays with me, for sure, he will play some games because we have so many matches.” media_camera Manchester United's Dutch midfielder Memphis Depay (R). \nEVRA UNCERTAINTY \nFormer United left-back Patrice Evra was left out of Juventus’ squad for their 3-0 victory over Bolonga due to uncertainty over his future. \nThe 35-year-old has fallen out of favour under manager Massimiliano Allegri. \nBrazilian Alex Sandro has emerged as Allegri’s first-choice full-back, but after an injury, Andrea Barzagli was awarded the starting spot instead of Evra. \nJuve chief executive Giuseppe Marotta has confirmed Evra was left out as he could leave the club this month. \n“Evra was not called up to the squad because he’s thinking about his future,” Marotta told Sky Italia. “If he leaves, we will not sign a replacement. media_camera Juventus' Patrice Evra (R). \n“It’s only right he’s taking a moment to reflect, as his contract will expire in June, he is 35 going towards 36. We’ll see next week. \n“I don’t think we need to find a replacement, as we have internal options like Kwadwo Asamoah and Federico Mattiello.” \nEvra has been linked with a to La Liga club Valencia, but his agent Federico Pastorello said, “It’s not certain he will leave Juventus. We’ll see what happens over the next few days.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:17:46.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
