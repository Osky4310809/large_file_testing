Jibrin, a former Chairman, House Committee on Appropriation, claimed on Saturday that Ibori donated the money to Dogara’s campaign from prison in 2015 to support his bid to become the speaker. The suspended lawmaker claimed in a statement that he chose to be silent lately to strategise on his crusade in the new year. The statement read in part, “The propaganda and lies spread around lately by the axis of evil in the House of Representatives to water down my popularity shows how desperate Dogara has become. It is such a shame that Dogara denied that former governor James Ibori provided huge support to his emergence as speaker by mobilising members from Delta State and others from the South-South and South-East zones to support him. “Since he has disowned Ibori, he should at least have the honour to return the $600,000 Ibori donated to his speakership campaign. I am sure he cannot deny the fact that he collected that money in cash.” However, when contacted, the Special Adviser to Dogara on Media and Public Affairs, Turaki Hassan, referred our correspondent to an earlier statement that denied such allegation. SUNDAY PUNCH’s findings indicated that Jibrin might have returned to the trenches after a reported move to broker peace between him and Dogara collapsed. Jibrin was reported to have engaged some lawmakers to broker the peace. As part of the efforts, he was reportedly advised to send a congratulatory message to Dogara who turned 49 recently. In the message, Jibrin wished Dogara “Many prosperous years ahead; God’s guidance and abundant blessings.” It was gathered that the Kano lawmaker did not receive any positive reaction from the Speaker’s camp after the message.   \nHe may be a thief, but there is truth in his statement. Nnamdi \nAtiku does not even know what he believes in. Over the years he has been so inconsistent. It is only in a place like Nigeria where the past is easily forgotten that is where inconsistent people like this will be relevant Ayodeji \nBut he is better than stupid Jonathan. Olusegun Adekoya \nExplain how he is better and hoe how Jonathan is stupid. A lot of you uncivilised critics are walking around with eyes wide shut and cannot see progress even if it hits you in the face. So who is d saviour you are are clamouring for? Is it lord Tinubu or emperor Buhari. Omotolaaraujo \nThey might be an improvement from King Goodluck. OYEDIRAN A. \nmy brother, it bring shame and makes my heart blicks when i listen and read post from my people that says even if they are thieves,or have loot the nation and the region they have govern before dry, since they are my fore forward man from my region, they should should take power, and continue looting ,but accuses the Gov. of the day of corruption, sometimes i wonder is this ignorance or we have been bewitch and brainwash by these politician, God shall deliver this nation from the power that takes people consciousness of reality from people. Innocent \nSwallow it please! Any other person(including, Shekau of Boko Haram) maybe better, but definitely not Atiku which looted Nigeria with Obj, yet we welcomed him to ACN thinking he would change and do Nigeria good but he went again to disappoint us once more. \nAbeg, distance yourself from Atiku and mention another person. Jeff \nits idiots like you that diminish the value of constructive criticism on this page ayobamiba \nAtiku was a vice President for 8 years and after 8 years, atiku was declared to be a thief by his oga at the top Obj .so atiku after looting Nigeria has turned a preacher,wonders shall never end .if atiku has been sincere ,there would not have been this scenerio where an unfit yaradua was foisted on Nigeria because atiku would have graduated from vice President to the President and that would have saved Nigeria this trauma.that arose from the pain of the north been shortchanged at d presidency. armrod \nWhere does Atiku belong? I heard that Tinubu refused to accept him back to APC. He has been relegated to the background not in APC nor PDP and he has denied of being a member of PDM. May be he will join APGA stanley \nIf you say Jonathan is stupid then what will you say of buhari that had been hunting Ibb for years and now the are best of friends trying to form the so call alaye peoples Congress APC as a party who is stupid. Or what do u have to say about atiku who is just like a pendulum. Ayekooto \nWho is this Leprosy Gehazi called Atiku which no party want? denzze \nAtiku have been grounded by OBJ. Atiku is like a prostitute who wears an ugly face & no customer is ready to petronise.u beta remain in ur political oblivion or else nigerians will revisite halibotin scandal. sola \nAtiku in Yoruba means someone that had been mercilessly beaten.The man is politically drone. let him alone Latest Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T02:07:53.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
