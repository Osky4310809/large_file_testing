And here’s one that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face: Six-year-old Jimmy Spagnolo has been battling a brain tumor since he was a baby, but after undergoing a brutal year of chemotherapy, his doctors at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center told him his tumor has shrunk to the point where he might not need any more treatment. After hearing the amazing news, Spagnolo—who, it should be noted, was decked out in a badass Superman outfit at the time—was so stoked that he rang the ceremonial bell and wildly danced around in celebration. The video is below, and you’ll love it. \nThe University Of Pittsburgh Medical Center posted the clip with the comment, “The bell signifies so many emotions—it can signify the sound of tears, strength, fear, courage, doubt, satisfaction, relief, and happiness all coming through as one as people around them cheer this accomplishment.” And the people around young Jimmy in the video—including his mom, Lacie—certainly felt the weight of the moment. “To share moments like these and feel the connection in the room with everyone is electrifying,” Lacie wrote on Jimmy’s Facebook page .
