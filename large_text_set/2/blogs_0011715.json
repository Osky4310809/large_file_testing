What's happened to give our hero such a hopeful look? We run down the biggest moments from episode 9, \"Rock in the Road.\" PHOTOS: TV's 10 Most Shocking Deaths of the 2015-2016 Season \nFrustration at the Hilltop \nLet's get the bummer news out of the way first: for the time being, Gregory ( Xander Berkeley ) is still top dog at the Hilltop colony, and he's still being a complete butthead about it. When Rick and the rest of the Alexandrians suggested they team up to topple the Saviors once and for all, Gregory's response was a resounding, condescending \"nope\" (and a poignant reminder that this guy cannot suffer an unfortunate disembowelment at the hands of a rogue walker soon enough). However, a handful of folks at the Hilltop offered to join up, anyway, bringing Rick's numbers up by … five. Hey, it's something. PHOTOS: The Walking Dead Cast: What They Look Like on the Red Carpet \nAn Audience With the King \nStill trying to raise an army, Rick's next stop was the Kingdom, where Jesus (Tom Payne) introduced the group to King Ezekiel ( Khary Payton ). Rick made quite the plea for help in battling their common enemy, telling a super-cool and setting-appropriate fairytale that just happened to perfectly illustrate his point. But despite that — and the fact that Ezekiel's closest advisers, Richard ( Karl Makinen ) and Benjamin ( Logan Miller ), were keen on an alliance — the King said nay. But with Daryl ( Norman Reedus ) left behind at the Kingdom with instructions to glare at Ezekiel 'til he changes his mind, let's not be royally disappointed just yet.
