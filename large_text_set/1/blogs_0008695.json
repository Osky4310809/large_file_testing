The car has been repositioned at the very heart of the ultra-competitive European B-hatchback segment. \nConceived, designed and engineered with those customers' requirements at the top of the agenda, Nissan has a clear ambition for the new Micra; it should re-establish itself inside the top 10 sellers in the segment, and compete head-to-head with the best and most popular in the class. Benchmarked against key rivals, Nissan believes the all-new Nissan Micra meets and exceeds its targets. \nKey to its appeal is the car's athletic and expressive exterior design, which moves the Micra name plate in a daring new direction. The contemporary look and premium feel continues inside, with a high-quality cabin that boasts two-tone soft-touch materials as standard across the range. Thanks to outstanding packaging, the five-door-only body shell boasts best-in-class ergonomics for front seat occupants, with no compromise to rear passenger space. The boot is big enough to easily cater for customers' needs. \nThe all-new Nissan Micra is also a technology leader, with a number of 'in-control' features - the sort usually associated with more expensive models - now available for the first time. Not only are they new to the Nissan Micra, they're new to the segment. These include Intelligent Lane Intervention, a safety system which gently corrects the Micra back on to the right path should it be required. \nNissan's acclaimed Intelligent Around View Monitor camera system - as seen on the Qashqai and Juke crossovers - is also available on the Micra for the first time. These and other technologies are a clear demonstration of Nissan Intelligent Mobility, the brand's vision for a zero emissions and zero fatalities future. 2017 Nissan Micra \nFor music fans, a highlight of the new Micra will be the BOSE Personal audio system. Unique to the B-hatchback segment, advanced speakers built into the driver's head rest put the driver at the heart of the listening experience. \nThe all-new Nissan Micra is also a fantastic car to drive, with a dynamic performance that is the perfect balance between agility, excitement and the secure feeling that comes with confident and predictable handling. \nThe car is available with three downsized engines - two petrol and one diesel - all linked to a five-speed manual gearbox. Nissan's familiar five grades of Visia, Visia+, Acenta, N-Connecta and Tekna all feature a high level of standard specification. \nCustomers' desires to express their own personalities and design tastes through the new Micra will be another part of its appeal. The car will be available with a wide range of personalisation options, modifying the exterior and interior with premium components in a variety of stylish and contemporary colours. \nNissan's brand promise - Innovation that Excites - is evident in every part of the new Micra, and nowhere is that more obvious than with Nissan Intelligent Get&Go. It's a shared vehicle leasing scheme that is running as a pilot in Paris during 2017 and, if successful, will be extended to other countries. \nIt's also clear evidence of how the customer is at the centre of this latest chapter in the Micra success story. Intelligent Get&Go provides increased access to the new Nissan Micra through its innovative digital partnering of consumers. This allows them to benefit from great value leasing rates which are fully aligned to their motoring requirements. \nGuillaume Cartier, Senior Vice President Sales & Marketing at Nissan Europe, commented: \"We have taken the European compact car segment to a new level by focusing on what customers really want today and expect tomorrow. The all-new Nissan Micra is an exceptional car, characterised by its expressive design, uplifting interior and confident drive.\" \nHe added: \"There is so much affection in Europe for the Micra, clearly demonstrated by more than three decades of heritage and more than 3.5 million sales. It was famously the first Japanese model to win the European Car of the Year title in 1993.\" \nThe 2017 European Car of the Year is very much on the radar for the new Micra, with the car having been selected as one of the seven finalist models. The winner will be announced at the Geneva Motor Show on 7 March. \nOrder books for the all-new Nissan Micra opened in key markets in December 2016 and in the rest of Europe from January 2017. First customer deliveries are expected in March/April 2017, depending on the market. \nAll-new Nissan Micra: reinventing an iconic model \nThe Nissan Micra has 34 years of history and sales success in Europe. First launched in 1983, it is one of Europe's most recognisable car model names. It is also much-loved by the car-buying public, with an outstanding level of customer loyalty over its lifetime. More than seven million units have been sold worldwide since launch, with more than 3.5 million of those in Europe. \nThe all-new Nissan Micra is the fifth generation, and a priority from the very beginning was to put the customer at the heart of the project. Focus groups and clinics created a foundation for what the car should be - a no-compromise package which clearly answered the needs of European small car buyers. \nExpressive design \nThe new Nissan Micra has dynamic hatchback proportions, and with an overall length of 3,999 mm it's placed right at the core of the B-hatchback segment. Featuring a sculpted body with strong and sharp character lines visible from every angle, the car delivers an athletic and poised stance that's hard to ignore. \nBut it's not just great to look at; the new Micra has a best-in-class drag coefficient of just 0.29, to maximise fuel efficiency. \nAvailable only as a five-door model, the car is longer, lower and wider than ever before. The wheelbase is also longer. The new Micra is the widest model in the B-hatchback segment and among the lowest. \nFrom the front, the shortened bonnet design and reduced A-pillar angle create an athletic silhouette. The narrow headlamps stretch through the front wings and include signature LED daytime running lights on every trim level. Halogen headlamps are standard on all grades, with full LED lighting available as an option. As well as adding to the expressive look of the car, they are more energy efficient and offer improved visibility. The lights frame Nissan's familiar 'V-motion' grille, reinterpreted to complete the new Micra's bold front-end design - now including the new 'flat-finish' Nissan badge. \nIn profile, the car's sloping roof line is clearly visible. Below it is the expressive character line which runs the entire length of the new Nissan Micra's body, dipping dramatically as it passes over the front door and sweeping upwards towards the rear. The black B and C-pillars create a floating roof effect, while the C-pillar is home to the discrete door handles which provide access for rear passengers. \nAt the rear are the striking new boomerang-shaped light clusters. Below them is the sculpted bumper which features a carbon-look finish as standard and hides the car's exhaust pipe. Above is the sports-style rear roof spoiler, also standard to enhance aerodynamic performance. Together these features create a recognisable motif for the back of the car. \nThe new Micra is available in 10 body colours. The solid finishes are Ivory and White, with Platinum Silver, Gunmetal Grey and Enigma Black available as standard metallic finishes. The 'character' metallic colours are Energy Orange, Passion Red, Pulse Green and Power Blue, and are expected to be among the most popular choices with customers. Glaze White is the single pearlescent option. \nThree of the colours - Energy Orange, Pulse Green and Passion Red - are unique to Micra, with the latter using an innovative 'tinted clear coat' technology for a truly vibrant finish. This is another first for the brand. \nThe exterior of the new Micra can be further enhanced with a number of personalisation elements. \nUplifting interior \nThe interior of the new Micra has been carefully created to put the customer at the heart of the experience. The cabin is based around a T-shaped 'gliding wing' dashboard, with simple and harmonious structures that create excellent space for the driver and front passenger. The instruments and controls have been grouped together for comfort, convenience and safety. Benchmarking against rivals means Nissan believes the new Micra has best-in-class 'eyes off the road' time. \nLevels of refinement and the highest perceived quality were a top priority for the development team, expressed through the use of two-tone and soft-touch materials as standard on every grade of Micra. Premium detailing includes the D-shaped multi-function steering wheel - also standard equipment - and chrome finishing on the door handles and air vents. \nOutstanding ergonomics was another development target on the new Micra - a target that was achieved. The car sets new standards in the B-hatchback segment thanks to its smart packaging. A rake/reach-adjustable steering wheel is standard, while the lowered seating position for driver and front passenger mean there's exceptional headroom for taller occupants. \nCoupled with class-leading fore/aft driver's seat adjustment, it means a driver who is 2.03 metres (6 ft 8 ins) can fit comfortably behind the wheel. Nissan knows this as it has one in the Micra development team! Similarly, there's a female employee who is just 1.52 (4 ft 11 ins) who is also perfectly at home in the new Micra. \nThe specially designed front seats provide continuous back support, helping to decrease driver fatigue on long journeys. The car's increased width compared with the preceding model means enhanced elbow space for rear passengers, who also benefit from best-in-class shoulder and knee room. \nBoot capacity is a very competitive 300 litres (VDA), and delivered without compromising on rear passenger knee room. That figure expands to 1,004 litres when the 60:40 split rear seats are folded down. \nSmart storage options are everywhere in the new Nissan Micra's cabin, with location, capacity and design all optimised to ensure maximum convenience for occupants. Larger items can be placed in the centre console ahead of the gear selector. It offers flat storage for a phone, and includes ambient lighting plus USB and 12v sockets. \nThe 10-litre glove box has been specifically shaped to take a two-litre drinks bottle, while bottles up to 1.5 litres will fit in the front door bins. Additionally, there are two cupholders between the front seats, plus another in the rear. For driver comfort, air-conditioning is standard on all but the entry level model, with automatic air-conditioning available on the higher grades. \nThe interior of the new Micra can be further enhanced with a number of personalisation elements. \nBOSE Personal premium audio system \nThe new Nissan Micra is equipped with a wide range of intuitive 'in-control' technologies designed to enhance the car's comfort, convenience and safety performance. Many of them are standard across the range, while others are available from specific grades or as an option. \nA first for the B-hatchback segment is the BOSE Personal premium audio system, which offers a 360Ëpersonal listening experience thanks to two speakers located in the driver's seat head rest. \nThe BOSE Personal system has just six speakers - the others are in the front doors and the A-pillars - but, thanks to the efforts of BOSE and Nissan engineers working together, it's a case of quality over quantity. \nThe system is unique to Micra and has been specially tuned to create the best possible sound inside the cabin. It uses a powerful lightweight digital amplifier hidden under the driver's seat, creating a wide and immersive soundstage without the need for a space-filling bass speaker. BOSE Premium audio is standard on Tekna, and an option on Acenta and N-Connecta grades. \nNissanConnect \nCustomers control many of the new Micra's features using the infotainment system, located high up in the centre of the dashboard. NissanConnect is the name given to the most advanced of these. It is standard on Tekna and N-Connecta grades, and optional on Acenta. The standard infotainment system on Acenta is called Display Audio, while Visia+ and Visia get the entry level system (optional on Visia). \nNissanConnect offers a 7-inch full-colour multi-touch display, DAB digital radio, satellite navigation and smartphone-style apps. \nDisplay Audio also has a 7-inch full-colour multi-touch display, and comes with Apple CarPlay as standard. When an Apple iPhone is connected via an Apple lightning cable it offers users Siri voice control, Apple maps with turn-by-turn navigation, plus access to music, telephone services and other apps such as Audiobooks and Spotify. \nComplementing the audio unit is the advanced driver-assist display, located in the combimeter between the two dials in the instrument cluster. Positioned to minimise 'eyes off the road' time, it uses a high-definition five-inch TFT colour display to provide the driver with key information about the car and journey. It's based on technology which Nissan developed for the Qashqai and X-Trail crossovers, and is controlled using dedicated steering wheel buttons. \nA comprehensive range of safety technologies \nThe new Micra features the most comprehensive suite of integrated safety technologies ever offered on a Nissan small car. They include: Intelligent Lane Intervention. This is a lane departure warning and prevention system that is a first on any Nissan in Europe. When activated, the steering wheel gently vibrates and the car's brakes are individually applied to guide the car back into its lane. Intelligent Emergency Braking. This avoids impacts or reduces the severity of them and includes pedestrian recognition technology. This latter element is a first for any Nissan B-hatchback in Europe. Traffic Sign Recognition. This technology means drivers always know the speed limit of the road they're driving on. The read-out is given on the combimeter. High Beam Assist. When activated, the headlamps automatically switch from dipped beam to high beam to improve night-time visibility and road safety. Intelligent Around View Monitor. Nissan's acclaimed 360Ë camera system aids reversing manoeuvres and includes Moving Object Detection for enhanced safety performance. Blind Spot Warning. Radar sensors installed in the rear bumper activate to warn the driver, visually and audibly, of other vehicles in adjacent lanes. This reduces the risk of an impact when pulling out. \nEvery new Micra comes with six airbags as standard, plus seat belt warnings and seat belt height adjustment for the front and rear. Isofix child seats can be used with the new Nissan Micra, including in the front passenger seat. Electronic safety systems include Electronic Stability Program, anti-lock brakes, and Hill Start Assist. A speed limiter, automatic headlight sensor, automatic hazard lights and a Tyre Pressure Monitoring System are also fitted to every Micra. \nThe new Micra is available with a Safety+ Pack, which is standard equipment on Tekna grade and optional on all others. It adds Intelligent Lane Intervention, Intelligent Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Recognition, Traffic Sign Recognition and High Beam Assist to the car's specification. \nThe safety technologies on the new Micra are proof of the brand's continuing commitment to Nissan Intelligent Mobility, its vision for a zero emissions and zero fatalities future. At its core are smart solutions that bring Nissan's brand promise - Innovation That Excites - to life, delivering a more confident, more connected and more exciting partnership between the driver and the car. \nAnnounced at Geneva Motor Show in March 2016, Nissan Intelligent Mobility is based around three pillars - Intelligent Power, which is a commitment to advanced powertrains and currently spearheaded by the EV powertrain in cars such as the Nissan Leaf; Intelligent Integration, which is about fostering greater co-operation between vehicles and society through better connectivity; and Intelligent Driving, which enhances driver confidence through advanced technologies. This latter element will be seen in the near future when autonomous driving capability - which Nissan calls ProPilot - is introduced on Nissan vehicles. \nConfident drive \nWhether it's darting through traffic in an urban environment or out on the open road, the new Nissan Micra is an exceptional car to drive. Engineered to be at home on the best and worst of European road surfaces, it provides an agile and exciting drive that's backed by the feeling of security that comes from predictable ride and handling. It's the perfect blend for today's B-hatchback customer. \nThe new Micra has been built on Nissan's existing V-platform, although it has been significantly enhanced to deliver new levels of performance. For example, the Nissan Micra provides outstanding stability and reduced body roll through corners thanks to its high body stiffness and advanced suspension. In addition, the low driving position promoted by the excellent ergonomics of the interior reduces the centre of gravity, further enhancing the secure driving feel. Responsive and accurate steering comes from a new brushless electric power unit, and provides a high degree of manoeuvrability. \nTwo advanced Nissan technologies further contribute to creating the new Micra's excellent dynamic performance. These include: Intelligent Ride Control. This technology improves the Micra's ride by using the engine and brakes to moderate the fore/aft pitching motion often felt when a car goes over larger bumps in the road, such as traffic calming measures. This moderation is supported by the shock absorbers, which dampen the vertical and pitch motions of the vehicle. Intelligent Trace Control. When cornering, this system automatically engages and adjusts the brakes on the inside of the vehicle, and the wheels on the outside, to keep the Micra on the optimal line. \nThe new Micra also benefits from a remarkably quiet cabin, promoting a comfortable and more relaxing experience for the driver. It's due to the enhanced noise isolation technology engineered into the car, and is particularly noticeable during high-speed driving, such as on a motorway. It's designed to allow the driver to hear the engine response, but stay isolated from other noises, such as that generated by the tyres on the road. \nDownsized engine range \nThe new Micra is available with three responsive and efficient downsized engines at launch - two petrol and one diesel. Each has been engineered and tuned to match the character of the vehicle, and provide the best possible mix of performance and fuel efficiency. \nDownsized engines linked to advanced fuel-saving technologies such as Idle Stop&Start (ISS) are the key to reduced running costs - a key driver of sales in the B-hatchback segment. Two of the three engines on the new Micra are available with ISS, which reduces fuel consumption when the vehicle is stationary. All launch engines are linked to a five-speed manual gearbox. \nOther engines and an automatic transmission are planned during the life cycle of the new Nissan Micra. \nFive grades to meet every customer's budgets \nThe new Micra is available in Nissan's familiar five-model grade structure of Visia, Visia+, Acenta, N-Connecta and Tekna. Not all grades are available with all engines. Every new Micra comes with a two-tone interior and there are three different versions - one for Visia and Visia+, a second for Acenta and N-Connecta, and a third for Tekna. Leather trim is an option on Tekna. \nThe exact specification for the new Micra varies by market. However, highlights of range include: Visia grade comes with 15-inch steel wheels/covers, LED daytime running lights, electric door mirrors with integrated turn signals, electric front windows, rear spoiler, Hill Start Assist, Intelligent Emergency Braking, trip computer with gear-shift indicator and outside temperature read-out, height-adjustable driver's seat, rake/reach adjustable steering wheel, two-tone dashboard Visia+ cars add air-conditioning, entry level audio system with two speakers Acenta grade adds 16-inch steels/covers, body-coloured door mirrors with turn indicator, body-coloured door handles, Display Audio seven-inch touch-screen infotainment system with four speakers, cruise control, two-tone upholstery N-Connecta cars come with 16-inch alloy wheels, front fog lamps, folding heated door mirrors, privacy glass, leather steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, NissanConnect seven-inch touch-screen infotainment system Tekna grade adds 17-inch alloy wheels, Nissan Intelligent Key with engine start button, rear view camera with rear parking sensors, BOSE Personal audio system with six speakers, Safety Pack, interior personalisation elements (please delete this) \nPersonalisation \nToday's B-hatchback customer has a strong desire to express their character through their car. This has led Nissan to create an extensive personalisation program for the new Micra, with features and colours designed to enhance the car's already expressive exterior and uplifting interior. \nExterior \nExterior personalisation adds additional components to the new Micra, each with a high-quality anodized finish. They are available in four colours from launch - Power Blue, Energy Orange, Enigma Black and Variant Chrome. More will follow during the car's life. Personalisation is available on Acenta grade and above, and colour choice can be expressed in three different ways: Exterior Pack - door mirror caps, front and rear bumper finishers, side mouldings. Exterior Pack Plus - adds 17-inch personalisation alloy wheels (choice of five styles). Exterior Pack Ultimate - all of the above, plus high-quality and durable body stickers (choice of seven styles). These can be applied to the Nissan Micra's side, bonnet and roof, and are included in the car's three-year warranty. \nExterior personalisation is not available in conjunction with Ivory, White and Pulse Green colours. \nInterior \nThe Interior Personalisation Pack features materials and colours which modify four distinct areas of the cabin - the seat bolsters and pad, door arm rest, knee pad and instrument panel. The pack is available on Acenta grade and above, and available in three colours - Power Blue, Energy Orange and Invigorating Red - to complement the Micra's exterior body colours. \nThe Interior Personalisation Pack is an optional extra on Acenta, N-Connecta and Tekna grades. There are two colour choices by grade; Power Blue and Energy Orange are linked to Acenta and N-Connecta, while Energy Orange and Invigorating Red are available on Tekna. Interior personalisation is not available in conjunction with Ivory, White and Pulse Green exterior colours. \nIn addition, a number of other packs are available as factory-fit options, including the Safety+ Pack (standard on Tekna grade). The other packs are named Cold, Style, Comfort and Tech, and group together themed content to enhance the specification of selected grades. \nA number of individual personalisation items are available to order through Nissan retailers. These include side mouldings, mirror caps, bumper finisher, lower boot finisher, rear view mirror cover, front seat central arm rest, upholstered floor mats and a boot mat. \nOther accessories include a shark-fin roof antenna, illuminated entry guards, ambient interior lighting, sports pedals, mudguards, tow ball and a range of carriers for leisure equipment such as bikes and skis. \nThe new Micra customer \nNissan has identified interior and exterior vehicle design as a strong sales driver across the B-segment, with customers attracted to dynamic and athletic styling. Today's supermini buyer wants to be viewed as contemporary and innovative; they want to be noticed. The new Nissan Micra, with its striking looks and wide range of personalisation options, clearly meets that need. \nSuch a strong focus on design means the new Micra is expected to appeal equally to male and female buyers, with a focus on younger individuals and couples without children, and 'empty nesters' with older families who have left home. \nAppealing to both private and corporate customers, the new Micra's high-quality design, generous interior space and high level of specification mean it will also tap into the trend for downsizing, as customers move from C-segment to B-segment hatchbacks. \nNissan Intelligent Get&Go \nThe new Nissan Micra has been developed with the customer at the heart of the car, but also at the centre of the retail and ownership experience. Nissan Intelligent Get&Go is proof of that. It is a just-launched pilot program, currently limited to the city of Paris but with a clear opportunity to spread if successful. \nIn short, it rewrites the rules. Nissan Intelligent Get&Go reinvents the traditional car ownership model in favour of a smarter shared leasing system. It allows multiple users - brought together through online profile matching and geo-localisation - to share the total cost of ownership on a long-term lease of a new Nissan Micra. \nThis is a perfect illustration of the Intelligent Integration element of Nissan Intelligent Mobility vision. It's a 100% digital experience for customers, and offers financial freedom to access and drive a new car without the full ownership commitment. \nManufacturing \nThe new Nissan Micra is manufactured at Flins, France, at a plant operated by Nissan's Alliance partner Renault. It is the first Nissan passenger car ever to be built at a Renault plant in Europe, and returns Micra production to Europe - close to its key customer base - after a break of seven years. \nFlins, to the west of Paris, is a factory with an outstanding pedigree in producing hatchbacks for the European market. It is currently also home to the Renault Clio and Renault Zoe models, and the new Nissan Micra is being built on the same production line. For Nissan, such co-operation means outstanding manufacturing quality and business synergies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T15:10:08.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
