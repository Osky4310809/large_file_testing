(Photo: Offside Sports Photography) Dele Alli is sent off (Photo: PA) \n\"[Alli] got what he deserved with the red card,\" the Sky Sports pundit wrote in his Sunday Times column. \n\"Yet that's also one of the reasons he could become a top player. Alli has a bit of devil in him, an edge that most top players possess. As strange as it sounds, if I was his manager, I'd be quietly saying to myself: \"Thank goodness he's got that in him.\" Graeme Souness (Photo: Sky Sports/Getty) \n\"Mauricio Pochettino, his manager, will not be happy that he was sent off, but he will be pleased that Alli cares when things are not going well. \n\"I've only seen Alli's challenge once but it was a throwback to my own playing days, one you see less and less now. The ball got away from him and he thought: 'Have some of that because the game's not going my way.'

That's why part of me gets why he did it.\" (Photo: Stephen Pond - The FA) \nThe victim of Alli's lunge revealed after the match that the Tottenham man had sought him out to offer an apology. \n\"Dele Alli just said sorry to me and that's nice from him, he's a professional,\" Dejaegere said. (Photo: PA) \n\"We're okay, it's football. I saw the images and it could have been much worse. I don't think he meant it because he came to apologise himself.\" \nAlli flew in with his studs raised and caught Dejaegere high on his leg, leaving the referee no option but to brandish a red card. \n\"I felt it was a really hard tackle but then in the moment, you turn the button and try to focus on the game,\" Dejaegere added.
