I don’t know how else to really explain the aura that surrounds people like him, who ditch their comfort zones and take the leap of faith only to succeed in ways they wouldn’t have imagined themselves. \nAskMen India caught up with Valladares in Bandra, Mumbai, to unveil his story about MetalHead Studio . 1. What was the genesis of MetalHead Studio and what did you do before? \nI worked for an airline for 8 years before I even thought about doing something with metal. Two years into flying and visiting different places, I developed an appreciation for art that I’d see all around the world and I always wanted to do something creative; but never really got down to it because I was stuck in what I saw as a dead-end job. \nThrough what can only be divine intervention, I ended up injuring myself and had to take a 3-month break. During that time my dad suggested that I do a course in metal I could use my time off in a productive way. Plus I'd gain a a creative skill. \nSo I signed up for Fr. Agnel’s; I just wanted to do something else. Even when I was flying, I would always carry a canvas and paint during my layovers and on time-off. So I began wondering if I could recreate my ideas into 3D forms. \nI bought my first welding machine and started tinkering with it on my terrace during my days off. A lot of my friends started appreciating the things I created and picked them up. This was 2012. \nA couple of months later, Nike through Homegrown , approached me and asked for a sketch for a larger-than-life installation at Kalaghoda Arts Festival . Because the World Cup was set to happen in 2013, they wanted something to do with cricket, which I love. \nI jumped at that opportunity, said yes, and sent them a design. I got selected from the shortlisted candidates. But then they told me that I had 9 days to complete it. I was like “Whaaat?” They were taking a risk because I wasn’t known and I didn’t consider myself an artist at that point. So, at that moment, I quit my job. Over the phone. That was it. I jumped in. \nI didn’t sleep for those 9 days. The installation weighed more than 4 tonnes and in 3 different parts, but I managed with the help of all the suppliers who I sourced all the sprockets from . 2. How do you conceptualise pieces? \nAfter pulling off that first installation, I thought to myself, if I can do this, I can do anything. So, I just started working on all the designs that kept coming into my head--sometimes, looking at something and trying to figure out what else I can turn it into. \nOne time, I was riding on Carter Road and I saw this old, scrap bike. I found out from the owner if I could buy it off him, and he was confused because to him it was worthless. I turned the chassey into a Praying Mantis because I saw it as soon as I saw the bike. That was the second time I felt validated, like I had caught onto something that I could really excel at. 3. How long do you usually take to finish a piece? \nThe time I take is wholly dependent on each project. Also, I’ve gotten quicker with time. Something that would take me 2 days when I first started, I can now do in 45 minutes. I made a 14 ft. metal shark that I left on Carter road, but that took me a month to get the shape right and all that. 4. Tell us about a standout installation. \nI have a 12 foot rickshaw parked in my building that I pay parking charges for (laughs) It was a smashed up rickshaw that I found in Bhivandi and I transformed it. It was used for Celebrate Bandra . 5. What are the milestone moments in your career so far? \nAnything that provides a challenge is pivotal at that point. Recently, I got a project from the BMC to do up the Mount Mary Steps. They wanted a painting, but I suggested mosaic (even though I had never done it before and my brain was screaming at me, ‘What are you saying, you’ve never worked with mosaic?”) They agreed and gave me 6 hours to come up with an idea. \nI thought of doing opposites for the two sides of the stairs – the sun and moon, kind of inspired by Van Gogh, one of my biggest inspirations. BMC approved the design and gave me a week to get it done right before the Bandra Fair. I finished a couple of hours before the Mount Mary procession started. \nThis was after the biggest hiccup – a downpour – two days before four-and-half-lakh people were going to use the steps. I prayed for a miracle, and God really answered my prayers. Looking at people appreciate it as they walked up and down, that was a big milestone, especially because I made a mark in my neighbourhood – Bandra. 6. What do you do to unwind? \nI try to keep my Sundays free unless there’s a deadline. I play cricket, I love cricket. 7. What’s next? \nI don’t want to stick to just metal. I want to experiment with different mediums and how they interact with each other. I wanted to melt glass with metal, so I tried it. Basically, I keep learning on the job and trying new things. I am just going to keep experimenting. For me, a scrapyard is Candy Land because I can visualise so many things. And I’m hoping to collaborate with more people now, no matter what medium they work with. 8. Any advice for people who want your job or who wants to chase a dream? \nTake the step, you never know what's going to come out of it. If you don't believe in it, don't do it, but if you do, then definitely just go for it. When you create something that you've imagined and dreamed of, and it actually comes to life, that's everything you need to just keep going. \nYou don't need anybody else's approval as long as you're happy with what you've done. You should be your own biggest critic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T06:41:15.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
