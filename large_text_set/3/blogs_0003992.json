Many may not even realize that the pair were close, but they (both children of legends and intensely creative people in their own right) were great friends. In one of his tributes to Fisher , Sean admitted that his heart was “completely and permanently broken,” after losing “one of the best and closest friends I’ve ever had in my life.”\nTheir song is called “Bird Song” and Sean casually posted it on Soundcloud . We love how quietly beautiful and intimate this song is, and their affection for each other is definitely evident in the tone. Sean accompanied the song with a message about the track, noting the familiar singer who helped him record it.\n“Carrie and I wrote this song years ago. When she died I just felt I had to record it. This is only a demo unmixed, we only had a few hours to record it. But the lyrics she wrote with me I think are marvelous. Carrie and I used to stay up til dawn chatting and pontificating about life. They were my best moments. Anyway…we wrote a song about staying up too late and hearing the birds sing. Willow Smith is a prodigal angel and was generous enough to lend her golden voice to this little tune.” A post shared by Sean Ono Lennon (@sean_ono_lennon) on Jan 4, 2017 at 12:12pm PST \nMaybe one day Sean will decide to release a studio version, but for now, we’re happy that he’s sharing such a personal track with other people who adored his friend Carrie.\nIn the description on Sean’s Soundcloud page , he says he has, “so many unreleased jamz and song ideas” and a collection of them are there for our listening pleasure. After we get through “Bird Song” a few more times.\nStill got it. @saul_adamczewski @benromans_hopcraft @nathansaoudi \nA post shared by Sean Ono Lennon (@sean_ono_lennon) on Dec 19, 2016 at 4:48pm PST \nThank you, Sean, for sharing such a special piece of your friendship with Carrie. We’re sending so much love.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:59:57.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
