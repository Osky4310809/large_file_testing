And then the denim hair trend totally took over in 2016, which made our hearts sing! We were so pumped when we figured out how to dye our hair blue with ease ! Now, 2017 is bringing major winter vibes thanks to the silver blue hair trend. It’s a killer combination of both, and it couldn’t be more stunning!\nHonestly, this silver blue hair look is an absolute dream come true.
