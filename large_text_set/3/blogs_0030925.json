A murdered-out Chevrolet SS? One of the last Dodge Vipers? Congratulations. Your car isn’t anywhere close to being as menacing as this 1989 Tatra 613—especially since it was allegedly owned by the KGB. \nAdvertisement \n\nWe found this weird gem on eBay today, and I have to tell you it’s one of the most intimidating vehicles I’ve ever seen. For whatever reason, it’s for sale out of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, but its homeland was the Soviet Union, where it apparently served Mother Russia’s KGB proudly during at least part of the Cold War.\n\nThe Tatra 613 was a rear-engined sedan built in what was then Czechoslovakia from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s. In that rear trunk you’ll find a 3.5-liter air-cooled V8, which must be a most wonderful-sounding motor indeed. The 613 was popular among government officials and in law enforcement, including the KGB.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nFrankly, I love the way it looks, especially here in shining black with those steel wheels. The whole thing screams dictatorship and secret police —it’s imposing, brutal and utilitarian. If this thing rolled past you on the street, you’d keep your mouth shut about your great leader and what you thought of his last “election.”\n\nThis 1989 example on eBay has just 25,000 miles on the clock and, as of this writing, has bids under $7,000. How the hell you’d go about repairing and maintaining this thing is beyond me, but it’s a great find for any collector willing to own an unusual piece of Eastern European automotive history.\n\nHere’s what the seller has to say:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:27:31.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
