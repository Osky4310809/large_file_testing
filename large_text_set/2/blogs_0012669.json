Photo by Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net \nNicole Tiamzon has finally exorcised a demon. \nIn all her years wearing maroon, she has never had the chance to defeat the monster clad in green, until now. \nUniversity of the Philippines did the improbable and took a three-set victory over defending champion De La Salle, 25-22, 25-21, 25-19.

We’re so happy because this is the first time we’ve beaten La Salle after so many years,” said Tiamzon after the win Wednesday at Filoil Flying V Arena. \nTiamzon had 16 points in leading the Lady Maroons to a 3-0 start, tied for the best record with National University in Season 79, and snapping her school’s 16-game losing streak against La Salle. \nUP’s last win against La Salle happened in 2008 when the Lady Spikers’ second round victories in Season 70 was forfeited due to Jacqueline Alarca’s ineligibility. \n“This win serves as an eye-opener for our next games and it tells us we should push ourselves even harder,” said Tiamzon. “And of course it was a huge boost to the team’s morale that we were able to beat La Salle.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:41:26.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
