During Anderson's freestyle run, he drove toward one of the ramps, attempting to do a full backflip. Unfortunately, the truck only flipped half-way. This left the behemoth machine to land square on the roll cage, as can be seen in the video above .\n\nAccording to Motorsport.com , Anderson was taken to a local hospital after the crash. No details were given about the nature of his injury, but a ccording to Anderson's son , he is on the mend. In two Instagram posts, his son said Anderson is getting better, and the first post indicated he was more concerned about what happens next with the team than with the injury.\n\nWant thank everyone for the kind words for dad. Yes he was injured and all that needs to be known is he's getting better. He just called me to tell me what to do with to fix the problem. Anyone that knows dad knows he's more worried about making the fans happy than himself. It's part of our lifestyle yes it's scary but that's what makes life exciting. Dad's always telling me what to do #dadlife \nA photo posted by Adam Anderson (@adamanderson_gd) on Jan 15, 2017 at 6:37pm PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:06:18.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
