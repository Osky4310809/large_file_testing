They just make them up when there are none.” \nHe also said reporters “shouldn’t be allowed” to use unnamed sources. \nAttacks on the press defined Trump’s campaign and have been a theme of his first month in office. On Friday, it took the president roughly a minute to call out the “dishonest media,” after telling the attendees in the crowded ballroom to sit down. \n“The dishonest media, they’ll say, ‘He didn’t get a standing ovation,'” Trump said. “You know why? Because everybody stood and nobody sat.” \nThe-CNN-Wire & 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
