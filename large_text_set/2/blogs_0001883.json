Nearly 80 percent of the United States' avocados come from Mexico.\nThe connection may still loom large approaching the brand's most important advertising effort of the year.\nAs Trump's controversies swallow up the news cycle day in and day out, even the most innocuous references can trigger angry reactions.\nIn a way, Avocados From Mexico is a victim of its own success\nBudweiser, for instance, has already been accused of political grandstanding on social media for a Super Bowl ad that simply depicts its founder's journey as an immigrant. Never mind that its premise was finalized months before Trump's inauguration.\nWhile Super Bowl advertisers usually obsess over finding the cultural pulse of the moment, most big brands start plotting their messages as early as the day after the previous Big Game. It's doubtful that many of them could've foreseen the exact nature of our current political climate.\nIn a way, Avocados From Mexico is a victim of its own success. The fatty fruit (yes, it technically is) was only a big discussion topic in the first place because of the special place it's found in America's heart in recent years ‚Äî just look at the fuss over guac at Chipotle or avocado toast.
