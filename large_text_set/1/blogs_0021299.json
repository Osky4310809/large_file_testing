Now Jay Bruce’s Mets voyage is prepared to dock at a destination both more traditional and less expected.\nThe Mets have notified Bruce they anticipate starting the season with him as their everyday right fielder, an industry source told The Post. General manager Sandy Alderson said two weeks ago that Bruce, after being dangled in trade discussions for much of the offseason, could very well join the team at Tradition Field for spring training, and the team is now acting as if it will have Bruce for the entirety of the season.\nThe Mets would of course slam the brakes on this plan if a late suitor presented an interesting package, but that appears a long shot. And given all of their health questions, the idea of having the durable Bruce, who has played in 137 or more games every season since 2010, holds additional appeal.\nA glacially moving market for hitters foiled the Mets’ original plan to trade Bruce and his $13 million salary in return for a prospect and then use the payroll flexibility to acquire a reliever. None of those dominoes fell into place, meaning the Mets might very well try to go forward with their current bullpen core despite the absence of a veteran left-hander to go after dangerous National League East lefty bats like the Nationals’ Bryce Harper and Daniel Murphy and the Braves’ Freddie Freeman.\nSEE ALSO \nAlderson: What's blocking the Mets from trading Jay Bruce :0 Jay Bruce’s new team could be his old one, at... Alderson: What's blocking the Mets from trading Jay Bruce The retention of Bruce, who turns 30 on April 3 (the Mets’ Opening Day), also has potential consequences for Michael Conforto, the Mets’ top 2014 draft pick who regressed in 2016 after a blazing 2015 debut. Depending on how spring training unfolds, Conforto could be part of the Mets’ outfield mix, or he still has minor-league options available and could get more at-bats at Triple-A Las Vegas.\nAnother piece of the puzzle to consider: With first baseman Lucas Duda returning from a serious back injury, the Mets figure to try both Bruce and Conforto at first base in Grapefruit League action so they can further assess their options. Bruce played three games at first base for the Reds in 2014. David Wright, with his own back and neck problems, also could wind up in the first-base mix, with Wilmer Flores and Jose Reyes set as insurance pieces for Wright’s spot at third base.\nBruce has been an imperfect fit since joining the Mets last Aug. 1 in a trade that sent second-base prospect Dilson Herrera and minor league pitcher Max Wotell to Cincinnati. The Mets made the trade because they desperately needed offense … and Bruce didn’t help much on that front, putting up a lousy .219/.294/.391 slash line in 50 games and getting benched and booed, as Curtis Granderson slid over from right field to center field to make room for Bruce. Optimists can point out that in his final eight games of the season, when the Mets needed to win to get the NL wild-card spot, Bruce went .480/.536/1.000 with four homers. Bruce owns a career .248/.318/.467 slash line with 241 home runs.\nBruce AP The Mets exercised Bruce’s team option shortly after the completion of the World Series because they wanted to protect themselves in case Cespedes, who opted out of his deal right around the same time, signed with another club. Cespedes’ return for a four-year, $110 million deal gave the Mets an outfield surplus — injury-prone Juan Lagares is set to be Granderson’s platoon partner in center field — that they now appear prepared to carry forward.\nIf Bruce indeed stays put, the Mets must decide whether to increase their payroll, which is projected to be in the ballpark of $150 million, to upgrade their bullpen. With young options like Zack Wheeler (who has missed the last two years due to 2015 Tommy John surgery) and either Seth Lugo or Robert Gsellman available, the Mets think they have some coverage when Jeurys Familia gets suspended for violating baseball’s domestic violence program. However, their group of lefties is topped by the inexperienced Josh Edgin and Josh Smoker. Jerry Blevins, who limited lefties to a .255/.313/.324 slash line in 68 games last year for the Mets, remains available as a free agent and is clearly interested in rejoining the club.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:47:07.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
