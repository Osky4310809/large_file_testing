It's no longer just a race between Valve and Oculus, SteamVR now has choices within it—which means competition without exacerbating the exclusivity war between platforms. More options is nearly always a good thing, and I'm excited to see how this pushes LG, HTC, and any other hardware company Valve might be talking with to innovate. And hopefully it will drive the cost of VR down even further, after the . \nSamuel Roberts: Feeling groovy \nAs if Chucklefish hadn't already cornered the idea of rad new games that look a bit like rad old games, here comes Wargroove , which takes its cues from Nintendo's abandoned-for-some-reason Advance Wars, a turn-based strategy series that I definitely didn't emulate for the entire summer of 2004. With modding support and online play, this already looks like a hit in the making—while we're not short on this sort of game on PC, this kind of Nintendo-infused art direction is much rarer and harder to do well. \nJoe Donnelly: System stunner \nWhen Nightdive's System Shock remake was delayed last year I was a wee bit sad. I mean, I totally understand that games get delayed with the best of intentions, but the fact is: I'm really quite looking forward to returning to the Citadel Station—so much so that 2018 just seems so far away from now. As you can imagine, I was pleased to see new in-game pre-alpha footage emerge this week which flaunted the familiar space-flung locale with its hordes of vicious alien foes all tarted up on PC. Furthermore, since we were of Nightdive's reimagining of the 1994 classic, it's made the jump from Unity to Unreal Engine 4. \nYes, 2018 is a ways away yet, but you should totally to check out how System Shock is coming along. \nTim Clark: Dawning on me \nI’m not a strategic guy, as even a quick glance at my CV tells prospective employers. And the last RTS I spent any real time with was Starcraft II, circa Wings of Liberty. But this week I got to take a look at Dawn of War III, which for now I am under orders not to discuss the details of. However, as someone who created and painted his own Space Marine chapter back in the day, lore and all, I think I’m safe to say that 40K superfans are going to be pretty happy. Samuel is off to the studio next week, so expect to hear much more from us shortly. \nChris Livingston: Full sail \nIn a sea of new games at GDC, it can sometimes be the glimpse of something familiar that draws the eye.
