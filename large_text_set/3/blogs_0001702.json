The first offer was an endorsement deal with the brand in 2013, followed by $100,000 USD to the single fastest time in 2014, $100,000 USD to the top three fastest times in 2015 and $1 million USD dollars to the athlete who could shatter the speed precedent in 2016.\nBut now, they’ve upped the ante; a private island valued at $1 million USD.\nThat beats the carrot cake @adidasFballUS gave me for breaking the @NFL single season rushing yards record lol #NFLCombine #ED2105 https://t.co/VmPaxkrpbi \n— Eric Dickerson (@EricDickerson) February 28, 2017 \n\nEric Dickerson, who owns the NFL record for single-season rushing yards, pointed out that the prize was much better than what he got for in-game accolades.\nThe last man to come close to beating Johnson’s record was Dri Archer – a running back from Kent State – who zipped to a 4.26 finish in 2014.\nRunning backs and wide receivers – both positions with prime candidates to achieve the feat – are scheduled to begin running the 40-yard dash on Friday. Although, the average time for those respective positions is 4.59 and 4.55, respectively.\nFor more cleat news, check out a roundup of the wildest footwear worn in the NFL this year . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:33:58.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
