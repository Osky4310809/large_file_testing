This is called the WCOL (World Cost of Living) Index.\nThe cost of living in Asia's rapidly expanding cities like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Seoul has surged in recent years, and Asian cities occupy five of the six top spots — although European and American cities dominate the rest of the ranking.\nTake a look at the 15 world cities where the cost of living is highest.\nView As: One Page Slides 15. Melbourne, Australia — The second most-populous city in Australia has jumped six places from last year. \"This movement is in sync with a number of other Asian cities, which have come to dominate at the top of the ranking,” the survey's editor Jon Copestake said in a statement. Lenny K Photography/Flickr 14. Sydney, Austrlia — Like Melbourne, Sydney has climbed six places since last year and lies in 14th place. The rankings for both cities are still lower than five years ago, when both were among the 10 most expensive in the world. Taras Vyshnya/Shutterstock T=11. Tel Aviv, Israel — Located on the country's Mediterranean coastline, Tel Aviv is the financial and technological hub of Israel. It has risen to joint 11th place, from 14th last year, with a WCOL score of 99. Dance60 / Shutterstock T=11. Oslo, Norway — Like many Scandinavian capitals, Oslo has a reputation for being very expensive. Along with Tel Aviv, it rose from 14th place on last year's index. Jørn Eriksson, Flickr T=11. Los Angeles, USA — Also scoring 99 on the index, Los Angeles is only slightly cheaper than New York when it comes to the overall cost of living, and is down from eighth place last year. Flickr/ahhdrjones T=9. Copenhagen, Denmark — The Danish capital has fallen from eighth last year to ninth this year, scoring 100 on the index and tying with New York itself. The report says that Copenhagen \"features in the ten priciest, largely owing to relatively high transport and personal care costs.\" mapics/Shutterstock T=9. New York City, USA — New York City is the sole North American representative in the top 10. The Big Apple has fallen from seventh last year to ninth this year due to a slight weakening of the dollar. TTstudio/Shutterstock T=7. Paris, France — The French capital has featured among the ten most expensive cities for 15 years, although the report says that \"the relative cost of living in the French capital has moderated. Currently, living in Paris is 7% more expensive than living in New York, but just five years ago it was 50% pricier.\" People protect themselves from the rain under umbrellas at Trocadero Square near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, January 12, 2017.

While expensive, it remains more affordable than Zurich — the other Swiss city on the list — and has fallen from 4th place on last year's ranking. Shutterstock 6. Seoul, South Korea — The South Korean capital is one of the three most expensive places in the world to buy staple goods, including food essentials, according to the report. In Seoul, topping up a grocery basket is almost 50% more expensive than in New York. Its WCOL score increased to 108 from 99 last year, taking it four places up the rankings. travel oriented/Flickr 5. Osaka, Japan — This year's index sees a return to the top ten for Osaka, one of Japan's most populous cities, and a major economic hub. The cost of living is 9% higher than in New York, up from 3% less last year. Laitr Keiows, Wikipedia 4. Tokyo, Japan — The Japanese capital shot up the rankings from 11th last year. The report says that Tokyo, which was the world’s most expensive city until 2012, \"has moved seven places up the ranking owing to a sustained recovery in the strength of the Japanese yen.\" ESB Professional / Shutterstock 3. Zurich, Switzerland — With a WCOL score of 113, Zurich is the only barrier to Asia holding all five of the top spots, making it the most expensive European city. The report notes, however, that the relative cost of living has fallen slightly this year there. AleksandarGeorgiev / Getty Images 2. Hong Kong — The east Asian territory remains second on the ranking with a WCOL score of 114, the same as last year. House prices and local living costs there remain exceptionally high. Ronnie Chua/Shutterstock 1. Singapore — The island city-state in southeast Asia sits at the top of the ranking for the fourth consecutive year, with a WCOL score of 120. While it is the most expensive place in the world to buy and run a car, the report says that it offers \"relative value\" compared to its Asian peers in key categories such as domestic goods and personal care. tatsmis / Shutterstock More from Business Insider UK: 15 expensive steakhouses that are actually worth the price Trump says he wants to tackle drug pricing in the GOP's Obamacare replacement plan (IBB) Trump's Supreme Court pick is pressed on whether he could rule against the president: 'That's a softball, Mr. Chairman' Dave Chappelle says 'Key & Peele' 'hurts my feelings' Here's everything Apple just announced this morning (AAPL) More: Features Cost Of Living World Cost Of Living Index EIU Economist Intelligence Unit", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:38:49.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
