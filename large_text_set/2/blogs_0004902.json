But there was one thing about the Super Bowl that was almost as unbelievable as the 25-point deficit that the Patriots erased to earn the victory: the price of food and booze for those in attendance at NRG Stadium in Houston. \nThe Super Bowl is undeniably a super-sized event loaded with bells and whistles and an over-the-top halftime performance, but fans who wanted to watch the game in person (most tickets are reserved for sponsors ) paid dearly for the opportunity. Sure, the average price of a ticket was $4,744 to Super Bowl LI on the secondary market, according to CBS Sports , but maybe more egregious was that Cheetos Popcorn cost $11 and a lemonade with a shot of booze in it was $15—or $30 for a double.

A 32-ounce soda in a commemorative plastic cup cost $11, and a bottle of water, $6. A burger, fries, and beer added up to $33. (For comparison, during the regular season a hot dog costs $5.75 at a Houston Texans game.) \n— Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) February 5, 2017 \nThose are pretty nosebleed prices, but things were actually worse last year in the spendy San Francisco Bay Area , where the Denver Broncos met and defeated the Carolina Panthers. At that game, a glass of wine went for a gut wrenching $25, a domestic beer $13, and a bottle of water $7. They also had a crab sandwich on the menu that cost $20, but at least there’s a hint of ambition there that might justify a higher price point. \nGiven how the game went, it’s likely that fans were in a need of a lot of booze—especially the Falcons fans who were likely shocked at the last-minute shake-up. Unfortunately for them, most stadiums stop selling booze before the final quarter, just when they were probably beginning to look in earnest for a drink, price be damned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:29:40.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
