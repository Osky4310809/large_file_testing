A glum mood — or even a glum season — is easy to fall into and difficult to revive yourself from. If it is in your nature to wallow in your sorrows or to obsess over finding one big solution for everything that's got you down in the dumps, try starting with the little things instead. You'll be surprised at what a difference they can make! We like to believe that minor acts such as these are like seeds — though they're little, they can help you to grow out of your blues, remedy your gloom, and get you back on track toward a happy life . \nSee for yourself! Get to the source. Write out your thoughts, if only for yourself to read. Call your best friend and vent. Cook yourself a hearty meal. Buy flowers for your desk. Go for a dusky evening or early morning walk. Listen to sad music. ( Here's why .) Reread a book that calmed you once before. Take a nap (and don't feel guilty about it). Splurge on something you've been eyeing. Sing karaoke. Really — it works. Let yourself be goofy! Make yourself go out and do something, even if it's as simple as running an errand. Take up an instrument. Move around the furniture in your room. A change of scenery can be a godsend. Get coffee with a very old friend. Do yoga (even if you've never tried it before). Visit a place connected with fond memories. Spend a day actively being nice to everyone you encounter. Try your hand at a DIY project . Spend a night being as spontaneous as you can with an adventurous friend. Say yes to social events, even if you don't feel like it. (You can always end up leaving, but you might find that you don't want to.) Listen to holiday music, no matter the time of year. Write a letter to someone who has been weighing on your mind. Take a break from social media and see how it makes you feel. See how long you can go without complaining about a single thing. Start planning out your days; structure can create a sense of purpose. Give yourself time to hide away, veg out, and then pick yourself back up. Sometimes to beat the blues you have to allow yourself to embrace them — but only for a time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:50:31.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
