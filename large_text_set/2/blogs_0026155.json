That increase alone is roughly the size of the entire annual military budget of the United Kingdom, the fifth-largest spending country, and it’s more than 80 percent of Russia’s entire military budget in 2015.\nIf Congress were to follow Trump’s blueprint, the U.S. military budget could account for nearly 40 percent of global military spending next year. The U.S. would be outspending Russia by a margin of greater than 9 to 1.\nAt a meeting of U.S. governors on Monday, Trump described his forthcoming budget proposal as “a public safety and national security budget.”\nThe share of world military expenditure of the 15 states with the highest expenditure in 2015.\nGraphic: SIRPI\n\nU.S. military spending has been at permanent wartime levels since the 2001 terror attacks, despite the significant drawdowns in Afghanistan and Iraq under President Obama. Spending has declined since the wars were at their peak in 2010, but U.S. military spending in 2015 remains at 190 percent of what it was before 9/11, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, a leading tracker of weapons and defense spending.\nThroughout his campaign, Trump criticized bloated weapons contracts and the overall cost of wars in the Middle East. But he also promised to make the military “strong again,” pledging to build 70 new warships and to increase the total troops in the army to their levels at the number of troops to Afghanistan and Iraq war levels were at their peak.\nTrump has also called for the U.S. to “greatly expand” its nuclear weapons capabilities, signaling a potential willingness to expand a $1 trillion modernization effort Obama started that was already widely criticized by budget critics as unaffordable.\nThe White House did not elaborate on how the Pentagon would spend the extra money. CNN reported that the White House was planning dramatic cuts to the EPA and foreign aid budgets. Both are tiny components of the federal budget and are unlikely to add up to anywhere near $54 billion.\nTop Photo: Members of the U.S. Army Drill Team perform in New York’s Times Square in honor of the Army’s 240th birthday on June 12, 2015.\nThe post Trump’s Proposed Increase in U.S. Defense Spending Would Be 80 Percent of Russia’s Entire Military Budget appeared first on The Intercept .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:19:06.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
