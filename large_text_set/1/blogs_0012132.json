Emre Can has gone off the boil and if Liverpool were to pick a first-choice XI, he would probably be just outside that. The pair agree that Pogba and Ibrahimovic will have LIverpool worried this Sunday (Photo: Reuters) Mourinho must be ready for Liverpool to \"disturb\" Michael Carrick's composure, says Neville (Photo: John Peters) \n\"He has still played a lot because the manager likes him and Jordan Henderson has been out, but he has been a little bit off. He can’t afford to let that happen if he plays.\" \nNeville has his own theory as to how the Liverpool boss will set his side up and the tactics the German will employ against Jose Mourinho 's team. \nHe added: \"I imagine Klopp will want to disturb Michael Carrick’s composure. The key area will probably be Liverpool’s midfield trio against Pogba, Ander Herrera and Carrick.

He has been scoring goals and Liverpool continue to concede them, so that is another vital area.\" Klopp and Mourinho must get their tactics spot on on Sunday (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty) The pair clash in the Old Trafford fixture in March 2010 (Photo: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty) Read More Man Utd v Liverpool: Just TWO Anfield stars make Robbie Savage's all-time combined derby XI - do you agree? \nAnd Nevile agreed, adding: \"The personality and character of Ibrahimovic is having a massive impact upon the players in the United dressing room. \n\"You talk about managers having an influence in the dressing room, but when they’re out on the pitch, Ibrahimovic’s influence is huge. It feels like Liverpool will have to handle his personality and character on Sunday.\" \nThe pair also agreed on another point - that Manchester United are favourites going into the game. poll loading Who are you backing for Sunday's game at Old Trafford? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T12:53:52.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
