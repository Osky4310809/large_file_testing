Very 'disappointing' change of position says former mayor \nFormer Bombala Shire mayor Bob Stewart said his council, among others, had put forward good arguments opposing amalgamations and said, \"John Barilaro gave no support for that at all\". \nMr Stewart said he was disappointed that Mr Barilaro had changed his position after the merger of Bombala with Cooma-Monaro and Snowy River Shires had been proclaimed. \n\"It seems very about-turn, and very disappointing, and very sad for those communities,\" he said. \n\"To back-pedal on what he believed was the right way to go just to gain political success doesn't fit well with me.\" \nEarly last year Mr Barilaro was accused of hypocrisy by the Shadow Minister for Local Government, Peter Primrose, for voting down a Labor motion to oppose forced local government amalgamations. \nMr Primrose pointed to public statements by Mr Barilaro that there would be no forced amalgamations in his region and questioned why he failed to push that position in the parliament. Amalgamations forced upon communities \nFollowing the announcement of the mergers last May, Mr Barilaro said: \"This is a tough decision, but we're doing it because we genuinely believe in delivering better services, better infrastructure for our communities\". \nPenny Judge, from the Delegate Progress Association, said Mr Barilaro had \"put himself in a very bad place\" with his announcement of opposition to further mergers. \n\"What he's literally admitting is that the amalgamations are not a good thing, not necessarily a good thing,\" Ms Judge said. \nShe said the amalgamations should never have happened, and were forced upon communities. \n\"He was instrumental in it happening, and now he's stepping back from it and trying to say 'it's nothing to do with me, I'm going to fix up these regional councils', but he's not going to fix up the ones in his own electorate,\" she said. \n\"His whole electorate are merged councils, and they are not happy merged councils. \n\"He only needs to lose 1,122 votes at the next election to be bundled out of office.\" Not too late to reverse mergers \nMr Barilaro rejected suggestions of reversing any mergers. \n\"Reversing mergers is actually a bad outcome for communities,\" he said. \n\"This is about the communities going first, being the priority, and we're seeing some significant investment in those communities because of mergers, and the last thing they want is disruption.\" \nHowever, Ms Judge said it was not too late to reverse the mergers of the councils in Mr Barilaro's electorate. \n\"We have not had new council elections yet, we are still in a state of flux, we are still in administration,\" she said. \n\"Yes, it would take a very game and a very brave Premier to say we are going to re-think this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T08:34:09.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
