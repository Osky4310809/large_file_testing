If it makes you feel any better, even fit-girl Bipasha Basu has her dog days too, and they aren’t any different from ours. The actress recently posted a video, where she can be seen trying her best to sit straight on a training machine but despite her best efforts, collapses (it's dramatic, not real, so don't worry about her!) at every second. Behind the camera, her husband, Karan Singh Grover, can be heard talking to her, possibly helping her to stay awake. Though, in front of the camera, Bipasha continues to answer his questions in an indecipherable voice, which is all kinds of hilarious.
