Chef Jason Bond is shutting down one of his two Bondir locations, keeping the original Cambridge restaurant open, Boston Restaurant Talk reported . Bondir Concord first opened in 2013 , three years after Bond opened the first location. Much larger than its Cambridge counterpart, the Concord restaurant kept to the tradition of changing up the menu daily based on local and seasonal offerings. Its replacement will be Fiorella’s, which has a sit-down restaurant in Newton and three express locations in Brighton, Cambridge, and Belmont. Fiorella’s will bring a hefty dose of Italian dishes to the 24 Walden St. space. The Newton location serves a lineup of dishes cooked in its wood-fired brick oven, including Neapolitan-style pizzas, and the menu also features pasta, antipasti, salads, soups, and more. The express locations also serve sandwiches and wraps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:05:11.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
