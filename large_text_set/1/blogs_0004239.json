London Underground warned that it was unlikely to be able to open many stations in the central Zone 1 area during its strike, while Southern is unlikely to run any trains on its strike days. \nHowever, BA vowed on Friday to ensure all passengers booked to travel on its strike days were able to complete their journeys. BA said it would operate all scheduled services to or from London’s Gatwick and City airports on Tuesday and Wednesday, when “mixed fleet” cabin crew belonging to Unite are due to walk out . \nBA, part of International Airlines Group , would also operate the “vast majority” of flights to and from London Heathrow normally but would merge “a very small number” of services, offering affected passengers earlier or later flights than planned. \nThe only movement in negotiations on Friday was at London Underground, in which station staff are due to walk out in protest over the effect of cuts in their numbers. Related article Dispute centres on closure of train doors and changing role of guards Saturday, 7 January, 2017 \nBoth sides attended talks over a potential settlement in the dispute, in which LU accepts that it needs to take on more staff at some stations, but they broke down in early afternoon. \nMick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, one of two unions representing station staff, said LU had failed to produce any “serious plans” for tackling what he called a “staffing and safety crisis”. \n“It is up to London Underground to take full responsibility for this situation and to come back to us with a serious set of proposals,” Mr Cash said. \nSteve Griffiths, London Underground’s chief operating officer, said there was no need to strike, arguing that the operator was already intending to review staffing levels. \n“We agree that we need more staff in our stations and have already started to recruit 150 extra staff,” Mr Griffiths said. \nLU expects to have to close most of the busiest central London stations during the strike and to offer no service at all on the Victoria or Waterloo & City Lines. \nThere was no progress on Friday over resolving the twin disputes between Govia Thameslink Rail, Southern’s parent, and the separate unions that represent drivers and conductors on the busy service. \nAslef, which represents the drivers, on Thursday dismissed a report from the Office of Rail and Road that found no basis for most of their concerns about the safety of the changes, under which drivers will shut doors using closed-circuit television to make sure no passengers are trapped or obstructing closure. \nThe RMT, which represents conductors on Southern, late on Thursday accepted an invitation to talks with Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, but it is unclear if any talks will be held. \nThe Aslef drivers’ strike is expected to halt all trains on Southern, which normally carries 300,000 passengers daily, and reduce frequencies on Gatwick Express, the London to Gatwick airport shuttle. Aslef on Wednesday called off further strikes planned for Monday, Thursday and Saturday of next week but called a further three days of strikes for the end of this month. \nBoth Charles Horton, Govia Thameslink’s chief executive, and Mr Grayling have called on both unions to call off the strikes in light of the ORR’s ruling on the safety issues. \nOn BA, the mixed-fleet cabin crew, a group of junior staff who can work on both short-haul and long-haul flights, are striking over what they call “poverty pay”. The dispute appeared to have been resolved before Christmas after Unite, their union, won concessions from management in settlement talks at the conciliation service Acas. But the new strike was called this week after union members rejected that deal. \nThe mixed-fleet crews account for only about 15 per cent of BA’s flight attendants, however, and the airline said it expected to carry 200,000 passengers across the two strike days despite the action. \n“We urge Unite to abandon its strike plans, which are serving only to cause anxiety among our mixed-fleet cabin crew colleagues, who do a tremendous job for our customers,” the airline said. BA remained open to talks with Unite, it added. \nUnite said that BA’s offer before Christmas had not gone far enough in addressing mixed fleet crews’ concerns. The union claims that mixed-fleet cabin crew on average earn just £16,000 a year, but BA says the group’s earnings last year ranged from approximately £21,000 to £27,000. \nUnions have insisted that the rash of strikes has not been co-ordinated.
