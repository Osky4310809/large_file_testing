Trying to get a call-up done late in the afternoon on New Year’s Eve is next to impossible, so they turned to their 37-year-old equipment manager. \nJorge Alves signs his professional tryout contract to serve as the #Canes back-up goaltender tonight. #CARvsTBL pic.twitter.com/i3DOaTLlr2 \n— Carolina Hurricanes (@NHLCanes) December 31, 2016 Second page of the PTO for Jorge Alves, with his player information. Jorge played club hockey for @NCStateHockey . #statement @NCState pic.twitter.com/WJ0MNTsFLH \n— Mike Sundheim (@MikeSundheim) December 31, 2016 First of all, how nice that you can sign contracts on iPhones now! Super convenient. And Alves is pretty experienced at the position: he played for N.C. State in 2002-03 and played in the ECHL for a few years before becoming the Hurricanes’ equipment manager. He probably thought his NHL dreams were over. \nJorge Alves leads the #Canes onto the ice. #CARvsTBL pic.twitter.com/pNWyWc2mL1 \n— Michael Smith (@MSmithCanes) December 31, 2016 Nope! But the best part of this story is his mask, which he had custom-made just for this occasion. \nThe mask Jorge Alves will wear tonight features his fellow equipment managers. Erik Huffine drew caricatures. Jorge painted it himself. pic.twitter.com/PHympx1LhC \n— Mike Sundheim (@MikeSundheim) December 31, 2016 Goalie, equipment guru and artist. Jorge Alves is a gem.
