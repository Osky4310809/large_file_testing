Reigns entered the Royal Rumble as the 30th, and last, competitor. Reigns had delighted the WWE universe earlier in the evening when he lost his world title match to Kevin Owens. Reigns defeat was all the sweeter for his detractors, because he seemed to have the match won. Reigns was certainly on top, before Braun Strowman appeared from nowhere to batter him. Reigns had a battering from Strowman, and was lying on a ringside table, when Owens slammed him to set up the win.\nThe Alamodome erupted in a course of boos when Reigns emerged as the final competitor to enter the Royal Rumble. Reigns then confirmed his place as the man the WWE universe loves to hate when he blindsided, and eliminated, The Undertaker. The fans were not amused, The Undertaker even less so. An epic stare down ensued, and it seemed that the WWE network had set up a match between the two for WrestleMania 33 in April. PW Mania , amongst others, have reported that the WrestleMania lineup has been leaked , and that a match between The Undertaker and Reigns is high on the bill.\n(Image by WWE) As reported in the Inquisitr recently, WWE rumors have been suggesting for some time , that Roman Reigns is set to take a heel turn. Reigns is already disliked by the WWE universe, he even managed to become the first WWE “face” to be voted as the world’s worst wrestler. It would make a great deal of sense for the WWE network to capitalize on Reigns unpopularity, by having him take a heel turn.\nIt seems obvious that a Reigns heel turn would be epic, especially if he used nefarious tactics to defeat The Undertaker at WrestleMania 33 . The problem for the WWE network, is that The Undertaker vs. Roman Reigns is a match that the fans just don’t want to see.\nWhy Don’t Fans Want To See Roman Reigns Vs. The Undertaker at ‘WrestleMania’ 33? The Undertaker is one of the most popular wrestlers of all time. He may be 51-years-old, but the WWE universe loves The Undertaker. Reigns is a relative newcomer, when compared with the Deadman. Reigns and his tag team partners, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins, have been pushed as the future of the WWE network for years, but the WWE universe just hasn’t warmed to Reigns.\nFans don’t want to see Reigns and The Undertaker battle it out at WrestleMania. A poll on the official WWE website shows that only nine percent of those who completed the poll want to see that match. It will be no surprise to see that most people want to see The Undertaker settle the score with 16-time World Champion John Cena.\n(Image by JP Yim/Getty Images) Cena and The Undertaker have fought five times. Both superstars have two wins, and the fifth contest ended with no result. The Undertaker has already undergone surgery on his hip, and it is widely reported that he may need a hip replacement. If that is the case, then 2017 is likely to be The Undertaker’s last year in WWE wrestling. Fans would love to see Cena and The Undertaker pitted against each other to split their tie, and 35 percent of those polled want to see that happen at WrestleMania 33 .\nInterestingly, 23 percent of those who completed the poll, would like to see The Undertaker battle with recently deposed champion AJ Styles. Styles is rumored to have a WrestleMania match lined up against Shane McMahon. That match seems scant reward for Styles, who held up the SmackDown brand almost singlehandedly for most of 2016.\nIf rumors suggesting that Bray Wyatt will win this weekend’s WWE Elimination Chamber are true, then a match against The Undertaker at WrestleMania 33, would be suitable compensation for Styles.\nThe WWE network likes to keep us on our toes by keeping us guessing, but perhaps it’s time for them to listen to the fans. The WWE universe does not want to see Roman Reigns taking on The Undertaker, they want to see John Cena and the Deadman at WrestleMania 33. \n[Image by WWE]\nWWE Rumors, News: The Undertaker Vs Roman Reigns Is The Match Fans Don’t Want is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:36:40.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
