Among their modus operandi: stealing user credentials that can be monetized in the underground , exploiting vulnerabilities, and more recently infecting systems with Trojans capable of pilfering the user’s financial and personal information.\nWhat other purposes can stolen Netflix credential serve? Offer them up as bargaining chip to fellow cybercriminals, for instance. Or more nefariously, use them as lure to trick certain users into installing malware (and turn a profit in the process). If you’re planning to free ride your way into binge-watching your favorite shows on Netflix, think again. Your computer’s files may end up getting held hostage instead.\nWe came across a ransomware (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_ NETIX.A ) luring Windows/PC users with a Netflix account via a login generator, one of the tools typically used in software and account membership piracy. These programs are usually found on suspicious websites sharing cracked applications and access to premium/paid web-based services.\n\nFigure 1.

The prompt window after clicking “Generate Login” \nScamming the Scammer \nThe ransomware starts as an executable ( Netflix Login Generator v1.1.exe ) that drops another copy of itself ( netprotocol.exe ) and then executed afterwards. Clicking the “Generate Login” button leads to another prompt window that purportedly has the login information of a genuine Netflix account. RANSOM_NETIX.A uses these fake prompts/windows as distraction while it performs its encryption routine on 39 file types under the C:\\Users directory:\n.ai, .asp, .aspx, .avi, .bmp, .csv, .doc, .docx, .epub, .flp, .flv, .gif, .html, .itdb, .itl, .jpg, .m4a, .mdb, .mkv, .mp3, .mp4, .mpeg, .odt, .pdf, .php, .png, .ppt, .pptx, .psd, .py, .rar, .sql, .txt, .wma, .wmv, .xls, .xlsx, .xml, .zip \nThe ransomware employs AES-256 encryption algorithm and appends the encrypted files with the .se extension. The ransom notes demand $100 worth of Bitcoin (0.18 BTC) from its victims, which is relatively cheaper compared to other families. It connects to its command and control (C&C) servers to send and receive information (customizing the ID number, for instance) as well download the ransom notes, one of which is displayed as a wallpaper in the infected machine. Interestingly, the ransomware terminates itself if the system is not running Windows 7 or Windows 10.\nBe Smarter \nMalefactors are diversifying the personal accounts they target. Phished Netflix accounts, for instance, are an attractive commodity because one can be used simultaneously by different IP addresses. In turn, the victim doesn’t immediately notice the fraud—as long as it’s not topping the device limit. This highlights the significance for end users to keep their subscription accounts safe from crooks. Keep to your service provider’s security recommendations . More importantly, practice good security habits : beware of emails you receive pretending to be legitimate, regularly update your credentials, use two-factor authentication, and download only from official sources.\nThe scam is also a reminder of the risks involved in pirating content—may they be movies, music, software, or paid memberships. Does getting your important files encrypted worth the piracy? Netflix’s premium plan costs around $12 per month, and allows content to be streamed in four devices at the same time. Compare that with $100 you need to pay in order to get your files decrypted. Getting them back isn’t guaranteed either, as other ransomware families have shown .\nBad guys need only hack a modicum of weakness for which no patch is available—the human psyche. Social engineering is a vital component in this scam, so users should be smarter: don’t download or click ads promising the impossible. If the deal sounds too good to be true, it usually is.\nTrend Micro Ransomware Solutions \nPROTECTION FOR ENTERPRISES \nEmail and Gateway Protection Trend Micro Cloud App Security , Trend Micro TM Deep Discovery TM Email Inspector and InterScan TM Web Security addresses ransomware in common delivery methods such as email and web.\nSpear phishing protection Malware Sandbox IP/Web Reputation Document exploit detection \nEndpoint Protection Trend Micro Smart Protection Suites detects and stops suspicious behavior and exploits associated with ransomware at the endpoint level.\nRansomware Behavior Monitoring Application Control Vulnerability Shielding Web Security \nNetwork Protection Trend Micro Deep Discovery Inspector detects malicious traffic, communications, and other activities associated with attempts to inject ransomware into the network.\nNetwork Traffic Scanning Malware Sandbox Lateral Movement Prevention \nServer Protection Trend Micro Deep Security TM detects and stops suspicious network activity and shields servers and applications from exploits.\nWebserver Protection Vulnerability Shielding Lateral Movement Prevention PROTECTION FOR SMALL-MEDIUM BUSINESSES AND HOME USERS \nProtection for Small-Medium Businesses Trend Micro Worry-Free TM Business Security Advanced offers cloud-based email gateway security through Hosted Email Security that can detect and block ransomware.\nRansomware behavior monitoring IP/Web Reputation \nProtection for Home Users Trend Micro Security 10 provides robust protection against ransomware by blocking malicious websites, emails, and files associated with this threat.\nIP/Web Reputation Ransomware Protection  \nRelated Hash: \n6ddc37ded7ab01e17e9c274b930d775a513db760 (SHA-1) — detected as RANSOM_ NETIX.A \nAdditional insights/analysis by David Sancho, Sylvia Lascano, and Edmark Dungca \nPost from: Trendlabs Security Intelligence Blog - by Trend Micro \nNetflix Scam Delivers Ransomware \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T04:11:55.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
