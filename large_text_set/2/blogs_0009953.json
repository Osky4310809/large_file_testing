Lillian objects to Lena's presence, but Lionel quickly overrules her and introduced Lena to her new family. \nLater on, Lena learns something that the audience didn't know when that scene first took place, but which makes perfect sense in context: Lena isn't just a child the wealthy, evil family decided to randomly adopt. She is a Luthor, the product of an affair between Lionel and Lena's mother, who passed away shortly before she was brought into the family fold. \n(We'll just leave you to ponder what the odds are Lionel or Lillian was behind her mother's death.) \nWhat's arguably most interesting about this is the fact that the final season of Smallville revealed that longtime supporting character Tess Mercer was in fact a Luthor , too. We had previously speculated about ties to Tess and Checkmate due to the footage of Lex and Lillian playing chess in the teaser for tonight's episode. \nThe fact that the Luthor portion of the episode ends with young Lena beating Lex at chess, using that piece and saying \"checkmate,\" well... \n...let's keep our eyes on that one, shall we?
