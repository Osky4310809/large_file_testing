Marco Rubio (R-FL) foresaw how the U.S. representatives at the United Nations would abandon Israel. In 2013, he spoke before Congress announcing how he could not support Samantha Power as UN ambassador because she, like many Obama appointees, had not renounced the UN's anti-Israel agenda. \nFast forward to December 2016 and Rubio's warnings proved to be right on the mark. This past week, the U.S. decided to abstain from a vote on Israeli settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, meaning that those settlements would be condemned. Trying to explain how the U.S. could leave Israel in the cold, Power said the vote is \"fully in line\" with how administrations have treated the Middle East issue in the past. WHOA! Watch @MarcoRubio 's 2013 speech stating the reasons why he opposes @AmbassadorPower 's nomination to the UN.She just proved him right! pic.twitter.com/CCN38xZLax â€” The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) December 30, 2016 \n\"We should be angry about the fact that for decades, more human rights criticism at the UN has been directed against Israel than against actual human rights violators,\" Rubio said at the time. He doubted the status quo would change under Power. Judging by this week's resolution, it hasn't. Secretary of State John Kerry made matters worse in his speech, explaining that a two-state solution was the \"only path to peace\" and criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government as the most extreme and right wing in Israel's history. So much for standing by the side of our Middle Eastern ally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T02:56:50.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
