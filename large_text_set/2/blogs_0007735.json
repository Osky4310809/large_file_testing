Tom Price, R-Ga. pauses while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington   Finance Committee on January 24, 2017. (Photo: Andrew Harnik,   President Trump's choice to be the top U.S. health official bought and sold health care company stocks often enough as a member of Congress to warrant probes by both federal securities regulators and the House ethics committee, former government ethics lawyers say. \nAn analysis of stock trade reports by Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., also shows he often misstated the timing of stock purchases or failed to report them altogether. \nThese include disclosures related to his much-publicized investment in the Australian biotech company Innate Immunotherapeutics, which gave him preferential treatment for a private stock offering he learned of through another member of Congress who is the company's biggest shareholder. \nPrice also invested in more health care companies that could benefit from legislation he introduced than previously reported. \nWhen asked about Price's stock trades, the Department of Health and Human Services released an unsigned statement that said Price's legislative activity on behalf of the medical equipment industry, which dates back about 20 years, illustrated his long-held concerns with the CMS' competitive bidding process. \nLast May, Price introduced the Patient Access to Durable Medical Equipment Act to block Medicare changes to reimbursements for durable medical equipment. A week later, he purchased up to $15,000 worth of shares in Blackstone, which owns the privately held home medical equipment company Apria. Apria sells home medical equipment, including walkers, hospital beds and wound therapy devices. \nApria spent up to $100,000 lobbying members of Congress to support Price’s bill between May and June. \nPrice's support of the industry, which has been targeted by HHS for fraud, was mutual. The American Association of Homecare, a home medical equipment lobbying and member organization, donated $7,200 to Price in 2016 and $7,000 in 2012. The organization filed six lobbying disclosure reports on this one bill — more than any other group. Apria is a corporate partner of the lobbying group. \nWhen Price was nominated to head HHS, the group released a statement applauding his work: “The home medical equipment community, as well as HME patients and their caregivers, owe him a debt of gratitude for his leadership and effectiveness on this issue.” \nUSA TODAY reported last week that Price bought $15,000 worth of stock in the health care company McKesson and soon after sponsored different legislation that would benefit the company, its clients and others involved in the durable medical equipment industry. \nThat put Price at risk of violating the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which was designed to keep members of Congress and their staffs from using information they have through their jobs to make money in the stock market. \n\"A lot of trades like this by someone in a position to have access to confidential information is exactly the kind of thing that typically triggers an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) investigation,\" says Richard Painter, who was President George W. Bush's chief ethics lawyer. \"I have no idea if it’s going on and where (a probe) would lead, but it shows extremely poor judgment making these trades in and out of health care stocks.\" \nPrice was approved by the Senate Finance Committee in a party-line vote last week. The full Senate is expected to vote on his nomination Thursday. \nPrice made dozens of health industry stock trades while he was a member of the Ways and Means Committee and the SEC was in the midst of a three-year investigation focusing on the panel, Kaiser Health News reported Wednesday . Although he was neither targeted by nor implicated in the the investigation, it was considered the first test of the STOCK law and unusually bold for a sitting member of Congress to do so, Kaiser reported. \nA coalition of 13 left-leaning groups sent a letter to Senate leaders Tuesday urging them to delay consideration of Price until the SEC can investigate. A rally is planned for Wednesday by these and other groups, along with Senate Democrats and at least one cancer patient concerned about losing coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which Price strongly opposes. \n\"Before the Senate rushes to confirm a nominee for the president’s cabinet, the public deserves to know whether they’re guilty of insider trading,\" said the letter signed by groups including the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Public Citizen. \"Mr. Price was a sitting Member of Congress actively working to pass health policy changes — to accept special stock offers from a health care company in that position was not ethical and not appropriate.” \nBut as Painter's comments show, the criticism isn't only coming from the left. \n\"This is something the voters should be concerned about,\" says John Pudner, a conservative Republican who runs Take Back Our Republic, an advocacy group trying to get money out of politics. \"Money that is personally benefiting you is more of a concern and can be a more powerful force pulling you into a decision on related issues than campaign funding.\" \nIn his Senate confirmation hearings, Price said he personally directed the January 2015 purchases of stock in Innate Immunotherapeutics, He insisted that his broker handled all of his other direct stock holdings and did not consult him on those transactions. However, in Price’s self-reported periodic transaction report filed in February 2015, Price said he was informed of the Innate trades about a month after the transaction took place — even though he directed them himself. This illustrates that Price misstated the timing of two out of three of his most controversial investments. \nRead more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T18:27:56.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
