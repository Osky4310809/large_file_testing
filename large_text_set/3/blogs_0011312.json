Claire Short took to Twitter to brag about her prom date running 5.5 miles as his way of asking her. He must have mapped that out really good because looking at the GPS he didn’t get lost once. 2 \nHe ran a pattern in order to spell out “Prom” and I’m assuming he ran all the way to her house and showed her his great achievement immediately after.
