Singhbury's Local in Aylesbury Twitter/@stephen_jury \nA shopkeeper claims he has had to remove the sign from the front of his store afer Sainsbury's complained it looked too similar to theirs. \nThe supermarket giant is said to have objected to the orange sign adorning Singhbury's Local in Aylesbury. \nCo-owner Inderjit Singh Nagpal said there was a simple explanation for his choice of sign and shop's name. He told the BBC 'Singh' is his middle name, 'bury' is a reference to Aylesbury and the colour choice is due to the importance of orange to Sikhs. \nThe sign was removed in October after first being put in place the previous year. \nSainsbury's said customers had \"raised concerns\" over the shopfront. \nA spokeswoman told the BBC: \"There were no legal proceedings around this but we did contact the owners after customers raised their concerns with us.\" \nMr Nagpal said he would not change the name of his shop and hoped a compromise decision could be reached soon.
