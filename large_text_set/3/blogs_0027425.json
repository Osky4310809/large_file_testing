TIFs are special purpose districts in which the City of Dallas and Dallas County reinvest property tax revenue back into the zone through infrastructure improvements to encourage economic development. \nAlthough TIFs bring new commercial and retail projects to underserved areas of the city, they can also decrease the availability of affordable housing in adjacent neighborhoods. This unintended consequence could irreparably harm some of the city's most historic neighborhoods, like La Bajada in West Dallas. \nWidespread displacement of longtime West Dallas residents would be disastrous, adding to the city's affordable housing crisis. Despite having one of the highest poverty rates in the country, Dallas has too few affordable housing units for our poorest and most vulnerable residents.

TIFs are authorized and regulated by the state's tax code and can therefore be amended through state law with special provisions to ensure that economic development benefits both old and new residents. \nHouse Bill 2480 seeks to address the negative effects of gentrification through several mechanisms, specifically by providing property tax relief, proportional infrastructure spending, and relocation assistance to longtime residents in neighborhoods within and adjacent to TIFs in low-income areas like West Dallas. \nNew development within a TIF can significantly raise the property taxes of working-class families to the point that they can no longer afford to stay in the neighborhood. Under the proposed bill, a portion of total TIF funds would be set aside to construct affordable housing and provide much-needed property tax abatements to many working families. Additionally, House Bill 2480 encourages the use of a tool called \"market segmentation,\" that allows newer or redeveloped properties in a neighborhood to be appraised differently than older homes. This tool is already being utilized successfully by the Travis County Appraisal District in gentrifying areas of Austin. \nFurthermore, House Bill 2480 ensures that existing communities benefit from redevelopment through a tool called \"proportional infrastructure spending.\" The concept is that large-scale infrastructure expenditures should be stepped-down and connected to neighborhood-level infrastructure projects. For example, the $182 million Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge and the $10 million deck park on the decommissioned Kirk Pedestrian Bridge were built adjacent to the La Bajada neighborhood. While these improvements have certainly increased economic development, the residents of La Bajada say what they need most are repairs to a neighborhood park, internal streets and the roof of a local community center. The bill would set aside up to 20 percent of TIF funds to be used for general infrastructure improvements for neighborhood-level projects like these that enhance the area and demonstrate the city's commitment to the existing community.

The City of Dallas recently adopted minimum habitability standards for residential housing units, such as single family rental properties. If the bill is enacted, the City of Dallas would be required to develop and adopt a plan to provide for the relocation of tenants displaced as a result of the implementation of those standards. This is critical in places like West Dallas where hundreds of families are being displaced following the enforcement of the new city housing code. \nWe are proud to be working together to encourage long-term affordability and equitable economic development in our city and hope you will join us in supporting this crucial piece of legislation. Please consider reaching out to your state legislators and encouraging them to support House Bill 2480. \nEric Johnson is a Democrat representing parts of Dallas and Mesquite in the Texas Legislature and co-chair of the Dallas Area Legislative Delegation.
