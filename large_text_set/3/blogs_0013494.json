I have a great respect for people who turn their lives around, and I think that everyone makes mistakes in life, and I think the real proof of what kind of human being you are is what you do with that mistake. He’s educated himself. He’s done philanthropic work now, and I think that actions speak very loudly … and his actions have helped a lot of people.”\nGibson has made a comeback as of late, making appearances at award shows where his film received a bevy of nominations . He recently announced he has been sober for 10 years , and sources previously told PEOPLE that he has worked hard on turning his life around.\n“Mel has showed some remorse over his past behavior,” said the source. “He was very stubborn about it for a long time. He now realizes that it was a distraction from his work. Mel wants to be remembered for his work. He has worked on his issues and has definitely shaped up.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:05:59.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
