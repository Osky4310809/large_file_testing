She's tough and she posts as well. She's a jack-of-all-trades, so I expect that from her all the time and she does it instinctively.\" \nPollard added another 3-pointer to end the quarter. She scored 15 of the Millers' first 18 points as they led 18-9 after a quarter. \nMilford Mill (9-1) continued to strike in spurts through the second quarter, thanks in large part to the defensive intensity that, along with Pollard's offense, sparked the early run and continued to give City problems. \nBrowse pictures from the 21st annual Baltimore City Public Schools Basketball Academy, held Jan. 12 to Jan. 14, 2017. \nAfter halftime, the Millers extended their lead to as big as 56-27. Pollard fed Jasmine Lane for a layup and then hit a follow shot to run the lead to 24. Jone' Ayers, who finished with 10 points, added two free throws for the biggest margin of the game with eight seconds left in the third quarter. \nCity, whose other two losses were to No. 3 Howard and No. 4 Western, cut into Milford Mill leads several times during the game. But the Millers still led by 24 with 4:56 remaining before City closed out with a 15-2 run. \n\"We went on a couple spurts trying to get it within 10, coming back, but we just could never get it to that mark,\" Contee said. \"They just turned the intensity up. They played us in a man the whole game. They didn't press us, but the turnovers just killed us — consistent back-to-back turnovers, throwing the ball away.\" \nRaquel Nicholson led the Knights with 14 points while Jaida Ford added 10. \nThis could be the first of two meetings between the Baltimore City-Baltimore County rivals this winter. They're in the same section in the Class 3A North region and could meet again in the playoffs. \nBoth teams were scheduled to play again Saturday at the Basketball Academy, but those games have been postponed until next Saturday at Morgan State. With the icy forecast, Baltimore City, Baltimore County and several other school districts canceled weekend activities, forcing the games to be postponed. \nThe Millers are scheduled to play No. 14 Poly on Jan. 21. City will meet Mount Carmel and Western will play New Town. \ntwitter.com/kdunnsun \nM—Lane 2, Maka.Pollard 2, King 2, Hughes 12, Make.Pollard 33, Ayers 10, Lewis 4.
