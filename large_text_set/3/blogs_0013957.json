Following the tons of leaks in recent days, we’re getting another one that reveals the official Galaxy S8 event poster. As you can see in the image below, the poster shows an outline of the edge-to-edge design of the Galaxy S8, with a large S in the middle to drive home the point that we’re looking at a Galaxy S device. \nThe poster also confirms that the S8 will be made available sometime in April. Recent information points to an April 28th release date , with the US and South Korea possibly getting it a week early (something that has become the norm for Samsung’s flagships in recent years). Pre-orders in South Korea could begin as early as April 7th , although we will only see confirmed information on availability following the official launch on March 29th.
