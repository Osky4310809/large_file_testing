They say what they did is just one of many things planned to stop the project. \n“The Dakota Access Pipeline is just one of many threats faced by native communities across the country,” Holiday said. \nHoliday and Zimmerman say their actions on New Year’s Day helped bring attention to a protest that has pitted indigenous people against investors of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline would move oil from North Dakota,through South Dakota and Iowa, ending in Illinois. \n“The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers denied the permit to drill under the Missouri River,” Zimmerman said. “However, with the incoming presidential administration, the threat is not gone and our fight is hardly over.” \nSo the pair took their fight to the air, high above fans and players inside U.S. Bank Stadium. Their high-flying act eventually landed them in jail, booked on probable cause of burglary charges. \n“The attending judge at the court, after reviewing the police report, determined there is not sufficient evidence to hold us on burglary charges,” Zimmerman said. \nThe pair was released from jail without any charges. Carolyn Feldman, 27, was also booked and released by the judge without charges. Zimmerman says people can expect to see more protests like this. \n“To get the message out about the pipeline, they are happening all the time and they are going to continue happening until the project is finally stopped,” he said. \nTwo of the three people arrested New Year’s Day were also involved in a similar incident back in 2013. Carolyn Feldman and Sen Holiday were arrested and charged with trespassing after dangling over the side of the Washington Avenue Bridge. The stunt included a giant “Post-It” note to protest 3M’s environmental practices. \nZimmerman and Holiday say they expect to face charges at some point. In the incident in 2013, Holiday and Feldman were charged with two misdeanors. Both paid a $378 fine. Reg Chapman facebook Follow Reg Chapman joined WCCO-TV in May of 2009.
