Snopes tried to combine these claims and labeled them as “false.” \n“While some Democrats may not have stood and applauded as much as their Republican counterparts did, (Schultz and Ellison) did indeed all stand in acknowledgment of Mrs. Owens when she was introduced by President Trump,” Snopes reported. \nThe key here is the phrasing of the sentence: “when she was introduced.” Yes, they stood when she was introduced, but during the second, and longer, ovation, they didn’t stand.   \nHotAir noted that Snopes significantly revised its story after initially labeling the claim as “unproven.” Snopes ignored some of the key evidence proving that Schultz and Ellison were sitting during the ovation, and tried to throw around as much detail as possible in the hopes of confusing its readers. \nIn fact, photos of the exact moment were posted on Twitter showing that Schultz and Ellison were not, in fact, standing during at least part of the ovation. Proof that DWS & Ellison stood for the first ovation & not for the 2nd.
