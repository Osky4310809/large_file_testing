You just have to take the time to sit down and talk. \n\"My comeback at Marseille is the eternal question for more than 12 years now. Every time I respond, and people say I'm just talking. But you let a player go, and financially he is making a good living since then, and now you want him to come back and divide his salary in two? \n\"And after that, you say he doesn't like Marseille. Who works to earn less? No one. \n\"I would like to come back as a player. I even did what was necessary to make it happen. But I can't force the board to bring me back.\" \nDespite his advancing years and a frustrating end to his time in Montreal, Drogba is confident he still has something to give to a club in Europe. \nAs he considers a potential future off it, however, he is also thinking about joining a club where he could progress into an off-the-field role when his playing days do come to an end. \n\"I want to play,\" he added. \"I still have my legs and I'm still like a kid with the ball. My knee got a bit annoyed [last season] but I feel good. \n\"It would also allow me to create a smooth transition [into a post-playing career].\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T03:45:01.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
