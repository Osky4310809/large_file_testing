Since the start of the 2014-15 season, The Blazers are 7-4 against the Thunder and, more importantly, are 2-1 against them in 2016-17. Despite Portlandâ€™s edge, the Blazers (No. 9 in the West) are currently looking up at the Thunder (No. 7 seed) in the standings. With less than 40 days before the playoffs tip, this game could key how the lower half of the playoff bracket shapes up. \nNEW ADDITION Since the offseason departure of Kevin Durant, the bulk of OKC's offensive burden has been placed on Russell Westbrook. The dynamic guard not only leads the team in scoring, but also rebounds and assists. Thunder management acknowledged the need to surround Westbrook with more firepower for the stretch run by acquiring former Chicago Bulls forwards Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott at the trade deadline . OKC went 3-0 start with the new pieces and they also signed backup point guard Norris Cole to help free Westbrook from ball handling duties. However, OKC is 0-3 since Cole joined the team. \nHOME IMPROVEMENT The Thunder enter tonight's game having lost three straight on the road, but thankfully they are much a much better team when playing at home this season. OKC is 12-2 at home since Christmas Day and has six of its next eight games at Chesapeake Energy Arena, which could help the Thunder rise in the Western Conference standings. \nTRIPLE RUSSELL For most of this season, the term \"triple-double\" has been synonymous with Westbrook. Through 63 games, he is averaging a triple-double (31.7 points per game, 10.6 rebounds per game, 10 assists per game) and leads the NBA with 30 triple-doubles overall . However, he hasn't had a triple-double in three straight games. He will look to avoid completing four straight games without recording a triple-double since a five-game span earlier this season (Nov. 2-9). If the streak ends, Westbrook will tie Wilt Chamberlain for the second most triple-doubles recorded in a season. \nMost Triple-Doubles (Single Season)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:10:21.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
