No one has accused Flynn of engaging in any illegal activity. The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy. Very un-American! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 \nThe president praised Bloomberg View reporter Eli Lake for recognizing this aspect of the story. Thank you to Eli Lake of The Bloomberg View –\"The NSA & FBI…should not interfere in our politics…and is\" Very serious situation for USA \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 \nLake characterized the leaking of transcripts of private phone conversations by the intelligence community to undermine the new administration as “police state” tactics: i.e., like something Russia would do. \n“Normally intercepts of U.S. officials and citizens are some of the most tightly held government secrets,” he explained. “This is for good reason. Selectively disclosing details of private conversations monitored by the FBI or NSA gives the permanent state the power to destroy reputations from the cloak of anonymity. This is what police states do.” \nLake continued, “In the past it was considered scandalous for senior U.S. officials to even request the identities of U.S. officials incidentally monitored by the government (normally they are redacted from intelligence reports).” \nThe reporter concluded that Flynn’s resignation was really a “political assassination.” \nTrump stated in a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday that Flynn was “treated very, very unfairly by the media.” . @realDonaldTrump says that Michael Flynn has been treated \"very very unfairly\" by the \"fake media\" https://t.co/0wzaeCjLQ1 \n— Sky News (@SkyNews) February 15, 2017 \nHe added the leaking stories are being perpetrated by those, presumably in the government and the media, who don’t like the election results and want to “cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.” What do you think?
