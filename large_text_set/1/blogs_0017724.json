It will be recalled that in April 2015, the state House of Assembly impeached Olanusi following the recommendation of the panel presided over by Stanley Olaniyi which recommended him for impeachment having defected from the then ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to All Progressives Congress(APC). \nOlanusi, through his counsel, Chief Adeniyi Akintola, SAN, filed the suit challenging the impeachment. However, in his ruling, Justice Williams Olamide, who presided over the case at an Ondo State High Court, threw out the suit on the ground that it was initiated through writ of summons instead of originating summons. \nNot satisfied, Olanusi proceeded to the Court of Appeal, asking it to upturn the verdict \nOlanusi, in his grounds of appeal, stated that the lower court erred in not holding that the appellant’s suit ought not to have commenced by way of originating summons. \nIn the brief of argument, he said there were no facts in dispute that could warrant the suit to be inappropriate for originating summons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T01:09:02.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
