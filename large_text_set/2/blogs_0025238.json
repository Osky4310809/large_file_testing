Particularly, while we've known that Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) will die since the early episodes of the first season, the cause of his demise has been an ongoing mystery. Of course fan theories predicting exactly how, why, and when said demise will occur have been mounting—but thanks to last week's episode, there's now added evidence to corroborate one of the most popular ones. And yep, it's pretty heartbreaking. \nSPOILERS AHEAD. \nHere's the latest. \nLast week's episode , which aired on February 21, was as equally touching as it was devastating. In a standout scene, Randall (Sterling K. Brown) comforted his biological father, William (Ron Cephas Jones), as he lost his battle to cancer. As if this weren't heart-wrenching enough, rewind to the scene where Randall was adamant that he wanted a nurse in his father's room during his passing to ensure his father didn't \"die when nobody's lookin'.\" \nAside from the fact Randall was the one by his father's side, this remark resonated with viewers for yet another reason. His specific remark—\"Die when nobody's lookin'\"—gives credence to an extremely popular fan theory we discussed earlier about Jack's death: that he died alone. \nWhy else was Randall so determined to have William pass with someone else's presence? Why did Randall's tone exude guilt and anxiety? Could it be because Rebecca (Mandy Moore) was on tour when Jack passed, and he actually did die alone? \nWe don't know what to believe or if we even want to believe it. But one thing is for sure, we'll be tuning in for Tuesday's episode, tissues in hand.
