Fun! In a statement posted to Facebook last night , HITS 105FM (“And the beat goes on!”) cited Madonna’s use of the word “fuck” as well as her comments about thinking about blowing up the White House (which she has since clarified) in their decision to pull her music from their station. The Facebook post states: General Manager of HITS 105, Terry Thomas, says “banning all Madonna songs at HITS 105 is not a matter of politics, it’s a matter of patriotism. It just feels wrong to us to be playing Madonna songs and paying her royalties when the artist has shown un-American sentiments. If all stations playing Madonna took their lead from us, that would send a powerful economic message to Madonna.” Quite the punishment from the station which, according to their Facebook account, plays “the greatest hits of the 60s, 70s and 80s” and according to their cover photo, even offers 50 minutes of commercial free music all day long. I mean, Madonna can be problematic as fuck, but come on now. Guess they won’t be playing any of her material, girl . She’s been frozen out. They’re saying, “ Bye bye, baby ,” to her records. It seems like Madonna used to be a regular at Hits 105 FM, but now they’re just treating her like a beautiful stranger . It’s no secret that the woman is outspoken and regularly courts controversy, so don’t tell me this ban is about anything but punishment for her decision to stand up for women. They’re just looking for a bad girl to make an example out of, seeing as blatant misogyny is so in vogue . Madonna should thank her lucky star that this has happened, honestly! It’s great publicity. She may have to beg, or say something like a prayer or even sacrifice something like a virgin to get her music back on Hits 105 FM, but I’m sure she’ll just find another place entirely to express [her]self instead of this ONE RADIO STATION. Still, Hits 105 FM should really take a bow for being so committed to a deeper and deeper form of mindless so-called “patriotism.” Let’s be real, though: nothing really matters because Trump’s probably going to get us nuked off the face of the planet anyway, so why not just open your heart , Hits 105 FM? It’s only human nature . Story Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:15:41.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
