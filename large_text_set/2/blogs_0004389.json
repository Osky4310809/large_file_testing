What to expect then is anyone’s guess. But it would be surprising if Trump actually wanted a reversal of the Fed’s pro-growth low-rates policy now that he is president — and has promised a growth rate of 4% for the US economy that economists of all political stripes see as highly improbable.\nTrump is also likely to face resistance on regulatory changes from the Fed as well since most officials championed the extensive new regulations and are still in the process of implementing many of the rules involved.\nThis is an opinion column.
