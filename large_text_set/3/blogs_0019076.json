But we’ll see what happens.:” \nThe unfinished business would be their match on the final day of Ryder Cup play last October. After a front nine where the two combined for seven birdies and an eagle, Reed broke McIlroy with a birdie on 12 and held on for a 1-up victory. The Americans would go on to a 17-11 victory, their first over the Europeans since 2008. \nIn Austin for Match Play, McIlroy and Reed would not meet until the weekend if they both make it that far. \n“I feel like we both play well in this format of the game,” McIlroy said. “He’s played well in match play, especially in the Ryder Cup. If it came down to that and we were to face each other Saturday or Sunday that would be awesome. Something I’d really look forward to, to try to beat him and beat him by more than one hole, just so I have a little bit of an edge. It’s sort of the way it is. \n“But getting beaten in singles Sunday of the Ryder Cup stings. But it was a pleasure to be a part of that match because of the people will remember that for a long time. I wasn’t on the winning side of it, but it was cool to be a part of. If we could do that again that would be cool.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:47:17.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
