When he was at his prime, no-one could touch him.\" Image copyright Mac TV Image caption Benny Lynch (right) starts to dominate Small Montana in 1937 \nLynch managed 119 fights in his short career. \nHe won the world flyweight title in 1935 when he beat Jackie Brown in Manchester, reportedly flooring his opponent eight times before the bout was stopped in the second round. \nJim Watt, who became lightweight world champion 40 years later in 1979, tells the documentary: \"Benny is the most important figure as far as Scottish boxing is concerned. \n\"He was the first one to do it. He showed us that a little guy from Glasgow, a little guy from Scotland, could be champion of the whole wide world.\" \nThe film's producer says Lynch was already massively popular in Glasgow before he became world champion. \nHe says: \"There were 2,000 Scots at the fight in Manchester and the place was pandemonium when he won. \n\"When he came back up to Glasgow, the estimates range from between 20,000 and 100,000 at Central Station. \n\"It was phenomenal the turnout and the regard that people had for Benny.\" Image copyright Mac TV \nMr Mactaggart says that Benny's problems began soon after he won the world title. \nHe says: \"There was a guy called Sammy Wilson who discovered Benny as a young lad and really mentored him. \n\"He was almost a father figure to him. He took him all the way through and then unfortunately there was a spilt with Sammy just after he won the world championship. \n\"Although he went on and was successful after, for Benny you got the feeling that without Sammy as a safe pair of hands and a person in his corner he was a bit lost.\" Image copyright Mac TV \nLynch established himself as the \"undisputed\" flyweight champion of the world when he narrowly beat Small Montana in London in 1937. \nBut Mr Mactaggart says the pinnacle of his career was swiftly followed by a decline. \n\"Once you have the world title you have everything you wanted,\" he says. \n\"The feeling was that his hunger went and other distractions came along. \n\"There were also people who came along looking for a piece of Benny and it was not good for him. There was not someone there to protect him like Sammy Wilson had in the past.\" \nBy the following year, Lynch's drinking lifestyle meant that he could no longer make the weight for the flyweight division. \nHe forfeited his title against American Jackie Jurich because he was overweight. \nHis last fight was against Aurel Toma in London in October 1938. \nIt was the first time he had ever been knocked out.

It was where he felt most comfortable. Without that it became much more difficult for him.\" \nLynch made attempts to dry out, spending time in a monastery in Ireland, but died from malnutrition-induced respiratory failure in 1946, at the age of 33.
