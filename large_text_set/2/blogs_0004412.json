It was stunning, nothing short of breathtaking, and reminded everyone of why Gaga is one of the all-time greats.\nWell, reminded almost everyone, anyway. No one was more stunned by Gaga’s performance than Roseanne Barr , who — like millions of Americans — was watching the big game. These days Barr mostly uses Twitter to tweet conspiracy theories or support of Donald Trump (which are not necessarily mutually exclusive), but Sunday night Barr took to Twitter in admiration of Gaga, who she says she had apparently never heard of before.\nlady gaga rocks wow i never heard of her b4! she is great!\n— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) February 6, 2017 \n\nAfter being quickly and playfully lambasted by her followers, because — how? why? wait, really ? — Barr took the opportunity to poke some fun at herself.\n\nwho is this lady gaga woman? she is great! pic.twitter.com/QyxBYTU7Kj \n— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) February 6, 2017 \n@DrWouldyalika i am not a girl. im an old woman.\n— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) February 6, 2017 \na world where young ppl call me 'girl' gawwwwd.\n— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) February 6, 2017 \n\nShe also made a comparison that Lady Gaga probably never gets tired of hearing .\nthat lady gaga ws just wonderful! She ws kinda like th anti madonna. no huge satanic imagery or anything she did beaver shot her parents tho\n— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) February 6, 2017 \n\nWe must have all missed the beaver shot though. Pretty sure people would have had some Things To Say about a wardrobe malfunction of that magnitude.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:31:21.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
