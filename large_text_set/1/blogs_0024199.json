Watch | Former soldier: Baseless war crimes investigations are 'ruining lives' 01:41 \nT he Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal today (MON), heard Mr Shiner admitted he would be struck off for his misconduct, but had refused to attend proceedings and was “manoeuvring” to avoid a hearing. \nMr Shiner has already admitted nine counts of behaving without integrity and a single account of acting recklessly, but faces more serious charges of acting dishonestly. \nAs a three week hearing began in his absence, Andrew Tabachnik, counsel to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, said: “What is at the heart of Prof Shiner’s professional misconduct is a view on his part that the ends justified the means, that his work in the human rights field was of such moment that he was able to disregard the rules that apply to his fellow solicitors. \n“This prosecution is not about stopping solicitors representing unpopular clients. It’s about solicitors who think the ends justify the means and that the rules don’t apply to them.” FAQ | Iraq Historic Allegations Team \nT he three man tribunal panel chaired by Nicola Lucking heard British troops had been ambushed by Iraqi insurgents in May 2004 in what became known as the Battle of Danny Boy. \nSoldiers took 20 of the dead for identification and nine captives. The bodies were released to families the next day and the captives were transferred to Iraqi police. \nRumours began to circulate that many of the dead had been taken alive and then killed. Mr Shiner was alerted to the allegations by a journalists three years later and secured legal aid to bring a judicial review, which led to the Al Sweady Inquiry. \nCol James Coote, who was at the time a major commanding British troops during the battle, said the experience of his men facing baseless allegations had tarnished his image of the British legal profession. \nHe said the allegations were “the most serious to be brought against the British Army since the Second World War and had a very serious effect on morale”. \nHe said: “I remember my sense of anger and dismay following the publication of these allegations.” \nHe said the process of the inquiry had been “thoroughly unpleasant and demeaning and led to the return of some of the symptoms I had suffered on my return from Iraq”. \nThe tribunal continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T16:36:40.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
