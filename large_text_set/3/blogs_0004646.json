Rumours are now doing the rounds that she is dating her show’s co-star, Pearl Puri . The duo reportedly kept bumping into each other at various events and soon developed a connection. \nHowever, Karishma reacted to the rumours and told TellyChakkar : \nI want to date Brad Pitt since he and me both are single, hope you got the answer. \nPearl also denied the rumours, saying: \nThere is nothing like that. I am used to this thing where every actress I hang out with or even talk to, is linked with me. Apparently, whenever I am with my co-star or even any other actress from the industry, I am dating all of them. Still, I would like to clarify that I am not dating anyone. \nWell, okay then!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:56:51.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
