Some twelve months after announcing the takeover of Cafe Cordiale in Sherman Oaks, chef/restaurateur Aaron Robins is ready to reveal SOCA , his new upscale dinner destination with big Valley plans.\nStep inside the wood-steeped interior, and youâ€™ll find the sort of adult dinner destination more commonly associated with Beverly Hills or West Hollywood. But this is Ventura Boulevard, which is leading the most recent culinary charge for folks on the other side of the hill.\nSOCA hopes to be a highlight within that movement, a sit-down evening restaurant with the right amount of dim lighting and comfortable seating. The place is all wood and leather, with hanging bulbs, a gorgeous bar, and one unbelievably sophisticated patio experience. Outside awnings can be pulled up or down depending on the needs of the night, with the ambient glow from the latticework look creating one supremely stunning finished vision.\nOn the food and beverage side, expect Robins (known in the Valley as the man behind Boneyard Bistro ) to show off some refined global fare, with an emphasis on Latin and Mediterranean flavors. Partner Rory Snipes lands as GM of the 70-seat dining room and 28-seat patio, while the casual L-shaped bar provides bottles, wines by the glass, and a powerful gin-backed cocktail menu.\nSOCA opens March 7, keeping hours from 5 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday to start. Call the restaurant at 818-301-4300 to make reservations.\nSOCA \n14015 Ventura Blvd. \nSherman Oaks, CA \nWonho Frank Lee ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:52:05.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
