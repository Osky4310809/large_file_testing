Toddler with Down’s syndrome lands Matalan modelling contract \n\"We were in a play centre here in Nenagh and I took my eyes off him for about five seconds as he walked towards the claw machine,” father Damien told the Irish Independent . \n“I then heard a muffled complaint and when I looked up, he was behind the glass of the machine. \n\"I tried to get him out, but it seemed like he did not have enough space to manoeuvre his way out, so I told him to be calm and wait while I got one of the staff to find the keys to the machine.\" \nMr Murphy said an off-duty fire fighter also happened to be in the building came to Jamie’s rescue. Unintentionally terrifying children's movies Unintentionally terrifying children's movies 1/7 \nMost people know to steer well clear of this one by now. If not, you obviously escaped one of the most scarring childhood memories, that of cute baby Bambi’s mother being shot dead by hunters, leaving him sad and alone in the woods. Rex Features 2/7 \nUrsula makes a pact with mermaid Ariel that she will make her human in return for her voice. Her voice! She must then get a man to fall in love with her, without being able to speak. Every feminist’s nightmare. 3/7 \nThis one is seriously trippy. It’s Disney’s third ever movie but instead of pretty dresses and Prince Charmings and happily ever afters, all we got was a visit to Satan’s lair in ‘Night on Bald Mountain’. 4/7 \nThat fairground is enough to put you off any old-fashioned fun for life. It’s called Pleasure Island but there is absolutely zero pleasure involved whatsoever. Naughty boys are turned into donkeys and the whole wooden puppet coming alive thing doesn’t really do it for us either. 5/7 \nThere are plenty of frankly horrifying moments in this supposed children’s film from 1941, but none so harrowing as the scene when Dumbo visits his imprisoned, supposedly mad mummy elephant and she sings him a lullaby while cradling him in her trunk. 6/7 \nThis ‘movie about bunnies’ may look cute enough but Watership Down is proof that animation does not equal adorable. It’s possibly the most traumatic film you’ll have seen in, well, forever. It’s really bloody in parts and should quite clearly never have been rated a U, even in 1978. 7/7 \nTiny Thumbelina is kidnapped by toads shortly after birth, nearly drowns in a waterfall, betrothed to a blind old mole who lives underground, forced to dress as a bug and dance at a freaky insect ball, spanked by Mr Beetle with a cane and her lover Prince Cornelius is frozen in an ice block. Oh and her best friend nearly dies. Lovely. \nThe fire fighter instructed the toddler where to move and was then able to pull him from the machine \nJamie's father said he had a knack for getting into mischievous situations and managed to remain relatively calm throughout the experience - adding that he also got to keep two toys he picked up while inside.
