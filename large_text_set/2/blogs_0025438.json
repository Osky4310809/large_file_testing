The Swans have actually won two of their past three away games in the Premier League and it took a last-minute goal from Gabriel Jesus to beat them last time out at Man City. Young centre-back Alfie Mawson has been a surprise source of inspiration for Swansea recently, with three goals in his past six games. Jim’s prediction: Business as usual for Chelsea. Home win. Getty Images Sam Allardyce is under pressure at Palace with just one League win since taking charge \nCrystal Palace v Middlesbrough (3pm) \nA win for Palace would draw them level with Middlesbrough, currently 16th, on 22 points. Defeat would leave them six points adrift of Boro and floundering in the drop zone. It’s a tall order for Sam Allardyce’s team. Just one win in their past 11 Prem games and only two goals scored in the last five of those matches do not hint at a revival. Boro might have just one away win to boast of this term, but they have also drawn six of their 12 matches on the road. Jim’s prediction: Boro to stifle the game and claim a point. \nEverton v Sunderland (3pm) \nEverton, unbeaten in five matches, have scored 10 goals in their past two games at Goodison Park with the crazy 6-3 win over Bournemouth – and a four-goal masterclass from Romelu Lukaku – being a treat for everybody bar the visiting supporters. Sunderland’s results make grim reading, with only one W recorded in 2017. That, though, was from their previous away trip: a 4-0 victory at Crystal Palace. Jim’s prediction : Maybe not a nine-goal thriller, but Everton to win it. \nHull City v Burnley (3pm) \nHull have demonstrated plenty of fighting spirit and an upturn in form under new boss Marco Silva and have won all four home games since he arrived, with scalps including Liverpool in the League and Manchester United in the EFL Cup. Burnley have the division’s worst away record, with one point from 11 matches. Jim’s prediction: Hull to keep their spirits up with a win. Assist machine Matt Philips has laid on more goals than any other West Brom player this season \nWest Brom v Bournemouth (3pm) \nTony Pulis continues to get the best out of his West Brom players as they enjoy life in the top half of the table. One of their surprise heroes is £5m wideman Matt Phillips, who is second only to Man City’s Kevin De Bruyne in terms of assists this season (De Bruyne has provided nine, Phillips is joint-second with eight). Bournemouth are in danger of getting their noses bashed in the relegation scrap after four defeats and a draw from their past five games. Jim’s prediction: Baggies to keep on bouncing. Home win. \nWatford v West Ham (5.30pm) \nWest Ham led 2-0 just after the half hour mark of their clash at the London Stadium in September. By full-time Watford had won their first game of the season, 4-2. The Irons have won their past two away games and have scored more goals on their travels than they have at the new stadium (20 vs 14), but are not the same without big Andy Carroll up front. Jim’s prediction : Watford to win it. \nSunday, February 26 \nTottenham v Stoke (1.30pm) \nSpurs remain the only team not to have lost a Prem home game this season and the last team to hold them to a draw at the Lane was Leicester back in October. Stoke have taken four points from their past two visits to Tottenham. For them, 36-year-old Peter Crouch has enjoyed his run in the starting XI, scoring four goals in his past eight games. Jim’s prediction: Tottenham’s midweek Euro trip to cause some heavy legs, Stoke to claim a draw. \nEFL CUP FINAL \nManchester United v Southampton (4.30pm) \nJim’s prediction: Zlatan marches on and Jose Mourinho collects his first silverware as Man United boss. \nMonday, February 27 \nLeicester v Liverpool (8pm) \nChampions Leicester have slumped to one point above the drop zone. They have lost their past five Prem games, have won only a single match out of the past nine played in all competitions and haven’t scored a single goal in the League in 2017 so far. That’s why Claudio Ranieri was sacked. Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Spurs in their previous run out was their first in the Prem this year. Senegal striker Sadio Mane’s double strike in that game means he has scored five goals in his past seven matches for club and country. Jim’s prediction: Liverpool to heap more misery on the Foxes with an away win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T11:19:12.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
