James was joined by Cavs teammate Kyrie Irving (No. 4) near the top of the list. The only other team with three players in the top 15 was the New York Knicks with Kristaps Porzingis (No. 7), Derrick Rose (No. 10), and Carmelo Anthony (No. 15). \nThe 15 players with the most jersey sales:\n1. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors\n2. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers\n3. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors\n4. Kyrie Irving, Cleveland Cavaliers\n5. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder\n6. Dwyane Wade, Chicago Bulls\n7. Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks\n8. Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio Spurs\n9. Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls\n10. Derrick Rose, New York Knicks\n11. Klay Thompson, Golden State Warriors\n12. James Harden, Houston Rockets\n13. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers\n14. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks\n15. Carmelo Anthony, New York Knicks\nAs for which teams had the highest number of jersey sales, the top two comes as no surprise with the Warriors and Cavs in the top two spots. However, the third team on the jersey sale list comes as a bit of a surprise after looking at the player list as the Lakers are No. 3, likely due to the sales of Kobe Bryant jerseys and other retros that don’t count towards the current player numbers. The Bulls and Knicks round out the top 5 in team sales. \nThe top 10 teams in jersey sales:\n1. Golden State Warriors\n2. Cleveland Cavaliers\n3. Los Angeles Lakers\n4. Chicago Bulls\n5. New York Knicks\n6. San Antonio Spurs\n7. Oklahoma City Thunder\n8. Boston Celtics\n9. Philadelphia 76ers\n10. Toronto Raptors\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:06:28.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
