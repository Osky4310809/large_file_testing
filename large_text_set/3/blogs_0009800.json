He was squirming and was clearly very distressed. But I knew if I dropped him anywhere short of the lake he’d be close to traffic,” said the resident, who wished to remain anonymous. \n“He got a hold of my finger at one stage and sank his tooth through my nail. I had to go to a GP for a tetanus shot afterwards but I guess it had to be done.” \nThe otter was visibly relieved to find his way back to the water, and swam towards an area of the lake sheltered by reeds. \nOtters are members of the Mustelid family, which includes badgers, stoats, minks, and pine martens. They are nocturnal hunters and it is unusual to see them on land during the day.
