Colin made the role famous (Photo: BBC) \nA host of leading academics have researched how Mr Darcy was likely to really have looked, and you might not like the results. \nMr Darcy was likely to have a long nose, pointed chin, and powered white hair, which is a far cry from what most people have imagined. \nAmanda Vickery, Professor of Early Modern History at Queen Mary University of London, said: \"Mr Darcy is an iconic literary character, renowned for his good looks, charm and mystery. \"As Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in the 1790s, our Mr Darcy portrayal reflects the male physique and common features at the time. We prefer Colin (Photo: BBC) \n\"Men sported powdered hair, had narrow jaws and muscular, defined legs were considered very attractive. \n\"A stark contrast to the chiselled, dark, brooding Colin Firth portrayal we associate the character with today\", which has been \"sexed up\" with a \"turbo-charged injection of testosterone and steamy romance,\" she added. \n\"These illustrations might lead to a slightly different imagining of one of the most famous romantic heroes of all time.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:56:24.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
