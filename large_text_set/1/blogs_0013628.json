If you're teaching adult students, for the best results it's important to understand and practice five principles espoused by Malcolm Knowles, a pioneer in the study of adult learning . He observed that adults learn best when: They understand why something is important to know or do. They have the freedom to learn in their own way. The time is right for them to learn. The process is positive and encouraging. Principle 1: Make Sure Your Adult Students Understand “Why” \nMost adult students are in your classroom because they want to be. Some of them are there because they have Continuing Education requirements to keep a certificate current, but most are there because they’ve chosen to learn something new. \nThis principle is not about why your students are in your classroom, but about why each thing you teach them is an important part of the learning. I’ll use my own pickle-making lesson as an example. \nWhen I learned to make pickles, my teacher and neighbor, Marilyn, helped me understand by including why . It’s important to soak the cucumbers in ice water over night. This helps make the pickles crisp. If you put a towel under the jars in the canner, they won’t bounce against each other and break. When sterilizing the jars, it’s important to fill each at least halfway with water, AND fill the canner they’re sitting in with water. Too little water and the towel mentioned in the previous bullet will catch on fire. You know this kind of information comes from experience. Principle 2: Respect that Your Students Have Different Learning Styles \nThere are three general learning styles : visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. \nVisual learners rely on pictures. They love graphs, diagrams, and illustrations. “Show me,” is their motto. They often sit in the front of the classroom to avoid visual obstructions and to watch you, the teacher. They want to know what the subject looks like. You can best communicate with them by providing handouts, writing on the white board, and using phrases like, “Do you see how this works?” \nAuditory learners listen carefully to all sounds associated with the learning. “Tell me,” is their motto. They will pay close attention to the sound of your voice and all of its subtle messages, and they will actively participate in discussions. You can best communicate with them by speaking clearly, asking questions , and using phrases like, “How does that sound to you?” \nTactile or kinesthetic learners need to physically do something to understand it. Their motto is “Let me do it.” They trust their feelings and emotions about what they’re learning and how you’re teaching it. They want to actually touch what they’re learning. They are the ones who will get up and help you with role playing. You can best communicate with them by involving volunteers, allowing them to practice what they’re learning, and using phrases like, “How do you feel about that?” \nPickle Example: I’m generally a kinesthetic learner . Marilyn talked to me about her pickling process, explaining why she uses the ingredients she does, and showed me how she dips a liquid measuring cup into the hot brine and pours it into the jar using a wide-mouthed funnel, but my greatest learning came when I fumbled through the second jar all by myself. \nMost people use all three styles while they’re learning, and of course, this is logical since we all have five senses, barring any disabilities, but one style almost always is preferred. \nThe big question is, “How do you, as the teacher, know which student has which learning style ?” Without training in neuro-linguistics , it might be difficult, but conducting a short learning style assessment at the beginning of your class would benefit you and the students. This information is as valuable to the student as it is to you. \nThere are several learning style assessments available online, some better than others. I like the one at Ageless Learner . \nShare your thoughts about learning styles. What do you think of the controversy surrounding the idea? Principle 3: Allow Your Students to Experience What They’re Learning \nExperience can take many forms. Any activity that gets your students involved makes the learning experiential . This includes small group discussions, experiments, role playing , skits, building something at their table or desk, writing or drawing something specific – activity of any kind. Activities also keep people energize d, especially activities that involve getting up and moving about. \nThe other aspect of this principle is honoring the life experiences your students bring to the classroom. Be sure to tap into that wealth of wisdom whenever it’s appropriate. You’ll have to be a good timekeeper because people can talk for hours when asked for personal experiences, but the extra facilitation needed will be well worth the gems your students have to share. \nPickle Example: Once Marilyn had shown me how to prepare one jar, she busied herself in the kitchen doing her own thing, close enough to keep an eye on me and to answer my questions, but allowing me the autonomy to go at my own speed. When I made mistakes, she didn’t interfere unless I asked. She gave me the space and the time to correct them on my own.
