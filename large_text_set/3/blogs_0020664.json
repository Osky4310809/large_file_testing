With enough practice, anyone can change, mumbling, mispronunciations, or lightning-speed chatter into a clear, vibrant voice. Steps Learning Basic Enunciation Tips 1 Watch yourself talk in a mirror. Talk at a mirror as you watch the movements of your mouth, jaw, tongue, and lips. Make these movements as big and noticeable as possible. This will improve your enunciation, and help you identify which sounds are difficult for you. Continue to watch yourself in the mirror as you practice the steps below. 2 Show your teeth. Surprisingly, this can help a lot. Showing your teeth gives your lips more space, tightens your cheeks, and creates a larger opening for sound. These changes improve your audibility and intelligibility. And if you don't believe it, try saying \"audibility and intelligibility\" with your lips together, and then with your teeth showing. Aim for a pleasant, happy expression, but not a full-blown smile. Your cheeks shouldn't feel sore after holding a short conversation. 3 Lift up your soft palate. That's the soft part in the back of the roof of your mouth. Singers are trained to raise the soft palate in order to achieve a fuller, more resonant tone. Try inhaling gently as you make a soft k sound, and your soft palate will rise. [1] A small, unvoiced yawn complements the inhale, by warming up different muscles around your soft palate. [2] Avoid exaggerated yawning or gulping to achieve this. Anything more than a gentle effort is counterproductive. 4 Keep the tongue forward and down. Obviously, your tongue will be moving while you speak, but it's still worth practicing a neutral position that doesn't interfere with the passage of sounds. Try hanging your tongue out of your mouth, then gradually pulling it back until it is just behind the lower teeth, touching their base. Your tongue can produce many vowel sounds with minimal movement from this position, mostly by raising and lowering the middle of the tongue instead of the tip. This is especially important while you are singing, or when trying to address certain types of lisp. 5 Stand up straight. This allows you to breathe better. Sound is created by the air being forced out of your lungs, so the clearer your breathing, the clearer your speech. Look straight ahead, so your jaw is flat instead of lowered compressing your throat. When talking to someone roughly the same height as you, maintaining eye contact is a good way to ensure your chin stays raised. 6 Speak slowly and steadily. If you speak quickly, you are much more likely to slur your words. Even if you stutter, the best approach is to pause and attempt the word again, not to rush through it. Part 2 Training Enunciation with Exercises 1 Go through some consonant-vowel combinations. This gets you practice in most common sounds, and is also helpful for \"warming up\" your voice before a speech. Try these common vowels with a few consonants, or even going through the whole alphabet: \"Bah Beh Bee Bih Bo Boo Buh\" \"Vah Veh Vee Vih Vo Voo Vuh\" (et cetera) For more of a challenge, include the vowel \"aw,\" which is similar but distinct from \"ah\" in most dialects. You can also include combination consonants such as \"SL\" and \"PR\" 2 Practice diphthongs. Diphthongs are vowels that require you to move your tongue from one position to another as you pronounce them. Practice saying these words slowly, identifying the two mouth positions you use during the vowel. Then try to speed up and say the words more quickly while keeping your mouth movements precise. Spend more time in the first part of the vowel than the second, and your speech will sound clearer and more refined.
