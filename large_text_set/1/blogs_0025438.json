Offered in two variants – E and V, both are offered with just a single engine option – a 1.5 litre SOHC i-VTEC four-cylinder (120 PS/145 Nm. \nThe seven-seat vehicle retails from RM85,800 (OTR with insurance) for the E variant, and RM92,800 for the V. Built on a stretched version of the Brio platform, the BR-V (or Bold Runabout Vehicle) offers seating for seven people, and those seats can be configured to offer more cargo space as well. \nSeen here is the top-spec V, which comes with all the bells and whistles like additional chrome trim, a 6.1-inch touchscreen display audio system, leather upholstery, as well as a reverse camera. As you’ll see in the video above, the BR-V has plenty going for it. \nFor more information of the Honda BR-V, do check out CarBase.my , along with our review of the seven-seater , where we share our thoughts about it.
