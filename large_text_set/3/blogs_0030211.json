However, the mass resignation letters will give Perez a chance to completely remake the DNC's headquarters from scratch. Staffing had already reached unusual lows following a round of layoffs in December. \n\nImmediately after Perez' election in late February, an adviser to outgoing DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile, Leah Daughtry, asked every employee to submit a letter of resignation dated April 15 , according to multiple sources familiar with the party's internal working. \n\nA committee advising Perez on his transition is now interviewing staff and others as part of a top-to-bottom review process to help decide not only who will stay and who will go, but how the party should be structured in the future. \nBack in late February, Perez appeared on Meet the Press to tell Chuck Todd that he would look to implement a \"culture change\" at the DNC before comparing his own party to a busted plane traveling at 20,000 feet. \nPerez has spent his first weeks on the job in \"active listening mode,\" hearing from Democrats in Washington and in small group meetings across the country before making any big moves. \n\n\"What we're trying to do is culture change,\" he told NBC News between stops of a listening tour in Michigan Friday. \"We're repairing a plane at 20,000 feet. You can't land the plane, shut it down, and close it until further notice.\" \n\n\"If your goal is you have to please everyone then you end up pleasing no one,\" he added. \n\nWe're still awaiting confirmation from Rachel Maddow that this mass firing came after the discovery that the DNC was infiltrated by Russian spies coordinating with the Trump campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:37:45.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
