Getty Images 0 31 Jan 2017 13:35:07 The ex-England international has joked that he could be heading back to the Premier League after getting a call from Eagles manager Sam Allardyce \nRio Ferdinand has not kicked a ball in anger since March 2015, but he seems to think he could still do a job at the very highest level. \n“I’ll see you in the Premier League,” bellowed the former Manchester United defender on transfer deadline day as he joked with his legion of social media followers that a step out of retirement was about to be made. \nThe ex-England international, who is now 38 years of age, suggested that a return to the English top-flight was about to be made at Crystal Palace. \nWATCH: Ferdinand goes wild in United celebration \nThe Eagles have been struggling of late, going eight Premier League games without a win to slip into the relegation zone. \nPerhaps Ferdinand is the answer, but given that the legendary centre-half is currently on his way to Anfield to cover Tuesday’s meeting between Liverpool and Chelsea for BT Sport, that appears unlikely. \n“We’ve been given the call, Big Sam,” said Ferdinand on Twitter. \n“It’s transfer deadline day. I’ve got to get back, boots on. I’ll see you in the Premier League.” I've had the call... U-Turn drives... I'm on my way.. boots in the boot! @premierleague Comeback #DeadlineDay #BigSam pic.twitter.com/KdSyGVukiC — Rio Ferdinand (@rioferdy5) January 31, 2017 \nOnly three sides have conceded more goals than Palace so far this season, which goes some way to explaining why they find themselves in the bottom three. \nThey could do with a defensive leader of Ferdinand’s ilk, but they now have just a matter of hours in which to bring any fresh faces on board before the winter transfer window slams shut.
