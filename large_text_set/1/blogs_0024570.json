In this case, it was the landowner's decision not to provide an official statement,'' Brendan Cox, spokesman with Alberta Justice, said in a statement.\n\"There was no evidence of any other offences.''\nCox says First Nations people with treaty status have a constitutionally protected right to hunt big game for food and are not subject to bag limits. He added the hunters in this case showed officers proof of their treaty status and the landowner granted the hunters access to retrieve the moose.\nAlso on HuffPost:\nClose  Albino Moose Shooting Sparks Outrage of   Full story\nA photo posted to the Hnatiuk's Hunting & Fishing Ltd.
