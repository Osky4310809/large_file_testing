Its missile launch over the Sea of Japan on February 12th came as Donald Trump hosted Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, on a state visit. Mr Abe denounced the launch as “absolutely intolerable”. Mr Trump declared that America “stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%”. China, North Korea’s main ally, condemned the tests but cautioned all sides to “exercise restraint”. At first the missile was thought to be a modified intermediate-range Musudan, which the North has been testing with little success over the past year. It has a range of up to 3,500km—enough to reach American bases in Guam. But on February 13th North Korea claimed it was a “Pukguksong-2”, or Polaris-2, a new medium- to long-range ballistic missile launched from a vehicle using a new delivery system. The North is known for bellicose posturing and grand claims. But South Korean officials have confirmed this is a new surface-to-surface missile that appears to use improved technology from the North’s submarine-launched ballistic-missile system (which has a range of 900km). It employs a solid-fuel system that is quicker for launching than the liquid-fuel system employed in the Musudan. The test is worrying evidence of North Korea’s rapid progress in its aim of developing missile systems with nuclear warheads that can reach the United States. Over the past year it has conducted two nuclear tests and more than 20 missile tests. It already has the technology to make warheads small enough to fit on medium-range Nodong missiles, which can reach Japan and South Korea. The Musudan is the North’s only known intermediate-range missile in development, and tests have so far been unsuccessful. Its KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile is yet to be tested, but Kim Jong Un declared on January 1st that his country was in the final stages of preparations for an intercontinental ballistic missile test-launch. The UN Security Council is set to meet to discuss the latest breach of its resolutions. But rounds of international negotiations and stringent UN sanctions applied last year have so far had little effect on Mr Kim’s nuclear ambitions. Without more pressure from China, North Korea is unlikely to stop.
