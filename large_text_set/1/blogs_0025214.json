Milne quote painted on my kitchen wall — \"If a man really likes potatoes, he must be a pretty decent sort of fellow\" — that basically sums up my feelings on the ingredient. Essentially, if the food is potato-centric, I'm a fan. \nAnd while a basket of fries is the norm for football-watching at bars, sometimes it's fun to tweak things just a bit for home consumption. These breaded, crispy potato bites would be equally at home alongside eggs and bacon on a brunch menu, sidled up next to a sandwich for lunch, or as a counterpoint to a nice fat pork chop and vegetables at dinner. \nBut hey, here they're the perfect snacky bite that you can throw onto a platter with a bowl of gussied-up ketchup and let the guests go wild over them. Barely any effort with a lot of flavorful payoff — that's how I like to roll with my potato game. Crispy Potato Bites with Spicy Ketchup Serves 4 \n1 1/4 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and rinsed Olive or vegetable oil 1/2 cup plain unseasoned breadcrumbs 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup ketchup 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons Sriracha hot sauce 1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise Mexican hot sauce, such as Cholula (optional) \nArrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 450°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. \nCut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces (about 1 to 1 1/2 inches) and toss with a drizzle of olive or vegetable oil. Whisk the breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Add the potatoes and toss until the potatoes are evenly and thoroughly coated in the breadcrumbs. Transfer the potatoes to the baking sheet and spread into a single layer. \nBake for 20 minutes. Flip the potatoes and bake until the breadcrumbs are browned and crisp and the potatoes are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes more. \nWhile the potatoes bake, stir the ketchup, Sriracha, mayonnaise, and a few dashes of hot sauce if using together in a bowl. Serve the potatoes with the spicy ketchup on the side for dipping. Recipe Notes Make ahead: The spicy ketchup can be made and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Storage: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T16:14:50.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
