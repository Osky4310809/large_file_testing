It represents the unravelling of nearly 20 years of unemployment support experience,” one industry insider told the Guardian. \nWork coaches provide long-term unemployed clients with help to acquire a range of employment and life skills designed to increase their chances of finding work, such as CV writing, IT skills and literacy, as well as liaising with potential employers. \nThousands of work coach jobs are expected to be lost. “This means large job losses among really experienced frontline advisers, the majority of which are in charities,” said Kirsty McHugh, the chief executive of the Employment Related Services Association. \nThe work and health programme is expected to start in the autumn and aims to provide specialist support for long-term unemployed people, especially those with health conditions or a disability. \nFunding will be about £100m a year over four year. This is about a quarter of the current annual spending on the work programme, which closes at the end of March, and work choice, which will continue for a few months longer. \nMinisters have been warned that the cuts will undermine the government’s ambitious commitment to half the disability employment gap by 2020, which requires it to find jobs for about 1.2 million disabled or long-term ill people able to work. \nMinisters are understood to believe that rising employment levels, coupled with the provision of extra disability employment advisers in Jobcentre Plus, means that recent high levels of investment in employment support are no longer needed. \nBut the Commons work and pensions committee warned in November that the scale of the cuts to the work and health programme meant that many disabled and ill claimants would be unable to access support. \nTony Wilson, the director of policy and research at the Learning and Work Institute thinktank, said: “The work and health scheme will support far fewer people and it would not be able to deliver services to the extent that could be done previously. \n“Our assessment is that this scheme will make a vanishingly small contribution to the halving of the disability employment gap.” \nOf current work programme contractors, Serco, Maximus, Seetec, Interserve, Learndirect, NCG and Rehab Jobfit are not on the work and health programme provider shortlist. \nThe following firms have made it on to the shortlist, known as the framework: PeoplePlus (shortlisted in all six contract regions), Shaw trust (5), G4s (5), Ingeus (3), Reed (3), Working Links (3), Pluss (2), Prospects (1), APM (1), Remploy (1) and Economic Solutions (1). \nThe regions covered by the framework are: central, north east, north west, southern, home counties and wales. London and Greater Manchester will run their own devolved work and health scheme. \nThe work programme – which was launched in 2011 by the then secretary of state for work and pensions, Iain Duncan Smith – achieved mixed results and was fiercely criticised for the low numbers of disabled and chronically ill people it succeeded in supporting into work. \nIt was also dogged by controversy over alleged misconduct by work coaches, and the high salaries earned by top executives. Emma Harrison, the founder of A4E, was criticised for paying herself dividends of £8.6m in 2011, on top of a £365,000 annual salary. \nHarrison, who had a brief spell as as former prime minister David Cameron’s “families star” sold her personal stake in A4E to Staffline group in 2015 for a reported £20m . The relaunched company, PeoplePlus, is shortlisted in all six work and health programme areas. \nIndustry insiders expressed surprise that Maximus – which has gained notoriety as the provider of the DWPs controversial “fit for work” tests – failed to make the shortlist as it had been seen one of the best performing work programme providers in terms of getting long-term jobless people into sustainable jobs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T16:59:30.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
