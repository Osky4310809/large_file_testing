To be clear, a lot of work is left to be done. Thursday’s frenetic flurry of roster moves, however, was a step in the right direction. \nThe Browns are taking on Brock Osweiler’s unwieldy contract and picking up a 2018 second-round draft pick and a 2017 sixth-round pick for doing so, USA TODAY Sports’ Tom Pelissero confirmed. They are only shipping a fourth-round selection to the Texans in the trade. \nMORE COVERAGE: Even if Redskins' Kirk Cousins is unhappy, don't expect a holdout \nSeem odd for a rebuilding team to take on an unproductive and expensive player? \nThis is exactly what you see in the NBA, when teams are looking to move on from bad contracts and dump the salary elsewhere. Cleveland, essentially, is taking on Osweiler’s $16 million guaranteed salary for this season for the rights to a second-round pick. \nCleveland did not have an immediate plan for Osweiler, but trade talks will be explored before the quarterback is released, a person familiar with the move told Pelissero. The Browns entered Thursday’s start of the new league year with more than $100 million in salary cap space to spend. \nThis isn’t a move for Cleveland to trade for a quarterback. The Browns are betting on themselves to build their roster through the draft. They had the salary cap space to spend. But what they wanted was Houston’s second-round pick. \nCleveland now has seven selections in the first four rounds of each of the next two NFL drafts. \nThat’s great. But the imperative here is that the Browns must hit on the players they select. Because if Cleveland whiffs on its numerous assets and drafts busts, not only will the franchise be set back further, but the jobs of coach Hue Jackson and executive vice president of football operations Sashi Brown could eventually be in peril. \nBut for now, the rebuild is on. And the Browns also did a solid job Thursday of adding pieces that might be difficult to replicate via the draft. \nMORE COVERAGE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:36:58.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
