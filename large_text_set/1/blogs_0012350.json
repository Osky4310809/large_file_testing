President-elect Donald Trump stands with Vice President-elect Mike Pence at a news conference at Trump Tower on January 11, 2017 in New York City. Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images \nDonald Trump held his first press conference as president-elect on Wednesday, despite having been elected more than two months ago. Before today, the last time he held a press conference was July 27, 2015. Since then, Trump took part in three presidential debates, visited Mexico, had his hot-mic Access Hollywood tape aired, was accused of sexual assault several times, and criticized Clinton for going so long without a press conference; his campaign manager was revealed to have had ties to Ukraine, the New York Times found he may have avoided paying taxes for two decades, and the intelligence community concluded that Russia hacked the election to help him win. \nSo when Trump finally held his first formal post-election press conference, the press had plenty to ask him. It was surprising, then, that so many people appeared at the podium who were not Donald J. Trump. Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer, VP-elect Mike Pence, and Trump lawyer Sheri Dillon each took to the dais during the press conference, the latter for an extended period of time.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the 62-minute event: \nTrump: 8 minutes for opening remarks, 29 minutes for answering questions; in total 60 percent of the conference \nSpicer, Pence, and Dillon combined: 20 minutes; 32 percent of the conference \nThe press: 5 minutes; 8 percent of the conference \nMolly Olmstead is a Slate editorial intern.
