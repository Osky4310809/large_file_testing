According to Mundo Deportivo (via Sport Witness ), it is expected that Barca may have to fight off interest for the Brazilian midfielder in the summer transfer windowâ€”although no firm offer has yet been madeâ€”with Liverpool named as key suitors. The report added that Rafinha, 24, is contracted to the Camp Nou to 2020 and has a release clause of â‚¬75 million (Â£64.9 million), a figure no club will likely be willing to match. Having suffered a terrible injury which kept him out for most of the 2015-16 campaign, Rafinha has played a much more prominent role for Barca this season. ALBERTO PIZZOLI/Getty Images He has played a part in 17 of the Blaugrana's 28 La Liga games, netting six goals and providing two assists, per WhoScored.com . While not a guaranteed starter at the Camp Nou, Rafinha is a valuable squad player as he is able to operate both in the central-midfield area and on the right flank. As such, Barca would likely be reluctant to let him go for cheap, and he is reportedly \" very happy where he is,\" per Sport Witness. As a result it seems unlikely that Rafinha will depart in the summer unless Liverpool, or another club, put in a mammoth bid for him that comes close to meeting his release clause. Octavio Passos/Getty Images Meanwhile, Arda Turan's future could still lie at the Camp Nou despite recent reports linking him with a move to Arsenal . The Times ' Matt Hughes revealed previously that the Gunners were lining up a Â£25 million summer bid for the Turkey international to act as a replacement for Mesut Ozil. Bleacher Report's Dean Jones also hinted at a potential move for him to London: Bleacher Report UK @br_uk Where will Arda Turan be playing next season? @DeanJonesBR says a London club would fit should he leave Spain: https://t.co/ACQIyuP955 ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· https://t.co/jG0C08VnVN 3/23/2017, 5:22:31 PM However, Turan's agent, Ahmet Bulut, has denied the link and insisted his client is happy with the Catalan giants, per ESPN FC's Eren Sarigul : \" There is currently no offer, there is nothing to speak of right now. I have not been contacted by Arsenal. As I said before, he is happy at Barcelona and has three years left on his contract.\" Like Rafinha, Turan, 30, is not a guaranteed starter at Barca and could earn more game time at another clubâ€”he has made 17 league appearances this season, netting three goals and providing three assists, per WhoScored.com . Per Sarigul, he was also very much a Luis Enrique signing from Atletico Madrid back in 2015, so Turan's future could be in doubt when the Barca manager leaves at the end of the season. For now, though, it seems Turan's aim is to remain at the Camp Nou to the end of his contract despite the reported interest from Arsenal.
