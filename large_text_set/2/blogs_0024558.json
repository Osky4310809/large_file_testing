Christy Cabrera Chirinos quarterback Brad Kaaya , Miami’s all-time leading passer, is about to get some national exposure ahead of the NFL Draft .\nKaaya, who opted to bypass his senior year and enter the draft, is one of seven quarterbacks that will be featured on ESPN ’s Gruden’s QB Camp . \nThe show, which will begin airing April 11, will also feature former Tennessee quarterback Josh Dobbs , former Notre Dame quarterback DeShone Kizer , former Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes , former Pittsburgh quarterback Nathan Peterman , former North Carolina quarterback Mitch Trubisky and former Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson . \nBoth Watson and Trubisky are projected first-round picks, while projections on Kaaya vary, with some draft experts picking him to be a third-round pick, while others have him going lower.

Excerpts from the show will be featured on several ESPN programs, including SportsCenter and NFL Live. \nKaaya announced shortly after Miami’s win in the Russell Athletic Bowl that he was opting to enter the draft. He leaves as one of the most decorated quarterbacks in Miami history after bypassing Ken Dorsey on Miami’s career passing list. Kaaya, a California native, threw for 9,968 yards and 69 passing touchdowns during his time as a Hurricane. \nOnly Dorsey (86) and Jacory Harris (70) have thrown for more touchdowns at Miami. \nBut Kaaya had his share of struggles too, and took his share of hits this past season, including one against Florida State that cost him a molar. Some of those hits caught Gruden’s attention. \nSo did Kaaya’s accuracy. \n“Kaaya is interesting. The Hurricanes combine the I-formation with the college spread system and he’s an accurate passer,” Gruden said in an ESPN release promoting the QB Camp series. “He got hit a lot this year, but when he has protection, he can throw the football. He relies on timing and he’s going to be a pocket-passer for someone who really wants to accentuate that.” \nAccording to ESPN, 50 quarterbacks — including 15 current NFL starters — have appeared in the series during its seven seasons. Among the quarterbacks to previously appear on the show are Seattle’s Russell Wilson , Indianapolis’ Andrew Luck , Carolina’s Cam Newton , Oakland’s Derek Carr and Dallas’ Dak Prescott. \nNFL prospects train for the upcoming NFL Combine at Pete Bommarito's performance camp in Miami on Tuesday.
