Including a race car AND a backup car. ID: 10615754 8. Inside the hauler everything is organized and labeled meticulously. BuzzFeed\nBuzzFeed\n Everything is just so. It’s a neat-freaks dream come true.\nID: 10616331 9. There’s also an office inside where all the ~speed secrets~ are kept. We’ve very carefully colored over anything that might reveal any speed secrets. Also, saying speed secrets is fun. View this image ›\nID: 10616346 10. Later on we got to meet some of the drivers. This guy, named Aric Almirola ended up coming in fourth place in the race and he designs his own firesuits. Not too shabby. View this image ›\nBuzzFeed ID: 10615171 11. Hot tip: Don’t refer to the firesuit as a “jumpsuit.” We made that mistake with NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Bubba Wallace and he said “I’ve never heard it called that before” and made us feel pretty dumb even though he was very nice about it. View this image ›\nHe also told us that it can get up to 120 degrees inside the car when it’s stopped during a red flag and those firesuits live up to their name. He said he can lose as much as 7 pounds during a race because of the heat.\nID: 10616100 12. This driver, Brennan Poole, told us about his strategy for name-dropping his sponsors during interviews. It’s something NASCAR people take very seriously. View this image ›\nBrennan Poole is sponsored by DC Solar, a clean energy company that specializes in mobile solar products with applications ranging from outdoor lighting to electric vehicle (EV) charging.\nID: 10615755 13. But it’s not just the fact that there is so much shit that goes into race car driving. Raceday itself is just fun as fuck. Before the day even starts the infield of the speedway gets packed with RVs and cars who camp out and basically party nonstop. They have tiki bars. View this image ›\nID: 10615184 14. Firepits and deer heads… View this image ›\nID: 10615097 15. And THESE PEOPLE HAD AN INFLATABLE POOL. It was hawt. View this image ›\nID: 10615091 16. There was even a pop-up coffee shop. It’s like a tiny town inside a stadium. TBH it seemed pretty comfortable and like a nice place to live and raise a family. View this image ›\nID: 10615095 17. By now you might be thinking “OK, but the race can’t be THAT fun.” And you’d be wrong. It can be, AND IT IS. ID: 10615201 18. Literally up until like 15 minutes before the race begins, fans have an opportunity to go walk around certain area of the track. This is us touching that sweet, sweet pavement. BuzzFeed\nBuzzFeed\n ID: 10615057 19. The grass in the middle of the track is also weirdly so, so nice, and everyone was making the same joke that they wished whoever was responsible for it could come over and mow their lawn. View this image ›\nID: 10615734 20. Which is a real shame. Because this is what happened to it at the end of the race. This driver did this crime against grass DELIBERATELY because he was very, very pleased to have won the Great American Race. View this image ›\nChris Graythen / Getty Images ID: 10616223 21. Not only did we get to casually hang on the speedway, but upon closer inspection, we realized there were hidden messages all over the track. View this image ›\nID: 10615737 22. We weren’t sure if this was actually allowed or not, but it seemed like a thing so we found someone to stealthily hand over their sharpie and we left our marks on the track. BuzzFeed\nBuzzFeed\n Everyone at NASCAR races is super friendly and there is a team spirit amongst the spectators, so we gave our clandestine sharpie to another track-vandalizing ne’er-do-well as soon as we had finished our graffiti crimes.\nID: 10615089 23. And then…right before heading to the field, we witnessed something spectacular. A couple was getting married at the start/finish line RIGHT BEFORE OUR VERY EYES. View this image ›\nID: 10615214 24. Their names are Ian and Jodi. They both love NASCAR and sealed their vows by signing the track. Ian said that the start and finish line of the track was symbolic of the finish of their old lives and the start of their new ones. It was truly lovely.\nID: 10616157 25. Now that we believed in love again, we headed towards the field to watch the driver introductions. ID: 10615220 26. Along the way we saw these dudes reppin’ America. View this image ›\nBuzzFeed ID: 10615059 27. These people wearing cowboy hats made of beer cans: View this image ›\nID: 10615100 28. And a gaggle of overall wearing men with mullets. It is hard to describe the emotional feeling you get when you see a gaggle of mullet-men like this, except to say that it is a warm feeling that fills you up and makes you feel safe. View this image ›\nID: 10615025 29. And on the NASCAR version of the Hollywood Walk Of Fame, we learned that Jack’s hands and feet size are pretty much identical to Dale Earnhardt Jr.’s. NEAT! ID: 10616364 30. We got to meet vegan racecar driver Leilani Münter, who literally races to save animals. View this image ›\nShe was handing out fake meats to people who had never tasted them and they were a crazy big hit with the crowd.\nID: 10615784 31. After touring the track, we went to Pit Road. It’s where we got to watch the race from, and yes we realize that we are very lucky and this is an insane thing. View this image ›\nID: 10615103 32. Because we were pretty much a part of the pit crew. Except for the fact that if we touched anything or came too close they’d probably hate us forever. View this image ›\nID: 10615119 33. The coolest thing was getting to watch a car make a pit stop up close. The crew gets ready and puts their marker out so that the car knows when to stop. View this image ›\nID: 10615116 34. You can design your own marker and this was one of them. It was for the driver Kevin Harvick. Allegedly it’s a smiley face because he’s always grumpy, so his pit crew nicknamed him “Happy.” View this image ›\nBuzzFeed ID: 10615107 35. Later on in the race Kevin Harvick got involved in this insane wreck (his car is the one with the 4 on the roof), which may explain why he’s always such a debbie downer. View this image ›\nChris Graythen / Getty Images ID: 10616174 36. But anyway, back to the pit stop. The car comes and goes so fast it’s like it’s happening in fast forward. Not even kidding when we say this gif is probably the exact same amount of time as the actual pit stop. IT’S INSANE. View this image ›\nID: 10615122 37. They literally have to change tires and pump the car full of gas in like 10 seconds. We were sweating for them. View this image ›\nIn a normal pit stop, they’ll fill up the tank with gas, change all four tires, and sometimes make other adjustments to the car. An average pit stop takes about 13 seconds total.\nID: 10615297 38. After hanging by the Pit Road for a bit we left to watch the race elsewhere. Now we were invested. The speed got to us. Watching the cars go around the track was addicting. View this image ›\nBuzzFeed ID: 10615716 39. Even though the race is 200 laps and goes on for hours, it was flying by. One minute they were on the third lap, the next minute it was lap 80. View this image ›\nBuzzFeed ID: 10616377 40. And then things actually got … really interesting, racewise? The guy at the front of that pileup is Kyle Busch, who we made the cool ~insidery~ joke about being a sore loser earlier. He blamed the crash on Goodyear making shitty tires. View this image ›\nJerry Markland / Getty Images ID: 10616384 41. Right after that crash happened and they’d cleared the track up, this happened. It is INSANE to watch something like this happen up close. The Big One in turn 3 at #Daytona500 Jimmie Johnson, Kevin Harvick, Denny Hamlin, Danica Patrick, & more involved.\n— XFINITY Racing (@XFINITYRacing) ID: 10620222 42. The race came right down to the wire, when a bunch of dudes ran out of gas at the last minute and Kurt Busch made a crazy move to take the lead on the last lap. Our hearts were in our throats. View this image ›\nJared C. Tilton / Getty Images ID: 10620303 43. Anyway, in conclusion, NASCAR is SO MUCH FUN and we didn’t get it before but now we do. View this image ›\nID: 10621693 44. And that’s how you go from not caring to being a big ol’ ~NASCAR head~ in the course of one weekend. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ID: 10620433 ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/835974912544227333"], "published": "2017-03-02T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:55:44.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
