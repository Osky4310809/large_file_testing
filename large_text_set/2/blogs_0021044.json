Lamb hit a cutter right down the middle that I wanted to cut and it didn’t cut.” \nBlack agreed with Anderson’s assessment: “I just think he was amped up. I think that was good self-evaluation by Tyler.” \nHits: Ian Desmond impressed in his Rockies debut, going 3-for-3 with an RBI and a stolen base. He also looked comfortable playing his first game at first base. … Shortstop Trevor Story, who hit 27 homers in 97 games last season, led off the fourth with a first-pitch, solo homer off Archie Bradley. … Six Colorado pitchers, led by right-hander Antonio Senzatela’s two scoreless innings, held the Diamondbacks scoreless from innings two through eight. … Gerardo Parra, who started in left field in front of rookie David Dahl, hauled in a rising line drive by Arizona slugger Paul Goldschmidt in the second inning, saving two runs. \nMisses: Backup first baseman Mark Reynolds, in camp on a minor-league deal, went 0-for-3 with three strikeouts and left four baserunners stranded. \nUp next: The Rockies have an early spring split-squad doubleheader, hosting Arizona at Salt River Fields and also traveling to Glendale to meet the Chicago White Sox. \nPitching probables vs. Arizona, 1:10 p.m., at Salt River Fields \nRockies: RHP Yency Almonte, RHP Yency Almonte, RHP Zach Jemiola, RHP Jason Motte, LHP Mike Dunn, RHP Chad Qualls \nDiamondbacks: RHP Kevin Jepsen, RHP Tom Wilhelmsen, RHP Randall Delgado, RHP Enrique Burgos, RHP Evan Marshall, LHP Jared Miller, RHP Jimmie Sherfy \nPitching probables at Chicago White Sox, 1:05 p.m., at Camelback Ranch \nRockies: RHP German Marquez, LHP Harrison Musgrave, RHP Carlos Estévez, RHP Matt Carasiti, RHP Shane Carle, RHP Rayan González, RHP C.C.
