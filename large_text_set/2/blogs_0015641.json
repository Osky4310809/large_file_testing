\nINIESTA AGREES VERRATTI IS HIS ‘HEIR’ \nParis Saint-Germain completely outplayed Barcelona in the 4-0 Champions League win last week as the likes of Marco Verratti, Angel Di Maria, Edinson Cavani, Julian Draxler and Adrien Rabiot ran riot. \nBut during the match Andres Iniesta, 32, also confirmed one of those PSG stars could become his successor. \nWhen Italian midfielder Verratti, 24, was down injured on the pitch, Blaise Matuidi had an interesting conversation with Iniesta. \nMatuidi revealed to French radio station France Bleu , “When Verratti was on the ground after getting injured, I told Iniesta that he is his heir. \n“And he replied, ‘Yes, I think so too.’” \nIniesta, who has been one of the world’s best midfielders for the past decade, had only recently returned from injury, but Verratti consistently got the better of him during the match. \nVerratti was linked with a move to Chelsea last year and is valued at $110 million according to Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport.

He knows, everyone knows,” Guardiola told reporters on Monday. Pep Guardiola and Sergio Aguero. Source: Getty Images \n“We are going to talk with him like with all of his teammates. In this level it is so demanding in the Champions League. \n“It is one of the most beautiful competitions to play, maybe not the most important, but the most beautiful and we have to do our best. \n“All of Europe will watch us, to analyse us, to kill us if we don’t win or say how good we are if we do win. That is the huge experience. It is beautiful to me.” And Guardiola has faith in Aguero to rediscover his goalscoring touch. “The guys who score goals, it is talent, instinct. How they have to move, create spaces. He does not need to be controlled like a TV remote control. He is going to do it himself.” 'Mooy is playing amazing' 0:44 \nCOUTINHO FAILS TRYING TO REPLICATE LEGENDARY GERRARD GOAL \nSteven Gerrard’s late goal against Olympiakos in the Champions League in 2004 remains one of Anfield’s best ever moments. \nIt’s the strike that sent Liverpool through the group stages before they claimed the trophy after coming back from 3-0 down against AC Milan. \nNow current Reds star Philippe Coutinho has attempted to replicate his strike - but it didn’t goal very well.
