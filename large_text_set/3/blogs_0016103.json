Here’s why.\nAdvertisement \n\nLet me begin by saying that I thank the heavens everyday that Michigan doesn’t have a safety inspection, otherwise my Beloved But Totally Junky 1948 Willys CJ-2A (which I’m currently repairing ) would be in a junkyard. Or the EPA’s equivalent of a CIA black site, tucked away where it can never do harm to anyone. \nStill, if I set my personal preferences aside, I think a really basic safety inspection—consisting of only a couple of checks!—should be a requirement across America. It’s the right thing to do.\nYour Average Person Ignores Serious Problems \nAll too often, I get calls from my friends about a “shimmy” they’ve been feeling in their steering wheel for the past six months. “It’s really not that bad, plus the shop wants way too much to fix it,” they tell me as I sit their wide-eyed, fearing for their life.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nIt’s people like these—who aren’t experienced with a wrench (i.e. most people)—who have brought me to a conclusion that we need safety inspections; these folks just don’t understand the potential ramifications of a little “shimmy” in the steering, or even brakes that are a bit “spongy.”\nAnd the potential consequences are devastating. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen cars on the side of the road with one wheel ripped off the knuckle and folded underneath the vehicle. That’s because that little wobble in the steering wheel turned out to be a bad ball joint—that’s the part that holds the wheel onto the car.\nJust look at the picture above of the ball joint I took out of my old Honda Accord. The previous owner had just ignored it, and I found myself driving on the highway with a wobble in my steering. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:45:17.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
