Kennedy at the luncheon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, which was when he extended an invitation for her to visit. \nNBC News reported that while it was common for Supreme Court justices to invite guests for arguments, it was rare to see presidential children in the audience. \nThe two sat in the VIP section, for obvious reasons.   \nTrump posted to social media about the event and said, “Arabella and I visited the Supreme Court this morning and attended a hearing. I’m grateful for the opportunity to teach her about the judicial system in our country firsthand.” Arabella & me at the Supreme Court today. I'm grateful for the opportunity to teach her about the judicial system in our country firsthand. pic.twitter.com/1YXHyZ9ADZ \n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 22, 2017 \nIt just goes to show you’re never too young to learn about the Constitution. \nEarlier in the month, Trump also took her daughter to the Chinese embassy in Washington to take part in the Lunar New Year festivities.
