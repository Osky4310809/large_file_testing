But Arsenal and Manchester United, five and six points behind them respectively, both have two games in hand and the Reds will know they will be hard on their tails for the rest of the season. \nChelsea and Manchester City are certs to be in the final top four, meaning it’s two from four – with third-placed ­Tottenham also included – for the remaining spots. \nSo, from a position of real strength at the turn of the year, my old club now find themselves in a dogfight. Klopp roars orders as Liverpool battle past Burnley 2-1 on Sunday (Photo: Reuters) \nWhat surprises me is that every time Liverpool lose a few games it’s their owners, FSG, who get the rollocking from fans. \nBut FSG didn’t make the decision to play James Milner at left-back, FSG didn’t make the decision to play Lucas Leiva at centre-half and FSG didn’t make the decision to let Mamadou Sakho , the club’s best in-box defender, go when they still needed him. \nThat was down to Klopp, because his pride was more important than putting an arm round Sakho’s shoulder and telling him he was the best thing since sliced bread. Liverpool have been using midfielder Lucas in central defence... (Photo: Reuters) ...yet loaned out Sakho, their best centre-back, to Crystal Palace... (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) ...while Milner, another midfielder, has been a makeshift left-back all season (Photo: Getty) \nHe should have used him until the end of the season and then biffed him off. \nThat would have been the clever thing to do, but Klopp knew better. \nAnd in booting him out of the club, he basically left himself with a back four that's almost unfit for purpose. \nWatch — Sakho's attempt to troll Klopp on pre-season tour backfires in the WORST way: Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T21:09:10.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
