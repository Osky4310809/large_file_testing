Jan 23, 2017 | 04:56 Gasol leads Grizzlies past Raptors, 101-99 Posted: Jan 25, 2017 \nMarc Gasol scored a career-high 42 points, and the Memphis Grizzlies finished the three-game home stand with a 101-99 win over the Toronto Raptors Wednesday at FedExForum. The squads split the season series 1-1. Memphis’ win snapped a three-game losing streak against Toronto. \nIn Memphis’ final game before All-Star reserves are announced, Gasol topped his previous career high of 38 points, accomplished twice before, last on Dec. 21 at Detroit. He became the first Grizzlies player since Rudy Gay (43, Dec. 13, 2009 at Miami) with a 40-point game and the first to do it at home since his brother, Pau Gasol (44, March 28, 2006 vs. Seattle). It’s the 10th 40-point performance in franchise history and the most for a Grizzlies player since Pau scored 43 at Golden State on Jan. 11, 2008. \nGasol scored the Grizzlies’ first 16 points over the opening 3:21 of the contest, making 14-of-25 from the field, 5-of-10 from three-point range and 9-of-10 from the free throw line by the end of the night. He has scored 28-or-more points in four straight games and has scored 154 points over the last five (30.8 points), marking his career-high over any five-game stretch. Gasol has also now scored 30-or-more points in consecutive games for the second time in his career (Nov. 21-23, 2014). His 23 first-half points tied a season-high for a Grizzlies player (Troy Daniels, Dec. 3 vs. LAL). His five three-pointers marked a career-high. \nBoth teams started the game on an offensive tear, shooting a combined 25-of-41 (.610) from the field (Grizzlies: 12-19, .632; Raptors: 13-22, .591) and scoring 66 points in the first quarter. It was a Grizzlies season-high for first quarter field goal percentage. \nThe game was tight throughout before the Grizzlies went on a 9-2 run to finish the third quarter with a 10-point lead (87-77). The Raptors clawed their way back in it, eventually tying the game with 1:31 remaining. Gasol, however, hit two go-ahead free throws with 36.3 seconds left before Kyle Lowry’s three-pointer missed as time expired. \nZach Randolph (17,242 points), who finished with 16 points and eight rebounds, made his second start of the season for Memphis and passed Jeff Malone (17,231) for 86th in NBA history for career points scored. Tonight marked the first game since Feb. 8, 2016 that he and Gasol were in the starting lineup together. \nTony Allen (15 points, 11 rebounds) recorded his fifth double-double of the season and Mike Conley (11 points) also scored in double figures. \nKyle Lowry led the Raptors with 29 points on 11-of-21 shooting. Norman Powell scored 12 of his season-high-tying 21 points in the first quarter. \nThe Grizzlies are now 9-2 when playing an opponent that is on the second night of a back-to-back. Next Game \nThe Grizzlies begin a season-long six-game road trip when they take on the Portland Trail Blazers Friday, Jan. 27 at 9 p.m. CT at Moda Center.

Gasol’s career-high 42 points, on a career-high 5-of-10 (.500) from three-point range, was the 10th 40-point performance in Grizzlies history and are the most by a Grizzlies player since Pau Gasol scored 43 on Jan. 11, 2008 at Golden State… The last time a Grizzlies player scored 40-or-more points in any game was when Rudy Gay totaled 41 on Dec. 13, 2009 at Miami, and the last time a Grizzlies player scored at least 40 at home was on March 28, 2006 when Pau Gasol posted 44 points.

Joe Murphy/NBAE via Getty Images Loading recommendations Team Quotes On Marc Gasol having a career high 42 points I think we all saw it right from the beginning. He had a golden mind tonight that he was not going to go down watching. This is why I’ve been pushing him. I’ve really just pushed him to get out of his comfort zone and look to get aggressive about scoring the ball. He is really embracing that role for us, because it’s not his nature. He is an unselfish guy by nature. My psychology is, ‘You’re being selfish by not being selfish.’ I was really happy with him, obviously, and happy for him for continuing to shatter previous career highs and things like that. Like I said, my fingers are crossed for him. I really want him to play in that [All-Star] game in February. -- Coach Fizdale On Vince Carter’s 360 layup in the first half I’m telling you guys, I know you’re not going to believe me but you can ask J.B. Bickerstaff if I’m lying. I predicted this. Tony Allen tried a 360 in our first game against Toronto and I said, ‘Wait a minute. If anyone is going to be doing 360s on this team, it’s going to be Vince.’ I said that today, I promise you, and I looked at J.B. Bickerstaff and we both just started laughing. I thought that’s just got to be a good sign for this one, my 40 year-old is out here 360ing. It’s just awesome to watch. He’s out here doing what he’s doing and I think he’s got a lot of other 40-year-old fans out there that he’s doing it for. A lot of guys out there which they had those knees that can get him up in the air and do what Vince is doing. Like I said, he’s invaluable to us. He played 30 minutes tonight and he’s 40 years old. It’s awesome to see it and it’s awesome to be a part of his journey, the journey of a future Hall of Famer and I’m just enjoying it. -- Coach Fizdale On the upcoming six-game road trip I love it. This is great. It’s not difficulty to me. Every road trip we seem to get a little closer and a little more connected. Here we go again. It’s a six-game trip with all good teams, all well-coached teams, but we are going to go after them one at a time. I think the road has a way of bonding you and connecting you because that’s all you got out there. Hopefully we can take another step forward this road trip. -- Coach Fizdale Watch Coach Fizdale’s Post-Game Press Conference On Coach Fizdale’s remarks about needing to be more selfish with the ball I think I made plays when I was supposed to. I was aggressive. When I caught it and I had a shot, I drove it and tried to make plays for someone else. I even brought it up a couple of times. So, I guess, that‘s what we need and that’s what I’m going to try to do every game. Obviously it’s going to require a different mindset but I think the last few games I’ve been trying to do that a little bit more. I’m going to keep doing it. -- Marc Gasol I’m always going to be proud to represent the city, the franchise, and the people that have always supported me and believed in me. Obviously, after an injury like last year, people had reason to be a little down. If that’s the case, I will be representing them too. But, I really hope that little fellow [Conley] over there makes it. -- Marc Gasol On tonight’s win before hitting the road It felt really good. Not only to get a win, but to win against a very good team. To play the defense that we did for four quarters is what we wanted to accomplish tonight. When going on a road trip where you know each game is going to get tougher as you go, to get a win going out there is great. -- Mike Conley On Marc’s performance It’s great. It’s so fun to watch and to be a part of. Tonight was something special and it got to the point where everyone was just trying to get him the ball no matter where we were on the court. That’s what is fun, to be a part of a team that cares like that. We know it’s not about one individual guy, but if a guy’s got it going and having a great night like tonight – I mean you saw how excited we all were for him. It was a great night to be his teammate. -- Mike Conley Player Notes Gasol is the fourth center with a 40-point game in the league this season ( DeMarcus Cousins , Anthony Davis , Karl-Anthony Towns ). Zach Randolph (17,242) passed Jeff Malone (17.231) for 86th in NBA history for career points scored. Randolph finished in double figures with 16 points and eight rebounds in 38 minutes. Tony Allen recorded a double-double with 15 points and a team-high 11 rebounds in 35 minutes. Mike Conley posted 11 points and a team-high five assists in 36 minutes. Leading the Raptors with 29 points, Kyle Lowry has posted 15 or more points in the past five games. Lowry also recorded a game-high eight assists in 39 minutes. Norman Powell tied a season-high 21 points in 33 minutes (previous: Dec. 20, 2016 vs. Brooklyn). This is the second straight game Powell has scored in double figures. Jonas Valanciunas grabbed a game-high 12 boards and has grabbed 10-or-more rebounds in five of the Raptors’ last six games.
