Sure, there is no rent, no work, and people tend to feed you mac and cheese pretty often, but things aren’t easy. Like preschool. That place can be tough. Especially if you’re Reese Witherspoon’s son, who can’t spell his own name . To add insult to injury, his mom thinks it’s absolutely hysterical, even though it’s basically her fault. Moms, amiright?\nWitherspoon posted a picture of her son at school to Instagram where ehe’s holding a piece of paper with some green markings.\n“When your name is TENNESSEE , it’s a bit tricky to learn how to spell it,” she wrote. #PRESCHOOLPROBLEMS\nOh, that poor thing. Tennessee James is 4 years old and Witherspoon’s youngest (and only) kid with her husband Jim Toth. She has two other kids, Ava and Deacon , with ex Ryan Phillippe. Check it out: Tennessee got the longest and most complicated name, easy. He might never learn how to spell his name . Honestly, we’ve had to use spell check three times already because it’s impossible for us to remember if it’s two Ns or not. Sort of like every time we have to type “Mississippi” we sing a little song in our heads.\nYup, we did it just there, too.\nWhen your name is TENNESSEE, it's a bit tricky to learn how to spell it ... #PreSchoolProblems \nA post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Mar 21, 2017 at 10:14am PDT \nWe can’t tell if he’s on this joke either, and we sort of hope he isn’t. Does that make us cruel? \nHe’ll obviously get over it, and he has the coolest family ever. Witherspoon shared a picture last year of his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle s-themed birthday party where her husband and kids, Ava and Deacon, writing, “Celebrating our sweet Tennessee’s 4th birthday last night! My forever favorite #NinjaTurtle.” With older siblings like Deacon and Ava , he’s bound to be cool one day.\nCelebrating our sweet Tennessee’s 4th birthday last night! My forever favorite #NinjaTurtle #TMNT #FamilySandwich \nA post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Sep 27, 2016 at 11:49am PDT \nHis sister, Ava, who looks just like her mom at 17 years old, is totally enamored with the toddler, too. His big sister wished him well on his big day, writing”happy early birthday to this super preschooler going on teenager. I love you, dude.” Tennessee is looking right in to the camera sipping a juice box.\nThe look in his eyes just screams, “Please teach me how to spell.”\nhappy early birthday to this super preschooler going on teenager. I love you, dude. \nA post shared by Ava Phillippe (@avaphillippe) on Sep 25, 2016 at 6:49pm PDT \nNever change, kid.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:34:45.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
