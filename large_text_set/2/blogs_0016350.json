which is used to uncertainty - is really willing to embrace right now,\" Ernsberger explained. \n\"So there's a stability of new supply issue that really needs to get worked out in the next few years,\" he added, saying this was the \"big story\" regarding shale right now. show chapters 1 Hour Ago | 02:51 \nAnother prominent concern in the market is the distribution of derivative positioning with record net long positions and a current long to short positioning ratio of around 10:1, with this being a key reason why oil will soon drop to below $50 per barrel, Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commodity Research at Commerzbank, told CNBC's Street Signs on Tuesday. \nWeinberg also argued that the focus on OPEC compliance levels were like a distracting \"magician's show\" while the real action is taking place in the U.S., which he claims is on the way to regaining its crown as the world's largest oil producer. \n\"OPEC must at some point recognize and understand that they are no more the marginal producers and marginal production will be coming from shale oil so prices will come under massive pressure during this year once investors recognize oil supplies are not going to disappear,\" he opined. \n\"The world is awash with oil at the moment and there continues to be endless supply so therefore I don't see a real reason for prices to rise above $60 or $70â€¦so I'm really seeing probably the risks of the prices falling below $50 for a considerable period of time and probably even touching the levels of $40 to $45 this year,\" he concluded. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:00:44.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
