Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images \nPresident Trump’s view of the media is well-documented . Advancing his administration's explicit strategy of treating the press like the opposition party , Trump said during Thursday’s press conference , “I haven’t seen more dishonest media than the political media.” But this time, Trump went beyond merely bashing the Fourth Estate writ large: He offered his criticisms outlet by outlet, reporter by reporter. \nWhat did the media critic in chief sound like?

You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings, but the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth. The hatred coming from other people on your network. Now, I will say this, I watch it. I see it. I am amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around and start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. I think you would do much better by being different. Tomorrow the headlines are going to be, “Donald Trump rants and raves.” I'm not ranting and raving. \nIn response to hearing BBC reporter Jon Sopel's British accent: Trump : Where are you from? Reporter : The BBC. Trump : Here’s another beauty. Reporter : It’s a good line. Impartial, free and fair. Trump : Yeah, sure. Just like CNN. Right.

Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. \nAfter the reporter asked a question about how the government would address anti-semitism: He said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not. It's not. Not a simple question, not a fair question. OK, sit down.

That is very nice. Who are you with? Reporter : UNF News . It’s an independent— Trump : Then I’m going to start watching. \nAfter calling on April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks: Trump : This is going to be a bad question. But that’s OK. Reporter : No, it’s not going to be a bad question. Trump : Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. \nAfter Ryan asked about Trump’s plan for “inner cities” and his executive order on historically black colleges and universities to be signed in the afternoon: Trump : That was very professional and very good. Reporter : I’m very professional. \nTrump also paused to compliment his current favorite morning show: Fox and Friends in the morning, they are very honorable people. Not because they are good. Because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. \nMolly Olmstead is a Slate editorial intern.
