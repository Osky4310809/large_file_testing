Sure, but considering how often I zip through bottles of the stuff—I spritz it on multiple times a day with zero shame—and how eager I am to expand my stock, it feels like a solid comparison. And one of my top go-tos is an old classic among beauty editors and makeup artists alike: Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs, and Rosewater. But I soon might be changing my tune because the skin-care brand just dropped a new version of its fan-favorite face mist, called the Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Cucumber, and Green Tea, and it's good . Just as the name suggests, the Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Cucumber, and Green Tea is made with a blend of antioxidant-spiked ingredients to help soothe skin during the dreaded 3 p.m. slump. (Or, like whenever you want to use it because that's when I've been turning to mine lately.) There are hydrating heavy hitters like aloe vera-leaf juice and cucumber that lock in skin's moisture; green tea extract, which acts as an anti-inflammatory to calm redness; and peppermint-leaf water, which has been known to help reduce sebum production (a.k.a. control oily skin). Based on the ingredient list alone I'm sold hook, line, and sinker. Case in point: Peppermint-leaf water is the third (!) ingredient, followed by cucumber-fruit water and aloe-leaf juice. So many times ingredients splashed on a product's label are hidden in the deep cuts of the ingredient list. This elixir is pure, natural, and loaded with real-deal botanicals.
