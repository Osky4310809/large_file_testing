She highlighted that it it doesn’t just rest with the ones that have to go through Senate confirmation, either, bringing up Monica Crowley’s plagiarism scandal. \n“They have only named two people under the National Security Adviser so far,” she noted. “They’ve only named two people and one of them had to withdraw, had to lose the job because of the the multiple substantial plagiarism allegations against her, some of which had been known and publicly reported for years.” \nMaddow then turned to how important it is to have your national security council in place on day one, explaining that there is a potential regional war that could set off in Africa very soon, stating that the Obama team is only in place for one more day. \n“On the very, very basic stuff,” she concluded. “On staffing up. On preparing nominees, on getting people in place even in key national security positions if nowhere else the new administration didn’t get it done. And time is now up.” \nWatch the clip above, via MSNBC. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T07:34:26.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
