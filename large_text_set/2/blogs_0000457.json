King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 10 hours ago 17 \nPhil Anselmo took a jab at the \"antisocial\" social media, singling out comment sections as one of its worst sides. \nPantera singer tells Metal Wani : \"Shit, I can't even go to my local newspaper without seeing some bullshit divisive bullshit article written with the blurring of linear time. \n\"It's like, 'Man, no, I'm not buying into this. 'Cause, really, I just clicked on to this page to find out what the fucking New Orleans Saints are doing.' It's like, 'Fuck! I don't need to read all this fucking shit, man. Just tell me who the fucking Saints are gonna sign.' \n\"It's not that I'm against social media - there are imperfections, like with anything. Life is one giant imperfection, but still we deal and we cope. And I deal and cope with social fucking media, which is truly antisocial media.\" \nFocusing on the comments section, the musician added: \"It'd be one thing if they could put out their divisive articles, but it's a whole another thing to put in a comments section. \n\"No matter what line of work you may be in - you could be writing about social climate of America in general, you could write about music, you could write about boxing, you could write about football - with the comments section, everybody's an expert, everybody's a mind reader, everybody knows better than you do. \n\"And I'm calling bullshit. I'm calling absolute bullshit on that. I am.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:52:51.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
