So she ditched her club, where she had reached the highly skilled Level 10, and joined the high school team. “I wanted to have more fun and see what team gymnastics was like,” Lenarz said. “It’s been so much more than I thought it would be.” Not only is Lenarz having a blast, she’s been performing at a very high level. She posted a 38.3 all-around score on Saturday to win the Mahtomedi Invitational, highlighted by a school record 9.75 mark in the vault. That broke the school record set by Mahtomedi legend Mindy Myhre more than 20 years ago. “You see her name up on the wall in everywhere,” Lenarz said. “I can’t believe I broke her record. It’s such an honor.” And most importantly, Lenarz has thoroughly enjoyed senior year so far. “I love football and I got to go to every football game this year,” she said. “And I’ve gone to all the basketball games. I’d never gone before because I was practicing and now I love basketball. Who knew?” LUCY BURTON Blake • hockey The senior forward posted back-to-back four-point games, scoring two goals and two assists each in victories over rival Breck 4-2 and Bloomington Kennedy 7-0. Burton, who will play at Yale next year, has scored eight goals in her last four games. GRACE HEITING East Ridge • hockey The Raptors have won five consecutive games and are within one game of the Suburban East Conference lead. Heiting, a junior forward, provided the offensive spark last week with six goals and three assists in victories over Woodbury, Mounds View and Stillwater. GOANAR MAR DeLaSalle • basketball Islanders coach DaveThorson said the 6-7 senior forward is having “a remarkable season.” Last week he had 25 points and seven rebounds in a 98-64 victory over St. Anthony, and 21 points and 20 rebounds in a 71-55 victory at Columbia Heights. DEV MCCABE St. Paul Academy • hockey The junior forward had one of those weeks where everything went right. He had his first hat trick of the season and added an assist in a 10-1 rout of Bloomington Kennedy. He also had two goals and four assists in a 8-1 victory over Blake. RACHEL STEINER Lakeville North • gymnastics The freshman won the all-around competition at the 37th Annual Lakeville Invitational, posting a season-best 38.45. Detroit Lakes, the No. 1 team in Class 1A, won the meet with a team score of 151.6. Lakeville North was second with a 149.7. KURTIS WEIGAND Blaine • basketball The 6-5 senior forward paced the Bengals to three victories, setting up a huge home game Friday against Class 4A, No. 1 Champlin Park for first place in the Northwest Suburban Conference. Weigand had a combined 51 points and 42 rebounds in victories over Elk River, Coon Rapids and Duluth East. JIM PAULSEN Nominate an athlete: Send an e-mail with supporting information to .
