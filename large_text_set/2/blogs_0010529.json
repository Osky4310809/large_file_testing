Because the supermodel knows how to let loose. Advertising \nBut one thing she couldn't let loose after the awards show was her jewelry. Because she was too drunk—a problem that most women who have hit the bottle a little too hard can relate to. \nLucky for her, she has a husband who is not only mega-famous and a babe, but super-nice and helpful (and seemingly sober) in times of trouble. John Legend came to her rescue and lucky for us , she Snapchatted the whole thing: \nMY HEART. This is honestly goals. http://bzfd.it/2l7Y9Mm Posted by BuzzFeed Style on Monday, February 13, 2017 \nThis is #relationshipgoals, for sure. Because who doesn't want to get wasted at an awards show and then have their hot, doting husband help them take their jewelry off?? Most of us just end up sleeping with it on and wake up with weird marks on our neck and face. Advertising \nThis isn't to say Teigen isn't feeling the consequences of her night. It seems her morning was pretty rough. I don't feel good — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 13, 2017 \nBut she brushed it off. How am I feeling, you ask pic.twitter.com/OTeuWy041B — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 13, 2017 \nAnd did some reminiscing about last night. This is when it all went downhill for me https://t.co/j4sHGWFdGc — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 13, 2017 I yelled \"welcome to dorit's buddha lounge\" at anyone who entered the green room — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 13, 2017 \nShe seems to have made quite the impression on at least this guy: @chrissyteigen I don't know if you remember but last night at the party you burped on me as you said goodbye and I was honestly thrilled — Brennan Carley (@BrennanCarley) February 13, 2017 Advertising — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 13, 2017 \nChrissy, I hope your hangover has subsided.
