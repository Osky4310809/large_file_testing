From where we see it, it means having an entire day dedicated to loving, and pampering yourself without any guilt whatsoever! If you're your own Valentine, that is actually a pretty awesome thing. Mostly because it involves you buying yourself a present (or few), that you know you will love! If you need help trying to figure out what to get yourself this V-Day, here's a list: 1. Wall art that you will cherish for the rest of your life 2. Spa day. Because you know you deserve it! 3. A ring for that finger. Because why should you wait? 4. A bottle of that perfume, which can be smelled from a mile away 5. A subscription box of your favourite thing. A year-long supply of make-up? Yes, please! 6. A makeover 7. A comfortable chair or couch that's ONLY for you to use! 8. A gym or fitness centre membership. Because keeping healthy is the best thing you can do for yourself.
