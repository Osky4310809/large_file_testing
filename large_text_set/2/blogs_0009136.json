Lee Zeldin can't stand the heat in NY-01 District's kitchen “You can’t complain if you’re not willing to fight for change.” — Rep. Lee Zeldin (NY-01) \nThose are the words of Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin in his featured campaign ad of the 2016 election season. But, it appears Rep. Zeldin feels differently now that he finds himself under scrutiny from angry constituents who’ve been trying to meet with him. In fact, he’s so unwilling to meet with the people of his district who are “fighting for change” that he has preemptively cancelled a constituent town hall event in April ! \nFrom the \"I shit you not\" files: \nU.S. Representative Lee Zeldin, who was reelected to represent the 1st Congressional District in November, has canceled an upcoming event for constituents at the Rogers Memorial Library in Southampton Village following reports that local organizations planned to hold a protest rally at the event. According to Mr. Zeldin’s communications director, Jennifer DiSiena, the April 18 event was canceled due to concerns about anticipated harassment by groups that had rallied at a recent event in East Patchogue, where Mr. Zeldin was honored as Man of the Year by the Rotary Club of Shirley and the Mastics. Regarding the upcoming library event in Southampton Village in April, Ms. DiSiena said in an email last Thursday, February 2, “This meeting was co-opted, renamed and re-branded by a group of liberal activists who were already holding strategy meetings to turn it into a disruptive show for their own political theater.” \nHow long does he think he can hide from constituents who have a valid reason for wanting to talk with him? You are going to have to come out and face the music sometime, Republicans. \nBravo to all of you NY-01 constituents who are willing to fight for change. Keep up the great work. Be relentless. Most importantly, find a challenger for Lee Zeldin in 2018 and get to work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:15:16.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
