Round-trip tickets start at $321, with availability from major East Coast cities including Boston , Fort Lauderdale, Miami, New York City , and Philadelphia. \nFor the best dates, search for flights in October and November — though the Thrifty Traveler found good deals in the final weeks of summer and as late as February. \nTravel + Leisure found $323 flights from New York City to Barcelona , for example (and a non-stop option for only $369). Boston-based travelers, meanwhile, can visit Madrid for only $321 round-trip. And travelers based in Miami can visit southern Spain’s new culture capital, Málaga , for a cool $402. \nTicket prices and travel dates will vary depending on the destination, and travelers can choose from virtually any city in Portugal (Porto or Lisbon, for example) or Spain (Barcelona, Granada, Seville, Madrid). Even the Spanish islands, including Ibiza and Mallorca, are steeply discounted. \nAs Thrifty Traveler notes, many flights are with full-service airlines, meaning you don’t need to worry about paying for checked luggage or seat assignments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:06:41.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
