For one group, that is retrofitting new technologies onto old devices to bring them into the internet of things. For another, they aim to use modern manufacturing capability to inexpensively scale down complex sensor systems into a small everyday device to provide life-saving information. And for the third, it’s bringing modern materials and manufacturing technology together in a way that hasn’t been done before. \nThe three teams of four students were selected from a pool of 32 students on nine teams. They will be in Austin March 11-12 to work on their innovations and present them to a group of industry judges, competing for award funding. \nThe first team of students includes Magy Avedissian, petroleum engineering; Nga Tang, medical student; and Joey Wippold and Kurt Parizek, biomedical engineering. \nThe second team includes Philip Bowie, electrical and computer engineering; Coleman Fincher, mechanical engineering; Wesley Kuenh, manufacturing and mechanical engineering technology; and Jana Soares, MBA candidate. \nThe final team includes Momore Adesanmi, chemical engineering; Bhavani Bedre Shankar, computer science and engineering; James O’Connell, mechanical engineering; and Pavan Shetty, electrical and computer engineering. \nAggies Invent promotes an innovation and entrepreneurial mindset among students at Texas A&M University. It gathers invited students, provides them with the needs statements submitted by sponsors, allows them to self-select teams, and gives them access to industry mentors and support from the Engineering Innovation Center (EIC) to create solutions and prototypes in 48 hours. \nFor more information and to sign up to receive email updates about Texas A&M’s participation in SXSW, visit sxsw.tamu.edu . \nFor more information on SXSW, visit sxsw.com .
