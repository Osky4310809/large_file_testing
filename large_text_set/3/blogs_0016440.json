Cut a couple sweet potatoes in half lengthwise, toss with salt, pepper, and oil, and bake, cut side against a parchment-lined baking sheet, until soft (about 45 minutes at 400° F). Turn them over, use a fork to loosen up their insides, then add the cooked chickpeas and the cheese of your choice (feta, goat, tiny mozzarella hunks—all good choices) and return to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cheese has softened. Sprinkle with herbs and something crunchy (like toasted hazelnuts or pepitas). Spinach meld . With a little help from some breadcrumbs, you can unite your cooked chickpeas with spinach (or another green of choice) without making a fancy sauce. You'll wilt the spinach, then toast cubes of bread in garlic, cumin, fresh oregano, and crumbled chile (or chile flakes) in another skillet before mashing them up with red wine vinegar. Add the chickpeas to the bread paste pan and cook until the flavors meld, then stir the wilted greens in and cook until heated through. Serve over bread or rice, with a fried egg on top.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:14:48.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
