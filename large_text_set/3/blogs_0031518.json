The good news? Sarah, a.k.a. Laura Linney appears in the Love Actually sequel.\n“But I saw it already and she’s not in it!” Fear not, my friend — she’s returning for the U.S. version , which is airing May 25 on NBC. According to Entertainment Weekly, she will be filming her scenes in April.\n“I’d done something for the last Red Nose Day,” Linney told EW. “So I’d kept in touch with [ Love Actually writer and director] Richard Curtis.” \n“And then he sent me an email, explaining this short film reunion ,” she continues. “I said yes, obviously. How could I say no? And right away we were figuring out our schedules.” We think we speak for everyone when we say:\nIn case you need a refresher, the Karl/Sarah storyline was the MOST frustrating storyline in the entire movie. Poor Sarah is an American office worker in love with her hot graphic designer colleague Karl (played by actor Rodrigo Santoro), and she finally gets him alone and sparks fly.\n“Rodrigo [Santoro] and I were both heartbroken at the time we made the film. We’d both recently been through terrible relationships and were bemoaning that moment in our lives,” Linney added to EW. “But we both got to make each other feel better all day long. I think you can see it in the scene after I do my Snoopy dance in the doorway: two injured people finding each other .” But there’s a catch: Sarah is also her mentally ill brother’s only family member in London, and he has her on speed dial from the facility he stays at — and he uses said speed dial multiple times a day, to the point where even her boss Harry (RIP Alan Rickman) notices.\nHarry also picks up on the fact Sarah is in head over heels love with K hl — something she admits has been the case for over two years, literally half an hour after she started her first work day — and encourages her to “do something about it…for all our sakes.”\nSo she does. She dances with Karl at the Christmas party (where Harry flirts shamelessly with his secretary Mia in front of his wife Emma Thompson Karen), and then they go back to her place and are totally about to get it on when Sarah has to answer multiple calls from her brother.\nThe worst part, though, is that Karl seems to understand and is super empathetic but for some reason, it still doesn’t work out . Why, Sarah, why!? Look at him!\nAt least we Karl fans have been able to catch Rodrigo Santoro on TV in LOST and Westworld since then , but we can’t help but wonder what became of Karl and Sarah’s romance. Did Sarah ever find a balance that was enough for her and Karl to sustain a relationship? Did they at least hook up ?\nWe’re trying not to get our hopes up one way or the other. In fact, Curtis’ longtime partner — Emma Freud, who edited the original film’s script and produced Red Nose Day Actually — put any wondering to rest on Twitter in 2015.\n“Tragic, I’m afraid,” she tweeted of the relationship’s fate . \nWe hope that “tragic” just means that the way they ended up getting together was tragic but that everything turned out OK in the end. Also, there’s no word yet on whether Santoro will be filming alongside Linney, so fingers crossed!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:17:11.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
