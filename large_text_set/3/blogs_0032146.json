The 17-inch touchscreen that dominates the Tesla Model S center panel is basically already a huge digital surface primed for drawing, so it’s a natural add-on – not counting that most of the time, you’re going to be using the screen while driving, of course. \n— Nik Jovanovic (@jovanik21) March 30, 2017 \nAbove, you can see Twitter user and Canadian Tesla owner Nik Jovanovic using the new Easter Egg virtual easel in his car. The choice of subject is excellent, depicting the true power source of the Tesla Model S, and it clearly impressed Elon Musk: The Tesla CEO tweeted this image, along with a rudimentary Mona Lisa, when he revealed the nature of the new Easter Egg himself. \nI really do love drawing, and I was saving up for a $3,000 Surface Studio to help indulge that hobby. Maybe I’ll just save up an additional $97,000 or so and get a Tesla instead, since I also like driving – two birds, one stone. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T15:15:40.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
