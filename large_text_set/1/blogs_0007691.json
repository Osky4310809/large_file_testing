Dundalk standoff has ended. Police say the suspect surrendered peacefully — he was upset someone bit into his grilled cheese sandwich #WBAL \n— Vanessa Herring (@VanessaWBAL) January 9, 2017 \nBaltimore County police spokesman Shawn Vinson says the dispute began about 5 p.m. Sunday at a Dundalk home. He says the man was eating with his wife and daughter, and became angry when one of them took a bite from his sandwich, prompting him to fire a shot inside the house. \nThe wife and daughter were able to safely leave the house, but the man barricaded himself inside. He surrendered peacefully shortly before 9 p.m. \nNo one was injured. \nPolice took the man to a hospital for an evaluation. Vinson says the man will face charges. \nFollow @CBSDC on Twitter \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
