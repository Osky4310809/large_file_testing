The news arrives via Android Police , who received word that people involved in the Moto Z “Feedback Network” are being asked if they would like to take part in the trial program.\nLenovo is reportedly aiming to move “quickly” with regards to the update process and has already confirmed a March rollout for the final software (details on which you can read at the link below.) Those that wish to take part must have a good standing in the Moto Owners Forum also, but it’s unclear whether those who own the Verizon branded Moto Z Play Droid will have access to the same testing phase.\nMeanwhile, it was recently confirmed that the higher spec’d Moto Z would receive Android Nougat in February.\nSee also: Nougat update for unlocked Moto Z due in February, Moto Z Play in March 7 days ago Owners of the unlocked Moto Z devices have been left disappointed by Lenovo’s recent rollout schedule, as the Verizon Moto Z variants, the Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Force Droid, were upgraded to Android Nougat last November . Lenovo’s going to have to make sure it sticks to the announced timeline if it wants to avoid any further backlash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T16:44:13.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
