People are victims of these crimes.\" \nThe suspects, 17-year-old Jose Montano from El Salvador and 18-year-old Henry Sanchez from Guatemala, entered the U.S. illegally. Sanchez has an ICE detainer for deportation and both have been in the country for just eight months. \nSpicer called the assault horrific and emphasized the need for local authorities to work with federal immigration officials to address the situation. . @PressSec says rape of girl at school is “horrific” and adds, “Immigration pays its toll on our people if it’s not done legally.” pic.twitter.com/RGbwifXCrt", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:05:00.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
