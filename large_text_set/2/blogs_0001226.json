Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters 3) Sunderland’s other players need to step up \nHere is a fact that probably will not surprise you: Jermain Defoe is, in terms of contribution to goals (scoring and setting up), Sunderland’s most important player. But the extent to which he is might raise some eyebrows: Defoe has provided either the assist or final touch for 70% of his team’s goals. The next on the Premier League list is Álvaro Negredo, responsible for 52% of Middlesbrough’s goals. The last time a Sunderland player other than Defoe scored a goal was Fabio Borini’s consolation against Manchester United on Boxing Day. The last time a Sunderland player other than Defoe scored a goal that had a direct impact on the match result was Patrick van Aanholt a week or so earlier . At this stage, the rest of their players might as well not bother crossing the halfway line. This is a roundabout way of making a relatively straightforward point, but it is worth emphasising just how heavily Sunderland rely on their 34-year-old striker. Their other players, to put things lightly, need to step up, pronto, starting at Selhurst Park where they meet their old boss Sam Allardyce’s Crystal Palace.

On Wednesday Koeman hinted that Lookman might receive his full debut sooner rather than later – why not against the Cherries, whose defence can be a little questionable?

Of course, the players of Southampton have the small matter of the EFL Cup final to think about and would not be human if they did not already have one eye on their Wembley appointment with Manchester United on the final Sunday of this month. With Southampton’s Premier League safety more or less a given, Claude Puel’s decision to field a second-string team against Arsenal in last weekend’s FA Cup fourth-round tie was greeted with general bafflement. However, the subsequent slaughter means his team will have a fortnight to prepare for their first major final since 2003. Having already lost against Swansea City in the Premier League since qualifying for the League Cup final, Saints must face West Ham and Sunderland before Wembley. It is an ideal opportunity to get their exciting new bargain acquisition Manolo Gabbiadini acquainted with the rhythms of English football before Sunday 26 February, but otherwise his new team-mates could be forgiven for not over-exerting themselves before the looming big day. BG \n• Sigurdsson sinks Saints and keeps Swansea looking up 6) Silva given a near-impossible task \nOne wonders if Hull’s board told Marco Silva at his job interview that, as he took over a club heading for relegation largely thanks to a deficient squad, they would be selling a couple of his key players. They kept hold of Andy Robertson, but Robert Snodgrass and Jake Livermore were moved on, for respectable fees, and replaced by a collection of eight recruits that could come off, or could disappear without a trace. Perhaps it is a logical move – given that the existing players were the ones who had got them in trouble in the first place they might as well get some new ones in – but it is a risky one. Lazar Markovic looked off the pace straightaway when he joined Liverpool (Hull’s opponents this weekend), Andrea Ranocchia carries a whiff of slapstick and Oumar Niasse is – how to word this politely – a little erratic. Still, Evandro looks lively and Kamil Grosicki should give them some spark. Should Silva get Hull out of this mess, in these circumstances, he will be in contention for manager of the year. NM \n• Hull hold Manchester United as Mourinho’s demands fall short 7) Does Burnley’s terrible away record matter? \nOnly Chelsea have won more home games than Burnley. No one has fewer away points than Burnley. It seems churlish in the extreme to tick off Sean Dyche about how his team’s season is going, because they are ninth and could probably down tools for the remainder of the season and still stay up. But if they had even an average record on the road – say, three wins and three draws – then they would be on Manchester United’s heels. It is fairly extraordinary that a team can reach this stage of the season and contrive to only pick up a single point away from home, but that is what Burnley have done. However, their next three away games are Saturday at Watford, then Hull, then Swansea. They will have no better time to cure their travel sickness.
