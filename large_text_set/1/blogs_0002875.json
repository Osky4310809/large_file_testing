PC Magazine has more details: The law would reportedly apply to other social networks as well . \"If after the relevant checks Facebook does not immediately, within 24 hours, delete the offending post then [it] must reckon with severe penalties of up to 500,000 euros,\" Germany's parliamentary chief of the Social Democrat party Thomas Oppermann said in an interview with Germany's Der Spiegel magazine, according to a report from Heat Street. Under the law, \"official and private complainants\" would be able to flag news on Facebook as fake, Heat Street reported. Facebook and other affected social networks would have to create \"in-country offices focused on responding to takedown demands,\" the report says. The bill, slated for consideration next year, is said to have bipartisan support. According to the article, \"Lawmakers in the country are reportedly hoping it will prevent Russia from interfering in Germany's elections next year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T16:52:58.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
