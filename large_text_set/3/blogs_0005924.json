You have more pressure in the bigger games than the smaller ones and we deliver in the bigger games,'' said Wijnaldum. \n\"We have to make sure at the end of the season we are there [in the top four]. \n\"We have to have a good run and be confident we can finish in one of the spots but if we are going to do it like we did before, playing well and then playing bad again, then it is going to be tough for us to come in the top four. \n\"You can't afford to lose games. It is always possible that you will not win but it is the way you play the game. Liverpool defeated Arsenal 3-1 on Saturday. \n\"You must play with the same intention: to win the game and give everything you have.'' \nAfter Monday's woeful 3-1 defeat at Leicester Klopp said everyone was playing for their futures. \nWijnaldum said this did not come as a surprise to the squad. \n\"It doesn't matter what the manager said, you play for Liverpool so everyone has to perform,'' he added. \n\"Of course it is a young group who can develop more during the time we are together but on the other hand everyone expects a lot from us. \n\"Every game we have to deliver and that is what we must think about.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:04:51.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
