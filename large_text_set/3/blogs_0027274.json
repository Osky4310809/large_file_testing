It’s Donald Trump here.’ I said, ‘Really? What? Can I help you?’”\n(The gifted actress has not mastered her Trump impression. In her telling, he sounds more Texan than New Yorker.)\nTrump offered her “accommodation” in one of his properties, she recounted, bragging that they were “really comfortable.”\nThompson, perhaps not understanding the offer of a hotel room to be a romantic gesture, said she asked him, “Why are you offering me somewhere to stay in my trailer?”\n“Well, you know, I think we would get on very well, maybe we could have dinner some time,” she said Trump responded.\nTurning to the host, she said: “I didn’t know what to do with myself!”\nAccording to IMDB, “Primary Colors” filmed from May 5 to Aug. 4, 1997. Trump announced his separation from second wife Marla Maples in May of the same year. Their divorce was finalized in 1999.\nThompson said she quickly ended the call, blowing off Trump with an “I’ll get back to you.”\nSkavlan, the host of the show, sat agog during Thompson’s storytelling, eyes wide and mouth open.\n“Just to be clear, you never met him before?” he asked.\n“No, I’d never met him,” she said.\n“You’ve never met him since?” he asked.\n“I’ve never met him since.”\nIt’s hard to believe the model-loving Republican president once held a candle for a woman Meryl Streep has described as a “rabid man-eating feminist like me.” But in the 1990s, Thompson was still establishing her career in the American market, so her political leanings may not have been as well-known. And at the time, Trump was still wavering between the Democrats and the GOP.\nThompson was also just coming off of the film “Sense and Sensibility,” arguably one of her most traditionally romantic roles.\nStill, Thompson said she regrets not taking Trump up on his offer.\n“Think of the stories!” she said.\n“You could be the first lady,” Skavlan joked.\nIn a bizarre simulacrum, Thompson’s “Primary Colors” character was based on former first lady Hillary Clinton — Trump’s eventual presidential opponent, whom he has described as “the devil.”\n‘Feminism is not a stick with which to beat other women’: Emma Watson tells off critics of revealing photo\nA lawyer named Amal Clooney gave a powerful speech at the U.N.
