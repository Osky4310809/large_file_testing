Shiite Leader, Sheik Ibrahim El-zakzaky \nEmphasising that no permit was given for the protest, Manzah said the leaders of the protest march will be charged to court for unlawful assembly. \nVanguard learned that the protesters disguised themselves as passengers in some commuter buses, pretending to be going to the Central District of the city. But that on getting to the Federal Secretariat junction at 9.30a.m., they disembarked and commenced the protest. \nPolicemen attached to the Federal Secretariat Police Division had to call for reinforcement from the Command Headquarters before the situation, which had turned violent, could be brought under control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T08:10:05.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
