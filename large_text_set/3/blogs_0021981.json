Philstar.com/File photo \nZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines - Combined Marines and Navy officers rescued Thursday pre-dawn two Malaysians held captives for eights months in Sulu, according to officials. \nThe rescued victims were identified as Tayudin Anjut, 45 and Abdul Rahim Bin Summas, 62, according to Capt. Jo-Ann Petinglay, spokesperson of the Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom). \nThe victims were among the five remaining crew members of Tugboat Serudung seized by the Abu Sayyaf bandits led by sub-leaders Jaber Susukan and Sibbih Pissih, under Yasser Ygasan’s group last July 19, 2016 at the seawater of Dent Haven, Tambisan, Lahad Datu, Sabah. \nMaj. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., Westmincom commander, said elements of the Marine Battalion Landing Team 1 (MBLT) Special Operations Group and naval sailors under the Joint Task Force Sulu (JTFS) rescued Anjut and Summas about 2 a.m. at coastal area of Barangay Karudong, Kalinggalang Caluang, fronting Pata Island. \nGalvez said the Marines launched the operation after receiving leads that Abu Sayyaf sub-leader Alhabsy Misaya with about 30 fully armed followers and two Malaysian hostages were hiding at the mangrove area in Barangay Karudong. \nThe troops led by Maj. Angcap caught up with the Abu Sayyaf group who were forced to abandon their captives.   \nThe two rescued captives were immediately brought to the military hospital in Camp Teodulfo Bautista in Barangay Bus-bus, Jolo town for medical treatment. \n“The rescued kidnap victims were both weak and sick,” Galvez said, citing reports from JTFS commander Col. Cirilito Sobejana. \nAccording to Galvez, the continuous pursuit operations against the group of Misaya since last month in Capual Island have already left seven of Misaya’s followers killed. \nThe military said that with the rescue of the two victims, the number of hostages remained at 30. Captives of the Abu Sayyaf include 11 Vietnamese, a Dutch, a Korean, seven Indonesians, three Malaysians, and eight Filipinos. \nAccording to Petinglay, troops continued the pursuit operations to recover the remaining hostages held by different Abu Sayyaf factions in Sulu.
