It was, in every sense of the word, insane.\nFor their performance, the Mob created a mock-hospital on the stage, and emerged in wheelchairs being pushed out by very attractive nurses. At one point, A$AP Ferg even comes out wearing a straight jacket. It was one of the more dramatic performances from the group, which took the song’s title in the most literal way possible.\nAt this point, the Mob is getting quite good at playing material from Cozy Tapes . Earlier this week, footage emerged of the group’s full set at this year’s Art Basel Miami, which you can re-watch below.\n\nIn other music news, Meek Mill has now challenged Drake to an IRL boxing match, continuing 2017’s hottet rap trend.
