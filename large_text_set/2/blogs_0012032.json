Of course, it would all be easier if history had recorded more times of peace than war, and invaders didn’t go around burning libraries and sacking cities, we might still have complete records of what the world looked like in ancient times. Can you imagine what we’d know if the Library of Alexandria was still complete? We’d know more stuff about the ancient world than we do now, that’s for sure. Instead, we have to rely on what we have; vague descriptions of locations, long forgotten myths, technologies and biographies of significant people. \nFor example, take the myth of Atlantis. Plato’s writings talked about an advanced civilization that fell out of favour with the Gods, then sunk into the sea. The Egyptians also had a similar story of an island called Thonis (which the Greeks called Heracleion), that sunk into the sea one day. Both recollections make it sound like this was a tangible place, but no one knows where they were and if they existed. \nBut what if both stories are correct? What if there was an island that was reclaimed by the water, that was full of knowledge and riches. And what if it might have been found? 2 \nThonis-Heracleion is a lost city that lives below the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. More than 1,200 years ago, a cataclysmic event wiped the city off of the face of the earth, leaving myths, legends and tall tales in its wake. 3 \nSome of the myths are key to what we know about Greek history. For example, there’s a story told by Homer that indicates that the Greek Prince Paris, after seducing Helen of Troy and abducting her, fled the wrath of her husband Menelaus and they ended up hiding in this city, before making their way back to Troy. \nThe city also claims to have been host to the legendary Hercules while he was out doing his labours, and hence got the name Heracleion. \nBoth accounts, however, are taken by historians with a grain of salt. If there really was an island off the coast of Alexandria, there’d be evidence, right? 4 \nReally though, it just takes imagination sometimes, and the will to see it through. This is where French archeologist Franck Goddio comes in. A legend in his own right, he left a career in finance in the early ’80’s to focus on underwater archeology, which was his first passion. After founding the Institut European d’archeologie Sous-Marine (IEASM) in Paris, he set out to methodically find lost shipwrecks and sunken cities. \nTo date he’s found Spanish Galleons, the lost fleet of Napoleon, ships from the British East India Company, and in 2000, he discovered Thonis-Heracleion. \nHe’s also gained some notoriety for finding a cup inscribed with a Greek reference to “Christ”, dating from the second century C.E. So he’s even possibly found the Holy Grail. He’s Indiana Jones and Nathan Drake, all in one. 5 Franckgoddio.org \nBut this lost city… this is his passion project. While the majority of the find dates back to 2000, he’s been searching for evidence of this lost city since 1992 and while he’s now lecturing at Oxford, writing papers, filming documentaries and writing books, he’s still going back to the Mediterranean Sea to keep on digging up parts of Thonis-Heracleion to this day.
