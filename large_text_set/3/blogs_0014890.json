FBI Director Comey refuses to deny he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael Flynn to Russia. pic.twitter.com/cUZ5KgBSYP \n— President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017 \n“FBI Director Comey refuses to deny he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael Flynn to Russia,” Trump tweeted in his first salvo of the hearing, following several pre-hearing jabs.   Trump’s 5-Year-Old Grandson Breaks Leg In Accident \nThe genesis of that tweet was Comey’s reply to a question from Rep. Trey Gowdy asking that very question. \n“I’m not going to get into either that particular case or any conversations I had with the president. I can’t answer that,” he said, stating he could not divulge classified information \nNational Security Agency Director Michael Rogers’ testimony also drew a Trump tweet. Rogers was asked if there was any proof Russian hackers impacted the voting in key states.   \n“I have nothing generated by the national security industry,” Rogers answered. The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process. pic.twitter.com/d9HqkxYBt5 \n— President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017 \n“The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process,” Trump tweeted. \nHe followed that with a later tweet after Comey voiced a similar conclusion.   \n— President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017 \n“FBI Director Comey: fmr. DNI Clapper “right” to say no evidence of collusion between Russia and Trump Campaign. ‪#ComeyHearing ,” Trump tweeted \nTrump also noted Comey’s comments about leaks. Leaked information has stalked Trump’s presidency. FBI Director Comey says classified leaks to the media have been “unusually active” recently. pic.twitter.com/WumDJSqaFA \n— President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017 \n“FBI Director Comey says classified leaks to the media have been ‘unusually active’ recently,” Trump tweeted. \nTrump, who has alleged former President Barack Obama approved surveillance of him before the election, noted that FBI Director Comey admits Obama’s White House had ability to “unmask” American citizens. \nMasking, in the world of surveillance, refers to protecting the identities of Americans who are inadvertently caught up in surveillance. Unmasking means revealing those identities. FBI Director Comey admits Obama’s White House had ability to “unmask” American citizens. https://t.co/gIo6it9NcQ \n— President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017 NSA Director Rogers tells Congress unmasking individuals endangers national security. pic.twitter.com/jTwjPINvNh \n— President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017 \nTrump’s tweets, which came from his official presidential account, followed a morning of tweets form his private account peppering the media and Democrats with criticism. The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 \nThe U.S. intelligence community has said that Russia sought to meddle in the election. \nThe FBI has been looking into any ties between Trump advisers and Russian agents during the campaign. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, whose ties to pro-Russia officials in Ukraine have been widely reported, resigned in August as the campaign changed direction. Flynn, Trump’s selection as national security adviser, was forced to resign after it was learned he lied to administration officials about the nature of phone calls he had with Russia’s ambassador.
