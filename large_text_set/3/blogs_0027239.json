Many of the longest running and most successful record labels are instantly recognisable by their logo. Here are 12 top examples of record label logo designs to inspire you.\n01. Sub Pop \nSub Pop deliberately chose a stark, corporate logo to gain brand prominence Inspired by the clean lines of labels such as Blue Note and Motown , Sub Pop founder Bruce Pavitt had a very clear idea of how he wanted to brand his legendary Seattle label, Sub Pop. And decision to go for a stark, comparatively corporate design paid off in spades. \n\"We were trying to be very consistent in our packaging, very consistent in our sound, really putting focus on the region, in the same way that Motown put focus on Detroit Soul,\" Pavitt told Fast Company in 2012. \"We saw what was there; we connected the dots; and we tightened it up so that anyone in the world could pick up a record and go, &apos;oh, Sub Pop.&apos; We created fans that would pretty much buy anything on the label.\"\n02. Alternative Tentacles \nAlternative Tentacles has been keeping the homeland insecure since 1979 Established in 1979 as a label name for the Dead Kennedys&apos; self-produced single, California Über Alles, Alternative Tentacles swiftly became home to many of the leading lights of the American alternative and punk scenes, including Nomeansno, D.O.A and the Butthole Surfers. \nIts bat logo, designed by Winston Smith, a collage artist best known for his cut-up artwork for the Dead Kennedys, is a powerful punk-rock take on the Seal of the President of the United States.\n03. Factory Records \nThe Factory Records logo has become as iconic as the label itself Legendary Manchester-based label Factory Records launched in 1978, and featured several prominent musical acts – including Joy Division and The Happy Mondays – until the early 90s. The record label&apos;s iconic logo includes a graphic rendering of Manchester&apos;s industrial skyline.\n04.

The label was launched by EMI in 1969 to market progressive rock music, and was home to artists such as Deep Purple and Pink Floyd.\n05. Apple Records \nGene Mahon developed the concept for the internationally recognised symbol for Apple Records The corporate logo design for the Beatles&apos; multimedia company Apple Records was created by Gene Mahon. The simple yet effective design featured a bright green Granny Smith apple, obviously. Albums featured the common fruit whole on its A-side and the apple cut in half on its B-side.\n06. Nervous Records \nNervous Records can be recognised instantly by its cartoon character logo Founded back in 1991, Nervous Records can be recognised immediately by its eye-catching cartoon character logo.
