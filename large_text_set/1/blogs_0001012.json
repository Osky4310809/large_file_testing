Grace Poe, daughter of late veteran actor Fernando Poe Jr.(FPJ), on Monday sought for the review of the controversial dog slaughter scene in the film “Oro.” Philstar.com/File \nMANILA, Philippines – Sen. Grace Poe, daughter of late cinema legend Fernando Poe Jr., on Monday sought for the review of the controversial dog slaughter scene in the film “Oro.” \nThe senator, also the former Movie and Television Review and Classification Board chairperson, called on the Metro Manila Film Festival organizers to verify whether the dog in the film was actually butchered, citing an existing law on animal welfare. She called for an immediate investigation into the issue. \n“Artistic license does not justify the violation of our laws,” Poe said. \nPoe also said if proven that the animal cruelty in the scene actually occurred, she will move to invalidate the FPJ Memorial Award for Excellence award given to the film. \n“Though I am not part of the jury that decided on the award, it is my responsibility to uphold the values of FPJ. He would never condone an act of animal cruelty,” the senator said. \nPoe mentioned “Oro” film makers may face criminal liability if the dog killing scene is found to have been real. Entertainment ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nShe added that the MMFF should also consider applicable administrative sanctions against them for any misrepresentation before the MMFF selection committee on this matter which in itself may already justify the movie being stripped of any and all awards it received among other sanctions. \nOn Monday morning, the MMFF executive committee held an inquiry to clarify the issue between the film makers and complainant Philippine Animal Welfare Society. PAWS said it will file charges against the film makers. \nThe film makers denied the animal cruelty allegations. \nOn Thursday, “Oro” received two awards including the FPJ Memorial Award for Excellence and Best Ensemble Cast while lead actress Irma Adlawan won best actress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:54:02.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
