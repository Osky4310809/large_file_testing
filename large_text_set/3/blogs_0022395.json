On the day of procedures kids can’t eat. Ari had his food and water taken away every day .” The Schultz family.

But then, he said they learned that the home’s structural integrity was compromised. One contractor said they had a “sick house.” \n“Home just got a little further away. For all of us,” he wrote. \nThe family said they’ll need help to build a new home for Ari and his siblings. \nIf you would like to donate to help the family, visit their GoFundMe page .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:57:04.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
