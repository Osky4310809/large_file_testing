Our correspondent learnt that although they were repelled by troops attached to the 28 Task Force Battalion, there was a gun battle that was said to have lasted for an hour between the insurgents and the soldiers. Meanwhile, the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.Gen. Sani Usman, warned on Tuesday that anyone, including politicians, suspected to be hiding fleeing Boko Haram insurgents, would face the wrath of the law. A military source said the attack on Dar village was contained by the troops and the local vigilance group members. The military spokesman in Mubi, Adamawa State, Maj. Akintoye Badare, said the troops did not record any casualty as the attack was successfully contained. “There was an attack on Dar village but we successfully repelled it; there was no casualty on our side,” he said. It was gathered that some members of the sect were killed during the attack. Usman, speaking in an interview on the arrest of a local government chairman in Borno State, said the army would not cover up anyone. The chairman, Shettima Mafa, had reported himself to the 7 Division, Maiduguri, Borno State, on the allegation that he kept a Boko Haram terrorist in his house. Usman said the army would hand over people found to be shielding the Boko Haram suspects to the police for prosecution. He said, “On the arrested politician shielding the Boko Haram suspect, you should understand our roles that we do not prosecute suspects. We hand over and we do not want to jeopardise the investigation process. Anybody caught will face the full wrath of the law and there is no exception. The general public should further cooperate with the security agencies.” A twin blast on December 9, 2016 at the Madagali Market had resulted in the death of many people.
