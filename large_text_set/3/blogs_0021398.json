The new iPad will start at $329, while the red iPhone 7 will cost $749. According to Mashable, the red iPhone 7 Plus will come in 128 GB and 256 GB configurations and set you back $749 and $849, respectively, while the 7 Plus will set you back $869 and $969 for the same configurations. \nJoswiak told Mashable the brand plans to make “a bunch” of the iPhones but didn’t specify how many, so I think it’s safe to assume this will be a limited edition. The phones go on sale this Friday and a portion of every sale will go to directly to The Global Fund so if you want to shop and contribute to a worthy cause before they’re all gone, put a note on your calendar now.
