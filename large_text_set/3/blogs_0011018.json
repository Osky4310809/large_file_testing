At one point it was thought she would use it to announce the triggering of article 50, but government sources are now briefing that that will not happen until the end of the month and so May will be reduced to talking about what was decided at what was a particularly dull and unremarkable European council. \nLuckily, though, questions will not be tightly restricted to what was on the summit agenda. These European council statements have become a Brexit free-for-all and so we will probably end up with May doing a 90-minute Q&A on leaving the EU. \nThe government is still saying it wants to conclude talks on a UK-EU trade deal within the two-year Brexit period but, on the Today programme this morning, the former European commission vice president Viviane Reding said that would be impossible. Reding, who is now an MEP for Luxembourg, told the programme: \nTwo years is out of the question. It is completely wishful thinking and unrealistic. \nShe also said voters in Europe were “fed up” with Brexit. \nThey are fed up, really fed up because they feel that a British problem is forced on us. It is not our problem, Brexit, we have never asked for this. It is also not our priority. It seems to be the British top priority, it is certainly not a European top priority. \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n9.45am: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. \n10am: Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the budget. \n11.45am: Sajid Javid, the business secretary, gives a speech to launch the Centre for Social Justice homelessness report \n12.30pm: Theresa May makes a statement in the Commons on last week’s EU summit. \n2.15pm: Google, Facebook and Twitter give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about hate crime. \n3.30pm: Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, gives evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee about Brexit and the labour market. \nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary before May’s statement and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:12:43.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
