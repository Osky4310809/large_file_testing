Guinigundo on Thursday told reporters that the policy setting Monetary Board recently decided to extend by another three months the deadline to exchange or replace New Design Series (NDS) banknotes with New Generation Currency (NGC) banknotes. \nLast December, the BSP moved the deadline to March 31. But Guinigundo said there was public clamor to again extend the deadline. ADVERTISEMENT \nAccording to Guinigundo, there remain 284 million pieces of NDS banknotes in circulation, or 8.6 percent of the total 3.3 billion pieces being used in cash transactions as of end-February. \nIn terms of value, the NDS banknotes yet to be exchanged with the BSP and its authorized agent-banks totaled P19.2 billion or a mere 2 percent of the P983.3-billion worth of banknotes in circulation. \nAs such, the NDS bills launched in 1985 will be demonetized on July 1. \nOriginally, the BSP scheduled demonetization of the NDS banknotes on Jan. 1 this year. \nIn July, only the NGC, the banknote series launched in 2010, can be used for daily transactions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:46:49.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
