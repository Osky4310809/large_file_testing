Updating to Nougat on this phone will end support for the ASUS Share Link app, which was supposed to assist with sharing files with other devices, although there are other Android apps that can do the same thing.\nSee also: ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe review December 6, 2016 The update will also remove the PC Suite app support, and the “Audio Wizard”, “Splendid”, “System update” and “Flashlight” shortcut icons will be removed from the “All apps” menu. Some live wallpapers, including Holo Spiral, Bubbles, Black Hole, and Phase Beam, are not compatible with Nougat, and thus will be removed from the phone after the update.\nFinally, the ZenFone 3 Deluxe will no longer support the phone’s “Shake Shake” feature. This was actually a nifty feature, as it let users take a screenshot of the display just by shaking the phone twice. The screenshot was also added automatically to the Do It Later app as a task. It’s too bad this handy feature from ASUS is going away with the Nougat update.\nRemember, it may take up to a week for your ZenFone 3 Deluxe to receive its Nougat update.
