After what feels like eons of teasing, Snapchatâ€™s pic-snapping, video-recording Snapchat Spectacles are finally available online for $129.99.\nPrior to its online release, Snapchat Spectacles were only available via vending machines called Snapbots. Snapbots would pop up at random locations and disappear without warning. If you wanted a pair you were doomed to track the bot or pay incredible markups on eBay.\nHereâ€™s how they work: to take a pic or record a 10-second clip, you tap a button on the upper left corner of the glasses. You can tap again to record a second and third video clip, but the glasses max out at 30 seconds chunks of time.\n#snÃ¤pchatspectacles ðŸ¦Šâœ¨ðŸ¤“ \nA post shared by Mrugesha Raul (@mrugeshaa) on Feb 4, 2017 at 3:16am PST \nWhen youâ€™re recording, youâ€™ll see an inward facing light and the corners of the specs will illuminate to let others know youâ€™re filming, although there are ways to hide this feature . The Snapchat Spectaclesâ€™ lens is 115 degrees to mimic eyesight so you donâ€™t have to worry about these Snaps not blending in with videos recorded from your phone.\nSnapchat 'Spectacles' Now Available for Online Ordering The much-anticipated video recording 'Spectacles' from photo-sharing service Snapchat is now available online for users in the US! #snapchat #spectacles #snÃ¤pchatspectacles \nA post shared by UnKick (@weareunkick) on Feb 21, 2017 at 2:37am PST \nIf you have an iPhone, the videos transfer to your phone via Bluetooth or wi-fi, Android users can use wi-fi to get their Snaps onto their devices. Snapchat Spectacles can hold up to 200 snaps and the battery power will last you for about a day, (donâ€™t worry, the inward facing light will warn you when your batteryâ€™s low.)\n#spectacles \nA post shared by JÃ©ssica Rebelo Beligni (@jebeligni) on Feb 20, 2017 at 8:53am PST \nSo far the glasses are only available in three colors, teal, black, and coral, but weâ€™re willing to bet that more shades and prints are on the way.
