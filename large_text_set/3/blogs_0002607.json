HJ \nA post shared by Hugh Jackman (@thehughjackman) on Mar 5, 2017 at 10:35am PST \nLogan, which is doing well at the box office and earning a lot of critical praise , is an emotional send-off to Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine.\nJackman played the role for nine films and 17 years, which made the weigh of this film something difficult for the actor and James Mangold to ignore–though the director admits to pushing against that feeling . The film’s success and that “feeling of finality” accompanied with the fact that this would also be Patrick Stewart’s final appearance as Professor X makes Logan an unforgettable addition to the X-Men films.\nIt was no doubt a moving experience for Jackman, whom we’ve followed through the good, the funny, and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. In this montage of fan art set to Johnny Cash’s “Hurt,” Jackman thanks his fans complete with appropriate credits. I’m not crying, you are.\n(via Comic Book Resources , Image via 20th Century Fox)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
