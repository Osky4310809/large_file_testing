(PTI) \nThe Supreme Court on Monday said that it would hear the petition that sought direction for a thorough check into the alleged tampering issue of the Electronic Voting Machines, most likely after 8 weeks. Earlier the Election Commission was issued notice by the apex court after a petition was filed alleging the tampering of the EVMs during the just concluded state assembly elections. The SC headed by the Chief Justice of India(CJI), Jagdish Singh Khekhar, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and D.Y. Chandrachud had issued the notice after lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma had filed the petition. \nTh petition had claimed that in the elections, that were concluded in the 5 states across the country, the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) had been tampered with and the machines should be checked thoroughly for the same. Sharma has said that American scientists would be conducting the investigation on the EVMs. Although, the SC had then refused to give any judgement on the matter of having a CBI inquiry for the same. \nAlso watch: \nFollowing the Bhartiya Janata Partyâ€™s landslide victory in the Uttar Pradesh state assembly elections Many politicians led by Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had alleged that the EVMs had been tampered with and challenged the BJP to go for elections involving ballot papers. Delhi CM had even suggested that the upcoming Delhi Municipal Corporation Polls. The EC had however stated that the EVMs could not be tampered with and said that the integrity of the process had been preserved as the technical and administrative measures taken would not allow any tampering. But if any such irregularities were found in some specific cases, the EC said that it could be looked into. Meanwhile, Anna Hazare remained of the opinion that using ballot boxes for elections was pushing the country back in terms of development.
