These four real-life proposals didn’t quite end up as planned. \nFAILED BASKETBALL GAME PROPOSAL \nTough break for sure, but at least the guy probably got some free Rockets tickets out of it. \nFAILED WATERFALL PROPOSAL \nProps for proposing next to a beautiful, scenic waterfall, but next time bring a wetsuit in case of emergency. \nFAILED MALL PROPOSAL \nCouple pro tips here: Don’t propose to your girl after only knowing her for 3 months. Don’t propose to your girl in the middle of a mall. Don’t propose to your girl while some band you hired serenades her in the background. Don’t paraphrase Bruno Mars while proposing to your girl. And if you’re going to do all these things despite all our warnings, please make sure you’ve at least scheduled your proposal around the kids’ train that periodically runs through the mall. Also, wear a helmet. \nFAILED FOOD COURT PROPOSAL \nNOW WHAT DID WE JUST TELL YOU? \nBefore you pull out all the stops and pop the question at an exotic location, learn from these men who aced their proposals to make sure you blow your future bride away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:40:01.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
