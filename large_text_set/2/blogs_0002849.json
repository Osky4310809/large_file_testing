(Which, for the record, is not athleisure.) Because even though most of us focus on the working out part of work out, some of us focus on the look—which is totally cool, too. We're partial to our favorite pair of leggings from eight years ago, but we're just as enamoured with a head-to-toe Lululemon or Outdoor Voices. (If you don't know Outdoor Voices, here's an example of why they're chic AF.) But then, there's Mariah, who is just in a league of her own, and you guys, it's glorious. Her workout ensemble included a leotard, diamonds, fishnets, and insanely high stilettos, because when you're Mariah Carey, what the hell else do you do? Carey tagged her personal trainer Gunnar Peterson in the three of Instagrams she shared showing of the sweat session (say that five times fast), proving that the celeb workout guru also has a secret side hustle: photography. Or, more accurately, Instagram-taking, that included a few different Boomerangs, 20-lb. weights and a crazy climber. Because when you're doing vertical climbing, why wear any kind of sneaker or hiking boot when you can just wear a pair of Fenty Pumas by Rihanna?
