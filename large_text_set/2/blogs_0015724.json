Per Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet (via the Liverpool Echo 's James Pearce ), Klopp said, \" I love Danish footballers,\" as he named 19-year-old Dolberg as a talent to watch: \" Who doesn’t know Dolberg? You can’t play at Ajax without being noticed. He has a great future ahead. He is a fantastic player.\" Striker Dolberg has netted 10 goals and provided five assists in the Eredivisie in 2016-17, his first campaign as a part of the Ajax first team, per WhoScored.com . Already a Denmark international, Dolberg is a very exciting prospect with a number of different weapons in his armoury. A natural goalscorer and excellent on the ball, the youngster is also a threat in the air. See some of what he can do below: He could potentially be a fine fit in Liverpool's current attack, as he would work well in Klopp's intricate tactical setup. The German manager also revealed that he signed current Manchester United winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan instead of Tottenham Hotspur 's Eriksen and Manchester City 's Kevin De Bruyne while at Dortmund. According to Klopp, the creative trio, all of whom are now hugely important to their respective clubs, were all on BVB's radar before the German side signed Mkhitaryan in 2013, per Ekstra Bladet (via Pearce): \nWhen I was in Dortmund we were very interested in Eriksen, but we had to choose between him, Mkhitaryan and (Kevin) De Bruyne. Christian Eriksen is a great player. Everyone would love to have him on their team. At that time we had three players we went after—Henrikh Mkhitariyan, Kevin de Bruyne and Christian Eriksen. We scouted all three very intensely, but we knew we could only get one. We were happy to get Mkhitaryan. Since then Christian Eriksen has taken a great step at Tottenham. He’s very strong. Klopp recently said Liverpool are already in talks about various summer signings, with Bayer Leverkusen winger Julian Brandt, 20, expected to be a key target, per Pearce . Greater creative depth is needed in the Liverpool squad if the Anfield outfit are to launch a genuine title challenge, and Klopp's skill at developing younger players could pay dividends if the Reds can bring in talent like Dolberg and Brandt.
