He makes a good movement, runs in behind, and you have to use him close to Sergio [Aguero], close to our strikers.\" \n'Alexis wants to stay at Arsenal!' \nGuardiola also urged fans and media not to expect too much of Jesus, who has made a blistering start to his Brazil career with five goals in six games and scored 12 times to help Palmeiras win the league title for the first time in over 20 years. \n\"He's 19-20 years old, so he's so, so young,\" he added. \"He's strong because, when you are able to play as a No.9 for Brazil, I think it's good, but I don't want to put him under a lot of pressure, saying that he has to solve our problems. What he has to do is play as freely as possible and score as many goals as possible when he's going to play and I think he's going to help us in that.\" \nJesus may not be the only new arrival at the Etihad Stadium this month, with Guardiola keen to sign defensive reinforcements. \nCity have been linked with a move for Sevilla midfielder Steven N'Zonzi, who has a buy-out clause of Â£25.6 million. \nFrom non-league to Arsenal in 48 hours \nBut Guardiola would not be drawn on the speculation, insisting that \"now is not the moment to talk\". The City boss did suggest, however, that he has no need to bring in a midfielder. \n\"Since I am manager from Manchester City, we are interested in a thousand million players so we are going to play with the team. If we need something, maybe it's at the back, central defenders or full-backs, maybe, but that is a position we have cover enough and the next season is the next season.\" \nGoal reported earlier this week that City are indeed open to signing a midfielder this month , albeit on a short-term basis, to cover for the absence of the injured Ilkay Gundogan.
