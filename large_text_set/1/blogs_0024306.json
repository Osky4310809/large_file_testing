First STIs are experienced the most there too... \nAnd again, the playful Welsh dominate when it comes to fantasising, at 28%. They are more likely to use a sex toy as well – as 33% admit trying it. \nBut role play is one for the English,15% of whom have tried it as a first in middle-age – rising to 22% in London. And the Northern Irish lead in sexting outside your relationship post-40, with 11% fessing up. With the kids gone and HRT, the cougar in a woman is growling \nBy KATHY LETTE, best-selling author \nI do all my research in an in-depth, scientific fashion – ie over cocktails with girlfriends. And what I’ve gleaned is that women definitely hit their sexual peak in their 50s and 60s. \nWhy? Well, truly mind-blowing sex is only really possible when a woman learns to let go, when she’s not preoccupied with holding in her stomach or worried if her breasts are big enough or bottom small enough. \nAnd by middle age most women are comfortable in their skin. We’re no longer spending a fortune on cellulite “miracle” creams (so-called because it’s a miracle anyone would be stupid enough to fork out a hundred quid for it) because we’ve finally worked out that looking good naked is a case of mind over matter – if you don’t mind, it don’t matter. \nAlso, once you hit your 50s, the kids have left home. A woman’s sex life definitely deteriorates with the onset of motherhood. Despite the beanbags and the water births and the plinky- plonky harp music, giving birth still boils down to a doctor putting a knee on your chest, spreading your legs and diving in with a pair of barbecue tongs. \nWhich is why a new mum’s favourite position is the “doggy position” – where he begs and she rolls over and plays dead. \nAnd even when a mum’s sex drive gets back in gear, kids are a contraceptive. Every time you want to make love the toddler toddles in or the teenager bursts through the door to nab the car keys. (My top sex tip for parents – Vaseline... on the doorknobs. Sounds painful but they can’t get in!) \nParents can also forget eroticism. The only times mums “talk dirty” is when ordering our kids to wash their hands before dinner and pointing out their rooms are a pigsty. \nAnd as for Fifty Shades-type S&M? Well, sure, mums get beaten all the time – mostly at Monopoly. \nBut with an empty nest and HRT, middle-aged women are ready for their last hormonal hoorah. The stereotypical scenario is that older men chase younger women. But, in reality, all my cougar girlfriends are stalking the urban jungle on the hunt for toyboys. \nAnd this dynamic makes sense. Think about it. Males hit their sexual prime in their late teens and women in their 50s. \nDo the maths – 19 goes into 60 a hell of a lot more than 60 goes into 19. \nHappy hunting, girls! \n- Kathy Lette has written 13 best-selling novels about the sex war.
