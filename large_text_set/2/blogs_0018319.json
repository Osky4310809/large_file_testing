According to Calciomercato , the Nerazzurri want to sign a rising star of Italian football, and after a sensational 2016-17, Bernardeschi fits the bill for them. Inter will reportedly not meet the midfielder's €70 million (£59 million) release clause, although owners Suning are said to be happy to pay €50 million (£42 million) for the 23-year-old. As noted in the piece, Chelsea are also said to be big admirers of the versatile star, as are Italian champions Juventus . Here is a look at why Bernardeschi is reportedly so coveted by some of Europe's biggest clubs: Although he's always clearly possessed precocious talent, this season the Fiorentina man has really kicked on. He's been the heartbeat of La Viola's attacking play. Bernardeschi has been deployed in various positions on the field, although wherever he picks the ball up, he can threaten the opposition with his passing ability, dribbling skill and turn of pace. Earlier in the campaign, Bleacher Report's Adam Digby noted the Italian is a player happy to put in work off the ball, too: Adam Digby @Adz77 Bernardeschi off, must be tired after shackling Marchisio & creating so much when in possession. Superb display. 1/15/2017, 9:24:37 PM The versatility Bernardeschi possesses would make him an ideal fit for Chelsea boss Antonio Conte. Indeed, there have been times this season when the Fiorentina man has been utilised as a wing-back; for a manager like Conte, who has previously been adaptable in the way he sets his teams up, he'd be a wonderful option. Inter may not be as established as Chelsea or Juventus, but the prospect of being the talisman in the team's renaissance may appeal to Bernardeschi, especially if he's to be handsomely paid. It means Chelsea face a massive fight this summer if they're to get the player to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea Linked with Isco Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images According to Carlos Carpio of Marca , Chelsea have been in talks with Isco's representative over a possible transfer from Real Madrid this summer. The report suggested the Spanish international is \"determined to leave\" the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season, and Manchester City have \"shown the most interest.\" However, the Blues are said to have made contact with the player's agent and father, Paco Alarcon, about a potential switch. Juventus are also said to hold an interest in Isco, although the man himself apparently wants to move to the Premier League \"for both sporting and economic reasons.\" Here's a look at what he would bring to English football: Since moving to Madrid from Malaga in 2013, Isco has struggled to force his way into the Los Blancos side on a regular basis. In big matches, he's frequently on the bench, and as such, he's struggled to find consistency in the iconic all-white jersey. Per OptaJose, when he has been on the field as of late, he's been making a positive impact: OptaJose @OptaJose 5 - Isco Alarcon has had a hand in five goals in his last four starts for Real Madrid in La Liga (three goals and two assists). Honey. https://t.co/omq6Urcax8 2/18/2017, 4:42:20 PM However, Zidane's blueprint in the massive matches is set; Gareth Bale , Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema play as the most advanced men in a 4-3-3 system, meaning there's no spot in the side for Isco to thrive in his best position, as a No. 10. Chelsea haven't been utilising a system with that role either as of late, but it's easy to see Isco thriving as part of the front three alongside the likes of Eden Hazard and Diego Costa. His guile, technical ability and vision would add another dangerous edge to the Blues' attacks.
