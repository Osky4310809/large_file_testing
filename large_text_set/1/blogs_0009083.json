I’ll be the greatest dad.\" \nDuring the course of his transition, he had asked the NHS to freeze his eggs before the process was completed to allow him to have children later in life. \nBut the NHS refused his request, prompting Mr Cross, from Gloucester, to use an anonymous sperm donor to go ahead with his pregnancy. \nAfter giving birth, he says he plans to continue immediately with his transition process to remove his breasts and ovaries. \n\"I faced the prospect of not becoming the man I am supposed to be, physically, or a dad,\" he told The Sun on Sunday. \n\"So I didn’t feel like I had any choice but to have a baby now then get back to transitioning.\" \nBut he admitted the process is difficult and has caused him discomfort. \n\"I found I was pregnant two weeks after the sperm was inserted. \n\"It was mixed emotions. \n\"I was happy but I also knew it would be backtracking on my transition. \n\"It’s like I have given myself one thing, but taken away something else from myself in the meantime. \n\"It is a very female thing to carry a baby and it goes against everything I feel in my body. \n\"I was finally starting to become myself and become a man physically — but now my body is going in the opposite direction. \n\"It makes me angry that I’ve been put through this. \n\"Carrying a baby is meant to be a happy time, but in my body it feels wrong. \n\"I just couldn’t face being years down the line and still waiting to transition so that I can have a kid. \n\"I wanted the kid now so that I can have the transition before I get old. \n\"I want to enjoy being the way I was meant to be.\" \nThe world's first pregnant man was Thomas Beatie, from Arizona in the US. He gave birth in 2008 after commencing hormone treatment to become a man but keeping his reproductive organs.
