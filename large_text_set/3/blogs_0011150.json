The #MBTA had already been talking about about shutting down the #commuterrail for extended periods for repairs. This is quite different. \nThe board wants to cut $49 million from the MBTA’s budget. In addition weekend Commuter Rail service, the board proposed suspending RIDE trips over 1/4 mile, which are not legally required. \nThe proposals were part of what State Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack called a “difficult discussion.” \n“Instead of benefitting the handful of thousands of people who use the system on a typical weekend day, it would benefit all of the riders who use the system on a weekday, which is a much higher number of riders,” Pollack said. “And the savings would be transferred to capital and directly invested back into the Commuter Rail system.” \nNone of the proposals are final, and must still go through the legislative process. \nWBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Karyn Regal reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T04:45:06.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
