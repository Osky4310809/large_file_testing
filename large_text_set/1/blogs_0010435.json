She had a violent confrontation with Chloe Ferry , who reportedly kicked her in the head repeatedly after seeing her holding hands with Marty McKenna. \nPageant star Zahida is officially with fellow EOTB cast mate Sean Pratt - he even got a tattoo of her name of his wrist after they met on the show, and the pair have been described as \"inseparable\" ever since. \nSean Pratt Sean Pratt, who's now dating Zahida Allen (Photo: ITV) Sean Pratt (Photo: Twitter/sean9pratt) (Photo: Twitter/sean9pratt) (Photo: Twitter/sean9pratt) \nSean moonlights as a naked butler when he's not filming and prides himself on his buff body. This summer he got both nipples pierced and started on his calf tattoo - a tribal inking running halfway down his leg. He and Zahida appear frequently on each other's social media accounts - he's nicknamed her Zee Zee and refers to her as his \"little potato head\". \nRoss Worswick Ross Worswick, 26 (Photo: ITV) Ross Worswick (Photo: Twitter/rossworswick) \nRoss has already appeared on Ex On The Beach 1 as Chloe Goodman's ex. He quickly made his way to Vicky Pattison but they split after a short fling in the holiday villa. \nThe 25-year-old also dated TOWIE's Jasmin Walia for two years, splitting from her this summer. \n\"Ross is devastated. He changed his life for her and moved down south,\" a source said at them time. \nZaraLena Jackson ZaraLena Jackson, 24 (Photo: ITV) ZaraLena Jackson (Photo: Twitter/ZaraLena_) (Photo: Twitter/ZaraLena_) \nFashion designer ZaraLena makes her own dresses and has worked as a model and promotions girl in the past. She's currently single and regularly updates her friends with tales of the terrible men who try chatting her up. \nJoshua Ritchie Joshua Ritchie, 21 (Photo: ITV) (Photo: Twitter/ritchie_joshua) (Photo: Twitter/ritchie_joshua) \nJoshua was left embarrassed this summer when footage of him with pregnant Stephanie Davis leaked online and found its way to his family. The short clip shows the ex-Love Island star in bed playing with his manhood while Steph, wearing a pink bra, giggles next to him. \nThe reality star was quick to deny he and Stephanie were in an official relationship, with one source later confirming it was \"just a one night thing\". \n\"Josh spent the night with her and she left in the morning,\" they claimed. \n\"When he saw the video leaked he wasn't happy about it at all.\" \nJust a matter of weeks later, Joshua was spotted snogging former escort Jenny Thompson in the street in Bolton. \nIt now looks like the two met on Ex On The Beach. \nHarriette Harper Harriette Harper, who once dated Pete Wicks off TOWIE (Photo: ITV) Harriette Harper (Photo: Twitter/harriette23xx) (Photo: Twitter/harriette23xx) (Photo: Twitter/harriette23xx) \nNot much is known about glamour model Harriette, other than she's a massive gym bunny and works hard on her beach body. Oh, and she was rumoured to be seeing TOWIE's Pete Wicks before he got with Megan McKenna ... \nAlex Leslie Gym buff Alex Leslie has signed up to the sixth series of EOTB (Photo: ITV) \nMaisie Gillespie Maisie Gillespie, who was recently linked to MIC star Alex Mytton (Photo: ITV) \nMaisie describes herself as a flirt and an attention-seeker - and she also recently scored with Made In Chelsea's Alex Mytton.

Jennifer back in 2012 (Photo: Rex) \nDuring EOTB filming this September, it's thought that she and Geordie Shore's Aaron Chalmers hooked up, as the pair were caught kissing in public on their return to the UK. She was also dating Joshua Ritchie earlier in the summer, though it's not yet known whether they'd broken up by the time they started filming. \nIt may well put a fly in the ointment of Aaron's relationship with Marnie Simpson , who was also reportedly approached by Ex On The Beach producers but refused to go on. \nBecca Edwards https://www.instagram.com/p/BNpRULijXiC/embed \nInternational lingerie model Becca has been a Page 3 girl in the past and loves to show off her body on Instagram. She and Joshua are good friends and regularly see each other outside of Ex On The Beach. While her name hasn't officially been confirmed by MTV, MirrorOnline has heard she'll be joining the cast later on in the series.
