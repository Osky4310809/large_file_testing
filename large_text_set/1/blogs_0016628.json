Instead, they've pushed him right back where he came from. \nAnd that's not so bad either. \nA move that has seemed inevitable finally came to fruition Tuesday. Bautista is re-signing with the Toronto Blue Jays on a deal that, as reported by Steve Phillips for MLB Network Radio, will pay him at least $18 million and perhaps as much as $60 million: Steve Phillips reports Bautista's deal is a 1 year 18 million with mutual options with incentives maxing out at 3 year 60 million #BlueJays — MLB Network Radio (@MLBNetworkRadio) January 17, 2017 \nSince mutual options are rarely ever exercised, however, it's likely this deal will end up costing the Blue Jays just the $18 million guarantee. \nThat's only slightly more than the $17.2 million they would have paid Bautista in 2017 if he'd accepted the club's qualifying offer in November. And to hear Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports say it, the Blue Jays are also getting Bautista back for less than what was available elsewhere. \nFor Bautista himself, who's hit an MLB-high 249 home runs since 2010, $18 million is a raise over the $14 million he earned each year between 2012 and 2016. So, at least there's that. \nAnd thanks to the new collective bargaining agreement, the Blue Jays won't get to make him another qualifying offer if he chooses to test the open waters again after 2017. Without ties to draft-pick compensation, the big payday that eluded Bautista this winter could be out there next winter. Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images \nOf course, draft-pick compensation was just one thing that limited Bautista's marketability this winter. \nAnother was certainly the specter of decline hanging over Bautista's head. He's 36 years old and is coming off a season in which he managed just an .817 OPS and 22 home runs, his worst marks since the days before his big breakout in 2010. He also rated as well below average on defense in right field. \nThere may be no fixing his defense. Even when Bautista was an asset in right field, it had as much to do with his arm as anything else. He admitted early in 2016 that said arm was still compromised from a shoulder injury that cropped up at the end of 2015. \n“It’s using it when you need to, having the history of the injury last year, on an unnecessary throw, there’s more of a conscious effort on my end to just make the necessary throw,” he told Shi Davidi of Sportsnet.ca. Hannah Foslien/Getty Images Kendrys Morales is coming off a .795 OPS and 30 home runs. \nIn an alternate universe, the Blue Jays could ignore this question mark by hiding Bautista at designated hitter. But with newcomer Kendrys Morales locked into that position, that's not happening. \nThe bright side for the Blue Jays to look on is that they could afford to take a defensive hit this winter. Per Baseball Prospectus , they had the American League 's most efficient defense in 2016. Even if they do take a few steps back in 2017, they could still be very good at turning batted balls into outs. \nOf course, less defense might require the Blue Jays to take a step forward (or at least avoid a step backward) on offense. \nFor that, Bautista and Morales will have to make up for what the Blue Jays have lost with Edwin Encarnacion and Michael Saunders signing elsewhere. Saunders leaves a hole the size of an .815 OPS and 24 home runs. Encarnacion leaves a hole the size of an .886 OPS and 42 home runs. \nMorales should handle replacing Saunders' production, so the pressure will be on Bautista to put 2016 behind him and be more like the guy who averaged a .945 OPS and 38 homers per year between 2010 and 2015. \nGuaranteed? Not quite. \nAs ESPN.com's Keith Law expressed in his free agent rankings, the real concern is that Bautista's 2016 drop-off was a case of his age seeping into his bat and slowing it down. Per Baseball Savant , his modest (for him, anyway) .463 slugging percentage against fastballs lends some truth to that. \nBut as far as offseason gambles go, there have been far dumber bets placed than this one. Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images Jose Bautista's core skills remain intact. \nWhile there's no ignoring the various concerns that popped up in Bautista's 2016 season, his core skills remained very much intact. He continued to show a fantastic eye, keeping his walk rate right where it needed to be. He also continued hitting the snot out of the ball on a regular basis, finishing with a career-high 41.0 hard-hit percentage . \nWhich brings us to the ZiPS projections. According to FanGraphs , they expect Bautista to put up an .868 OPS and hit 27 home runs in 2017. Not bad! And possibly conservative, to boot. \nAs such, all of the above is essentially the long way around to saying that the Blue Jays are a better team with Bautista than they are without him. Not drastically better, but better. \nIf nothing else, they're better enough to turn an AL East race that didn't look all that interesting before Tuesday look more interesting. The Boston Red Sox should still be counted among the league's ( surprisingly large ) collection of clear division favorites, but now the Blue Jays have enough weapons to give them a run for their money. \nBautista and Morales alongside Josh Donaldson, Troy Tulowitzki, Russell Martin and Devon Travis is a good lineup. A starting rotation headed by Aaron Sanchez, Marcus Stroman, J.A. Happ and Marco Estrada must be viewed as one of the league's best. In the bullpen, the Blue Jays still have the criminally underrated Roberto Osuna. \nBautista could well be playing in his third postseason with the Blue Jays come October. Once there, he's shown he knows what to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:33:18.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
