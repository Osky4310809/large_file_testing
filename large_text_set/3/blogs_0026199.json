Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr is among those who seem to maximize the scheme, having rested his key players on some stretches of the long NBA season. ADVERTISEMENT On Wednesday, the reigning NBA Coach of the Year suggested that the regular season be cut from 82 games to 75—even at the cost of taking a pay cut. “I wouldn’t be opposed to it, even at the expense to my own salary, but it’s something that everyone would have to agree to,” he told ESPN. “I think even just going down to 75 games, I think that would make a dramatic difference in schedule. Now I don’t see that happening because there is money at stake for everybody.” The issue has become a rough topic over the years, which San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovic popularized to get his aging stars ready for the playoffs. Last week, the defending champions Cleveland Cavaliers sat out their trio of superstars LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Both the Warriors and Spurs also rested their starting units during their previous match-up. Meanwhile, NBA commissioner Adam Silver already released a memo to team owners regarding resting healthy players, calling it “an extremely significant issue for our league.” Khristian Ibarrola /RA RELATED STORY:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T10:24:07.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
