'Bad' move \nOn Friday, Mr Izetbegovic said the appeal would be submitted by Bosnia-Herzegovina's legal representative. \n\"Everyone needs the truth, even those who oppose it, a truth that will be written by international judges, experienced and impartial,\" he said. \nBut Bosnian Serb officials said such a move could not be made without consensus within the country's presidency, where a Bosnian Serb and a Bosnian Croat take the other two seats. \nBosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik also urged ethnic Serb politicians to challenge the legitimacy of any appeal. \nIn Serbia, Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic described Mr Izetbegovic's announcement as \"bad\" for relations between the two countries. \nPoliticians from Bosnia's two semi-independent entities - the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska - have often clashed, triggering political crises. \nThe powers of the central government in the capital Sarajevo are very limited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:38:31.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
