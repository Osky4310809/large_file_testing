Let’s see if the big dog’s price for this little Brazilian cat might still be just right.\nAdvertisement \n\nOkay I get it, you all thought yesterday’s Faux-rrari 19993 Chevy C/K Pickup was ugly as sin. You can stop now with the kill it with fire memes and eyes-getting-plucked-out gifs. Opinion noted.\nBeauty, or the lack thereof, apparently has a financial component as well. I guess that’s not that surprising seeing just how poor-fitting most clothes from Walmart typically are, and in this case the fuglies resulted in a massive 86% Crack Pipe loss.\n\nOkay, if aesthetics are your cup of tea then consider, if you will, the beautiful bodies of Brazil. No, I don’t mean the chiseled physiques in skimpy swimwear that typically covers the country’s miles of white sand beaches, I mean those like this 1981 Puma GTI coupé .\nAdvertisement \n\nPuma was a small Brazilian car manufacturer founded in 1964 by Rino Malzoni, a lawyer who had gained a certain amount of notoriety racing DKWs. Malzoni developed a competition car based on DKW’s three-cylinder two stroke which became the DKW-Malzoni GT. In 1967 Volkswagen took over DKW-Vemag, and put an end to Brazilian DKW production, and hence the DKW-Malzoni.\n\nBy then however, the Malzoni GT had already been renamed the Puma and with no more DKW engines, the cars were redesigned around VW’s Karmann Ghia platform (and later Brazillia.) This resulted in a series of cars that included the one you see right here. In addition to building entire cars for the Brazil market—where tariffs made imports far too expensive—Puma also built thousands of component car kits, many of which made their way to the U.S. and Canada. These came without a drivetrain, front end, or wheels, which the owner would add themselves and then be off to the races.\n\nThis GTI evidences the first major restyling of the Puma, which included replacement of the chrome blade bumpers with molded-in units reminiscent of those of a Porsche 911. The rear end also received the Brazillia’s rigged tail lamp units in place of the earlier VW Bus lights.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:56:03.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
