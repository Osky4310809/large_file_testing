According to BBC Sport , the former Liverpool man took to social media after the match to address the problem, posting the following message: \"Is it normal that Bastia supporters make monkey noises for the whole game and nobody from the 'discipline commission' says anything? \"So is racism legal in France? Or only in Bastia? Football is an amazing sport, but people like Bastia supporters make it horrible. Truly a disgrace.\" VALERY HACHE/Getty Images Bastia used video footage to catch one fan making monkey gestures and promptly banned the individual. Per the report, the club were also given a suspended one-point deduction in Ligue 1. The racial abuse wasn't the only reason Bastia were punished, as the fans also used pyrotechnic devices. Balotelli is all too familiar with racist chants, which was a recurring problem for the Italian during his time in Serie A, per Paolo Bandini of the Guardian . The 26-year-old is in the midst of his first season with Nice, where he's hoping to rebuild his career after failed stints with Liverpool and AC Milan. VALERY HACHE/Getty Images The lifelong Rossoneri fan returned to the Italian fashion capital on loan in the 2015-16 season, but just as the year before, he failed to make an impact. His spell in France has been more productive, as he's scoring freely and Nice sit near the top of the standings. Controversy has followed Super Mario, however, as he's been sent off three times already. His latest sending off came on Saturday against Lorient, resulting in a one-match ban, with a suspended second match added, per Football Italia .
