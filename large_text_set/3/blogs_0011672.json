I’ve got nothing to say, mate,” Snoop Dogg says in the video, before offering a sly grin. A post shared by snoopdogg (@snoopdogg) on Mar 15, 2017 at 3:52pm PDT \nSnoop has been active on social media but has yet to directly respond to the president, who took a shot at his “failing career.” \n“Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!” President Trump tweeted about the visual for the remix of BADBADNOTGOOD’s “Lavender.” \nIn the Jesse Wellens -directed music video, a clown by the name of Ronald Klump is shot by Snoop, though the gunshot is accompanied by a “BANG” flag and the character is later shown to be unharmed. \nBefore the controversy reached its current levels, Snoop told Billboard in an article from March 12, “I feel like it’s a lot of people making cool records, having fun, partying, but nobody’s dealing with the real issue with this fucking clown as president, and the shit that we dealing with out here, so I wanted to take time out to push pause on a party record and make one of these records for the time being.” \nWhile Snoop didn’t have too much to say after Trump and his Twitter fingers got directly involved, a handful of celebrities, including Bow Wow and T.I. , have come to the rapper’s defense with some incredibly outspoken responses. \nDespite this week’s controversy, Snoop appears to be South By Southwest chillin’, even taking in a Desiigner set.
