We’re told the LGBT concerns were not even mentioned.” \nA representative for Holliday reportedly told TMZ that “both death threats and the LGBT reaction were factors in her decision.” \nThe report didn’t give any details on who had threatened the singer.   \nIt said that according to her representative, her “primary concern was the safety of her family.” \nBefore backing out, Holliday was targeted for boycott by angry Trump opponents, with some calling her an “Uncle Tom” and others suggesting that she should commit suicide. \n“It just really made my heart drop to my feet,” Holliday said. “How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven’t even done anything? I guess it’s not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. … We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore.” \nShe reversed her decision once tension began to mount.
