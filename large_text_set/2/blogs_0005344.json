And also, TWINS!). And we just found out that Beyoncé’s pregnancy announcement has broken an Instagram record — officially solidifying it as the stuff of legends.\nThat’s right ladies and gents: The baby announcement photo has more likes than any other post in Instagram history . How many likes might that be, you ask? It currently, as of 8:30 a.m EST, is coming in at almost eight million . This means it’s far surpassed the previous record holder — AKA that photo of Selena Gomez sipping a coke from June 2016, which garnered 6.3 million likes (we don’t claim to understand the mysteries of the internet…we just report on it).\nAnd, in case you somehow missed the photo from yesterday, because, we don’t know, you’ve been living in a cave, and you lost the cave’s wifi password, here it is in all its Bey Baby Bump glory:\nWe would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters \nA photo posted by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST \nWe be like this right now:[header] via GIPHY  \nThe photo had 6.3 million likes within the first eight hours of being posted Wednesday, and currently has over 380,000 comments.\n\nMembers of Beyoncé’s family have also publicly commented on the blessed news, like this adorable message from mom Tina Knowles.\n[hginstagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BP-scFvDCB8/?taken-by=mstinalawson]\n[header]“WOW I don’t have to keep the secret anymore I am soooo happy,” she wrote. \nAnd seriously, what a secret this was. ALSO, Queen Bey has released a few more photos for us to feast our eyes on. And yes, we’re losing it.\nMother Goddess.
