The Banff Pavilion was finished in 1913, but due to frequent flooding in the area, it was demolished in the late 1930s. Now, the Frank Lloyd Wright Revival Initiative wants to bring it back, as Dezeen reports. \nLed by filmmaker Michael Miner, who has covered the renowned architect’s work extensively, the volunteer organization is devoted to promoting Wright’s work, in part by rebuilding designs of his that were demolished. The Banff Pavilion will be its pilot project. \nPeter and Catharine Whyte via Wikimedia Commons // Public Domain \nIdeally, the organization wants to rebuild demolished Wright buildings on their original sites, choosing designs that are particularly exemplary of the architect’s unique style. The Banff Pavilion was one of Wright’s only completed projects in Canada, and a prime example of his famous Prairie style. The project has gotten preliminary approval from the local city council, and will be built entirely with donated materials and funds. \nIf the Banff Pavilion is successful, Miner tells Architect magazine that he hopes to move on to adding to Wright’s Pilgrim Congregational Church in California, which was only partially completed during the architect's lifetime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:04:37.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
