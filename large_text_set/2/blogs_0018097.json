White and responsible for the orchestral pomp of Natalie Prass’ incredible debut album . You can hear the Spacebomb players’ signature sonic heft behind Wallace’s folk-soul compositions, which reach out towards the stars yet are distinctly of this earth, sounding like your feet sinking into the soil and crossing through into the cosmos. There’s a lot to dig into on this thing, from rumbling psychedelia to seismic Americana, yet it’s uniquely approachable through the sheer pleasantness of the arrangements. We premiered the spectral single “ Creation // Someday ” and its video last month, and now we present the entire album ahead of its official release this Friday. Listen below. \n<a href=\"http://skywayman.bandcamp.com/album/seen-comin-from-a-mighty-eye\">Seen Comin&#39; From a Mighty Eye by Skyway Man</a> \nSeen Comin’ From A Mighty Eye is out 2/24.
