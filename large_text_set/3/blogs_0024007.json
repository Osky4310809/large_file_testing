PUBLISHED: 13:06, Fri, Mar 24, 2017 | UPDATED: 16:37, Fri, Mar 24, 2017 \nOrdinary voters who had gathered to listen to two top European figures speak in Rome gave a less than confidence-inspiring verdict when unexpectedly quizzed on their own opinions. \nThe toe-curling moment was captured on camera at a presentation by Malta prime minister Joseph Muscat and top eurocrat Federica Mogherini to kick-start this weekend’s crucial summit in the Italian capital. \nIt began with the pair speaking openly about the challenges facing Europe, including Brexit, but also strongly insisting that the bloc had the capability to emerged from a dark period stronger.

Could you please raise your hands and tell us whether you feel that your voice in Europe is heard sufficiently? Who feels that your voice is being heard in Europe?” \nThe self-avowed EU supporter could not contain his surprise - apparently at the lack of reaction from the public - as he glanced around the room, pulling a disbelieving face. EbS Moderator Antonio Di Bella looked surprised by the lack of response EbS Only a smattering of the audience raised their hands \nGiving a nervous laugh, he pressed on: “Some feel that it is being heard, your voice. Then you also have, do you think that the EU will offer a solution to the major questions that will influence the future of our continent?” \nAt this point the camera panned out onto the crowd indicating, embarrassingly, that more people may have raised their hands to answer no rather than yes. \nAnd only a smattering of people got involved at all, with most sitting in stony silence and refusing to participate in the public litmus test of support for the project. \nMr Di Bella then swiftly moved on, after chuckling: “I see that there are more or less abstentions, so we can maybe bring them over to our own side and convince them.” These are the most eurosceptic countries Fri, February 24, 2017 Play slideshow 1 of 8 \nDuring the debate the trio discussed how the European Union can progress and win back citizens’ trust after Brexit despite facing a multitude of crises from migration to the eurozone. \nMr Muscat said that Britain and the EU would still remain incredibly close even after the UK leaves the bloc, saying the reaction to the terror attack in London shows how the continent is intertwined. \nHe said: “I feel that what happened in London and the global reaction especially the European reaction proves that there can’t be Brexit in terms of solidarity. \n“Whatever may happen between countries and institutions in the forthcoming months there is an insoluble bond and unity which links European citizens. \n“This is a clear proof of the fact that Europe has a dimension which is prouder than the one represented by politicians.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:48:36.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
