The treatment is really fresh for a Bollywood film. Although we have seen a lot of Hollywood films on clumsy women turning into a bravehearts towards the end, this could be a first for Bollywood. And it seems Sonakshi is really happy to do the film. That’s because she seemed so happy that she couldn’t stop giggling and screaming on stage. We have a video of the actress expressing her excitement for the film by yelling and twirling on stage. Everyone was left amused at the actress’ cute outburst. (Also read: Sonakshi Sinha opens up about stepping into the shoes of a journalist and reading disturbing stories about herself at the Noor trailer launch – watch video ) \nThe footage has Sonakshi on stage along with the director Sunhil Sippy and the cast of the film. The actress was in a really good mood. When the anchor asked how she was feeling, Sonakshi first thanked everyone for coming to the trailer launch and then all of a sudden, she broke into this twirling motion, screaming along with it. We feel this is perhaps the most adorable way to show people how much in love with the film you are. Noor looks like a film that you can take an instant liking to. Check out the video right here to know what we are saying… \nHere’s the complete video of the event. \nThe trailer of Noor shows Sonakshi Sinha’s character, who is a journalist, not being happy with her life. She is single, has a group of friends she hangs out with, a job where she is forced to interview Sunny Leone when she clearly wants to cover some other issues, a date whom she likes. So far so good, but the film suddenly takes a U-turn and becomes an investigative one. Also the revisited version of Gulabi Aankhein is played in the background which might become popular since Bollywood is obsessed with recreating old songs rather than coming up with original scores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:39:30.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
