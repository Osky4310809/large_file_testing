Grant Leadbitter opens the scoring (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) 1. Alvaro Negredo scored from another FA Cup keeper calamity \nSheff Wed keeper Joe Wildsmith had a nightmare. \nHe got into a muddle with left back Daniel Pudil, faffing with the ball deep in the box. Wildsmith played the ball out wide, Pudil stroked it back into his six yard box. \nNegredo pounced to deflect Wildsmith's clearance in from three yards out. He'll not get an easier goal all season, but was sharp and alert to exploit the danger. \nThe cock-up wasn't quite as bad as Ali Al-Habsi's error against Man U on Saturday. Daniel Ayala was sent off for Boro (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) 2. Can Aitor Karanka produce goals and excitement as well as solidity? \nBoro have a reputation for hard-ball defence, and a well organised system. That has got them up to a place of safety in the Premier League. \nThe only frustration has been their inability to rack up goals and action in attack on a consistent basis. \nKaranka is after new attacking recruits adding to new boy Rudy Gestede. \nBut it took a trusty midfielder, Grant Leadbitter to grab Boro's goal with a 25 yard free kick.

Daniel Ayala sent off for bad tackle \nThe Spanish defender launched himself at Fernando Forestieri just a minute after Boro took the lead. \nThe Sheffield star had knocked the ball in behind the defence and was sprinting into a dangerous position. \nAyala ignored the ball and deliberately crashed into his opponent. It would not have looked out of place on a rugby field.

Marten de Roon and Fernando Forestieri battle for possession (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) 5. Is the fuss about Adama Traore justified? \nThe Boro winger is one of the fastest players in the country, hitting 25mph on his dribbles. \nBur he frustrates Karanka who has held him back and spent many and hour showing him his mistakes and demanding more team discipline. \nThe former Barca star got a start here, wide on the left. He was well shackled. He had one good shot well blocked in the first half, a speedy break away and pass, but also annoyingly gave the ball away. \nTraore is loved by the Boro fans. He just has to convince Karanka he is worth more game time, especially when used as a counter attacker in away games.
