The couple, who got engaged in April 2014 before tying the knot in Venice, Italy on September 27 of that year, 'feel like they’ve hit the family jackpot' in light of the big news, the source told the magazine. 'When George and Amal found out it was twins they were surprised,' the source said, 'but also a little scared because they both had said that one was enough. 'But the news that it was a boy and a girl made them both really happy ... they can’t believe in just a few months, they’re going to have two babies.' The Up in the Air star, long considered one of Hollywood's most-eligible bachelors, has done a virtual 180 in his attitude toward parenthood, the source told the outlet.
