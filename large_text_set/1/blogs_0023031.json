Smith and Debbonaire’s job as whips is to ensure the party’s MPs vote as the leadership demands. \nThe shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner has also said he will not vote in line with Corbyn’s instructions. Zeichner said he expected to be sacked from the transport role for defying the order. \nTulip Siddiq resigned as a shadow education minister on Thursday, saying she would be better able to fight against a “hard Brexit” from the backbenches. \nSmith, the MP for Withington, told the Manchester Evening News : “My constituents voted strongly for remain and I think it’s important to represent their view. I am not convinced that the government has a proper plan for negotiating a deal in the UK’s best interest, and I also think any deal should go back to the country.” \nDebbonaire, MP for Bristol West, which returned a remain vote of nearly 80% last June, told the Bristol Post : “I have always said that I would be minded to vote against article 50 if it meant leaving the single market or something close to it. And Theresa May has indicated that that is what she wants to do, so I’m minded to vote against.” \nShe told the newspaper she understood why Corbyn and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, had called for the party to back the triggering of article 50, but said it was not “in the best interests” of Bristol. \n“The 25 most leave constituencies and the 25 most remain constituencies are represented by Labour MPs and mine was one of those remainers,” she said. “I need to be mindful of their views but most importantly I’m doing this for the jobs, the industries and knowledge-creation sector that we have in Bristol West in particular. \n“The engineering companies, the creative industries and the universities – they have got in touch, in different ways, to tell me they need to be as fully in the single market as possible.” \nZeichner, whose Cambridge constituency also voted for remain, said it had been a “very straightforward decision”. \n“It’s my strongly held personal position, and I represent three-quarters of the people of Cambridge,” he told the Cambridge News. “I’ve had perfectly civilised conversations [with the Labour leadership]. They know my position and they understand exactly why I’m doing what I’m doing, and it’s for them to decide what to do next.” \nThe shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, defended Corbyn’s stance. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “You have to remember how this looks to people in post-industrial Britain, former mining areas, the north, the Midlands, south Wales – it would look as if elites were refusing to listen to them. \n“It would be wrong. How could MPs vote for a referendum and then turn around and say: it went the wrong way so we are ignoring it?” \nCorbyn, who during his time as a backbencher defied the party whip hundreds of times, has said he understands the pressures facing his MPs, many of whom strongly supported the remain cause, but he has urged the party to unite and make sure the legislation goes through the Commons. \nHe said: “Labour is in the almost unique position of having MPs representing constituencies in both directions, and very strongly in both directions. I say to everyone: unite around the important issues of jobs, security, economy, rights, justice, those issues, and we will frame that relationship with Europe in the future outside the EU, but in concert with friends, whether those countries are outside or inside the EU.” \nSiddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn in north London, said she had to represent the views of her constituents, who voted overwhelmingly to remain. \n“I have always been clear, I do not represent Westminster in Hampstead and Kilburn, I represent Hampstead and Kilburn in Westminster,” she said in her resignation letter. \nThe shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, who has previously said Theresa May’s plans for Brexit were not in the best interests of his constituents or the country, said he would toe the party line. \n“I have been clear throughout that I respect the result of the referendum and will, therefore, join my colleagues in voting for the bill on its second reading,” he said. “However, Theresa May does not have a mandate to dictate the terms of Brexit without listening to the British people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T11:21:22.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
