I’m impressed by the composure he showed on his first day of training. Right now he’s just training with us. We’ll make a decision in due time.” \nHowever, Xie Hui, an assistant coach at the club, recently issued an ambiguously-worded message on his Weibo account saying: “Ricardo Carvalho, it’s a honor to have you on our side.” \nOscar scores on Shanghai SIPG debut \nThe 38-year-old was part of the Portugal squad that was successful in Euro 2016 last summer - the latest honour in a trophy-laden career for the centre-back. \nCarvalho won three Primeira Liga titles and one Champions League crown with Porto before switching to Chelsea, playing a key part in them claiming three Premier League titles and three FA Cups. \nHe left Stamford Bridge after six years to join Real and lifted the Liga title with Los Blancos during the 2011-12 season before joining Monaco in 2013. \nShanghai SIPG are one of Chinese football's star attractions, having also signed Hulk from Zenit for a then-Asian record £46.1m before smashing that mark when securing Oscar.
