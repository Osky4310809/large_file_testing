So violent was the contact that it completely ripped the radiator out of Gordon’s car, which spun helplessly after the impact. \nAnd Gordon would later call the crash “probably the hardest I’ve ever hit … I couldn’t have hit the wall at a worse angle — it really tore the thing up.” \nThe good news is that Gordon wasn’t seriously injured and the crash helped lead NASCAR and the tracks to add additional SAFER barriers in unprotected areas, a work in progress for years to follow. \nStill, it was a scary moment for one of NASCAR’s all-time greats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:08:24.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
