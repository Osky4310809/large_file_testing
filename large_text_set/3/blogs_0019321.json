It’s not your traditional venue,” said Jordan Bishop, spokesman for Denver Arts & Venues. “We’re constantly looking at ways to improve the customer experience out there.” \nMaking it happen, though, posed a bit of a logistical challenge for Gallery , a Greenwood Village-based maker of food carts and kiosks. \nThat’s where the crane came in. \n“At Red Rocks, you have to walk all the way up to that upper plaza. If we could find a solution to get some offerings down to the lower bleacher seats that would be great — that’s how the idea got birthed,” said Dan Gallery V, president of the family-owned business. “We just needed to get a crane involved and some winch-and-pulley systems.” \nOn Tuesday, crews from Gallery used both to lower about 65 pieces of new food-service equipment into place in the natural amphitheater. \nIn locations where there was enough room to maneuver, they used the crane. In others, they set up a winch-and-pulley system and lowered the pieces in. \nGallery, which recently changed its name from Carts of Colorado, has been making food carts and kiosks for more than 30 years. It was born out of a Chicago-style deli in Denver that grew into a larger catering-style business in need of something more sophisticated than your run-of-the-mill hotdog cart. \n“Think about a New York City street corner where someone is selling hotdogs. The volume of people isn’t as extensive as it would be at a venue like Red Rocks,” Gallery said. “In order to better satisfy the larger crowds, the carts had to be redesigned to basically mirror your kitchen.” \nGallery designers began working with Denver Arts & Venues in early 2016 on the new Red Rocks carts, which replace a fleet that were first installed 20 years ago, he said. Locally, Gallery carts can also be found at Coors Field and Pepsi Center. \nAt Red Rocks, the wood-paneled carts were designed withstand the elements and better blend in with the amphitheater’s aesthetics, Gallery said. \nFlexibility was also important — the carts’ design will allow the concessionaire to change up the food menu if need be and each location will have draft beer and cocktail capabilities, too. \n“As a patron, you’re no longer going to multiple lines to get a burrito in one line and a cocktail in another,” Gallery said. “The less time in line, the more time enjoying the event — that’s the key.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:42:39.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
