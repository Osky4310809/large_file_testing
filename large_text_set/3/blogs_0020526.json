That same day, several disturbing social media posts were found on their accounts, including Elizabeth referring to herself as a \"wife\" on Instagram. \n\"That's very disturbing with when you put that together,\" Thomas said. \nJosh DeVine, a spokesman for the TBI, told NBC News that authorities believe Elizabeth's abduction was pre-planned.

Tennessee Bureau of Investigation \n\"The more we're learning about him and the more we're learning about this situation indicates that he pre-planned this,\" DeVine said. \"That he groomed this young girl for all of this.\" \n\"All sorts of things are going through my head, all sorts of possibilities,\" Thomas said. \"I don't know where she is.\" \nCummins began teaching at Culleoka Unit School in 2011, according to school records obtained by NBC News. \nHe taught Thomas' freshman forensics class, records show. \nIn January, a student reported seeing Cummins kissing Elizabeth on the lips, according to records. The two denied the incident, the records show, but Elizabeth was then barred from his classroom after a teacher said it appeared they were spending too much time together.

Elizabeth Thomas Tennessee Bureau of Investigation \nAuthorities on Monday released the last-known picture of Elizabeth, taken shortly before her alleged kidnapping and surveillance footage of Cummins at a WalMart in Columbia just days before their disappearance. \nThe video appears to show Cummins in a beauty products section of the store containing women's hair dye, in one portion of the video a box appearing to show a hair coloring kit can be seen in his shopping cart. \nThe TBI said in their press release Tuesday evening that they determined the purchase was not connected to any plan to change his appearance or Elizabeth's. \nThe school district in Maury County has terminated Cummins' employment in the wake of the ongoing investigation into alleged inappropriate contact he had with Elizabeth in January, the TBI said. \nDespite more than 650 leads, the TBI said Tuesday they still lack any new confirmed sightings, and believe Cummins could be keeping Elizabeth out of the public eye, or have fled Tennessee altogether.

In his view, that meant Cummins' convinced his sister to do something she knew was wrong. \nThe girl's father also said he believed Cummins was grooming the children in his class — telling them lies such as that he had previously worked for the FBI and CIA. \n\"He had lied to all these kids,\" he said. \"I told them it couldn't possibly be true.\" \nAnthony Thomas added that his daughter told him Cummins claimed to have millions of dollars and multiple pieces of property. \nDespite his heartbreak, Thomas said he would never lose hope of seeing Elizabeth back safe and home. \n\"You've always got to hang on to some hope,\" he said. \n\"I'll wait all my life if I have to.\" Tammy Leitner", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:41:06.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
