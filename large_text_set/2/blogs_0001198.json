The e-mail was sent at 9:07 p.m. on Dec. 24.\nFederal authorities in Denver said they were unable to discuss the e-mail or what happened after it was received.\nGillian Christensen, acting press secretary for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, issued a statement that said, “DHS did receive the e-mail in question from a community member in Denver. It was immediately referred to the appropriate law enforcement agencies for review.”\nRelated Articles February 2, 2017 Denver mosque leaders feared RTD shooting suspect had radicalized, reported him to Homeland Security February 1, 2017 Man accused of shooting RTD guard at Union Station was former soldier who posted about police, Islam February 1, 2017 Denver police say suspect shot RTD security officer while he was talking to two women near Union Station Cummings has not been formally charged in the shooting death of Scott Von Lanken. He is being held without bond in Denver’s Downtown Detention Center for investigation of first-degree murder, and he is scheduled to appear Friday morning in district court.\nPolice have said that Cummings approached Von Lanken, 56, outside Denver Union Station as he was giving directions to two women. The suspect pointed a gun at Von Lanken’s neck and told him to follow directions, and he then pulled the trigger.\nVon Lanken, who died on the way to a hospital, was a former police officer in Wisconsin and a church pastor in Loveland.

Texas criminal records show Cummings was convicted in November 2010 of disorderly conduct. The conviction was dismissed after he received a deferred sentence, according to Travis County court records. He does not have prior arrests in Colorado.\nCummings, a former Army sergeant, increasingly had shown signs of radicalization.\nThe e-mail from mosque leaders describes a white man from Pampa, Texas, who acted paranoid and openly called for a fight to instill Sharia law in the United States.\nCummings recently had come to Denver from Pampa, where he ran a Brazilian-style jiu-jitsu studio. It is unclear when he moved or why.\nHe had been living at the Holiday Motel in Englewood with a woman and a young child. Cummings’ social media posts indicate he is married and that his wife also practices Islam.\nThe motel manager said Cummings first stayed there in the fall but left after a month. He returned around the New Year.\nThe manager, who spoke to The Denver Post on the condition that his name not be published, said Cummings was a no-problem tenant, who sometimes helped other renters pay their weekly fees.\n“He tried to keep his good deeds on the down-low,” the manager said. “I never had any thoughts that he was violent or anything like that.”\nBack home in Texas, Cummings had been drawing attention to himself as his opinions about Islam grew stronger, according to several people who knew him.\nMaggie Johnson, a reporter for the Pampa News, said Cummings started writing martial arts stories for the newspaper in 2015, but his ties to the newspaper were severed when he became obsessive about bullying and conspiracy theories at the local high school.\n“He wrote guest pieces.
