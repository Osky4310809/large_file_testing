Image copyright Emma Smith Image caption The Northern Lights were visible from Gairloch \nIt was the first time since October last year that AuroraWatch UK had issued a red alert. \nDisplays of the aurora are related to activity on the sun. \nAmong those to photograph Monday night's displays were Emma Smith from Gairloch and members of Caithness Astronomy Group, including Karen Munro. \nThe group travelled to Tongue and Coldbackie in Sutherland to get clear enough skies to watch the Northern Lights.
