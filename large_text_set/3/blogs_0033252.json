Enter ruggedly handsome Nashville star Charles Esten , cast as Carl Hardee Sr., who storms into Carl's Jr. headquarters to take back what he founded years ago from his son, Carl Hardee Jr. \nThe office is overrun with, you guessed it, bikinis, Jacuzzi's, a mechanical bull and general debauchery. But thanks to Carl Hardee Sr., not for long! So what gives? Photos Carl's Jr \nCarl's Jr is revamping with the new tagline, \"Pioneers of the great American burger.\" \nNo longer will foodies see celebs like Kate Upton , Audrina Patridge , Emily Ratajkowski , Heidi Klum , Padma Lakshmi , Hayden Panettiere , Nina Agdal and Charlotte McKinney wearing next-to nothing and chowing down in their ads. \nInstead, expect far less skin and way more close-ups on fresh ingredients. \nWatch the entire ad in the video above, and tell us in the comments, are you ready for Carl's Jr. to make the change?!
