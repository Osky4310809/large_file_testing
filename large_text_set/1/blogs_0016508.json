Today Twitter turned off sharing, Liking, commenting, and Revining in Vine , and released its succesor Vine Camera as an app update on iOS and Android . It’s also discontinued the Vine Windows Phone app. \nFor now you can still open the old Vine app if you don’t update, where you can view your old feed and profile, and download your videos . But Twitter confirms to me that eventually if you don’t update to Vine Camera, the app will stop working and you won’t have any functionality. \nThere’s not much of a walkthrough to give for Vine Camera. It’s basically just the camera screen of the old app with no social network attached. The grid, focus lock, ghost line-up, and flash tools are still there. But you’ll no longer be able to use the Vine Soundboard, Snap-To-Beat, or Featured Track soundtracking tools. \nOnce you shoot a video, a sharing screen appears with options to save to your camera roll and post to Twitter turned on by default. You can add a caption or change which Twitter account you share from, but that’s it. \nAs we reported earlier today, Twitter will now loop all videos under 6.5 seconds , whether they’re from Vine or elsewhere. \nNow the question is whether Twitter plans to put any additional development work into Vine Camera to keep it relevant with other photo and video apps like Instagram and Snapchat, or whether it will allow it to just fade from memory. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:13:51.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
