Israel is the nation that is the target of specific agenda items. \nAccording to the sources, Haley and other senior administration officials are committed to boycotting the human rights council until it ceases to be an organ to attack Israel, at which point the U.S. might rejoin the group. \n“The argument that the U.S. has to participate in bodies like the United Nations Human Rights Council or risk losing our influence over it is ridiculous,” one senior administration official told the Free Beacon. “The UNHRC is, like its predecessor, morally bankrupt and the only good news is that its actions have little practical effect in the real world. We’ve wasted enough time and money on it.” \nThe resolve of the new administration to strike a chord of loyalty to Israel, is in direct opposition to the signals sent by the previous Obama administration in its dying weeks as it actively worked towards the promulgation and acceptance of an anti-Israel resolution, actions that both shocked and outraged Israel — and then Trump, who indicated on social media that it wouldn’t happen again after his inauguration. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has also reiterated the administration’s loss of patience with UNHCR and its desire to disengage from the organization until it no longer serves as a vehicle of anti-Israeli rhetoric.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:07:37.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
