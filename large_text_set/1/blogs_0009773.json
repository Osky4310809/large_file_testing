Wind Waker HD and Majora's Mask 3D did get small bonuses in the form of cheap figurines, but it looks like Nintendo is finally going to give us the proper collector's treatment with the \"Special\" edition and \"Master\" edition.\nThe only difference between these two versions is that the \"Master\" version comes with a statue of the Master sword. Otherwise, you'll be snagging a soundtrack, a carrying case for the console, a weather worn map, a coin, and a special game case. I can't imagine this would retail for under $100 USD, but there aren't any other details apart from confirmation of this package. There is also no mention of any other regions getting this, but since the Switch is region free, this won't be as big of an issue as previously.\nWhile I'm not entirely sure I want a Switch, I am a huge Zelda fan, so I'm probably going to end up with this version well before I actually get the console. Such is the life of a die-hard fan who should probably spend his money on wiser things. Then again, if Nintendo screws the pooch like with the Hyrule Warriors collector's edition nonsense, then maybe I won't be spending money on this.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T11:08:34.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
