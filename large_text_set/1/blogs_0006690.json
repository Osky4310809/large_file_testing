(Jonathan Devich) Skip Ad The number of UCI-registered continental teams in the US will remain at 10 this season, with three new squads stepping in for the now-defunct teams Jamis, Astellas and Lupus. The U23 team led by former SmartStop director Mike Creed is registered under the name Aevolo, as Cyclingnews reported last year . New U23 national cyclo-cross champion Lance Haidet and runner-up Gage Hecht are amongst the team's riders. Canyon Bicycles, a new team out of Utah , made the cut, too, with former WorldTour rider Chad Beyer, and former U23 national champion Rob Squire. \nCCB Velotooler is the third new team, another developmental squad that grew out of the New England CCB club . \nThe merged Elevate-KHS Pro Cycling squad, which Cyclingnews reported on last year, is the only other team to change for 2017. \nThe Rally Cycling roster was already confirmed in November, with junior world time trial champion Brandon McNulty the hot new signing. Holowesko-Citadel added four new riders for this season, while Axeon Hagens Berman added eight riders but keeps top-performers Adrien Costa, Logan Owen and Neilson Powless. \nSerghei Tvetcov returns stateside with Jelly Belly-Maxxis, and Australian Cameron Wurf returns to the pro peloton after quitting in 2014 when Cannondale merged with Garmin. He signed with Cylance Pro Cycling , and will ride alongside former US champion Eric Marcotte and the evergreen Karl Menzies under the direction of Hilton Clarke. \nSimon Pellaud from IAM Cycling joins Team Illuminate , and will ride alongside Colombian sprinter Edwin Avila. \nAxeon Hagens Berman", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T04:43:03.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
