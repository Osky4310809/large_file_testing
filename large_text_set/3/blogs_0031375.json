A strong, independent country needs control of its own laws. That process starts now. \n\"Converting EU law into UK law, and ending the supremacy of lawmakers in Brussels, is an important step in giving businesses, workers and consumers the certainty they need. \n\"And it will mean that as we seek a comprehensive new economic partnership with the EU, our allies will know that we start from a position where we have the same standards and rules.\" Read More Theresa May's Brexit letter in full: Text of Article 50 letter to Donald Tusk \nIn Mrs May's letter to Mr Tusk, she set out how it was \"necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU\". \nMrs Merkel gave a frosty reception to the PM's plea, saying talks must first clarify how to unravel the commitments, rights and duties the UK has entered into over its 44-year membership. \n\"It is only if we have sorted that out that we can next - and I hope soon - talk about our future relationship,\" said the German leader. \nMrs May told the BBC's Andrew Neil she wants \"everybody to know\" what the withdrawal arrangements are and the terms of the future relationship by the end of March 2019, but there \"may be a period of implementation\" after the UK leaves the EU. \nAsked if free movement would end within two years, Mrs May replied: \"We want to have the agreements done in two years. There may then be a period when we are implementing those arrangements.\" \nShe added: \"I did campaign for Remain and I did vote to Remain but I also said I didn't think the sky would fall in if we left the European Union and it hasn't.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:27:12.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
