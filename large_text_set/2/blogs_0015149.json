The things they can do - like play the original Doom on their little computer screens. Not that you would play: you'd be driving. You can't drive and play Doom - can you?\nIntroducing Matt Swarthout and a Porsche 911, via Gizmodo . Matt Swarthout has worked out how to, in three easy steps, install and play Doom in his car, mapping the controls to the same controls he'll be using for driving.\nTo move forwards in Doom he drives forwards in real life; to turn left and right in Doom he turns the steering wheel left and right; to change weapon he changes gear; and to shoot he honks the horn - my personal favourite.\nWhat can possibly go wrong?\nMatt Swarthout has tinkered with odd control platforms for games before.

By the end of the video he's hammering the bread-down sliders of three separate toasters as if he were playing whack-a-mole.
