Modra/Sports Imagery/Getty Images Joseph Zucker Featured Columnist March 21, 2017 Marshawn Lynch 's agent, Doug Hendrickson, left the door open for the former running back to return to the NFL . \" He's one of the most unique guys I've ever been with in my life ,\" Hendrickson said Monday, per KNBR's Kevin Jones . \" Marshawn, it wouldn't shock me in three days if he says, 'Hey, I want to play.' It wouldn't shock me if he says, 'Nah, I don't know where this came from. I don't want to play.'\" Hendrickson added that Lynch \" does miss football.\" Lynch retired in February 2016. However, ESPN's Adam Schefter and Josina Anderson reported last Friday the Oakland Raiders were considering adding the 30-year-old. The Seahawks would have to release or trade Lynch since he'd still be under contract with the team for two more years. According to Schefter and Anderson, Lynch has thrown out the possibility of playing again and the opportunity to play for the Raiders—he's an Oakland native—would further sweeten the return. After Latavius Murray signed with the Minnesota Vikings, adding Lynch would address a major need for the Raiders. As of right now, DeAndre Washington and Taiwan Jones are the team's two best running backs. While Oakland shouldn't expect to see the peak \"Beast Mode\" version Lynch in the event he joins the team, he could still be a productive running back in the NFL. Taking a year off could be just what he needed after he led the NFL in carries between 2011 and 2014 (1,181), per Pro Football Reference , and battled injuries in 2015. There's also a recent precedent of a one-time Pro Bowl running back returning to relative success after a yearlong absence. Ricky Williams ran for 3,211 yards 61 games—mostly in a reserve role—for the Miami Dolphins after his brief hiatus in 2004. Targeting Lynch would be a nice stopgap until Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie can figure out a more permanent solution to complement Derek Carr and Oakland's potent passing game.
