The ad also turned out to be mostly false depiction of the entry into the country of Adolphus Busch . \nBut there was also this little gem from Audi pushing the false statistics of gender pay inequality. \n“Women are still paid 21% less than men,” Audi tweeted about their ad. “As a brand that believes in progress, we are committed to equal pay for equal work.” Progress is for everyone. At Audi, we are committed to equal pay for equal work. #DriveProgress pic.twitter.com/pF0t14ido8", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:37:09.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
