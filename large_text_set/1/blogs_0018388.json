The actress turned heads in a striking Elie Saab gown, with a colorful star-patterned bodice and long, black skirt with a thigh-high slit.

As she told ET's Carly Steel on the red carpet, the big, star-studded event was \"kind of a big deal\" for her.\" \"This is my first big premiere [in] L.A.\" Dobrev shared. \"I've never had a premiere at the Chinese theater in my entire career.\" The 28-year-old star called the experience \"surreal,\" adding, \"If you told the 14-year-old version of me when I was not an actor that I would be at a huge Hollywood premiere [at] the Chinese theater, I probably would've told you to screw off because you're lying to me.\" In xXx: Return of Xander Cage , Dobrev stars alongside Vin Diesel, who plays the eponymous action hero . Recently Diesel sat down with James Corden on The Late Late Show , where he auditioned for a chance to catch a ride in Corden's SUV for a future installment of \"Carpool Karaoke.\" RELATED: Vin Diesel Auditions for ‘Carpool Karaoke’ and It's Pretty Awesome For his audition, Diesel chose the classic \"Consider Yourself\" from the musical Oliver! However, Dobrev gave her own audition for the ET cameras right there on the red carpet, and her choice was decidedly more early-1990s: Sir Mix-a-Lot's iconic \"Baby Got Back.\" After watching that, who wouldn't be down with watching Dobrev perform a bevy of 90s classics alongside the charming English host? Dobrev also appeared on The Late Late Show on Thursday, where she participated in a \"Nuzzle Off,\" rubbing her face against a cactus and a llama alongside Corden and guests Chris Hardwick and Guillermo!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T11:30:12.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
