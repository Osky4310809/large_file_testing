Sushma Swaraj-ji wants our book to be the national holy book, and made compulsory reading in all schools. At this rate we’ll become bigger bestsellers than Chetan Bhagat, and get invited to TV chat shows to talk on all and sundry subjects.\nKrishna: With all due respect to Chetanji, and to Sushmaji, I don’t think that our book needs such publicity or political patronage to get people to read it. And as far as making it compulsory in schools goes, the whole point of our book is that there can be no compulsion. All it can do is help you realise your own dharma, which you can chose to follow. If I compel you to follow anything it would be adharmic, not only for you but also for me.\nArjun: Yeah, I see what you mean. Being made to follow someone else’s dharma makes it adharmic for all concerned.\nKrishna: And then there’s this business of proposing to make it the national book. Wouldn’t that be to parochialise our message which is much larger in scope than the limiting boundaries of nationalism?\nArjun: You mean that our book and what it has to say doesn’t belong to this nation, or to any one nation, but to all nations?\nKrishna: That’s exactly what I mean. Our book and its teachings are universal and belong not to any one country, or to any one community, but to all those, without exception, who freely chose to make our book their own.\nArjun: So you could belong to any country, and to any religion, and still subscribe to the teachings of our book?\nKrishna: Exactly. Countries and religions don’t matter. You could be a stateless refugee, and an atheist to boot, and still be inspired by our book and claim it for your own. Indeed, such a person might do so with more honest conviction than those who only pay our book lip-service to further their political agenda.\nArjun: So how can we prevent such self-servers from hijacking our book for their own selfish ends?\nKrishna: That, my comrade-in-arms, is the next Kurukshetra we must face …", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:00:04.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
