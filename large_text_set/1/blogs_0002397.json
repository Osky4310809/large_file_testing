Bush, whose advanced age and declining health will reportedly prevent his attendance, according to Politico . \nIt is expected that President Barack Obama will attend at least part of the inauguration ceremony, as tradition dictates a sort of handing-off of power from the current president to his incoming replacement. \nHowever, it remained unclear at this time whether former President Bill Clinton would attend the ceremony, given the bitter general election campaign waged between Trump and Clinton’s wife, Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton. \nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter to help spread the word that former President George W. Bush will be in attendance at the inauguration of Donald Trump.
