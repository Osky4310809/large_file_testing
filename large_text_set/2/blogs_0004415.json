I was working on the car when it started to rain, so I gathered up the tools and made my way back indoors for a coffee, I thought ‘just check gt4oc on my phone, see whats going on…..hmmmm, where is my phone?’ Well after a bit of a search I realised I had left in under the bonnet of the celica, right under the hinges, screen up! Balls! Quick call to the insurance company (house phone!) and it is off to the menders So please excuse the poor photos, I had to dig out my old digi cam and it seems to have deteriorated over time (I think tech has moved on but I’m in denial!).So progress over the past couple of weeks has included a lot of calculations to confirm my suspension and spring choice, I have ended up ordering BC’s with a 6/4kg/mm spring rate. Here are the excerpts from the suspension thread I had – I could go for stock setup for compliancy, but it will still cost £500 - £550. Coilovers are £600 and I can choose the spring rate I want FOC, so that is the main reason I will be going for them.So my what spring rate should I go for? My initial thoughts are that the vertical stiffness of the car should be as low as possible without bottoming out the dampers under hard cyclic compression. Secondly I would like to reduce the ST205’s tendency to understeer one way or another.Here are the current available systems - Stock springs - Front: ~2.5 kg/mm Rear: ~2.1 kg/mm Ratio of 1.19 stiffer front to rear.Tein uprated springs - Front: 4.3 kg/mm Rear: 3.7 kg/mm Ratio of 1.16 stiffer front to rear.BC Std springs – Front: 8kg/mm Rear: 5kg/mmRatio of 1.6 stiffer front to rearLooking at the numbers, the stock set up is 20% stiffer front to rear, this is directly in line with the weight distribution of the car being 60/40. The Tein setup is 16% stiffer front to rear making the rear of the car stiffer in proportion, hopefully reducing understeer, but as a consequence the vertical stiffness increases making the rear ride bouncy. The BC setup is 60% stiffer front to rear! This theoretically will make the car understeer more than the stock setup and increase the vertical stiffness of the car by 320% at the front, as far as I am concerned this is too much for my requirements. So, I think that I will order 6kg/mm front and 5kg/mm rear, this should maintain the stock 20% front to rear stiffness ratio. Then to reduce inherent understeer without sacrificing supple vertical movement I will re-drill my rear arb to move the connection points inwards, effectively stiffening it up and reducing understeer. Right, I have with a little assistance from one of my colleagues (cheers Ed!) come to a conclusion on the initial springs rates, using some simple mathematics and his experience in setting up different cars for different conditions.The best starting point for choosing springs rates is to work out the natural resonant frequency of the front and rear axles, this can be determined using the sprung and un-sprung masses.Initially the standard suspension was analysed, this is using a UK car and averaging the corner weights, standard springs etc.As you can see they are not matched, resulting in the front and rear of the car reacting in a different manner over the same bump. The aim when setting the car up is to achieve the same frequency front and rear.Now the standard suspension frequency is known I can design the system around it, using the following calculated figures for previous cars Ed has set up – 106 GTI (fast road) - 1.87Hz - Perfect for B roads, wobbly on track205 GTI (Gravel) - 2.0Hz - Very nice setup for real world road use, a bit soft for track and sticky tires205 GTI (Hillclimb) - 2.99Hz - Bit to stiff and jolty on roads, My escort (Mental, was 4age20v now SR20, gotta explain ed!) – 2.4Hz ish - Feels very good on roads, might be slightly soft for hardcore trackingCivic (Britcar) - 3.5Hz - To harsh for fast road use without skipping, could do with being a bit stiffer when stickier slicks were usedLotus 211 (BritishGT) - 4.5Hz - Proper slicks and a bit of down forceMy car as I keep bleeting on about, will be a B road car, set up for fast road use on give and take roads around the midlands and wales. I will be aiming for around 2Hz, to reach a viable spring rate I have gone for 2.05Hz, this equates to 7Kgf/mm front and 4.6Kgf/mm rear.So after going through the calcs here are the results for the other springs and suspension systems available – Stock springs - Front: ~2.5 kgf/mm Rear: ~2.1 kgf/mm Front – 1.34Hz Tein uprated springs - Front: 4.3 kgf/mm Rear: 3.7 kgf/mm Front – 1.63Hz BC Std springs – Front: 8kgf/mm Rear: 5kgf/mmFront – 2.22Hz ST205 Bilstein Coilovers (JohnDGT4’s) – Front: 14kgf/mm Rear: 7kgf/mmFront – 2.94HzRear – 2.55Hz (Assuming standard corner weights, I’m guessing this car has had a little more done to it though!)So, what do you guys think? This is only the first step of course, the dampers need to be tuned to the springs, as do the ARB’s. But I also have plans there too, initially make the stock items adjustable, then possibly do a system like the citroen xsara WRC car! I ended up ordering them from Corby Motorsport, the vendor was a pleasure to deal with, delivery time was spot on considering the custom spring rates, and all in it was £600 They come highly recommended from me So the front end of the car has been stripped of it’s struts, the ball joints were not too bad, I used the big lump hammer to shock the tapers off their seats, took about 40 mins per side to remove. Once side appears to be in very good condition, the other side is in need of a fig8, not too bad though. Both of the upper ball joints need replacements before I fit the new c’overs.Other than that I have been cleaning and tinkering, the strut brace was removed when taking the top mounts out, it is a really nice C-one unit in CNC’d aluminium, but in need of attention due to corrosion setting in on the ally. I attempted to compound it back, only the main bars responded to this, I think they were lacquered from new, all of the associated bracketry has taken a beating and just would not clean up.C-One Strut brace – Condition of brackets – I decided to get them glass bead blasted, the result is stunning and originally I was just going to lacquer at this point, however I have been reading about home anodising, and as they have come out so good I think I should put a little more effort in, learn a new skill, and give it a go!Post blasting – Other than that, a lot of removing components and cleaning (sorry for the blown out picture!) – And I thought I would just pop this here – Looks rather good doesn’t it? Might have to give it a permanent home!I will update over the next few days as I get the coilovers ready to fit, source some spacers for the back end and a set of brake pipes, and fit my new steering wheel Hope you are all well,J", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:06:57.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
