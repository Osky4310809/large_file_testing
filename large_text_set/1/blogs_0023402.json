The dogs and their handlers – all law enforcement officers – came from Phoenix and Washington, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico, and as far away as Guam. \n\"We can't take safety for granted,\" said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, at a formal swearing-in ceremony Wednesday for the new arrivals. \"Quite frankly, no one department in the country has the capabilities to undertake something as high profile as the Super Bowl by themselves.\" \nU.S. Marshal Gary Blankinship, a former Houston police officer, deputized the officers at the Houston Police Officers' Union hall. \nThe canine cops join a unique pack of special deputies that dates back to the earliest days of the republic, when lone marshals called on locals to help them police the burgeoning frontier, said Chief Deputy Marshal Richard Hunter, based in Houston. \nPosses of special deputies helped U.S. Marshals guard prisoners or apprehend dangerous outlaws. Now, they help with an assortment of tasks and events. \n\"You join a long list of bar owners, hotel owners, cattlemen and drunks,\" Hunter joked, as chuckles erupted. \"So congratulations on doing this for us. We appreciate it.\" \nThe pack converged in Houston after a trip, that for some, crossed thousands of miles. \nGuam Airport Police Officer Robert Umadhay, 40, spent seven hours flying from Guam to Hawaii, then another seven hours on a plane to Houston, with his German short-haired pointer, Rex, at his side. \n\"Oh man, it was tough!\" he said, laughing at the hours they spent cooped up on planes. \"But it worked out. ... It's an honor.\" \nIt's the first time his department has helped with Super Bowl protection, he said. \nLos Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Richard Faulk will be working his third Super Bowl, after San Francisco and Phoenix. Eight other LACSO deputies joined him, as did his 6-year-old black Lab, Clyde, who barked and scampered after the ceremony. \n\"He's wound up,\" he said, as his partner waved a red rubber toy at Clyde to calm him down. \nWashington State Patrol Trooper Walter Heilig, 46, said his German short-haired pointer quickly connected with his canine counterparts when Heilig tried to step away from their hotel room. \nHis dog - also named Rex - howled in protest, setting off a chorus of yelps from other rooms. \n\"I don't think I'd want to be a patron staying there if I didn't have a dog,\" he said. \"It sounded like being in a kennel.\" Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.
