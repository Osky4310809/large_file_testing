Earlier we learned that Jamie Chung joined Fox’s X-Men series as Blink. Now it’s being reported that two X-Men sequels are getting new writers. First up, Drew Goddard has taken on the Deadpool 2 script, according to Collider . Originally the David Leitch-directed film was being written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who wrote the wildly successful first film. According to the site, it’s now being taken over by Drew Goddard ( Daredevil , Cabin in the Woods ). Goddard and star Ryan Reyonlds ( Green Lantern ) are reportedly working on it together. \nCollider is also reporting more info on X-Men sequels. According to the site, Joe Carnahan ( The Grey , Smokin’ Aces ) is on writing duty for the upcoming X-Force film. If you’re not familiar with this part of the X-Men universe, X-Force was created in the early ’90s by Rob Leifeld and Fabian Nicieza. These characters are described as the “militant” and “more aggressive” counterparts to the X-Men team. Some of the characters involved have been Cable, Cannonball, Domino, Warpath and Deadpool, as well as Wolverine, Psylocke, Sunspot and Colossus. \nThere seems to be a trend toward darker superhero films, as evidenced by the success of Deadpool and the upcoming Logan , which opens on March 3. Having these guys on the job seems to show it continuing. If you’re at all familiar with the first season of Daredevil , you’ll get an idea of what Goddard can do. Same goes for Carnahan and The Grey . We want to know what you think. Are you a fan of the R-rated versions of these stories? What do you think of the writers currently on the job? What characters do you want to see in X-Force ?
