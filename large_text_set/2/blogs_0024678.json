Tap on the group conversation to open it and enter the thread. Tap the names of the people in the conversation or the group name at the top of the screen. It should be beside a little grey arrow.\n\nTap Leave Group . You might have to scroll a little bit to see it. Tap Leave once the prompt appears. The group will now disappear from your messages.\n\nAnd that's it! You'll no longer receive messages for this conversation unless someone adds you back in.\nAlternatively, in the messages information section you can turn off notifications instead of leaving if you'd like to still be able to read the thread but just don't want to be notified of new messages, but leaving a group is a much more permanent solution.\nHow do you use Facebook messenger? Do you prefer to use Facebook messenger for group chats, or do you find the app obnoxious and annoying?
