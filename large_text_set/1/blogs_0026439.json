( WMT ) announced today that it would offer free two-day shipping on 2 million of its most popular essentials like diapers, pet food and cleaning supplies to its U.S. customers on orders over $35. This replaces their previous program, ShippingPass, which offered unlimited two-day shipping for orders above $49. Customers who had signed up for it will receive full reimbursement. \n“I couldn’t be more excited. We are moving at the speed of a startup,” said Marc Lore, president and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. e-commerce, in a statement . “Two-day free shipping is the first of many moves we will be making to enhance the customer experience and accelerate growth.” \nThe announcement comes as a response to rival Amazon's ( AMZN ) thunderous success with it's Prime membership program, which charges $99 annually for unlimited free shipping among a host of other benefits. Forty-four percent of U.S. households pay for Amazon's prime membership, according to an analysis by Cowen and Company.

We believe this is the most compelling all-around value proposition for customers looking for low prices, a broad assortment and quick shipping,\" said Lore in a separate blog post. \nAlthough on the surface it may seem like Wal-Mart's deal throws Prime out of the game, there are big differences in what each offers. Firstly, Prime members do not require a minimum order amount, while currently Wal-Mart offers their free two-day shipping on a minimum order of $35. More importantly, Amazon offers a much larger selection of items, including access to movies, TV shows and video streaming services. Just earlier this month, Amazon also announced a credit card exclusively for Prime members that offered 5% back on all Amazon purchases.

Its acquisition of Lore's ecommerce startup Jet.com for $3 billion last year was meant to boost it's strength in this territory. Starting in February, both companies will share fulfillment centers although their brands will remain distinct. Lore made the decision to acquire ecommerce company Shoebuy earlier this month, while also unveiling a new e-commerce leadership team for Wal-Mart. He recently laid off 200 employees, according to Fortune , in a move aimed at a company-wide reorganization effort. \nMore changes are in the works as well, as Lore announced in the blog.

For me, the road ahead is pretty simple: We’ll keep our fanatical commitment to saving customers money – it’s who we are. And we’re going to be equally obsessed with saving our customers time,” he added. \nStay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T16:36:02.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
