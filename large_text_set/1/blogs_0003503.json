Orr, as he does every year, surprised the first couple to apply for a marriage license in 2017 with an immediate ceremony and gifts. \nThe couple actually wanted to get married Tuesday, and did not know about the usual 24-hour waiting period. Orr performed the impromptu, but very official, ceremony in his office. WBBM’s Craig Dellimore reports. \nWhy did the two nursing home workers want to get married? \nThe couple said they have waited long enough and losing family members made them realize how important family was. \nCharlotte Passley said she and Darnell Lane just woke up one day and decided to get married. \n“It’s time,” Passley said. “Life is too short. And we lost a couple of people along the way of our relationship during the way, including my mother, so I just thought it was time for our kids to see us as a unit stop ‘playing’ house and become house.” \nThe couple has four kids, ages ranging 12 to four, between the two of them. \nThe lucky couple received donated flowers, Eli’s cheesecake and other goodies, a stay at Lowes Chicago Hotel, dinner at Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse and more. \nThey plan to celebrate Tuesday night and said they are excited to show their marriage ceremony to their friends and family on TV. \nWill the couple hold another ceremony for friends and family who missed this one? \nNo, said Passley.
