Wade decision that legalized abortion in the United States. \nTrump signed it one day after the 44th anniversary of Roe. v. Wade. \nRepublicans supported the move, with Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska saying \"the Mexico City Policy reflects our heartfelt compassion for both moms and babies.\" \nThe Centre for Health and Gender Equity said the policy will lead to the death of women. \n\"The global gag rule has been associated with an increase in unsafe abortions and we expect that Trump's global gag rule will cost women their lives,\" said Serra Sippel, the organization's president. \nMarie Stopes International, a global charity that operates in 37 countries and gets funding in part from USAID, estimates the gag order signed by Trump will prevent it from offering contraception to 1.5 million women per year and lead to 2.1 million more abortions in the next three years. \nA study by the World Health Organization found that while George W. Bush was in office the number of abortions in sub-Saharan Africa rose as a direct result of his implementation of the policy. \nThe WHO estimates that 56 million abortions are performed each year but the rate at which they take place is dropping, from 40 per 1,000 women of childbearing age in in 1990-1994 to 35 per 1,000 women of childbearing age in 2010-2014. \nMost of the decline is in developed regions of the world, going from 46 to 27 per 1,000 in that timeframe. \nGlobally, 25 percent of pregnancies end in abortion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:19:58.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
