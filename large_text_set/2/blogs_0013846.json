However, both have been suffering from slight niggles and knocks, and have not been risked ahead of the trip to Valencia in midweek. 1' KICK-OFF! Espanyol, donning their dark away strip, get proceedings up and running at a sun-soaked Santiago Bernabeu. The big news for Madrid is, of course, the fact that Gareth Bale is back on the bench, having returned from his injury lay-off. With Benzema not in the squad, the Wales star is likely to get a run-out at some point this afternoon. The teams are in the tunnel now, as we rapidly approach kick-off at the Santiago Bernabeu, which is of course, packed full of fans. Three changes then from Quique Sanchez Flores, whose side lost to in-form Real Sociedad last time out, ending a three-match winning run. With Espanyol switching from a 4-4-2 to a more conservative 4-2-3-1 for this fixture, striker Felipe Caicedo drops out to be replaced by holding midfielder Papa Diop. In defence, Marc Navarro is replaced by Oscar Duarte, while ahead of the back four, Pablo Piatti is favoured over Hernan Perez. Former Real Madrid goalkeeper Diego Lopez is stationed in-between the sticks. TEAM NEWS - Espanyol substitutes: Jimenez, R.Duarte, Alvarez, Caicedo, Perez, Vazquez, Roca. TEAM NEWS - Espanyol (4-2-3-1): Lopez; D.Reyes, Lopez, O.Duarte, Martin; Fuego, Diop; J.Reyes, Jurado, Piatti; Moreno. No shortage in changes from Zinedine Zidane from the Madrid line-up that started in the Champions league victory over Napoli. Karim Benzema ended his recent goal-drought with a fine header in that game, but he is rested today, with Alvaro Morata his replacement. Out wide, James Rodriguez is replaced by Lucas Vazquez, while Sergio Ramos misses out through injury. Pepe is drafted in in his place, with Nacho taking Marcelo’s spot at left-back. In midfield, Casemiro and Luca Modric drop out, with Isco and Mateo Kovacic preferred. TEAM NEWS - Real Madrid substitutes: Rodriguez, Bale, Marcelo, Casemiro, Diaz, Asensio, Yanez. TEAM NEWS - Real Madrid (4-3-3): Kiko Casilla; Carvajal, Varane, Pepe, Nacho; Kovacic, Kroos, Isco; Vazquez, Morata, Ronaldo. The team news is in from Madrid. Let’s start off with the hosts… Espanyol, on the other hand, are in ninth, though would move into the top eight with a victory today as they look to join the hunt for Europe. Madrid sit just one point clear of Espanyol’s city-rivals Barcelona - who face struggling Leganes on Sunday - though they have played two games less than Luis Enrique Garcia’s side heading into this round of fixtures. It promises to be an enthralling clash this afternoon, and it’s one that Madrid will be confident of winning. They have not lost to Espanyol in their last 20 LaLiga meetings in the Spanish capital, with their last home defeat against the Catalan side coming in 1996.
