But the resounding loss at the Ninth Circuit, in which a judge nominated by George W. Bush joined two judges appointed by Democratic presidents, suggests there are few realistic options for the administration—short of shredding the executive order and drafting it anew. The appeals court in San Francisco was not tasked with determining the legality of Mr Trump’s ban. Its ruling only addresses whether a temporary restraining order put on the ban by a district judge in Seattle should be lifted before a full trial takes place in several weeks. The government’s lawyers argued in their briefs and in a hearing on February 7th that America’s national security would be endangered if the district court’s order was permitted to stand. Mr Trump believed the travel and immigration restrictions imposed in his January 27th executive order were necessary to protect the nation, his lawyer said, and presidents have “unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class of aliens”. In its 29-page ruling, drafted in less than 48 hours, the Ninth Circuit panel turned to a host of Supreme Court precedents to reject this proposition. It is “uncontroversial”, the judges wrote, that “courts owe substantial deference to the immigration and national security policy determinations” of Congress and the president. This idea is “well-grounded in our jurisprudence”. But it is another matter entirely to claim that this deference is absolute. “[T]he Supreme Court has repeatedly and explicitly rejected the notion that the political branches have unreviewable authority over immigration or are not subject to the Constitution when policymaking in that context”, the order reads. It is “beyond question...that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action”. With Mr Trump’s what-I-say-must-go position safely dealt with, the panel set to work asking whether his lawyers had built enough of a case to lift the restraining order. There were two main questions: whether the government “made a strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits” in an eventual trial; and whether waiting for the case to be resolved by the district court means the government will be “irreparably injured” in the meantime. The Ninth Circuit answered “no” to both questions. First, the panel noted serious due-process concerns with Mr Trump’s executive order which may doom it in court. The ban lacks several requirements of due process as enshrined in the Fifth Amendment—including giving people “notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual’s ability to travel”. (The judges did not say much about other potential legal and constitutional problems with the ban, as one infirmity would be enough to invalidate it. They did note, though, that there is at least a plausible case for viewing the executive order as a violation of the First Amendment’s rule against religious establishments as well.) Second, there is no irreparable harm associated with keeping the ban in limbo: “The government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States”, they wrote, and there is no reason for the court to believe that reverting to previous immigration rules that had been in place for “many previous years” would put the country at risk. Mr Trump’s “see you in court” promise raises the interesting question of which court. There are at least three possibilities, none of them promising for the Trump administration. First, it could petition the Supreme Court to step in and lift the restraining order on the travel ban. This option might be the swiftest, but it would require the agreement of five of the eight justices, and it is hard to imagine any of the four liberal-leaning justices siding with the conservatives to do that (if indeed all four conservatives would be on board, which is no sure thing). Second, the administration could ask the Ninth Circuit for a so-called en banc hearing where all 25 active judges would have a say and could potentially undo the three-judge panel ruling. But as Steve Vladeck of the University of Texas law school points out, 18 of the 25 are Democratic appointees; the likelihood of such an array of judges coming to Mr Trump’s defence is vanishingly small. Third, it could simply wait for the hearing in the Seattle district court that issued the restraining order in the first place and hope to build a better case in the meantime. With even Neil Gorsuch, Mr Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, lamenting attacks on judges as \"disheartening\" and \"demoralising\", it is unclear what the new president's best option might be. Whichever path lawyers from the Department of Justice end up taking, America’s judiciary seems to have roadblocks waiting at every turn to thwart one of Mr Trump's signature campaign promises.
