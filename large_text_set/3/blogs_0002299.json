The movie based on an action video game is set in Hong Kong and focuses on martial arts fighting, racing, boat chases … and shooting while doing all of that.\nSo, basically it sounds a lot like Hard Boiled or any of the brilliant Hong Kong action flicks of yore. As any fan of those movies can tell you, it’s super gritty and visceral—which, I guess, describes the original game pretty well. Yen’s certainly up for the physical challenge that’s sure to come with this type of role, as he boasts a long, storied career in martial arts movies, starting with the Ip Man series, where he played a Wing Chun martial arts master.\nWhile you would be forgiven for staying cautiously guarded around something being touted as a film adaptation of a video game, I’d suggest you should perhaps keep your mind open for this one. Yen is a force to be reckoned with, and he shines in so many different ways. It’s just great to see that more Hollywood mainstream creatives are seeing him that way too, now.\n(image via Lucasfilm/Disney)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
