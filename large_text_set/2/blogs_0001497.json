Reds still hopeful By Jose Rodel Clapano (The Philippine Star)   NDFP spokesperson Fidel Agcaoili and consultant Randall Echanis at a press conference in Davao City. Philstar.com/AJ Bolando \nMANILA, Philippines - The National Democratic Front (NDF) remains hopeful that peace negotiations will continue despite President Duterte’s decision to scuttle the government’s unilateral ceasefire with communist rebels. \nNDF chief peace negotiator Fidel Agcaoili said they are also looking forward to the approval of the “comprehensive agreements on socio-economic, political and constitutional reforms” by both peace panels before the end of the year. \nAgcaoili stressed the two parties could “talk while fighting,” citing their experience during the time of former president Fidel Ramos. \nHe said the government has the prerogative to lift its unilaterally issued ceasefire. \nAgcaoili added they are also hoping that the government and the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) will jointly create a federal system of government to achieve a just and lasting peace. \nThe NDF is the umbrella organization representing the CPP-NPA in the peace talks with the government.   \nThe CPP-NPA-NDF and the government had separately declared a ceasefire as they resumed peace talks. \nDuterte earlier terminated the government’s unilateral ceasefire in response to the NPA’s lifting of its own ceasefire it declared in August last year. \nAgcaoili maintained the NPA’s scuttling of its interim ceasefire had basis. \nEven while the police and military operations against the rebels were suspended, the government still allowed security forces to encroach on areas occupied by the NPA. \n“The extrajudicial killings of leaders and members of peasant groups and indigenous peoples have also gone on unabated with four being killed in January alone and another one just today,” Agcaoili said in a statement to GMA-7 News . \nAgcaoili said the NPA has strictly maintained its own unilateral ceasefire and took extraordinary measures to avoid encounters with the military while remaining on active defense mode. \nAgcaoili also pointed out the government has the obligation under the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law to release all political prisoners. \nIt was one of the main reasons the CPP-NPA-NDF dropped its unilateral ceasefire, citing the government’s failure to abide by the agreement, he said. \n“Some of these political prisoners have languished in jail for more than 10 years without conviction, in violation of the right to speedy trial as provided for in the Constitution,” Agcaoili said. \nHe said 14 of the political prisoners have died in prison, 13 of them during the Aquino administration and another under Duterte. \nAgcaoili claimed some “well-meaning military and police officers” have admitted knowing that many political prisoners are innocent civilians who happened to be in the vicinity of armed encounters, or ordinary activists used as scapegoats to compensate for failed military and police missions. \n“The NDFP has already proposed as early as October 2016 that the release and amnesty of all political prisoners can come after the signing of the CASER (Comprehensive Agreement on Socio-economic Reforms) without prejudice to the early release of those who are sick, elderly, long-term detainees, women and innocent civilians on humanitarian grounds,” Agcaoili said. \n“It behooves the GRP to require its prosecutors not to allow the (military) and (police) to dictate the charges to be filed with their planted evidence and false witnesses against alleged or suspected political offenders,” Agcaoili added. \nA militant group said Duterte’s lifting of the ceasefire made no difference since the military had always been operating in the countryside. \nThe Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya) also accused Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief Gen. Eduardo Año and Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana of sabotaging the peace talks with the communist rebels. \nThe militant group accused Año and Lorenzana of allowing the military to continue its operations in rural areas during the government’s ceasefire. \nPamalakaya said the troops in the field ignored Duterte and took orders only from Año and Lorenzana in their continuing operations affecting farmers and fisherfolk in rural areas. \n“We are always in support of the peace negotiations, not only to end the decades-old civil war, but also to attain a genuine development for the benefit of the Filipino people,” Pamalakaya chairman Fernando Hicap said. – Ding Cervantes, Ghio Ong  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:50:51.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
