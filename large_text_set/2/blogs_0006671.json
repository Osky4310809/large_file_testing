Some things to note: If you are submitting an image where the land is silhouetted, it will be removed and referred to /r/skyporn . If you are submitting an image with man made objects present, unless they are very small and barely noticeable it will be removed and referred to /r/ruralporn or another appropriate network subreddit. Include the location in the title. Include the photographer's name/username in the title. If you are posting your own image make sure to tag it with [OC] as doing so will earn special flair.If you don't receive flair in 24 hours feel free to message the mods. Include the resolution in [brackets] in the title. Do not edit, rehost or modify images submitted here without permission of the photographer. This includes edits to \"fix\" the colors of an image or remove a watermark. Do not name or reference the device you used to take the photograph you are posting in the title of your post. This information should be posted in the comments. Only submit static images. New: Non-OC submissions are restricted to one per day.
