Mayweather went on ESPN’s First Take to explain why Dubai wouldn’t be a possibility for the upcoming boxing match and Wack 100 stepped in to make a few clarifications. \nWack, who also happens to manage Ray J and The Game, tells TMZ that this is a West Coast thing and the fight will be going to Dubai. He also says that neither Floyd Mayweather nor 50 Cent are needed for the fight and confirms that Mike Tyson is directly involved. \n“Floyd and 50 ain’t never controlled nothing that’s a West Coast situation. No disrespect,” he says. “It would be hard for me to control something that’s New York-based and 50’s involved. So at the end of the day, the Dubai situation, that’s something that I’ve put together. I already got paperwork on one of the fighters already. It’s Piru business right now.” \nBoth Soulja and Breezy claim to be affiliates of the West Coast Piru Blood gang. Soulja spoke on his “membership” with Floyd on Hollywood Unlocked . \nThe love for Floyd is there but Wack says he’s just “a guy from Michigan who lives in Vegas.” He hopes that everyone else has more respect for the situation because he means serious business. \nIt’s so serious, Kelly Price is slated to sing the national anthem the day of the showdown. \nWatch Wack 100 explain the politics of Soulja Boy and Chris Brown’s upcoming fight below.
