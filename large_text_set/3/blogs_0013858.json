Together they hold more population than all of the blue territories on the map.\nVisual Capitalist\nThat’s right, the blue area contains the entirety of many significant countries, such as Canada, Australia, Norway, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia. The blue even includes parts of China, the United States, and most of Russia.\nGETTING MORE EXTREME Here’s the kicker – the disparity is only getting more intense. Take a look at the following map of the fastest growing cities, showing the rate of new citizens per hour:\nVisual Capitalist\nDhaka, the largest city in Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing cities in the world with a growth rate of 74 people per hour . Kolkata (India) is also up there, adding 32 citizens every hour.\nMeanwhile, the cities within the blue area of the original map do not have the same kind of growth happening at all.\nFOR THE NUMBERS GEEKS Here are the original calculations, from Metrocosm , for the blue and red areas of the original map in case you are interested. It’s worth noting that the data was retrieved in 2015, so it is slightly out of date.\nThe “Blue” Regions\nVisual Capitalist The “Red” Regions\nVisual Capitalist Read the original article on Visual Capitalist .
