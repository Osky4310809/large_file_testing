Once an honorable institution, the Watch has fallen on hard times by the time of the War of the Five Kings . It has become grievously undermanned, numbering less than a thousand men, an all-time low. While once great glory and honor was to be had in the Watch, in the present day it is often seen as a glorified penal colony. \nThe current headquarters of the Watch is Castle Black , located in the shadow of the Wall at the northern end of the Kingsroad . [1] Eastwatch-by-the-Sea , located at the eastern end of the Wall, serves as the main port and resupply post for the Night's Watch. The Shadow Tower at the western end of the Wall is the only other manned castle. [2] Among the abandoned castles along the length of the Wall is the Nightfort , the first fortress built on the Wall and the original headquarters of the Night's Watch. [3] [4] The region south of the Wall is called the Gift , bestowed to the Night's Watch by House Stark thousands of years ago to supply the Night's Watch with food and provisions. [5] \nIn the past, the Night's Watch would send men out every morning to the north side of the Wall to cut down any trees growing within one mile of the structure, so the wildlings couldn't use any natural cover to approach the base of the Wall undetected. With the ranks of the Night's Watch drastically diminishing over the years, many of the areas between the three forts that are still manned have tall trees growing right up to the base of the Wall. [6] Defenses Edit \nThe Watch employs a variety of defenses in order to defend the Wall. The top of the Wall is dug out in a trench-like manner to give protection from the weather. Several outlets and wooden pillboxes give archers a way to fire on enemies below. A special pulley system allows archers to hang over the edge of the Wall to fire straight down on enemies attempting to climb it. Other defenses includes ramps for barrels filled with burning oil or ice and stone to drop on attackers. The Watch also has ballistae and catapults strong enough to kill giants. Perhaps the most impressive defense mechanism is the \"scythe\", a massive, bladed pendulum that runs along the Wall with tremendous force, brutally mauling anyone within its swinging arc and raining ice on those below. Following its release, the scythe can be retracted to prime it for another swing. [6] [7] \nThe physical nature of the Wall is its greatest defense, regardless of how many men garrison it. The Wall is too tall and thick to simply smash through. The height of the Wall itself serves as its strongest defense. Normal archers cannot fire all the way to the top. Considering that wildlings don't possess much in the way of advanced weaponry like ballistae, only giants armed with huge bows have any feasible chance at hitting defenders on the top. The Wall can also shed large sheets of ice if disturbed, making scaling it an unpredictable and incredibly dangerous endeavor. [6] [7] \nOn the ground, there are tunnels for rangers returning from beyond-the-wall expeditions. The tunnel is guarded by an outer 4 inch thick, cold rolled steel gate, and a thin slotted inner gate. Scale and unit conversion Edit \nMeasurements in the Seven Kingdoms in both the books and TV series are given in imperial measurements. The Wall is about 100 leagues or 300 miles (482 kilometers) long, about 700 feet tall (213 meters) and averages 300 feet in width (91 meters). \nIn \" Mhysa \", Samwell Tarly says that the Wall is 500 miles long. This appears to be an error, as the books clearly state that it is 300 miles long and the evidence in the TV show (such as the distances given for Winterfell to Torrhen's Square and the faster speed of travel between Winterfell and King's Landing ) suggests that Westeros may actually be smaller than in the books, while the Wall being 500 miles long would actually make it substantially larger. The claim that the Wall is 300 miles long is further supported in Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series , where Britt Warrick says to Gared Tuttle \"a 300-mile wall, and you're still in my way\". The game is canon to the show so it is possible that Sam was wrong.
