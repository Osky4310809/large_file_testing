Or, is it greater than the sum of its parts? \nIn an apparent attempt to question some very basic assumptions about cheeseburgers, philosophical Twitter user @coL_Merchant went to McDonald's and ordered a \"burger\" without onions, ketchup, mustard, pickles, bun, or beef patty from one of the restaurant's unmanned payment terminals. \nWhile so many chefs merely deconstruct American classics, @coL_Merchant is blowing one up 'til there is nothing left but its lone cheesy core. \nMerchant admitted on Twitter that he did not know what to expect, suggesting that the order was more performance art than source of nourishment. And, like all great art, it came at a great price for its creatorâ€”GBP 0.99, to be exact. \nMany were confused by the motivation for the Tweet, Merchant assured his followers to \"just accept the cheese\" if they want to better understand the sad, orange square that remains when a McDonald's cheeseburger is stripped of all its other basic components. \nWhat Merchant makes us realize is that we all have a sad square of processed cheese at our core. \nWe just have to accept it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T03:10:43.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
