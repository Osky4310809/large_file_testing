Wikileaks alleges the CIA has achieved \"political and budgetary preeminence\" over its rival and built a world-class hacking team so it no longer has to rely on the NSA. \nIf the allegations in the press release are true, they should send chills down the spines of anyone who had the fanciful idea they could avoid government spies with encrypted chat apps. \nThat is far from the only stunning item in the release as well as the documents. Wikileaks, of course, has had significant credibility issues since it began to align itself with President Donald Trump during his campaign for the presidency against rival Hillary Clinton. \nMashable will be working to verify specific claims in the documents to the best of our ability. \nBONUS: Edward Snowden says Russians probably hacked the NSA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:18:22.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
