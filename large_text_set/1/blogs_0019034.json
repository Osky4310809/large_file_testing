The figures are always loaded with tons of articulation, allowing collectors to recreate poses and fight scenes straight from the comics, just with a touch of visual flair. \nThe newest figure in the series is the mad Canuck himself Wolverine . The classic blue and yellow theme is utilized here as well, though the blue is much darker in hue and uses the yellow as an accent. The mask has heightened ears, and the shoulders come down onto the chest plate to form claw marks. There's a load of detail in his arms, and fans can opt for a stoic or angry expression with an interchangeable portrait. \nThe figure also comes with three interchangeable hands sans claws, and four interchangeable hands with claws. He also comes with a Katana. \nYou can view more images of the impressive X-Man on the next slide. Wolverine is up for pre-order now and will run for $149.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T03:00:14.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
