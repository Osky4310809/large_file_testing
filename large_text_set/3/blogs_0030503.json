It is not even worth a reaction since those statements are fabrications designed to justify the failure of the US military and politicians in the Afghan campaign,” Zamir Kabulov, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s director of the Second Asian Department in Afghanistan, told RIA Novosti on Friday.

Needless to say, all this is not supported by any evidence, ” the ministry said in a statement. \n“Promulgation of such absurd inventions reveals a staged campaign to discredit our country, during which the Afghan and the world communities are being supplied with the thesis that Russia is ‘undermining’ international anti-terrorist efforts in Afghanistan,” the statement added. Moscow said it is quite obvious that “certain forces, both outside and inside Afghanistan,” are behind attempts to discredit Russia. \n“This is also designed to divert attention from [their] responsibility for numerous mistakes made in over 16 years of foreign military presence in Afghanistan.” \nCalling the current situation in Afghanistan a “ stalemate,” US Army General John Nicholson recently told the US Senate Armed Services Committee that while he has enough troops for counterterrorism operations against the likes of the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), he would like several thousand more in order to boost the capabilities of the Afghan security forces. Nicholson said any troop injections could come from the US military or NATO nations. \nAbout 8,400 US troops and 6,400 NATO soldiers remain in Afghanistan, following the large-scale NATO troop reduction there in 2014. US-led forces entered Afghanistan to remove Taliban control more than 15 years ago, following the attacks of September 11, 2001.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:38:27.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
