It remains unclear how he was able to orchestrated the attack without ever coming to the attention of authorities.\n“I’ve found that there tends to be less serious attention paid to the right wing,” said Daniel Gallant, a former white supremacist who left the hate movement and is currently a social worker and law student in British Columbia.\nNow focused on preventing youths from joining extremist groups, Gallant said the reluctance to apply the tools of terrorism to the far right was a problem. “With this inconsistent view of what terrorism is, we end up with all these gaps.”\nGavin Young/Calgary Herald Christianne Boudreau listens as Daniel Gallant speaks at the U of C launch of Extreme Dialogue, an online video project designed to prevent violent extremi,ross Canada. Gallant, who was a violent neo-nazi was one of the profiles in the project. He said a simple look at Canada’s history showed the far right had been violent. He also believes it is on the rise, partly as a result of the populist political debate taking place in the United States and Europe. “I think that we need to pay attention,” he said.\nHate groups were once a key concern of CSIS, which infiltrated the racist Heritage Front, causing its collapse in the 1990s. Since then, followers of al-Qaida-type ideology have become Canada’s main terrorism focus.\nThe most recent CSIS annual report, covering the 2013-2014 fiscal year, said right-wing extremists were “fragmented and primarily pose a threat to public order and not to national security.”\nRelated Right-wing extremist groups ‘prevalent’ across Canada, study warns The unexpected transformation of Aaron Pearlston: He is now Douglas Pearson, white supremacist A hater among us: This Oshawa, Ont., drywaller is the leader of the White Nationalist Front “The majority of individuals involved in the milieu in Canada hold strong racist and anti-immigration views, but do not overly propose serious acts of violence,” according to a 2012 CSIS Intelligence Assessment.\nA study commissioned by Public Safety Canada last year documented 49 “supremacist-motivated” incidents between 2001 and 2015, mostly in Alberta and Ontario. “Most incidents appear to be isolated and spontaneous assaults targeting ethnic/religious minorities,” it said.\nChris Mikula/Canwest News Service Richard Fadden in Ottawa Fadden, who was the CSIS director from 2009-2013 and served as security advisor to prime ministers Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau, said the far right had not been neglected by counter-terrorism officials.\n“I think over the last decade or so the police and CSIS have been keeping an eye on right wing extremism in Canada. I think the general view has been that there is some. It’s relatively localized. And honestly I don’t think these entities thought that they were particularly prone to violence.”\nHe described the extreme right as “little groups” that “talk big” but did not seem willing to act. “So I think the hope of the community based on this kind of experience is that the right wingers would be relatively less inclined to violence than has been proven to be the case here.”\nHe said the Quebec City mosque killings appeared to be a lone wolf attack, which he called “the hardest category of terrorist attack to deal with” and “almost impossible to prevent.”\nNotwithstanding the “appalling atrocity” in Quebec City, Fadden said the main terrorist threat to Canada remained extremists inspired by the ideologies of al-Qaida and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\nNational Post \n• Email: sbell@nationalpost.com | Twitter: @StewartBellNP \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:39:16.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
