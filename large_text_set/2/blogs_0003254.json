Media reports say she fell onto iron railings and was taken to a hospital, where she died. \nWest China Metropolis Daily reported on Sunday that the family of the girl, Gan Yajie, had reached a compensation agreement with the park for their only child's death amounting to 870,000 yuan ($126,700). \nThe newspaper also said the ride had passed a routine quality inspection in December. \nThe General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said that it had asked Chongqing authorities to suspend all of the park's large amusement facilities to \"carry out checks and eliminate hidden dangers\". \nIt also ordered companies operating the same \"Travel Through Space\" ride across the country to immediately suspend its use and contact the Chengdu-based manufacturer for further checks. 1.
