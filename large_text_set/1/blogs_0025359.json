Celtuce, otherwise known in English as stem lettuce, asparagus lettuce, celery lettuce, or Chinese lettuce, and in Chinese called wosun , is a green vegetable that, you've probably surmised, comes from China. It's got leaves, but the stem is the main attraction. It's crisp, mild, and a little nutty, making it great for things like stir-fries and pickles. According to some home cooks , it's better than broccoli in every way.\nRelated 5 Ways to Cook With Vegetable Cores View article Kian Lam Kho, proprietor of the Chinese home-cooking blog Red Cook , writes, \"It is a refreshingly crunchy and succulent vegetable that contrasts well with other ingredients in stir-fries and cold dishes because it keeps its crunchy texture even after cooking and marinating.\" Kho adds that as a little boy in Singapore, when he caught a cold he would enjoy plain rice porridge with some \"crunchy salty and sweet celtuce pickle full of soy umami\" served alongside. (His pickle recipe is here .)\n\"Sel-TOOS\"? Nope—\"celtuce\" is a portmanteau of \"celery\" and \"lettuce.\" It's pronounced like the thing Girl Scouts do with cookies (\"sell\"), and the second syllable rhymes with \"bus.\"\nWhere do you get it and how do you prepare it? Celtuce is common at Chinese markets—check there—but less available elsewhere, despite the fact that its seeds have been for sale in the U.S. for almost 80 years (see below). In the Huffington Post, Joe Satran attributes its enduring obscurity to a \"vicious cycle.\" \"It’s not popular enough for many farmers to grow, so it’s not widely distributed, which keeps people from being able to try it, which keeps it unpopular,\" he writes.\nOnce you get it home, you'll want to peel the tough skin off of the stem. After that, do whatever you want with it: eat it raw in salads , pickle it , roast it , stir-fry it . (In this way, the asparagus comparison is apt: celtuce is just as multipurpose.) In Land of Fish and Rice , her most recent cookbook, Fuchsia Dunlop writes, \"The leafy tips are fabulous stir-fried with nothing more than oil and salt. ... The stems, however, are the real treasures. Shorn of their fibrous outer layers, they are delicate, translucent and the prettiest pale green.\" Dunlop likes them fresh or lightly sauteed in salads, or stir-fried or added to \"slow-simmered stews.\"\nAnd here's a recipe for a simple Sichuan celtuce stir-fry from the blog China Sichuan Food, where you'll also find recipes for wood-ear stir-fry with celtuce and yam and celtuce salad with spring onion , which is garnished with bright-red chile pepper.\nYou haven't mentioned if it will spiralize, though. Celtuce will indeed spiralize . But really you don't even need a spiralizer for this one: a vegetable peeler is enough for you to produce long, flat, beautiful celtuce noodles.\nHow did celtuce get to the U.S.? Good story, actually: Celtuce seeds arrived in the U.S. via none other than David Burpee, he of Burpee seed company fame—David was the son of W. Atlee Burpee, who founded the business. Both were rapacious seed collectors. In his heyday, before World War I, W. Atlee traveled 30,000 miles annually to find seeds to bring back stateside (at least according to an extremely long company history ), and David maintained connections with some expats in, among other places, China—including Pearl S. Buck and a missionary named Carter Holton, who coughed up the Chinese-lettuce seeds.\nThe Burpee company introduced the seeds for sale in the United States in 1938; Burpee, too, coined the name celtuce .\nWhat are people saying about celtuce? What aren't they saying? In Land of Fish and Rice , Fuchsia Dunlop included a couple celtuce recipes \"because of my fervent hope that this exquisite vegetable, a kind of lettuce with thick, truncheon-like stems, will become more widely available outside China.\" The chef April Bloomfield says it's \"the most underrated vegetable.\" Ruth Reichl's a big fan . Cooks everywhere praise its flavor and its broad versatility. If you're unfamiliar, then, perhaps it's time to make celtuce's acquaintance.\nCONTINUE READING tags: Chinese Vegetable Lettuce Leafy Green", "external_links": ["http://www.chinasichuanfood.com/celtuce-salad-with-spring-onion/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/17/celtuce_n_6330026.html", "http://redcook.net/", "http://redhawkfarmnc.com/our-blog/2015/10/19/celtuce", "http://soyricefire.com/2013/04/21/celtuce-ribbon-salad/", "https://www.burpee.com/gardenadvicecenter/get-to-know/the-legacy-of-w.-atlee-burpee/legacy.html", "http://www.chinasichuanfood.com/stir-fried-celtuce-stem/", "http://ruthreichl.com/2015/06/im-no-longer-burst-with-enthusiasm-every-time-i-see-celtuce-on-a-menu-many-chinese-restaurants-source-it-year-round-and.html/", "http://www.bonappetit.com/people/chefs/article/famous-chefs-chat-eat-healthy-restaurants", "http://www.chinasichuanfood.com/wood-ear-stir-fry-with-celtuce-stem-and-yam/", "http://redcook.net/2015/09/23/its-not-too-late-to-pickle-celtuce/", "http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/sustainag/extn_pub/veggie%20pubs/Oriental%20Vegetables/Chineses%20Lettuce.pdf", "http://phickle.com/celtuce/", "http://www.burpee.com/", "http://www.saveur.com/article/recipes/stir-fried-celtuce-tops-with-mushrooms"], "published": "2017-01-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:41:31.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
