Most Popular By Jaya Saxena Mar 20, 2017 Here's some news that is probably obvious to anyone who's thought about it for more than a second: Giving women birth control saves money! Lots of it! Like, billions of dollars, to be specific! According to a study from Child Trends , commissioned by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, if everyone who didn't want to get pregnant had access to effective birth control, there would be fewer abortions and unintended births. And since things like abortions and hospital stays tend to cost money, access to birth control would mean saving money: \"Substantial reductions in unintended pregnancy would translate to $12 billion dollars in public health care cost savings annually, reducing the public costs of unintended pregnancy by half,\" the study finds. GIF We could make it r in. GIPHY Advertisement   $12 billion is a lot of money, and having a lot of money to do specific things is something Donald Trump is very concerned about, so much so that he's willing to cut a lot of very necessary public programs in order to hoard it for...something that's probably a lot worse than anything the Appalachian Regional Commission is capable of. That $12 billion could buy a lot of things, such as: 24 Water and Wastewater loan and grant programs , which provides funding for clean water systems. ($498 million). 375 Minority Business Development Agencies , a program that promotes the development of minority-owned small businesses. ($32 million). 425 State Energy programs , which give grants to states to work on renewable and clean energy. ($28.2 million). Almost 30 nursing training programs, which Trump says \"lack evidence that they significantly improve the nation's health workforce.\" ($403 million). 4 Community Development Block Grant programs, which would affect Meals on Wheels programs, as wells as tons of community-based non-profits and programs like Head Start. ($3 billion). 900 National Wildlife Refuge funds , which are \"responsible for conserving, developing, utilizing and protecting this Nation's fish and wildlife resources for the enjoyment of all people.\" ($12.3 million). 9 Global Climate Change initiatives ($1.3 billion). 24 Corporations for Public Broadcasting ($485 million). 78 National Endowments for the Arts ($152 million). 77 National Endowments for the Humanities ($155 million). By the way, if you add up the budgets for each of these programs, you get just over $6 billion, so you could still fund twice as much . Oh my God why haven't we done this yet???
