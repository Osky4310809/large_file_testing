Following his comments earlier in the week that it was not just the Russians (but China and Iran maybe) that hacked US and that Trump \"may be playing us ,\" former CIA Director James Woolsey has parted ways with the president-elect and will no longer be a Senior Advisor . \nWoolsey did not appear to be toeing the company-line completely... \nFormer CIA director James Woolsey: Possibility that more than one country is involved in hacking is there. https://t.co/cxZqeyNvOI \n— New Day (@NewDay) January 3, 2017 \n\nAs we noted previously, The Hill reports , Woolsey, who was a senior advisor to President-elect Donald Trump , said: \n\"I don’t think people ought to say they know for sure there’s only one. I don’t think they’re likely to be proven correct. It shouldn’t be portrayed as one guilty party,\" \n\n“It’s much more complicated than that. This is not an organized operation that is hacking into a target. It’s more like a bunch of jackals at the carcass of an antelope .” \n\nWoolsey suggested China and Iran could be behind cyber breaches in the U.S. \n\n“Is it Russian? Probably some,” he said. \"Is it Chinese and Iranian? Maybe. We may find out more from Mr. Trump coming up today.” \nThis follows Trump's comments on Sunday hinting he would reveal new information about alleged Russian hacking during a New Year’s Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. \n“[I know] things that other people don’t know,” he said. \"I just want them to be sure because it’s a pretty serious charge. I think it’s unfair if they don’t know.” \nTo which Woolsey contentiously also commented: \n\"There’s a possibility that he is [playing us] a little bit.\" \nBut as is clear, Woolsey's belief that the Russians \"were in there\" still goes further than what Trump has said about the hacks ... which may be why Woolsey has announced in a formal statement \n\"Effective immediately, Ambassador Woolsey is no longer a Senior Adviser to President-elect Trump or the transition,\" Woolsey's spokesman, Jonathan Franks, wrote in a statement that was first reported by CNN's Jeremy Diamond. \n\n\"He wishes the President-elect and his Administration great success in their time in office.\" \nFurthermore, The Washington Post's Philip Rucker reports, Woolsey resigned after being cut out of intelligence talks with Trump and his national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:39:12.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
