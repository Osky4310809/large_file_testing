Rashid replaces Rohime Shafie, who has been reassigned to DRB-Hicom as the head of automotive in the automotive distribution and manufacturing & engineering division. Rohime was appointed as Proton Edar CEO in April last year. \nPrior to this appointment, Rashid was the chief technical officer at Proton, where he held several portfolios and was instrumental in the development of the four new models ( Perdana, Persona, Saga and Ertiga ) released by the carmaker in 2016. He sits on the board of several Proton subsidiaries and was previously the head of several companies within the DRB-Hicom group. \nThe automaker said it is confident that Rashid, leveraging on his technical background, will be able to drive further improvements in the Proton Edar network improvement plan, especially in enhancing the division’s after-sales service. \nThe announcement follows on the news earlier today that there had been a high profile reshuffle at the automaker. Proton is aiming to announce its new foreign partner in April , and a news report indicates that Groupe PSA of France and Geely are in the final running to be the eventual suitor, with the Chinese owner of Volvo reportedly leading the race.
