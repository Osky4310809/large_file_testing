Because you're a c*** and I'm not.\" \nTo which she responded: “Well, you are a bit of a c*** yourself. Being offensive to me does not make things better at all.\" \nShouting back, he said: \"Go f*** yourself\", to which the QC replied: \"You too. Take him down.\" \nHennigan was jailed for 18 months for insulting and making racist slurs to a black Caribbean mother in Harlow. \nThe judge’s use of language drew complaints to the Judicial Conducts Investigations Office (JCIO)but the body confirmed on Monday that no action will be taken. Man has sentence increased after calling judge a b**** in court \nAn investigation report sent by the JCIO to one of the complainants states: \"Although the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice considered HHJ Lynch's remarks to be inappropriate, they did not find that they amounted to misconduct or warranted disciplinary action.\" \n\"With the agreement of the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice therefore advised HHJ Lynch to ensure that she responded appropriately in court at all times.\" \nJudge Lynch has since \"apologised unreservedly for her remarks\". \nShe also told investigators she \"deeply regretted the incident\" and said her \"remarks were a momentary lapse of judgment which should have never happened\".
