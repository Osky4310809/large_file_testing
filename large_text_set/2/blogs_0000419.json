Spinach could also soon be in short supply (Photo: Getty) \nA Morrisons spokesman said: “‘As a result of the fact that the Spanish harvest has been very difficult this year, we have just about enough coming in to supply our customers. \n“We want to stop local tradespeople, restaurateurs, coming in and buying lots of stock. It is important that there is good availability for our customers.” \nTesco said: “Due to bad weather conditions in Spain, we are experiencing a few availability issues, but are working with our suppliers to resolve them as quickly as possible.” Courgettes were one of the first vegetables to be hit (Photo: Getty) \nA Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “Severe weather has affected crops, but we are working with our suppliers to maintain supply for our customers.” \nThe problem has become so serious that British wholesalers have taken the unusual step of importing produce from California, despite the high cost of transporting it by air. \nMeanwhile, garden centre chain Wyevale has seized on the crisis by buying in more “grow your own” vegetable seeds and plants so families can become more self-sufficient.
