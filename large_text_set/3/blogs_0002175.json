His remand period ends on Friday. \nPolice have identified seven other North Koreans wanted in connection with the case, including an embassy official in Kuala Lumpur. \nThe women were formally charged on Wednesday under section 302 of the penal code, which carries the death penalty. \nAmid a growing diplomatic row, a high level North Korean delegation arrived in the Malaysian capital on Tuesday to press for the release of citizen in custody, and for the body to be handed over. \nNorth Korea maintains the victim is a North Korean citizen, but has not acknowledged he is the half brother of its leader Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam was murdered at Kuala Lumpur international airport (Photo: Reuters) \nJust a day before the death of Jong-nam, half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Siti Aisyah said she was to take part in a ‘prank for a reality show’. \nIn a video published by China Daily, Siti Aisyah laughed and covered her face shyly when her friends commented she was going to be a ‘big star’. \nShe was 25 on February 11 - two days before Jong-nam was killed using the lethal chemical weapon VX in the budget airline terminal of Kuala Lumpur international airport. \n“I do not believe Siti Aisyah would kill someone just for money,” her best friend said. “It is impossible. I think she has been framed.” \nShe said Siti Aisyah did not know Jong-nam and had no motive to kill him. \nShe claimed Aisyah was innocent. Aisyah has told authorities she was paid £72 to carry out the attack , but thought they were wiping Jong-nam’s face with baby oil, not VX, the most lethal chemical agent known to man.

One was vomiting after the attack because of her exposure to a substance which is renowned as one of the world’s deadliest poisons. \nA hundredth of a gram is enough to kill within 30 minutes. A drop on a cloth would have been enough to take his life. \nExperts claim its use put beyond any doubt that the so-called ‘playboy prince’ had been assassinated on the orders of his half brother after he criticised the secretive communist regime in 2012. \nAbsorbed in large doses, it is fatal after 15 minutes, according to the US Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, making it the most toxic known nerve agent in the world. \nCCTV footage captured the moment Jong-nam was brazenly murdered at the packed airport. \nIt is still not known how the agent was applied without the woman becoming ill. \nFootage begins with him arriving at the concourse in Kuala Lumpur International Airport in a light jacket and carrying a backpack. \nHe is shown looking at the flight departure boards with other passengers.

(Photo: REUTERS) \nPolice also want to speak to Jong-nam’s mistress as they probe his murder, according to sources in Malaysia. \nNorth Korean So Yong Ra, 41, is a former air stewardess with Air Koryo, North Korea’s national flag carrier. \nHer name has previously been reported as So Yong La. \nChannel NewsAsia, who published a photo of her, said she was from Pyongyang. \nA police source said: “She is believed to have lived in Macau together with him since 2001 and eventually got married. \n“She worked at Air Koryo from 1992 to 1998. She studied at the Pyongyang Music and Dance University.” \nIt has been previously reported Jong-nam had two wives, at least one mistress and several children, including a son and a daughter by his second wife, Lee Hye-Kyong.
