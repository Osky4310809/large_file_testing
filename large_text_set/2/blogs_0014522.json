(AP Photo/Terry Renna) comments \nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Matt Tifft, 20, has been in auto racing since he was 12. But the product of Hinckley, Ohio admits he is now in a whole new world. This season will be his first in NASCAR's Xfinity Series and Daytona Speedway is looming. \nIt's the next step before the top NASCAR series after parts of there seasons racing NASCAR Trucks. \nNow with Joe Gibbs Racing, Tifft already understands he is in a really new element. \n\"The biggest change from trucks to cars, for me, is I feel more natural in a car than a truck,'' Tifft said. \"The Xfinity cars are interesting because here you have a chance to race against the Cup guys. It's a unique opportunity. That's like telling a basketball player that Lebron is going to come down a level and play against you. \n\"That's probably the biggest thing with me, racing against those guys and learning from those guys, trying to see what they do differently, and that will help me a lot with my process of becoming a better driver. You learn from the best, hands on, and jump right in there.\" \nTifft has been racing since he was 12. From go-karts at Barberton Speedway, he was soon driving in ARCA races, then NASCAR trucks by 2014 with allies like Ken Schrader and Kyle Busch, who not only saw his speed, but also his innate ability to get more of it when he needed it. \n\"First off, he has tremendous feedback for what he feels the car is doing to be able to tell the crew so they can make it better,'' Schrader told The Plain Dealer in 2015. \nWhile the sport is so technology driven now with computer readouts and such, the human element to make an adjustment in that search for an extra 10th worth of speed can be the difference between winning and losing. \n\"That's one of the biggest qualities you need, to be able to tell what you need to go faster,'' Schrader said of Tifft. \"He's got real good feedback. And he's just (naturally) fast.'' \nIn his first NASCAR Truck race ins 2014, Tifft finished an impressive eighth. By 2015 he had his first trial in an Xfinity Series race, behind the wheel for Joe Gibbs, and finished 10th. Driving both trucks and selected Xfinity races in 2016, Tifft encountered some adversity. \nHe suffered a back injury, and while recovering from that it was discovered he had a benign tumor on the brain. After it was removed in July, and more rehab, Tifft was cleared to drive again by the end of last season. And he was soon rewarded with the gig this season for JGR. \n\"It definitely goes to a different level when you're doing this full time on the Xfinity Series,'' Tifft told The Plain Dealer by phone recently during preseason testing while in Phoenix, Ariz. \"There are a lot more obligations both at the track and outside of the track.'' \nHis obligations include himself, with regular doctor checkups for his 2016 injuries. \n\"My back is totally fine,'' he said. \"I'm good to go now, especially after getting a chance to reset over the offseason. Only thing is I get (brain) checkups every eight weeks.\" \nSo his focus is exclusively on getting set for the start of the Xfinity season at Daytona. \n\"For people going for Rookie of the Year you get two test sessions,'' Tifft said. \"This (Phoenix) is our first one and we'll use our second one later in the season. That's it. \n\"We're really cut short on practice time. When we show up at Daytona we'll show up the day before (for practice), but that's all of 90 minutes before we go racing. And it will be like that every weekend. So it's pretty quick.\" \nHe will be the lone Xfinity driver for JGR this season. That was not the original plan, but veteran teammate and defending series champion Daniel Suarez moved up to a prime NASCAR seat with the team when former driver Carl Edwards recently made the surprise announcement to retire. \nSo Tifft now gets all the Xfinity attention. And taking over in a champions seat he has high expectations for the season. \n\"Our goal is to go out and win Rookie of the Year, compete for a championship, and go win a few races,'' he said. \"Get my first win out of the way and improve every week. It's a long 33-race schedule until the third week of November. It's a long schedule, but it's something I've always wanted to do and I'm ready for the challenge of it.'' \nAnother plus is he gets a chance to show how well he's doing back home. The Xfinity schedule has an annual date at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in Lexington, Ohio. It's a rare road course stop, but one Tifft looks forward too. \n\"I love the road courses,'' he said. \"I came from road courses then switched to ovals. I would love to see more of it. I think the best shows we put on are at the road courses. It's definitely a very, very different style of racing. It's funny, but we put in a lot of work for just those two races of the year on road courses right now.''
