This incident shows the complete apathy of our society towards the safety of our citizens, especially females. After the disgusting New year’s incident in Bengaluru, this latest incident have shown us that not even celebs are safe from such miscreants, who have complete disregard towards law and order. However some sections of the media have tried going overboard reporting the case, becoming a bit more insensitive with regards to the actress’ plight. \nMalayalam star Prithviraj , who has acted with Bhavana in a few movies like Swapnakoodu, Police, Robinhood, Daivanamathil and others, have wrote a bold open letter on his Facebook where he lashed at the social elements, as well as the certa sections of media who are trying to piggyride on the issue. Prithviraj also showed his awe over how bravely Bhavana has been acting after that shocking letter. \nHere’s his open letter… \n“Woke up today morning to the horrifying news that has by now been reported, misreported and sensationalised. As disturbing as it was, I refrained from saying something on what happened to one of the most beautiful girls I know because I knew whatever I or any one among our fraternity say, will only be fodder to click baits and TRP mongering. By now, all that can be said about the security of women in our “matriarchal/matrilineal” God’s own country has already been said. And yes..as a man who has to share the responsibility of a society that bears this shame, I hang my head! But please..the most we can collectively do at this moment..is to respect the guts of this girl. I was supposed to start work with her in a week, and she told me that she’d like not to come back in front of the camera so soon..and so is pulling out of the film. I know this girl..I know how brave she is…if it’s affected her enough to make her stay away from what she loves the most..I can only imagine how harrowing it must have been. Yes..please let us have an effective investigation in place and please let’s bring the bastards to justice asap..but please..let us also not allow anyone..ANYONE..to celebrate someone else’s misfortune. WITH YOU BHAVANA…will look forward to hanging with you as soon as you’re up to it..and yeah..be who you are..and don’t let today dictate the rest of your life. Love always..Prithvi. \nPS: Please spare me the “English Medium” jokes on this one. Thanks. \nSeven persons have been taken into custody in connection with the case, police said here on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T11:04:32.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
