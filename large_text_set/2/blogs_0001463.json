He was 60. \nNirmal, who was one of India’s most widely read sportswriters in a career that spanned more than three decades, joined The Hindu in 1980 and was with the institution till he retired on September 30, 2015. \nHe became The Hindu’s Sports Editor in 2003 and took independent charge of Sportstar in early 2012. In the early 1980s, Nirmal studied in the United States on a fellowship. He was part of the visiting faculty in the Asian College of Journalism at Chennai. \nNirmal became synonymous with The Hindu’s coverage of tennis, especially Wimbledon and he also reported extensively on big-ticket events like the Australian Open and Davis Cup. \nHis despatches on tennis particularly, and on sport at large, evoked the big picture, dwelling on the personalities of the sportspersons and the aesthetics of their game. His rich prose style had a legion of admirers. Many years ago, in an interview about his approach to writing, Nirmal said: “I don’t restrict myself to sports, but try and bring in a life’s perspective; try understanding the psychology of sports and fit sports into the wider context, rather than stick to the backhands and the cover drives alone!” \nAfter his retirement, he remained a columnist with The Hindu . In his last published piece on January 28, Nirmal concluded with these lines: “But the truth is, nothing may be forever – except perhaps Bradman’s Test batting average of 99.94 – immune to evolution. And, sport is no exception.” \nNirmal is survived by his mother, wife, son and daughter. His funeral will take place on Thursday afternoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:00:19.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
