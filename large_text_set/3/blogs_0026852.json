It’s what the people think. The people think that not everything was right,” billionaire Gristedes owner Catsimatidis said.\n“It just ended too abruptly.”\nNYCLASS members chanted “Keep your promise, Mayor de Blasio!” as Hizzoner walked along Central Park South to the famed Plaza Hotel.\nAfter speaking inside the iconic Oak Room for about seven minutes, the mayor emerged and was stopped in his tracks by NYCLASS director Edita Birnkrant.\nShe demanded that he live up to his vow that he’d ban carriage horses on “Day One” of his administration.\n“You know I’ve put a lot of energy out to get this done,” de Blasio said as protesters blocked his path to the Greek Independence Day parade.\n“I did not have the kind of support I was hoping for in the Council,” he said.\nSEE ALSO \nAnimal rights activists sued for 'terrorizing' carriage horses 0:0 Central Park has turned into the Wild West over the... “I have to fight for it too, and I will.

We’re going to hold him to it.”\nNYCLASS board members Wendy Neu and Steve Nislick donated at least $134,900 to de Blasio’s campaign and his since-shuttered nonprofit, the Campaign for One New York.\nProposed legislation to restrict carriage horses to Central Park died in February 2016 when the council cancelled a vote on the bill.\nA council spokeswoman said there were no plans to revive it.\nCatsimatidis, who lost the 2013 Republican primary race for mayor to Joe Lhota, said he would decide in the next few weeks whether to run for mayor again.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:04:21.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
