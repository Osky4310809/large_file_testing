Flamming | February 14, 2017 | 4:39pm Share Tweet Submit Pin \nThe first trailer for Ryan Murphy ’s Feud: Bette and Joan has been released, and it looks full of tension, tears and “full, naked rancor”—watch above. \nThe show focuses around the much-publicized rivalry between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis during the filming of the 1962 psychological thriller What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Crawford and Davis are played by Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange, respectively. \nFeud promises to be much more than a shallow drama. The eight-part series will focus on the intersection between ageism and sexism in Hollywood , and the deeper conflicts between the two women. As Olivia de Havilland, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, says in the trailer, “Feuds are never about hate. Feuds are about pain.” \nSeason one of Feud is set to air on Sunday, March 5, on FX.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:02:16.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
