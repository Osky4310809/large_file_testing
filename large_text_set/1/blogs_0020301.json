They’re the perfect snack to share over a glass of wine before dinner or as dessert. Cheese plates, which typically consist of 3-5 cheese selections as well as accompaniments that complement the cheese, such as jams, compotes, honeycomb, charcuterie, nuts and more. When I learned January 20 was National Cheese Lover’s Day, I wanted to share my favorite places to indulge in a cheese plate at Walt Disney World Resort .\nCalifornia Grill , Disney’s Contemporary Resort \nAlong with stellar views, California Grill offers a deliciously sophisticated cheese plate. Their current selection includes Barely Buzzed, an espresso and lavender hand-rubbed cheese with notes of butterscotch and caramel with a smooth, creamy texture; Moses Sleeper, a creamy, buttery, bright and savory cow’s milk cheese; Truffle Tremor, a bloomy-rind black truffle goat cheese; Moliterno, a firm, Italian sheep’s milk cheese; Oregon Blue, a semi-soft, raw milk blue cheese.\nMartha’s Vineyard , Disney’s Beach Club Resort \nTucked away in Disney’s Beach Club Resort, this hidden gem lounge has a number of delicious bites, such as lump crab cake and sautéed mussels. However, my favorite thing to order is the artisan cheese plate, which features Cabot Cheddar, a mildly sharp, firm cow cheese paired with pear pâté de fuit; Wensleydale with Cranberries, an English cheese made of both cow and sheep milk paired with spiced candied walnuts and Fourme D’ambert, a semi-hard blue cheese made from cow’s milk paired with Savannah Bee Company honeycomb.\n\nTrattoria al Forno , Disney’s BoardWalk \nWho says you can’t have cheese for breakfast? At Trattoria al Forno, you can order a breakfast entrée which features Pecorino cheese as well as a soft fonduta made of Mozzarella (which is hand-pulled in house) with delicious cured Italian meats, tomatoes and hard-boiled eggs.\nCítricos , Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa \nThe current cheese lineup at Cítricos includes Red Hawk triple cream brie made from organic cow’s milk, aged for weeks; Humbolt Fog goat cheese, which has a subtle tangy flavor and visible layers of edible vegetable ash; Cabot Clothbound, a complex sweet-savory balanced cheddar cheese and Fourme D’ambert, a semi-hard blue cheese made from cow’s milk. The cheeses are accompanied by pickled vegetables, lemon-thyme cake, seasonal compote and honey. Tip – the same cheese board is also available in the Cítricos Lounge and Mizner’s Lounge!\nFlying Fish , Disney’s BoardWalk \nThe recently reimagined Flying Fish is a fabulous date night restaurant and home to a delicious artisanal cheese plate featuring Mt Tam, a smooth, creamy triple-cream made with organic milk, firm yet buttery; San Joaquin Gold, a firm Cheddar-like cheese, with a firm and granular texture; Truffle Tremor, a bloomy-rind black truffle goat cheese; San Andreas, a sheep’s milk cheese with a smooth, creamy mildly sour finish; Point Reyes Toma, a buttery semi-hard farmstead cheese made with cow’s milk.\nRemember, cheeses as well as their accompaniments tend to change frequently, especially as the seasons change.
