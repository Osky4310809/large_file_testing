ADVERTISEMENT \nHe said all the cultural agencies such as the KWF, National Museum, National Library, among others would be put under the supervision of this department which would harmonize the different functions of these bodies to avoid repetition of duties. \n“First of all, we need a body which can organize and supervise cultural activities throughout the country,” Almario said. \n“We need a body to harmonize all the cultural agencies,” he added. \nHe added that a creation of a department to supervise all cultural bodies would also rule out the need of an arbitration in cases of dispute between two directors of the agencies. \nIn relation to the advocacy of promoting translation as a practice and as a field of study, Almario said a Bureau of Translation would be placed in the department to institutionalize the need to translate the country’s literary works from 131 different languages to Filipino, and vice versa. \nHe touted the role of translation into the Filipino language to promote nation-building. \n“Ang ating layunin ngayong umaga ay hindi lamang tungkol sa pagbabalita tungkol sa international conference, kundi kayo mismo ay maging bahagi ng ating kampanya para mamulat hindi lamang ang taumbayan kundi lalo na ang ating mga lider na kailangan natin ng translation para mas magkaisa ang mga Filipino,” Almario said. \n(Our purpose this morning is not only to report about the international conference, but also for the media to be part of our campaign to enlighten our citizens and our leaders about the need for translation to unity all Filipinos.) \nAlmario said there are bills to create a Department of Culture already pending in the Senate. \nHe said his role in the NCCA would be to protect not only the heritage buildings but also the “non-tangible heritage” of the country such as language and literature.
