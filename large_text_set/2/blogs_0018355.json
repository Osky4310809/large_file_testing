Cohen, who died aged 70, also begged America to think twice about voting for Trump.\nHis obituary, published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , described Cohen as a chiropractor with a love of family and cowboy culture whose patients included Liza Minnelli, ‘Weird Al’ Yankovic and the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nIt ended with a final request: “Jeffrey would ask that in lieu of flowers, please do not vote for Donald Trump.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on News.com.au .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:05:03.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
