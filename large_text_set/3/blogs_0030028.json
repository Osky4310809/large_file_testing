I don't know what the process is,\" he said. \"At the moment I'm going fishing for a couple of weeks, so it's the last of my worries at the moment. It's out of my control - what happens, happens. When I get back home I'll select a squad for England, prepare the side well for when we get to England, play in England, and take it from there and see what happens.\" \nAsked if he wanted to remain in his position, Domingo replied: \"I don't know. I suppose everybody wants to coach the national side. That's where you want to coach, I suppose. I've loved my four years but if my four years are up, so be it. I've had some wonderful results, I've had some disappointments. But that's part of international sport. I haven't looked that far ahead. All my focus is on England and the Champions Trophy. What happens after that is not in my control. \n\"I'm still waiting to find out what I need to do, or if I need to do anything. Once we've got clarity on that I'll make some decisions.\" \nAlthough Domingo was in charge when South Africa went through a slump in the 2015-16 season, when they lost Test series in India and at home to England and dropped to seventh in the rankings, he has also overseen their rebuilding process over the past 14 months. With a reshuffled side, a new captain and a more open environment, they have won seven of 11 Tests since August, losing just once, and have also moved to the top of the ODI rankings with a string of impressive results. \n\"Beside this last year we've had some unbelievable success,\" said Domingo. \"Winning in Sri Lanka, against Pakistan in Dubai, winning a one-day series in India - the side's done some amazing things. We've been consistent these last nine months. The last couple of weeks and the last couple of games are always fresher in the mind but when you sit back and think, the side's been pretty decent for a long period of time bar one or two poor tours. I've really enjoyed it.\" \nDespite their recent success, South Africa have some difficult questions ahead of the Test series in England. While the bowling looks well stocked, the poor form of Stephen Cook and JP Duminy in New Zealand has left the Test futures of both players hanging in the balance. Domingo suggested that he would prefer to see them kept on and revived than jettisoned in favour of new blood. \n\"There are some challenges, there's no doubt about it, particularly with a big Test series looming in England. We've got some work to do,\" he admitted. \"I need to sit down with the selection panel and plot our way forward. We've got some quality in our batting line-up, but it's a matter of getting them confident and getting them playing well again. All of the batsmen have put in wonderful performances over the last couple of years. We need to get them back into that space.\" © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T11:08:34.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
