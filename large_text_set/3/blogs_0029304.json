Twenty-four of the league’s 32 owners must vote in favor of the relocation for it to be approved. \nIt’d be the latest relocation for the league. On Jan. 12, the Chargers moved from San Diego to Los Angeles. The Rams moved from St. Louis to L.A. last year. \nGoodell’s full letter has not been published in its entirety at this time, but its largest passage reads as follows, per the East Bay Times: \n“We have been prepared for nearly two years to work on finding a solution based on access to land at a certain cost, without constraints on the location of the stadium or timing of construction, and clarity on the overall development,” Goodell wrote. \n“However, at this date, there remains no certainty regarding how the site will be fully developed, or the specific and contractually-defined nature of the participation by Fortress or other parties. In addition, the long-term nature of the commitment to the A’s remains a significant complication and the resolution of that issue remains unknown.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T03:27:04.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
