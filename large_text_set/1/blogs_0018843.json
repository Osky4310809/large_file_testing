The Football Whispers Index takes the latest transfer rumours and gives them a score out of five; the higher the score, the more realistic and reliable the whisper. \nHere are today's top five emerging whispers. And keep an eye on Transfer Talk for all the latest gossip. \nThibaut Courtois to Real Madrid \nChelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is now reportedly the top target for La Liga leaders Real Madrid. Zinedine Zidane's men have given up in the pursuit of David De Gea and instead turned their attention towards the Chelsea No. 1. The Belgian's family still live in Madrid following his loan spell with Atletico and it's been reported he's desperate to return back to the Spanish capital. The Daily Mirror believe Real Madrid are prepared to pay as much as £26 million for the 24-year-old. \nSteven Nzonzi to Juventus \nEl Mundo Deportivo claim Juventus are the favourites to land €30m-rated Sevilla midfielder Steven Nzonzi. According to the report, Juventus have dropped their interest in Lyon's versatile midfielder Corentin Tolisso and will now put all of their efforts into securing the former Stoke man. It was reported that Barcelona wanted to sign the Frenchman as an alternative to Sergio Busquets but that's now changed with Luis Enrique using Sergi Roberto in that role. \nMoise Kean to Man City \nAccording to the Daily Star, Manchester City are stepping up their interest in Juventus' latest wonderkid Moise Kean. The 16-year-old is being tracked by some of Europe's elite clubs and the fact that his agent is Mino Raiola means a big money move is always on the cards. A bid of £10m with clauses included may be enough to convince Juventus to sell. Manchester City already have an abundance of attacking young talent but that doesn't look like it will prevent them from making a move for Kean. \nRachid Ghezzal to Arsenal \nAccording to French news site Foot Mercato, Arsenal are battling it out with Atletico Madrid, Valencia, Everton and AC Milan for the signature of Lyon attacking midfielder Rachid Ghezzal. The Algerian, who is away at the African Nations Cup, has just six months remaining on his current deal and Lyon are reportedly desperate to tie him down for longer to ensure they receive a fair fee if he does leave. The fact Arsene Wenger is interested, however, may be enough to convince the French born winger to choose Arsenal. \nOliver Burke to Middlesbrough \nRB Leipzig paid £13m to secure the services of Oliver Burke in the summer but the Scotsman has made just the one start in the Bundesliga. The lack of game time has led to both his club and his agent looking at a loan move. Crystal Palace and Boro are reported to be keen on the player with the latter looking to bring in reinforcements if Gaston Ramirez's move to Leicester City is finalised. It may be a short-term deal which suits all parties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T13:16:51.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
