Faith is the opposite of doubt. \nWebster's New World College Dictionary defines faith as \"unquestioning belief that does not require proof or evidence; unquestioning belief in God, religious tenets.\" How Does the Bible Define Faith? \nFaith is possibly the single-most important element in the Christian life. Let's looks at passages in the Bible that speak of faith: \nHebrews 11:6 states, \"And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.\" (NIV) \nFaith, then, is key to pleasing God . We need faith first to come to God—to believe he exists and to trust him for our salvation . Then, our continued faith—the kind that causes us to seek him daily—offers the promise of a dynamic, rewarding walk with God. Faith and the Christian Life \nThe Bible gives this description of faith in Hebrews 11:1: \"Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.\" (NIV) \nHebrews chapter 11 is often called the \"Faith Hall of Fame .\" In this notable passage, the writer of Hebrews introduces an impressive list of heroic characters from the Old Testament. These men and women and their stories stand out to encourage and challenge our faith. \nSome of the heroes are well-known Bible personalities, while others remain anonymous. Like the 12 disciples , they were ordinary people, just like you and me. They became heroes of faith by overcoming their doubts and putting their trust wholly in God. \nThe same holds true today. By trusting wholly in God through faith in Jesus Christ , believers are saved from God's judgment of sin and its consequence. By faith through God's grace , Christians are forgiven. We receive the gift of salvation by faith in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ . And then, by God's grace, we go on to become heroes of faith by following the Lord into ever greater adventures in faith . God Is the Source of Faith \nHowever, we can't take credit for our faith. Scripture explains that the source of faith is God: \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works , so that no one can boast.\" (Ephesians 2:8-9, NIV) Mustard Seed Faith \nWhen the disciples were unable to heal a man with a demon, they asked Jesus, \"'Why couldn’t we drive it out?' He replied, 'Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.'\" (Matthew 17:19-20, NIV) Faith Comes By Hearing \nSo how can build up our faith? Faith comes through hearing the Word of God: \"For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us? ' So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.\" (Romans 10:16-17, ESV ) Meditations About Faith:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:58:15.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
