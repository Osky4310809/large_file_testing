Officials said the rabbits were sick and injured because Trec neglected them and kept them in squalid conditions. \nTrec is also barred from owning any animals for five years, and she must register as an animal abuser with the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Probation authorities can search Trec's property at any time to make sure she doesn't acquire any new creatures, according to the terms of the sentence. \nTrec must also undergo mental health treatment, a spokesman for the DA's office said. \nRabbit owners who've been following Trec's case attended Friday's sentencing and said they were glad to see her finally pay for her crimes, but they would have preferred a stiffer sentence. \nTiffanie Fisher, one of the animal advocates who watched as Trec was led away in handcuffs, said a lifetime ban on Trec owning animals would be more appropriate, especially because Trec continued to amass rabbits even as she was on trial for animal cruelty. \nAuthorities seized 45 rabbits from Trec's possession in December, but Trec vowed to continue to grow her herd. \nFearing that even more animals were in danger even with Trec behind bars, Fisher and other bunny defenders visited the Third Avenue tire shop on Saturday and found dozens of rabbits in need of care. \nArmed with lettuce and hay, the rabbit advocates expected to find a handful of rabbits still on the property, but quickly counted at least 30. Advocates examined the left-behind bunnies and found that at least eight had injuries such as bites. \nOne was a \"gorgeous\" black and white checkered giant — a breed of rabbit — that was cowering in the corner of a hutch filled with garbage, Fisher said. The hutch was latched shut and it wasn't clear how long the rabbit had been alone inside, she said. \nFisher and other volunteers took the injured rabbits to Animal Care Centers of NYC. A spokeswoman for ACC said the agency already has more than 40 of Trec's former pets in its care and is awaiting direction from the Brooklyn District Attorney's office on what to do with the others that remain behind the tire shop. \nThe ASPCA is planning two special adoption events next month for former Trec rabbits and their offspring, a spokeswoman said. The agency has not been contacted by the NYPD about whether to go take the remaining rabbits from behind the tire shop, an ASPCA spokeswoman said. \nFisher said the clock is ticking on Trec's abandoned rabbits, because they don't appear to be spayed or neutered. \n“The urgency is, every day that passes is another day that increases their chances of breeding,” Fisher said. “In 30 days, 20 rabbits turns into 50 rabbits.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:24:02.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
