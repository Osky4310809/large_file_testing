The retailer and brand came together to produce a limited capsule celebrating authenticity, self-expression, and individual style. The collection, which features outerwear, accessories, bottoms, and naturally sneakers, carries an overall utilitarian aesthetic, with baggy overalls, khaki jumpsuits, camo and m-65 jackets. The traditional Vans checker pattern and Off the Wall logo are used liberally throughout.\nThe campaign is fronted by Sasha Lane, who has become a breakout star following last summerâ€™s critical darling American Honey . The campaign, which features images of Lane shot by photographer RJ Shaunessey, captures the freedom, femininity, and bold sense of self that Lane embodies oh so well.\nThe collection is available now at select Urban Outfitters locations as well as online.\nBuy Now ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:02:43.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
