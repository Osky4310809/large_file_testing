By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 17, 2017 3:56 PM Mani Shankar Aiyar stated that it would be surprising if someone stands against Rahul Gandhi and win to lead the party. (PTI) \nA day after making big claims stating that Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is being ‘blocked from doing what he wants’, senior party leader Mani Shankar Aiyar today said that election should be at every level, even for the presidency of the Congress party. The former diplomat further stated that it would be surprising if someone stands against Rahul Gandhi and win to lead the party. \nEarlier yesterday, the leader, who had earlier called for a change in the party leadership, said that the leader will ‘do things his way’ when he’ll become the party president. Aiyar, who served as senior cabinet minister in UPA Government, made his remarks in an interview with India Today TV. Speaking on the 2019 general elections, Aiyar said that a bigger alliance will be required to take on challenged posed by PM Narendra Modi . “Joining a bigger alliance is the best & most assured way to defeat PM Narendra Modi,” Aiyar said. The former cabinet minister denied the claims of Muslims voting for PM Narendra Modi. “Muslims didn’t vote for PM Narendra Modi, they voted for a series of parties,” Aiyar said. \nAlso Watch: \nAlso claiming that a change of leadership is required in the Congress party, Aiyar, as quoted by ANI, said, “Our position in national politics is shrinking…there is a need to bring change in the Congress leadership. The general secretaries need to be the young people and the old experienced people should be in the Congress working committee.” \nAiyar isn’t the only one to speak up against the Congress leadership. Criticism of the Congress leadership has intensified after the party was crushed in the Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh elections, and failed to form the government in Goa and Manipur despite emerging as the single-largest party.
