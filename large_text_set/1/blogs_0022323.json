their paces 23 Jan 2017 15 hours /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/AFL/News/ FORMER captain Gary Ablett has been left out of the Gold Coast Suns’ new-look leadership group for the 2017 AFL season. \nAblett, who relinquished the Suns’ skipper role late last year after it was revealed his shock trade request back to Geelong had been denied by Gold Coast, is one of five exclusions from last year’s leadership group. \nJarrod Harbrow won’t be part of the group this season, while Nick Malceski (retired), Dion Prestia (Richmond) and Jaeger O’Meara (Hawthorn) have left the club in a playing capacity. \nThey have been replaced by Fremantle recruit Michael Barlow and emerging midfielder Touk Miller to form a seven-man player-voted leadership group that also includes co-captains Tom Lynch and Steven May, as well as Michael Rischitelli, Matt Rosa and David Swallow. \nAblett recently indicated that he wanted to concentrate on returning to full fitness in 2017 following two-and-a-half seasons plagued by knee and shoulder injuries. \nBut the bolter of this year’s leadership group is Barlow, who fell out of favour at the Dockers and was delisted at the end of 2016. \nThe veteran on-baller has made an immediate impact at the Suns since they gave him lifeline by recruiting him as a free agent. \nSuns coach Rodney Eade said Lynch and May would be supported by a “strong group of leaders”. \nHe also paid tribute to Barlow, who has been an excellent role model for the club’s younger brigade of players. \n“Similar to Matty Rosa last year, Michael Barlow has made an immediate impact on the playing group, leading by example on and off the field and his elevation to the player leadership group demonstrates the influence he has had on the team in a relatively short period of time,” Eade said. \nEade paid tribute to the other new member in Miller, whose steady rise has seen him gain respect both inside and outside the club. \n“Touk has been an influential member in our emerging leadership program since joining the club and this has been recognised by the players, resulting in him being voted into the leadership group,” Eade said. \n“He has grown and developed as a person, player and leader and we believe Touk will benefit enormously from being part of the leadership group in 2017.” More Local News", "external_links": [], "published":
