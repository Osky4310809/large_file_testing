He was backed in his claim by the importers who linked the vehicle to Oando Plc. \nSaraki’s testimony, nevertheless, set the stage for another showdown between the Senate and the Comptroller-General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (retd) who was summoned to appear today to give the Customs version of the events. Ali had, last week, gone to court to seek protection from appearing before the Senate in mufti. \nAlso, yesterday, the Vice-Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Prof. Ibrahim Garba, confirmed that Senator Melaye graduated with a third class degree from the university in year 2000. They all spoke at the investigative hearing conducted by the Senate Committee on Ethics and Public Petitions at the Senate building in Abuja. \nThe hearing was upon two pleas by erstwhile Senate Leader, Senator Ali Ndume for an investigation of the role played by Saraki in the importation of the vehicle. He had during the Senate plenary, last Tuesday, expressed concern that the Senate face-off with Customs boss, Col. Ali may have flowed from the confiscation of the SUV, which some news reports had claimed was imported by Senator Saraki. \nAt the end of yesterday’s hearing, Senator Ndume expressed satisfaction, but said he had no regrets bringing up the issue to the attention of the Senate. \nSaraki was led into the venue of the hearing in Room 120, Senate New Building, by Senators Philip Aduda (PDP, FCT); Mohammed Hassan (PDP, Yobe South); Dino Melaye (APC, Kogi West) and John Enoh (PDP, Cross River Central). \nResponding to questions on what he knew about the vehicle, Saraki said: \n“Most of the questions come to a basic issue. I am not an importer and at no point did I import an SUV Range Rover. As you know, this is a vehicle that is not a personal vehicle. It is a vehicle which was processed through the National Assembly. \n“I don’t know anything about the importation, I did not appoint any clearing agent or anything like that. Most of the vehicles that are here, you only know when it is delivered to you. None of this did I import or get any agent. \n“We all know that all treated vehicles have end-user certificates and there it states clearly who the importer is and these documents are available and there is no document anywhere that shows my name.” \nNoting that the Senate resolution against the confiscation of already registered vehicles by the Customs was an altruistic move to protect the citizenry, he said: \n“We all raised the issue of the policy that it is anti-people. This policy really had no value at all and that was why this motion came up and we debated it in the interest of Nigerians, but unfortunately those who want to fight back, went and thought there was something to blackmail us with. \n“I am not an importer and I know the documents you have will show clearly that it has nothing to do with me.” \nThe importer \nThe importer of the car, Tokunbo Akindele, said it was imported on behalf of Oando Plc in 2015. \nHe denied allegations that Saraki had any link with the car. \nAccording to him, the car was imported by the company for the various operations it had around the country. \nHe also explained that “at no point did we submit any fake document for the clearing of the car. \n“We followed all due processes in terms of payment to the company which handled the entire process for us. \n“In 2015, on behalf of the firm that I work for, Oando PLC, we imported a Range Rover Bullet Proof SUV vehicle. \n“We imported it as the company that needed to use it for the various operations that we have around the country. \n“The car took longer than was expected and by the time it reached Nigeria in September 2015, we decided that we will no longer be using the car, so we effectively parked it. \n“We mandated a company offshore to buy the car, armour the car, ship the car, clear the car with Customs and just deliver the car to us as a full-fledged service. \n“We received the car in September 2015 assuming that all of these things were done. \n“All payments were made for the acquisition, the armouring, the shipping as well as the clearing of which we have necessary evidence.’ \n“The vehicle was not to be used by Sen. Bukola Saraki, it was not imported or acquired for his use at the time the vehicle came into the country. \n“The National Assembly took receipt of the car through a consignment from us, through Lanre Shittu Motors in December 2015. \nHe said the car was in the country for two months and with no use, adding that it was at that point that Oando released it to Lanre Shittu on consignment who sold it to the National Assembly. \nMeanwhile, the Committee has summoned the Nigeria Customs Service, NCS to appear before it today to explain the side of the story. \nOn Dino Melaye \nEarlier, Prof. Garba, vice-chancellor of ABU when asked to speak on what he knows of Senator Melaye said: “From the records I know, Senator Dino Melaye, who was formerly known as Jonah Daniel Melaye as former student of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and I know him to be the distinguished Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” \n“From the records of Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, Distinguished Senator Dino Melaye, who was at that time named Daniel Jonah Melaye, graduated with a third class degree of the Bachelors of Art in Geography in the year 2000. And by this, he is a graduate of the university. \n“In my honour, I reaffirm that Senator Dino Melaye graduated as Daniel Jonah Melaye during the third semester of the 1998/1999 academic session with a 3rd Class Degree in Geography, that is Bachelors of Arts in Geography.” \nEarlier, Senator Melaye had tendered some documents to the committee, including offer of admission, acceptance of offer by the university, Statement of Result issued upon graduation from the university as well as the NYSC certificate. \nMelaye in his testimony, said: “I also want to state with every sense of responsibility that I am a graduate of Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. \n“I gained admission with an offer of admission on the September 6, 1994 and the admission was to study Bachelor of Arts (Geography) and a copy of that admission letter will be tendered. \n“I also have a second document to tender, my acceptance offer by the university. I also have the third document to tender which is my result from the Ahmadu Bello University certifying me a graduate of the school. \n“I also have here a document for my registration that I tendered where I have C5 in CRS, A3 in Agric, C6 in Economics, C6 in Geography, C6 in Biology and a credit in English. I will also tender that as evidence. After my graduation, the school sent my name to the NYSC for the mandatory Service and I participated in the one year NYSC. \n“I served in Police College Kaduna and by the grace of God, that year I won the National Prize of the DG and it is on record and verifiable and I beg to tender my discharge certificate from NYSC.” \nOn the discrepancy between his present name and his certificates, he said: “My name as an undergraduate was Daniel Jonah Melaye. Jonah is actually my father’s name, so that is what I have on my university certificate. But Because I am now popularly known as Dino, I applied to the court and asked that I needed an affidavit for change of name before my admission and I submitted it to ABU. I will tender my Identity cards and I came here with a copy of my final year project duly signed by my head of department in the Faculty of Arts as it was then called.” \nThe controversy \nSenator Ali Ndume, who brought the issues to the Senate, however, raised a stir when he said Melaye did his NYSC scheme in 1999, a year before his graduation. \nHis assertion was immediately dismissed by Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, PDP, Delta North, who pointed out that contrary to Ndume’s claims, and going by documents submitted to the panel, Melaye did his service from July 9, 2000 to July 8, 2001. \nAsked by Senator Matthew Urhoghide, PDP, Edo South, if he was convinced by the authenticity of the documents submitted by the respondent, Ndume said he would rather maintain status quo ante , adding, “I have no personal interest for this, I only have an interest which is to protect the institution of the National Assembly. What I did was to bring this matter to the senate because of the raging controversy stirred.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:48:02.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
