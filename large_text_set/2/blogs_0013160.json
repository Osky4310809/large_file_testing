Gwen Stefani had to rethink her relationship with Blake Shelton when they went to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, in October. She joked about their visit — and what Shelton refused to do that made her question if they were right for each other — during an appearance on The Tonight Show on Wednesday, February 15. Before They Were on The Voice! \"I know that for me, I just go anywhere, and I know I'm gonna get hounded for pictures or whatever. … He's in the woods most of the time but, yeah, we went. It was crazy. It was, like, a billion people there,\" Stefani, 47, recalled to host Jimmy Fallon . \"He [wouldn't] do the roller coasters. That was literally, like, that was almost a deal breaker for me.

She shared photos on social media, and Shelton wore a \"1st Visit\" button on his shirt.

It was like the whole world had just watched it, and we walked in the room. I felt so bad. He really is a country boy,\" Stefani told Fallon. \"I think he’s quite miserable when he’s not in the woods or, like, somewhere in camo. He really likes to be camouflaged.\" \nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!
