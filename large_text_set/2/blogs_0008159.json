Billions of dollars are poured into the construction of world-class facilities to host the Olympics. However, after the games end, finding a purpose for those facilities can be a challenge.\nThe Olympic stages in Rio are much different from before the world left them six months ago. The area which once stood the center of attention across the globe is now barren, torn up, picked apart, empty, and sad looking.\nSearching around Rio's empty Maracana stadium for the Olympic Rings.

Chairs were stolen and thrown in heaps at Maracanã Stadium, which hosted the men’s and women’s soccer tournaments.\nHundreds of seats ripped out of Maracana and dumped by vandals in bowels of famous stadium. pic.twitter.com/w9d77EdSDD \n— Stephen Wade (@StephenWadeAP) February 10, 2017 Nobody walks through the one-time highly coveted areas anymore. The place is completely deserted, having lived through its one-month life span.\nThe abandoned Olympic Park in Rio, 6 months after games. Like an empty shopping mall. No stores, no customers. pic.twitter.com/cDLWcJHSLE \n— Stephen Wade (@StephenWadeAP) February 10, 2017 The Olympic Village is no more, fenced in without purpose.\nHere's the fenced-off Olympic Village where 10,000 Olympians stayed. Vacant 6 months after games. pic.twitter.com/30XCFIb7ju \n— Stephen Wade (@StephenWadeAP) February 10, 2017 As Rodger Sherman explained Brazil’s economic state best before he left to cover the Olympic events:\nThe reason things are broken everywhere is because Brazil did not have the money to spend billions of dollars on constructing things, leading to rushed, shoddily done buildings.\nThey spent billions on a velodrome and a canoe slalom course and an Olympic stadium and a field hockey stadium and expanding the airport. Meanwhile, they can’t afford to pay police and firefighters or get the poop out of the water.\nBrazil’s economy has tanked in the last five years , to the point it couldn’t afford to pay its regular bills. Hosting the Olympics was like buying a yacht when Brazil couldn’t make its car payments.\nI’m not worried about how everything in Brazil seems to be broken. But the Olympics will guarantee that things in Brazil stay broken for some time, and the country’s people will have to live with that long after I leave my uncomfortable hotel room.\nThe entire venue has been abandoned, and it appears Rodger’s fears have come to fruition.\n(H/T the Guardian) \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:01:45.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
