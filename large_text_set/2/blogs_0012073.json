The aura of invincibility cloaking Real Madrid in the first half of the season has been stripped away and it is the visitors who go into the game buoyed by a formidable run. \nMaurizio Sarri's side are unbeaten in their past 18 matches in all competitions stretching back to a 2-1 loss against Juventus in Turin last October. That has been achieved despite losing Gonzalo Higuain to the Old Lady last summer and the absence of his direct replacement, Arkadiusz Milik, who has been out for four months with a knee injury. \nIn the Poland international's stead, Sarri has turned Dries Mertens into a prolific goalscorer. The Belgium international has banged in 13 goals in his past 10 appearances and 20 overall this season, including four in the Champions League. In Serie A, the diminutive winger, who filled in as a striker for the Azzurri just once in 2015-16, is two goals shy of Higuain and Edin Dzeko in the hunt for the C apocannoniere award for the league's highest scorer. \nBoth Mertens and Napoli's talismanic captain Marek Hamsik were spared the final 20 minutes of the 2-0 victory over Genoa last weekend with the Bernabeu in mind, but there is much more to Sarri's side than a pair of proven match-winners. Napoli's squad is brimming with individual talent. A solid foundation at the back between former Real defender Raul Albiol and Kalidou Koulibaly is complemented by marauding full-backs Elseid Hysaj and Faouzi Ghoulam and a midfield featuring the in-demand Piotr Zielinski, Italy international Lorenzo Insigne and Hamsik, who has a penchant for stunning strikes . \nZidane is under no illusions about the task facing his side across the two legs as Real Madrid attempt to successfully defend the Champions League for the first time since the current format was introduced in 1992. Benzema hasn't done much to warrant Zidane's faith in him, but he'll likely be in the XI against Napoli with Bale still out. \nSaid the former Real Madrid player turned manager : \"They have good players, good movement, a lot of intensity. Players who are technically very good. They have a lot of penetration, they're very quick, intense. How can we counteract that? Concentration. It's a question of concentration. We're going to have to dig in at times. And what also most interests me is what we then do in attack.\" \nZidane elected not to risk Gareth Bale for the opening leg with the Wales forward returning to full training just a few days ago and will look to Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo to provide the cutting edge. Of his under-fire striker, Zidane stressed that Benzema \"helps the others to score and helps them to play better.\" There has been scant evidence of that in recent weeks but Benzema does have a habit of rising to the big occasion. \nOther than Bale, Zidane has no injury concerns and will doubtless revert to his tried and tested 4-3-3 in the Bernabeu, a formation that he strayed from twice during his first 10 months in charge but has perhaps been too willing to discard in recent weeks with the shop floor a little bare. Dani Carvajal and Marcelo are both available and the Real boss has his first-choice midfield of Luka Modric, Casemiro and Toni Kroos ready to contest the key battleground. \nIn another bit of good timing for Zidane, Navas was at his athletic best against Osasuna in denying Sergio Leon with a pair of wonderful saves. The Osasuna striker is not Mertens or Hamsik, but Navas will have regained some confidence from the whack of ball on glove last weekend. Zidane said a clean sheet is imperative ahead of the return leg at a raucous San Paolo. \nThat might be too much to expect against a side who have hammered in 44 goals during their 18-game streak: Madrid have managed just eight shutouts all season. Little wonder then that Zidane is banking on his forward line playing a decisive role in the opener. \nRob Train covers Real Madrid and the Spanish national team for ESPN FC.
