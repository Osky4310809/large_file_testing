In 1972, the 968.9-carat Star of Sierra Leone was found by miners and sold for about $2.5 million.\nIt is believed to be the 13th-largest uncut diamond ever to be pulled from the ground, industry analysts say.\nMomoh told The Associated Press that he turned in the diamond because he was touched by the development being undertaken in Kono District, where the gem was found. He cited road construction and improvements to electricity after almost 30 years of blackouts.\n“I believe the government can do more, especially at a time when the country is undergoing some economic challenges,” he said.\nSLBC via AP The value of this 706-carat diamond found by a pastor in Sierra Leone has not yet been determined. Sierra Leone’s diamond wealth fuelled a decade-long civil war that ended in 2002. Despite its mineral wealth, the country remains one of the poorest in the world.\nIt was not immediately clear how the pastor came across the diamond.\nThe president praised Momoh “for not smuggling the diamond out of the country,” and encouraged others to emulate the pastor’s example. He promised the diamond would be sold to the highest bidder and whatever is due to the owner and government would be distributed accordingly.\n“A gift from God, and it will be a terrible thing if anyone tries to do something criminal with it,” the president said.\nSpokesman Bayraytay said the diamond has not yet been valued and has been placed in the Bank of Sierra Leone.\nThe president has given “clear instruction to the Ministry of Mines that the evaluation, sale and distribution of the proceeds must be done in the most transparent manner,” he said.\n– With files from The Daily Telegraph \nRelated Biggest diamond in more than a century fails to sell after auction falls flat Freakish fluke that 187-carat diamond pulled from Canada’s Arctic ice was ever found Canadian miner sells world’s most expensive rough diamond for record $63 million ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T04:44:34.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
