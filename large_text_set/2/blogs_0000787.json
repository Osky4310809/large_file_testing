Several times, Barkley admitted that he has “done some stupid things” in his life, after James had dragged those things back up in his retort. \nBarkley has a long history of criticizing James over the past decade, but he emphasized on the show how he has never made it personal. Here’s what Barkley said.\nCharles Barkley responds to LeBron James' recent comments. pic.twitter.com/tJQYQzF3Bs \n— NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 3, 2017 “No. 1, I have no problem with what LeBron said. I have no problem. Everything’s not true, but most of that is true. I’ve done some stupid things in my life. That being said, I have never — I’ve been doing this job for 15, 16 years. I have never said anything personal about the guy and I am never going to. Ever. All my criticism of any player or comments on any team is strictly about basketball.\n“What I said was if I’m the best player in the world, which he is, he has Kyrie Irving who’s an All-Star, he has Kevin Love who’s an All-Star, he has Tristan Thompson who’s a terrific player, I take my chances against anybody. I don’t need any help if I got those guys. That would be my personal opinion. I stick by that. Him saying they’re top heavy? Everybody — I’m pretty sure Carmelo would take those three guys. I’m pretty sure Russell Westbrook would take those three guys. But, like I say, I’m never going to get personal. It’s been fun to me, listening and watching. I play golf the last two days and people left me a bunch of messages on my jackass phone. I have two phones, I have a private cell and I have my jackass phone for the rest of the people. My jackass phone has been blowing up. Thank God I don’t keep it with me, but like I say, LeBron is one of the 10 greatest players I’ve ever seen. He’s an amazing man. What him and his guys have done business wise is amazing. But my comments were what I said, I stick by them, but I’m never going to say something personal about another NBA player.”\nAsked if he took exception to the comments: “Do I take exception to it? Ernie, I’ve done some stupid things in my life. I have to live with that. I didn’t — when you say stuff, in our position, when you say stuff, people gonna come back at you. Like I said, every day, my friends, I have great friends. No. 1, I flunked Spanish in high school, and I lost Jeopardy to Martha Stewart. He left off a couple things I had done wrong in my life. But like I said, I did some stupid things in my life. That does not make my argument less valid. Like I say, I’m pretty sure Carmelo Anthony is a hell of a player and would love to have Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving and Tristan Thompson. Same thing with Russell Westbrook. But my argument with LeBron was strictly basketball related.”\nBarkley also said he felt no need to respond with his own criticisms of James and that the ‘beef’ was over.\n\"It's done.\" pic.twitter.com/sT4lc539a7 \n— NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 3, 2017 On the TNT set, Shaquille O’Neal said he would have done the same thing as James if Barkley had criticized him like that. It led to a brief-but-terse moment on live television.\nShaq and Charles Barkley gotta go and fight each other already pic.twitter.com/Fgcl0haFhr \n— gifdsports (@gifdsports) February 3, 2017 The comments from Barkley that set James off included him saying he was “inappropriate, whiny, all of the above.” While the Cavaliers have the highest payroll in the NBA, James (accurately) said the team needed a playmaker and expressed frustration that he was constantly shouldering the load as a backup point guard when Kyrie Irving was off the floor.\nReplying to Barkley through ESPN, James said this.\n\"I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that. I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.\nFriends and teammates of James have unsurprisingly taken his side, with Dwyane Wade saying “thank God” that James finally said something and J.R. Smith tweeting that he thinks Barkley is jealous. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:49:07.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
