Star bartender Julia Momose is now making drinks at Oriole , the newly minted two-Michelin-starred West Loop restaurant helmed by chef Noah Sandoval, where she’s launching new non-alcoholic drinks this week and will eventually take over its entire cocktail program, according to Food & Wine . Momose left Michelin-starred GreenRiver in December . —After donating $1 million to Chicago Public Schools, Chicago’s Grammy Award-winning hip-hop artist Chance The Rapper has a new endeavor to raise money — cookies .

One dollar from each cookie’s sale goes to SocialWorks , Chance’s nonprofit for youth arts, entertainment, and civic engagement. —After it nearly closed for good — eventually closing temporarily for renovations late last year — Thai fine-dining classic Arun’s quietly reopened in February.

You can still get their addictive egg sandwiches and more at 23 N. Wacker Drive and 939 W. Randolph St. —And finally, 20 restaurants are coming together to honor Charlie Trotter and raise money for a bust in the iconic chef’s honor on April 3.
