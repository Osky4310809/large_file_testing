Andy Grant lost half of his right leg in Afghanistan, but that didn’t stop him from redefining his life after war. The UK native joined the Royal Marines when he was 17 and after 32 weeks of training, he was deployed on his first tour in Iraq in 2009, reports The Mirror . Grant was on patrol the night the explosion happened, which resulted in 27 injuries and a severed artery in his leg. \nGrant could have easily bled to death, but the medics acted quickly. After he was flown back to the base, he went through two operations before he was taken to the hospital for recovery. There, Grant was faced with a tough decision: He could try and regrow his leg or amputate it.

I couldn’t be active, I couldn’t play sports, I was in a lot of pain,” Grant told The Mirror . “The guys who’d had amputations were skiing, running, doing charity bike rides. So I decided to have the leg amputated for a better quality of life.” \nGrant didn’t regret getting his leg amputated, but he did struggle bringing himself out of the depression that followed the procedure. He got a dog to boost his mood and started taking it for walks in the morning. Those walks turned into runs, and those runs turned into races. So Grant started looking for a challenge: “I found a Canadian who lost his leg in a car accident, who could run 10k in 37 minutes and 53 seconds,” Grant said. “He was the fastest single leg amputee over 10k and I wanted to beat him.” \nGrant teamed up with a filmmaker, who wanted to create a documentary about his attempt to break the record. Once they knew he was close to his goal time, they booked a track, invited 300 friends and family members, and 37 minutes and 17 seconds later, Grant beat the record for the fastest 10k run on one leg by 36 seconds. \nThe father-of-three isn’t stopping there, either. He’s hoping to compete in the next Paralympics and has plans to climb Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the British Isles in Scotland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:42:54.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
