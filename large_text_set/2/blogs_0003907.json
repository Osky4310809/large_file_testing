He reminds me a lot of Messi,” former Everton boss Martinez told Goals on Sunday . \n“Not many players can control the moment and take a defender where you want to take him. The way he uses the ball is sensational. \n“What is surprising more than anything is his maturity. Sometimes when you watch a winger or creative player, you think the game will find you. He’s not like that. \n“I think Eden, at 26, is almost at the perfect moment in his career and the system that Chelsea plays, which is the same that we play in the national team, really gives him a new breath of life. \nKante shows what Wenger missed \n“Last season, as a Premier League manager in the opposition, you were always aware of Eden Hazard and playing left wing it was easier to stop him having one-v-one situations. Now, it’s a lot harder to get him tied down.” \nHazard has netted 10 times for Chelsea this season, while adding three efforts for Belgium in their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign.
