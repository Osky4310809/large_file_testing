Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical reported the news. ESPN's Brian Windhorst confirmed the deal. Scott, 28, has spent his entire five-year career in Atlanta. A regular fixture in the rotation for most of the last three seasons, Scott had fallen out of favor in 2016-17. He played in just 18 games, averaging 2.5 points and 2.1 rebounds on 28.8 percent shooting. The Suns will absorb Scott's $3.3 million into their cap space. Adding Scott is a bit of a curious move given the investment Phoenix has at the power forward spot. They selected Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss in the first round of last June's draft and have made a concerted effort to get both playing time, though Bender has been out of the rotation of late. Scott may help absorb some of the minutes left by P.J. Tucker, who Wojnarowski reported has been traded to the Toronto Raptors .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:04:58.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
