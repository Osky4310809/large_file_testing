Though the area is now considered to be liberated from IS, it looks like no man’s land, scorched and carpet-bombed. \nUS-backed Iraqi government forces launched a major offensive in February to recapture the western part of Mosul, where IS still controls sizeable pockets of territory. Supported by airstrikes, they are making their way through Islamic State’s major urban stronghold in Iraq, but at a horrible civilian cost. \nDespite the coalition’s repeated assurances that it is taking every precaution when carrying out its airstrikes, the fighting has badly damaged many homes, shops, and other buildings, which now bear scars inflicted by heavy weapon fire. \nThe physical appearance of civilians being driven out of their neighborhoods by Iraqi soldiers in armored vehicles and trucks provides telling evidence of what they have been through during the anti-IS operation. “Dirty clothes, dust-covered faces – the obvious signs of people who had been through too much,” Murad noted. \nNotably, evacuating civilians from the liberated areas of western Mosul is no easy task, as some important crossroads have been intentionally bombed to prevent Islamic State commanders from moving reinforcements and supplies, leaving them unpassable. Consequently, vehicles are not able to deliver medical aid or food along many of the roads. \nWalking through west Mosul, the RT crew noticed that almost every door had been kicked in and almost every shop broken into. \nGoods and possessions were seen lying in the streets, suggesting that nearby houses had been looted. “But, there’s no one left to complain,” Murad added, as his crew filmed people moving slowly down the street, apparently leaving the city. However, some residents have chosen to stay to protect their property or are simply unwilling to flee. — Murad Gazdiev (@MuradGazdiev) March 20, 2017 \nThe grim picture of devastation and suffering witnessed by RT’s crew matches the predictions of aid agencies. According to the latest estimates from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, up to 300,000 people may flee western Mosul in a fresh wave that could overwhelm the organization’s capacity to accommodate those displaced. \nIn early March, the UNHCR said about 192,000 residents had fled Mosul since October of last year, while about 750,000 still remained. Other UN figures suggest 5,000 people on average have been fleeing the city every day since the siege intensified in February.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:03:44.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
