This will be the key to their agenda. By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 21, 2017 6:06 PM Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray. (PTI) \nThe BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) polls are held in the city of Greater Mumbai. With Shiv Sena traditionally holding a strong hold in Maharashtra, the ruling-alliance BJP pitting against them in the civic polls, there could be a tough competition between them. In most likeliness, the Congress and the Raj Thackeray-led MNS might give a bit of competition but as far the results of previous BMC polls of 2012 is concerned, it looks tough for both MNS and the Congress this time. \nShiv Sena being the local party, will be relying heavily on the consolidation of Maharashtrian votes in their favour. This will be the key to their agenda. Here are the 5 key takeaways for the Uddhav Thackeray -led Shiv Sena during the BMC polls: \n→ According to party leaders; despite getting the support of Marathi people, the Shiv Sena hopes to get some percentage of North Indian, Gujarati and Muslim votes in their favour in order to touch the 100 mark. They believe that their party will emerge as the single largest party post the BMC polls. According to a legislator from suburban Mumbai, many things will depend on the polling percentage and it remains to be seen, whether the people from high-rise apartments come out to cast their votes. \n→ In a statement to The Indian Express, he told, “We feel that voters from the high-rise buildings will remain away from the voting as usual. Besides, if we get around 50 per cent of North Indian votes and a small percentage of Gujarati votes too, the Sena can reach 100 seats.” \nYou may also like to watch this video : \n→ He further added that Shiv Sena’s tally is likely to increase in the Maharashtrian-dominated areas like Dadar, Parel, Worli, Girgaun, Dindoshi, Dahisar, Bhandup and others. \n→ With the Raj Thackeray-led MNS unlikely to pose any threat, the Uddav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena may get back some of the seats that it lost in 2012. \n→ According to another Sena leader from South Mumbai, the Gujarati votes will also play a vital role in shaping out the poll results; as their votes might not help the Sena in winning any extra seat, but defeat some BJP candidates. The politician said, “The North Indian votes may either go to Congress or to Sena as the mood among them is anti-BJP. Besides, the Gujarati population, which is badly affected by the demonetisation, may vote for Sena candidates considering the personal relationship of some local candidates.” It seems like, the Modi wave hasn’t touched the BMC polls like the way it influenced the Odisha Panchayat Elections-2017. \n→ Not ruling out the North Indian votes, the Shiv Sena leader added that his party is hoping to get considerbale votes from North Indians. He said, “The Muslims too are not anti-Sena, but they will not vote for the BJP. So, we hope to get some Muslims votes as well. Overall, the Sena’s tally will reach 100 if we get some non-Maharashtrian votes.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:51:11.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
