Vine , the popular six-second online video service, has shut down. As expected, the Vine app has now been transformed into the Vine Camera app, which is already available to download from the Google Play Store.\nThe new app allows you to create six seconds long looping videos that you can either post directly to Twitter or save to your smartphone. To make the video making process easier and better, the app includes some of the standard Vine creation tools including multi-clip trimming, grid overlay, AF focus, and ghost tool.\nSee also: Twitter and Periscope launch support for 360 degree live video streaming 3 weeks ago If you want to try out the new Vine Camera app , simply update the existing Vine app you have on your device and you’re good to go.
