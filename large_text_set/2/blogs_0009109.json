The head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Rebecca Hilsenrath, has also said he is “hugely concerned” about a backlash against European citizens once the Government’s EU withdrawal negotiations begin. Hate crimes soared by 41% after Brexit vote, official figures reveal \nIn response, the Metropolitan Police , the UK’s largest force, said it was initiating a plan to increase intelligence gathering and reassure potential victims of racism and xenophobia. \nA spokeswoman said the force had witnessed a steady increase in hate crimes in recent years and acknowledged that “national and world events”, such as the activation of Article 50, could act as a “trigger”. \n“Where we identify a possible trigger event that could result in more hate crime, we instigate a community engagement plan to ensure those in communities who may be victims of hate crime know that we will not tolerate this kind of crime and that we encourage them to report this to the police,” she said. Polish ambassador calls on government to condemn Brexit-related hate crimes \nAssistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for hate crime, said the organisation had been in touch with European embassies based in the UK over the threat of increased violence. \n“We know that national and global events have the potential to trigger short-terms rises in hate crime and we saw this following the EU referendum last year,” he told The Independent . \n“We have increased the central reporting and monitoring functions to enable us to recognise spikes earlier. This will be used to assess any threats that may arise and inform local police activity.” \nPolice in Scotland said they had reactivated community impact assessments, which will allow the force to more easily investigate hate crimes as well as offering increased protection for at-risk groups. \nWest Midlands Police said they were “continually reviewing intelligence and community tension”. Members of the Polish community march through Harlow exactly a week after the killing of Arek Jóźwik ( Getty ) \n“Should we detect an emerging threat related to the triggering of Article 50 we would intervene swiftly to mitigate that through our officers, partners and communities,” Chief Superintendent Chris Johnson. “We have a zero tolerance stance on hate crime and recognise the impact it can have on communities.” \nA Government Bill giving Theresa May the power to trigger Article 50 cleared the House of Commons last week without any amendments being made, making it likely that the Prime Minister will be able to stick to her timetable of starting the process in early March. \nHome Office figures show that hate crimes soared by more than 40 per cent after last year’s Brexit vote. In July 2016, police recorded a 41 per cent increase compared to the same month a year earlier. \nData from 31 police forces showed that 1,546 racially or religiously aggravated offences were recorded in the two weeks up to and including the day of the referendum on 23 June. In the fortnight immediately after the poll, the number climbed to 2,241. \nIn one incident in Telford, Shropshire last year, a student was stabbed in the neck with a smashed drinks bottle “because he was speaking Polish”.

Andreas Dombret, who is an executive board member for the Bundesbank—Germany’s central bank—told a private meeting of German businesses and banks earlier this week in Frankfurt that even if banking rules were “equivalent” between the UK and the rest of the EU, that was still “miles away from [Britain having] access to the single market”, the BBC reports.

A vigil held in Harlow for Arek Jozwik , a Polish man killed in an attack believed to be a hate crime (PA) \n“For the most part these are not reported to the police or to company bosses as Poles prefer to keep their heads low and out of trouble.” \nDavid Isaac, head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, warned of the potential for increased violence. “After the rise in reported hate crime after the referendum, it makes sense to be prepared and plan for any potential spike in hate crimes throughout each point in the process,” he told The Independent . \n“The triggering of Article 50 is the next major milestone and we must do all we can to ensure people who may feel at risk are supported.” \nSuch is the scale of the problem that the Government has awarded researchers at Cardiff University a £250,000 grant to help monitor Brexit-related hate crime on social media. Graphiq \nProfessor Matthew Williams, lead investigator and co-director of the Social Data Science Lab at the university, said: \"Hate crimes have been shown to cluster in time and tend to increase, sometimes significantly, in the aftermath of 'trigger' events. \n\"The referendum on the UK's future in the European Union has galvanised certain prejudiced opinions held by a minority of people, resulting in a spate of hate crimes. \n\"Many of these crimes are taking place on social media. Over the coming period of uncertainty relating to the form of the UK's exit, decision makers, particularly those responsible for minimising the risk of social disorder through community reassurance, local policing and online governance, will require near-real-time information on the likelihood of escalation of hateful content spread on social media.” Police officers monitor the crowds at the Notting Hill Carnival on 29 August 2011 in London ( Getty ) \nOther forces said they were awaiting instructions from the Home Office on how to address any potential spike in hate crimes once Article 50 is invoked. \nBut the Government declined to tell The Independent what extra guidance it was giving police forces. \nA spokesperson said the deployment of resources was an “operational matter” for local forces, adding: “The Home Secretary has been crystal clear that crime motivated by hostility and prejudice towards any group in society has no place whatsoever in a Britain that works for everyone. \n“That is why we have some of the strongest legislation on hate crime in the world.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:03:41.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
