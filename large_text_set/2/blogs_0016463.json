She published 12 novels and a collection of short stories—plus additional prolific content that is being explored and uncovered at the Huntington Library in her hometown of Pasadena. Two of those books are her Parables— Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents . \nAs soon as it became clear that Candidate Rump was seriously running for president, I returned to the Parables . \nIn Parable of the Sower , we meet Lauren Olamina, a 15-year-old black girl who lives in a gated community with her preacher father, stepmother, brothers, friends, and lover. She lives in a society in which a radical right white male leader Andrew Jarrett has been elected President after promising to “make America great again.” Yup. \nThe society is technically a democracy, but the economic and racial dynamics mean that there are people assuming false normalcy behind walls of isolation—there are people living in apocalyptic conditions outside those walls. Corporations offer people homes in “company towns”—you must work to stay, a constant state of indebtedness to the company. \nRELATED: 10 Books Like 1984 \nLauren is a visionary and a hyperempath—she feels whatever she sees. To go outside the sheltering walls and see extreme poverty, violence, fights, and death is debilitating for her—she feels as if each thing she sees is actually happening to her. We learn how this condition impacts her journeys through the world and her relationships with family and loved ones. \nHer vision pulls her forward: She feels that humans are “Earthseed,” and that the “destiny of Earthseed is to take root amongst the stars”—that Earth is a womb for human development, and the stars are our future. And in order to move towards that future, we need to know how to be with each other, with the land, and with change. Change is the constant divine force of Lauren’s belief system, which she documents in The Books of Earthseed . \n“All that you touch", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:07:20.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
