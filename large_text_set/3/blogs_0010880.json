Some spin-off shows have been hugely successful - but there have also been quite a few flops. \nHere's a round-up of some of the best and worst: \nCheers and Frasier Image copyright Getty Images \nFrasier is one of television's most successful spin-offs. \nIt lasted for 11 seasons and notched up 264 episodes - just behind its predecessor Cheers, which managed 270. \nThe Kelsey Grammar sitcom continued the story of radio psychiatrist Frasier Crane. Digital Spy's TV editor Morgan Jeffrey thinks the change in tone contributed to its success. \n\"Frasier had a different style and sense of humour to Cheers,\" he says. \"A spin-off needs to look and feel different. A lot of bad spin-offs are just watered down versions of the original.\" \nThe change certainly worked wonders for Frasier - the sitcom broke the Emmy Awards record, winning 37 over the course of its run (although the record was later beaten by the pesky Game of Thrones). \nBreaking Bad and Better Call Saul Image copyright Getty Images \nWhile Breaking Bad centred on characters played by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, corrupt lawyer Saul Goodman (played by Bob Odenkirk) developed something of a cult following. \nBetter Call Saul, which began in 2015, was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, the brains behind Breaking Bad. \nThe Times's TV critic Andrew Billen thinks focusing on a less prominent character can often make a spin-off more likely to succeed. \n\"Most shows are not Marvel Comic universes, they're built around one or two heroes,\" he says. \"But if you take a minor character, there's more chance of succeeding. Then you're into something much nearer to a Hollywood franchise.\" \nJeffrey agrees: \"Angel is a good example of a character who maybe wasn't getting the screen time when he was on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, so he was given a show where there was more space to explore that character.\" \nHappy Days and its seven spin-offs Image copyright REX/Shutterstock \nHappy Days certainly knows a thing or two about spin-offs - it had seven. Seven! \nThe most successful were Mork & Mindy, which starred Robin Williams; and Laverne & Shirley, which was fronted by Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams. \nThe latter focused on two single roommates (who had been friends of Fonzie's in the main show) who work as bottlecappers in a Milwaukee brewery. \nIt ran side-by-side with Happy Days, and by its third season had become the most popular TV show in the US. \nSadly its reign was short lived and the show was cancelled in 1983 - but it still managed an impressive eight seasons. \nFriends and Joey Image copyright PA \nAs one of the most successful sitcoms in television history, Friends was ripe for spin-off when it ended in 2004. \nOnly Matt LeBlanc stuck with the character that made him famous, and Joey was launched that September. \nBut it didn't go down well with fans, and viewing figures were low. It was cancelled after two seasons, with the final eight episodes not even making it to air. \n\"Matt LeBlanc was fantastic in [Friends] but he was playing a caricature,\" Billen says. \"I'm not sure there was enough complexity to Joey as a character, he was more of a clown, and it's difficult to build a show around that premise.\" \nJeffrey adds: \"I don't feel there was a clear creative vision behind Joey, they just wanted to keep the Friends train going for a few more years.\" \nThe Mary Tyler Moore Show and its three spin-offs Image copyright REX/Shutterstock \nWhen it comes to spin-offs, Billen describes The Mary Tyler Moore Show as \"the mother of them all\". \nHe explains: \"It was so successful, the best friend Rhoda, played by Valerie Harper, got a spin-off. And the neighbour and landlady Phyllis also span off, but the really significant one was Lou Grant. \n\"In the original show, Mary Tyler Moore's character worked in a TV station in the newsroom, and the news editor [Grant] then span off into a drama series. It ran many seasons, and was a post-Watergate view of investigative journalism.\" \nIncluding the original, that totals an impressive four shows in the Tyler Moore universe. \nOnly Fools and Horses and Green Green Grass \nAsk a British sitcom fan what their favourite shows of all time are, and it's likely Only Fools and Horses will figure highly on their list. \nIt's slightly less likely they'd choose The Green Green Grass, the Fools spin-off that began in 2005 and focused on Boycie and his wife Marlene \nIt managed 32 episodes but was cancelled in 2009 after continuing negative reviews from critics. \nThe world of CSI Image copyright Getty Images \nCSI: Crime Scene Investigation began in September 2002 and was hugely popular with audiences. \nSo popular, in fact, that it sparked CSI: Miami, CSI: NY and the more recent (and less successful) CSI: Cyber. \nJeffrey says the CSIs \"work on a business level because you're giving people more of what they enjoyed before\". \nCSI: Skegness surely only a matter of time. \nThe Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Iain Armitage will play a younger version of Jim Parsons's character Sheldon Cooper \nJeffrey thinks it could be just the right time for The Big Bang Theory to get the spin-off treatment. \n\"I believe it's close to being renewed again but it doesn't feel like it's got too much life left in it,\" he says. \"It's probably got a couple more seasons before the cast try and shoehorn themselves out of the show.\" \nThe Guardian 's Stuart Heritage put it slightly more bluntly, writing that the announcement of Young Sheldon means \"The Big Bang Theory has officially started its death spiral\". \nBig Bang may well be ripe for a spin-off, but its makers will have to tread carefully. \n\"There's absolutely no guarantee a spin-off will work better than any brand new comedy or a brand new programme,\" cautions Billen. \n\"It will give you ratings for the first couple of episodes, and after that it sinks or swims on its own merit.\" \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
