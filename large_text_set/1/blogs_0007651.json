Other Records Robin holds the record for the youngest person to receive a bounty in the series, at the age of eight. Chopper is the second youngest at the age of fifteen. Luffy's 30,000,000 bounty broke the record for active East Blue bounties, as well as the highest new bounty for an East Blue pirate. Luffy holds the highest value of known bounty increases (being more than 16.67 times larger than the starting value, from 30,000,000 to 500,000,000). Luffy also holds the record for the highest amount of times of getting a new bounty, having received five bounties. The oldest known bounties are jointly held by Dorry and Brogy — over a hundred years each. The current known Shichibukai former bounties total up to over 871,000,000. Including the former members, it would be 2,512,000,000. The Eleven Supernovas' original bounties total up to 2,152,000,000, the highest of any known group. As the Worst Generation, their current known total bounty is 3,430,000,000, the highest known of any group to date. The highest (non-pirate) organization was Baroque Works , whose bounties when the group was active totaled 160,000,000. The group only had bounties for Robin and Crocodile, all other agents received their bounties after the fall of Baroque Works. It was stated that Crocodile would have had a far higher bounty if the World Government had been aware of his affiliation with Baroque Works prior to his defeat and arrest. Charlotte Smoothie currently has the largest known active bounty of all revealed female characters with 932,000,000. Robin currently has the most bounty picture changes in the series with a total of three. Sanji is the only known bounty holder wanted \"Only Alive\". Usopp holds the highest rate of bounty increase with multiplier rate of 6.66 times or 666% in percentage (30 million to 200 million) followed by Nami with the bounty rate increase of 4.125 times or 412.5% in percentage (16 to 66 million). \nNote: The records are only for confirmed bounties Anime and Manga Differences \nThe bounty poster has a small caption in the bottom left corner. While in the manga it's not comprehensible what it does say, in the anime there is written \"KONO SAKUHIN HA FICTION DETHUNODE JITSUZAISURU JINBUTSU DANTAISONOTA NO SOSHIKI TO DOITSU NO MEISHOU GA GEKICHU NI TOUJYOU SHITATOSHITEMO JITSUZAI NA MONOTOHA ISSAI MUKANKEIDETH\", which can roughly be translated as \"Because this performance is fiction, existing characters, associations and other organizations with similar names which appeared during the play are without exception unrelated\" , a version of the \" All persons are fictitious \" disclaimer. Trivia Although there were sometimes bounties placed on real world pirates, the largest known bounty ever placed was £1000 on Henry Avery . It should be noted that despite inflation this is still only equivalent to roughly £120,000, $160,000, or ¥1.7 million. Oda confirmed that if Enel were actually a wanted criminal, he would have a bounty that could reach up to Known bounties of unseen or unnamed characters: A criminal with a 42,000,000 Bounty was said to have been taken down by Mr. 3 . A pirate with a 50,000,000 Bounty was defeated by Smoker . A pirate captain with a 55,000,000 Bounty unsuccessfully tried to join the Impostor Straw Hat Pirates . It is possible for pets to earn bounties, which are far lower than standard. Both Tony Tony Chopper and Bepo , mistaken for pets, were given such treatment. Ironically, while Bepo's bounty is a mere 500 because of his appearance, fellow Mink Pekoms managed to earn a much higher 330,000,000. In the 4Kids dub, the \"Dead or Alive\" and sometimes the \"Wanted\" have been erased from the wanted posters. [ citation needed ] In the first databook , Kuro's bounty is stated to be 16,000,000. [94] Whenever it is in the movie intros it is incorrectly shown as 14,000,000. [95] Interestingly, Vander Decken IX has a different wanted poster than everyone else. Instead of saying \"WANTED\" at the top, it says \"DANGER\". This may be because it does not seem to be a World Government-issued wanted poster. [96] Law's wanted poster shows Bepo appearing in the background with his head turned in the same position and stance as Usopp in Luffy’s first wanted poster photo. [97] Brook is the only known criminal who was issued a completely uniquely-designed wanted poster by the World Government, as they used one of his old concert posters rather than the standard brown-colored design. Usopp and Brook are the only ones who have both their names and Epithet appear on their poster. Bentham (Mr. 2 Bon Kurei} and Kyros (Thunder Soldier) have their aliases instead of their names. The Red Arrows Pirates are the only crew to have a bounty, rather than an individual person.
