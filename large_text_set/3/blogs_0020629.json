The overall effect is incredibly chic, but also blissfully achievable for regular folks like us who want to take a page from Bell’s style book.\nCindy Ord/Getty Images Can you say freshhh! We’re obsessed.\nBell’s jumpsuit game has been on point lately. The actress donned a metallic, mermaid-style one piece to the People’s Choice Awards in January that had us rethinking our formalwear wardrobes. And now with this look in our back pockets, it’s safe to say jumpsuits are fast becoming our everyday outfits of choice.\nOne of my fav outfits ever promoting #CHIPSmovie in NY this week- thank u @alc_ltd!

They’ve been making the media rounds this week and in an interview with People on Monday , the couple opened up about how they keep their famously joyful relationship in tact.\n“We have a very healthy marriage and we got there by doing therapy when we needed it, and constantly doing fierce moral inventories,” said Bell.\n“We both take responsibility when we are wrong, and I think it is easy to work with him because I married him, because I enjoy spending time with him and I trust him. That is exactly what I want in someone that I work with.” Sounds like exactly the kind of marriage we should all aspire to!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:46:02.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
