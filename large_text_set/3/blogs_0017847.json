Danny Welbeck caused problems with his pace and movement, Harry Kane pulled off a Cruyff turn before his goal and Jamie Vardy scored with a brilliant flick four minutes after coming off the bench. Roy Hodgson had an embarrassment of riches up front. Wayne Rooney was still to return from injury, Daniel Sturridge was fit at last and Marcus Rashford was shooting to prominence at Manchester United. \nReality soon gave that optimism a good shoeing, of course, and England lost to Iceland in the last 16 in France. Hodgson’s forwards managed a combined total of three goals in four games. Kane took a lot of bad corners but he was still the future. He has scored 24 goals for Tottenham this season. \nYet as England prepare for Wednesday’s friendly against Germany in Dortmund and Sunday’s World Cup qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley, their attacking options look a little sparse. Kane’s ankle injury has exposed a weakness in Gareth Southgate’s squad. With Rooney’s days at the top numbered, Sturridge injured and Welbeck recently back from serious injury, Southgate has picked only three forwards. One of them is the 34-year-old Jermain Defoe , who plays for the worst team in the Premier League. Who else is out there? Watford’s uncapped Troy Deeney, perhaps, or West Ham’s injury-prone Andy Carroll. Neither is a convincing answer. \nYet the situation is not as bleak as it might appear at first glance. Southgate still has quality in attack and the potential for plenty of goals from midfield. STRIKERS \nJermain Defoe The former Tottenham striker has not featured for England since November 2013 and his career at the highest level appeared to be over when he joined Toronto FC in 2014. Yet he did not enjoy his time in MLS and he jumped at the chance to return to the Premier League when Sunderland, desperate for a potent striker to save them from relegation, offered him a three-and-a-half-year contract worth £70,000 a week. \nEyebrows were raised at the wisdom of giving a deal that lucrative to a player in his 30s but Defoe has more than paid Sunderland back with 33 goals in 79 league matches. The last of his 13 goals for England came against San Marino four years ago, his limited all-round play has held him back in the past and he is definitely not one for the future, but Defoe’s finishing remains as lethal as ever and he deserves his recall. \nMarcus Rashford The 19-year-old has not quite been able to push on after bursting on to the scene so thrillingly last season and he probably would have been in the under-21s before Kane injured his ankle against Millwall last weekend. Although there was a desire for Rashford to reacclimatise at the younger age level before a summer in which the Football Association wants him to play in the European Under-21 Championship in Poland, he has also performed patchily for Manchester United this season and has not scored in the Premier League since September. \nHis finishing has lacked conviction at times. However that barren run needs to be put in context. It was always likely that Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s arrival at Old Trafford would stall Rashford’s momentum. José Mourinho sees Ibrahimovic as a mandatory pick up front and Rashford has often had to be content with starting on the right or left of United’s attack, even though he impressed as the focal point of Louis van Gaal’s spearhead after breaking into the first team last year. His talent is not in doubt, though, and his blend of speed, imagination and skill makes Rashford one of the most exciting prospects in England. \nJamie Vardy The Leicester striker has returned to his snarling, sniping best since Claudio Ranieri’s sacking last month and has the strongest claim to lead the line against Germany. Vardy scored 24 goals as Leicester swept to the title last season, grabbed England’s equaliser in their win over Wales in France last summer and converted a penalty in the 2-2 draw with Spain in November. \nHe has found it tougher going this season but that crucial away goal against Sevilla had a transformative effect on his and Leicester’s fortunes. Craig Shakespeare replaced Ranieri the next day and Vardy has not looked back. He scored twice in the win over Liverpool, terrorised Hull’s Andrea Ranocchia two weeks ago and was a thorn in Sevilla’s side when Leicester beat the Spanish side to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. Samir Nasri is not a fan but Vardy has his mojo back. MIDFIELDERS \nWhile England have a lack of suitable No9s at the moment, their attacking midfielders will allow Southgate to use a 4-2-3-1 formation. Dele Alli, Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling are the likeliest support cast for Vardy. Alli has almost played like a second striker for Tottenham this season, dovetailing expertly with Kane and scoring 17 for club and country, Lallana has impressed for Liverpool and scored in each of his past three matches for England, and Sterling is one away from reaching on double figures in all competitions for Manchester City. All three need to perform more consistently in an England shirt, but offer hope for the future. \nThere is not much experience in Southgate’s squad but he is giving chances to young and unfamiliar faces. While Michail Antonio might have to withdraw from the squad after tweaking a hamstring in West Ham United’s defeat to Leicester City on Saturday, Southampton’s Nathan Redmond has earned his first call-up after improving his final product. Redmond is only 23, the same as Everton’s increasingly confident Ross Barkley, while Jesse Lingard, 24, has a knack of scoring important goals. All is not lost.
