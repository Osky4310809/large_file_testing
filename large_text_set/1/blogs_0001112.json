The first teaser for the series featured only Warburton, telling fans about the perils that the characters in the show will face. \nIn the new teaser, Snicket appears over the footage and gives viewers this message: \n\"The cinematic tease before you is full of disturbed plots, villainous frightful deeds, and an absurd amount of child endangerment. Do you really want to sit through every horrid episode? Be a dear, and look away.\" \nThis may seem like an actual warning not to watch the show, but the message captures the dark-yet-lively tone of the Unfortunate Events books , and highlights the deadpan humor of Patrick Warburton. \nWarning aside, many fans will probably flood Netflix on January 13 to get their first taste of the network's latest hit. \nMORE: Closer Look At Neil Patrick Harris As Count Olaf / New Character Posters For A Series Of Unfortunate Events Revealed / A Series Of Unfortunate Events Trailer Released (Photo: Netflix) \nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans -- Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance.
