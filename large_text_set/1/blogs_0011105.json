Even in their native range, these orange thugs are aggressive to the point of being a nuisance. Note that there is a difference between the terms \" invasive \" and \"aggressive.\" Technically, to be classified as invasive in a region, a plant must be foreign (or \"alien\") to that region. On its home turf, such a plant would be termed \"aggressive,\"\"thuggish,\" etc. (choose your synonym). Of course, to the gardener faced with prospect of having to control trumpet vines, the point is merely academic: regardless of what you call them, you have your work cut out for you. \nThese plants spread by suckering underground runners, as well as from seed. The flip side of all this aggressiveness: they are useful in soil erosion prevention . \nConcerns over the plants' aggressiveness extends to use around your home, garage or outdoor storage shed : The holdfasts of their aerial roots can damage siding on buildings. \nCampsis radicans is also a skin irritant for some people. Care (Pruning), Wildlife Attracted by Trumpet Vines \nMost care issues revolve around containing trumpet vines: They are not for low-maintenance landscaping . Grow them on a sturdy garden arbor or wooden fence . This vigorous grower does need to be contained if you don't want it spreading all over the place! Faithfully pull up any new shoots that pop up from the root system, and remove the seeds before they fall upon the earth. \nCampsis radicans blooms on new growth (new wood), so many people prune it in early spring. \nBirdwatchers are often tempted to plant trumpet vines because they draw hummingbirds. But other plants that attract hummingbirds are available, including some lower-maintenance plants. My Own Experience \nI have a lot of personal experience with trumpet vines -- specifically, bad experience. My now deceased dad, a hummingbird aficionado, saw trumpet vines advertised in a nursery catalog, touting them as the ultimate \"hummingbird plants.\" He decided to plant some. But this aggressive plant , once established, began spreading out of control; and now, decades later, I continue the on-going battle of trying to rein it in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:35:05.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
