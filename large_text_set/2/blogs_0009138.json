You dig what I’m saying? Gucci know how I feel about him. It was a lot of rappers in the studio when me and Gucci was going at it. And I made that baby sit down … If you wanna play tough and act like you macho and you the big dog and you this, that, and the third, cool. But the streets gonna wipe your nose every time.” \nFlocka also asked: “Since Gucci been out, did he shoot a video in East Atlanta? Alright. I’m exposing these folks. I ain’t no hater, I’m just exposing.” \nCheck out the full lyrics below via Genius and draw your own conclusions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:38:25.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
