Which means on Sunday we will once again see the riches of Hollywood walk down a red velvet carpet and show off their expensive attire. \nThere will be awards, presentations, acceptance speeches and a new category you've never heard of. \nWhich is why we think it's important to give the five chaps in the video above a special mention. \nThis year, these five special footballers individually produced some of the finest acting performances on a football pitch you're likely to bear witness to. \nLet's take a look. Arsen Khubulov \nThe Kuban Krasnodar striker literally throws himself to the ground in laughable fashion after realising he can't beat two defenders. Arturo Vidal \nThe Chilean jumps in the air like a school kid in a bid to trick the referee. It's actually makes quite embarrassing viewing. Cristiano Ronaldo (Photo: Getty) \nThe former king of playacting returns in a one-off cameo role. After receiving a little shove from teammate Luka Modric, Ronaldo proceeds to fall to the ground in slow motion. Marcelo Leite Pereira \nThis fella in the Indian Premier League goes full Michael Jordan from Space Jam. After slightly bouncing off a defender, Pereira completely overreacts and launches himself into the air. Rossi of Goias (L) and Marcelo Cordeiro \nThis double act are the funniest duo since Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in Step Brothers. The pair perfectly synchronise their dives together to stoop to a whole new low. poll loading Which playactor deserves to win an Oscar? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T17:16:03.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
