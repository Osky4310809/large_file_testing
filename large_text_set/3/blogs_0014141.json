Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nRonald Koeman has told contract rebel Romelu Lukaku that Everton will decide when he leaves Goodison. \nThe Premier League's top goalscorer rocked Blues chiefs when he told them he WON'T sign a new deal, just minutes after top brass had expressed their confidence he would put pen to paper imminently. \nLukaku , who has been linked with Manchester United , suggested he has refused to extend his current deal because of a lack of ambition from the Blues, and their inability to sign top quality players this season. \nKoeman has hit back by suggesting he will speak to his board about the possibility of disciplinary action against the striker after his outburst, and he also warned the much-admired forward that his refusal to sign sign a new deal, doesn't automatically mean he can leave in the summer. Lukaku and Barkley's futures remain uncertain (Photo: Everton FC) \n\"First of all the deal wasn't agreed and 99.9 per cent is not 100 per cent - they are still trying to get the contract over the line and that is what I know from the board of the club,\" Koeman explained. \n\"Everybody knows anything can happen in football but you have to respect your contract. \n\"There is no problem, his behaviour except some quotes in this interview I like from the player and there is no need to put him out of the team. Rom scores goals and we like to keep the momentum, like to keep going.\" \nAsked how long talks could go on with Lukaku, the Dutch boss added: \"There is no definite decision - because his contract is still two more years at Everton.

We know he's one of the best and the rest needs to be done by the manager and the board of the club.\" \nKoeman also warned Ross Barkley that he must decide at the end of the season whether he wants to remain at Goodison....or be sold: Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T17:38:25.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
