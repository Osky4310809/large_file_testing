For most of our waking time, we are online, at least most of us. There is hardly anything that we can’t do using our cellphones, save may be shave our beards (who knows mobiles might have inbuilt shavers in future). In this age of demonetization and internet on our fingertips, when we do everything from buying more tickets online to posting our selfies on FB, can we use our thumbs for some really noble cause! What about contributing to the families of our martyrs? Every year we lose hundreds of valiant jawans from all forces, Army, BSF, CRPF, and Police. Precious lives are lost on the hostile borders with our neighbors and in inhospitable terrains of our naxal infested areas. And almost all the jawans die as unsung heroes. Why? Is it because life is cheap in our country? Particularly of those who come from humble backgrounds? \nAlmost all our soldiers come from simple rural areas or small towns. They are invariably the sole bread winners for their families, pillars of support and the pride of their locality. Many of them just have a dream to don a uniform, they grow up with the sole aim of fulfilling the promises they made to their elders and families. But only a small number of fortunate guys get selected after some really grueling exams that test their physical prowess and mental tenacity. I have seen young men running and collapsing during grueling races in scorching heat, and then get up again knowing that they might never get another chance. \nFor some people, it might be another job but there’s something surreal, magical when you put on a uniform. You transform into a sentinel of the nation. A strong sense of patriotism, dedication and zeal takes over you. Even the simplest soul turns into a mean fighting machine, of course, with a lot of training and disciplining. \nA soldier knows that his life is always on stake, it’s a professional hazard. Every now and then we lose our jawans in various battles, at the enemy front fighting infiltrators and terrorists, our policemen in encounters with criminals or during law and order problems, while facing a mob. Or in rescue missions during calamities and even during training accidents. Even otherwise an average constable of any force remains away from his family for most part of his service. He hardly has the pleasure of watching his children grow up. Most of the time he will be working in very harsh terrains, working in isolation from the common people, having little or no communication with the outside world. He doesn’t have the luxury of a 9 to 5 job, he is always on duty. Yes, a soldier’s life is tough. \nMore often than not, the deaths of jawans don’t make much news, except may be when we lose men on the border. It’s probably that our sense of nationalism is aroused only during the ceremony at Wagah Border or a cricket match with our not so friendly neighbor. But what about the men who die while serving inside the country, fighting the enemy within? One such case is the recent killing of CRPF jawans in Sukma. Was their sacrifice any less than of those who fight on the border? \nBut things are changing for the better. It is indeed heartening to know that more and more people are saluting the spirit of our men in uniform. Actor Akshay Kumar has always been on the forefront and his recent contribution to the families of the slain jawans further vindicated our respect for our men. Even Saina Nehwal, our badminton champ has shown her heart by helping the martyr’s families. Money can never substitute a life, it can’t bring back husband or a father. But still it will give hope to the bereaved family to have a better future, an opportunity to fulfill some dreams. And more than that, our small iota of contribution will make the martyr’s family feel that the nation is with them in their hour of grief. Our support will show that the life of the soldier mattered to us. \nAll of us feel that we can help a jawan’s cause but don’t know how to go about it. Most of us are worried if our money, our contribution will actually reach the rightful beneficiary? For this, Akshay came up with a simple yet revolutionary idea of making an app for supporting our heroes in uniform. Imagine, you are waiting at the railway station and come to know about the martyrdom of our jawans, you immediately go to the app, find out the properly verified details and bank account of the immediate kin of the slain man and contribute in your own way, big or small. \nThough the government does every bit to support the martyr’s family, instant help by this app will be a great relief for any crestfallen family. All your contributions can greatly enhance a simple household’s assets. This idea has been seriously considered by the Hon’ble Prime minister and the Hon’ble Home minister. It will be a great boon for our men and of course, a small but great way for showing our respect to our real heroes. So start twiddling your thumbs on your phone screen and make someone have a ‘Twinkle’ in his eyes. And yes, be good citizens of our country and be worthy of the sacrifice of our jawans.
