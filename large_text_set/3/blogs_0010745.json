Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nNicola Sturgeon has vowed to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence in protest at Theresa May’s “hard Brexit .” \nThe First Minister said the vote would take place between Autumn 2018 and Spring 2019. \nShe said she had tried to reach a compromise agreement with the UK Government but her efforts had been rebuffed by the Prime Minister. \n“As we stand on the eve of Article 50 being triggered, the UK goverment has not moved even an inch in pursuit of compromise or agreement. \n“All of our efforts at compromise have been met with a brick wall of intransigence. (Photo: Sky News) \n“UK membership of the single market was ruled out with no prior consultation with the Scottish Government or with the other devolved administrations, leaving us facing not just Brexit , but a hard Brexit. \n“And far from any prospect of significant new powers for the Scottish Parliament, the UK Government is becoming ever more assertive in its intention to muscle in on the powers we already have. The language of partnership has gone, completely,” she said. \nMs Sturgeon said the Scottish now faced a choice between a hard Brexit or a vote on independence. \n\"The people of Scotland must be offered a choice between a hard Brexit and becoming an independent country,\" she said. \nMs Sturgeon said she would seek a Section 30 order next week from the Scottish Parliament authorising the independence referendum. \n“It will give the Scottish people a choice about the kind of change we want. \n“Scotland’s future will be decided by the people of Scotland. It will be Scotland’s choice. I trust the Scottish people to make that choice,” she said. (Photo: Sky News) \nShe added: “I will continue to stand up for Scotland's interests during the process of Brexit negotiations. \n\"But I will take the steps necessary now to make sure that Scotland will have a choice at the end of this process – a choice of whether to follow the UK to a hard Brexit , or to become an independent country able to secure a real partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and our own relationship with Europe.” \nThe First Minister said the mandate for holding a second poll was \"beyond doubt.\" \n\"If I ruled out a referendum, I would be deciding – completely unilaterally – that Scotland will follow the UK to a hard Brexit come-what-may, no matter how damaging to our economy and our society it turns out to be,\" she said. \nScotland voted by 55% to 45% three years ago to stay in the United Kingdom.

We do not want to be divided again, but that is exactly what another independence referendum would do. \n\"Two years ago, 85 per cent of Scotland’s voters took part in the independence referendum and the result was a clear vote to remain in the UK. \n\"With our country facing all of the uncertainty around the Tories’ reckless plans for a hard Brexit , the last thing we need is even more uncertainty and division.\" \nScottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: \"Nicola Sturgeon has today chosen the path of further division and uncertainty. \n\"We will vote against any request for a Section 30 next week.\" \nScottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale tweeted: \"Scotland is already divided enough. We do not want to be divided again, but that is exactly what another independence referendum would do.\" Scottish Conservative party leader Ruth Davidson said a second referendum would be divisive (Photo: PA) \nA UK government spokesman said: “As the Prime Minister has set out, the UK Government seeks a future partnership with the EU that works for the whole of the United Kingdom. \n\"The UK Government will negotiate that agreement, but we will do so taking into account the interests of all of the nations of the UK. \n\"We have been working closely with all the devolved administrations - listening to their proposals, and recognising the many areas of common ground, including workers’ rights, the status of EU citizens living in the UK and our security from crime and terrorism. \n“Only a little over two years ago people in Scotland voted decisively to remain part of our United Kingdom in a referendum which the Scottish Government defined as a ‘once in a generation’ vote. The evidence clearly shows that a majority of people in Scotland do not want a second independence referendum. \n\"Another referendum would be divisive and cause huge economic uncertainty at the worst possible time. “The Scottish Government should focus on delivering good government and public services for the people in Scotland.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T14:50:12.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
