Photo by Josh Albelda/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) - The De La Salle University Lady Spikers posted back-to-back wins to start the second round of eliminations after routing National University, 25-21, 25-11, 15-25, 25-12 on Sunday, March 12 at the Smart-Araneta Coliseum. The defending champs capitalized on the Lady Bulldogs' unforced errors, which totaled at 20 in the first two sets, to gain a 2-0 lead in the game. The Lady Spikers, however, had their share of 14 errors in the third set as NU pulled away with a 25-15 output. La Salle meanwhile shook off the third set defeat in a commanding manner as they hopped on an 18-6 lead in the 4th to cap off the match. \"[At the start of the] 4th set, nasa likod si Jaja [Santiago],\" said DLSU head coach Ramil de Jesus after the game. \"Nakita ko 'yung advantage noon.\" (At the start of the 4th set, Jaja was at the back row. I saw it as an advantage for the team.) Kim Dy put up a game-high 17 markers from 12 spikes, 2 blocks, and 3 aces, while Majoy Baron had 15 from 8 spikes and 6 blocks. The Lady Spikers likewise capitalized on their foes' reception errors, listing 12 service aces in the match. Jorelle Singh had a team-high 12 points from 9 spikes, 1 block, and 2 aces, while Jaja Santiago and Aiko Urdas had 9 and 7 respectively. With the victory, the Lady Spikers move to a 7-2 slate, while National U settle for 5-4. DLSU will next face the University of the Philippines Lady Maroons on Sunday, March 19.
