Is she too much of an ethical Goody Two-Shoes? After all, what other starlet assigns fashion designers homework before she wears their clothes? Steinem is not amused. \"Let me ask you something: If you did a story on a young male actor who was very private and involved in activism, would you think he was too severe or serious? Why do women always have to be listeners? Emma is interested in the world, she is caring, and though she is active she is also joyous and informed.\" At this point I’m backpedaling—\"I think she’s wonderful!\"—but Steinem still digs in. “It’s possible to be both serious and fun, you know. That response is why men will ask a woman, 'Why don’t you just smile, honey?'\"\nGood try though, Blasberg.\nBONUS: Here's how the live-action 'Beauty and the Beast' characters compare to the original", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/9NvfwHkg.jpg", "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/dont-try-to-gossip-about-emma-watson-with-gloria-steinem.html", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/9NvfwHkg.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-01T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:13:54.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
