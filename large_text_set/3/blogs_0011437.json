You've just got your vision and you try to fulfill that. \n\"It's really hard to say how I do it. It's like if someone asks, 'How do you sexually satisfy your girlfriend?' You don't follow any rules of any book. Maybe some do, or some watch porn and try to recreate it, but most of them will fail regardless. \n\"What I do is just go for it and it's the same with the sex. I just go for it and try to be real and be me in that. And even if I fall, or I don't pull it off, or I'm not perfect, I'm not discouraged any more. \n\"I accept that this is me, this is how I work. The whole sense of life is just to be honest with yourself. It's a cliche, but that's what it is. That's how I feel about it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T06:39:50.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
