An Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview is available already, and in its fifth version since January 2017. Find out how you can get the Developer Preview up and running over at the Google Android Wear Developers page . \nWe gave Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview a test run with the futuristic Huawei Watch. Check out the video below to hear our thoughts and see the new version of the OS in action. \nMost notably, Android Wear 2.0 can run standalone apps, meaning the watch doesn't need to be in range of a smartphone for an app to work. This makes Android Wear more independent, striking out from the impression people have of smartwatches being expensive and unnecessary smartphone accessories. \nWith cellular support, Android Wear 2.0 lets you make calls, use OK Google, and more without relying on your phone being nearby. Not only that, the latest update to smartwatches brings support for Google Assistant, which we first saw with the release of its Pixel smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL , in addition to Android Pay. Complications, features showing data from apps, can now be shown on any watch face. / © Google \nMessaging saw an improvement through handwriting recognition, smart reply, and a swipe-enabled keyboard. Google placed many of its products at I/O under the umbrella of its machine learning expertise, and here things are no different. All three of these input methods are held up by Google's AI. And, although a keyboard may seem a poor choice of input on a screen so small, Google hopes that its machine learning algorithms are powerful enough to predict the words you want based on just the first letter or two that you enter. The three messaging input methods on Android Wear 2.0. / © Google \nWhen it comes to fitness, Google is providing interaction between fitness apps through the Google Fit API. This effectively allows apps to exchange information, such as calories burned and consumed, creating a more holistic experience. There's also activity recognition, so when you begin running, this can automatically be detected by a running app, which can begin timing your run, or counting your calories burned, for example. \nThere's also a Material Design overhaul of the Android Wear interface. This can be seen immediately in how notifications appear. Android Wear 2.0 sees a Material Design visual overhaul. / © Google When is my smartwatch getting the Android Wear 2.0 update? \nNewer smartwatches like the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style and the Huawei Watch 2 are shipping with Android Wear 2.0, but many older smartwatches will get the update as well. Android Wear 2.0's features will breathe new life into older smartwatches starting in February 2017 when the roll out begins. The OTA updates will happen gradually throughout the year. You can find out if and when your watch is being updated below: Asus Android Wear Update \nSome older smartwatches won't be getting the update to Android Wear 2.0, and unfortunately the very first Asus ZenWatch is one of them. The update for the Asus ZenWatch 2 and 3 is planned, but we don't yet know exactly when it will be rolled out.
