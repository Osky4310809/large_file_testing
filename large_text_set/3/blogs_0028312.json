We’re engaged in discussion with the union to get these employees back to work as soon as possible,\" AT&T said today.\nThe California and Nevada workers \"are some of the most highly paid union-represented employees in the company, and that will not change,\" AT&T also said. \"We are not proposing to reduce the wages of any employees in these contracts, and we remain committed to providing great benefits. As health care costs continue to increase, employees in this contract pay 40 percent less for medical care than the national average, and they pay less than AT&T managers.\" Further Reading Mayors slam AT&T for slow Internet, long phone outages\nThe employees have been working without a contract for nearly a year and are picketing AT&T call centers and offices in California and Nevada.\nMayors and other elected officials from California and Nevada have taken the workers' side in negotiations and have criticized AT&T for slow Internet service and long phone outages.\nThough the strike involves only landline workers, the CWA also criticized AT&T's treatment of DirecTV and mobile employees. About 2,200 DirecTV satellite and warehouse workers in the two states joined the CWA last year and are now negotiating with AT&T for their first contract, the union said.\n\"Nationwide, more than 21,000 AT&T wireless customer service and field workers are working under a contract extension that can be terminated with 72 hours’ notice as they continue to bargain with the company,\" the CWA also said. The wireless workers are calling for an \"end to offshoring and outsourcing.\"", "external_links": ["https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/att-truck-getty-360x200.jpg", "https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/basic-page/node-3024/basicguide.pdf"], "published": "2017-03-23T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:05:22.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
