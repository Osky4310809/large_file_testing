It was excellent.\nBut what will get you really choked up is Michelle surprising people who were recording thank you messages to her, unaware she was hiding backstage.\n\"Did you prepare that ahead of time? Oh my god, that was so beautiful,\" Michelle said, as a woman cried in her arms in excitement.\nA fitting farewell that's mostly celebration, not consternation. Thank YOU, Michelle!\nBONUS: Even Fox News is defending CNN against Trump", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/vZJGM3Fv.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/vZJGM3Fv.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-12T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T09:37:53.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
