It actually came before entering the White House when, last December, President-elect Trump announced he had persuaded the Carrier Corporation to keep in Indiana hundreds of jobs that had been slated to move to Mexico. A short time later, Politico ran a story headlined, \"Trump's Carrier deal is wildly popular.\" Imagine a headline like that about anything else the president has done. \nCompared to the big economic picture, the Carrier matter involved a tiny number of jobs. And there was quibbling about Carrier's intent. But Trump's involvement sent a clear message: I was elected to fix the economy, to bring more and better jobs to Americans, and that is going to be my first priority as president. \nNow, however, in the middle of his first 100 days in office, Trump has gotten bogged down in a complex, time-consuming, and unpopular fight over another issue — repealing and replacing Obamacare — that, while a key Republican priority and a Trump campaign promise, is not at the very top of the public's concerns. \nNew to Washington and with no experience in public office, Trump has become a prisoner to the House Republican leadership — or more precisely, to the complicated procedural requirements of the House and Senate, and the judgment of the GOP leadership that must operate within those boundaries. \nAll across the capital, politicos are arguing about what House Republicans should do next in the Obamacare fight. Can they prevail in the Budget Committee? How much damage has the CBO report done? Can the Freedom Caucus be brought aboard? What about the moderates? And reconciliation? The three-step process? \nIt has become mind-numbingly complicated. And perhaps the answer to all those questions is one simple sentence: Republicans are working on the wrong thing. And the Republican president is allowing himself to be distracted from delivering early and often on his core campaign promise of improving the economy and bringing jobs to millions of Americans. \nSpeaker Paul Ryan has made clear that Obamacare had to come first on the legislative calendar because of the requirements of reconciliation in the Senate, and because the Obamacare replacement's changes to the tax code have to be taken up before the larger budget and tax reform. And, of course, Hill Republicans have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare for years. So the House has dived in. \n\"They found themselves stuck in this legislative quagmire in terms of the sequence of what has to happen,\" notes a well-connected GOP strategist. \"Since they have to do this through reconciliation, they have to do it before the budget, and have to do it before tax reform.\" \nMeanwhile, Trump's jobs agenda will have to wait. Can anyone imagine candidate Donald Trump roaring to a raucous campaign rally that, 'We're going to bring your jobs back — big beautiful jobs\" but then going on to explain, \"Of course, we'll have to accommodate the House schedule…\" Also from the Washington Examiner", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T14:16:10.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
