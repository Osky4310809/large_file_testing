He was 82.\nThe cause of death was not released.\nGreen, a fiery personality who became known for his bluntness, was a baseball lifer who began his own big league career as a Phillies pitcher in 1960. He went 20-22 with a 4.26 ERA in his eight-year career, which included a 1966 stint with the Mets, before reaching the managerial ranks for which he would be remembered.\nGreen became the Philadelphia manager in 1979 and won the World Series the following season. After the Phillies’ record dipped in 1981, he was let go, only to pop up with the Yankees in 1989.\nAfter a brief, one-year stint, which saw him become another victim of George Steinbrenner’s quick hook, Green switched boroughs and managed the Mets from 1993-96. He went 229-283 before Bobby Valentine took over.\nGreen couldn’t stay away from baseball, though: He later became a senior adviser in the Phillies’ organization.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:25:55.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
