otherwise, they would have been dropped immediately. \n“It is a clear case of conflict of interest when the Federal Government engaged them to handle high-profile corruption cases and they were found to be defending similar high-profile suspects being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and other government agencies. \n“The danger is that there are a lot of strategic meetings the prosecutors have with the NPCC. \n“Some of the strategies require collaboration with other agencies. So, it is likely that some lawyers, who are part of the prosecutors’ team and also defending some of these high-profile suspects, will have access to privileged information which they can use to the benefit of the suspects they are defending. \n“From that, you can see where the issue of conflict of interest arises. \n“Through some preliminary random checks, at least, five of the SANs have been found to be handling such cases that put them in a position of such conflict of interest. \n“There are some of the SANs who are defending a former governor and other high-profile suspects.” \nAlthough, the source could not give an exact time when the culpable persons would be weeded out of the team, he said it was expected that more of such cases of conflict of interest could be discovered. \nThe source added, “I can’t say exactly when those lawyers will be dropped because the full investigation is just about to begin. \n“The investigation is expected to yield more discoveries. So, at the end of the day, we may have more than five lawyers who will be dropped from the team.” \nWhen contacted on Sunday, Isah, who is the spokesperson for both the AGF and the NPCC, said, “The process is ongoing, though we have not got to the stage of dropping any lawyer. \n“We are going to do background checks on all the lawyers as part of our investigation.” \nCopyright PUNCH.
