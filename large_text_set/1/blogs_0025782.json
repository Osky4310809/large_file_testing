Do it for social justice. #JumpAgainstTrump,” read a meme posted by Father Philip Pizzo just hours after he celebrated Sunday Mass.\nThe message included an illustration of a man plummeting from a skyscraper.\nThe conservative priest, who oversees St. Benedict Joseph Labre Roman Catholic Church in Richmond Hill, previously posted a photo of Obama with the words “He’s not my president’’ and another snapshot of Hillary Clinton titled “Ugly Face’’ in Italian along with “Happy Halloween.’’\nPizzo, 67, told The Post on Monday that he just thought the “Jump Against Trump’’ meme was “funny.”\n“I do not promote suicide,’’ Pizzo insisted. “I’ve helped many people over the years, and it does not promote suicide. It was funny.”\nBut some parishioners were outraged.\n“Suicide is not funny, plain and simple,” said Carlos Coburn, a congregant who once sought counseling from Pizzo because he was struggling with thoughts about killing himself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T07:03:17.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
