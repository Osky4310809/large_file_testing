In this interview ahead of his 50th birthday today, he speaks on his plans for the state and his motivation for the contest. Excerpts: \nH IS plans : My folks are widely recognized for their industry, courage and resourcefulness. These qualities have enabled us survive as a people in the face of daunting existential challenges. It’s worth recalling that at creation in August 27, 1991, by the General Ibrahim Babangida regime Ndi-Anambra had over 75 percent literacy level and boasted extra-ordinary human and material resources. These attributes need to be given a new direction, new discipline and new energy. God has given me the vision to do this,” he said. \nI have identified 10 key sectors that deserve total focus to transform the state. These include security, infrastructural development which is foundation for industrialisation and will support Nnewi, Onitsha and Awka as critical technology hubs, real agricultural revolution. \nDeploying a transparent, judicious and efficient management of resources, I will empower our people with skills acquisition, mainstream our judiciary, step-up sports, provide microfinance for SMEs and pursue an integrated development scheme that should fundamentally change the game in Anambra State.” •Uzor: Wants to be Anambra gov \nHis motivation: I did not signal my intention to contest the 2017 governorship election in my state lightly. It was a product of deep introspection. I believe that at this moment of our national history and the rapid changes impacting both the continental and international arena, Anambra needs a deep but temperate personality and thinker to guide its journey. \nFundamental connections \nLet me share this with you and many may not know this. The fate of Anambra State has fundamental connections with the fate of Ndigbo and Nigeria at large.” \nHis view about governance: In the arena of politics the world over, governance, actually good governance is central to human development and social progression. The converse leads to retrogression and socio-political stagnation. Look around you to discern the kernel of my position. Good governance has eight major characteristics. It is participatory, consensus oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law. \nIt assures that corruption is minimized and that the voices of the most vulnerable in society are heard in decision-making. It is also responsive to the present and future needs of society. Deficits in these areas give rise to conflict and set back human development. Deficits in these areas are the reasons for our developmental woes. \nThese concepts I have enunciated actually remain my guiding principle in the political arena. At 54, I cannot change this principled position that is clearly founded on deep conviction.” \nView about zoning in the state: The zoning arrangement presupposes that the governorship position in Anambra State be rotated among the three senatorial districts in the state. \nRecall that at the inception of democracy in 1999, Dr. Chinwoke Mbadinuju from Anambra South senatorial district was elected as governor. He spent a single term of only four years in office, as he was not re-elected for a 2nd term in 2003 on grounds of non-performance. \nBetween 2003 and 2014, a period of 11 years, Anambra Central Senatorial District held power with Sen. (Dr.) Chris Nwabueze Ngige holding office for a period of about three years and Sir Peter Obi holding office for a consecutive two tenures of 8 years. Chief Willie M. Obiano from Anambra North Senatorial District has done a 1st term and not having performed well, the Anambra South Senatorial District should be given the opportunity to complete their truncated 2nd term. \nThere is currently a preponderance of politicians from the Anambra North Senatorial District claiming that the incumbent Governor, Chief (Dr.) Willie M. Obiano has disappointed them with his abysmal non-performance and should step aside to give another person from Anambra North a chance. \nHowever, considering the fact that Anambra Central Senatorial District has had 11 years in power and the North has had a single term of four years with an overwhelming agreement on lack of confidence and abysmal non-performance, equity requires that the Anambra South Senatorial District, precisely the Ihiala L.G.A where Dr. Chinwoke Mbadinuju comes from should be given the opportunity of completing a second term in office. \nWhy he quit PDP: Following the impunity and impositions in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the formation of a formidable opposition, i.e. the All Progressives Congress (APC), I joined the APC about three years ago.
