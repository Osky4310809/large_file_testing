That is the warning from hedge fund manager Doug Kass, who writes why investors should short the entire sector . Kass, also a frequent contributor to Jim Cramer's TheStreet media empire, warns of several indicators that the U.S. economy is in fact weak. A major pain point for American banks in housing, which Kass argues is not doing as well as many believe. \"The evidence continues to mount that the U.S. home market has reached an inflection point in price and activity. Housing remains a meaningful source of revenue for the commercial banking industry,\" he writes, adding that higher mortgage rates will limit demand for home loans and thus hurt banks, despite the market view that higher interest rates are in banks' best interests. That is beginning to translate into lower stock prices for financial firms, but the trend is just beginning; according to Kass, \"financial stocks, despite their popularity, already are starting to weaken and potentially roll over in the face of growing threats that few are heeding.\" Banks have already begun to suffer a turn in sentiment. Investment banks The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ( GS ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) fell over 2 percent on Tuesday, while regional banks such as KeyCorp ( KEY ), U.S. Bancorp ( USB ) and BB&T Corporation ( BBT ) saw similar losses. Insurance firms Manulife Financial Corporation ( MFC ) and Prudential Financial, Inc. ( PRU ) saw even steeper losses. While PRU remains up slightly year to date, the stock lost 3 percent of value on Tuesday and is 7.6 percent lower than its 52-week high, which the stock reached at the beginning of March. PRU shares remain up over 41 percent over the past year, with virtually all other financial stocks up over the same period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:23:52.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
