This is coupled with a claimed torque figure of 61.7 Nm at 10,500 rpm, all coming from a 599 cc, DOHC, liquid-cooled inline-four. \nWith Honda removing the CBR600RR from its line-up this year, and Suzuki following suit with the GSX-R600 , only Yamaha and Kawasaki are left from the Japanese big four that still offer a pure 600 cc supersports machine in the catalogue. With the Kawasaki ZX-6R overdue for an update, Yamaha has been pro-active and done this to the YZF-R6. \nComing with six-mode traction control, and an additional “off” mode for track use, Yamaha has built-in traction control to suit all levels of rider. The software is designed to eliminate any unnatural feeling when it intervenes, and also compensates for rear tyre wear to give consistent performance. \nThis is coupled with the YZF-R6’s up-shift only quickshifter, to give efficient acceleration through the six-speed gearbox. Up front, the R6 gets a front end with styling cues taken from Yamaha’s flagship superbike, the YZF-R1. \nOn the suspension side of things, 43mm YZF-R1 type front forks with YZF-R6 specific settings are installed, working together with 320 mm diameter YZF-R1 type front brakes with radial four-pot calipers. Suspension is fully-adjustable front and rear, where the back is suspended with a KYB monoshock. \nNew for 2017 is an aluminium 17-litre fuel tank that shaves weight on the YZF-R6, while also aiding rider movement and at the same time giving the rider grip when in the racing position. A magnesium sub-frame shaves more grammes off the YZF-R6, reducing weight by 1.2 kg over a similar steel assembly, and bringing wet weight to 190 kg. \nThis weight-loss also extends to the magnesium engine head and case covers, and the aluminium frame and swingarm. A titanium exhaust end-can caps off the Yamaha YZF-R6, emphasising the reason for this machine is performance and handling. \nComing in Race Blu and Tech Black, the YZF-R6 will come with an extensive range of official performance accessories, some of which are intended for racing purposes only. The 2017 Yamaha YZF-R6 will be released worldwide in April. However, our source in Hong Leong Yamaha Malaysia has confirmed that the YZF-R6 will not be officially imported.
