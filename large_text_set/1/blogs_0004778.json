Jackson) declared before violently ending a low-level criminal named Brett in Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction . Brett was dining on a Big Kahuna burger. “This is a tasty burger,” Jules determined after trying a bite. For Tarantino fans who have been wanting their own taste of Big Kahuna, this video is here to help. Our YouTube chef notes the actual burger shown in Pulp Fiction doesn’t appear to be all that interesting, so he starts with a simple smashed burger: a two-ounce beef patty cooked on cast iron , topped with American cheese, and served on a plain bun with ketchup. But, because Big Kahuna is supposed to be a “Hawaiian burger joint,” he also whips up a double-stack topped with caramelized onion and pineapple, Monterey Jack cheese, ketchup, and teriyaki sauce, served on a King’s Hawaiian bun. Watch to see how it all comes together, and be thankful you aren’t sharing your burger with Jules.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:40:59.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
