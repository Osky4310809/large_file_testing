She hasn’t been on TV for over a week. Fact they might put her back on TV at some point doesn’t change that. https://t.co/jlSoixx5Fc \n— Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) February 22, 2017 \n\nYou do have to admire the White House press strategy… Don’t respond til after the story posts, then do something to imply it’s not true…\n— Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) February 22, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:31:33.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
