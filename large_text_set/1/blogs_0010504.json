They sat there by the fence with their hands on each others shoulders as if mourning and consoling each other. \nThe photo was taken by Monica Szczupider, a worker at the rescue center. She said Dorothy the chimp was well into her thirties when she died of heart failure after being ill. \nSzczupider said: \n“This is a funeral shot. We were burying Dorothy. We brought her in the wheelbarrow to let the others see. \n“It was unbelievably emotional. We were all struck. Even the employees, all of whom grew up as villagers potentially eating apes, before they were a delicacy, were emotional. \n“I think every last one of us was silenced by their silence.” \nR.I.P. Dorothy. \nPhoto and story: TheSun.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:43:35.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
