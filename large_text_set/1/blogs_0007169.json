A beautiful, moving, funny and unique feature-length documentary on the agony and the ecstasy of making people laugh. A stand-up comedian must be the writer, the director and the star performerâ€”and in stand-up there is no rehearsal, no practice, no safety net, as it only works in front of a live audience, with feedback being instantaneous and often brutal. For most people, baring their soul on stage and having an audience â€œbooâ€� at you would become a life-long trauma, but for stand-up comedians, itâ€™s a nightly challenge. The funny and heartfelt documentary contains original interviews interlaced with personal footage of life on the roadâ€”all from a comedian’s point of view. Once you take this step behind the curtain, you will never look at these funny folks the same way again. Directed by: Lloyd Stanton, Paul Toogood Starring: Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Amy Schumer, Kevin Hart, Jamie Foxx, Sarah Silverman, Jerry Lewis, Steve Coogan, Garry Shandling  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T04:36:05.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
