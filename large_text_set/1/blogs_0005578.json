After all, this is the kid who brought in his own ring light when he retook his yearbook photo so his highlighter would pop in his senior portrait. \nIf you need further proof that he knows how to have fun with beauty then check out the latest video from CoverGirl . The brand's first male spokesmodel got to sit down and geek out over makeup with one of his biggest idols and the current face of the brand, Zendaya . The pair were challenged to use CoverGirl's latest eyeshadow palettes, liners, and mascaras to create a gorgeous jewel tone eye in only ten minutes. \nWhile Zendaya took a more concentrated approach, Charles walked viewers through each step of his process in specific detail. \"You can tell he does videos because he has all the right wording,\" she says with a laugh. \nThis isn't the first time this duo has gotten to bond over their love of makeup. Their friendship first began in July of 2016 when Charles posted a look inspired by the entertainer on his Instagram account. She soon took notice and a friendship was formed. In fact, it was Z who recommended Charles for the first-ever title of CoverBoy. Which, coincidentally, happens to be one of our favorite things about beauty: the strong sense of community it forms, especially within Instagram and YouTube blog-o-sphere. \nWe hope videos like these are just the beginning of what's to come from these two amazing stars, because the results are as entertaining as they are educational. Watch and try not to smile. \nRelated Stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:30:34.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
