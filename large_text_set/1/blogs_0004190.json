He started at Condé working the corporate side where he helped develop apps for the company.\nFor the past four years, Dadich worked out of San Francisco as the top editor of Wired, amassing a basketful of awards, including 10 Webby awards, 50 medals from the Society of Publications Designers and four National Magazine Awards.\nBut the 40-year old editor was always seen as a restless soul. “We always felt he was on his way to the next big thing,” said one veteran who has worked with him.\nThompson is no slouch in the tech side of editorial either. He was a senior editor at Wired from 2005 to 2010 before joining the New Yorker as a senior editor. He was eventually tapped as the editor of newyorker.com four years ago, where he oversaw an eight-fold increase in readers.\nNicholas Thompson Getty Images While at Wired, Thompson edited the story, “The Great Escape,” which eventually was developed into the Hollywood film, “Argo.”\n“Wired focuses on one of the most important issues in the world” — how technology is changing our lives,” said Thompson, who officially takes over on Jan. 30.\nThe New Yorker is now scrambling to find a replacement to head its digital operations.\nDadich is forming Godfrey Dadich Partners, described as a “strategy, content and design firm” in partnership with Patrick Godfrey, who founded the b2b agency, Godfrey Q. The existing Godfrey Q , which employs about 70 people, will become Godfrey Dadich Partners on Feb. 1.\n“No one can see the future, but I know I’m happiest when I’m chasing it — that’s why I’ve loved creating a new Wired every single day,” said Dadich in a statement on his departure.\n“Covering the worlds of business and technology, however valuable, is watching from the sidelines. I felt it was time to get in the game with my own company,” he added.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:05:28.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
