Aaron Kromer is here in Mobile with the #Rams contingent. He's going to be their offensive line coach. \n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 24, 2017 \nThe Rams recently hired Greg Olson, who the team was linked to as a potential offensive coordinator, as their quarterback coach. \nAs such, McVay (who turned 31 today) is adding necessary experience to his coaching staff.

Additionally, he coached their offensive line for multiple seasons and was also briefly their running backs coach. \nHe was a senior assistant and offensive line coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and was also an offensive line coach for the Oakland Raiders and Northwestern.
