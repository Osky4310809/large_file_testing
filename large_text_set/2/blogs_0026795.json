US actor Mahershala Ali, winner of the Best Supporting Actor award for ‘Moonlight’, poses with his Oscar as he arrives to the Vanity Fair Party following the 88th Academy Awards at The Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, California, on February 26, 2017 \n“There’s a mistake. Moonlight, you won Best Picture,” Jordan Horowitz, La La Land producer, announced to the gasps of a shocked crowd. He held up the card clearly showing the winner was Moonlight. However, after the mix-up was corrected, the actor stepped in and explained how it happened. “I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, “La La Land.” That’s why I took such a long look at Faye … I wasn’t trying to be funny. This is “Moonlight” the Best Picture,” he clarified. \nYoungest winner of the Oscar \nAside from that moment, there were many firsts at the 2017 Oscars. Not only did Emma Stone and Viola Davis nab their first Oscars, “La La Land” director Damien Chazelle also scored his first, becoming the youngest winner of the Oscar for Best Director. \n\nHis film went on to win six awards. Oscar-nominated singer Justin Timberlake kicked off the show, performing “Can’t Stop The Feeling!” which he wrote for the animated film, “Trolls.” He high-fived Oscar winners Halle Berry and Denzel Washington while closing his performance with a rendition of Bill Withers’ 1977 classic, “Lovely Day.” \nTimberlake then threw the mic literally to host Jimmy Kimmel, whose opening monologue, which had the audience laughing, included a serious note. “The country is divided right now,” he said. “If everyone of you took a minute to reach out to one person you disagree with and have a positive conversation … as Americans … we could make America great again.” \nThere were other stand-out moments during the Oscars. Here are some of our favourites in no particular order:Diversity in the awards race But beyond the mistake, this year’s Oscars saw more blacks carting away awards with Mahershala Ali and Viola Davis leading the way. \nBoth performers took their first Oscar trophies in the supporting categories, marking the first time since the 2007 ceremony that more than one black actor has won a competitive Academy Award on the same night; Mahershala Ali ,43, triumphed for his work in Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight, while Davis nabbed her first Oscar for her co-starring turn as Rose Maxson in Denzel Washington’s August Wilson adaptation Fences — a role that won her a Tony Award in 2010. \n\nAs if the win weren’t special enough for Ali, who also welcomed his first child this week, he is now in a distinguished class of award winners alongside his role model, Washington, who he says is “on par with the very best.” \n\nThe actor thanked his acting teachers, who prepared him for the role in the coming-of-age film centered on a young black man, growing up in Miami while dealing with his sexuality and his mother’s drug addiction. “I had so many wonderful teachers,” he said on stage, adding that they reminded him that when acting “it’s not about you. It’s about these characters. \nYou’re a servant. You’re in service … to these stories and I’m so blessed to have had an opportunity.” Speaking of his wife, he said, “I just want to thank her for being such a soldier during this process.” Viola Davis unforgettable speech: In a moment that likely surprised no one, “Fences” star Viola Davis took home the Oscar for Best actress in a supporting role. Davis beat out the likes of fellow nominees Naomie Harris for Moonlight, Nicole Kidman for Lion, Octavia Spencer for Hidden Figures, and Michelle Williams for Manchester by the Sea. The actress took her moment to inspire the audience about a speech, which centered on what it means to be an artist.”There’s one place with all the people with the greatest potential are gathered and that’s the graveyard,” Davis began.“People ask me all the time what kind of stories do you want to tell Viola and I say, ‘Exhume those bodies. \nExhume those stories; the stories of the people who dream big and never saw those dreams to fruition, people who fell in love and lost.” “I became an artist and thank God I did because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life,” she continued. \nBest foreign language film \nDavis ended her speech by thanking August Wilson, who wore the play “Fences,” which was adapted to the big screen, and her family.‘ \nThe Salesman’ Director after protesting Trump’s travel ban: Iranian director Asghar Farhadi took home the Oscar award for best foreign language film. Still, he was back in his homeland, protesting President Donald Trump’s travel ban. Iranian-American engineer Anousheh Ansari accepted the award on his behalf, Sunday night, using the moment to shed light on religious discrimination. “Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear,” she said. “A deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. \nFilmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions. They create empathy between us and others. An empathy which we need today more than ever. Thank you on behalf of Mr. Farhadi.” Lin-Manuel Miranda Performs With “Moana” Star Auli’i Cravalho“Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda brought a little hip hop to the Academy Awards when he performed with 16-year-old Auli’i Cravalho. \nThe two performed his Oscar-nominated song “How Far I’ll Go” from the Disney animated film. Wearing a red floor-length gown, Cravalho stood out on the stage, which was transformed to mimic the blue ocean. Kevin O’Connell Finally Wins Oscar After 21 Nods \nThe drought is over. Kevin O’Connell, who was nominated for sound mixing “Hacksaw Ridge,” making it his 21st nod, finally took home the coveted trophy. “Oh my gosh. Guys, thank you so much. I can’t even tell you what this means to me,” a shocked O’Connell said during his acceptance speech. \nHe later noted during his speech how his late mother, Skippy, got him his first sound mixing job 39 years ago.“I asked her, ‘Ma, how can I ever thank you?’ She looked at me and she said, ‘You know, I’ll tell you how you can thank me. \nYou can work hard. You can work really hard and then someday, you go win yourself an Oscar and you can stand up there on that stage and you can thank me in front of the whole world,’” he recalled. “Mom, I know you’re looking down on me tonight. So thank you.” Jimmy Kimmel Brings a Hollywood Tour Inside Dolby Theatre \nA group of film lovers who were on a tour of Hollywood got an unexpected surprise when their tour led them inside Dolby Theatre, courtesy of the show’s host Jimmy Kimmel. \nAmong the group were an engaged couple who are big fans of Oscar-nominated actor Denzel Washington. After Kimmel suggested Washington be in their wedding, the “Fences” star took it one step further and officiated an impromptu wedding. “I now pronounce you husband and wife,” Washington said, standing in between the couple. “You may kiss the bride.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:17:56.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
