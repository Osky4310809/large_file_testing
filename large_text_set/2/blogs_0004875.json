Lorenzo Reyes , USA TODAY 1:05 a.m. ET Feb. 5, 2017 CLOSE x Share USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes believes Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time, regardless of the outcome of Super Bowl LI. USA TODAY Sports QB Tom Brady, left, and coach Bill Belichick both joined the Patriots in 2000. (Photo: Charles Krupa, AP) \nHOUSTON — A crowd about 50 deep awaited. Cameras sat stationed, reporters jockeyed for position. \nFinally, as Tom Brady approached the riser from which he would give his second press conference of Super Bowl week, he heard a familiar voice. Bill Belichick was just around the corner, holding court at his own media session. \nBrady couldn’t resist. He poked his head around the room divider at the New England Patriots' hotel, saw his boss answering questions and chuckled. Even then, Brady was keeping tabs on the most important collaborator he has ever known. \nFor 17 years — easily several job cycles elsewhere in the NFL — the quarterback and coach have been tied together, lifting the Patriots into the most dominating force in the NFL. \nMORE COVERAGE: Super Bowl 51 matchups to watch: Can Patriots ground Julio Jones, Falcons? \nNow, as the duo embarks on a seventh Super Bowl appearance together — with a fifth ring on the line if they beat the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday — their bond continues to be the driving force behind the Patriot Way, the team’s long-established culture. \n“They have the utmost respect for each other,” former Patriots and current Indianapolis Colts place kicker Adam Vinatieri told USA TODAY Sports this week. “Bill is pretty good at throwing criticism in every direction and not saving anybody from it. Tom might go 19 of 20 for 400 yards and four touchdowns, but Bill might give him juice about the one he threw badly. \n“In saying that, I think they’ve got a trust in the sense that even if things go the wrong way, they know each other, they trust each other. It’s almost like that brother relationship: You can give each other a hard time, and you can yell at each other, but there’s no love lost. Feelings don’t get hurt.” \nThe partnership thrives because both men are wired so similarly. They each hold an obsessive compulsion to win. They detest inefficiency and lack of effort. They devote hours to preparation. They go through strategy and meet — just the two of them, in Belichick’s office — before each game. \nOn rare occasions, they’ll socialize. Two years ago, Belichick and Brady played a round of golf at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. \n“He gave me a pretty good licking there,” Belichick later told David Letterman. \nThe foundation of their relationship, however, is spent inside the walls of the Patriots facility inside Gillette Stadium. \n“Those two guys are the constants,” former Patriots linebacker and ESPN analyst Tedy Bruschi said. “No matter what players are there, no matter who leaves, it doesn’t matter if somebody gets hurt or something changes — those two guys are the constants that make sure the game plan is good. And when you’ve got them on the field, you have a great chance of winning a lot of games.” \nMORE COVERAGE: Fifteen years ago, the Patriots were the dynasty no one saw coming \nThat trust was formed back in 2001, Brady’s first season as New England's starter. A sixth-round draft pick in 2000, he played in one game during his rookie year but stepped into the breach the next season when starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe took a vicious hit in Week 2 against the New York Jets. \nBrady never relinquished the job, even when Bledsoe fully healed, because he continued to lead the Patriots to victories, going 11-3 in 2001 before guiding New England to its first championship in Super Bowl XXXVI. \n“Tom was a hard-working grinder,” former Patriots linebacker and NFL Network analyst Willie McGinnest said. “I don’t think you hand the keys over to him if he finishes .500 in the games he played in. I think throughout the course of the year, he built — not only Bill’s trust — but all of our trust. By the time Drew was healthy, I think there were two weeks left in the season and, by then, we knew that we could win with Tom.” \nEven after he had established himself as the franchise quarterback, Brady approached the job with unwavering relentlessness, as if constantly needing to prove himself. \n“All Tom wants to do is win,” offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels told USA TODAY Sports. “All Bill wants to do is win. And however we need to do that, we don’t really much care. We’re going to do our part to get that done.” \nThat competitive drive always appealed to Belichick, a person known to celebrate the toil of grunt work. \n“He’s able to put it all together better than any player that I’ve ever coached,” Belichick said this week in a press conference. “Putting all that together at once in just a couple of seconds of time, he has to process it once he gets the calls and gets to the line of scrimmage. I think his preparation allows him to, in part, do that. He has the football instincts as well. He’s a great role model for all of us — any player and any coach. All of us.” \nBrady’s numbers are staggering. He has started 235 regular-season games and won 183 of them. He's passed for 61,582 yards (4th all time), and 456 touchdowns (also 4th). \nIn the postseason, it’s even more impressive. \nBrady holds playoff records for touchdown passes (61), passing yards (8,628), completions (788), and victories (24 in 33 starts). No other player has appeared in seven Super Bowls. \nBelichick will coach in his seventh Super Bowl as a head coach, which will also be most in NFL history. If the Patriots win, his fifth championship will break the record for a head coach, surpassing Hall of Famer Chuck Noll. \nBut it’s impossible to separate Belichick and Brady when attempting to determine who has been more important to New England’s success. \n“We have always got along so well, and I think that the focus has always been on the team,” Brady said earlier this week. “He commits his life to coaching football and to coaching this team. I commit my life to playing football for this team and playing quarterback. \n“I know Coach loves to coach, and I love to play, and I love playing for him. And I want to go out and win this game for not only him, but all my coaches, teammates and all our fans. We worked hard to get to this point, and we just have to go finish the job.” \n*** \nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes \nPHOTOS: Patriots' road to Super Bowl LI Facebook   Week 1: Playing in their first contest without Tom Brady after the quarterback's four-game Deflategate suspension, the Patriots surprised many with a 23-21 road win at the Arizona Cardinals.

Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 2: The Patriots were dealt more quarterback drama in a 31-24 win over the Miami Dolphins, as Jimmy Garoppolo threw for three touchdown passes but exited in the second quarter with a shoulder injury.

The shutout was New England's first since 2012. Greg M. Cooper, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 4: The Patriots couldn't escape Tom Brady's suspension unscathed, as they fell 16-0 to the Buffalo Bills in the final game before his return.

Winslow Townson, Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 5: In his first game back from suspension, Tom Brady helped the Patriots coast to a 33-13 win over the Cleveland Browns.

Ken Blaze, USA TODAY Sports Making his home debut in 2016, Tom Brady once again was sharp with 376 yards and three touchdowns in a 35-17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. Tight end Rob Gronkowski had a career-high 162 yards and one touchdown. Stew Milne, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 7: Ben Roethlisberger's absence soured what was supposed to be one of the season's marquee matchups, but the Patriots handled their business in a 27-16 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. LeGarrette Blount powered the offense with 127 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Jason Bridge, USA TODAY Sports Week 8: A 41-25 win over the Buffalo Bills sent the Patriots into the bye on a high note. New England scored 27 points on five consecutive possessions to break the game open. Kevin Hoffman, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 10: The Seattle Seahawks got Super Bowl XLIX revenge with a 31-24 win over the Patriots. Rob Gronkowski, who would play just one more game before being placed on injured reserve, was unable to haul in a potentially game-tying touchdown in the final moments. Greg M. Cooper, Greg M.

Baltimore rallied from a 23-3 deficit, but a 79-yard fourth-quarter connection to Chris Hogan helped put the game out of reach. Stew Milne, USA TODAY Sports Week 15: The Patriots stopped the defending champion Denver Broncos dead in their tracks with a 16-3 win. Denver couldn't break through against a staunch New England defense that forced three turnovers. Isaiah J. Downing, USA TODAY Sports Week 16: After a close call in the first matchup, the Patriots had little trouble dispatching the New York Jets in a 41-3 Christmas Eve rout.

Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports Divisional round: The Houston Texans didn't fare much better in their second shot against the Patriots, falling 34-16. Dion Lewis had three touchdowns (receiving, kickoff return, running) and New England's defense once again flustered Brock Osweiler.
