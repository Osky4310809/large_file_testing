The new law completed the Second Amendment’s intention: If you own it, you can carry it. However you like. On your person, in a vehicle, loaded or unloaded, concealed or open. \n“Despite the best efforts of (former New York City Mayor) Michael Bloomberg-funded groups to distort the truth, the New Hampshire legislature and governor stood strong for freedom,” the National Rifle Association said of the new law. “It’s encouraging to see a governor stand up for the rights of his constituents, instead of caving to the demands of an anti-gun billionaire from New York City.” \nThe new law reflects a growing trend in the U.S. At least 11 states currently allow concealed carry without a permit, and legislation to follow suit should be heard in another 16 states this year, according to The Washington Post .   \nIt’s a good start, but gun carry laws to vary from state to state. For this reason, New Hampshire’s new law preserves permits for those who want them, extending current permits without raising fees so that travelers can comply with other states’ reciprocal permit agreements. \nThere are restrictions, of course. In order to carry the weapon, you must own it and not be legally prohibited from doing so by New Hampshire law. \nThe economic benefits of constitutional carry are substantial. \n“This is now the third New England state to have such laws with next to little bureaucratic financial nightmare attached to it. Our neighbors to the north are able to use their tax dollars for fixing roads or other needs the state may have,” said Scott Wilson, president of Connecticut Citizens Defense League.
