It is necessary to satisfy the curiosity and answer the question in the minds of many for quite some time. \n“The world has gone advanced, cellular examination can be used to establish the claim or otherwise of this kind of believe. In this modern time, such claims of relationship should not be left in the domain of mythological theories alone There is need to subject the claim to scientific proof. \n“If at the end of the day, it is confirmed that we are relations, we would remain brothers and friends, but if it proved negative we remain friends. My curiosity is based on the fact that I studied Anthropology as well as Medicine, the result of the cell examination is expected to be out in August this year.” Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:54:54.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
