When they first met, Tsu'tey wanted to kill Jake for being one of the Sky People. Their rivalry grows after Jake and Neytiri begin to fall in love with one another, despite the fact that Tsu'tey and Neytiri were betrothed to mate and rule the Omaticaya clan together. When Jake and Neytiri eventually mate, both of her parents show disappointment while Tsu'tey is enraged and tries to kill Jake. When Jake reveals his mission to the clan, Tsu'tey and his warriors bind Jake and Grace for his betrayal. However, when Jake becomes the sixth Toruk Makto and pledges allegiance to the Omaticaya people, Tsu'tey lets go of his grudge against Jake and comes to respect him. Tsu'tey and Jake fight side by side in the final battle. Tsu'tey is fatally wounded in the battle. After the Na'vi defeat the RDA forces, Jake finds a dying Tsu'tey, who admits that he was proud to fight with Jake and considered him a brother. With great reluctance, Jake grants Tsu'tey a merciful death at his request. Mo'at \nMo'at is partially the reason that Jake is accepted into the Omaticaya clan. She is curious about him, because he is the first warrior to go into an avatar body. Mo'at encouraged Jake's learning of the Na'vi culture and even allowed Grace into the village at his request because of his progress. She is initially displeased that Jake and Neytiri mate, but later comes to feel better about it. When the RDA attacks Hometree, Mo'at frees Jake and Grace from their bonds and begs them to save the clan. When Jake becomes Toruk Makto, she is amazed, and she realizes he was a good mating choice for Neytiri. Mo'at also performs the ritual that allows Jake to be permanently transferred into his avatar body. Parker Selfridge \nJake originally sees Parker as a boss whom he can trust and Parker views him likewise as a capable asset. However, as Jake begins to trust Grace Augustine and get closer to the Na'vi, he breaks his ties with Parker, viewing him as a cold and greedy businessman. Even when this occurs, Jake sees Parker as someone who could be negotiated out of predicaments. This is best seen when Jake convinces Parker to let him and Grace go back into their avatar bodies to try to evacuate the Na'vi. Parker is amongst the humans whom Jake and the Na'vi exile from Pandora. Trudy Chacon \nJake sees Trudy as both an ally and a good friend, another former marine looking for a new lease on life. She is the pilot who brings Jake and the avatar team to the Hallelujah Mountains to separate themselves from the main RDA facility. She is a pilot at the attack on the Hometree, but can't bring herself to fire and returns to the base. With assistance from Max Patel, she frees Jake, Norm and Grace from RDA captivity and helps them relocate the camp in the Hallelujah Mountains to a site near the Tree of Souls. She flies her Samson, adorned with war paint, in the final battle with the RDA under the call sign \"Rogue 1\". She distracts Quaritch's Dragon Assault Ship away from Jake and manages to damage the Dragon before being disabled and then ultimately killed by Quaritch. Max Patel \nMax is one of the few humans on Pandora that Jake truly trusts. Max was the scientist who told Grace of Quaritch's intentions for Jake, causing the team to move locations. Over time, Max becomes Jake's friend. Max, along with Trudy, helps Jake, Norm, and Grace escape from Hell's Gate. He is then appointed Jake's inside man. After the final battle, Max is one of the few humans allowed to stay on Pandora. Eytukan \nJake seems to respect Eytukan, who conducts his initiation ceremony into the clan, and seems honoured to accept Jake as one of the Omaticaya people. Eytukan also seems to return Jake's respect and listens attentively when Jake tries to warn the Na'vi that the RDA is planning to destroy Hometree, but when Jake is thought to be a traitor after revealing his mission, Eytukan, infuriated, orders both Jake and Grace to be bound as he and the clan's warriors prepare to defend Hometree against the RDA. When Eytukan dies in the assault, Jake feels sadness and tries to comfort Neytiri, only to be rejected by her until he proves where his loyalties lie upon taming a toruk. Tom Sully \nJake's relationship with his brother is unknown, and when Jake sees Tom's recently deceased body, he appears disturbed but shows little emotion. Jake takes Tom's place as an avatar driver on Pandora. When Grace tells Jake that she needs his brother upon their first meeting, Jake bluntly replies that he is dead and refers to his death as a \"big inconvenience\". Whenever Jake spoke of Tom, he would refer to him as \"Tommy\", even after his brother died.
