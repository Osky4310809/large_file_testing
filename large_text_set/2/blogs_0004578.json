Everyone was smiling. Everyone was happy. The men all had erections. And every single one of the women was ovulating left and right.” \nThen Spicer began taking questions while audibly “booing” the press. First up was Glenn Thrush from the New York Times who asked about Trump’s recent executive order on immigration and refugees. Spicer reiterated that it is not a travel “ban,” but Thrush was quick to point out that Trump himself labeled it a “ban” on Twitter. \n“Yeah, exactly, you just said that. He’s quoting you. It’s your words,” Spicer shot back. “He’s using your words when you used the words and he uses them back, it’s circular using of the word and that’s from you.” \nAfter, Spicer chastised Thrush and labeled the entire press corps “Glenn.” \nSeveral more reporters continued to question Spicer about Trump’s executive order. Finally one reporter from the Wall Street Journal flatly asked Spicer if he was OK, to which he responded by charging her with his lectern. \n“Take that! You take it. Take it! Take it!” Spicer screamed. “You cannot come at me like that or I will put you in the corner with CNN.” \nThen the camera flips to a caged Jim Acosta — CNN’s actual White House reporter — who is only wearing a diaper and white t-shirt. \n“We are not fake news,” Costa screams from the cage.

Finally, a reporter asks Spicer about the White House’s decision to exclude any mention of Jews from their statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day. \nThat reporter got sprayed with soapy water from a water gun by Spicer. \n“This is soapy water and I’m washing that filthy lying mouth,” Spicer told the reporter. “That is what I’m doing.” \n“That’s enough for today! Spicy’s gotta go bye-bye right now, I need a big-boy nap,” Spicer concluded. “I will be woken me up exactly one minute before tomorrow’s press conference.” \nWatch the full skit below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T16:44:46.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
