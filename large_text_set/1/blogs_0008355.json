For instructions on how to insult dangerous breasts, see To Mock a Killingbird . \nTo Kill a mockingbird is a coming of age-legal drama-sci-fi-thriller about the loss of innocence set in 1930's Alabama. Although credited to Harper Lee as her only novel, it is believed by many literary scholars and critics to have been ghost written by the restless spirit of Sigmund Freud possessing Truman Capote during one of his infamous lost weekends . Plot summary \nAtticus Finch is just a simple southern lawyer with a gift for sweet talking living down south with his two younguns Scout and her lil brother Jem after the passing of their ma. His oldest Scout is a tomboy that fails to conform to the established gender norms of the community and insists she's going to make her way in life with a gun and her wits end pretending to be a man and enlisting in the army. Atticus takes Scout bird hunting in in the wilderness, but warns her never to kill a Mockingbird, because they inspired Darwin's theory of evolution and the transmutation of species after examining the different types of Mokingbirds unique to different islands in the Galapagos, and are thus sacred to God. Scout wonders why this evolution jazz isn't taught in school and why they still have to go inside of a church every week if Adam was a chimpanzee and God sleeps in on Sundays. Or how come she can't run around without a shirt in the summer like boys: she gets no answer. Scout Jem and their friend Dill tell horror stories about the shut in across the street a deformed psycho axe murderer and find mysterious trinkets like coins rocks and arrowheads left in a hollowed tree stump that the younguns figure must be crows or raccoons. \nIn the middle of the story, Atticus is asked by a judge to defend the young wandering confederate hunter Tom Robinson who is accused of either rape or the far more serious unwritten crime of race mixing with local stereotypical redneck farmer Bob Ewell's daughter Mayella, after he did some work for them and took apart a chiffarobe , kindling the flames of passion inside her lying racist heart. Atticus explains mans origins in Africa and takes the gambit of jury nullification at which point prosecutor William Jennings Bryant falls into his trap and himself takes the stand to debate the literal interpretation of the bible. Atticus asks him if he believes they should arrest King Solomon for loving the Queen of Sheba turning the courtroom into the epicenter of a wave of wisdom that spreads throughout Alabama, turning it into the liberal bastion it is today. Bob Ewell is arrested for molesting his daughter and obstructing justice by ordering his daughter to lie to the court, Tom is set free and allowed to continue on his quest to hunt down the last confederate war criminals and bring them to justice as Mayella becomes the only example of a false rape allegation taught in classrooms and Jem's faith in the system is restored. [ Citation not needed at all; thank you very much ] \nIt seems like all is set for a happy ending as the curtain falls of the schools Halloween play, until on their way walking home they notice a particularly realistic looking decoration of a man hanging from a tree. As they are distracted a knife wielding Klansmen grabs them, and it about to slit Scouts throat when three of their fingers are blown off by Atticus who quips, \"Never bring a knife to a gunfight.\" Atticus unmasks the bleeding Klansmen as none other than Mayella Ewell and asks her why she did it. She explains she's pregnant and the baby is neither her fathers nor Robinsons but the clone of General Lee created through his frozen blood and seed and an electro portation cloning technique developed by Nikolai Tesla. Robinson caught wind of the plan to resurrect the confederacy and once more wage war against the northern aggressors, with Robert E. Lee's clones leading the charge. Imagine it: a General Lee for the 1920's, the 1930's the 1940's! As Mayella maniacally laughed Mayella started coughing up blood, causing Atticus to lower his guard, drop his gun and try to assist her. It was a fools folly as she plucked out his left eye and used him as a human shield. Atticus screams at Scout to take the shot, her hands trembling at the thought of missing and hitting her father. She is about to pull the trigger when an arrow shoots Mayella between the eyes and she drops dead, Boo Radley wearing a sack over his hideous face. Finally the sheriff arrives on the scene and covers up Jason's involvement, blaming the boys killing on the ghosts of Native Americans as he always did. The two bloodstained hands before saying goodbye forever as Scout imagines life entombed in a decaying old house, looking out through the window from behind a hockey mask, sorry she can never repay him for his acts of kindness.
