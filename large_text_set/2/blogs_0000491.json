OFFICIAL: Mamadou Sakho completes a loan switch to #CPFC until the end of the season, which banks #LFC £2m. pic.twitter.com/YYIYGopAu7 — Melissa Reddy (@MelissaReddy_) February 1, 2017 \nThe Eagles will assume full payment responsibility for Sakho’s wages and will hope the process of getting him fully match sharp will be speedy, considering the centre-back’s only outings were for Liverpool’s Under-23s this season. \n\"It was really, really long for me and all my family [to wait for the deal to happen], but now I’m really happy to sign here because the project is really interesting,\" the Frenchman told Palace TV . \n\"It’s a big challenge and I’ve come for that.
