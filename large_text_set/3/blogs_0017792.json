This hair ornament-composed of delicate silver wires bearing tiny opals, demantoid garnets, garnets, and enamel florets-shows the flower in full bloom. Leaves of silver covered in translucent green enamel and copper painted green, visible on the under-side of the piece, increase the impression of naturalism. Whereas jewelry typically made at his father's firm, Tiffany and Company, tended to replicate more formal flowers, such as orchids and irises, and utilized primarily precious stones, Tiffany's use of a common wildflower and semi-precious stones aligns this work with avant-garde Parisian jewelers of the Art Nouveau. Provenance The piece descended in the family of the sellers from their great grandmother Ida E. B. Noyes (Mrs. LaVerne Noyes; d. 1912), a noted philanthropist in Chicago. It descended from Mrs. Noyes to her granddaughter, Elsie H. Page, to her daughters, Martha Dickinson and Helen Anne Kendrick.   \nEssays", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T09:30:06.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
