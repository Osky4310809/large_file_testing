Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nCasey Affleck finally landed himself an Oscar for the family's awards cabinet last night - exactly 20 years after his brother Ben bagged his first golden statuette. \nHe was given the Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Manchester By the Sea, a story about a man who is named guardian of his teenage nephew after the death of his brother. \nFittingly, the first person to congratulate him on his success was his own proud brother, Ben Affleck , who already has two Oscars at home after winning his first in 1997 with Matt Damon for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting. \nWhen Casey's name was read out, he barely had time to react to the news before Ben grabbed him tightly, hugging him and kissing him on the side of his face in an act of sheer pride in his sibling's achievements. \nCasey didn't look as though he appreciated the sentiment too much, wincing slightly as though he was being squeezed too hard - it's a brother's job to embarrass his younger siblings, right? It was an emotional moment for both men (Photo: REUTERS) \nBen and Casey Affleck moved out to LA together with Matt Damon to pursue their dreams in the movie industry in the 1990s. \nSince his 1997 success, Affleck has won another Academy Award for his film Argo, leaving little brother Casey the only one without a gold statue for two decades. Look how proud that face is! (Photo: Rex) \nHistorically, it's the first time brothers have won separate Oscars in separate categories. \nIn a previous interview with Access Hollywood, Ben said: \"I'm just rooting for him, I'm just hoping he gets nominated. \n\"It's a long way away and it's a long shot but it couldn't happen to a better guy.\" \n\"I'm happy that a guy who I always knew was a great actor - who I put in my first movie because I knew he was a great actor - is getting the recognition.\" \nHowever, there was some family awkwardness after Casey's Golden Globe win - when he forgot to thank or mention Ben completely. \nAmerican TV host Jimmy Kimmel pointed out to Ben in an interview that Casey had thanked Matt Damon, Denzel Washington and even the company Amazon.
