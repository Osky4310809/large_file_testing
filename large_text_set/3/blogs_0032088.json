Barack [Obama] and I won them. Let's get this straight. They weren't racist. They voted for a black man twice in a row.\"\nBack in December, Biden made similar comments about Clinton and the Democratic Party, saying in an interview they were unwilling to craft a message that resonated with the white working class.\nThere is \"â€˜a bit of elitism that's crept in' party thinking,\" he told the Los Angeles Times , while arguing voters who supported Trump are not bigoted.\n\"They're all the people I grew up with. They're their kids. And they're not racist. They're not sexist. But we didn't talk to them,\" Biden said.\nThe former vice president is set to lead the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.\nThe post Biden Hits Clinton for Ignoring Middle Class During Election appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:02:21.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
