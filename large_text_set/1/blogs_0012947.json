Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe heartbroken mum of a teenage suicide victim who was groomed by a sex predator believes the paedo left her daughter to die and \"used her for kicks\". \nBritney Mazzoncini, 16, was found dead in July after suffering a torrent of vile online bullying . \nDevastated mum Annette McKenzie now says paedophile Barry Duffin – locked up this week for abusing three schoolgirls – knew Britney had taken an overdose but didn’t call for help. \nAnnette has shared private messages between the two, showing the chilling moment Britney revealed she had taken all of her prescription medication and was struggling to breathe. \nAnnette said that instead of calling for help, Duffin continued to speak to her and message her until she died at her home in Hillington, Glasgow, the Daily Record reports. \nDuffin, 18, from Paisley, was given four-and-a-half years and branded “a risk to women” after being convicted of abusing a 13-year-old girl and “wearing down” two girls aged 14 and 15 until they agreed to have sex.

I have asked everyone who knew Britney how she met this man but no one can tell me. \n“The only conclusion I have come to is that he has seen a comment Britney made on Facebook then contacted her directly through that.” \nWhen the phone was returned to Annette, she checked Britney’s Facebook Messenger. She was devastated to find Duffin spoke to her daughter by phone and on Facebook Messenger until her last breath.

He offered to organise and pay for a taxi to pick them up and take them there. \n“Looking back through the messages, I can see he was contacting her, telling Britney his problems to make her feel sorry for him. She was messaging back, trying to be supportive. \n“On July 5, Britney fell out with her boyfriend. She had mentioned this on social media to her friends and all of a sudden Duffin was there messaging her, asking what happened then inviting her to his house. He played on her vulnerability.” \nAnnette couldn’t believe what she was seeing when she realised Britney had messaged Duffin and told him she had taken an overdose. Annette said: “It was a strange exchange. He seemed to know what was going on. \n“There were messages and a Facebook call. Britney seemed to hang up on him and came back with the message, ‘I can’t breathe.’ Sick paedo Barry Duffin was messaging Britney while she was overdosing from prescription drugs (Photo: Police handout) \n“She told him she had taken an overdose then said her insides were burning and she was in pain. He did nothing.” \nDuffin’s reply said: “I’m away to do it now.” This made Annette consider whether there was a suicide pact but only Britney went through with it. \nAnnette said: “Her friend, who had visited Barry Duffin at his house with Britney, was messaging her too, saying she’s looked up on Google what would happen if she took all her medication. \n“One of the messages had Britney saying her friend looked it up and ‘my heart’s going to stop beating’. \n“When Britney goes quiet, around 3am, he panics and demands she texts him back immediately. But she was gone, because I found Britney at 3.17am.” Britney was found dead by her mum in July last year after she took her own life \nAnnette has kept the messages to try to piece together who knew what happened and why. \nShe said: “For now, all I know is that this Barry knew and spoke to Britney while she ended her life instead of helping. I need to know if he really left her to die and used her for kicks.” \nAnnette is now torn apart, wondering whether her daughter might have been saved had someone raised the alarm. \nShe said: “I believe if we had got to Britney, even five or 10 minutes sooner, that we could have done something to save her.” \nAnnette is heading a campaign to stop GPs prescribing strong mental health medication to under-18s without their parents’ knowledge.

She said: “Kids as young as 14 can be given these strong meds if the doctor sees fit, without our knowledge or consent. \n“We thought our daughter was safe under our roof but there was a danger there we had no idea about.” \nSamaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.
