That’s not to mention the hit film and play they inspired. \nAnd now, after six years of work, Take That star Gary Barlow has finally ­realised his dream of their story being his first West End musical. \nBut for some in the audience, it was even more emotional as the family of John Baker, whose death from non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1998 inspired the original calendar, looked on. Calendar Girls has already raised £4million John Baker, husband of WI member Angela Baker, who inspired the show \nWife Angela and children Matthew and Rachel joined the cast – including Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ‘Em star Michele Dotrice and Joanna Riding - on stage for the finale as chart-topper Gary gave a surprise performance. \nFor Matthew, 45, it was also an uplifting ­experience. “The music brings a whole new depth and level of emotion into the story,” he says. “The journey reminds me of the highs and lows of what we, as a family, went through. \n“­People laugh and cry in the audience like we did.” \nNow a solicitor with two daughters, Matthew has only recently been able to watch the film ­version of his real-life family history. \n“At the time, it was all too raw and I felt emotional,” he explains. “It was very sad, but as a lasting legacy to my dad. It’s done a lot of positive things. My father would have a huge smile on his face about all of this.” The cast of Calendar Girls take to the stage in the West End Gary Barlow, Tim Firth, Joanna Riding and the original 'Calendar Girls' (Photo: Getty) \nHis mother Angela, 71, who ­travelled to London from her native Linton, North Yorks, is excited her husband’s memory lives on. \n“It feels amazing to see the show on the West End stage,” she says. \n“The one good thing is that John did know about the calendar, he shook his head and said, ‘You’ll never do it. You’re all talk’. But you don’t say that to a group of feisty, Yorkshire ladies. \n“Without my friends rallying round and organising it we’d have never have done it. But, as they said, it gave me something to do. It’s just been amazing. I think John is smiling.” \nThe WI initially aimed to raise money to buy a sofa in the visitors’ area of the hospital where John was treated. \nSince that first calendar in 1999, the girls have raised nearly £4million for the Bloodwise charity .
