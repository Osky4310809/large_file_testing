It's modeled on the strategies of the right-wing “Tea Party” groups that sprang up to oppose President Obama early in his first term. \nThe Indivisible Guide , a sort of manifesto mashed up with a how-to manual, describes the group as the brainchild of “progressive congressional staffers” seeking to “share insider information” about how citizens can influence Congress to fight the Trump agenda. \n“The election,” noted Strimel, “was a wake-up call.” \nWhile big, loud, occasionally confrontational but mostly peaceful street protests have become a hallmark of what's being called the Trump resistance, the Collingswood event attracted the sort of crowd you'd see at a suburban civic association meeting, or a perhaps a neighborhood park cleanup. \nThe people inside and outside were mostly middle-aged and middle-class; blue-collar folks, senior citizens, younger men and women, people of color and members of the LGBT community were represented as well. \nAnd the agenda was mainstream: More about calling one's member of Congress, than calling for a revolution. \nCopies of the Indivisible Guide were distributed, and inside, small groups of people arranged their chairs in circles to discuss issues of their choosing. \nAmong them were civil rights, the environment and (my favorite), “Trump's attempt to delegitimize the press.” \nBefore and after the event, people I interviewed said they wanted to do more than merely commiserate with like-minded people, or complain. \n“I'm looking for something meaningful,” explained Denise Dunham, 61, a retired educator who lives in Merchantville. \nSome said they had long been involved with liberal causes –“I was at People's Park in Berkeley, back in the day” said Collingswood resident Wendy Decou – while others were relative newcomers to grassroots movements. \n“We're getting educated,” said one older woman, as the people around her nodded. \nThe indoor meeting featured trays of cookies, sign-up sheets, and selfies, and was held in a room where shimmering snowflake decorations hung from the ceiling – an entertaining bit of irony, given the spread of “snowflake” as a derisive term for Trump opponents and other progressives. \nBut the conversations I overheard weren't jargon-filled fantasizing, but pragmatic exhanges about how best to interact with elected officials and get other people involved via social media or face-to-face. \nAnd Mary Page, a stylish 65-year-old retired paralegal, belied the stereotype of snowflakes as fragile, ineffectual creatures still boo-hooing about having lost the election. \nWith a beaming smile, the Berlin Borough resident told me how she had engaged in an impromptu protest about Ivanka Trump's clothing line at the Bloomingdale's outlet last Thursday in Center City. \nShe held up a garment that bore Ivanka's label and announced that it had been made in China, stunning other shoppers before putting it back on the rack and leaving the store. \nHer modest bit of guerilla theater was worth it, Page said, “if I reached one person.” More Coverage ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:55:57.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
