Nonetheless he kept his players going while geeing up the crowd and making attacking substitutions. \nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10 = best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating) \nGK Hugo Lloris, 6 -- Had a strange game in that he was mostly a spectator but conceded twice. He had little chance with either goal though. \nDF Eric Dier, 5 -- Looked unconvincing and defended poorly when Gent scored their late goal. \nDF Toby Alderweireld, 7 -- Was unlucky to concede the corner which led to Gent's equaliser, after a good piece of defending which should have resulted in a goal kick. A player of his calibre should not be exiting the Europa League at this stage. \nDF Jan Vertonghen, 7 -- Got forward whenever he could, including a run into the six-yard box, and in the closing stages he was taking care of the left flank by himself. \nDF Kyle Walker, 6 -- Did well to repeatedly attack Gent and get into good positions, but he should have done more with those opportunities. He could have been the man of the match but his end product was inconsistent. \nDF Ben Davies, 5 -- Ineffective again as the left wing-back, and Spurs improved when he went off. \nMF Victor Wanyama, 8 -- Kept recycling the ball and ensuring Spurs dominated possession, and he showed some of his teammates how to finish with a clinical second-half strike. \nMF Mousa Dembele, 8 -- The Belgian was everywhere and it was Spurs who seemed to have the extra man in the second half. It was something of a surprise when he was substituted 15 minutes from time. Dele Alli's temper reared its head again and it cost Spurs dearly against an inferior Gent team. \nMF Dele Alli, 2 -- Pressed energetically early on as Spurs made a flying start, but he hadn't made much of an impact and had clearly become frustrated when he lunged into a horrible tackle on Brecht Dejaegere which could very easily have broken his opponent's leg. He let his team down badly. \nMF Christian Eriksen, 9 -- Looked sharp from the start and produced a goal and an assist, while also knitting the play together neatly and helping to create a number of other chances. \nFW Harry Kane, 5 -- Scored an unfortunate own goal and was unable to make amends at the other end. He had a particularly big chance when Eriksen played him through on goal just before the hour mark, but shot wide. \nSubstitutes \nMF Son Heung-Min, 7 -- Made a useful impact after replacing Davies just before the hour mark, but he missed a good chance late on. \nMF Harry Winks, N/A -- Came on in place of Dembele for the final 15 minutes but was unable to turn the tie in Tottenham's favour. \nFW Vincent Janssen, N/A - Entered the fray in the 89th minute, with little time to do anything.
