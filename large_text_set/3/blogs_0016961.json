We're told, in addition to also finding Tom's Super Bowl 49 jersey and Von Miller 's helmet, authorities found other items.\nAs for what Ortega has ... it could be a lot, because he's had access to locker rooms at Super Bowls since 2005, and possibly earlier.\nNow here's the crazy part ... if authorities announce other items that were stolen, anyone who purchased them -- even in good faith -- has a legal duty to turn the items over to authorities. Law enforcement sources tell us, if the buyers don't fork over the stolen goods, they could be prosecuted for the crime of receiving stolen property.\nThis kind of stuff happens with high-end collectors. Remember Nic Cage , when he learned a dinosaur skull he bought for $276,000 was stolen, he was legally required to return it and took the loss.", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1119662925?pt=158118&ct=TMZ%20Sports%20Article%20Footer&mt=8"], "published": "2017-03-21T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T10:40:20.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
