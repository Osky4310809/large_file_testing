But, anecdotal evidence definitely shows that having a morning routine is good for the mind, body, and soul. Successful people have a set morning routine. Those who are healthy and youthful in their old age value the first hour or so of their day. And, if you pause to evaluate your own routine, you might find that days when you don't simply jump out of bed, into the shower, and out the door in a rush, turn out to be better than the days that you do. If that's not reason enough, then here are five more reasons why you should set a morning routine... It gives you a sense of control. Feeling that your life is out of control is at the root of anxiety, stress, and even depression. While, yes, we can't control most things in life, we can control how we start the day. Having an hour or so every day that you are in charge of can be empowering, and prep you to deal with all the things that are not in your control. It allows you to have some quiet down time before the day gets hectic. Sure, you can have down time at the end of the day, but that is always tinged with exhaustion and a feeling of surrendering and shutting down, rather than embracing peace and quiet. You can't truly experience the therapeutic power of stillness if you are tired. You can have your much needed 'me time.' Mornings are a good time for that elusive 'me time,' because your family, friends, and colleagues haven't yet started to vie for your attention. They need your time, and they deserve it. But, you need your time just as much, if not more. So, instead of saying no when they want to have a fifteen minute chat about their shoe bite during lunch time, and then feeling guilty about it, use your morning for self-love. It sets the tone for the day. Not in the way that if your morning is relaxed and slow, that's how the rest of the day will be. No. Life happens. You might have the easiest, calmest morning, but the most hectic day. But, starting your day right will help you prepare for the madness of the day ahead! It's good for your health. Skipping breakfast is bad for your health. Not de-stressing is bad for your health. Not exercising is bad for your health. Get the drift? So, now that you're sold on the idea of having a morning routine, here are 10 things that you need to make sure you do in the first hour or so of your day. A cup of hot water. Because it is healthy. It cleanses your body like a magic potion. Breakfast. Having a hearty breakfast keeps your metabolism on track. Movement. Walk, run, stretch... whatever works for you, to get your blood flowing. A morning playlist. Music is a powerful tool. It can set your mood, and change your mood. Have a morning playlist that is upbeat, and makes you happy. Reading. And no, tweets don't count. Read the newspaper, or a book. Your brain needs some exercise as well. Deep breathing. Because it will help you relax, and kick the day off without stress. Gratitude. Take a moment to identify one thing you are grateful for. If you can't think of anything, be grateful for being alive. Your breath is a miracle. Appreciate it. Setting intention. Tao Porchon Lynch, who at 98 is the world's oldest Yoga teacherand a Tango dancer, starts the day by telling herself that this is going to be the best day of her life. That's her secret to her great health, agility, and contagious happiness. Gardening. It doesn't have to be anything extravagant. If you don't have space, just have two plants in your house, and water them every morning. Nature heals. Spend time with a loved one. Even if it is ten minutes. Relationships are central to our well-being. You can have the healthiest of habits, but if you don't have solid relationships that you feel secure in, you are at risk of many health problems. Take time to nurture your relationships. Have a cup of coffee with your flatmate. Call your mother. Cuddle with your partner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T07:10:50.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
