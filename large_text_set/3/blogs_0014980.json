Dianne Feinstein. \nJudge Gorsuch made the case for judicial restraint by citing Charlie Brown: \n“Well senator, that reminded me of, you know, when Charlie Brown is going in to kick the ball and Lucy picks it up at the last second. And that struck me as raising serious due process concerns, fair notice and separation of powers concerns. When a executive bureaucracy can overturn a judicial precedent without an act of Congress.” \nAwesome: \n— Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt)   Heap big hypocrite! Katie Pavlich nukes Elizabeth Warren for trying to shame Betsy DeVos (again) \nWatch: When asked by @SenFeinstein about one of his previous cases, #SCOTUS nominee Neil #Gorsuch answered with a reference to Charlie Brown pic.twitter.com/tqV8psGpU2 \n— PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) March 21, 2017 \nHe’s of course referring to this iconic bit from the Peanuts gang: \nHey, it works for us.
