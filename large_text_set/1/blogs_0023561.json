Both offenses didn’t get a lot going, despite play being pretty calm and light all around, with linemen on both sides of the ball seemingly doing the least. The first quarter went scoreless between the two teams.\nIn the second quarter, we got a quick score as a AFC had been driving down the field. Andy Reid was pretty confident in the play too, as he called the touchdown before it even happened on the broadcast .\nIn the latter part of the second quarter, the NFC finally got on the board after Drew Brees hit Doug Baldwin for a rather easy touchdown:\n. @DougBaldwinJr made this one look easy #WOOTS #Seahawks https://t.co/ttZtQqrx6F \n— Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) January 30, 2017 The game would become more fun though, and it wasn’t necessarily because of scores.\nMichael Bennett sacked Andy Dalton , and brought out his signature sack dance. You know, the one where “Two pumps get you a baby. Three pumps gets you a fine.” \nNever to be outdone, after scoring a touchdown to make it a 14-7 game, Travis Kelce showed us his meme awareness with a Salt Bae touchdown celebration :\nThe AFC would go into the half up 14-7 on the NFC, in a game that lacked an offensive punch. Early in the third quarter, Justin Tucker knocked through a 38-yard field goal to put the AFC up 17-7.\nTucker wouldn’t be finished, as he knocked in another field goal, this one from 31 yards out, only to be matched five minutes later by Matt Prater to make it a 20-10 game.\nThe NFC made another late fourth quarter push, but settled for another Prater field goal to make it a 20-13 game. After forcing the AFC to punt, the NFC would get another chance with just over two and a half minutes left in the game.\nThe NFC put together a good drive, and appeared like they might be in a position to tie the game up. Yet Von Miller and the AFC defense stepped up, and decided that they were going to do what they can to stop them. They did, and did so with an interception that turned into one of the more strange plays you’ll see on a football field that included a lateral, and Kirk Cousins running down Aqib Talib .\nThe AFC would be able to take a knee, and secure the 20-13 win.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T06:25:32.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
