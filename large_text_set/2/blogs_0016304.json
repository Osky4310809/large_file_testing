Now, we have got hold By Rajat Tripathi | Published: February 21, 2017 6:34 pm Kareena Kapoor Khan: All the pizzas, ghee and paranthas have gone into Taimur \nKareena Kapoor Khan had the entire town talking about her, when she chose to break the norm, and flaunt her baby bump, not just at public events, but even on the fashion runway. Now, we have got hold of some new, never seen before pictures of the gorgeous lady, which were taken mid-pregnancy. And she is looking glamorous, and flawless like ever. Or even more. Maybe the pregnancy glow is helping her a little. \nAs we know, Kareena has been announced as the brand ambassador for Sony BBC Earth. She is the ‘Feel Alive’ Ambassador for the new channel and the pictures depict her moods – feeling all alive. We bet you can’t look at these pictures just once. The enigmatic presence of the actress and the fact that she was pregnant with her first child make this campaign a lot more special. We also applaud the producers for keeping the pics under wrap for so long. But just because these pics have been released post-Kareena’s delivery, we are sure it is not going to stop them from going viral. Now, a sincere wait for the final product of the association between Kareena and BBC Earth begins. We are sure it must be as glorious as these campaign pictures.
