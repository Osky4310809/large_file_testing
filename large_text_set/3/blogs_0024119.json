But he did not admit to any wrongdoing in his resignation letters to Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and State Sen. Mike Schulz. Former Oklahoma state Senator Ralph Shortey. Sue Ogrocki / AP \n\"My resignation is evidence of my respect for public service and the duties of our elected officials,\" the 35-year-old Republican said in a statement. \nShortey was already being shunned by his peers. Even before he was charged with a crime, the Oklahoma Senate passed a resolution that suspended nearly all his privileges and scrubbed his name off any legislation he had a hand in —as well as his office door. \nOstensibly a conservative-family-values politician, Shortey was busted after police were notified that he had checked into a Super 8 Motel in Moore, Oklahoma — using his own name — around midnight on March 9 and a boy was with him. \nShortey insisted they were \"just hanging out,\" but police discovered a graphic online exchange in which the disgraced lawmaker asked the 17-year-old if he would be \"interested in sexual stuff.\" \nThe married dad is also charged with engaging in prostitution within 1,000 feet of a church, and transporting a minor for prostitution/lewdness, according to the Cleveland County District Attorney's office. \nA member of the Rosebud Sioux Indian Tribe, Shortey was a staunch supporter of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and part of his leadership team in Oklahoma.
