Obama arrived at the Jacksonville International Airport on Saturday just in time to see Marvin Nicholson, the White House trip director and the president’s personal aide, marry the love of his life. Nicholson and Helen Pajcic tied the knot at a private evening ceremony in Jacksonville at the One Ocean Resort and Spa. Pajcic is the daughter of a longtime Obama fundraiser and – according to her LinkedIn profile – a special assistant at the Education Department. Obama has played 333 rounds of golf since taking office and Nicholson has joined in for 192 of them, making him the president’s most frequent golf buddy. Meanwhile, more than 300 miles away, families are mourning the loss of their loved ones after a gunman opened fire at the Ft Lauderdale Hollywood Airport. Five people died and six more were injured in the shooting that occurred around 1pm on Friday. \nPresident Obama has never understood optics. \nHe did this kind of thing constantly over the last 8 years. \nRemember when he went golfing right after James Foley was beheaded? \nThe guy just doesn’t have a clue how bad this kind of thing looks. \nOr he doesn’t care. \nEither way, it’s not good.
