This is the 2018 Subaru WRX and 2018 WRX STI, which has been revealed in the US. The performance duo will reach American dealers this spring. \nBesides the new lower bumper sporting larger air intakes, the latest WRX and STI also come with a more pronounced grille design. The WRX Limited and all STIs feature redesigned LED Steering Responsive Headlights that help shine into corners. The whole family gets new roof rack mounting brackets. \nThe WRX, shown in red here, is powered by a 268 hp 2.0L turbo boxer engine, paired to the brand’s symmetrical AWD and Active Torque Vectoring. It comes standard with a six-speed manual and the Sport Lineartronic CVT auto as an option. \nNew for model year 2018 is new front/rear suspension tuning for improved steering stability and ride comfort, while retaining cornering ability. Subaru has also ‘significantly enhanced’ shifter feel for the stick, with a new synchro design and reduced friction, along with smoother clutch take-up. The car’s EPS steering has been revised to provide a smoother, more natural feel; while integrating the steering motor and ECU reduces weight. \nA new optional Performance Package for the WRX Premium features Recaro eight-way power seats, red-painted brake calipers, upgraded Jurid brake pads and the deletion of the moonroof to reduce weight. The standard 18-inch wheels feature a nice new double-spoke design. \nThe 2018 WRX STI has gone through a ‘comprehensive handling enhancement’, Subaru says. The 305 hp 2.5L turbo boxer sedan includes the revised suspension tuning from the WRX, plus a revised DCCD AWD system, upgraded brakes and this model’s first-ever standard 19-inch wheels. \nThe DCCD system, which previously used a combination of mechanical and electronic centre LSD control, now uses electronic control for quicker and smoother response. The 19-inch alloys feature a striking Y-shaped spoke design and carry 245/35 tyres that improve cornering performance, and stance. \nThe yellow brake calipers identify a significantly upgraded Brembo system that now uses stronger monoblock six-piston calipers in front, monoblock two-piston calipers in the rear and larger, drilled rotors all around for better heat dissipation. New brake pads provide greater surface area for improved braking feel and fade resistance. The STI also offers the Recaro seats from the WRX Performance Pack, standard on STI Limited, optional for base trim. \nStyling and performance upgrades aside, all models feature upgraded cabin materials, rear seat armrest with cup holders, redesigned interior door grips and faster remote trunk opening. Thicker door glass, revised door sealing and a foam-filled windshield header beam reduce noise. There’s also a new, larger multi-function display – 5.9-inch from 4.3-inch. \nWRX Limited models now feature power driver’s seat lumbar adjustment. The standard WRX adds heated exterior mirrors (standard on higher trims), while the WRX Premium gets a Subaru Starlink 7.0-inch multimedia unit, up from 6.2″. \nLastly, Subaru revised the front structure of the cars for enhanced frontal collision performance. The WRX Limited, when equipped with EyeSight driver assist tech, now features Vehicle Hold (AVH) and a new EyeSight Assist Monitor. \nThe latter uses LED indicators to display EyeSight status and alerts on the windscreen, allowing the driver to see them without taking eyes off the road. AVH, which replaces Hill Holder and Hill Start Assist functions, holds the car on all angles and not only inclines.
