How much of the program will be cut? The Washington Post writes, \"The actual effect of next year’s budget on the program is unclear — in part because Trump’s budget plan is thin on details.\"\nSo, we don't know.\nHowever, a spokesman for Meals on Wheels said the group's donations have surged in response to possible cuts.\nBut private donations have surged in response, a spokeswoman for the group told The Washington Post. The national office has taken in more than $100,000 since the White House announced plans to eliminate the Community Development Block Grant program on Thursday — compared with about $1,000 on a normal day.\nThe Washington Post also informs us that \"Trump’s vague budget outline also could slash the Older Americans Act, which it says funds more than one-third of Meals on Wheels operations across the United States.\"\nSo again, we don't know how much will end up being cut from this program but it sure sounds terrible that Trump wants to slash the Older Americans Act.\nOne of the unintended consequences of the media's hysteria mongering is that it solves the \"problem\" about which they are fear mongering. Concerned citizens are stepping up with charity to help the organization. Charity! Maybe the group doesn't need federal money if it can get support from the private sector?\nThe media knows that Trump isn't responsible for the budget, he's only giving suggested cuts. The budget is one of Congress's powers but the media's job is to gin up anger against and fear about Trump. Looks like it backfired.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/20/meals-on-wheels-sees-donation-surge-following-trump-proposed-cuts/", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2017/03/18/meals-on-wheels-sees-donation-surge-after-trump-proposes-funding-cuts"], "published": "2017-03-20T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:36:20.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
