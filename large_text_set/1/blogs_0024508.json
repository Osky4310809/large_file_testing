Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nRonald Koeman has called on Premier League bosses to follow his lead by giving English kids a chance. \nThe Everton manager believes the talent coming through the country’s academy system is among the best in the world. \nAnd he has urged rival bosses to start putting their trust in homegrown talent ahead of expensive foreign imports. \nKoeman has resisted the temptation to splash too much cash since taking over at Goodison in the summer after recognising the quality of youngsters like Tom Davies and Mason Holgate. Davies netted a memorable goal against Manchester City (Photo: Rex) \nThe Dutchman also spent £7.5million on Charlton’s teenage sensation Ademola Lookman. \nKoeman said: “Clubs in the Premier League have bought many foreign players over the years and I acknowledge that sometimes it is necessary. \n“But here in England, my admiration for the bulk of talent in the academies has grown massively. \n“I admire the attitude, the spirit and the values of young English footballers. They have an incredible desire. Mason Holgate is another to emerge at Goodison this season (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \n“I have no worries about their motivation and I feel I actually have to slow them rather down than push them forward. \n“Young British players have a spirit, which I don’t see in the Netherlands or other countries where I used to work. \n“There is a different culture here. The problem is that managers here wait a long time before they launch young players. \n“If a player has the talent, my motto is that you must give him the stage to show it.

Koeman worked closely with Guardiola at Barca (Photo: VI Images via Getty) \nAnd as coach of Feyenoord he guided the Dutch club to three successive runners-up finishes - despite not being allowed to spend a penny in the transfer market because the Rotterdam giants were on the brink of bankruptcy. \nKoeman then proved at Southampton that it is possible to bring forge youngsters in the heat of Premier League battle. \nAnd he took extra pride from Everton’s recent 4-0 hammering of Guardiola’s Manchester City from having Davies, Holgate and Lookman in the team. \nKoeman said: “The great thing about a young talent like Tom Davies is that the fans immediately take to them. Koeman says fans are immediately drawn to local lads (Photo: PA Wire) \n“They feel a bond with a young player when he is a boy from their hometown. I know what to do with these boys. \n“Against City we finished the game with three players aged 18, 19 and 20 in the side. \n“We won 4-0 and yet after that we sat down with Tom Davies to show him on video where he could improve. \n“Why? I did not need to tell him what he had done right. The whole world had told him that after the game. \n“He needed to learn what he could improve.” \nKoeman has spent £24million this month recruiting midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin from Manchester United.

I want to give them support and confidence. \n“Most clubs who spend big in the January window are in trouble with their league position. \n“We signed Morgan Schneiderlin because He made it clear he wants to play every week. \n“My relationship with him also made the deal a bit easier.” poll loading Will Everton finish in the top six this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T00:49:28.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
