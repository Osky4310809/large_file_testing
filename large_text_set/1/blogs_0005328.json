In a pinch you can also use a Special Summoned \"Gishki Shadow\" or \"Vision\" as the entire Tribute for a Ritual Summon, or utilize the retriever and searcher effect of \"Gishki Abyss\", or \"Gishki Marker\". \nSo far, there are have been a handful of variants of this deck, which duelists can choose from to suit their preferable strategy. Zielgigas Turbo/Beatdown Edit \nThis variant focused on Summoning multiple \" Gishki Zielgigas \" in one turn, often resulting in massive card advantage shift and, in some cases, OTK (courtesy of \" Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max \" and/or managing to summon all 3 Zielgigas, which usually involves activating Salvage to have enough resources). Cards like \" Mound of the Bound Creator \" are usually found within this deck, as primary protection for \"Zielgigas\". This was the fastest variant when Zielgigas was first released but has less control and has become less effective due to power creep. 'Level 8' Gishki's Edit \nThis variant utilizes \" Evigishki Levianima \" as its main power source, coupled with cards like \" Trade-In \" to speed up the deck. A copy of \" Evigishki Soul Ogre \" can also be utilized as both a problem-solving card and as Ritual fodders for \"Levianima\". Apart from the extra draw power there is very little reason to play the level 8 Evigishki's compared to running Zielgigas Turbo, which essentially made the inclusion of Evigishki Levianaima and \"Soul Ogre\" obsolete by prodiving the same utility of each but in a better form with higher atk power and all a single monster card. The only other redeeming quality of level 8 is the potential for using Moulinglacia, the Elemental Lord and Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju as both tech and potential Ritual material. Hieratic Gishki Edit \nThis variant utilizes the ability of \" Evigishki Gustkraken \", coupled with Hieratic monsters like \" Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit \" and \" Hieratic Dragon of Su \" to create a loop similar to Wind-Up Hunter discard loop, forcing opponent to play with less cards in their hand. This deck can also utilize several Rank 6 Xyz Monsters such as \" Gauntlet Launcher \" and \" Constellar Ptolemy M7 \" to eliminate problematic monsters. \nThis variant's power has been somewhat diminished since the Limitation of \" Evigishki Gustkraken \", and to some lesser extent, \" Evigishki Mind Augus \" as well. Gishki FTK Edit \nIn 2013, a Deck out strategy utilizing the \"Gishki\" engine along with a massive Spell lineup received prominent attention. This deck was termed \"Gishkill.\" It created problems in Organized Play because its play sequences during the first turn could take over 40 minutes, which is the the standard allotted time for an official tournament match. Gishkill's notoriety led to \" Evigishki Mind Augus \" being limited by the September 2013 Lists (TCG) . Although a version of \"Gishkill\" was still usable after this, the limitation effectively eliminated the playerbase's interest in the deck.
