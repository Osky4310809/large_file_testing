(Provided by Andy Rexford) \nFour years ago, Andy Rexford sat in his dorm room at Saginaw Valley State University in Michigan and created @ColIegeStudent . Now, with over a million followers and thousands of hilarious tweets, it’s rare that you can take a scroll down your timeline without seeing a @CollegeStudent tweet. Whether talking about the realities of finals week or the necessity of a good ole’ Netflix binge, there’s nothing more relatable. \"Attendance is not mandatory\" pic.twitter.com/7hYLfFer1d \n— College Student (@ColIegeStudent) January 11, 2017 \nWhen Rexford was a freshman at SVSU, he was a typical college student, enjoying college life and all that came with it. But he felt like something was missing. \n“I saw that there weren’t any popular places to look at funny and relatable things for college, so I created one,” Rexford told USA TODAY College. \"Your homework is worth 5% of your grade\"… Nice, no homework. \n— College Student (@ColIegeStudent) February 19, 2013 \n“I tweeted funny memes and it blew up overnight — and from there, it took off.” \nOvernight, Rexford’s account gained 16,000 followers. A month later, it was at 50,000. Four years later, the account has hit one million. As you can imagine, it’s a lot to keep up with. me: has 3 essays to write \nbuzzfeed: we can tell how lonely you are by your choice in bread \n— College Student (@ColIegeStudent) December 15, 2016 \n“I’m always using my phone,” he said. “I’m always either on Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Reddit or Yik Yak. At nighttime I’ll kind of go over popular stuff for the day, see if there’s any new trends, and schedule posts after that.” Sorority girls pose exactly like meerkats in pictures pic.twitter.com/3kzfEdro90 \n— College Student (@ColIegeStudent) January 14, 2017 \nAll of those data overages have worked out in his favor. Rexford, who worked as a dishwasher before he started the account, ended up generating enough income to get himself through college by managing it.

Currently, several college students help to run the account to keep it fresh and updated. \n“Everyone can see themselves in the account. It is them. They can relate to it,” said Rexford. “It’s a day in the life of the average college student.” \n— College Student (@ColIegeStudent) January 23, 2017 Susannah Hutcheson is a Texas A&M student and a USA TODAY College digital producer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T20:38:48.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
