Inspiration for the perfect name can come from anywhere: a family name, one from a baby name book, or from one of your favorite television shows . It turns out that the name of one of Benedict Cumberbatch’s most famous roles can even serve as inspiration. \nSpecifically, Nameberry found that Sherlock is the nineteenth most popular name of 2017. That’s right, people are naming their baby boys after the U.K.’s most revered fictional private detective . \nWhile we’re not sure Cumberbatch’s Sherlock would see the honor in having (potentially) thousands of babies named after him, we think it’s a lovely homage to the great character. \n\nWhile Cumberbatch is the current face of the beloved detective on the BBC series Sherlock , Sherlock Holmes has been around long before the Doctor Strange actor took on the role. The character has been around in various imitations since 1887, when his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, began publishing short stories about the detective and his companion in The Strand Magazine . \n\nSince Doyle created him and wrote fifty-six short stories and four novels about his adventures, Sherlock has appeared in various film and TV variations. As the character is 130 years old, it’s safe to say that he’s inspired many generations and while we’re sure there have been babies named after him before, there’s a certain attitude that Cumberbatch brings to the role that really makes him shine. \n\nWho knows, in twenty years, we may have hundreds of Sherlock’s running around London, solving crimes. \nUnfortunately, Watson didn’t make the cut, but there’s always hope for next year! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:18:19.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
