Although the 360-degree video embedded here would be enough to satisfy most people’s curiosity, this team wanted more data! \nSpaceshark’s group proceeded to create a data logger using an Arduino Uno , along with sensors to collect data on the satellite’s latitude and longitude coordinates. Altitude, wind speeds, time, and the satellites in view can also be recorded, saving readings on a microSD card for later analysis. \nSince these type of balloons can reach heights of 100,000 feet, the fact that the boards used could get quite cold, as well as the question of whether or not the GPS used would work at that altitude, had to be considered. You can find more details of this build on its Instructables page here.
