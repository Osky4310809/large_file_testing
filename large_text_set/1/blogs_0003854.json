The report shows how the hack was carried out and how the documents were handed to WikiLeaks for dissemination. \"Moscow's influence campaign,\" as the intelligence report calls it, blended a variety of means, including covert cyberactivity by Russian intelligence operatives, along with \"with overt state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or 'trolls'.\" And there was Trump himself, who peddled the material to his followers, making it sound as if the hacks contained truly explosive information. All those Clinton emails, in fact, were the least of it. Few people read them, but many people believed the claim that they contained great and horrifying secrets. The greater effort was in painting Clinton as unfit to lead. Putin, as we wrote months ago and as US intelligence experts concluded, \"developed a clear preference\" for Trump over Clinton. When he thought Clinton would win despite Russia's multipronged effort to cast doubt on her, the plan shifted to undercutting the credibility of the election. The report says pro-Russian government bloggers were all set to launch a #DemocracyRIP campaign after a Clinton win, to undercut the election's credibility. Curiously, Trump had also strongly suggested that if he lost it would be because of fraud.
