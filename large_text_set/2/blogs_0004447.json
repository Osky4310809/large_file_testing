Landing on a platform above the Texas audience, she launched into a mix of \"Just Dance,\" \"Edge of Glory\" and \"Poker Face\" surrounded by backup dancers dressed in futuristic garb with the star in a coordinating metallic bodysuit and boots. \nAs fire exploded around her, the songstress continued into her career hit, \"Poker Face,\" as she flipped through the air on strings and landed just in time to transition into \"Born This Way.\" Judging from the routine thus far, Gaga was certainly born to do this.

Instead, the stage was all for Gaga as she switched into \"Just Dance\" while accompanying herself on a keytar. \nBefore the grand finale, Lady Gaga slowed it down for an intimate moment with fans all around the world as she took a seat at a piano to perform her most recent hit, \"Million Reasons.\" In between chords, she gave shoutouts to her mom and dad in the audience—a moment that surely had everyone watching a bit teary-eyed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:06:08.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
