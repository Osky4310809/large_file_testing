Um, hello, it’s the H onest Trailer for the 2017 Oscar-nominated films . While we all love watching the year’s major motion pictures and going to viewing parties and acting like we have legitimate critical opinions about them so that we can justify our champagne and fancy dress, Honest Trailers really hit the spot because they kind of say what we’re all thinking. While we LOVE many of these movies, there are also times when you watch something and are kinda like, “um, okay?” Honest Trailers are brilliant because they’re ~comedy~, so it’s acceptable to talk about things like…\nHow Amy Adams seems to really love movies about “trying to relate to an alien no one gets along with”… www.youtube.com Or how we all have a few movies we know we’d love if we ever got around to watching them… www.youtube.com Or the movies that are totally enjoyable, but you’re shocked to see them nominated, because there’s, like, nothing ~highbrow~ and pretentious about them. www.youtube.com Whatever your feelings about the Oscar-nominated movies this year, there’s definitely something in this Honest Trailer for you. Check out the full video below!\nWe’ll just be over here, crossing our fingers that the actual award show is this entertaining.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:50:35.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
