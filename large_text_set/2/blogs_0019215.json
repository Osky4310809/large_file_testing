LOUIS • The American Civil Liberties Union sued St. Louis County police in federal court Tuesday, claiming that police searched a home without a warrant while pursuing a man who didn’t pay a $55 cab fare. \nPolice were called to unincorporated St. Louis County on July 10 by a cabdriver who said that someone took a cab from downtown St. Louis at 3 a.m., then disappeared after saying he would return with the money. \nJon Luer and Andrea Steinebach were asleep when officers entered their house through an unlocked door and began pounding on a door in their basement, the suit says. Luer left their bedroom wearing only his underwear and was alarmed to find two officers with guns drawn in the hallway, the suit says. \nThe officers ordered the couple to wake up their son, and then took him to the taxi, where the driver misidentified him as his fare, the lawsuit claims. \nThe driver said that his passenger was drunk and wearing a white hat, but police could not find the hat in a search of the son’s room, and the son passed a sobriety test, the suit says. They left after figuring out that the son was not the man they sought, the suit says, and never filed an incident report. \nThe suit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. \n“The illegal actions of these officers violated the rights of this family,” said Tony Rothert, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri, in a statement. \n“The armed invasion into their home by government officers was unconstitutional and the police department must take action to ensure that this does not ever happen again.” \nPolice declined to comment. By Robert Patrick St. Louis Post-Dispatch Feb 21, 2017 ( … ) \nAn ACLU lawsuit, filed Tuesday, that claims St. Louis County police searched a couple's home without a warrant.
