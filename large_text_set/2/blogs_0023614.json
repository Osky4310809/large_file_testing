Andy Harris to hold a town hall meeting next month Rep. Andy Harris MATT BUTTON | AEGIS STAFF / Patuxent Homestead \nU.S. Congressman Andy Harris \nU.S. Congressman Andy Harris (MATT BUTTON | AEGIS STAFF / Patuxent Homestead) John Fritze , who has been under pressure from constituents concerned about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, said Thursday he will hold a town hall meeting with voters at the end of March.\nHarris has come under fire from some constitutes for holding tele-town halls instead of an in-person meeting as Republicans across the country have faced pointed questions about the Obamacare repeal at similar gatherings. Earlier this month, Harris said he would hold an in-person meeting once Republicans unveiled a replacement plan. \nIn a statement Thursday, Harris said he plans to hold a \"brick-and-mortar\" town hall in Easton on March 31 because, he said, a replacement \"should be available by the end of March.\" Republican leaders have presented an outline of a plan, but it's not clear they are close to a bill that it could pass their chamber, let alone the Senate. \nFormer House Speaker John Boehner on Thursday predicted a full repeal of Obamacare wouldn't happen, calling it \"happy talk.\" \nHarris' announcement said the time and location of the in-person meeting had not yet been set. \nHarris, who repeatedly discussed his opposition to the health care law in four elections in the heavily-Republican 1st Congressional District. also announced two more tele-town halls. The first will take place on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and a second will occur Tuesday before President Trump addresses a joint session of Congress.

The letter suggests Trump’s “grave emotional instability… makes him incapable of serving safely as president.” (Feb. 21, 2017) \nThe announcement did not provide dial-in information for those meetings. \n\"It's important to me that we have the proposed plan details in hand to share with attendees of the brick-and-mortar town hall so that I can answer their specific questions at the town hall, rather than offer only speculation, which is all we have at this time,” Harris said in a statement. \nThe announcement Thursday came days after more than 200 people attended a town hall-style meeting at Harford Community College to discuss the health law. That meeting was organized Citizens for Health Care, a Harford County group that has been pressuring Harris for a meeting. \nHarris, an anesthesiologist, has frequently hosted both tele-town halls and in-person meetings since his first year in Congress. Aides said he has held more than 60 brick-and-mortar town halls and dozens of tele-town halls since 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:51:03.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
