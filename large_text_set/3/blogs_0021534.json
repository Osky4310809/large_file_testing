Mr Spicer has continued to defend the claims. \nThe Times story also claimed “the President insists on dealing with crises by creating new ones” – much to the irritation of his staff, who reportedly “often feel like human shields”. \nThe claims were attributed to a number of anonymous and on-the-record sources. \nThe article's writer, Glenn Thrush, tweeted a link to the story, along with the message: “Even Spicer has had it with Trump's tweets.” Just when you thought @nytimes couldn't go lower, they make up this. https://t.co/XRKe0BOknU — Sean Spicer (@PressSec) March 21, 2017 \nThe piece included a denial from the press secretary about Mr Trump's tweets making his job harder. He told the newspaper: \"It's just not true.\" \nBut after it was published, Mr Spicer took to Twitter himself. \n“Just when you thought The New York Times couldn't go lower, they make up this,” he wrote. \nThe President's administration has persistently feuded with the media, and Mr Trump likes to describe that newspaper as, \"failing\". Sean Spicer gets called out by reporters for his USA flag pin being upside down \nHe has also singled out The Washington Post and broadcasters, CNN and NBC News for criticism. \nTowing his leader's line, Mr Spicer has also criticised news outlets for some of their coverage, at one point offering to help write headlines on the Times’. \n“I think your headlines are bad,\" Mr Spicer told one of its journalists. \n\"I'd be glad to rewrite if you're looking for some help. Our services are at the The New York Times' disposal if it comes to writing headlines. And we can probably do a couple of things on stories , too, if you're willing to go there.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:59:28.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
