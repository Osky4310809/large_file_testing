The few who stayed were subjected to temperatures of minus 9 degrees Fahrenheit. \nNow that protesters have left the camp, the Standing Rock website says that the Tribe will challenge the easement in court on the grounds that the EIS was “ wrongfully terminated .” \n“ The Obama administration correctly found that the Tribe’s treaty rights needed to be acknowledged and protected, and that the easement should not be granted without further review and consideration of alternative crossing locations, ” Jan Hasselman, lead attorney for the Tribe, said in a statement . \n“ Trump’s reversal of that decision continues a historic pattern of broken promises to Indian Tribes and unlawful violation of Treaty rights. They will be held accountable in court. ” \nOn Tuesday, the Indigenous Coalition at Standing Rock called for an “ international day of emergency actions ” to take place on February 8, “ to disrupt business as usual and unleash a global intersectional resistance to fossil fuels and fascism .” \"We haven't lost\" - #NoDAPL speaker at the White House after Army Corp says it will grant easement to finish construction at #StandingRock pic.twitter.com/M77zvDc3qL — Alexander Rubinstein (@AlexR_DC) February 8, 2017 \nOn Wednesday, protesters took to the streets in several cities across the US, as a part of what is being called the “ last stand ” rallies.
