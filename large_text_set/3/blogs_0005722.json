I think we can forget it,\" said the former unified super-middleweight champ. \n\"It was a fantastic fight, it really was and although it could be the end of him, you've got to give David Haye credit, because that was clearly a debilitating injury.\" \nHaye, 36, who fought half the contest on one leg, insists he can recover from the injury and the second stoppage of his career to face Bellew again. \n\"I would love to do it again, I have never been in a fight like that,\" said Haye. \"If the fans want to see it again I would do it again. We'll do it on his terms, in his town - he deserves it. \n\"I'll get healthy and then, if we would oblige me, we can do it again.\" \nHaye, who rushed to Munich to see specialist sports doctor Hans Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt before the fight, bravely battled on, throwing hopeful hooks - some of which caught the Bomber, who seemed to gas in the second half of the fight. \nHe was then battered through the ropes in the 11th round and despite rising to his feet, trainer Shane McGuigan chucked the towel into the ring with the referee waving the contest off. \nHaye was out of the ring for four years due to a shoulder injury until his comeback last year but now, at 36 years old, faces the toughest battle of his career to return to the ring. \nVictor Bellew revealed after the fight that he also suffered an early injury - when he BROKE his right hand. \nBellew described his damaged hand as being \"the size of a small bowling ball\". \n\"I broke my right hand in the second or third round,\" the 34-year-old told BBC Radio 5 Live. \n\"It is sore now but I don't feel the pain - all I think about is winning.\" poll loading Will Tony Bellew give David Haye a rematch? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:18:58.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
