He joined Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl on Monday.\nOklahoma running back Joe Mixon punched a woman a couple of years ago. He served a one-year suspension that was also a redshirt. He played on Oklahoma’s Playoff team last year and has been a star for this year’s Sugar Bowl team. Video of Mixon’s punch recently became public. Monday’s Sugar Bowl is his first game since then.\nDuring the broadcast of the Sugar Bowl on Monday, ESPN’s Brent Musburger offered extended thoughts on Mixon’s situation. \n“It was troubling, very troubling to see,” Musberger said of Mixon (apparently the videotape, specifically). “We’ve talked to the coaches. They all swear that the young man is doing fine. Like I said, Oklahoma thought he might even transfer, but he sat out the suspension, reinstated, and, folks, he’s just one of the best, and let’s hope, given a second chance by Bob Stoops and Oklahoma, let’s hope that this young man makes the most of his chance and goes on to have a career ...” \nLater, Musburger spoke more about Mixon. \n“You know, Jess, apparently, some people were very upset when I wished this young man well at the next level,” Musberger told broadcast partner Jesse Palmer. “Let me make something perfectly clear. What he did with that young lady was brutal, uncalled for. He’s apologized. He was tearful. He got a second chance. He got a second chance from Bob Stoops. I happen to pull for people with second chances, OK? Let me make it absolutely clear that I hope he has a wonderful career and he teaches people with that brutal, violent video. OK?” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:04:30.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
