The company says it’s looking for startups in areas like like content creation and personalization, virtual reality and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, content distribution, interactive advertising and e-sports. \n“The idea is for Verizon to really get out there and see what’s going on in the market,” said Paul Heitlinger of Verizon Ventures. “What’s really compelling for the companies who participate is, they get to work directly with Verizon’s business units. … They get access to our technologies, our networks, all behind-the-scenes stuff.” \nAt the same time, Heitlinger said participating in the program “doesn’t mean you have to work exclusively with Verizon.” \nAs for whether these startups are then teed up for additional funding from Verizon Ventures, he said, “We wouldn’t say no, we wouldn’t say yes. … If we feel that there’s a particular company that’s well-suited or well-aligned with Verizon’s business, just like any other startup we would invest .” \nVerizon has been trying to move deeper into digital media, with initiatives like its go90 mobile video app , not to mention its acquisition of AOL (which owns TechCrunch) and the still in-progress Yahoo deal . \nThe deadline to apply to the Verizon Media Tech Venture Studio is May 30, with the program starting on July 31.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:12:49.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
