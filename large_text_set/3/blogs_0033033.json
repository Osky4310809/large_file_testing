It can often mean that your moods swing from one extreme to the other – though each mood will last a significant amount of time, ranging from weeks to months on end.\nWith bipolar type 1, I generally experience more extreme manic moods than I do lows, though when I do feel low, I feel on the verge of suicidal.\nThere are many forms of mania, however. I will be very, very irritable and quick to anger. I become very paranoid and over-think everything.\nDespite taking sleeping tablets, I will sleep as little as two hours, often waking around 4am to do something out of my usual character. I will feel invincible and I will act irrationally and compulsively, loving every second of that surge of adrenaline that comes with it. And I’ll soon regret it when the mania wears off.\nFor example, I’m a natural blonde but 5 years ago I dyed my hair brown, and have kept it that way (bar the occasional other dark colours such as black or deep red) ever since.\n(Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler) But a year-and-a-half ago, I decided when I woke up that I was going to go back to blonde. I didn’t ‘have time’ (meaning I didn’t want to wait) for an appointment, and so I ran to the shop, grabbed two packets of bleach powders, and re-bleached my hair over and over in one day to go from a dark brown to a white blonde (with some yellow patches, of course).\nI then spent the next few days dying it from silver to lilac, before getting bored and dying another dark colour over it.\nI spent the following year and a half treating it with coconut oil, getting several hair cuts before ultimately cutting it very short and having to grow it out all over again because it was so ruined. Oh, how I kicked myself for ever touching it in the first place.\nAnother time, during a bout of mania which lasted for several months, I got 19 tattoos. I started with just a couple on my arms and my hip, and ended with tattoos covering my legs, my stomach, my back and the back of my neck.\nLuckily, I still love them – but would I have waited a little longer to get them had I not been manic? Certainly.\nThere’s always one other indicator that I’m going into a manic episode – I’ll write a book. During one episode, I woke at 4am to write a book, wrote three chapters and sent it off to several publishers thinking I was going to be the next J.K. Rowling. As you can tell, I’m not.\nBut the depressive times are just as bad as the manic times, and sometimes worse.\nI often end up feeling so low that I have repeated suicidal thoughts day in, day out. I sleep too much as opposed to too little. I become very anxious, I have a constant feeling of guilt in my stomach and I am so very angry.\n(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk) I feel vacant and numb and I struggle to concentrate on anything. The worst part is that I never know when it’s going to end.\nBut bipolar is something I’ve got used to over time. It’s not something I would wish away because for me, these feelings are ‘normal’.\nAlongside this, despite how crazy some of my emotions and outbursts may seem, I would never hide it from anyone – because while my illness does not define me, it helps shape who I am.\nI will never, ever be ashamed of my bipolar diagnosis. Because, quite frankly, it’s out of my hands. I didn’t ask for it, so why should I struggle with it in silence?\nWhen meeting a new person it’s not my first topic of conversation – but when the conversation gets deeper I have never, and will never shy away from it. It’s up to the other person how they want to deal with the information, and that’s totally out of my control.\nI also feel it’s incredibly important to talk about it. So, so many people avoid opening up about their mental health out of fear of judgement or disbelief.\nThey’re scared that they’re going to be told ‘it’s all in your head’ and that it ‘isn’t really there’, followed by suggestions such as ‘you need to take a long walk’ and ‘if you drink more water your head will be clearer’.\nBut just because you can’t see it, doesn’t mean it’s not there. It doesn’t mean it’s any less important than a physical illness and it most certainly doesn’t mean it’s any less real, either.\n(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk) I will continue to talk and write about my experience with bipolar because I want to help those who don’t have the courage to. I want people to find real experiences when searching for advice in Google as opposed to forums disregarding it.\nI want people to see how open I am about it and realise that they can be too.\nBut most importantly, I want people to realise they are not alone – no matter lonely they may feel in their own minds.\nAnd hopefully, alongside people who have already received diagnosis, my experiences will somehow find their way to a person who is currently questioning symptoms, but too scared to go to a doctor for help.\nMore: Health Stop making assumptions about how autistic people look and behave \nResearchers have created a downloadable menstrual cycle on a chip \nAs someone who's chronically ill, here's why I can't stand calling in sick \nI hope someone struggling mentally but too afraid to seek help will realise that there’s nothing shameful in doing so, and that seeking help is the first thing they can do to finding the strength to both understand and accept that they are struggling – before they receive the help and education that they need to start to cope with it.\nI will never, ever be ashamed of my mental illness, no matter how much I struggle, no matter what people think of it – because it is a part of me, and it always will be.\nI just pray that others going through a similar thing will some day realise the same thing.\nMORE: 8 things I wish I’d known before being diagnosed with bipolar disorder \nMORE: Bipolar disorder: What it’s like to be both ‘up’ and ‘down’ at the same time ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:20:31.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
