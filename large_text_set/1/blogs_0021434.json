He was there to inspect preparations for the games and urged relevant departments and local governments to ensure high-quality preparations. Xi told the young children attending the Skiing Winter Camp to study hard and grow up healthy. He encouraged national ski team to train hard to enhance their technical skills and strive to win glory for the country. Xi expects great efforts to be exerted to attract more people to participate in winter sports and promote the nationwide fitness program. The preparations for the 2022 Winter Olympics will be a major task for China in the years to come. The Beijing 2008 Olympic Games has shown the profound and splendid Chinese culture and great achievements China has made since its opening up and reform in late 1970s. The Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games will demonstrate what have been achieved in building an overall well-off society-- the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation. Xi pledged that China will prepare and host the 2022 Games in a green, sharing, open and clean-fingered manner. Xi's remarks would guide the direction for making the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games a remarkable, extraordinary, excellent event. The Chinese President said that China will take the 2022 Olympics as an opportunity to facilitate the nation's competitive sports and mass sports, so as to improve the health of all Chinese people. While the Chinese lunar New Year, the Year of the Rooster is around the corner, the nation remains mobilized for brand new endeavors to make the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games a new name card for Zhangjiakou, and offering a new Olympic story.
