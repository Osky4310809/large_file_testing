ADVERTISEMENT \nAndroid security agent The Major and the team she leads within a counter-terrorist unit find themselves set against an expert hacker who can, it seems, get anywhere and control anything. He’s even got a lead on The Major herself. \nThe film is based on a hugely complex comic book series which spawned any number of TV series and animated movies of its own, including the critically acclaimed 1995 feature length “Ghost in the Shell” from Production IG—high standards, perhaps impossibly high to satisfy franchise fans. \nWho’s in it? \nScarlett Johansson has become the face of “Ghost in the Shell”, playing the role of The Major (or Major Motoko Kusanagi, as she’s known in other mediums). \nAn international cast continues the effort to appeal to an international audience, with Japanese legend Takeshi Kitano leading Section 9, whose membership includes the Singaporean actor Chin Han (“Marco Polo”), Denmark’s Pilou Asbaek (“Game of Thrones”) and Australia’s Lasarus Ratuere; plus Michael Pitt of “Hannibal” and “Boardwalk Empire” as the villain and a new character played by France’s acclaimed Juliette Binoche (“Chocolat”). \nWho’s behind it? \nComing up through commercial directing, Rupert Sanders helmed “Snow White and the Huntsman”, starring Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth, before moving on to “Ghost in the Shell”. \nDuring work on the “Snow White” reimagining, Stewart was actually approached to co-star in another anime adaptation long in the making, “Akira”, which has been in pre-production since 2002. \nThe film itself samples storyline elements from the TV series “Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex” seasons one and two. \nWhen’s it out? \n“Ghost in the Shell” has the week of March 31 as its international launch. \nFrance and Belgium, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines are tracking for March 29, while the United Kingdom and Ireland, Australia, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Hong Kong and Singapore have March 30 as release day. \nThe United States, Canada, Taiwan and South Africa will have March 31, while China and Japan both will have April 7.
