It features various collaborators including John Congleton, Bobby Krlic (also known as the Haxan Cloak) and Leo Abrahams. Alison Goldfrapp said the Silver Eye sessions pushed her and keyboardist Will Gregory into new creative spaces. \"Often we react to things we've just done,\" she said. \"We like the spontaneity of not knowing. It's only through the process that we start to figure out what it is. The fans who have stuck with us are the ones who embrace that idea and are excited by the thought that they don't know quite what to expect next.\" \nGoldfrapp have several international dates scheduled in support of Silver Eye , along with U.S. shows in Philadelphia and a two-night stand in New York April 26th and 27th.
