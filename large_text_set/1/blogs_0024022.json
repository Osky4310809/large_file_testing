It isn't clear if the rumours refer to another future series or they are just unfounded. (Photo: Channel 5) (Photo: Channel 5) \nThe rumour comes as it was revealed Calum Best is one of five housemates who could narrowly miss out on the final. The perma-tanned lothario could leave via the backdoor on tomorrow's show. \nA source who works on the show said: \"This rumour is crazy. We are all finishing on Saturday, the day after the final. Our contracts will be up and so will the contestants.\" \nIt comes as CBB prepare for an old faces task in the final week 0 with Vanessa Feltz making a sensational return. (Photo: Channel 5) \nThe presenter is returning this weekend, and the news was announced by her partner Ben Ofodeu on Facebook in a sweet post of the loved-up couple together as well as on Celebrity Big Brother 's Bit on the Side. \n“This lady goes in to the CBB house this weekend,” he wrote. \n“The wifey that is Vanessa Feltz.” \nVanessa will be joining the house to take part in an eviction task. Vanessa Feltz and her daughter Saskia Kurer (Photo: Rex) Vanessa Feltz in The Big Brother House (Photo: Wenn) \nVanessa, 54, is a CBB legend having starred on many of the show's spin-offs including Big Brother's Big Mouth, Big Brother's Little Brother and Big Brother's Bit on the Side. \nShe also joined the fun for Celebrity Big Brother in 2013, but was booted out just days before the final. \nOn Friday night, Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag were evicted from the CBB house after facing off against just one other housemate. \nSpeidi was the second eviction of the night, having lost out to Kim Woodburn in the voting stakes. \nOpening up to Emma Willis after they exited the house, Spencer explained why they started a lot less drama this time around, claiming it was because they got on with most of their housemates. \n\"We love most of the house this time round. We had run-ins but loved Nic [ Nicola McLean ],\" Heidi said. Spencer and Heidi get booted out (Photo: Channel 5) \nAnd Spencer added: \"We wanted to win until we met James Cosmo – it's like having a unicorn in the house. We tried to play along, play the game, but James C to win.\" \nSpeaking about their old nemesis, Spencer then revealed he'd have loved a certain CBB Bit On The Side presenter to join them in the house. \n\"I wished Rylan had come in, put some heat on them all,\" he joked. Heidi hugs Emma as they make their grand exit (Photo: Channel 5) \nEmma asked them about their interactions with Kim after their explosive arguments - and Speidi both claimed it was all part of Kim's game plan to get loads of attention. \n\"I think Kim's an incredible game-player, as much as I want to be like, 'you're a vile, filthy ratbag', I can't because she loves Big Brother ,\" said Spencer of his foe. \n\"She was all like, 'I can't wait to fight with you guys to get my scene' – she went in on Nic right away, and everyone was like, 'woah', but she played the game.\" Spencer opened up about his strategy in the house (Photo: Channel 5) \nJust an hour previously, their rival Jessica Cunningham had become the seventh housemate to get booted off. \nShe was sent home after fighting for votes against Bianca Gascoigne, Kim Woodburn, Jedward, Jessica Cunningham and the eternally nominated Speidi (Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag). \nThe crowd waiting outside the CBB house had booed most of the housemates when Emma Willis mentioned their names, with particularly loud jeering being reserved for Bianca Gascoigne following the revelation this week that she has a 'secret' boyfriend on the outside.

It's a really great honour,\" Jedward told the Diary Room. \n\"We've been saved because we're a different flavour - we bring blondness, we bring highlights... we bring intelligence.\" \n\"Thanks to the British public, I'm over the moon,\" said Bianca. Emma Willis revealed the voting was very tight for tonight's eviction (Photo: Channel 5) The crowd had booed all the housemates earlier in the show - especially Bianca (Photo: Channel 5) \nAsked by Emma what happened between her and Kim, Jessica said: \"I think she's alright, she went in there with a different persona. I just felt sorry for her as the other housemates didn't gel with her. \n\"She went in with all guns blazing, but none of them have bothered to sit down and have a conversation with her. I think she's isolated herself and she's going to struggle. \n\"If you don't have anyone to talk to and anything to occupy yourself with, the days are really long.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T16:32:12.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
