Capaldi spent two seasons in the TARDIS with Clara, the companion left over from the end of the Smith era.\nBONUS: 2017 Oscar Predictions - CineFix Roundtable", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/DoctorWho?src=hash", "https://t.co/4gx9rTShPZ", "https://twitter.com/bbcdoctorwho/status/826185411823181825", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/pOzTZdnP.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/pOzTZdnP.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-31T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:44:39.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
