Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool captain Jordan Henderson has joined his teammates on a week-long trip to Tenerife as they begin preparations for the Merseyside derby with Everton on April 1st. \nThe Reds boss Jurgen Klopp is making the most of the international break by taking those players not involved with their countries to the Spanish island for a mid-season training camp, reports the Liverpool Echo. \nHenderson has been ruled out of the last four matches with a foot injury he suffered in training prior to the loss against Leicester, but is expected to continue having treatment in a race to be fit for the derby clash. \nKlopp remains hopeful that the Reds midfielder will prove his fitness in time for the Merseyside derby at Anfield a week on Saturday.

Sturridge hasn’t played since last month’s defeat at Hull having suffered from a virus prior to picking up another knock in training. \nWith a dozen members of the first-team squad currently away with their countries, Klopp has bolstered his ranks with a number of Academy youngsters.
