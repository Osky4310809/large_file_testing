Posted 12 hours ago 2 \nDisturbed guitarist Dan Donegan said the band will not be taking another lengthy break between albums, sharing plans to hit the studio within about 12 months. \nThe musician said during a recent interview in Germany: \"I definitely don't anticipate us taking a long break. But there might be a little bit of time - it won't be nothing like a four-year hiatus. \n\"I think hopefully by at least, if not this year, by early next year, hopefully, we'll be in the studio again.\" \nThe latest Disturbed album, \" Immortalized ,\" saw its release in August 2015 as the band's sixth full-length studio effort. It marked the return of David Draiman and co. to the top, mostly thanks to the success of their \" Sounds of Silence \" cover.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:43:07.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
