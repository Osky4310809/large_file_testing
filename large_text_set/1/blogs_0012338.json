Most Popular By Sammy Nickalls Jan 11, 2017 Sure, salmonella is known as the reason why we're not supposed to eat raw cookie dough, so it doesn't have the most favorable of reputations (on top of causing over a million cases of food poisoning every year)â€”but according to new research, it may very well save your life in the future. Researchers from Duke University made a few tweaks to the genetic makeup of the Salmonella bacteria to make it essentially a weapon against glioblastoma, an extremely aggressive form of cancer from which the mean lifespan after diagnosis is just 15 months. The team took out a crucial amino acid from the bacteria that tumors are packed with, which made the bacteria stick to the tumor like a magnet. When it was injected directly into the tumor, the Salmonella reproduced and produced two compounds that cause the cells to self-destruct in low-oxygen environments like the inside of a tumor. This way, the tumors were destroyed without harming the patient.   Said Ravi Bellamkonda, Vinik Dean of Duke's Pratt School of Engineering and corresponding author of the paper, in a statement: \n\"A major challenge in treating gliomas is that the tumor is dispersed with no clear edge, making them difficult to completely surgically remove. So designing bacteria to actively move and seek out these distributed tumors, and express their anti-tumor proteins only in hypoxic, purine rich tumor regions is exciting. And because their natural toxicity has been deactivated, they don't cause an immunological response. At the doses we used in the experiments, they were naturally cleared once they'd killed the tumors, effectively destroying their own food source.\" Most Popular Of course, this research is still in beginning stages, but science is pretty fucking cool.
