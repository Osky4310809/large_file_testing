One cocained actress was carrying the burden of her non existent stardom.She has fallen flat on her face n how.Guess this is poetic justice. â€” Shekhar Suman (@shekharsuman7) February 27, 2017 \nMost peeps on the microblogging site believed it to be about Kangana Ranaut, and roasted Shekhar for his indecent comment. Kangana's movie, Rangoon , that released last Friday has not performed very well at the box office and Mr. Suman seems to be pretty thrilled about it. @shekharsuman7 Hi sir where do you and your super star son @AdhyayanSsuman keep your National awards ?? â€” ashish agarwal (@ashishagarwal_) February 27, 2017 @shekharsuman7 @AdhyayanSsuman : Sumans desperately seeking publicity through Kangana !! ðŸ˜‚ â€” Gaima Ching (@Gaima_Ching) February 28, 2017 \nWhen Twitter users came to Kangana's support, Shekhar's son Adhyayan Suman came to his father's defence with these, rather sweet comebacks! \nThe tweet was followed by a few more rude and insulting ones.
