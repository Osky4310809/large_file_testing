Listing two demands, the group has not only asked the filmmakers to apologise to the community, but also a written assurance on the issue, a ‘Times Now’ report has said. \nAfter the issue came to light yesterday, several filmmakers have come in support of Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Speaking on the issue, Shyam Benegal has said that any kind of violence should be condemned. People have different kinds of views in the history, therefore law should not be taken into hands by anybody, he added. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nExpressing his disgust on the issue, another filmmaker Vikram Bhatt said that filmmakers and artists are always scared of being attacked, as there is no protection for them.
