Their names are Michael and Sarah Bennett. Michael is a psychiatrist. Sarah is Michael’s daughter and a comedy writer. I had them on the show previously to talk about their book F*ck Feelings . In their latest book, F*ck Love , they focus on the most messed up feeling of all: love . \nDespite the irreverent title of their book, the Bennetts provide surprisingly solid and old-fashioned advice when it comes to establishing long-lasting and fulfilling relationships. They discuss why our emotions can lead us astray in relationships and why men are actually more prone to being bamboozled by romantic feelings than women. They then share both the red flags and the positive qualities you should be on the lookout for in a partner if you want a happy relationship. They also discuss what you should do in a relationship in which you’re not happy and why couple’s therapy is often not very useful. \nThis is a podcast full of laughs, as well as some seriously helpful insights on how to navigate relationships effectively. \nNote: Even though the title of the book contains “F*ck,” there’s no swearing in this episode. \nShow Highlights Why love (and romance) is overrated, and how it leads us astray Why you should follow your brain, not your gut The part that romance does play in a relationship Why the Bennetts’ approach to relationships is actually old fashioned Instead of searching for a soul mate, why you should think of yourself as a “romance recruiter” What to look for in a long-term partner Why you shouldn’t enter into a relationship thinking that you can change people characteristics The “Liz Lemon Dealbreakers” to look for in a relationship How to battle the feel-good chemicals that blind us to bad relationships The importance of having a friend who can tell you the truth about your relationships Attributes that we think make for a good partner, but really don’t How charisma can get in the way of a relationship Why Jane Austen would enjoy F*ck Love\nHow communication in a relationship is actually overrated Does your familial relationship predict anything about your romantic relationships? The potential relational downsides of being physically attractive Why someone who isn’t as physically attractive shouldn’t lose hope about dating and relationships Advice for folks who are already married or in a long-term relationship How to think of your partner’s annoying habits or undesirable characteristics Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast My podcast with Michael about F*ck Feelings Why to Treat Your Relationship Like a Bank Account 14 Red Flags to Look for in a Relationship Marriage as a Master Mind “You complete me!” 6 Tips for Successful and Gentlemanly Online Dating My podcast with Brad Wilcox about the surprising benefits of marriage Study that shows loves blinds us to other problems Study that shows men fall in love faster than women Why Every Man Should Read Jane Austen How to Cut Toxic People Out of Your Life The Power of Marriage Meetings \nJust like their first book, F*ck Feelings , the Bennetts provide solid, down-to-earth insights while making you laugh along the way.
