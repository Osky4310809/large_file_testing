He testified about the Feb. 2, 2012 incident in which he chased Graham, 18, from a nearby bodega into his home. \nHe and a partner broke down the door into the teen's home and found him at the end of a hallway — finally chasing him into a bathroom, where Graham went to flush a small amount of marijuana into the toilet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:19:42.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
