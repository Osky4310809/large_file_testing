The sequins covering the wool dinner jacket and skirt: too flashy. The price: at $4,595 for the skirt and $4,995 for the jacket, too high.\nMandel Ngan / AFP / Getty Images First Lady Melania Trump Some online commenters deemed the entire look inappropriate for Congress.\nOthers, like the actress Alyssa Milano, highlighted the price tag.\nOf course, plenty of Twitter users found the choice to be tasteful and elegant, and defended the first lady.\nBut then there was the issue of the color: black. Why choose black on a night when many Democratic women in Congress had decided to wear white as a show of unity for women’s rights?\nThe effort, led by Rep. Lois Frankel of Florida, the chairwoman of the House Democratic Women’s Working Group, had been communicated to the group on Monday in a letter that called for members to wear white to “stand in solidarity with the women of our nation.”\nWin McNamee / Getty Images First lady Melania Trump in Michael Kors Had Melania Trump been aware of the plan? Was her choice a comment on the matter? After all, as on past occasions, she picked out the dress herself. At least that’s the impression Kors gave in a statement issued Wednesday morning: “Mrs. Trump has been a longtime client at our New York boutique. She has a keen understanding of what works best for her and her lifestyle.”\nThe debate had echoes of the one over the pussy-bow blouse Melania Trump wore in her first appearance after the surfacing of the infamous “Access Hollywood” audio tape in which Donald Trump talked to Billy Bush about groping women. At the time, people wondered whether her choice of the Gucci blouse was a pointed statement or a simple coincidence. And then, of course, there was the white Ralph Lauren jumpsuit she wore on election night, a not-so-subtle echo of one of Hillary Clinton’s signature looks.\nAlex Wong / Getty Images Members of congress wear white to honor the women's suffrage movement and support women's rights On those two occasions, as on Tuesday night, no answer was evident, but calculated or not, the end result served to create something of an us-versus-them message.\nThe president’s daughter Ivanka Trump felt a similar sting of backlash for the red off-the-shoulder dress (reportedly designed by Roland Mouret) that she wore on Tuesday evening, with some saying it was more appropriate for a night out than for a high-profile speech.\nAll the hubbub over the Trumps’ attire almost overshadowed another notable sartorial moment: the almost eerily coordinated outfits worn by Mike Pence and Paul Ryan.\nAndres Caballero-Reynolds / AFP / Getty Images Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner arrive prior to US President Donald Trump's address before joint session of Congress Both the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives wore dark suits with bright blue ties, leading some to compare the two to proud parents beaming at their son.\nMaybe their matching looks (which bracketed the dark suit and blue-and-white tie worn by Donald Trump) were meant to signal cooperation between the White House and Congress. Or maybe their choices were just another example of the politico’s Capitol Hill uniform, just as Melania Trump’s suit was simply an expression of her personal tastes.\nChip Somodevilla / Getty Images U.S. President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of the U.S. Congress as Vice President Mike Pence (L) and House Speaker Rep.
