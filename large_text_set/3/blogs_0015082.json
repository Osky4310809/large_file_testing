Several Filipino fishermen were killed after a group of suspected pirates boarded a fishing boat in southern Philippine waters and strafed the crew, officials said Tuesday. Philippine Coast Guard via AP ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — The US agreed Thursday to extend a $1-million aid grant for a maritime facility to help combat piracy and terrorism in the country's southern backdoor. US Ambassador Sung Kim announced the commitment during a courtesy call and closed-door meeting with Zamboanga City Mayor Ma. Isabelle Climaco-Salazar and security officials. Security was tight during Kim's visit and soldiers and police were visible on almost all blocks of the city's downtown district while armored personnel carriers were also deployed on the streets. Kim declined media interviews but Salazar said the Filipino side asked Ambassador Kim about the extension of the grant that will expire this year. The financial assistance will be used for the establishment of the main headquarters of the Philippine National Police Maritime Group in the city. She also expressed the city government’s gratitude to the US for economic aid and programs to the city. The Armed Forces of the Philippines has intensified security along the border near Tawi-Tawi to address the spate of cross-border kidnappings staged by the Abu Sayyaf group. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, in his visit to Sulu last week, said additional naval assets and drones will be deployed to ensure security in the vast sea lanes that the Abu Sayyaf group exploits in their kidnappings and high-sea attacks. Lorenzana said additional Marine reinforcements and military helicopters will also be deployed to Tawi-Tawi. It was Kim's first visit to Zamboanga and to the southern Philippines, where he also visited US troops stationed inside the Western Mindanao Command headquarters. Capt. Jo-Ann Petinglay, Westmincom spokesperson, confirmed the visit but said there was no meeting with the local military commanders. “He went straight to the US station and met with the US forces,” Petinglay said. More than 100 American soldiers are still based inside the military headquarters to provide technical assistance to their AFP counterparts and to help counter terrorism in the region.
