View gallery \nBurnley were terrific, fought for every ball and it was easy to see why they have already won nine of their 14 games at Turf Moor which is now the fourth best home record in the Premier League. \nIt made for a fantastic first half, Chelsea were sublime for the first 20 minutes and yet after Burnley got to grips with them it was a fascinating and highly entertaining battle. \nChelsea will have few harder games all season as Burnley’s energy and work rate ensured that Conte’s men were rarely given any sort of time or space. \nThey were not at their best by any means but perhaps that is the mark of champions to avoid defeat even when you are below par. Conte's men ground out a point (Photo: Darren Walsh) \nIt would take a real Devon Loch moment from here for Chelsea to blow their lead at the top, even if Manchester City reduce it to eight points by winning at Bournemouth on Monday night. \nAnd it is hard to imagine Chelsea being that fragile because they stood firm when under pressure as it was easy to see why so many clubs have tripped up here this season. \nChelsea actually started brilliantly, Diego Costa and Eden Hazard looked in the mood to tear Burnley apart as the visitors were sharp and deadly on the counter attack. \nIt took them just seven minutes to go ahead, Hazard fed Victor Moses on the right, the Chelsea wing back rode Robbie Brady’s challenge and fed Pedro. Pedro netted the opener (Photo: PA) \nChelsea forward Pedro raced into the box, picked up the ball, immediately despatched a low shot in the opposite direction to leave Burnley keeper Tom Heaton helplessly wrong footed. \nIt looked as if it would be an easy away win, another step on the precession to the Premier League title for Conte’s runaway leaders. \nBut that did not factor in Burnley’s spirit and determination. Joey Barton, football’s infamous arch villain, put himself about in midfield, Ashley Barnes created problems up front and Brady’s class gives them a bit of X Factor. \nChelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic conceded a 24th minute free kick on the edge of his own box and Barton and Brady stood over the set piece 25 yards out.

You might have known those two would have a squabble at some stage.

That was a huge moment in the match. Courtois also made another smart save from Andre Gray two minutes after the restart. \nChelsea had a lot of possession in the second half but they barely tested Burnley keeper Tom Heaton as centre half Michael Keane marshalled the home defence superbly. \nBurnley were definitely worth their point and if they survive it will be the first time they stay up in the top flight since 1976. And that is almost as much an achievement for Burnley boss Sean Dyche as winning the title will be for Conte. poll loading Will anyone catch Chelsea now? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T19:33:19.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
