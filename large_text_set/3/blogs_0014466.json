And now Gary Cahill has proved he's got the character to do the same with Wayne Rooney’s for England. \nGareth Southgate needs a new captain for Wednesday’s daunting friendly away to world champions Germany, and Cahill showed at Stoke on Saturday that he has the personality to wear the Three Lions ' armband. \nA lesser man might have dwelt on giving away the penalty to allow Jonathan Walters to cancel out Willian’s opener. \nNot Cahill. Cahill could have gone into his shell after conceding the penalty... (Photo: Reuters) ...that Walters slotted away shortly before halftime... (Photo: Getty) ...to make it 1-1, which was STILL the score with four minutes left (Photo: Getty) \nSpurred on by what he saw as an injustice, the champions-elect's stand-in skipper led their push for a winner — and scored it himself late on to place another Blue finger or two on the Premier League trophy. \nCahill was pleased to come through Saturday's test of character, and says — with Rooney dropped and both Jordan Henderson and Harry Kane out injured — he would be proud to skipper his country again. \n“Let’s see what the manager decides,” said the 31-year-old defender. “I’m just glad I’m back in the squad and I’m glad I’m going to go and play in a big friendly - I’m suspended for the second game. \n“I’m looking forward to it and what will be, will be. It’s been a privilege for me to do it before and in the future, it would be fantastic if I had the chance to do it again.” The defender has worn the England armband before — like here against Estonia in 2015 (Photo: The FA via Getty) \nCahill deserves to take centre stage for the Three Lions in Dortmund on Wednesday, and his ballsy display at Stoke encapsulated his season. \nThe centre-half knew he would have been criticised for conceding the spot-kick, even though he barely touched Walters’ back with his hands. \n“Playing in my position, to have a penalty like that go against you, you can almost see the headlines - 'Cahill’s dropped one and done whatever...'\" he said. \n“Listen, I’ve felt like this a couple of times this season; people are quick to criticise, and when things are going well, we’re winning games and we’re keeping clean sheet after clean sheet, it’s kind of looked upon as the norm. \n“It’s always the same playing at a big club. I’m not expecting any different. \n\"I was just proud of my character because you keep going. I felt good. You start the season, you take a bit of flak, a bit of stick for a couple of games and then you turn that around. Cahill played the captain's role perfectly by scoring the late winner... (Photo: Getty) ...to temporarily lift Chelsea 13 points clear with 10 games to play... (Photo: Getty) ...then celebrating with a move straight out of club skipper John Terry's playbook (Photo: Getty) \n“I’ve said it time and time again — it’s something I keep working hard at. I’m here and I’ve been fortunate enough to captain a team that is doing tremendously well.” \nCahill admits he went “beserk” when he scored three minutes from full-time — and his wild celebrations were echoed by manager Antonio Conte at the final whistle as he swung from the roof of his dug-out. \nThe Italian also performed a string of fist pumps and ran onto the pitch to hug his players, in a clear sign that he and his players think the title-race they have led for months is now almost won. \n“That was up there for all of us,” said Cahill. “You saw the celebrations — everyone knows what that game meant to win. Antonio Conte wasn't QUITE swinging from the rafters with delight... (Photo: BPI) ...but it would have taken a team of top surgeons to get the smile off his face (Photo: Getty) \n\"The importance of getting three points as opposed to one is huge. Come the end of the season, that could be absolutely massive for us.” \nDiego Costa also passed his test of character, despite being targeted by the Stoke fans and some rough-house tactics from their players. \nThe striker just about managed to keep a cool head after looking like he might lose it when booked in the first half for dissent. \nCahill said: “I remember speaking to him in the first half to tell him just to keep his cool — he was on the edge at times, but that’s the way he plays. \n“They [Stoke] are a physical team and it was important we didn’t get dragged into that kind of battle. Diego managed himself really well up there. Sometimes his reputation goes against him I feel, but he got a few fouls and kept his head.” poll loading Should Cahill captain England against Germany? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:35:37.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
