Nope, Even Though The News Came From The Official Sony Twitter Account [Video] \nAs Britney Spears fans may recall, Spears also appeared on James Corden’s popular Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show in August of last year. During her segment on the show, she joined James Corden in signing three of her songs which included “Oops I Did it Again,”“Womanizer,” and “Toxic”. \nJames Corden started the segment by asking Britney what the song “Oops I Did it Again” meant and she responded by saying she wasn’t sure and “it’s just a song”. James told Britney about how he thinks of the story every time he orders pizza and thinks to himself “Oops I Did it Again”. \nThe entire segment featuring Britney Spears and James Corden can be viewed below. \nPer Radio , Spears appeared to be a great sport during the entire segment as she spent just as much time laughing as she did singing. \nBritney Spears Has Been Trending For Other Reasons Lately Too \nWhile it likely has little to do with the fact that her song “Womanizer” is currently trending, Britney has been a topic of conversation on various media outlets lately because of her hot and heavy relationship with her boyfriend Sam Asghari.

In the video above with James Corden, Spears was not shy about mentioning the fact that she wanted three children (in addition to the two she already has). At the time she was in the segment, however, she was not dating her currently boyfriend Sam. \nConsidering the fact that there’s no recent news regarding Britney’s hit song which is nearly a decade old, chances are “Womanizer” is simply trending because a lot of people are looking to either listen to or download the song. It is possible her old hit song is simply trending because her relationship with her new boyfriend has recently been trending too. \nThe director’s cut of the music video for “Womanizer” by Britney Spears can be viewed below. \nThe music video for “Womanizer” was uploaded to Britney Spears’ official YouTube account in October of 2009. The video has acquired more than 154,000,000 views and over 300,000 thumbs up during that time. \nAre you a fan of Britney Spears? Why do you think “Womanizer” is currently trending on the internet?
