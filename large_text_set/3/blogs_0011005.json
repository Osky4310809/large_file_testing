Beachum announced his decision to join the Jets on the Fox Sports Procast: FOX Sports: PROcast @PROcast J-E-T-S Jets! Jets! Jets! ✈️✈️✈️ This just in! Congrats to @KelvinBeachumJr on signing with @nyjets today. #GangGreen #NFLFreeAgency https://t.co/ErDOpcLexA 3/10/2017, 11:51:28 PM The Jacksonville Jaguars declined a long-term option in Beachum's contract in February. He was scheduled to receive a $5 million bonus on Feb. 15 as part of a five-year, $45 million deal he signed last March, which featured a cap hit that steadily rose to $11 million by 2020, per Spotrac . Beachum told Michael DiRocco of ESPN ahead of the option deadline the team's decision wasn't going to impact his preparations for the 2017 season. \"I've been in this position before. I was in this position in Pittsburgh last year. I don't take anything for granted. There are no guarantees,\" he said. \"I'm going to do what I do, which is train and take care of my body, and make sure I can do everything I can do to put my best foot forward wherever I am next year.\" The 27-year-old SMU product didn't live up to expectations after taking over at the crucial left tackle spot for Jacksonville. Pro Football Focus labeled his play, which included allowing 49 quarterback pressures, as a \"massive disappointment.\" Lingering injuries may have played a role in the drop-off, though. Ryan O'Halloran of the Florida Times-Union noted the lineman, who suffered a torn ACL in 2015, had knee pain during the second half of the season. Dion Caputi of the National Football Post remained optimistic about the tackle if he returned to full strength: Dion Caputi @nfldraftupdate At 27, LT Kelvin Beachum has plenty of football left in him. Came off ACL injury + had other health issues. Just needs a team-friendly deal. 2/16/2017, 4:55:53 AM Pro Football Focus rated Beachum as the No. 67 overall player in the NFL for the 2014 season. So there's certainly reason for optimism despite his lackluster play last year. It comes down to making sure he's back to 100 percent in the health department. All told, it's a nice low-risk, high-reward addition for the Jets. While it's not a guarantee the lineman will return to his previous form, he presents upside at a reduced cost compared to what Jacksonville would have needed to pay to keep him. Look for Beachum to slide in as the Jets' new left tackle in 2017. With the offensive line solidified, the team can turn its focus to finding a starting quarterback.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T05:36:41.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
