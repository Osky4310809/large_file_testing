If you’ve opened up a newspaper, turned on the TV, or logged onto the Internet over the past few months, you’ve likely encountered a discussion about the scourge of “ fake news .” Web sites like InfoWars, which published countless false stories suggesting Hillary Clinton was running a child-sex-slave ring out of a D.C.-area pizzeria—leading one North Carolina man to show up to Comet Ping Pong with a gun to “self-investigate” the situation —would be a good example of the epidemic, and its effects on society. According to hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio, an article by The Wall Street Journal about his company, Bridgewater Associates, is another. The story, written by Rob Copeland and Bradley Hope , reports that software engineers at the hedge fund are working on a project, referred to by Dalio as “The Book of the Future,” that will use technology to “automate most of the firm’s management,” including decisions like when to hire people, when to fire people, and even “whether an employee should make a particular phone call.” Within the piece, Copeland and Hope discussed Bridgewater’s unorthodox office culture, the principles of which are outlined in a series of maxims contained in Dalio’s company handbook cum cult text, Principles : \n“ Help people through the pain that comes with exploring their weaknesses ” . . . and a discussion about hyenas killing wildebeests that serves as an argument for how to deal with people in the workplace: \n“For example, when a pack of hyenas takes down a young wildebeest, is this good or bad? At face value, this seems terrible; the poor wildebeest suffers and dies. Some people might even say that the hyenas are evil. Yet this type of apparently evil behavior exists throughout nature through all species and was created by nature, which is much smarter than I am, so before I jump to pronouncing it evil, I need to try to see if it might be good. When I think about it, like death itself, this behavior is integral to the enormously complex and efficient system that has worked for as long as there has been life. And when I think of the second- and third-order consequences, it becomes obvious that this behavior is good for both the hyenas, who are operating in their self-interest, and in the interests of the greater system, which includes the wildebeest, because killing and eating the wildebeest fosters evolution, i.e., the natural process of improvement.” Because of this, and other unusual aspects of life at Bridgewater—such as reportedly recording meetings and the expectation that employees must “criticize one another continually”— The Wall Street Journal reports that roughly “one-fifth of new hires leave within the first year” and “the pressure is such that those who stay sometimes are seen crying in the bathrooms.” According to Dalio himself , coming to work at Bridgewater is “a little bit like entering the Navy SEALS” and “there’s a period—usually of about 18 months— of ... adaptation to this. And some make it and some don’t make it. And so we call it ’getting to the other side.’” In previous attempts to get outsiders to understand what goes on inside the firm, Bridgewater has produced testimonials starring employees who, like one named John, look into the camera and explain how Dalio’s unconventional methods yielded remarkable psychological breakthroughs. At first, John says, he resisted Dalio’s criticism that he had “a reliability problem,” but later realized he was being “illogical” by not asking why he was perceived that way. “I was closing myself off to the notion of exploring that, and reflecting on past experiences. I started to come to a realization that not only has being reliable been a problem for me professionally but personally, all the way back to the time that I was eight years old .” Most recently, Bridgewater put out another series of videos noting that joining the firm will mean that “at some point you’re going to be faced with something really painful and uncomfortable here and it’s up to you to decide if you want that experience.” According co-chief investment officer Greg Jensen , the point of the videos was to give people “a window into what it’s like to be here, to scare you away if you’re not the right kind of person or to potentially attract you if these ideas, if this way of being is attractive to you.” Yet, despite pointing out themselves that Bridgewater is far from your typical company and clearly not for everyone, Dalio bristles at the idea that people might find aspects of life at the world’s largest hedge fund worth criticizing. Which is why, following the publication of Copeland and Hope’s article, Dalio proceeded to publish a 2,685-word response on LinkedIn, entitled “ The Fake and Distorted News Epidemic and Bridgewater’s Recent Experience With The Wall Street Journal .” Although he professes to have “mixed feelings about describing our most recent experience with The Wall Street Journal because many people might misconstrue my doing this as me simply complaining about an article that I didn’t like,” Dalio says he has been “reflecting for quite a while on the destructive effects that fake and distorted media are having on our society’s well-being.” One of Dalio’s biggest gripes is that the authors of the piece ”paint[ed] a one-sided negative picture of the work environment.” According to Dalio, that happened in part because “people who are happy with their experience and respecting our rules are not allowed to speak with the media so you end up hearing disproportionately from disgruntled people.” He says that Copeland did not take Bridgewater “up on [its] offer” to talk to “an extensive list of employees and former employees”—hand selected by the firm—”who could speak freely with him.” Dalio was also disappointed that Copeland and Hope only mentioned the (true) statistics about the high attrition rate of employees in their first and second years at the firm, while leaving out the “exceptionally low“ turnover rates of “those in years three, four, and five.” Dalio further took issue with the fact that Copeland called him out on espousing a culture of “radical transparency” while coming up with a new principle that states, “Expect those who receive the radical transparency to handle it responsibly and don’t give it to them if they can’t.” And that the writer didn’t just say, “Oh, O.K., that makes sense” when Dalio et al came back with some kind of baffling logic for how their process works. \nWhen Copeland asked about how radical transparency works, he suggested that we were disingenuous because we didn’t pursue it totally. We explained our approach: “Don’t get me wrong: radical transparency isn’t the same as total transparency. It just means much more transparency than is typical. We do keep some things confidential, such as illnesses or deeply personal problems, sensitive details about intellectual property or security issues, the timing of a major trade, and at least for the short term, matters that are likely to be distorted, sensationalized, and harmfully misunderstood if leaked to the press.” And we pointed him to the relevant principles. Copeland and Hope chose to ignore those explanations and write “he decided to let only 10 percent have the full measure of what he calls radical transparency.” After he passed that by us, we replied that “It is incorrect that only 10 percent get radical transparency. Here’s the fact. Everyone can see most everything, but only the top 150 or so people get to see the most sensitive type of stuff which, in most companies would be limited to only the top 5 or 10 people.” The authors chose to go with their mischaracterizations, even though doing so was misleading. In addition to not liking how building ”The Book of the Future” came across in print, Dalio says that Copeland and Hope “mischaracterized several other things . . . [but] I won’t delve into more examples because we are past the point of diminishing returns.” All you need to know is that there are ”systemic risks arising from fake and distorted media” and that those risks include coming away from a piece describing a hedge fund that, by all accounts, sounds pretty fucking strange and thinking, “That place sounds pretty fucking strange.” For more examples of untrustworthy news sources, in Dalio’s opinion, refer to his essay entitled “ The New York Times Story Is a Distortion of Reality ,” which incidentally came out just after the Gray Lady published a story about a Bridgewater employee who claimed his superior sexually harassed him and was subsequently pressured by top managers “to rescind his claims.” Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T02:56:04.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
