The midfield player is currently undergoing rehab and an individual training programme. \n\"The long term target for the player is to be fully fit and ready to play for the start of next season \nDortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke added: \"BVB wishes Mario Götze a fast recovery, also in the name of their ten million fans.\" \nGotze is now back in Bavaria, where he is surrounded by his family as he continues working on his recovery. Gotze’s brother, Felix, played for Bayern’s Under-19 side, while his father, Jurgen, and older brother Fabian, both also live there. \nThe 62-cap star has also been to visit Dr Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, whom he knows well from his time at Bayern.

That has led to repetitive muscle injuries, which have unfortunately been a regular occurrence during his career. \nAs such, a big part of his rehab has been changes to his diet. Gotze has recently been seen frequenting the Brenner Grill in Munich’s Maximilianstraße, with super foods like quinoa, avocado and hemp seeds an increasingly key component in Gotze's diet, with they and similar foods a key aid in Gotze’s recovery. \nBVB hope to have the player ready for their pre-season tour of China in the International Champions Cup. \nDespite the club's continued participation in the Champions League and their battle to finish in the Bundesliga top four, they have no intention of looking to rush Gotze until he is fully fit and ready. \nThey are optimistic that now they have got to the base of the player's problems, Gotze will eventually be back to something like his best. poll loading Will Mario Gotze be a success back at Borussia Dortmund? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T16:54:31.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
