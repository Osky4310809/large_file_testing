Our dream is to make history on a team, both of us together. And why couldn't that be in Mexico?\" \nZizinho, the father of Jonathan and Giovani, played professionally for a host of Mexican clubs in the 1980s, including Club America. Jonathan noted that he has always had an appreciation for the Mexico City outfit, and one of its legendary players. \n\"Cuauhtemoc Blanco was one of the players I followed the most,\" Jonathan said. \"He was playing for the team I liked the most then and he's always been a reference.\" \nJonathan, 26, has been playing regularly with Villarreal of late. The midfielder has made 25 appearances for the Yellow Submarine across all competitions this season.
