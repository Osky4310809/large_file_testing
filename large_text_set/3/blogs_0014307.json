The PlayStation 4 exclusive, developed by Guerrilla, was released globally February 28 to widespread critical acclaim. The impressive launch makes Horizon Zero Dawn the best-selling new first party IP launch on the PS4 system to date and Guerrilla’s biggest debut ever. \n“We knew Horizon Zero Dawn was going to be something special, so to see the incredible critical reaction to a brand new game world translate into this level of sales is really gratifying,” said Shawn Layden, Chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios. “Guerrilla has created a game that is nothing short of exceptional, and the reaction we have seen from fans – from hours and hours of gameplay streaming to endless photo sharing – shows just how impactful it has been.” \n“We’re thrilled that Horizon Zero Dawn has been embraced by critics and players alike. Developing the game was a labor of love, so it’s extremely satisfying to see that it elicits the same passion and enthusiasm from the gaming public that we felt during its development,” said Guerrilla Managing Director Hermen Hulst. \nHulst teased that even more Horizon Zero Dawn was on the way, though if it is story DLC or a sequel remains to be seen. \n“This is only the beginning of Aloy’s story and our exploration of the world of Horizon Zero Dawn, with the team already hard at work on an expansion to the story.” \nHorizon Zero Dwan follows Aloy of the Nora tribe that has been massacred by an unknown group of masked people. Aloy defies her tribe’s advice about praying to the Goddess for help, and decides to find out what’s going on by herself. She leaves her sacred lands and heads to Meridian to solve the mystery. The enemy leader is raising up ancient machines to take back what he believes to be his, by taking control of the machines that roam the land. He’s also creating something larger that threatens everyone’s existence. The game explores the juxtaposition of a primitive world of hunters and advanced technology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T17:46:37.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
