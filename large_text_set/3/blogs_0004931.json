OnePlus 3 update: OxygenOS 3.2.4 \nThe OnePlus 3 has received a troublesome new update, with OxygenOS 3.2.4 recently being pushed out to handsets. The 26 MB hotfix patch that rolled out has caused more problems than expected, with reports that it has fixed some issues while also creating new ones. Firstly, the good news. The update includes a fix for the auto-reboot issue which previously affected some devices, along with improved call quality. There are also other minor optimizations. \nNow onto the bad news. Shortly after the update was released, reports of the hotfix breaking things began to appear. Some OnePlus 3 owners said that Android Pay no longer worked, and others that the phone was unable to maintain a proper LTE connection, instead dropping down to 3G or even 2G speeds. A thread has been opened in the OnePlus forum to deal with these bugs, so head there if you'd like more information about what to do. \nIt's certain that OnePlus is working on fixes for these issues. As soon as we know more about it, we'll update this article with the details. We've got the latest OnePlus 3 update news. / © AndroidPIT OnePlus 3 update: OxygenOS 3.2.2 \nOnePlus seems to be paying special attention to its new flagship, with a second update to the firmware being released within a month of the first. This new update is slimmer than the last and offers a few improvements and bug fixes. \nAs detailed on the OnePlus forums , the update improves notification management in Doze, addresses an issue with the alert slider, and disables the fingerprint scanner when the device is in your pocket, along with a few other things. \nAs always, the roll out is incremental, so don't worry if you haven't received the new version yet: it is on its way. OnePlus 3 update: OxygenOS 3.2.1 \nLess than a month after launching, OnePlus released the first update to the OnePlus 3 firmware. The phone left the factory with the company's own OxygenOS 3.1.1 on board, but the software was updated to version 3.2.1 through a download weighing 396 MB. \nThe latest version of the OS fixes an issue related to rather aggressive RAM management. Although the OnePlus 3 packs 6 GB of RAM into its slender frame, the device only actually makes use of 4 GB. Whether the update addresses this is yet to be seen, but, at the very least, it should manage the 4 GB it uses with a more delicate touch once updated. The updating coming in OTA to a user on the OnePlus forums. / © werksmannschaft \nElsewhere, there's a new sRGB mode, which should improve the display quality, but it has to be enabled through the Developer options. \nThe update is also said to contain improvements to the device's GPS performance, updated custom icon packs, and fixes for issues with notifications. \nHave you received the OxygenOS update on your OnePlus 3? let us know in the comments. \nWith prior contributions from Chris Marshall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:23:07.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
