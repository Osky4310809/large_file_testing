The scene depicts when Anheuser-Busch co-founder Adolphus Busch, right, after traveling by boat from Germany, met fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. (Budweiser via AP)   \nIt didn't make quite as much of an upset as the Patriots did in the last quarter of last night's game, but Budweiser's Super Bowl immigration ad is still managing to keep people talking on Twitter Monday morning. \nThe ad told the story of Adolphus Busch â€“ the co-founder of Budweiser's parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev â€“ and his immigration to the U.S. from Germany in the 1800s. The ad, in the works since May , comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nThe fate of the immigration ban is unclear following one federal judge's decision halting it. Budweiser is going to run a Super Bowl ad showing its founder was an immigrant, but that made some people want to #BoycottBudweiser . ðŸ™„ pic.twitter.com/B8LPcL70Sm â€” AJ+ (@ajplus) February 5, 2017 \nPeople unhappy with the ad used the hashtag #boycottbudwiser -- in which the name of the brewery is misspelled -- on Twitter to voice their frustrations even before the Super Bowl, though others used the hashtag mock the boycott. The hashtag had generated nearly 21,500 tweets by late Monday morning. \nSocial media is a popular route for consumers to take when looking to round up like-minded boycotters, with campaigns like #GrabYourWallet advocating the boycott of Trump-associated companies and #BoycottStarbucks in retaliation to the company's plan to hire 10,000 refugees over five years. I will also #boycottbudwiser for their stupid Super Bowl commercial which is definitely #antitrump propoganda this is getting ridiculous", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:48:48.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
