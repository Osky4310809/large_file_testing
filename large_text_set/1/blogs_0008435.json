David Bowie: 1947 - 2016 David Bowie died today after an 18 month battle with cancer 1 / 37 WireImage Bowie tribute at the Brit Awards 2016 \nAlthough best known for his unparalleled back catalogue of hits, David made a huge mark on fashion thanks to his ever changing personas. \nFrom Ziggy Stardust to The Thin White Duke, David switched up his alter egos with completely different styles. \nHis fashion legacy was so great that the V&A in London dedicated a retrospective exhibition to his career, with his most recognisable costumes on display. \nGETTY TRADEMARK: Kate wore the Yamamoto playsuit at the BRITs \nZiggy Stardust was probably David's most eccentric character (a bisexual alien rock star) and has countless iconic looks to choose from. \nOne of his playsuits, designed by Kansai Yamamoto, was so recognisable that Kate Moss wore it to accept David's Best Male Solo Artist award at the 2014 BRIT Awards. \nThe tiny red romper featured white and black designs, and was the perfect accompaniment to Ziggy's feathered red hair. \nGETTY ALIEN: Ziggy is David's most iconic character \nZiggy also toyed with the pirate aesthetic for a while after David got conjunctivitis, wore an eye patch and decided that it totally worked. \nTeaming his patch with red dungarees, a tied up shirt and a neckerchief, this look was a perfect example of Bowie's quirky androgyny. \nThe Thin White Duke was another one of David's characters who was cooked up after he retired Ziggy in 1973. \nGETTY CONTROVERSIAL: David called the Thin White Duke an 'ogre' after retiring him \nCharacterised by a white shirt, a waistcoat and slicked back hair, The Thin White Duke was associated with the Station to Station album. \nHe turned out to be the most controversial of all of David's personas due to an apparent positivity towards fascist views. \nDespite the achingly cool style of the Duke, David phased him out due to his soaring cocaine use. \nGETTY SUITED AND BOOTED: David turned to 80s tailoring for the Serious Moonlight tour \nSuits played a big part in the Serious Moonlight tour following David's success with Let's Dance. \nThe suits worn by David and his band were meant to be a slight parody of the popular New Romantics of the 80s, but David managed to make them his own – despite having just one costume stage during the show. \nOur favourite was this slouchy, over-the-top, powder blue number, which could be the only time a fedora has looked cool. \nPR MAGIC DANCE: 80s kids first met Bowie in Labyrinth Related videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T10:41:26.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
