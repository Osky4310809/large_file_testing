'Proper get-together' \nMs Smith said the independence movement \"needs to start chatting again\". \nShe said: \"To win another independence referendum, we'll need everyone to come together and bring their own skills and knowledge. \n\"There's lots to get done and 2017 is going to be a very important year. So it should begin with a proper get-together of everyone in the independence movement to plan a way forward.\" Image copyright Scottish Independence Convention / twitter Image caption The SIC held a \"reassembly\" on the second anniversary of the 2014 vote \nSNP MP Tommy Sheppard added: \"Everyone needs to look with fresh eyes and open minds about what options are now available to us to build a better Scotland. \n\"We can never have too many ideas and I hope this conference will focus minds on practical strategies for the year ahead.\" \nThere will also be discussion of the independence white paper project set up by think tank Common Weal. \nThe first draft of the paper drawn up by the group charts the possible process of independence, including proposals for a new Scottish currency and a referendum on a written constitution and EU membership as part of a three-year transition. 'Not bluffing' \nIt also includes \"very rough\" estimates of the economics of an independent Scotland, suggesting that there would be an £18.8bn one-off cost of setting up the institutions of a new state and that the country would run an £8.8bn deficit in its first year. \nNicola Sturgeon has commissioned research of her own via a national survey and a \"growth commission\" headed by former MSP Andrew Wilson. \nShe has ruled out holding a referendum in 2017, but has insisted she is \"not bluffing\" about holding one over Brexit. Her predecessor Alex Salmond has predicted a referendum in Autumn 2018 . \nThe Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems all oppose independence, and want a second referendum taken off the table altogether. \nScottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson has accused Ms Sturgeon of \"leaving Scotland in limbo\", saying she should \"ditch her draft referendum bill \" and \"move on from constitutional navel-gazing\". \nAnd Labour's Kezia Dugdale backs a federal UK with a \"new Act of Union\" to \"safeguard our family of nations for generations to come\".
