In a bid to bolster its presence, China has transformed seven reefs and islets through reclamation into artificial islands. The mini fortresses now host anti-aircraft guns and other weaponry, according to recent analysis.\nAlthough a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to answer a journalist’s question about possible responses to American naval incursions into the vital trade corridor, China’s notoriously strident state media pulled no punches.\n“Tillerson’s statements regarding the islands in the South China Sea are far from professional,” the Chinese Communist Party-linked Global Times declared in an editorial on Friday. “If Trump’s diplomatic team shapes future Sino-U.S. ties as it is doing now, the two sides had better prepare for a military clash.”\nThe state-backed China Daily described Tillerson’s remarks as “a mish-mash of naivety, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices, and unrealistic political fantasies. Should he act on them in the real world, it would be disastrous [and] set a course for devastating confrontation between China and the U.S.”\nAlthough Donald Trump has been fiercely critical of China during his campaign, his attacks have typically focused on alleged unfair trade practices that the U.S. President-elect claims have “stolen” American jobs. The Trump administration’s trade team has been stocked with outspoken China trade hawks, such as Peter Navarro and Robert Lighthizer.\nGiven that Trump campaigned on drawing down expensive military commitments overseas, many believed any confrontation between the U.S. and China would be limited to commerce, and that the South China Sea would be less of a hotspot than it has been under the Obama administration, which stepped up naval patrols in the region.\nHowever, Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Nanjing University, says the South China Sea will now remain an “essential component” of Washington’s Asia-Pacific security strategy. “The entire U.S.-China relationship is a minefield,” he tells TIME. “There’s not one place to stick your foot.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T06:44:49.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
