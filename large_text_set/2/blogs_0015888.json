Just like regular WhatsApp messages , the new Status posts are encrypted end-to-end, meaning outsiders can't pry into what you're posting. \nStatus updates can be sent to contacts through messages and adorned with annotations, stickers and emojis. \nAccording to TechCrunch, the feature was rolled out to beta testers last November and is now making its way to users on iOS, Windows Phone and Android.

It introduced a similar feature for Instagram last August . \nThe scale of WhatsApp, which has over 1.2 billion monthly users, could deal a blow to Snapchat which is currently planning to go public.

The IPO will reportedly value Snap (Snapchat's parent company) at upwards of $25 billion. It's one of the most eagerly awaited public offerings of the year. \nLast year, Snap generated $404.5 million in revenue - nearly seven times the $58 million in sales the year prior. poll loading Which messaging app is better? 500+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:24:41.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
