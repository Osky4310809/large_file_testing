Dominic Lipinski PA Wire:PA Images 2 \nLONDON — Katy Perry used her Brit Awards performance on Wednesday night to make a not-so-subtle political statement about Donald Trump. \nDuring a performance of her hit single \"Chained to the Rhythm,\" the Hillary Clinton-supporting pop star was accompanied on stage by giant dancing skeletons apparently dressed as US President Trump and UK Prime Minister Theresa May. \nThe \"Trump\" skeleton wore a red tie and May wore a red blazer and skirt — similar to the outfits the pair wore when they met last month at the White House. \nAt one point the two skeletons held hands in another nod to their meeting, where they had a brief, awkward exchange holding hands. \nThe skeletons held hands in a nod to Trump and May's meeting at the White House last month. Dominic Lipinski PA Wire/PA Images/Christopher Furlong/Getty Images \nMeanwhile, her background dancers were dressed as white houses — at one point, one of them even fell off the stage. \nThe song's lyrics read: \nLiving our lives through a lens Trapped in our white-picket fence Like ornaments So comfortable, we live in a bubble, a bubble So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, the trouble.\" \nIt sn't the first time the pop star has made a political statement against Donald Trump during a performance. Earlier this month , she wore a white pantsuit and a \"resist\" armband as she performed \"Chained to the Rhythm\" at the Grammy Awards. \nKaty Perry was a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter during the US election. Dominic Lipinski PA Wire:PA Images \nThe Brit Awards, held at London's O2 Arena, proved an otherwise emotional evening. \nA performance from Coldplay's Chris Martin celebrated the life of George Michael, and the British Male Solo Artist and British Album of the Year awards were given to the late David Bowie for his final record, Blackstar. \nWatch Perry's performance below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:54:55.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
