Miss FRANCE Iris Mittenaere is the #65thMissUniverse ! pic.twitter.com/mFni4SHjS5 — 65th Miss Universe (@MissUniverse_65) January 30, 2017 \nIn the final question round, Miss France highlighted the benefits of open borders when asked about the global refugee crisis. \n\"In France we want to have the most globalisation that we can. We want to have the biggest exchange of people that we can. Maybe someday that will change but now we have open borders,\" Mittenaere said. \n\"Having open borders allows us to travel more through the world and to find out more about what's out there in the world.\" \nMiss Kenya, another finalist, said Donald Trump's presidency \"may not have been the choice of many people\" and divided the United States. \nShe also spoke out in support of former US president Barack Obama and said she backed Hillary Clinton to be America's first woman president. \n\"I feel once he took up his position, he was able to unify the entire nation,\" said Mary Esther Were, 27. \nMiss Colombia appeared to allude to Trump when asked why violence was prevalent in the world. \n\"Although there are presidents who don't get along with others, we work together to unite. Campaigns, respect and inclusivity to be able to have a social transformation that would educate our children,\" said Andrea Tovar, 23. \nMonday's show was headlined by US performers including Grammy award-winning rhythm and blues group Boyz II Men and rapper and Grammy award nominee Flo Rida. \nPia Wurtzbach of the Philippines won last year following a major blunder in which the host -- Emmy Award winner Steve Harvey -- mistakenly awarded the title to Miss Colombia. \nHarvey corrected the error minutes later, apologising on air to Wurtzbach and Miss Colombia, Ariadna Gutierrez. \nThe mistake featured prominently on Monday's show, with candidates and the home audience often ribbing Harvey about it. \n\"Steve, I never got to thank you but thank you for making me the most popular Miss Universe,\" Wurtzbach told Harvey at the opening of show. \nHarvey this year got through the closing moments of the ceremony smoothly. \nPageant fanatics \nThe Philippines agreed to host the pageant as part of efforts to draw tourists and investors. \nBeauty pageants are also hugely popular in the Philippines, particularly among the tens of millions of poor who see the contests as a chance for their beautiful compatriots to live a life of fame and luxury. \nBut allowing the Philippines to host has proved controversial, with critics claiming the pageant would whitewash Duterte's brutal drug war, which has left more than 6,000 people dead. \nEnvironmentalists also hit out at pageant organisers for letting the bikini-clad contestants swim last month with endangered whale sharks. \nDespite the controversies, excited fans from across the globe lined up before dawn to watch the pageant, which was held in the morning Manila time for the coveted prime American evening viewing audiences. \nFans dressed in evening gowns with a sash took selfies outside the seaside arena where the competition was held while others organised viewing parties in hotels and restaurants in the capital. \n(AFP)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T09:29:31.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
