John Lewis (D-Ga.), holding hands with President Obama, joins others in leading a walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to mark the 50th Anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights marches in Selma, Ala., on March 7, 2015. (Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) When Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said he would not attend the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump and said Trump’s election victory was not “legitimate” on the Friday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the justly venerated hero of the civil rights movement knew exactly what he was doing.\nTrump, predictably, lashed out at Lewis via early-morning tweets (what else?) on Saturday: “Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk – no action or results. Sad!” A growing list of lawmakers are now refusing to go to the inauguration in solidarity with Lewis.\nLet’s step back and recall just who Lewis is and what he did. Whether on the Freedom Rides , leading the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) or walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge (where he was savagely beaten and had his head cracked open ), Lewis put his life on the line for civil rights. He knew — indeed helped create — the made-for-TV spectacle of nonviolent protest, which was the key to grabbing the public’s attention and winning the moral fight against Jim Crow. You provoke; the authorities respond. Your nobility in accepting blows (physical in his case) makes clear who is the oppressor and who is the oppressed. Trump fell into Lewis’s trap, revealing his own inhumanity and Lewis’s nobility. This was the essence of “action,” as Trump put it. In fact, the name of the movement Lewis led has “action” in the title — nonviolent action. The man who was required to settle a lawsuit for housing discrimination in the 1970s and used deferments and a bone spur to get out of the Vietnam War had the temerity — and the vapidity — to go after Lewis. Remarkable.\nNow let’s look at Trump’s insulting remarks about Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, one visited many times by parents of two renowned universities within its borders. During the campaign, Trump falsely characterized virtually the entire black community this way — unemployed (using a bogus 58 percent figure for black youths), in danger of being shot, etc. The stereotype was grossly wrong then, and it is particularly inaccurate when referring to Lewis’s district.\nLewis’s district, the Atlanta Constitution Journal reports , “covers the majority of the land inside the [city’s] Perimeter, as well as some of the suburban communities to the south and west. It includes Buckhead and Bankhead, the Ritz-Carlton and the town of Rex, Lenox Square and Lakewood Heights — and a lot of places in between.”\nThe AJC continues :\nNearly nine out of 10 residents of the Fifth District were high school graduates or had education beyond high school, and about four out of 10 residents had at least a bachelor’s degree, according to Census estimates.\nThe largest single chunk of employed residents in Lewis’ district, about half of the civilian work force, worked in a field grouped by the Census as “management, business, science, and arts occupations.” The district includes Atlanta’s downtown and main business district, and includes the headquarters of the Coca-Cola Company in Midtown and Delta Air Lines near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It also covers the campuses of Georgia Tech and Emory University as well as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and many of the city’s major cultural and arts institutions.\nHis district also includes gentrifying neighborhoods favored by professional millennials and college professors; a raft of new high-rise apartments and large, historic Craftsman-style homes. Trump should go sometime — the restaurants, parks, zoo, botanical garden, museums, performing arts center and retail are top-notch. Lewis’s district includes some higher-crime neighborhoods but also some of the safest neighborhoods in the city . (Atlanta overall ranks 14th among cities for its violent crime rate.)\nTo recap, on MLK weekend Trump attacked a revered civil rights figure who received grave physical injuries in pursuit of freedom and equality by in essence labeling his district a crime-ridden ghetto. One can say Trump is impulsive and ignorant (does he even know who Lewis is?), but alas, he also makes negative, inaccurate generalizations about minorities. Yes, he talks like a racist. And more people know that now, thanks to Lewis — who once again prompted the press (Right Turn included) to recount his participation in the civil rights movement.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@JRubinBlogger", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/06/politics/selma-50-years-john-lewis-bridge-anniversary/", "https://www.maptechnica.com/congressional-district-map/GA/05/1305", "http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-freedom-riders-then-and-now-45351758/", "http://www.ajc.com/news/gen-politics/trump-trashes-john-lewis-district-things-know-about-5th-congressional-district/6ud2uFWqgOU0RF7vRaIpJP/", "https://www.ibiblio.org/sncc/lewis.html", "https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ga/atlanta/crime/", "http://www.npr.org/2016/09/29/495955920/donald-trump-plagued-by-decades-old-housing-discrimination-case"], "published": "2017-01-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:41:50.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
