The other one has...our audio guy.\nChad Johnson is good at football, good at video games, and more charismatic than everyone in the George R. Brown Convention Center combined (where he graciously met me for a game of Madden '17 on behalf of EA Sports). While he admits to being more of a FIFA guy, he'll happily take on anyone in Madden, and could easily do so from the comfort of his home â€” which is why I had to entice him with an above average video game experience. A custom roster was made in his honor, and he was given control of 40 Chad Johnsons (Chads Johnson?), each with ratings identical to his 2006 Pro Bowl season with the Cincinnati Bengals.\nHis opponent? A gangly, 7-foot tall version of myself with mediocre stats across the board. EA Sports made a game so great that I had to insert myself in it...even if it guaranteed my public shaming. The final score may not justify a rematch, but if it means I get to hang out with Chad Johnson again and play another EA Sports title, then let this serve as an open invitation for him to dismantle me in the virtual sport of his choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:46:48.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
