The NYX Pin-Up Pout Lipstick has a secret compartment. Like a revolving bookcase that leads to a hidden room, there's more to this under-$8 lipstick than meets the eye. Late last year, the Internet absolutely freaked out after some noticed her E.L.F. lipstick had a little something extra. The colored square on the cap of the tube popped off. Inside, there was extra product for quick color matching. Well, the NYX Pin-Up Pout Lipsticks have the same hidden feature. The circular colored top on the cap, which shows what color is inside the tube, can be disconnected (with a little force, might I add). Inside, you'll find a little pot of color. You May Also Like Makeup These are the Lipsticks in Fifty Shades Darker Worn by Dakota Johnson In the Facebook Live, we noticed that the shade is a bit lighter than the actual lipstick bullet. Also, it has a bit more shine to it. You can use the secret color on top of the lipstick for a glossy effect. (On its own, the lipstick has a creamy satin finish.) Or you can just use the hidden gloss for a more sheer wash of color. For $7.99 at your local drugstore, that's a lot of bang for your buck. However, if you hop the lipstick right this second, you'll be able to get it for $4.80. A huge sale is running on NYX lippies until February 20 on nyxcosmetics.com . Hannah Choi/Allure You can watch me discover that NYX Pin-Up Pout Lipstick has a secret compartment around the 1:30 mark in the video below. You can also see us swatch some fun colors like Smoke Me (a gray with a hint of lilac) and Wild Spirit (a deep periwinkle). More fun, new lipsticks you'll love:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T20:21:47.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
