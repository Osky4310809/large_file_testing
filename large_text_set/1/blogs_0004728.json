He would look me right in the eyes… and convince me I was wrong. He made me feel paranoid,” she said.

I went ‘Yes! I knew it…’ \n“It was a feeling of euphoria before the absolute devastation hit me – he still convinced me to stay.” \nColeen also talked about losing her sister Bernie to cancer and her abusive father. \nShe re-entered the Celebrity Big Brother house on Tuesday without her wedding ring, and recently revealed that she was treating it as a “trial separation” from her husband. \n\"We're going to do a lot of talking over the next couple of weeks, but if we can't fix it then I want us to have counselling. The next step is a trial separation,\" she told The Mirror.
