Unfortunately, a lot of women, especially in India, are subconsciously conditioned to not dream big when it comes to their professional lives. Many women forget their dreams while growing up. Girls, it's more important to be an individual than being a good wife. Thankfully, the power to reclaim all your lost dreams lies within you and now is the right time to get back to it! Pursue your dreams and here's some inspiration from the story of Jyoti Chahar who beat all the odds in life to follow her passion and rise to fame. \nYes, she too was stopped from following her dream once but never did she give up on it. So, we thought of sharing a few life lessons from such an inspiration. Go ahead and get motivated! 1. Be ready to fight for yourself because no one else will. Pexels \nJyoti's family and relatives wanted to get her married right after she finished 10th grade. However, this brave-hearted girl refused to give in and applied for her Bachelors in Mass Communication after the 12th exams. With her determination and mother's support, she could shift to Jalandhar for higher education. 2. Be passionate about your dream and work hard to achieve it. Pexels \nShe always knew that writing and Bollywood were her two passions and that she would never give up on them. Right after her graduation, she started working as an intern at a news channel. However, she worked day and night to get a job there so that she didn't have to ask for money from home. Finally, her hard work paid off and she got the job. Now Jyoti was a journalist by day and a blogger by night when she would write about movies and her opinions about them. 3. Never let the fear of failure crush your dreams. Pexels \nLife doesn't always be kind to us. As soon as you realise that you have got everything in place, life throws a curve ball at you. The same thing happened to Jyoti when her dad had a gruesome accident one day and lost his memory. She then had to leave her job and work in a call centre to support her family. 4. It's never too late to return to your dream. Pexels \nEven after all the difficulties, she didn't give up and always pursued the one thing she loved the most- her blog. With a lot of effort and a friend's help, Jyoti got a job in a big media house. Her blog was also being noticed and liked by many people but once again she was asked to leave her job. 5. Be patient and success will be yours. Pexels \nAfter all this, Jyoti decided to pay full attention to her blog and with a help of few blogger friends she came to know about UC News App's We Media program. The platform is a part of Alibaba Group which encourage budding writers and bloggers to contribute through its open and self-publishing program; it is a very easy way to reach out to more readers and earn good money. She joined it and started focusing on her blog a lot. Soon, she became a star on the platform and now the blog is her identity. Famous Indian celebrities are now tweeting about this entertainment blogger! \nJyoti Chahar, aka The Moi, teaches us an important lesson on never giving up. No matter what the circumstances are or how financially constrained you are, you just need that zeal to hone your skills and fall in love with your dreams. Everything is possible if you believe. Absolutely anything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:48:26.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
