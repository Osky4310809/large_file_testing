"JOnathan Prynn , BEN NORUM Tuesday 21 February 2017 09:53 GMT Celebrating the capital's kitchens: (L-R) Tom Parker Bowles, chef Angela Hartnett and the Standard's Grace Dent Alex Lentati \nBritain's biggest food festival is being launched by the Evening Standard this summer to celebrate London’s new status as the world’s leading culinary destination. \nLondon Evening Standard Food Month will see hundreds of events take place throughout June across the capital — from breakfast to late-night supper clubs. They will reflect the scores of exotic gastronomic traditions from around the world now represented on the streets of London. \nThe programme is being drawn up by food writers Grace Dent and Tom Parker Bowles, who are the festival’s creative directors. Dent, a restaurant reviewer for ES Magazine, said: “We’ll be eating the entire world, in one city, 24 hours a day. London loves food and we’re here to prove it.” \nThe centrepiece will be the Night Market, a bustling outdoor dining experience in a London park, inspired by the street food scene. It will run for 12 evenings from June 7 and feature up to 50 restaurants, food trucks and bars, as well as live entertainment. Full details, including the venue and ticket sales, will be announced in April. A feast of a festival: Grace Dent is co-ordinating (Jonny Cochrane) \nAs well as a celebration, London Food Month will use its influence to promote awareness of food waste and hunger in tandem with charity partner The Felix Project . \nIt also includes exclusive events with some of the most influential chefs from Britain and overseas including Massimo Bottura, owner of Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, who will be working with the Felix Project. He said: “London is a hub of gastronomy and one of my favourite cities. Thanks to the partnership with the Felix Project, we will be able to create healthier meals from humble ingredients for those who need it most.” Grace Dent: London Food Month will be a 'rolling buffet of food-fun' \nLocals and visitors will be guided by Fay Maschler, the Standard’s longest-standing critic, who will publish a list of her 50 favourite places to eat in 2017. \nLeading chefs and restaurateurs, including Angela Hartnett, chef patron at Michelin-starred Murano , welcomed the initiative as a long overdue recognition of London’s remarkable progress from laughing stock to powerhouse of world cuisine in little more than a quarter of a century. \nSam Hart, co-owner of the Barrafina tapas restaurants and Soho’s Quo Vadis , said: “Londoners have become restaurant-obsessed. When we launched our first restaurant Fino back in 2003 we had originally wanted to open a Barrafina, but didn’t feel that London was ready for a counter-only, tapas-focused restaurant. \n“Now London’s food scene has progressed to the point that there are interesting and exciting restaurants opening every day. Barrafina’s Nieves Barragán Mohacho to launch new Spanish restaurant \n“An event of this scale has great significance for the food scene and it is great for the Standard to recognise how important restaurants are to London’s culture right now.” \nNieves Barragán Mohacho, head chef at Barrafina until her departure at the end of this month, said: “The food scene in London and its diversity means that when chefs come, they stay put because nowhere can rival it. \n“When I came I intended to stay for one or two years and I’ve now been here for 18 years. The fact that a big London publication like the Evening Standard is dedicating a month to food is really important. It shows everyone, at home and around the world, just how important restaurants are in London. I am very proud to be a part of it.” \nJason Atherton, the Michelin-starred owner of restaurants such as Pollen Street Social , said: “I regularly cook in five different continents, but London is definitely leading the way. Jason Atherton: London has the world's best larder \n“We are so lucky here to have easy access to incredible ingredients from Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and the south of England, as well as from our neighbours in Europe. We have the best larder of anywhere and it really puts us ahead of the game. \n“London’s food scene has boomed over the past 25 years, going from a gastronomic wasteland to the world leader it is now. \n“When I was training as a chef everybody wanted to work for one of just a handful of top French chefs. There were two-year waiting lists for jobs with Marco Pierre White or Pierre Koffmann. That would never be the case now because there are so many great chefs and restaurants out there.” \nMartin Morales, founder of Peruvian restaurant Ceviche , said: “London is number one when it comes to food. Way above New York, Chicago, Paris or Hong Kong. That’s because of the sheer variety, voracious competition, and hunger by its chefs and foodies alike. From street food heroes to high technique champions, from those who serve true tradition to those who create tomorrow’s dishes, London is the gastronomic capital of the world.” Jason Atherton: London has the world's best larder \nJohnny Smith, co-owner of Italian restaurant Luca , said: “I love that London’s food scene has it all to offer: the restaurants, the talent and an adrenaline-like energy. Now it’s time for one of London’s leading voices, The London Evening Standard, to help shine a light on it. London can stand shoulder to shoulder with the greatest food cities of the world.” \nFoodie Instagrammer Clerkenwell Boy said: “It’s a very exciting time at the moment. There is so much diversity from street food to cutting-edge restaurants. An event like this will help dispel the myth once and for all that British food is just about sausage rolls and sunday roasts — there is so much more that it has to offer. \n“The whole industry is pushing to be better in terms of ethics, sustainability, reducing food waste and supporting future talent. That really excites me.” 35 must-try dishes in London 35 must-try dishes in London 1/36 35 must-try dishes in London \nClick through the gallery to see which dishes made the cut, and count-up how many you've eaten... 2/36 Bone marrow on toast with parsley salad at St John \nNeither restaurants or dishes get more iconic than this.
