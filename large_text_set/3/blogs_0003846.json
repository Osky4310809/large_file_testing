Iran has recently attained the capability to produce its own military hardware and equipment. \nThe Iranians might not want to get too cocky about any plans they may have to dominate the gulf region. Their memories may be short, but the United States Navy’s are not. \nIn 1988, near the end of the 8-year Iran-Iraq war, the United States was providing safe escort for critical Kuwaiti oil tankers, which supplied oil for the U.S., Japan, and countries around the globe.   \nDetermined to dominate the oil market, the Iranians made a point of attacking any tanker from another country. So much for the myth of Muslim unity. \nOn April 14, 1988, an American naval ship, the USS Samuel B. Roberts, hit a mine, identified to belong to Iran. The U.S. response was swift and sure. On April 18, the Pentagon activated Operation Praying Mantis. In a single day, U.S. air and surface units destroyed the Iranian Sassan oil platform and half of the Iranian Navy’s operational fleet, according to the U.S. Naval institute . \nIran’s exercises are taking place in the very region where millions of barrels of oil are transported daily to Europe, the United States, and Asia. Our Navy’s Fifth Fleet protects those shipping lanes. And we are ready. \nIf Iran’s leaders would prefer to forget what the United States Navy did in 1988 — and can do again — you can bet there are a lot of people willing to remind them.
