Club reports. That includes household appliances like connected light bulbs and thermostats—and, even according to one tweet on the site, a smart oven that its user was unable to turn off. \nProtect Your Lungs People with lung diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) might not be getting the benefits of treatment that they think: Many people who use inhalers make critical errors that impede their medication dosage , researchers from Rice University discovered. Errors include not shaking the inhaler—or not shaking it long enough—placing it at the correct angle, breathing properly when inhaling, and not holding their breath for 10 seconds after inhalation. As a result of these errors, a lot less medication than necessary is reaching patients’ lungs. \nTest Your Heart Properly Testing for a common heart condition may often yield inaccurate results , researchers from the University of Leicester discovered.

The cost for these cases? Over $343 million each year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:12:59.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
