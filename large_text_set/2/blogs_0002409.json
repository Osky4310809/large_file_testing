Gov. Nasir-El-Rufai \n“Selfish political considerations should not be allowed to have a place in how census is conducted. The decision of the Commission to conduct a biometric-based census is, therefore, a step in the right direction as this will eliminate manipulation of census figures and the outcomes of the census credibility. \n“The task of managing the country’s population is huge and too strategic for the nation and cannot be left alone to the Commission. \n“I, therefore, urge government at all levels, traditional institutions, religious leaders and civil society to support the Commission in this noble bid. \n“Any investment in population programmes will yield dividends in terms of improving the welfare of the people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:29:39.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
