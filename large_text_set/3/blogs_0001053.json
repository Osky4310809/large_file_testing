A weight bench in the far corner has been his companion, along with the silence in his head that has drowned out the beats thumping through the speakers and the roar of dozens of fellow NFL prosepcts working out alongside him. \nSurrounded by many but alone in his zone, the star filled his recent weeks in this room and on nearby fields to prepare for his next big moment, at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis. There, the spotlight would burn its brightest, with more eyes watching, more cameras flashing, and more critics scrutinizing his every move and every word. \nChristian McCaffrey, a former Valor Christian and Stanford running back, is the latest of the McCaffrey clan to test the NFL, following the lead of his father, former Broncos wide receiver Ed McCaffrey. The son of a star who grew up around stars could be an even bigger star. With a rare combination of versatility, strength and smarts packed into his 5-foot-11, 202-pound frame, Christian could be a first-round draft selection April 27 amid a deep class of running backs. \nBut when he’s in his head and on the field, he plays as if he’s unknown. A disrespected unknown in the Class of 2017. \n“I play with a chip on my shoulder always,” McCaffrey said Thursday at the scouting combine. “I feel like a lot of people don’t give me credit for my skills and talents. That’s just the way it is. … I’m constantly trying to prove myself.” Andy Cross, The Denver Post McCaffrey training in Colorado last month for the NFL combine. \nIn December, McCaffrey made the hardest decision of his career when he announced he would skip Stanford’s bowl game against North Carolina to begin his combine and draft preparation. He was criticized for being selfish and disloyal to his teammates. Supporters said he was wise to protect his healthy and his future. \nBehind closed doors, surrounded by his teammates, McCaffrey received a standing ovation. \n“I have the best teammates in the whole world at Stanford, and coaches, honestly,” he said. “Every single one of them supported me, had my back. I was very fortunate to have that.” \nBut the reaction didn’t stop there. NFL executives would ask — some already have — why he skipped the bowl game during their 15-minute interviews with him at the combine. \n“You know what, I understand it now,” said Broncos general manager John Elway, who met with McCaffrey on Wednesday. “Obviously when I thought about it, kind of the old school in me wanted to come out and say, ‘Why? Why would those guys not play? It’s their last game,’ and this and that. But I tell you what, when you look at where the league is now and you talk about the value of these contracts for these players coming out and the risks that they’re taking, the old salty guy in me got flipped back to understanding. I understand why they didn’t play.” \nAdded 49ers GM John Lynch on Thursday: “As a Stanford fan, I wasn’t a huge fan of that. … I think you understand their perspective, but I don’t necessarily think it’s a positive thing for college football. This is such a team sport — I know there are people that I’ve talked to here that that really bothers. I’m fortunate. With one of those players, I happen to know the young man (McCaffrey). So I would never question his commitment to team, but other people will.” \nUnderstanding why requires understanding where — where McCaffrey came from and where he hopes to go. \nIn Colorado, where his father starred as a Bronco, McCaffrey has broken from the shadow to become arguably the state’s most talented professional prospect since basketball star Chauncey Billups. His versatility and production have served him well as he shattered Stanford and NCAA records in rushing and all-purpose yards, and was the Heisman Trophy runner-up as a sophomore in 2015. \nBut with his name and success have come expectations and even a renewal of a stereotype as the white running back. And doing many things well has created even more questions, about fit, and how his skills translate to the pro level. \n“From my perspective, McCaffrey’s a matchup guy,” NFL Network draft expert Mike Mayock said. “He’s a chess piece. He averaged … between 6 and 6.5 yards a carry. He’s an outstanding pass catcher. He’s bigger and tougher than people think he is. And he’s also a return guy. So you’ve got to have a plan if you draft him with the first-round pick as to how you want to utilize him, especially based on what you have on your roster already.” \nWherever he’s wanted, he will play, McCaffrey said. At the combine, he will perform as a running back. He needs an impressive 40-yard dash time to quash doubts about his speed. At his pro-day workout at Stanford, he will run routes to show NFL teams the receiving skills he has honed with the help of former Broncos wide receiver Brandon Stokley in Colorado. \nAnd as a returner, well, check the tape. At Stanford, he ran back 56 kickoffs for 1,479 yards and a touchdown, plus 34 punts for 380 yards and a touchdown. In the NFL — especially in Denver — skill players with the desire and know-how to contribute on special teams are coveted. \n“I think it’s important just to show everything I can do,” McCaffrey said. “It’s something I pride myself on, being extremely versatile. To show coaches I can play running back, I can play receiver, I can do all the return game stuff. That’s important to me.” Christian Petersen, Getty Images Christian McCaffrey of the Stanford Cardinal looks on from the sideline in the AFC Championship game between the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Jan. 24, 2016 in Denver. \nMcCaffrey, wearing a Terrell Davis jersey at the AFC championship game in January 2016. \nThe thought has crossed McCaffrey’s mind, just as it has crossed the minds of Broncos fans. What if he became a Bronco and followed the path of his father? Denver needs a reboot in the running game, it needs a clear No. 3 receiver and help in the slot, and it needs a star in the return game. McCaffrey could check multiple boxes while helping to jump-start two phases that the Broncos struggled with last season. Vance Joseph, Denver’s new head coach, labels McCaffrey “a pro’s pro,” while Elway has called him “a dynamic player who can do it all.” \nSo what if? \n“That’d be awesome. That’d be great,” McCaffrey said of becoming a Bronco. “I’d love to play there. It’s kind of hard to be a fan of anywhere anymore because you start to wind down things and you don’t know where you’re going to end up, so I’ll be happy to play for anybody.” \nMaybe that’s what McCaffrey thinks about when he sits on that weight bench, his head down and his mind lost in his own untouchable space. Maybe he goes back to being the unknown and disrespected running back with plenty to prove. \nOr maybe the picture is a little bigger. \n“Growing up I wanted to be an NFL football player,” he said. “That’s what you dream about when you’re playing peewee, when you’re a freshman in high school to a senior in high school, then you get to college and it starts becoming a little more real. Sometimes you have to sit back and appreciate where you’re at and kind of reflect on all the times you’ve had in the game of football.” THEY SAID IT \nWhat the Broncos and others in the NFL have said about running back Christian McCaffrey, a former Valor Christian star, at the scouting combine in Indianapolis: \n“He’s a dynamic player who can do it all. Wherever he goes, he’s going to have an impact immediately.” — John Elway, Broncos general manager Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:39:08.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
