Inigo Figuracion Updated February 09, 2016 . \nWith San Diego's awesome weather and spectacular scenery, it's no wonder locals are also big dog lovers. With so much to do outdoors, it only makes sense to have a canine companion alongside when you’re out and about, either walking through the neighborhood or strolling along the boardwalk or stopping at a coffeehouse. But dogs also need a place where they can let go and romp around and be, well, dogs. Luckily, San Diego has a variety of off-leash dog parks. \nSan Diego has some specifically designated outdoor spots to take your dog to socialize with others of their ilk and do whatever dogs love to do: you know, sniff, bark, growl, chase, pant, and, uh, mark. Here’s a rundown of some of the more popular doggie-friendly designated dog off-leash areas around San Diego County. \ncontinue reading below our video Best Road Trip Apps And remember to adhere to each area’s rules and regulations, which may differ. Rancho Bernardo Park – Rancho Bernardo \nThis northeast San Diego off-leash dog park is located at 18448 West Bernardo Drive in Rancho Bernardo. The 2.5 acre park offers leash-free space adjacent to Rancho Bernardo Community Park, and includes additional parking for dog park users. Wells Park – El Cajon \nThis 1.4 acre spread within El Cajon's Wells Park is the East County's second leashless dog park and is a grassy haven for pooches. It has gravel and grassy sun areas and dual drinking fountains (for pets and their owners). Located in the southwest part of Wells Park at 1153 E. Madison Avenue, the off-leash area is open daily from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. and is lighted for night use. Dog Beach – Ocean Beach \nLocated in northern Ocean Beach , Dog Beach is the original beach spot to take your pooch in San Diego and remains popular. This beach area is located at the west end of the San Diego River Floodway, also known as the Ocean Beach Flood Control Channel. With a wide swath of sand and the Pacific surf to roll in, Dog Beach is a special place to bring your mutt, or just to come and watch dogs be dogs in the surf and sand. Open 24 hours. Fiesta Island – Mission Bay \nMost of this large sandy island in Mission Bay is designated leash-free for dogs. It has lots of sandy dunes to romp in, and the calm bay waters lets the more adventurous dogs take a quick dip. Open 24 hours. Nate’s Point – Balboa Park \nThis is an enjoyable setting for dogs and owners alike. A large grassy lawn in the middle of Balboa Park is the perfect place to play catch with balls and frisbees, and to socialize – both for the dogs and their owners. Located along Balboa Drive at El Prado , on the south side of the Cabrillo Bridge. Open 24 hours. Morley Field – Balboa Park \nMorley Field is located on the east side of Balboa Park, northwest of the tennis courts. This off-leash dog spot is ideal for residents of nearby North Park.
