Australia pays Nauru and Papua New Guinea to keep more than 2,000 asylum seekers — mostly from Iran, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka — in conditions condemned by rights groups.\n\nThe process of “extreme vetting” has yet to be explained.\nU.S. officials were sent to Nauru within days of the deal’s announcement in November after the U.S. presidential election. But they left this week with arrangements under a cloud.\n“I don’t have any comment to make in relation to when U.S. officials will be on Nauru next,” Dutton told reporters. “There have been officials there who have left … in the last couple of days and we would expect other officials to be there in due course.”\nRefugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said most of refugees on Nauru who had been accepted by the United States as candidates for resettlement had initial interviews with U.S. officials in what they had been told was a two-step process.\nBut there have been no second interviews so far, Rintoul said.\nAustralia has determined that there are 1,600 genuine refugees among 2,077 asylum seekers on Papua New Guinea and Nauru. There could also be refugees among the 370 asylum seekers who came to Australia for medical treatment then took court action to prevent their return to the island camps.\nAs of last week, Nauru held 1,132 asylum seekers including women and children. The Manus facility in Papua New Guinea housed 818 men with another 127 male asylum seekers living elsewhere in Papua New Guinea.\nAustralia has said the “most vulnerable” refugees on Nauru would be given priority for U.S. resettlement.\nAfter committing to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that he would honor the agreement, Trump tweeted that it was a “dumb deal.”\nAsked last week whether the deal would continue, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens.”\nPapua New Guinea was on Thursday accused of breaching the rights of 60 asylum seekers who have been told they are about to be deported.\nThe 60 have had their refugee claims rejected and one has already been removed from the men-only Manus facility, said Ben Lomai, a lawyer representing them.\nMost of those targeted for deportation were from Iran, with others from Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Bangladesh.\nOne asylum seeker from Nepal was put on a commercial flight Wednesday night and told he was being returned to his home country, Lomai said.\nLomai was preparing an application for the court in Papua New Guinea on Thursday asking that the deportations be halted. The asylum seekers already have separate court applications pending asking that they be resettled in Australia, and Lomai said it would be unjust to deport them before those matters were heard.\nAustralian Attorney-General George Brandis defended Papua New Guinea’s legal right to deport the men, saying their refugee claims have been investigated and rejected.\nThe Papua New Guinea government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:27:11.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
