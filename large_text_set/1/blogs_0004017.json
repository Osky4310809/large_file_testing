They were roundly abused and threatened with violence. The group were reportedly threatened (Photo: BPM MEDIA) \n“One lady was particularly angry and a group of young men started to become very abusive and confrontational, accusing them of being racists, which of course they are not. \n“They started jumping in between the dancers and knocking off their hats. The dancers tried to explain why their faces were painted black, but they would not listen. \n“They tried in vain to explain but things took such a turn for the worse that the performances had to be abandoned.” \nThe Alvechurch group featured in the Mail last week after more than 100 villagers watched their annual New Year’s Day performance. They were also accused of racism for wearing black face (Photo: BPM MEDIA) \nThe dance group, dressed in black and with black painted faces, gave a traditional rendition of a mummers play where they slayed a dragon to crowds outside the Crown Inn pub. \nThe historical dancers, who formed a group in 1989, perform centuries-old dances including the White Ladies Aston, the Dilwyn, The Evesham Stick Dance and the Bromsberrow Heath. \nMorris dancers have performed with black face make-up since the origins of the dancing tradition in the 16th century. \nKnown as ‘Border Morris’ the tradition sees performers wearing a full-face of black paint in order to disguise themselves. \nOne theory is that it started when impoverished 16th century farm workers had to conceal their faces to avoid being recognised while begging during winter, as asking for money was illegal.
