The same is true of the new game streaming features, which work with NVIDIA's GeForce graphics card lineup to blast games from a PC to a nearby television — 4K HDR game streaming is something many enthusiasts have been waiting a long time for.\n\nFinally, NVIDIA has announced a milestone for its own Steam game store: 1000 titles fully optimized for the Shield box, compatible with the newly-updated controller.\nThe announcement comes alongside a new peripheral, the NVIDIA Spot , which works as a voice assistant for, well, Google Assistant, connecting to the Shield and facilitating Google Home-like functionality from anywhere in the house.\nThe updated NVIDIA Shield Android TV will start shipping later this month for $199, with pre-orders beginning now.\nSee at NVIDIA \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:35:28.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
