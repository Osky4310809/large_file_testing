You cannot come and ridicule me here; I will not have you do that to me! These two gentlemen defrauded me and sold my property.” \nEarlier at the proceedings, the 3 rd defendant, who was not represented by any lawyer, told the court that he wanted to change his counsel because he suspected that his counsel had a cordial relationship with Atiku or had been bought by her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:37:44.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
