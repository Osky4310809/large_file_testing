And, though, every time they’ve recovered with public apologies, it is not long before they have their oops-I-did-it-again moment. \nThis time, the ignorance is too damn high in their latest ad that TRIES to capture the attention of curvy women. Bold and full of hope, the words “Love your curves” are splashed across the ad like a transformative chant. Only that instead of full bodied women, the brand has collaborated with slender, ramp-worthy models for the ad. Now, we have nothing against skinny women (because we are inclusive AF, grown-ups) but what in the world are they doing on an ad that endorses a Body Curve denim line? This is literally like showing bushy legs on a hair removal commercial or an acne-covered face on a skincare one. You have got to be shitting me, Zara. pic.twitter.com/tiOsJv5AVy — Muireann O'Connell (@MuireannO_C) February 28, 2017 \nThe ad went viral when Irish radio host Muireann O’Connell spotted the irony and took to Twitter. Ever since, she’s been retweeted nearly 10,000 times. Conscience may be too much of a quality to expect from such profit-driven brands but for once, a little logic may not hurt. Also, you didn't fool no curvy women, Zara!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T12:48:55.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
