He started the game well enough, throwing a touchdown pass after a fumble gave the ball to the Houston Texans on the Pats’ 12-yard line in the second quarter. But he also has two ugly interceptions and is averaging roughly 4 yards per attempt. He has been shy to test the Patriots deep, and is still completing under 60 percent of his passes despite the steady diet of dump-offs.\nBut then, something incredible happened — serendipity. Rookie receiver Will Fuller ran a go route, and Osweiler confidently stepped up into the pocket and unleashed a gorgeous 45-yard bomb. This was it. As the ball came down for a certain touchdown, he could see the headlines tomorrow: Brock’s Redemption. All Fuller had to do was hold on ...\nNo.\nOh no.\nPoor Brock Osweiler. He was paid an exorbitant amount of money to be one of the worst starting quarterbacks in the NFL. He has taken a ton of criticism, even for a guy with a big paycheck, and he deserved to have that one thing go right. Some guys are just so bad that they can’t even get lucky.
