For every two additional technical fouls Cousins receives throughout the remainder of the season, he will be automatically suspended for an additional game, per NBA rules. \nThe fine was issued to Cousins for \"making an inappropriate statement and (middle finger) gesture\" after the Kings' 109-106 overtime win over the Golden State Warriors on Feb. 4. \nGALLERY: WEEK 14 NBA POWER RANKINGS Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:47:10.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
