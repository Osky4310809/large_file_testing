From the Daily Caller :\nLahren’s show is suspended for effect for at least one week starting Monday, according to TheDC’s sources. A source with direct knowledge of the situation previously told TheDC that Lahren’s contract with the company goes until September, but that she may leave the company before then.\nThis announcement follows a rather ominous tweet by Glenn Beck yesterday responding to Lahren’s defense:\nWait, libertarian views? Help me out on Trumpcare, stimulus, and executive orders. Trump is anything but libertarian. #intellectualhonesty https://t.co/jlt5sFvQMP \n— Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) March 20, 2017 \n\nAll of this started last Friday when Lahren appeared on The View and announced she was pro-choice:\n. @TomiLahren explains why she's pro-choice: \"Stay out of my guns and you can stay out of my body, as well.\" pic.twitter.com/0kFXJ7oL9L \n— The View (@TheView) March 17, 2017 \n\nThere seem to be several different reactions to this announcement. On the one hand, some people seem to see the idea of a pro-choice woman acting as a conservative spokesperson on television, since that view is out of step with the right. Then there are those who were offended by how Lahren presented her views. Here’s what she actually said:\nI’m pro choice, and here’s why. I am a constitutional, y’know, someone that loves the Constitution. I’m someone that’s for limited government. So I can’t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I’m for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies. I can sit here and say that as a Republican and I can say, you know what, I’m for limited government, so stay out of my guns and you can stay out of my body as well.\nMaybe Lahren didn’t intend this, but what she said is that she holds these views because to do otherwise would be hypocrisy, i.e. anyone who supports the 2nd Amendment but is pro-life is a hypocrite. So she has now insulted a significant portion of the conservative audience including, apparently, her boss.\nAnd speaking of hypocrisy, when did Lahren’s views on the life issue change? It must have been very recently because, as the Federalist points out , just a few months ago she was talking like a pro-lifer:\nOnly 3 months ago, @TomiLahren considered an abortion to be murder, today, she branded pro life conservatives as hypocrites. #NoPrinciples pic.twitter.com/8BqoQTOyD1 \n— The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) March 17, 2017 \n\nThree months is a very short time to traverse the massive philosophical and political divide between “baby killers” and “stay out of my body.” It would be one thing is Lahren had been pro-choice on her own show and then announced a hardcore pro-life position on The View. That would suggest someone who had made a big shift but was sticking to their own internal convictions despite the resistance from the immediate audience. But that’s not what happened here. Instead, it looks as if Lahren has been telling each audience what they wanted to hear. And if that’s true on one of the fundamental issues dividing the major parties and the country, it could be true on other issues as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:31:16.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
