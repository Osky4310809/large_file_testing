But I recently tried out one of the new ColourPop Crème Lippie Stix formulation that debuted with the Valentine's Day collection , and now I'm hooked. The best part? There are six new shades to choose from. The new set of neutrals launched yesterday; and at $5 each, I'm definitely adding a couple to my cart. So how have the ColourPop lipsticks changed my dark ways? It's all about the new formula. I've tried a lot of lipsticks in my days as a beauty editor (including the old Crème Lippie Stix), but I've never encountered one like the new ColourPop Crème Lippie Stix. The soft texture of the product is similar to that of a lip oil . When you swipe it on, you'll find that the product melts like butter on toast. It even leaves a glossy, '90s finish that Cher Horowitz would envy. Plus, it gives my little lips the illusion of plumpness without the tingling sensation of an actual lip plumper . That's a huge win in my book. You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T17:07:05.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
