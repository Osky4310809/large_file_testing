Posted 13 hours ago 34 \nDUM... DUM DUM D M! I'm sure you all know what song it is. You asked for this and we'll give it to you. \nMetallica \"Master of Puppets\" \nWriters: Cliff Burton, Kirk Hammett, James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich Producers: Metallica, Flemming Rasmussen Album: Master of Puppets (UG Score 9.5) Recorded: October-December 1985 Label: New Electric Way, Music for Nations, Elektra Genre: Thrash metal \nAdditional Information: #3 in VH1 the greatest heavy metal song ever. In March 2005, Q magazine placed it at number 22 in its 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks list. Martin Popoff's book The Top 500 Heavy Metal Songs of All Time ranked the song at number 2. The song also ranked number 1 on a 100 Greatest Riffs poll conducted by Total Guitar magazine. Story behind the song \nThe title track to Metallica's 1986 album, \"Master of Puppets\" highlights the negative consequences of the use of alcohols and drugs, like addiction and inevitable death. It clearly distinguishes heavy metal from hard rock. If G'NR were to write a song about drugs, like Mr. Brownstone and Nightrain, they would put more emphasize on the enjoyment aspect of it. \nAt more than eight minutes long, the thrash metal masterpiece displays drugs as the master and us as the puppets — in fact, the thing mimics the ever-repeating pattern of an addict. It kicks off with that remarkable three-note descending riff and chugs ahead with the excited, expectant feel of a scouring junkie in seeking drug or the money with which to buy it. At three or so minutes in arrives a beautiful, calm guitar solo — the pleasure of the high itself. Then we’re back on the hunt. The numbness is gone and the \"MASTER. MASTER.\" is in control yet again. \nThere are two ways the song is played live. There is one where they just play the song how it is usually played in its completeness, and another where they play the first two verses, and when it's time for the instrumental part they play another song (\"Nothing Else Matters\" or \"Sanitarium\") and when that song is over they continue the final verse of \"Master Of Puppets.\" When Metallica played shows in China in 2013 and 2017, the Chinese government instructed them not to play this song - perhaps not wanting to feed disturbance with lyrics about being controlled by a greater entity. The band complied, although the band played the riff of this song during their sets. Music Videos Live version \n\"Master of Puppets\" is the band's most played song of all time, first played on December 31, 1985, at San Francisco's Bill Graham Civic Auditorium for a crowd of 7,000. \nThe song has been performed live more than 1500 times. \nLive on the Howard Stern Show in 2016. Behind the scenes \nThis video has featured all four current Metallica members explaining what the monumental album \"Master of Puppets\" meant to them. \nThe video, dedicated to 30th anniversary of \"Master of Puppets\" album, recorded in 2016. Famous covers \n\"Master of Puppets\" has been covered by multiple artists playing various instruments. \nSum 41 live cover. \nViktoriya Yermolyeva performs \"Master of Puppets\" on a piano in Zurich, February 19, 2011. \nApocalyptica performs \"Master of Puppets\" live in 2006. Gear and settings Guitars \nKirk Hammett \nJackson Flying V \"Randy Rhoads\" has black, neck-through body, Micro EMG 81 humbuckers, Tune-O-Matic bridge, 2 volume controls, 1 tonality control and Gotoh Tuners. \nKirk started playing it in 1983, just after recording \"Kill 'Em All\", and used it during recording sessions of \"Master of Puppets\" album, which he almost completely recorded with this guitar. Kirk got this guitar directly from the Jackson factory and had to wait two hours for the adhesive to finish drying so that it was solid before taking it with him. \nGibson Flying V (UG Score 8) has black finishing with white pickguard. It was equipped with 2 stock pickups (which were changed to EMG 81s in 1987), a set neck, 2 volume controls, 1 tone control. \nWas the main recording guitar for the first four albums. \nJames Hetfield \nJackson King V Custom \"Kill Bon Jovi\" (1985) was used by James for the recording of the album Master of Puppets in 1985, and occasionally during the subsequent tour. \nThe guitar actually predates Dave Mustaine's first Jackson – who is one of the people responsible for promoting Jackson guitars in the early years and making them popular. James' King V was made on May 24th, 1985, and featured white body finish, Tune-o-matic bridge, Grover Tuners, and two Seymour Duncan Invader pickups (presumably requested by James himself). In 1987 James removed the original pickups and replaced them with EMGs 81/60. Few months after that, the neck on it was broken and James just didn't bother repairing it. \nJackson company wanted James to promote their guitars, to which James said \"no\" because he preferred Explorers. Eventually, he made his decision clear by adding a sticker saying “Kill Bon Jovi” over the guitar’s original logo on the headstock. \nCliff Burton \nCliff Burton chose Aria SB-Black'N Gold I as his partner and played it on the band's first three studio albums. \nThis bass guitar became the basis of Aria Pro II Cliff Burton Signature Bass, released at NAMM 2013 created in homage to Burton. Amps and effects \nKirk Hammett and James Hetfield \nMesa-Boogie Mark IIC+ amp (re-wired as a pre-amp) has the reputation in vintage circles as one of the best Boogies, next to the classic Mark I, due to their much-praised rhythm channels, and to a lesser degree their lead channels. \nThe Mark IIC featured a quieter foot switching system and a new mod to the reverb circuit. The Mark IIC+ was the last of the Mark II series and featured a more sensitive lead channel and, more importantly, an improved circuitry in the effects loop. \n100W Marshall JCM800 2203 100 watt power amp is one of the most highly respected 100W Marshall heads in the company's long history. Developing from the legendary Plexi head, it was one of the first Marshall amps to feature a master volume control. The essence of simplicity, the JCM800 is a one-channel, all-valve amp with no reverb or effects. \nFor Master of Puppets, both James and Kirk started using Mesa Boogie amps. They were both playing through Mesa Boogie Mark IIC+ slaved into modded 100W Marshall JCM800s used on the previous album. Marshall 4x12 cabinets were their choice for cabs. \nKirk Hammett said in an interview to GuitarWorld in 1991: A lot of people think I actually came into my own sound on that song. That had everything to do with buying Mesa/Boogie Mark II-C heads. Boogie made those heads for a short time in the mid-Eighties and only made a limited amount of them. They moved on after that, and they haven’t really been able to recapture that sound since — I don't know if they ever tried or not. But there's something about Boogie Mark II-C heads that were really unique and very individual in their gain stages and overall sound. Most of Master of Puppets was tracked with Boogie heads and Marshall heads combined, and I used my Gibson Flying V and my Jackson. \nCliff Burton \nCliff Burton mostly used Mesa Boogie and Ampeg cabs, but it's hard to say which of these he was using during the recording of \"Master of Puppets.\" \nMesa Boogie 4x12 Cabinets Ampeg SVT-1540HE Classic Series Enclosure Amp settings", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:43:54.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
