Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nShaun King, senior social justice writer for the New York Daily News, is a champion of many progressive causes, but police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement are once again front and center in his mind as he presents his latest column . . @ShaunKing : @realDonaldTrump ’s first month in office sees most people killed by police since 2015 https://t.co/d8lfFaVq3s pic.twitter.com/II6DnbwEwo \n— New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) February 7, 2017 \nThat’s a pretty shocking statistic to see in print, considering President Trump hasn’t even been in office for a month. \nTrump is President, the Justice Department is about to be in the hands of a team who could care less about police brutality, and we just experienced the deadliest month at the hands of American police since 2015. \nPresident Trump’s first month in office ended with at least 105 people killed by American police. That’s the highest number of people killed by American police in any one month since 2015. \nInauguration Day was Jan. 20, right? It’s been so long we’ve forgotten who was running things until then, but there are reportedly photos of him kiteboarding with multibillionaire pal Richard Branson making the rounds today. \nMaybe (OK, probably) King is well aware that he’s fudging the numbers and just doesn’t care: “… because Trump’s claiming jobs gained for January, and because the major police unions all endorsed Trump, I’m going to go ahead and place this number squarely on his desk.” Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:51:59.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
