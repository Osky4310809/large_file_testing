But after a stunning election victory that saw Mr. Trump seize the mantle of populism, becoming a hero to working-class white voters and promising to “drain the swamp,” the Democrats hope to establish a different theme: Mr. Trump’s nominees would become by far the wealthiest cabinet in modern history. Some, like Ms. DeVos and Andrew F. Puzder, the pick for labor secretary, are notable Republican donors, far removed from the lives of many of Mr. Trump’s voters. The other show in (another) town Mr. Trump is, as a general rule, disinclined to cede the spotlight. On Wednesday, as his nominees labor through confirmation hearings, the president-elect is expected to hold his first formal news conference since July, in New York. (A note of caution: Mr. Trump has a record of scheduling and then postponing promised events.) \n  To critics, the timing is unsubtle. Mr. Trump, they say, is hoping to deflect attention from any unsavory revelations that might emerge from the hearings. Even his admirers concede that Mr. Trump, a consummate showman, has a gift for tactical distraction. Still, reporters will welcome the chance to question Mr. Trump on no shortage of topics — from his skeptical response to the intelligence community’s consensus on Russian interference in the presidential election to persistent concerns about his business entanglements and conflicts of interest. Oh, and one more thing Twenty-four-hour news networks rarely have 24 hours’ worth of news to cover. Wednesday might be the exception. Though no date has been set, the Senate is planning to gather midweek — with Wednesday as the likeliest day — for a marathon session known as a vote-a-rama, which comes as Republicans are charging ahead with efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The Senate is moving toward passing a budget resolution that would help clear the way for the law to be gutted. The approval of the budget measure is not, as its name might imply, about passing a budget. Rather, it is one of a series of steps that Republicans plan to take to unravel the health care law in a way that will not expose them to the prospect of a Democratic filibuster . In the interim, Republicans will have to endure the vote-a-rama, where dozens of amendments can be considered in rapid succession. The downside for Republicans is that Democrats can propose amendments that might force them into politically uncomfortable votes. And after already slogging through a day of nomination hearings, the senators will take little comfort in this scheduling reality: If the vote-a-rama begins on a Wednesday, it might well end in the wee hours of Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T12:10:14.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
