I am sorry for my friend #Ranieri . He will remain in the history of @LCFC , in the heart of #Leicester fans and all football lovers. â€” Roberto Mancini (@robymancio) February 24, 2017 \n\"I am sorry for my friend Ranieri,\" Mancini wrote on Twitter. \n\"He will remain in the history of Leicester, in the heart of Leicester fans and all football lovers.\" \nMancini, 52, has been out of management since losing his job at Inter, who he was leading for a second spell, last August. \nHe previously managed in England with Manchester City, leading the club for three-and-a-half-years and winning the title in 2012. \nMancini has also taken charge of Fiorentina, Lazio and Galatasaray.
