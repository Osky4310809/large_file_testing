Ian Rapoport of NFL .com reported Monday his \"understanding is the Texans aren't an option\" for the free agent quarterback. Rapoport also noted the New York Jets job is off the table after agent Mike McCartney said the team agreed to a one-year deal with signal-caller Josh McCown. \" Soâ€¦ he may just wait,\" Rapoport added when assessing Cutler's situation. Rapoport previously reported retirement was a possibility for the former Chicago Bears quarterback: As for the Jets, Adam Schefter of ESPN noted Cutler was scheduled to visit them before they signed McCown. That leaves him without a team at the moment despite the fact he was a 2008 Pro Bowler, led the Bears to the NFC Championship Game in the 2010 season, is just 33 years old and has seven seasons of more than 3,000 passing yards on his resume. While durability is a concern after he played just five games last season and his 146 interceptions are a testament to his tendency to make ill-advised throws, Football Outsiders ranked him among the top 10 quarterbacks in the league in defense-adjusted yards above replacement and defense-adjusted value over average as recently as 2015. It would follow that someone like that is still a viable option, especially since the NFL isn't exactly loaded with sure-thing quarterbacks. Players such as McCown, Mike Glennon and Brian Hoyer have commanded headlines and earned contracts this offseason, but Cutler will apparently need to wait for a potential injury or another opening to do the same.
