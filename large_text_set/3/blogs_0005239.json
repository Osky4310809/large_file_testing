Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDavid Haye suffered a career-threatening defeat against Tony Bellew , who stopped the Hayemaker in the 11th round to cast doubt on his career. \nHaye rolled his right ankle and appears to have sustained severe damage to his Achilles, but he confirmed his desire to return - ideally against the Bomber. \n\"I have to take my hat off to Tony Bellew. He was the better champion,\" Haye said. \"He has bigger balls than me. You done me. I’d love to do it again. \n\"I’ve never been in a fight like that before. If the fans would want to do it again.\" \nHere, we look at five possible opponents for his return to the ring.

Bellew has already confirmed he is open to doing it again though. \n\"So much respect for David as a fighter,\" the Liverpudlian said. \"We can do it again!\" \nHaye concedes he would have to travel, potentially to Manchester or Liverpool, to make this happen, not to mention taking much less money. But redemption is priceless and if he can avoid injuring himself again, he could very well win the rematch. \nAfter all, before the injury in the sixth round, Haye was winning this fight despite his lack of accuracy due to loading up too much on his power shots.

Neither fighter would likely be prepared to gradually climb their way back up the rankings given their age, so this fight could be a way to salvage their careers.

So Haye could be in contention to be the New Zealander's mandatory challenger somewhere down the line. \nHaye would have to accept a mandatory terms and the short end of any purse split - 17 percent if left to purse bids - but he is in no position to be a diva in negotiations. \nParker has shown a willingness to travel to the UK in the past and Haye can offer the profile the Kiwi might crave to break through as a global star. Instagram Retirement \nThe cold truth of the matter is that Haye's injury could be career-threatening - so retirement is an option as he faces the undefeated father time. \nAfter soldiering on for six rounds and evidently grimacing simply standing on his right ankle, Haye may have done severe damage to his right Achilles. \nAt 36 years old, does he have the fight and the battle to overcome a lengthy period of rehabilitation? Maybe not.
