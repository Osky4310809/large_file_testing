Other generals have served as national security adviser — notably Brent Scowcroft and Colin L. Powell — but the president seems reluctant to cast a net much wider than the officer corps. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was comfortable dismissing Mr. Flynn in part because he had “somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position.” He seemed to be referring to Robert S. Harward, a retired vice admiral and Navy SEAL, but Mr. Harward later turned down the job . The search for a new adviser has been complicated by uncertainty in the foreign policy world about the role of Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, who has been given a seat on a cabinet-level National Security Council committee. Mr. Harward was said to have expressed concern about how much autonomy he would have had. Mr. Petraeus was said to have similar concerns, although some close to Mr. Trump said he was never a serious candidate. Photo John R. Bolton in 2011. Mr. Bolton served as President George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations. Credit Steve Hebert for The New York Times A White House official, who like others insisted on anonymity to discuss the search more candidly, rejected reports that Mr. Harward had been concerned about a lack of autonomy in the role, insisting that he had been promised full personnel and structuring authority to clean house. Mr. Bannon was Mr. Harward’s biggest supporter in the West Wing for the national security adviser role, whisking him into a secret meeting with the president on Monday. The one candidate who has not emerged from the armed forces is Mr. Bolton, an outspoken conservative respected by Mr. Bannon, although it is unclear whether Mr. Bannon is supporting him for the national security position. Mr. Bolton does have support from two important donors to Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the White House process: Sheldon G. Adelson, the casino magnate, and Rebekah Mercer, a prominent philanthropist. Mr. Bolton shares Mr. Trump’s strong antipathy toward the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by former President Barack Obama, and he would presumably continue the tough approach begun by Mr. Flynn of pressuring Tehran over its ballistic missile program and its sponsorship of terrorist groups. But Mr. Bolton has also taken a stronger position on Russia than Mr. Trump or Mr. Flynn. In a recent op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, he seemed to try to reconcile that by agreeing with Mr. Trump’s criticism of Mr. Obama’s New Start arms control treaty with Russia.
