And he’s particularly awful for women. We’ve been over this before, but let’s just take a quick look at his track record, shall we? Just in case you’ve forgotten about the awfulness.\nHe’s the original proponent of defunding Planned Parenthood. Yup, he introduced the first-ever Congressional bill proposing the organization’s defunding back in 2007. He tried to redefine “rape” in an attempt to limit access to abortion services. Under a bill he co-sponsored, only “forcible rape” would be an acceptable cause for seeking an abortion. (Quick question: WTF is non -forcible rape, Mike Pence?) He’s possibly the biggest anti-choice politician in government today. He signed every piece of anti-abortion legislation he saw as governor of Indiana, including one bill mandating burial or cremation services for fetal tissue. In 2002, he said that condoms are “too modern” and “a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases.” So he’s anti-choice, anti-birth control, and–bet you could guess–also against women in the workforce. He once said that “day-care kids get the short end of the emotional stick” and that children with working mothers suffer “stunted emotional growth.” So women are basically just baby factories. Oh yeah, he also doesn’t think women should be in the military. Because Mulan . And that’s only a partial list of his abhorrent view of and effect on women. So how does it make any kind of sense that Pence will be receiving a “Working for Women” award this week? What kind of women’s organization would possibly give this man an award? Oh, unless it’s a prank. Is it a prank? Something Carrie -esque, maybe?\nNope, unfortunately it’s not a prank. It’s the Independent Women’s Forum. If you’re wondering what kind of group that is, know that Kellyanne Conway is on the board. (Though she’s on a “temporary leave of absence.”) Suddenly that makes a lot more sense, right?\nThe group’s mission is “to improve the lives of Americans by increasing the number of women who value free markets and personal liberty.” Members have written articles arguing that, for example, A Day Without a Woman is a “defamation of men” and that kids’ television programming striving to stay “relevant” by embracing social issues is “damaging kids.” They believe “government intrusion can lead to less economic opportunity for women” and celebrate “modern feminists” like … Margaret Thatcher?\nAs for the Working for Women honor,\nThe award recognizes an individual who values free markets, works to create a more dynamic and innovative work world, and celebrates the valuable contributions women make to society.\nFree markets over free choice? (Because for some reason we can’t have both?) Sure. As long as you ignore that whole “personal liberty” part of their mission statement, that sounds like Mike Pence, I guess.\n\n(via NY Mag , image via Shutterstock)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
