Schaefer works for the Inquirer. More by Mari A. Schaefer Arrow icon \nA petition has been launched asking the national leadership of the Girl Scouts, who have marched in inauguration parades for a century, to skip Friday's celebration. \nHeather C., a junior troop leader, will deliver the petition on Moveon.org to Sylvia Acevedo, interim CEO of the Girl Scouts, when it reaches the goal of 150,000 signatures, LehighValleyLive reported . \nThe petition had collected more than 135,000 by 11 a.m. Thursday. \n\"Donald Trump has repeatedly made statements that are not only antithetical to everything GSUSA purports to value, but which are directly harmful to women and girls,\" Heather C. stated. She said tradition is not a reason to normalize Trump's \"blatant misogyny.\" \nThose opposed to the decision took to social media with their objections. \n@girlscouts supporting a pres who literally aims to end women's rights is NOT civic engagement & it sends a horrible msg to your members \n— samantha pitchel (@ssamanthaa) January 18, 2017 \nWith all the things he's done & said about women & girls, it's particularly angering to hear the Girl Scouts are going to #Inauguration \n— asha bandele (@ashabandele) January 19, 2017 \nGirl Scouts participating in the inauguration? Call if you think that's gross, wrong, and disappointing. 800-478-7248. #GirlScouts #boycott \n— Jessica Craven (@Craven7Jessica) January 18, 2017 \nIn an announcement posted on the GSBlog the organization said about 75 Scouts were expected to march and participation in the 2017 Presidential Inaugural Parade was voluntary. \n\"At Girl Scouts, our Movement is made up of individuals who hold political beliefs and convictions as varied as our nation itself,\" the blog said. \n\nThe Scouts indicated members would also participate in protests Saturday. \n\"Then, the very next day, Saturday, Jan. 21, women and girls, including Girl Scouts, from across the country will descend on Washington to participate in the Women's March and similar events in communities across the country,\" the organization said. \nJanuary 19, 2017 — 2:00 PM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
