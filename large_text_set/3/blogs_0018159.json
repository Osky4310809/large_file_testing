Turner on the front (Picture: SWNS) Who will feature on it? \nGovernor of the Bank of England Mark Carney said: ‘I am delighted to announce that J.M.W. Turner has been chosen to appear on the next ÂŁ20 note.\n‘Turner is perhaps the single most influential British artist of all time. His work was transformative for the art world. His influence spanned his lifetime and well beyond.’\nHereâ€™s how to spot a fake ÂŁ5 note Turner was chosen using the new character selection process, which involved a two month nomination period between May and July 2015,\nIn total 29,701 nominations were received for 590 characters.\nCarney added: ‘The range and breadth of these nominations is testament to the UKâ€™s achievements in the arts. The Banknote Character Advisory Committee did an outstanding job of working through these nominations.\n‘Their help in reaching this decision was invaluable.’\nThe polymer notes are said to be more durable and secure (Picture: Bank Of England) What will the note look like? \nThe note will feature J.M.W. Turner’s self-portrait which is currently on display in the Tate Britain, one of his most significant paintings, The Fighting Temeraire, the quote ‘light is therefore colour’ from an 1818 lecture by him and his signature.\nWhen do the old ÂŁ5 notes run out? Paper fivers are about to become collectibles Will they be meat-free? \nThe Bank of England was criticised shorty after the new ÂŁ5 notes were introduced after it emerged that the new notes contained animal fat.\nYet despite an investigation and a legal battle, the bank said it would not withdraw the current notes from circulation as it would cost the tax payer too much.\nBut in terms of the ÂŁ20 notes, the bank has reportedly held off on signing supply contracts so that it can explore plant-based substitutes, and this would likely take a few months to trial.\nA final decision on how they will be made will be announced in the summer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:08:43.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
