Hazard is challenged by Matteo Darmian \n\"A tactic to play and go to kick an opponent? It's not football for me. I don't think that I'm crazy and I see only him in this situation. \n\"Sometimes when you play against players with great talent, you try to intimidate those players. \n\"The referee must protect these type of players. When they go out with a bad injury... \n\"It's very dangerous to receive a kick from the back.\" Ander Herrera was sent off after just 35 minutes, with both yellows coming for challenges on Eden Hazard \nIn what was a fiery contest, Conte and Mourinho had to be separated by fourth official Mike Jones as the Italian took exception to United's heavy challenges. \n\"What happened on the outside for me is only (a) circus,\" Conte added. \"The coaches are not important.\" A fiery first-half saw Antonio Conte confront Jose Mourinho \nHowever, Conte did praise the fourth official, saying: \"He was very good to manage this situation, but for sure it's normal when you play this type of game.\" \nConte and Mourinho did eventually shake hands in the tunnel after the final whistle, as Chelsea advanced to the semi-finals where they will face Tottenham at Wembley. Conte gestures on the touchline \nChelsea beat Tottenham in December, but Spurs ended their 13-match Premier League winning streak at White Hart Lane on January 4. \n\"We start with one win for us and one win for them,\" Conte said. \"For sure it'll be an interesting game, very strong for both teams.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:38:53.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
