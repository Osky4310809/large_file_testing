Check them out and get some serious inspiration for your own. By Jenny McCoy Tuesday, January 31, 2017, 10:17 am Medioimages \nBullet journal. The name sounds intimidating, but the concept isn’t. Essentially, it’s a personalized organization system that can include any (usually all) of these things: a to-do list, sketchbook, notebook, and diary. Conceptualized by Ryder Carroll , a digital product designer living in Brooklyn, these catch-all planners have been cropping up across the internet (search #BulletJournal or # BuJo on Instagram and you’ll get hundreds of thousands of results), and much of their popularity is due to the fact that you can use almost any kind of notebook to do it, and the system is totally customizable. \nYou can record as much or as little information as you want, in whatever format is most useful for you. Of course, runners have been keeping journals for a while— here are 20 runners who’ve logged over 100,000 miles in their journals —but because this organizing system is specifically useful for goal setting and advance planning, bullet journals have been catching fire with runners—who record everything from training plans, to miles run, to shoes worn, to sore muscles—and then some. And many of them are as beautiful as they are useful. \nHere, eleven runners let us take a peek inside their bullet journals and share what they’ve learned from all that logging. Their responses have been condensed and edited. 1/11 Photograph courtesy of Kristin Saling Name : Kristin Saling Location : Lorton, Virginia Bullet journaler for : four years Experience with running : I was a sprinter until I joined the Army, and then I had to learn how to run long distance. Sixteen years, four marathons , ten half marathons , and a lot of 10K s later, I love it, but I’m still learning how to run and train better . ​ This bullet journal tracks : My training plan for the Hapawa Half Marathon—including which days I was supposed to run and how far—as well as my goals and motivation for the race. On a separate page, I also recorded how I did on each run—from mood to sore muscles to which shoes I used (tracking shoe life is important!). Inspiration : I wanted a consolidated spot to look at my workout and my progress, and wanted to save information that lives in several different apps in my phone all in one place. Since the Hapawa Half, I’ve run the Disney Wine and Dine 5K, 10K, and half marathon, and the Army Ten Miler, and I'll be running the D.C. Rock and Roll Half, the Cherry Blossom Ten Miler, and the Kentucky Derby Half Marathon this spring. Each race has its own dedicated training log! Time spent creating log : 15 minutes Time spent updating log per week : 10 minutes How bullet journaling has impacted running goals : It lets me better gauge when I can ramp up my training and when I need to ease off, and when I need to watch a potential overtraining injury. 2/11 Photograph courtesy of Kyle Scollin Name : Kyle Scollin Location : San Jose, California Bullet journaler for : three years Experience with running : My passion for running really began when I was in college, and I’ve been running pretty consistently for the past six years or so. I love planning new routes to take, finding new areas of the neighborhood, and zoning out as I listen to my music . This bullet journal tracked : My progress training for the Brooklyn Half Marathon. Each tree represents a single run that I’ve taken, and inside of each tree I write the mileage. Inspiration : I can get to be pretty lazy and I needed something to keep up my excitement of running. I had tried apps like Zombies, Run ! and I liked how they worked in this idea that the more you run, the more you can build up your “city.” So I came up with the idea of building a scene the more I ran. On deciding what information to log : The main point of this spread is just to keep me motivated to run and continue to generate the scene. In this case, I decided that I would write in just the mileage. I’m not too concerned about my time as long as I can go the distance. I still use an app ( RunKeeper ) to track the full details of my run if I get curious. Time spent creating the log : Around two minutes Time spent updating the log each week : Less than five minutes How bullet journaling has impacted running goals : I run to stay active and healthy. Ultimately, the bullet journal helps me stay focused and continue to be active. 3/11 Photograph courtesy of Kate W. Name : Kate W. Location : Auburn, Alabama Bullet journaler for : two years Experience with running : I’ve been running off and on since high school, but running has only become a consistent part of my life in my 30s. I’m a middle-of-the-pack runner who is out there to have fun and to challenge myself, not to break the tape. This running bullet journal tracks : My training plan for the Auburn Classic Half marathon. I created a schedule of planned runs, cross-training workouts, and, because I was recovering from a hip injury at the time, physical therapy sessions. As I worked my way through the plan, I then recorded the actual workout I wound up completing each day in parenthesis. Because I’m only human, my planned workouts and my actual workouts varied, so I wanted to record both what I intended to do and what I really wound up doing. I also kept track of my goal time/pace for the race as well as target paces and actual paces for different types of runs (e.g. 400s vs. 800s vs. tempo runs). On deciding what information to log : Laying out my complete training plan in one place is the most important thing. It helps me see the big picture and also keeps me mindful of big training days that are coming up when I’m making plans for the future. My next priority is simply logging the workouts as I complete them. I really enjoy seeing the record fill up with successfully completed runs — being able to see all the miles I’ve put in gives me a psychological boost, especially if I have to skip a run or two along the way. I can see the big picture and remind myself that a couple of missed runs won’t ruin my plans. Time spent creating log : 15 minutes Time spent per week updating log : Less than 10 minutes How bullet journaling has impacted running goals : Keeping track of my training plans and logging my runs in my bullet journal has mainly kept me organized and helped give me a little extra nudge to follow through on my plans. I find that I’m the kind of person who feels committed to something once I put it in writing, and bullet journaling is a really simple way to do that. 4/11 Photograph courtesy of Kim Alvarez Name : Kim Alvarez Location : San Diego, California Bullet journaler for : two and a half years Experience with running : I’ve loved running ever since I was a kid. I ran track and field in high school. This bullet journal tracks : My progress with a Couch to 5K program. I denoted the days I planned to run with a box and checked them off once I completed the run for that day. Also, anticipating the possibility of excuses, I wrote my “why” statement at the top of log: “It centers me, makes me feel good, and it’s awesome.” And I also put an encouraging message across the bottom to help kick me back into gear: “Make a plan and work the plan.” Inspiration : I chose a yearly format because I wanted to a have an overview of my running plan and progress for the year. Being able to visualize the runs by week helped motivate me to complete the runs—I wanted to check off that I ran. On deciding what information to log : I made a simple plan of the days I committed to run and marked them once complete. I didn’t write down the exact length of time, miles, or the intervals because I was only interested in making sure that I ran. Time spent creating log : 10 minutes Time spent updating log per week : Less than one minute How bullet journaling has impacted running goals : Bullet journaling keeps me accountable by allowing me to record my goals and the action steps needed to achieve them. Having that level of accountability of checking in and updating the log is a simple, yet powerful visual method. 5/11 Photograph courtesy of Julie Arthur Name : Julie Arthur Location : Newport, North Carolina Bullet journaler for : one and a half years Experience with running : I began running in October 2015, mostly to help with my weight loss. I have lost 73 pounds so far, and am now at my goal weight. Even after I lost the weight, I was so in love with running at that point that I started just running for fun! My first half-marathon, the Crystal Coast Half Marathon, will be in March of this year. I’m planning to run the full 26.2 at the Outer Banks Marathon in November. This bullet journal tracks : Marathon and/or half marathon training plans (left side) and summaries of long runs (left side), including time, pace, and other details, like what I wore, what I ate before and after, what the weather was like, etc. Each long run is written in a different color so it’s easy to quickly look back on them, and every completed long run is denoted with a backslash on the training page. Inspiration : Technology is nice, but handwriting my lists, goals, and other important things makes me feel more connected to my life and allows me to really think about what I’m writing. Time spent creating the log : 30 minutes Time spent updating log per week : 30 minutes How bullet journaling has impacted running goals : It’s allowed me to realize what’s important to me and what works or doesn’t work in terms of setting goals and keeping track of them. It’s also something really relaxing that I look forward to after a long day or a long run. When I get settled in after my long runs or hard speed workouts, I can’t wait to sit down at the table and write about how I felt during my run. It’s really helpful to look back and see what I ate before and after a run, how I fueled, how the weather affected my pace, etc. For example, on a recent long run I had cheesecake the night before, which made me really sluggish and slow. But the previous long run of the same distance, I had a healthy dinner the night before and I was 7 minutes faster than the cheesecake run! 6/11 Photograph courtesy of Jena Name : Jena Location : Victoria, British Columbia Experience with running : I’ve mostly been a runner to facilitate my participation in other sports like soccer and field hockey, but have come to enjoy the challenge. Now, I try to at least run a few races a year. Bullet journaler for : one year This bullet journal tracks : My training plan for the Victoria Half Marathon. The crossed out boxes were my rest days (or days when I had vacations planned so I knew I wouldn’t do any runs even if I scheduled them). Every time I completed a run, I’d check the box and add a quick note about what I did, logging either distance or time. Inspiration : I use my bullet journal for pretty much everything else, so rather than have another place to keep track of something, I figured keeping it in the same location would work and then it would also be easier for me to check my calendar to make sure that I can schedule the time for the runs. On deciding what information to log : I log my food and water intake in my bullet journal already, so my running page just logged the distances or times that I ran. I log my speed and such with a running app on my phone, so this was just for planning purposes. Time spent creating the log : 1 hour Time spent updating log per week : Just a few minutes How bullet journaling has impacted running goals : Having the plan written down definitely made me feel more accountable for actually completing the runs. If I didn’t do a run, I had to put an angry X or cross off the planned run, which isn’t as much fun as a check mark or a smiley face. 7/11 Photograph courtesy of Kim Holmes Name : Kim Holmes Location : Huntsville, Alabama Bullet journaler for : four years Experience with running : I started running in 2011 by joining local training groups and have found a family in the local running community. Now, I run ultras, serve on the track club board and lead a trail running group. This bullet journal tracks : Miles I’ve run, the quality/type of each run, and what shoes I wear (I track miles on each shoe so I know when to replace them). When I’m training for a big race—like the Pistol Ultra 100K race I did last year—I also track what I eat. I usually come up with a color-coded system to make things easier. Time spent creating log : 20 minutes Time spent updating log per week : Less than an hour How bullet journaling has impacted running goals : The first big race I tracked in my bullet journal was a challenging 50K (the Mountain Mist in Huntsville) where I was worried about time cutoffs. I would train on segments of the course, so I logged the times of those runs so I could practice keeping under the cutoffs. I know without a doubt that keeping track of my times as I trained on the course is what helped me survive that race! Since then, it’s mainly just kept me on track in training and also gives me a visual reminder of how hard I’ve worked to reach a goal. I love looking back on my pages training for my first 100K—they make me so proud! 8/11 Photograph courtesy of Jo Morris Name : Jo Morris Location : London, United Kingdom Bullet journaler for : three months Experience with running : I used to run as a teenager, but stopped after an ankle injury . I started running again regularly in the past year—I wanted to build an all-around training routine involving cardio, as well as strength-training and sports. Running started out as a small component of that, but actually, I love it, and am now training for my first ever race (a 10K) in just a couple of weeks. The bullet journal tracks : The log on the left tracks my progress towards running 60 kilometers in a month. For each kilometer that I run, I fill in a box. The log on the right tracks all of my running, yoga and other cardio workouts. My runs are denoted in orange and I log the distance and pace of each run. Inspiration : First and foremost, I am a scientist, so I love data! While I do have running apps on my phone, I use a couple of different ones, so I wanted a place where I could compile all of my information in an easily accessible way. I also find that it gives me a good overview of my training schedule, so I am able to create a more balanced running plan involving long runs, recovery runs, tempo/speed intervals, etc. And I can more easily schedule my runs around my other commitments, because my journal is also a diary/planner. On deciding what information to log : As a very novice runner and bullet journaler, I am really only tracking the basics - things like distance and pace. As the months progress, I find these are good metrics to see if I am improving in these early stages, as well as to set challenging but realistic goals for myself. At the end of the month, I like to analyze my data to see if I have done any new PRs, how many kilometers I have run, and average pace, etc. In the future I might add things like comments or thoughts on my runs. That’s the nice thing with the bullet journal system - you can add and change exactly what you want to track, and how you want to track it, as the weeks and months go by. Time spent creating log : 35-40 minutes Time spent updating log per week : 10-15 minutes How bullet journaling has impacted running goals : It means I am actually setting goals in the first place! I have set myself the challenge of running my first 10K race, and depending on how that goes, it will allow me to set new goals for myself for the rest of the year and beyond. 9/11 Photograph courtesy of Ariel Hamilton Name : Ariel Hamilton Location : Provo, Utah Experience with running : I’ve been a runner for as long as I can remember! I ran track in elementary and middle school and cross country all four years of high school. Even now, at 25 years old, I’m keeping my passion alive with half marathons. Bullet journaler for : one year This bullet journal tracked : My weekly training schedule for the Park City Trail Series Half Marathon, including the distance and focus for each run. I’d check the box every time I completed a run. Inspiration : I wanted something to log my runs, so I Googled “running trackers” and found a template that I modeled this off of. Time spent creating the log : 2 hours Time spent updating the log per week : 10 minutes or less How bullet journaling impacted running goals : It definitely kept me accountable for each of my runs—It bothered me when I had an “unchecked” box if I skipped a run, so it motivated me to keep running every day. 10/11 Photograph courtesy of Rosanna Jackson Name : Rosanna Jackson Location : Palo Alto, California Bullet journaler for : two years Experience with running : I’ve been a runner for on and off about 12 years. I used to train a lot and race for time, but as I’ve gotten older, I just want be able to run when I’m 75, so I run for fun. I like to register for races because then I have to get out and run. Without a race on the calendar, I’ll stop running. This bullet journal tracks : My mileage as I trained for the Golden Gate Half Marathon. I’d log my individual runs and then total up the mileage at the end of the week. I had stopped running and was starting from zero, so wanted to increase my mileage slowly so I wouldn’t get injured. On deciding what information to log : It’s hard to know what information is most important. The inclination is to include everything at first—how I felt, location, pace, weather. I had a more comprehensive log that someone gave me a long time ago, but I only ever filled in my pace and mileage. Now that I’m not as concerned about being fast, I only record my mileage. Time spent creating the log : 10-15 minutes Time spent updating the log per week : Less than 5 minutes How bullet journaling has impacted running goals : Recording my miles for the day was one of my rewards for running. I enjoy looking back and appreciating how much I’ve accomplished. It’s like a big pat on the back. If I don’t run, then there’s a big blank space in my log and that reminds me that I need to get out there. 11/11 Photograph courtesy of Kimberly Job Name : Kimberly Job Location : Orem, Utah Bullet journaler for : A little more than a year Experience with running : I’m still very much a beginner. I’ve been using the Galloway Run-Walk method and increasing my mileage slowly. This bullet journal tracks : Simply the number of miles I run. Every day I run a mile (or more), I write the date in the box and and color it in. On deciding what information to log : This tracker was simply a tally sheet for fun and motivation. It’s surprising how inspiring it can be to watch the page fill up and see all that you’ve accomplished. Time spent creating log : 5 minutes Time spent updating log per week : 15 minutes How bullet journaling has impacted running goals : Using a bullet journal is an extra piece of motivation to get my run in. It’s surprising how motivating coloring in a little box can be, and it’s satisfying to be able to look back and see how far you’ve come.
