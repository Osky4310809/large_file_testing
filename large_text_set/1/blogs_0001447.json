King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 12 hours ago 0 Five Finger Death Punch guitarist Jason Hook revealed the band has officially wrapped up their new album, marking the follow-up to 2015's \" Got Your Six .\"Chiming in from his BMW, Jason noted via Instagram: \"Our new record is finished! Listening to the mixes on my way thru Starbucks at 7:39am this morning! Hello 2017 here we come!\"The album will be released later this year via Rise Records as the group's 7th studio effort.In one of the previous interviews, Jason said about the band's non-stop-work approach: \"We're workaholics. Every time we talk about taking a break, it just doesn't feel right. Sitting around - it just feels like we could be doing something. We're always concerned that we might lose momentum or that people will stop caring. I think we're overachievers by nature.\" A photo posted by Jason Hook (@jasonhook_5fdp) on Dec 31, 2016 at 11:14am PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:03:24.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
