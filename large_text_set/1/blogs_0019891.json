It works some of the time, or the results are only temporary, and it never gets the full results you deserve. And there's a reason why. It's time to unlearn everything you have always been told to be true about how to get in shape. It's time to stop listening to the pundits and get a metabolic reset. \nHere are the most important factors to rev your metabolism: 1. Get proper sleep. \nFor every two hours of sleep you lose you impair your weight loss by roughly half a pound! Worse than that, if you don't get at least seven hours of sleep you can kick up ghrelin, your hunger hormone, into overdrive. There's a reason you're reaching for the office candy jar! So get your Zzz's. The best part? Your body does deep repair when you sleep, which burns more calories than exercise. 2. Drink enough water. \nI know if you loved water you would drink all you need. But most people are dehydrated, which slows weight loss and optimal health. In fact, you need to drink half of your body weight in ounces. Here's a tip to get your hydration on point: If you weigh, say, 160 pounds that's 80 ounces. The easiest way to stay hydrated is to simply drink five pints: Drink a pint when you get up, another at 11 a.m., one at 1 p.m., 3 p.m., and 5 p.m., and you are done for the day! 3. Manage stress. \nI can't stop your boss from driving you crazy or shorten your long commute to and from work, but I can tell you right now that stress is slowing your weight loss, affecting your hormones and attacking your thyroid. Here are three easy tips to de-stress your day: Take 4 to 5 minutes to meditate or breathe deeply to reset your stress hormones and prime you for best weight loss and a positive mood. Exercise 8 to 10 minutes in the morning or at lunch, this will boost your serotonin (feel-good hormone) and decrease cortisol (your stress hormone that packs on the pounds and slows your metabolism). Brew yourself a nice cup of herbal tea and say h. Lemon balm, an herb in the mint family, is the best de-stresser in aiding a deep, restful sleep, which means—you guessed it—better weight-loss results 4. Eat the right foods that work for your chemistry. \nDo you ever feel bloated or gassy after a meal? That's your body saying loud and clear, \"Please don't feed this to us!\" Skip the calorie counting, and instead eat the foods that make you feel good. You can use my book, The Metabolism Plan , to find the foods that make you 110 percent. 5. Stop exercising so darn much. \nThough you may have found an exercise routine that you think works for you, you could be exercising too much and at the wrong times. Exercising too intensely can affect hormones that slow your thyroid function like cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone. These skewed hormones affect your thyroid, the master gland of your metabolism. Overexercising also affects your endocrine system, which creates even higher levels of cortisol. Does all of this sound like one big negative feedback loop? Well, yes, right now it does. But that's OK because now you are going to be in charge and find what works for you. \nPairing these tips with a customized meal plan can kick your metabolism into high gear. Your One-Day Metabolism Reset Diet \nThese are all foods that are anti-inflammatory, which is essential for boosting your metabolism. Inflammatory foods raise cortisol levels and cause hormonal imbalance and rampant yeast growth, which disrupts thyroid function, your master gland for your metabolism.
