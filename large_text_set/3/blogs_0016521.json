Hogan on health care bill \nAt a rally in Lawyers Mall in Annapolis, Congressman Elijah Cummings, Congressman Steny Hoyer, Congressman John Sarbanes, and Congressman Jamie Raskin call on Governor Larry Hogan to oppose the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act currently before Congress. (Joshua McKerrow) John Fritze in Maryland's congressional delegation held a rally in Annapolis on Monday in an effort to pressure Gov. Larry Hogan to publicly oppose the Republican health care plan headed toward a vote in Congress later this week.\nDemocrats in Maryland have been trying for months to get Hogan, a Republican, to speak out against the repeal of Obamacare , noting estimates that show hundreds of thousands of state residents would lose coverage and that the budget would take a $1 billion-plus hit under proposed cuts to Medicaid . \nHogan has said he supports the Medicaid expansion that was part of the Affordable Care Act — signed into law seven years ago this week — and that he wants no one to lose coverage under whatever legislation ultimately emerges in Washington. \nBut that posture isn't as strong as some other Republican governors — including Rick Snyder of Michigan and Brian Sandoval of Nevada — who wrote a letter late last week saying the legislation moving through the House to repeal and replace Obamacare \"does not ensure the resources necessary to ensure no one is left out\" and that it \"shifts significant costs to states.\" \nHouse Republicans are scheduled to vote on the measure on Thursday, but leadership is still trying to win support from within the caucus. House Speaker Paul Ryan is expected to announce changes to the bill ahead of the vote, but no one knows yet specifically what those changes might be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:21:02.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
