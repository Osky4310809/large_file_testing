The PM’s “This lady’s not for talking” routine, dodging legitimate questions on the NHS, ensured her regal visit backfired spectacularly. \nThe Labour leader’s office plans to dispatch Corbyn to Stoke on Friday if Labour is successful – and ­Copeland too should both remain coloured red on the electoral map. \nYet the relief mixed with enthusiasm should Labour hold both, and I make no prediction, might merely paper over the deep fissures. \nIt would be a Dunkirk moment, salvaging as much Labour support as possible, not a D-Day offensive ­signalling an inevitable march on Downing Street and a majority in the House of Commons. \nJeremy Corbyn pays for secret opinion poll on whether he should quit before 2020 Corbyn's chorus is quietening (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \nBecause Dr Nutty, a former Tory dressing as if he’s a country squire rather than from Bootle, wouldn’t even be in with a shout if Labour was electrifying the party’s working class heartlands. The same goes for the Tories sniffing an upset in Copeland when Labour must convert ­Conservatives across the country to return to high office. \nIt’s been claimed that losing ­Copeland would be the first time since the 1982 Mitcham and Morden by-election that an opposition lost a seat to the ruling party. But the Labour MP in that contest defected to the SDP. \nSo better comparisons – or much worse for Labour if ­Copeland turns blue on Thursday – are Brighouse and Spenborough in 1960, where it ceded the ­constituency to a merged Conservative and National Liberal candidate.

I’m losing count of prominent Left-wingers publicly endorsing Corbyn while privately branding him a liability. His chorus is certainly quietening. \nOn LBC radio a few Fridays ago, I devoted an hour appealing for Jezz-uits to sing his praises. This time last year we would have been inundated by callers. This month I had just one. Labour’s in a deep hole. \nStoke and Copeland determine if it has halted the descent or is still digging.
