He is first seen after the performance, \" Daughters of Triton \" with Ariel after sneaking away. When Ariel confesses she is in love with Eric, she strikes a deal with an evil sea witch . Flounder joins Ariel in Eric's Kingdom as she tries to win his heart. \nBecause he can't survive above water, he is forced to only be able to get news from Scuttle or Sebastien nearby water. He was persistent in asking if they were kissing, showing how dearly he wanted Ariel to get her happy ending and how supportive he was. \nFlounder joins Sebastian , Scuttle and other fish in the song \" Kiss the Girl \". Later, Flounder helps Ariel defeat Ursula who is planning to capture Ariel by battling Flotsam and Jetsam . When Ursula is killed, Flounder attends the wedding and gets a big good-bye kiss from Ariel as she and Eric enjoy their marriage. Edit Flounder in the animated series. \nFlounder appears in all the episodes of the prequel television series, sharing constant adventures with Ariel. He generally tries to serve as a voice of reason in comparison to Ariel's more adventurous nature, but usually goes along with her anyway. He is often seen giving rides to Sebastian, who cannot swim as fast as Flounder or Ariel. According to the television series, when Flounder's name called Guppy Number 35 . In the episode \"Land of the Dinosaurs\", when he has been found frozen in an ice cube, Ariel thaws him with King Triton's trident and he gets a cold resulting in his sneezing. \nThe episode \"The Evil Manta\" shows that Flounder and Ariel met as young children, though Flounder initially mistook Ariel for a large fish that intended to eat him. The same episode shows Flounder outsmarting Evil Manta , who had been trying to spread prejudice throughout Atlantica. Flounder simply fakes believing Manta's words then works with Ariel to fix the problems Manta caused. The episode \"The Beast Within\" has Flounder being bitten by a dangerous Howling Hairfish; he then begins to transform into one himself. However, Ariel is able to cure him with the assistance of silverfish. Edit An adult Flounder with an older Ariel in The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea . \nFlounder has a small role in The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea . He is first seen at the celebration of Melody 's birth and isn't happy about Ariel's decision to keep Melody away from the sea and insists she should explain everything to Melody, which she doesn't. He is later seen 12 years later where he is reunited with Ariel and takes part in the search for Melody. He is shown as an adult and became a father himself, having five children of his own. He is also shown as braver than he was in the first movie. \nAs the search continues, Flounder and Ariel spot the two stingray pets of Morgana (the antagonist of the film) in the grounds of the palace. The duo follows them to the sea witch's lair, where they believe Melody is being held captive. Whilst Scuttle heads off to warn Eric, Flounder and Ariel enter the icy fortress, only to find themselves captured, along with Melody. Whilst Ariel falls under a hostage situation at the hands of Morgana, Flounder is imprisoned alongside Melody, only to be freed by the princess' companions, Tip and Dash . After a battle ensues and Morgana meets her defeat, however, peace is restored and both the land and sea are free to coincide in harmony as they did years before. Edit Flounder in The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning . He has a larger role in The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning , in which he first meets Ariel (contradicting the TV series) and later unknowingly leads her to the Catfish Club, where he works as a waiter, but dreams of being a part of the the Catfish Club Band . His characterization is notably different in this movie; he doesn't scare as easily and is much more carefree and high-spirited. It is possible that he became more worrisome after the first few adventures with Ariel. He's obsessed with music, constantly humming and beatboxing even at inappropriate moments, which, given that music is forbidden in Atlantica, lands him into trouble on more than one occasion, but which also helps others keep their spirits up, most notably when his beatboxing kicks off the reprise of \"Jump In The Line (Shake, Senora)\" when he, Ariel, Sebastian and the Catfish Club Band are on the run from Atlantica. Cameos \nFlounder makes a brief cameo in the Hercules: The Animated Series episode \" Hercules and the Apollo Mission \", seen after Hercules accidentally knocks Icarus into a fountain, who emerges from the water with Flounder. \nFlounder made occasional cameos in the television series House of Mouse . In the episode \"Suddenly Hades\", Pete flooded the club to prevent Hades from attending the show. However, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian stayed as guests instead. A running gag in the show includes Flounder being served alive as Ariel's dinner. This was notably seen in \" The Stolen Cartoons \" and \" Goofy for a Day \". In \" Big Bad Wolf Daddy \", Flounder was seen amongst the crowd of Disney characters cheering on the titular character during his musical number. \nFlounder makes a small cameo as a freshwater fish when Bagheera and Colonel Hathi tumbled into the river in The Jungle Book 2 . \nIn Moana , Flounder is seen amongst the tapa cloth fishes during \" You're Welcome \".
