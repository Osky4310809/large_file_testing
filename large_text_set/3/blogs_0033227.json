I thought my coach was joking. I mean, I've definitely done over 100 burpees in a workout before, but that was broken up by other exercises. Thirty was probably the most I had done at one time, so 100?! WTH. And I pay for this?!\nBut I did it. And I didn't die! It took me over 10 minutes and by the end I collapsed to the floor, heart racing, panting, and muscles burning, but so proud. I thought that if I did this 10-minute workout every day, it'd be a quick way to get in a little extra much-needed cardio, build my endurance, get stronger, and burn some bonus calories.\nSo I committed to 100 burpees a day for two weeks. My rule was that they had to be 100 consecutive burpees, so even if I did burpees in my CrossFit class that morning, they didn't count toward the 100. I wrote down the numbers one through 10 in my fitness journal, started the timer, and every time I did 10 burpees, I'd cross off a number. It made counting them easier and also gave me a little break in-between. I even got my kids help me count!\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/EyJ-TJz-9gG6uHzT1ddIrdE6qRs/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/30/751/n/1922729/a1b4441736b7bd32_100-burpees.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/cujjO2iEILpCTOKjdjAQCurq0Bc/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/30/758/n/1922729/7e9931ee821d9770_100-Burpee-Challenge.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-30T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:10:44.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
