Tories subjecting civil servants to ‘stream of ill-informed criticism’ \nThe engineering firm chairman said parts of his business were almost “entirely dependent” on the single market to operate. \nMs May is expected to put withdrawal from the European Court of Justice and the end of the right to free movement as red lines in her negotiation. She will outline details in a speech later this month. \nShe has said she wants Britain to get “the best deal” and maximum trading access to European markets. However, restricting movement and ending ECJ enforcement of regulations would by definition almost certainly bring Britain out of the single market. \nThe Government was warned against “muddled thinking” by its outgoing chief diplomat to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, this week. He quit his post early, catching the Government by surprise. \nHe was reportedly frustrated at the inability of Brexit Secretary David Davis and Trade Secretary Liam Fox to understand briefings about the European Union.
