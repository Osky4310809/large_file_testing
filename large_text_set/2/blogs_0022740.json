It serves nearly 700,000 patients in 38 different countries and, according to the most recently available tax form, takes in more than $300 million a year in revenue. Most of that money comes from its clinics and pharmacies in the U.S. \nWeinstein is a controversial guy . He's enraged fellow LGBT and AIDS activists by opposing the use of PrEP , a prescription drug that prevents the contraction of HIV. AHF spends a lot of money on different ballot measures . In November, it spent $5 million on Proposition 60, which would have forced pornographic performers to use condoms. And it spent another $19 million on Proposition 61, which aimed to lower the price of prescription drugs by limiting how much the state of California could pay for them. Both measures failed. \nThus far, AHF has spent more than $4 million on Measure S, with much of the money going to all those billboards. \nSo why is a healthcare nonprofit backing a measure that seeks to curb density and development? Weinstein's clearly put off by a proposed development across the street from his office, the Hollywood Palladium towers, which AHF is suing over . Weinstein has said he thinks Hollywood development has gone way too far and in general, believes Los Angeles is becoming too urbanized. As he told us in March, \"People moved here for the L.A. lifestyle. And that's a lifestyle that I love. If I wanted to live in Manhattan, I would live there.\" He claims that the issue of housing unaffordability affects poor people, and AHF serves poor people, therefore the issue falls well within his purview. \nPlenty of people agree with Weinstein: a handful of former politicians like Richard Riordan, Gloria Romero and Carmen Trutanich have endorsed Measure S, along with a bevy of neighborhood council members, homeowners associations and local activists ( you can see the full list here ). Measure S is touting the support of the L.A. Tenants Union, which is a very small, very new (started in 2015) ragtag group that fights evictions but has very little money or clout or even members. Mayor Eric Garcetti speaking at a \"No on S\" press conference Hillel Aron \nWho Is Against It \nIt is perhaps ironic that the two biggest donors on either side of the Measure S battle are neighbors. The Miami-based developer Crescent Heights, which is building the Palladium towers across the street from Weinstein's office, has given about half a millions dollars to fight Measure S. Numerous other developers have chipped in, but the other big spender on the No side is the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, which is running a parallel No campaign . Most of the city's unions are against Measure S, which they say will hurt construction jobs. \nOther Measure S opponents include Mayor Eric Garcetti, every City Councilman with the exception of David Ryu (who has not yet taken a position), business groups like the Chamber of Commerce, affordable housing developers, a slew of nonprofits that serve the homeless, bicycle activists, public transportation activists, urban boosters, the L.A. County Democratic Party and the Republic Party of L.A. County, and the Los Angeles Times editorial board ( see the full list here ). \nAnother Measure S opponent is Larry Gross, who heads the Coalition for Economic Survival and who helped write the city's rent stabilization ordinance. \n\"The fact is that Measure S doesn’t stop evictions, doesn’t guarantee an end to the destruction of rent-controlled housing and doesn’t prevent mansionizaton,\" Gross says. \nTwo Competing Visions of Los Angeles \nFor the last couple of decades, Los Angeles has become more and more urbanized. There has been a move to build more public transit, to make more neighborhoods walkable and bikeable, and to make certain neighborhoods (Hollywood, Koreatown, downtown) that have access to public transit more densely populated. This has caused a backlash, from people — including Measure S supporters — who prefer the older vision of an L.A. built around the single-family home and the automobile. \nTwo of the biggest problems the city faces are traffic and the high price of buying or renting a home. Backers of Measure S say that large-scale development and density make both of these problems worse. Because newer apartment buildings tend to be expensive, they argue, their residents don't take public transit, and the new buildings displace older, more affordable buildings, exacerbating the housing crunch. \nOpponents of Measure S say the only way to save Angelenos from a lifetime of gridlock is to give them another option – public transit. And the only way to make public transit viable is to create density around transit stops. They also say that rental prices are expensive because demand is outstripping supply, and the only way to lower rents is to build more apartment buildings ; they say Measure S's moratorium on such development will make the housing crisis worse. \nIt is a debate the city has had before, and one it will continue to have. \n\"L.A. is like this gigantic city that’s always been ambivalent about that,\" says Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at CSU Los Angeles. \"You want the city to grow, but you don’t want to have congestion. And L.A. has really struggled with that, politically.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:23:44.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
