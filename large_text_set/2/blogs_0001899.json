The demand for elephant tusks , in particular, has led to the destruction of countless precious endangered lives. We’ve seen many stories educating us on the sad state many elephants face every day. There are also many uplifting stories about admirable individuals and organizations who are doing their best to combat poaching and save these magnificent creatures from extinction. \nOne of these fine organizations is The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT) in Nairobi, Kenya. As the video above shows us, young elephants are very much like young humans – playful, social, curious, and oh-so-adorable! \nDSWT has saved over 150 orphaned elephants and rhinos in the past four decades, providing them with nurturing foster care on an expansive natural preserve. Their leading program rescues orphans that are a result of poaching, but they also have a mobile vet clinic and extensive community outreach programs. These programs educate the public, especially school children, on the importance of conservation and the immeasurable value of elephants, rhinos, and other wildlife. Through school outreach and use of films, DSWT is able to inspire a new generation of conservationists, something this planet always needs more of. \nThe David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is always looking for caring sponsors who wish to donate to their cause. There are many ways you can help join them in their fight against poaching. Want to read more posts like this?
