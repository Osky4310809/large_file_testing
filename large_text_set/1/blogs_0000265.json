Robert L. Cunningham\nThat time of year has come again, the time to engage in the rituals of marking the end of one year, and ushering in a new one. It's time to make new resolutions to change things about ourselves that we are less fond of, and time to reaffirm the things that have positively changed in our lives over the last year.\nBut as many Americans gather their families to watch the festivities in Times Square, either in person, or on the television, many other Americans, halfway around the world, gather with their families of a different kind — their brothers and sisters in arms.\nNow over 15 years since the US and NATO forces first entered Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, coalition forces continue to face challenges as the Taliban now controls 10% of the country with an additional 30% of the country currently being contested.\nAgainst this backdrop, these photos show what life is like for coalition soldiers based in Afghanistan as another year comes to an end.\nView As: One Page Slides A cake marking the New Year, made by the service members of Task Force Tiger, based at Bagram, Afghanistan, celebrating the joint accomplishments of the United States’ coalition work beside the 32nd Light Infantry Battalion from the country of Georgia. Task Force Tiger, 1st Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, from Fort Hood, Texas, is comprised of US Soldiers, Marines Airmen, Soldiers from Georgia and Czech Republic, and is partnered with the local Afghan security forces. Robert L. Cunningham Back in the US, the New Year is rung in with food, music, noise-makers and fireworks.\nFor our troops in Afghanistan, much of that is the same, except the fireworks here are mortars and rockets, and the noisemakers are loud speakers that shout things like: “IDF Impact. Take Cover. Don IBA if available. Continue to take cover. Sector security sweeps in progress.”\nIDF is military speak for indirect fire, referring to such weapons as mortars, rockets, and artillery; and IBA stands for individual body armor. The sounds of explosions and gunfire, followed by the loud speakers blasting their warnings come both during the day and at night.\nAfter an IDF attack, a Military Police vehicle conducts sector security sweeps. Robert L. Cunningham New Years in Afghanistan is not all doom and gloom, as the men and women serving in Afghanistan find time to make video calls to family members, hang around the smoke pit (an activity performed by those who smoke or vape, and those who do not alike), watch a movie on their tablet or a dvd, or, as in the case of this New Years Eve, catch some UFC fights on the American Forces Network, the military radio and television service.\nAirman from the 19th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron of the US Air Force based in Little Rock, Arkansas, watch the Cruz – Garbrandt UFC 207 fight. While deployed, Airman First Class Parks, 19, (foreground, left side), Senior Airman Cox, 22, Staff Sergeant Hauch, 26, Senior Airman Budd, 24 (left to right on the couch respectively), and Tech Sergeant Casswell, 36, (far right) are assigned to the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing, of the United States Air Forces Central Command. Robert L. Cunningham “We get to look forward to the Dining Facility’s special meals on holidays.” said Budd. “All we are trying to do here is maintain our sanity, and enjoy our family here.” continued Criswell.\n“We are all like a big family here. On Christmas, we had ugly sweaters and Santa hats. We do the best we can” Budd admitted. “It gives you a sense of normalcy- I am a movie guy, so getting to see a movie, things like that.” said Parks.\nWhen asked how the holidays are different than the other days here in Afghanistan, Tech Sergeant Caswell, quickly replied “When you are here, you work, you sleep, you get up, and you work, and then hit the bed. Your conversations are about work. On holidays, we relax; we get a few seconds to chat about other things.”\nWhen asked how they handle being away from family, the answer was quick. “We have two families, you see, there’s our family back home, then our family here.” Cox chimed in, before Budd interjected “When I go home, for about the first month, all I want to do is hang out with the guys I deployed with. Yes, I just spent every day for months with them, but I can talk openly with them.\n\"Sometimes it is hard to talk to civilians when I get home, cause I use an acronym here, everyone knows it. Back home, you have to explain them. I still have some great friends back home who are civilians, and I really want to enjoy their time, and stay positive. You have to remember the deployment, enjoy it, and then move on with life.”\nToday is not much different than any other day for the maintainers from the 19th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron. Their job today, is the same one as yesterday- keep the pilots and crew of the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing safely in the air, doing their job.\nA C-130 pilot, having just received his briefing on the mission and regional threats, inspects his C-130, prior to takeoff. Robert L. Cunningham The pilots plot their mission meticulously, checking and rechecking each section. As the aircraft is loaded with cargo, crew chiefs, flight engineers, loadmasters, and cargo lift operators go about their business.\nThe only indication onboard the C-130 that today was a holiday came in the form of a miniature festive hat that Staff Sergeant John Pittman was casually wearing over his ball-cap, totally ignoring that he was wearing it, and going stoically about his business. Robert L. Cunningham Master Sergeant “Papa” Rose pauses for some reflections on deployments, in the back of a C-130 transport aircraft. Robert L. Cunningham “I’m like their dad, having been in for 25 years. This is my 8th deployment.” Master Sergeant “Papa” Rose said of his team of aircraft maintainers. “There are the people who handle people problems. I handle the airplane problems…the guy behind the scenes. My team is really great. I don’t have to worry about them. They get it done.”\nSenior Airman Evan Williams, (21) of the 774th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, powers through a workout in an improvised gymnasium in a hanger. Robert L. Cunningham In their downtime, service members spend time reading, some spend time perusing education, and some find solace in regular trips to the gymnasiums. Some service members just fill their down time with more work. When working in a combat zone, holidays become suggestions, and the work continues.\nStaff Sergeant Boniface Yegon, 31, originally from Kenya, utilizes geospatial survey equipment to map an area for development into a motor pool. Robert L. Cunningham Major Donald Sulpizio, the executive officer for the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (The Big Red One), based at Fort Riley, Kansas, performs his rotation to check in on the progress of the service members assigned to the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade, on their various tasks. Robert L. Cunningham The leaders of the service members here are acutely aware of the heavy responsibility it is to lead troops in combat, to take these service members, away from their homes, and lives, to go fight in foreign lands.\nWhen reflecting on his time as a officer in the US Army, Major Donald Sulpizio, 35, said leadership comes down to three things: \"commitment, competence, and character.\"\nHe continued and said \"all I want to do is to deserve to lead these solders, these are parent's kids, they are husbands, wives, and parents themselves. It's not just about rank, you need to deserve to lead them in combat.\"\nIn the long shadows of an Afghan late afternoon, an AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopter stands ready to respond to any threat. Robert L. Cunningham As the last evening in 2016 comes to a close, security is an ever present concern. The enemy can’t help but send a few shots at the base, one last time for 2016. One of the most formidable deterrents to enemy action is the fleet of US air assets.\nAn AH-64E crew chief runs through the preflight checklist, making sure that the aircraft is combat ready, as the pilot and gunner get situated. Robert L. Cunningham When personnel on the base were alerted to enemy activity, some people ran to bunkers, others went to their aircraft. The AH-64E Apache helicopter QRF (Quick Reaction Force) took to the sky.\nThese professional aviators and warriors are skilled in the craft of close air support, or CAS. With a gunner in the front seat, and a pilot in the rear, the AH-64E is a lethal force multiplier. Whether a routine patrol, a maintenance flight, or a QRF mission, the dedicated service members who operate them enable others to do their job well.\nThe soldiers of the 32nd Light Infantry Battalion from the country of Georgia hosted a late evening New Years Ceremony with Task Force Tiger, commemorating the accomplishments of each unit’s soldiers. Robert L. Cunningham Mindful of the security risks in the region, including a devastatingly lethal attack in November, gatherings have been kept to a minimum. So, after careful planning and increased security measures, the men and women of the Georgian 32nd Light Infantry came together to celebrate the holidays.\nThe 32nd Light Infantry performs the Khorumi, a Georgian war dance, that describes, through motion, the path of a fight, from reconnaissance to when the Army arrives. Robert L. Cunningham The 32nd Light Infantry performs the Khridoli, a Georgian war fighting dance, that describes, through motion, the skills of a warrior against an unarmed, and then armed enemy. Robert L. Cunningham Senior Leadership from the US and Georgia, including US Major General John C. Thomson III, wrap up a fun evening of dancing, singing, and ringing in the New Year. Robert L.
