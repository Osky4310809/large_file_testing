The tax is now part of the US House Republican tax reform proposal.\nBiggs said Walmart is generally in favor of tax reform, but not when it involves taxing imports. It's estimated that more than 97% of all clothing and shoes sold in the US are imported.\nAs the world's largest clothing retailer, that poses a huge problem for Walmart.\nSTOCK PRICE FOR WMT Full price information The costs of Mexican imports would likely rise under the proposed tax. Walmart would either have to eat those costs and take a hit to profitability, or pass the costs onto customers. It seems like the latter option is more probable, according to Biggs' statements.\nBiggs made the comments on a call to discuss Walmart's fourth-quarter earnings .\nFor the quarter, revenue increased 1% to $130.9 billion and US same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, jumped 1.8%, marking the biggest quarterly increase in four years.\nNOW WATCH: A whiskey expert suggests some of his favorite bottles for under $50 \nSee Also: \nTrump's Labor Secretary pick withdrew after this explosive Oprah video of his ex-wife resurfaced Trump's fast-food CEO pick for labor secretary drops out after attacks from left and right A German grocery chain with the power to cripple Aldi, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's is about to invade America SEE ALSO: Chipotle is fixing one of its customers' top complaints ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:17:06.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
