Please forgive me, \" Shin told reporters at WYFF . \n\" They thought it meant minors, not minorities, ” Melonie Henderson, a server who has worked at the restaurant for two years, told reporters at WLOX . “ The thing about it is, there’s all kinds of minorities in here that work. Our owner, she’s Japanese. We have Spanish cooks.
