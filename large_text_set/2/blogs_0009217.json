GETTY The report said the British economy had “maintained momentum” since the Brexit vote \n“The economic evidence available since the EU referendum has demonstrated that the British economy is doing extremely well. “And this is before the huge benefits of Brexit are implemented.” \nThe Commission went on to claim that the impact of the referendum outcome “had yet to be felt” in full. And its forecast warned that the UK economy could slow down in 2018. \nGDP growth of 1.6 per cent was predicted across the rest of the EU for 2017, up from 1.5 per cent in last autumn’s forecast. \nThe Commission claimed the UK economy would slow to 1.2 per cent next year, with 1.8 per cent growth expected across the EU. \nIts Winter Forecast said: “The impact on growth of the vote by the UK to leave the EU has yet to be felt. “The economy has maintained momentum since the referendum.” \nThe Economic Forecast named Brexit as one of a series of factors creating an “extraordinarily high level” of economic uncertainty. Other factors included the forthcoming elections in key EU states, including France, the possibility of protectionist trade policies in the US under Donald Trump and a worldwide “mounting backlash against globalisation”. GETTY John Redwood welcomed the ‘more balanced’ forecast from the EU \nThe Commission warned of falling business investment and rising inflation in the UK, coupled with weak growth in disposable incomes and household consumption. But it also said our exports will grow, thanks to the decline in sterling’s value since the Brexit vote. \nHealthy growth figures have largely been driven by consumers cutting back on saving in order to spend more, the report said. \nBut consumption is expected to be scaled back as wages fail to keep pace with inflation – expected to hit 2.5 per cent in 2017 and 2.6 per cent in 2018. \nAnd the report warned of falling business investment due to “rising uncertainty”.
