They are Luke Sorboro (third, 160), Dalton Leightner (fourth, 120), Ryan Boyle (fourth, 220), Niko Chilson (fifth, 126), Brad Trescott (sixth, 132) and Chris Langguth (sixth, 170). They each helped Rootstown place fourth as a team in Division III with 73 points. \n“I’ll tell you what, this is the best experience of my life,” said Leightner, who lost to Casstown Miami East’s Graham Shore by major decision, 9-1, in the third-place match. “Its fun coming down here and winning, but it’s even more fun coming down here and winning with your team. Just seeing my teammates succeeding while I’m succeeding too down here is an amazing feeling.” \nSorboro, a senior wrestling at West Virginia next season, beat West Jefferson’s Josh Doherty, 8-6, to match his third-place finish from last season. He was Rootstown’s highest placer as a result. \n“It’s been a rough year for myself, but my coaches told me to keep on pushing,” said Sorboro, who was ranked third in his weight class by IntermatWrestle.com’s Josh Lowe. “Third wasn’t what I wanted, but third-place is better than anything else this morning. \n‘It’s incredible to be a part of a team that, for the first time in school history, brought six down and placed six. We’d rather be higher than fourth, but we’re excited about it.” \nBoyle lost to Barnesville’s Caide Bunfill, 4-2, in his third-place match. \nChilson joined Sorboro as final match winners for Rootstown, defeating Ruger Goeltzenleuchter of Haviland Wayne Trace by default. \n“We fed of each other,” said Leightner, who placed seventh last season. “When you see your teammates out there kicking butt, you want to get out there and kick some butt, too. As a senior, to leave as a part of that team success is great and I’m looking forward to see what our young guys do to keep this going.” \nHow they stand \nMechanicsburg hasn’t quite locked up the Division III team title yet, but it is close with 104.5 points. Oak Harbor is second with 87, while Genoa sits in third with 80. \nEdison sits in fifth with 67 points, but has one finalist and could catch Rootstown if Brady Barnett wins with a pin. \nRELATED : See full results in Division III . \nMatch of the day \nGarrettsville Garfield junior Logan Kissell became a three-time state placer and a third-place finisher for the first time in his career when he defeated Massillon Tuslaw’s Isaac Elliott, 7-2, at 132. \nKissell won four straight matches after dropping a 4-1 decision to state finalist Alex Isbrandt of Casstown Miami East on Friday morning. \n“It feels pretty good, but not as good as taking first,” Kissell said. “But I’ll take it. I’ve got one more year. He had a lot of good shots, but he just couldn’t finish. Anytime he’d shoot, I’d fight it off and go on the attack. I think I eventually just wore him down.” \nWho stood out \nSorboro, Rootstown (160): Sorboro won a thrilling 8-6 third-place match over West Jefferson’s Josh Doherty. Doherty was ranked second in his weight class, while Sorboro was ranked third at 152. \nKade Marker, Newbury (285): Marker, ranked ninth in his weight class, pinned Mogadore’s Paul Skye in 2:04 to place seventh. Marker was one of two state qualifiers for Newbury, but was the only one to place. Skye was ranked fourth in his weight class. \nDan Gilles is a freelance sportswriter from Lorain.
