(Source: Reuters) \nAs a part of probably pro-Turkey propaganda, thousands of Twitter accounts were compromised on Wednesday. The hackers took over many verified and high profile accounts and posted messages in the Turkish language followed by hashtags like #Nazialmanya and #Nazihollanda (#NaziGermany and #NaziHolland). These tweets also had swastika symbols in them. The tweets are reportedly related to a date, April 16. On that day Turkey is scheduled to hold a referendum on changes to the constitution to consolidate President Erdogan’s power and that could allow him to stay in the office till 2029. Some of the tweets also contain links to pro-Erdogan videos on YouTube. Some of the pictures that were posted, were replaced with the Turkish flag. \nSeveral media reports are speculating that the hacking came following the tensions between Netherlands and Turkey when the Dutch government stopped two Turkish ministers from talking to expatriated in the Netherlands before the referendum, Erdogan had then accused the Dutch of acting like ‘Nazi remnants and then suspended some diplomatic relations with the former country. He even accused Germany of behaving like ‘Nazis’, where Turkish rallies were banned before the referendum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T13:24:10.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
