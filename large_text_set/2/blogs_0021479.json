Ted Cruz dropped great news that border crossings at the Rio Grande had dropped 50%. \nNow today, authorities are confirming that border crossings are indeed decreasing. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-0'); }); \nFrom Conservative Tribune: googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-0'); }); \nTrump has indeed followed through on that promise, and it looks like it is working. KRGV reported that in Texas, Hidalgo County deputies have noted a decrease in the number of border crossings. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-1'); }); \nDeputy constable Joel Contreras explained that since the end of January, the number of border crossings as decreased immensely, though he said that won’t decrease border patrols. \nWhile it is difficult to track it directly to Trump taking office and it’s possible they may be finding other ways in, it’s terrific that the observable crossings are dropping in Hidalgo and the Rio Grande area. \nIt may be because of the clearer focus on immigration enforcement brought by the Trump team. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nIt may also be that because illegal aliens know the law is finally going to be enforced that they are simply not going to take the risk anymore. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:16:53.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
