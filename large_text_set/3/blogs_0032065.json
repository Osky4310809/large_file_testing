I'm always so happy to just throw myself in there and if you get hit or bruised or anything, I never really care about that but with this one, it wasn't just me I was reaching out for so we broke the fight down very slowly,\" she explained. \"We did it piece by piece and I just tried my best not to fall.\" \nMission accomplished!
