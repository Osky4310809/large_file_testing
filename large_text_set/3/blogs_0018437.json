After all, there's no better way to follow up a hard day of fighting crime than having a few slices of 'za with the gang in the sewer. Eating that much cheese and dough comes with a deep wisdom of what makes a good pie, and the reptilian heroes are now passing that knowledge on with The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Pizza Cookbook . Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo all weigh in on their favorite toppings, from classic New York pepperoni to deep dish goulash pizza. \nThe hardcover book comes with 65 radical recipesâ€”and yes, they're all pizza-related. The turtles are busy fighting crimes, so the cookbook was written by Peggy Paul Casella from ThursdayNightPizza.com . \nYou can pre-order this righteous tome on Amazon , which is set to come out in May.
