Currently, the city is enforcing temporary driving restrictions should smog levels reach harmful peaks, and had previously banned car with license plate ending with an even number from entering the centre. \nMore recently, Madrid blocked personal cars from the Gran Vía for nine days in December around the holiday shopping period.
