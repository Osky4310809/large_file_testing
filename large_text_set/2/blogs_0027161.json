If any justice agreed to retire, Trump would nominate former President Barack Obama’s nominee Garland to take their place. The Senate would then simultaneously confirm both Gorsuch and Garland\nObama nominated Garland in 2016 after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, but Senate Republicans would not hold a hearing for him. \nThe plan is nearly identical to the one proposed in a Season 5 episode of The West Wing . In that episode, the Chief Justice resigns from the court so President Bartlett can simultaneously put a liberal judge on the Court and give Republicans an open slot to fill with someone more conservative.\nUdall’s office said the idea didn’t come from The West Wing , as he rarely watched the show, but was rooted in Justice Arthur Goldberg’s resignation from the Supreme Court in 1965. He began thinking of the idea when a constituent asked him why the Senate couldn’t confirm both Gorsuch and Garland.\nUdall presented the plan to a group that included Gorsuch himself, according to CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:34:20.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
