I was not yet accustomed to advocating for myself, and I worried that I would be asking for too much, too soon. Instead, I used the restroom in the nurse’s office.” \nAfter receiving his principal’s permission to begin using a men’s bathroom closer to his classroom, Grimm was surprised when, one day, “the school board held a meeting — a public conversation about my genitals and restroom usage — without notifying me first.” \nHis gender, and body, were about to become the talk of the town. And though, Grimm explained, his family and friends stood by him during the meeting, and at others after that, he was ultimately told to stay out of the men’s bathroom. “My school board had invalidated me in perhaps the most humiliating way possible,” Grimm wrote. \nNevertheless, Grimm has taken his fight to the steps of the highest court in the land. And though they have ultimately decided to bump his case back down to the lower courts, he is clearheaded about the fight ahead , and what it means—not only for him, but for the larger transgender community , as well: Two years later — two crazy, stressful, busy, breathtaking, rewarding, beautiful, fantastic years later — I stand stronger and prouder than ever. I stand not only with my family and friends, but with millions of supporters who stand with me. I stand with so many wonderful people at the A.C.L.U. that I proudly call my family. I know now what I did not know then; I will be fine. Regardless of what obstacles come before me, regardless of what hatred or ignorance or discrimination I face, I will be fine, because I have love on my side. \n“This case will not be resolved until after I graduate,” Grimm admitted. “But this fight is bigger than me.” \nYou can read Gavin’s full stirring essay here .
