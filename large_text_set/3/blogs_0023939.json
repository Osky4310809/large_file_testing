Credit Maricopa County Sheriff's office The story that Wendy Lavarnia told the police on Monday was horrifying: Her 2-year-old son had grabbed a loaded 9-millimeter handgun off a bed while her back was turned, pointed it at his 9-year-old brother and pulled the trigger. That is how her son Landen was shot in the head, she said. At home alone with her four children, she called the police right away. But the police now say that questions abound about the fatal shooting — including who shot the boy and whether it was an accident. On Tuesday, Ms. Lavarnia, 28, and her husband, Kansas Lavarnia, 31, were charged with first-degree murder in Arizona in connection with Landen’s death, the police announced Wednesday. He died at a Phoenix hospital on Tuesday afternoon, a day after he was shot. The charges against Landen’s parents, the police said, are based on the great lengths the authorities believe the Lavarnias took to clean up the scene of the shooting — including the trunk of Mr. Lavarnia’s vehicle — before seeking help. Sgt. Vincent C. Lewis of the Phoenix Police Department told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday that the parents’ extensive destruction of evidence had delayed critical and potentially lifesaving care. “Significant efforts were made to scrub the house clean and remove evidence while this young boy lay shot and dying,” Jeri L. Williams, the department’s chief, said at the news conference. “This investigation will continue while justice is brought about.” Sergeant Lewis said the authorities were still investigating who pulled the trigger on the gun that killed Landen, as well as how much time his parents allowed to pass before they called 911. They are also investigating what role, if any, the 2-year-old may have played. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Had Mrs. Lavarnia changed what she had told the police on Monday? “I am not aware of that,” Sergeant Lewis said. He was among the officers who responded to the scene on Monday, and said that Mrs. Lavarnia had been “stoic” as she described the shooting of her oldest child. The role of Mr. Lavarnia was still unclear Wednesday. His wife said that he was not home during the shooting, and Sergeant Lewis said that Mr. Lavarnia arrived at the house three hours after police officers began their investigation.
