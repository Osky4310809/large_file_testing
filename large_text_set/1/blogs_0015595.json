Press Banned From Trump Hotel During Inauguration Week \nAccording to the Daily Mail , Puopolo once gave $20,000 to the Democratic National Committee and that he sat near former Secretary of State Clinton during the funeral of his mother, Sonia. \nPuopolo’s mother was a socialite and frequently mingled with the political elite. However, she was among 92 people on American Airlines Flight 11 on Sept. 11, 2001, when it crashed into the World Trade Center’s north tower in New York City. She was just two seats away from terrorist Mohammad Atta.   \nThe family has been known to give generously towards the Democratic party, and Puopolo has previously given to the likes of John Kerry and deceased Sen. Ted Kennedy. \nCurrently, the the fifty-one-year old goes by the Twitter handle of JesusChrist1701. \nIn a series of rambling videos on his account, Puopolo asks House Speaker Paul Ryan to fix an issue with the countries “park rangers.” HELP SOMEONE TALK TO CITY OF MIAMI BEACH PARK RANGERS TODAY NO MORE LIES AND DELAYS PER ORDER & COMMAND LORD & SAVIOR JESUS DOMINIC PUOPOLO pic.twitter.com/Ijk05w85RK \n— LORD JESUS CHRIST (@jesuschrist1701) December 13, 2016  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T17:59:06.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
