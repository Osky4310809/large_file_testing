Michael Rotenberg of 3 Arts Entertainment and Troy Miller will also executive produce. \nThe series will explore how Lopez struggles to fit in different milieu: the working-class Latino sphere from which he came and the celebrity lifestyle which he currently embraces. \n“We are excited to produce a series around iconic comedian George Lopez that reveals him in a hilarious, yet brutally honest way” says Keith Cox, executive vice president of development and original programming at TV Land, in a statement. “I’m excited that TV Land realizes that my personal challenges, insecurities and inability to connect are all part of my charm,” Lopez said. The comedian’s “George Lopez” has performed consistently while airing on TV Land’s sister outlet Nick at Nite. Lopez has also served as a talk-show host on Time Warner’s TBS and had a sitcom called “Saint George” run for a season on 21st Century Fox’s FX.
