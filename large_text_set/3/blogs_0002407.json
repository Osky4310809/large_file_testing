So, it’s no surprise that the company is planning new models for 2017. Rick Osterloh, Senior Vice President of hardware at Google, has confirmed that a “premium” Pixel 2 series is coming this year.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it,” Osterloh said during a press meeting at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week. “You can count on a [Google Pixel] successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” It’s likely the device will arrive later this fall as the original Pixel celebrates its first birthday.\nRecent reports have suggested Google could be planning a more affordable Pixel handset with budget-conscious consumers in mind. However, Osterloh appeared to dismiss this suggestion, promising the Pixel lineup would “stay premium.” The Pixel and Pixel XL have received heaps of praise for their high-end design and top-of-the-line specifications.\nAccording to certain speculation, the second-generation Pixel could bring an improved processor and an even greater camera. Fans may also get a water-resistant design as Google looks to keep up with rivals like the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy series, though there have been suggestions we’ll have to pay slightly more (possibly around $50) for it.\nGoogle could still be planning a more affordable alternative to the Pixel, of course — but it could be available under a different name. Alternatively, it could follow in Apple’s footsteps by selling the original Pixel alongside the Pixel 2 at a more affordable price tag.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T15:02:46.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
