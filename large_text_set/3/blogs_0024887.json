A team of scientists in Costa Rica found out that our endangered species of sea turtles have plastic straws blocking their airway. Plastic straws are one such single-use item ending up in our oceans by hundreds and thousands. Plastic can never be biodegradable that is why it is crucial for our oceans and the ecosystem there if we don't put an action to stop the use of plastic straws. We need your help to eradicate the use of plastic straws.Please sign this petition and join us in saving our sea turtles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:01:57.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
