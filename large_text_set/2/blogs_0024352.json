Immigrants and refugees make this country great. And turning away refugees, like we did to Anne Frank, does not make us great. Refugees are welcome here, Muslims are welcome here and immigrants are welcome here. And it's not just our ancestors. Every American knows an immigrant or a refugee. We wanted to send a reminder about America when we're at our best -- the country that's a beacon of freedom to the world, built by immigrants. Walling off countries or entire religions is against our values. That's what the Statue of Liberty stands for.\" The act is illegal, as hanging anything off the landmark is strictly prohibited, but that didn’t keep like-minded tourists from snapping selfies that prominently displayed a sentiment near to their hearts. Shortly after the banner was hung it was removed by Park Rangers who oversee the attraction. \n\n\nAuthorities have stated that an investigation is underway to ascertain the identities of those behind the act. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:39:45.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
