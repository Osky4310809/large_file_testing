[And I said], 'I mean, Carrie was there holding my hand when I took my first steps. I have film of that and it will be in the memorial.' And when I was editing that, it ripped my heart out. But my mother said, 'I know that's tough. It might be tougher even, you know… I don't know for sure when I [will] go.'\" \nInitially, Todd didn't understand what Debbie meant by these statements. \n\"I was like, 'Well, look, fortunately we don't have to face that right now, you know, we just face this'… But then she was like asking my permission [to go]. I [said], 'You're going to be OK, everything is under control.' And she starts running me back through her estate, which we had done many times. [She's like], 'You're going to take my dog and, you know, all these little instructions.' And [she] even [went through] last-minute changes due to the fact that Carrie left first, as far as the memorial service.\"' \nWhile Billie Lourd 's uncle thought he was going over logistics for Carrie's funeral, he realized he would soon be planning his mother's memorial service as well. \n\"I thought that we were just going through these events just like one would go back through an estate… But instead the next morning, we had a little further dialogue and she chose to leave the planet in front of my face two feet away. If you had told me this story and I wasn't there, I would have a very hard time believing what I saw. But she literally looked at me and said, 'I want to go be with Carrie' and closed her eyes and went to sleep.\"' \nAlthough one might have a hard time believing Todd's story, he says he is 100% telling the truth. \n\"I'm telling you what it looked like… It looked like she asked permission to leave, told me she was going to leave, told me she loves me, closed her eyes and went to sleep.\" \nR.I.P. Debbie and Carrie.
