We are not aware of the reported advance movements. The last time the President spoke about this, he said he would return to his doctors after some time. We are not aware that this has changed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T09:37:50.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
