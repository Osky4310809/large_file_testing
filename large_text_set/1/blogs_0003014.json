Even as she huddled with her friends to the edge of the dance floor at The Vault, she kept glancing at the giant TV screen. It was about to telecast Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s year-end speech. With every passing minute, Tanya was turning anxious.\n“On November 8, I had missed the speech and ended up queuing up at an ATM around midnight. This time I wanted to make sure that I didn’t miss any announcement. It was quite drastic last time as people barely had a scope to withdraw enough money to sustain for the next couple of days,“ she said. Tanya, a first year student of humanities, feels that people could have been spared the hardships they faced in the last 50 days. “There were many who were left with very little cash the next morning. Scenes of long queues in front of ATMs have become familiar,“ she said.\nTanya’s friend Raya, a student of political science, feels that the drastic step was needed to catch the bull by its horn. “Had he (Modi) given more time it could have turned counterproductive. Fraudsters would have got more time to turn their undeclared cash into some other formats,“ she felt. While she thinks that it is not possible to get rid of black money overnight, a large part can be sucked out of the sy stem. “Modi wants to address an issue that is a constant threat to the economy. When we are taking such an issue head on, some hardships are unavoidable,“ Raya said.\nRevellers listen to the Prime Minister’s speech at a city pub on Saturday night.\nSaikat Das, a private bank employee and a resident of north Kolkata, feels that troubles would start easing out as more liquidity is pushed into the economy. “Since the withdrawal limit has been increased to Rs 4,500 from January 1, we expect some respite. For the common man, the weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 24,000 is good enough. When it comes to business, the limit needs to be increased,“ he said as he watched the scrolls on the television, highlighting the major points of PM Modi’s speech.\nSuman Adhikari, an employee with a south Kolkata nursing home, has seen enough suffering of patients due to withdrawal limits set following the demonetisation announcement. “It was more difficult for the patients who have come from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh. They had money but there was no way they could exchange the entire amount,“ he said.\nEngineering student Prantik Saha also felt that initial days were dreadful for those who had come from outside. A resident of Siliguri, Prantik studies civil engineering at an institute in Kolkata. “We coped with the new normal after November 8. We will do so after the fresh guidelines come in,“ he said before hitting the dance floor at a city pub.\nTNN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T07:10:37.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
