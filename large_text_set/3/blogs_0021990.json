They want to encourage more players. That’s us and others too,” he said. \nThe group will undertake the business through a company called Streamtech Systems Technologies Inc., which is seeking a congressional franchise to operate telecom service. \nIn line with this, a bill was filed last year seeking to allow Streamtech to “construct, install, establish, operate and maintain telecommunications systems in the Philippines for commercial purposes and in the public interest.” \nVillar, who is CEO of Vista Land, said the priority was to provide internet services to their housing communities, spanning 100 cities and municipalities across 37 provinces. He said their telecommunications service would likely be profitable. \nVista Land said it was continuing to expand nationwide. \n“We’ve been planning it for a while, our buyers want good internet service,” Villar said. \nHe said they could provide “last mile” internet links to their existing communities within two years. That means Vista Land would still have to rely on the telecom backbone of incumbent players. \nThat could change if the government proceeds with its P78-billion national broadband network plan, a hybrid “infostructure” project that allows telcos to lease state-owned assets to provide last mile connections to far flung areas. \n“If the government creates a backbone that to accessible by third-party players, that will be a game changer,” Villar said. “If there is a backbone that is competitive, you will see the price of internet go down a lot.” \nA key challenge for a budding telecom player, especially one that plans to also build a nationwide mobile network, was the massive cost involved. \nSean Gowran, Ericsson country head and president of Philippines and Pacific Islands, said that for a new full-service player to catch up, capital spending would be about $10 billion over five years, with break-even seen in 25 to 30 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:27:56.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
