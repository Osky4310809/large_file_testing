Malia Obama spotted at her summer internship, on set for HBO's \"Girls.\" She also celebrated her 17th birthday yeste… pic.twitter.com/EVbt7LKt1Z \nAs was always expected, Malia is more than just America’s Coolest Teen. \nAccording to Dunham, she’s also America’s Smartest Teen. \nGiven that her dad, Barack , is a huge nerd , and her mother, Michelle , is a two-time Ivy League grad, this does not come as much of a surprise. \nDunham said, \nShe is so smart. I once asked her, ‘What’s your favorite movie?’ \nShe was like, ‘Do you want me to list it by favorite director, writer, or cinematographer?’ \nI was like, ‘You’re smarter than me, let’s just be done with this topic.’ \nWhich might say more about Dunham’s expectations for the teen than the teen herself, but whatever. Lena Dunham at attends the Girls season six premiere   \nDunham explained that Malia ended up working on the show because of the HBO internship. \nShe also talked about what Malia did on set. She said, \nObviously, we weren’t making her go get our coffee. \nBut she wanted to do all the jobs, that was the cool thing. She was totally enthusiastic. \nThis fits in with what local guides said about Malia’s educational trip to Bolivia last year, where they said she did all the chores, same as anyone else. \nDunham went on to say, \nShe’s done such a good job, and clearly her parents have done such a good job. \nWhen you see that family together, they’re not performative. \nWhich, really, we could all see over the past decade. \nMalia has a clear interest in the entertainment industry. Outside of the “Girls” HBO internship, she’s now interning with major producer Harvey Weinstein, the genius behind many Oscar campaigns.

Then Malia’s off to Harvard in the fall. \nThe last season of “Girls” (NO!) begins this weekend. \nGet your tissues and liberalism ready. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:41:35.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
