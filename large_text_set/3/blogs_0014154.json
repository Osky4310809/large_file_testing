The Pioneers (28-7-4) had previously been shut out only once, in a 3-0 loss (two empty-net goals) on Jan. 13 at Western Michigan — their opponent Saturday afternoon in the NCHC third-place game. \nDenver remains No. 1 in the PairWise Rankings but could slip to No. 2 if it loses to Western Michigan and Minnesota-Duluth defeats North Dakota. The No. 1 overall national seed will likely open against the Western Collegiate Hockey Association champion, Bowling Green or Michigan Tech. The No. 2 overall seed will probably open against the Atlantic Hockey champion, which could be dangerous Air Force. \n“This will be good for us,” DU goalie Tanner Jaillet said of the loss. “I think we needed this, to be honest. We didn’t play very good at all and it’s the first time we’ve played a good team in a while. Hopefully we can learn from this and get ready for tomorrow.” \nPoganski scored 2:30 into the third period off a big carom off the end boards. From the left point, defenseman Colton Poolman put the long shot off the boards behind the net and Poganski drove in from the right wing and had the open net to shoot at because Jaillet wasn’t expecting the carom. \n“I went forward with my blocker and missed,” Jaillet said of Poolman’s shot. “Kid got a heckuva bounce; it went right on his stick. Rinks like this, bounces happen. What can you do?” \nDenver had an unfortunate stretch to end the second period. Sophomore Dylan Gambrell put a wrist shot off the crossbar; and the Pioneers were assessed a penalty to negate a semi-breakway. Senior Evan Janssen took a pass on the UND blue line but linemate Matt Marcinew was whistled for tripping behind the play.
