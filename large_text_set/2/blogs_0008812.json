I don’t care about her nudes or sexual history and no one should,” the 25-year-old Ratajkowski tweeted in two messages about her experience at a New York Fashion Week event Sunday night. \n“Gender specific attacks are disgusting sexist bullshit,” added Ratajkowski, who has publicly opposed President Trump ‘s policies on a number of issues, including abortion and immigration . \nShe’s absolutely right. \nGotta give her some props for standing up for what’s right even if it doesn’t jive with her personal politics. \nWish more people would do that.
