He watches a news report about Damien Darhk's death. Just then, Darhk and Eobard Thawne speed into the apartment, and promise they have a way to reverse Malcolm's fate. \nIn the present day, the Legion of Doom argue about their tactics to find the Spear of Destiny. Malcolm suggests using hypnosis to get Rip to cooperate. Darhk questions how they can get the Medallion from the Legends, but Thawne explains that the Legends aren't smart enough to keep it. \nIn the Waverider, the Legends also argue about their plans with the Medallion. Sara suggests the team use it as leverage, and they set a course for Central City, 2017. \nMalcolm returns to the Legion of Doom and reveals that his hypnosis didn't work on Rip because his past memories are gone. Eobard gets frustrated and speeds off. \nDarhk sharpens a pair of knives, preparing to torture Rip Hunter. Darhk monologues about feeling threatened by Thawne, and insists Rip cooperate to help Darhk restore his leverage in the Legion of Doom. He threatens to cut out one of Rip's eyes, and ultimately succeeds at pulling out his tooth. \nDarhk shows the tooth to the Legion of Doom, who discover markings on the tooth. The markings lead to a security box in Switzerland, which the team believes holds the rest of the Spear of Destiny. Thawne instructs Merlyn and Darhk to take the Time Sphere to where Rip last used the safe in 2025. \nIn 2017, Stein and Jax enter Jitters. They run into Lily, Stein's daughter. Stein explains that they need Lily's help with researching the medallion. Lily inspects it with a device, and accidentally causes it to project a map onto Jitters. Stein and Jax take Lily onto the Waverider. \nDarhk and Merlyn argue about their tactics for getting to Rip's safe. Darhk suggests killing everyone at the bank, while Merlyn believes they should be more subtle, and possibly use Rip in their plan. \nThe Legends argue about Stein showing Lily the Waverider. Sara believes doing so is going to only cause more abberations, but ultimately agrees to let Lily keep helping the team with the medallion. \nMerlyn dresses Rip in a suit and instructs him in his plan. They travel to 2025, Zurich, Switzerland. They give Rip a communication device and instruct him in how to open his safe. Darhk adds that if Rip doesn't follow their instruction, he will die. \nWhile Rip asks for the box, Darhk and Merlyn discuss Thawne's involvement in the group. They question why he is using the two of them, and decide to prove to him that they are equals. \nThe Legends review photos of all of their known speedsters. They try to determine why the speedster wants the Spear of Destiny, and what in reality he is trying to fix. \nRip is taken to the safe and needs to give a retnal scan, but fails. He then is asked to speak an access code, which is he does not remember. Merlyn and Darhk intervene, shooting down the bank teller. Darhk wants to kill Rip, but is preoccupied by security arriving on the scene. Merlyn and Darhk fight the guards while Rip hides. \nThe three casually leave the scene.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:31:45.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
