And now the Toy Battery operated Thar costs more than this! http://t.co/l33eK7XX9G \n— anand mahindra (@anandmahindra) March 14, 2017 \nAnand Mahindra is very active on Twitter. Recently he posted a puzzle on Twitter stating that “sometimes drivers give you the best lessons in life”. “Morning puzzle. How long does it take you to decipher this? These drivers sometimes give you the best lessons in life,” he tweeted. This is not the first time that he is posted such a thing on the micro-blogging site. Recently, Mahindra used the video of a Panda that went viral on social media platforms to teach how clinging to a business strategy that isn’t working for you, is a bad idea. In the video, a Panda is clinging onto a man who is busy with his own work. Even though the man continuously ignores the Panda, it keeps coming back. While most people saw the funny side of this video and shared it for fun, Mr Mahindra used it as a business lesson. He posted a tweet saying, “This went viral for cuteness. But also a business lesson: “Don’t cling to a strategy if it keeps throwing you off! ????” \nYou may also like to watch: \nSome of his tweets also show that he has got a brilliant sense of humour. In January he tweeted a picture of a Pininfarina Maserati Birdcage (2006) and wrote that that is one cage he doesn’t mind being imprisoned in. Well, not everyone is aware that the Mahindra Group had acquired Italian car design firm Pininfarina in December 2015. Someone who probably had no clue about the takeover tweeted why doesn’t Mahindra buy the car if he liked it so much. The business tycoon had a perfect response for user Siddhant Khanna. “We bought the company instead…(Pininfarina)” he tweeted with a smiley. \nComing back to the Jeep, agreed that in 1960, even Rs 12, 421 was too much but it does look like peanuts now!
