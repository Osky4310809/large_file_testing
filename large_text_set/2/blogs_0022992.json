As announced during the dealers’ dinner, Datuk Jeffrey Lim, general manager and director of KMM said the price of the naked sports Z650 would fall below the RM37,000 mark, and has delivered on the promise. \nThis would mean the full-fairing Ninja 650, with an estimated price of RM38,000, would not too far away from the Z650. With the 2017 Kawasaki Z650 ABS coming at RM35,000 and change, this makes this middleweight machine a touch more attractive, specifications wise, than its closest rival, the Yamaha MT-07 – sans ABS – at RM36,795. \nCarrying a 649 cc liquid-cooled, parallel-twin that puts out 67.3 hp at 8,000 rpm and 65.7 Nm of torque at 6,500 rpm, Bosch 9.1M ABS is standard for both the Z650 and Ninja 650. A welcome inclusion to the spec-sheet is an assist-and-slipper clutch, which prevents rear-wheel hop and chatter on hard down-shifts. \nAlso new for the 2017 Kawasaki Z650 is a monochrome LCD instrument cluster, and fuel is carried in a 15-litre tank. Wet weight is claimed to be 187 kg, and the seat height is a rider-friendly 790 mm. \nThe Z650 is Kawasaki’s successor to the best-selling Er-6n, which took the Malaysian market by storm with its affordability and ease of use. There are two-colour schemes available for the Z650 – Lime Green or Titanium – with availability in Kawasaki Authorised Premium Dealer showrooms at the end of February.
