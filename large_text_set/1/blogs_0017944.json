The two companies are already reportedly working together to launch the first two Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches , which may be officially revealed in early February.\nGoogle Assistant was first launched with the company’s own Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones in the fall of 2016, and it was also included with its Google Home connected speaker. The digital assistant is also supposed to be included in a number of upcoming smart TVs and set-top boxes , including the latest NVIDIA Shield Android TV box . It certainly makes sense for Google to want its AI system to expand to more Android smartphones, as it competes with others on the market, particularly Amazon’s Alexa.\nThe LG G6 is supposed to be officially announced on Sunday, February 26 as part of a press event at the 2017 Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, Spain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:42:23.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
