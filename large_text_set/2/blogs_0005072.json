Thatâ€™s a problem. \nHaving never seen an angel, you will always be in doubt: Perhaps the mentor you have chosen is not like an angel. How can you ever rely on your mentor while so unsure of his or her qualifications? \nSo we will clarify: The mentor must be a human angel. \nAn angel, because just as an angel has no body, no hatred, no jealousy, and is not in competition with you, so the mentor must remain objective and uninfluenced by any personal benefit from the advice. \nAnd yet a human being: With compassion, with a conscience, and with a passion for kind deeds.
