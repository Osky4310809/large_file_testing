Strike threat on Night Tube after just six months of service \nManuel Cortes, leader of TSSA, representing the officers, said: “Are they supposed to sleep at the station? No employer should turf their staff out at 1 am onto the streets of London with no way to get home. \n“But that’s exactly what the BTP, the very people charged with ensuring the public travel safety, are now doing to their own staff.” \nHe said requests for the majority of shifts to start earlier and finish at Midnight have been rejected. \nThe union boss called on Mayor Sadiq Kahn to intervene in the increasingly bitter dispute and “bang heads together if necessary. \n“He is the BTP paymaster when it comes to security on our Tube and I am sure he too will be as shocked as we are at the way this safety group of staff is being treated.” \nMr Cortes said the new clock-off time is being imposed from next month as part of a BTP cost-cutting exercise to reduce night shift allowance payments by five per cent – meaning PCSOs could lose around £1,000 a year. \nThe BTP employs 330 PCSOs, almost half in London stations, but, because they cannot afford London housing, London PCSOs depend on trains in and out of the home counties for the commute to work. \nThe union said the changes broke a 2014 agreement that night shifts should work in line with Tube and mainline train timetables. Under current arrangements staff do work some shifts up to 1 am but with the opportunity to change or swop shifts.
