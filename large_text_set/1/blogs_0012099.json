(William Perlman, The Star-Ledger) comments \nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- If you show Johnny Manziel the money, he'll give you an autograph or a selfie during Super Bowl week. \nManziel, the former Browns quarterback, will appear at two Houston-area malls to interact with fans for a fee on Feb. 2-3 in advance of the Super Bowl. The Crave Sports Company is billing the appearances, both at Stadium Signature stores, as Manziel's first two public autograph sessions. \nManziel will sign \"any item'' for $99, will take professional photos for $99 and will pose for selfies for $50. He'll also inscribe something (up to four words) along with the autograph for an additional $29. \nManziel will appear at Katy Mills Mall on Feb. 2 and Woodlands Mall on Feb. 3 from 7-8 p.m. \n\"There's been a lot of interest,'' said Jessie Cervantes, who helps run the Katy Mills store. \"I had a guy say he's coming all the way from Georgia just to get his picture taken with Johnny.'' \nCervantes said the phones haven't stopped ringing since the appearance was announced. Johnny Manziel signed a baby at an event in Cleveland in 2015. Mary Kay Cabot, cleveland.com \n\"We have a lot of signings, Astros, Texans and I don't think I've ever seen anything like this,'' he said. \"They're calling from all over -- California, New York.'' \nHe said he's hearing mostly from Texas A&M fans, but also from some Manziel critics. \n\"They either love him or hate him,'' said Cervantes. \nThe No. 22 overall pick in 2014, Manziel has been out of football since the Browns cut him March 11th. He was suspended the first four games of the season for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy, and reinstated in October. \nA domestic violence charge against Manziel was dropped in December by the Dallas County District Attorney's office as long as Manziel agreed to undergo counseling and have his behavior monitored for up to a year.
