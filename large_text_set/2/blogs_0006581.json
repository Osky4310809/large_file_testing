Last Updated: 09/02/17 4:56pm Marco Silva managed Olympiakos to victory at Arsenal Marco Silva masterminded Olympiakos' shock win at Arsenal just over a year ago. Ahead of Hull City's clash with the Gunners this weekend, we look at whether the Portuguese can pull off another upset at the Emiratesâ€¦ \n\"There are no rules to say the favourites must win all of the games.\" \nMarco Silva was undaunted by the task facing his Olympiakos team in September 2015. A 3-2 Champions League group stage win at Arsenal confirmed he was right to be bold about his men's chances before kick-off. \nOn Saturday, he'll be hoping his Hull City team can produce a similar surprise, live on Sky Sports . \nThe Portuguese was an unlikely appointment by the Tigers at the start of January. An unfamiliar name on these shores, despite cup success with Sporting Lisbon in his homeland, Silva was handed a short-term deal until the end of the season and the testing task of securing Premier League survival for the relegation favourites. \nAgainst the odds, the man who led Olympiakos to a record-breaking league win in Greece last season, has revived Hull's hopes of retaining their top flight status. \nA 2-1 win over Jose Mourinho's Manchester United was not enough to overturn a first-leg EFL Cup semi-final deficit, but a subsequent goalless draw at Old Trafford in the Premier League, coupled with wins over Bournemouth and - impressively - Liverpool have propelled Hull to within one point of safety. Watch highlights of Hull 2-0 Liverpool \nThey will aim to continue their run of good form at the Emirates live on Sky Sports this weekend - and, despite being big underdogs, Silva will have his sights set on another upset win over Arsene Wenger's side. \nOlympiakos' victory in north London in 2015 was a landmark moment for the Greek giants. Despite domestic dominance, they have rarely been able to match Europe's top teams but that result ended a 50-year losing streak in England. \nSo how did Silva pull it off? \nFirst there was the in-depth preparation. Ryan Mason is among the Hull players to have praised Silva's \"intense\" work on the training ground since he joined the club, while Curtis Davies says his new manager is \"meticulous in everything\". \nWith this attention to detail, Silva picked out Arsenal's strengths and weaknesses and how Olympiakos could deal with them. \"We have analysed the jobs which Arsenal do well and will try not to make mistakes and match what we have done in training,\" he said before the game. Olympiakos' average positions show how they stuck to Silva's 4-2-3-1 plan \nCapitalising on set-pieces was one target area. Olympiakos' opener came from a well-worked corner routine, which saw Esteban Cambiasso fire a low pass to the edge of the box where unmarked Felipe Pardo struck a low shot into the net off Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. \nIf there was a slice of fortune to that goal, there was a huge chunk of good luck for their second, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina spilling Cambiasso's in-swinging corner over his own goal-line. But the delivery of the kick was clearly intended to probe at Arsenal's insecurity from set-pieces. \nSilva's plans weren't simply reserved for attack, though. Hull players have been physically moved around the training pitch by their new manager in practice games as he drills home his tactical demands and a clear defensive structure was evident in Olympiakos' play at the Emirates, as they attempted to soak up pressure from the home side. Arsene Wenger and the Arsenal bench showed their concern during the defeat \nArsenal dominated possession throughout the contest. They had the ball for 70 per cent of the game and were camped in Olympiakos' half for much of it. Wenger was quick to point out afterwards his team should have scored more than the two goals they did, but Silva's well organised backline repeatedly blocked and battled the ball clear. \n\"Whichever team comes here to win needs to know how to suffer, to put up with the pressure, and I think that was one of the key features here,\" Silva said after the game. \n\"We ran a lot and resisted when Arsenal tried to tire us, we were very well organised defensively and had very quick responses to Arsenal's goals which was very important.\" Arsenal vs Hull City", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:13:03.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
