National Eye Institute, NIH ID: 10742613 In late 2013, the ICMS IRB reviewed the Florida trial, intended to test the ability of stem cells from fat to treat an eye disease called Age-Related Macular Degeneration , which slowly robs people of the sharp central vision they rely on to read and drive. By then, Centeno had parted ways with the organization. “I have not been involved with the ICMS in many years and have no part in the approval of this protocol, nor would I have approved it had I been part of the organization,” he told BuzzFeed News by email.\nThe ICMS IRB that reviewed the Florida clinical trial consisted mostly of doctors who themselves practice unproven stem cell therapies. Its chair was David Harshfield, who works at the Arkansas Institute of Regenerative Medicine in Little Rock, and who has trained other doctors to set up their own stem cell practices. A 2015 press release about a workshop in Puerto Rico says that he would “teach doctors how to use and successfully market” stem cell therapies.\nHarshfield did not respond to phone calls and emails from BuzzFeed News.\nThe IRB also included another Arkansas doctor, Jay Holland, who in 2009 pled guilty to violating federal law on medical privacy. Then at the St. Vincent Infirmary Medical Center in Little Rock, Holland watched a report about a local TV news reporter who had been found beaten and bloody in her bed. (She later died from her injuries.) Filled with curiosity, Holland illegally accessed the reporter’s medical records from his home computer. He was sentenced to one year’s probation, and fined $5,000.\nVideo available at: https://youtube.com/watch?v=yZ4pYCJNqk8 . In a promotional video, Jay Holland describes using blood plasma, stem cells, and lasers to treat chronic wounds. His collaborator, Carl Keller, is a “community member” of the ICMS IRB. youtube.com\nID: 10742040 Another member of the ICMS IRB was Dean Reeves, a doctor in Roeland Park, Kansas. In April 2012, his medical license was put on probation by the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts, which regulates doctors in the state, because of problems with his use of “prolotherapy” — an alternative medical practice in which doctors inject patients’ joints with fluid, which is supposed to promote healing. The board faulted him for issues including failing to properly use medical imaging to guide his injections, failing to combine the treatment with physical therapy, and failing to document important aspects of the procedures, including his use of sedation.\nBoth Holland and Reeves hung up when BuzzFeed News asked them about their troubled disciplinary histories. “We won’t continue this conversation. We need to say goodbye,” said Reeves — whose disciplinary difficulties continue to this day. In September 2016, Reeves wrote to the Kansas board, requesting that his probation be terminated. But in November, the board initiated fresh proceedings against him, alleging further departures from appropriate care in Reeve’s treatment of 15 patients.\n“It’s very easy to find physicians who do not have a troubled disciplinary history,” Leigh Turner, a bioethicist at the University of Minnesota who last year published a survey of clinics offering unproven stem-cell therapies, told BuzzFeed News. “These are individuals that undercut the integrity and credibility of the IRB.”\nTurner also argued that the ICMS has “obvious conflicts of interest” when acting as an independent ethical reviewer for stem-cell studies that have not been submitted to the FDA for approval, given its opposition to the agency’s regulatory role.\nID: 10742045 The ICMS and Kristin Comella, chief science officer for US Stem Cell, once had a professional relationship. In 2012, before her company submitted the macular degeneration trial for approval to the society’s IRB, she was a prominent speaker and one of the “ conference faculty ” at a scientific meeting in Florida organized by the ICMS.\nToday, things are rather different. Comella and Becker Public Relations, which represents US Stem Cell, did not respond to emails and phone calls from BuzzFeed News. But last week, Comella told the New York Times that an independent review board approved the plan to treat patients in both eyes at once.\nThat was flatly contradicted by the statement posted online by the ICMS, which stated: “Throughout the protocol, the treated eye is consistently referred to in the singular and the protocol does not contemplate, much less condone, bilateral treatment. If the protocol had mentioned bilateral treatments, it would not have received approval from the ICMS IRB.”\nOn one point, however, the ICMS and US Stem Cell are still on the same page: The trial, they both claim, never enrolled any patients.\nYet in repeated filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, most recently in its annual report for the year ending December 31, 2015 — more than two years after the original press release announcing the clinical trial — US Stem Quote: : “We have also initiated several Institutional Review Board studies in 2013 using adipose derived stem cells for various indications including dry macular degeneration.”\nA July 2016 court filing by Patsy Bade, after she had settled with US Stem Cell but before her settlement with Greenbaum, alleges that the trial did start enrolling patients. It indicates that Greenbaum was convinced by Comella — they met at the gym where Comella was an aerobics instructor, according to the court document — to become the trial’s lead researcher. Greenbaum was allegedly trained by Comella in how to harvest and use stem cells from fat, with the $7,500 cost being deferred in exchange for Greenbaum agreeing to work on the clinical trial.\nThe court filing indicates that Greenbaum treated “ approximately six ” patients as part of the clinical trial, before she started to have misgivings about its legitimacy.\nIn Spring 2015, according to the court filing, Greenbaum told Comella that she could no longer participate. But she allegedly still conducted an initial examination of the three women who were subsequently blinded, before Comella and a registered nurse conducted the procedure.\nGreenbaum has since settled with Bade, in an agreement that prevents all of the parties from discussing the case. She did not respond to calls and emails from BuzzFeed News.\nWhether or not the trial actually enrolled any patients, Turner argues that there is a serious problem.\n“The company seems to have made the determination that this was clinical research,” he said. “Why were the patients being treated if they weren’t being giving cells as part of study?”\nID: 10742052 5.\nThese Women Went Blind After A Florida Clinic Injected Fat Cells Into Their Eyeballs\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10742056 6.\nResearchers Mapped 570 Unproven Stem Cell Clinics In The US\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10742069", "external_links": ["https://img.youtube.com/vi/yZ4pYCJNqk8/2.jpg", "https://nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/health/eyes-stem-cells-injections.html?_r=0", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3520985-Reeves-Board-Order-April-2012.html", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stem-cell-therapy-networks-summer-workshops-help-physicians-build-regenerative-medicine-practices-300072114.html", "http://www.cellmedicinesociety.org/conference/info", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ4pYCJNqk8", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3520986-Reeves-Board-Petition-November-2016.html", "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1388319/000118518516003859/usstemcell10k123115.htm", "https://web.archive.org/web/20131027050612/http://www.cellmedicinesociety.org/physicians/irb", "https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/littlerock/press-releases/2009/lr072009.htm", "http://www.cellmedicinesociety.org/conference/faculty", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3520987-Reeves-Request-to-Terminate-September-2016.html", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3521153-Bade-Amended-Complaint.html", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3521153-Bade-Amended-Complaint.html#document/p5/a345068", "https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/littlerock/press-releases/2009/lr102609.htm"], "published": "2017-03-22T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:53:12.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
