Here we examine how Joan of Arc, and music in general, was a salvation for Kinsella, following a childhood punctuated by bullying and abuse. We speak extensively with his family and friends, not to mention members of the band both past and present, mapping Kinsella's road from Cap'n Jazz through to Joan of Arc's origins. With a new sound largely divorced from Cap'n Jazz's legacy, the documentary explores how the desire to create art fueled the band's ongoing twenty-year run, even in the face of visceral reaction from critics. The film chronicles the band's ups-and-downs and constant reinvention that continues to this day. Listen to all the songs in the film here below and watch the doc above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T22:33:07.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
