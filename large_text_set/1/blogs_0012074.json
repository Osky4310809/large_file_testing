Search Rotten Tomatoes? Nope. Hop on IMDB? Nope. Check out reviews on Metacritic? Nope. You see if anyone had a heart attack, puked or fainted during screenings of the movie. Based on the reactions by some people who already saw the upcoming cannibal film Raw , it will be well worth your time and money. \nAcclaimed French director Julia Ducournau hopes to scare the fuck out of you with his latest effort that has plenty of piss-your-pants elements. \nCarrie -like blood baths? – Check\nCannibalism? – Check\nAnimal torture? – Check\nVampire-like sex? – Check\nSkin-peeling diseases? – Check\nEnraged vegans? – Check\nRaw won the FIPRESCI Prize at Cannes last year. It also won an award at the Toronto film festival: “Movie to Cause Most People to Faint.” Paramedics had to be called to the theaters because the “film became too much for a couple patrons.”\nAlso. People may have passed out and/or vomited from how intense Raw was. What a movie. #TIFF16 @mmadnesstiff \n— Dave Baldwin (@davemabaldwin) September 13, 2016 \n\nHere’s the official synopsis for Raw :\nEveryone in Justine’s family is a vet. And a vegetarian. At 16, she’s a brilliant and promising student. When she starts at veterinary school, she enters a decadent, merciless and dangerously seductive world. During the first week of hazing rituals, desperate to fit in whatever the cost, she strays from her family’s principles when she eats raw meat for the first time.\nJustine will soon face the terrible and unexpected consequences of her actions as her true self begins to emerge…\nI’ve seen the rage of vegans faced to eat at a restaurant with no vegetarian options, so I can imagine the fury of a vegan forced to eat raw rabbit liver. Frightening stuff. \nRaw storms into theaters on March 10 and you might be smart to sit in the last row. \nAlso, avoid chicks with nosebleeds, they tend to be trouble.
