JUST WATCHED School officials speak out on rape incident 01:07 Story highlights Father of teenager suspected of rape at a high school was arrested by ICE His son's case caught attention of the White House (CNN) The father of a high school rape suspect was arrested on Friday after it was discovered he was in the United States unlawfully, according to a statement from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Adolfo Sanchez-Reyes, a 43-year-old from Guatemala, is detained in Jessup, Maryland, and has been ordered to appear in immigration court, said Matthew Bourke, a spokesman for ICE. He was arrested \"after a review of his immigration history revealed he was unlawfully present in the United States,\" Bourke told CNN. Sanchez-Reyes is the father of Henry Sanchez-Milian -- who ICE says is also an undocumented immigrant -- the family's attorney Andrew Jezic said. His 18-year-old son is accused of raping a schoolmate on March 16 along with another student in a Rockville High School bathroom. He and 17-year-old classmate, Jose Montano are being charged as adults with first-degree rape and two counts each of committing a first-degree sexual offense, according to Montgomery County Police. Why controversy over undocumented teen rape suspect is moot Read More Jezic had told CNN earlier this month that Sanchez-Milian will plead not guilty because \"this was a pre-planned, consensual and non-forcible encounter.\" He said he believes his client will be acquitted in a jury trial and plans to claim asylum for Sanchez-Milian following the criminal proceedings. Following Sanchez-Milian's arrest, ICE issued an immigration detainer, an order to local law enforcement to hold a suspect for a pending immigration review. The rape case caught the attention of the White House, coming at a time of heightened scrutiny of undocumented immigrants.
