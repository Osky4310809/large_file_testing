Getty Images 3 Pepe is deciding whether to quit Real Madrid for the Chinese Super League \nAnd while real stall on offering him a new deal as they look to bring through new players, Pepe has been the subject of approaches from two clubs in China. \nThey would be willing to pay Pepe more than £20million-a-year to quit La Liga and join the ever-growing list of players who have decided to move to the Far East. AP:Associated Press 3 Pepe celebrates winning the FIFA Club World Cup with Cristiano Ronaldo \nCarlos Tevez last week made the move to Shanghai Shenhua in a deal that makes him the highest paid player in world football on a staggering £615,000-a-week. \nHe joins former Chelsea striker Oscar out in Shanghai after he completed a £52milion move from Stamford Bridge earlier in the month. \nAnd the money is set to continue to be put on the table as the Chinese game shows no sign of slowing up in their quest to build a powerful professional game in the country. \nJorge Mendes, the agent of Cristiano Ronaldo , says the Real Madrid star has rejected a £257million move to China this season in favour of staying in Spain. Reuters Pepe helped Portugal to the European Championship over the summer SunSport's Justin Allen goes to check out the Chinese Super League \nAnd now his Real teammate Pepe has a decision to make over whether he remains in one of the world's best leagues, or decides to cash in on the huge money on offer for the final few years of his career. \nAccording to Spanish paper Marca , one of the biggest factors will be whether moving to China would damage his chances of being part of the Portugal squad in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
