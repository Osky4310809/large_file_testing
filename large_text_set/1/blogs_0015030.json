Moana.\nThe rabid Disney fan of Samoan, Kiwi and Maori heritage, Wolfgramm and her bandmates (Tongan siblings Richard, Willliam and Moala) inspired by the film's focus on Polynesian culture.\n\"We all came away from it feeling incredibly proud of our Pacific heritage and just fell in love with the soundtrack,\" she told Mashable via Messenger.\n\"So when we decided to take our music to the next level, we thought what better way to start then to pay homage to our beloved Pacific culture as well as giving people a mashup of songs they are in love with as well.\"\nShot in an Auckland backyard, the video combines a number of key songs from the film, including the beautiful \"You're Welcome,\" all while showcasing the incredible vocal chops of Resonate's three singers.\nUnsurprising, the video has cracked over a million views in five days.\nWolfgramm can't quite believe it. \"We knew people would like it as Moana is such a huge hit here in New Zealand and the songs are so beautiful, but we never imagined it would've blown up like this,\" she said.\nWatch it though, and you'll see why it did.\nTaking a ride on this Lego train is simply mesmerizing\nWatching corn pop in super slow-mo is more satisfying than you know\n7 year-old's Taylor Swift impersonation is pretty close to perfect\nCat knows exactly how to get the best scratches", "external_links":
