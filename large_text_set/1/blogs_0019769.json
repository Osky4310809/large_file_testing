It was because the goals we have conceded in 2017 have been a little bit of the same story,\" he said. \nKlopp: I won't buy defenders \n\"The influence of throw-ins is a little bit too big on the goals we concede. It's not that teams create a lot of chances against us. That's still a good sign. Usually, they don't create a lot and still score. \n\"There has been a lot of talk about defence, you always speak about players - I speak about the whole defensive work of the team.\" \nLiverpool host Southampton in their EFL Cup semi-final second leg on Wednesday, trailing the tie 1-0.
