The pilot couldn't control it,” Youngule told The Associated Press. \n“I saw it until the very last moment before the fire engulfed the aircraft.” \nVideos from the scene captured the burning plane on the runway. \nWhen it crashed, the plane's doors busted open, allowing all 44 passengers and five crew members to escape, officials said. An unknown number were hospitalized for injuries.
