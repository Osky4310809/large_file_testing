The position was different. \n“But it’s not easy to manage the expectation and you need to settle your ideas and ­philosophy, so you need time. \n“I’m sure Pep will succeed, because he’s one of the best. He’s very emotional and shows it. But this is normal. All the people at Manchester City expect a different position, maybe 10 more points like Chelsea and it’s frustrating. It’s completely different taking charge of Manchester City than it is with Barcelona or Bayern Munich. \n“But he has the ­qualities to show he’s a top manager and with time he’ll show he’s a success here.” \nCity did provide a ­tantalising glimpse of what is possible under Guardiola, creating a string of chances in a one-sided first half where keeper Hugo Lloris denied them with a string of brilliant saves. It was another tough day at the office for Guardiola... (Photo: Getty) ...as City took just a point from a home match they led 2-0... (Photo: Getty) ...and were denied a seemingly cast-iron penalty (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nBut Lloris made big mistakes on two goals within nine minutes of the restart, first missing the ball when he rushed out to stop Leroy Sane, who went on to score, and then spilling the ball to allow Kevin De Bruyne to fire home from close range. \nDele Alli pulled Tottenham back into the game after 58 minutes, but the turning point was Kyle Walker’s push on Raheem Sterling in the area. \nIf Sterling had gone down, it would have been a penalty. But he was honest, stayed on his feet and then fluffed his shot straight to Lloris. Referee Andre Marriner did not give a spot-kick, and Walker was not sent off. \nIt got even worse as, within a minute, Tottenham were level through Son Heung-min. \nCity midfielder Yaya Toure admitted the result was another setback and claimed they were robbed of a much-needed victory. Blues fans were all smiles when De Bruyne put them 2-0 up, but the joy did not last (Photo: AMA/Getty) \nToure said: “We have to win once and after that things will come. People look at the details, the possession we had. But scoring goals is most important. \n“That’s something difficult to take, we feel a little bit robbed because we dominated. It was a fantastic game for us. It’s ­difficult to take because it’s a couple of points going away. \n“Tottenham are strong, they fight in every area but today we deserve the three points. \n“The manager was frustrated afterwards. When you see how many chances we had, ­particularly in the first half, it was ­unbelievable, against a big team like Tottenham. \n“They are one of the top teams this year. The manager and the players were frustrated, because we feel like we’ve been robbed.” poll loading Will Guardiola make Man City champions? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:51:30.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
