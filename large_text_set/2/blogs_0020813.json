He said they often \"decline over a period of years that happen through a series of much smaller steps,\" in an apparent suggestion that the Trump administration would contribute to that decline.\nUnited to Protect Democracy has already filed 50 Freedom of Information Act requests, and seeks to create a place for whistleblowers in the Trump administration.\nBassin reportedly received support from a \"huge network\" from other Obama lawyers. Politico reported that his group had a $1.5 million operating budget, and plans to double its staff of five \"in the coming months.\"\nThe post Obama Lawyers Unite to Launch Legal Attacks Against Trump Administration appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:16:15.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
