By Jack Holmes Feb 27, 2017 There are few more proud Conservative rituals than the ritual flogging of Obamacare. It's a job-killing, freedom-stomping machine that weakens the resolve of our allies, you see, and it must be done away with. Republicans pledged to end the scourge of Obamacare, but as John Oliver illustrated last night, they're also discovering that a lot of people kind of like what's actually in the law. That's true even if, as in the case of one cancer survivor who owes her life to the law, they can't stand its association with President Obama. (Gee, I wonder why?)   Most Popular Because the law has been successful in insuring more people and saving lives—in spite of its flaws, of which there are several—Republicans know the political costs are too steep for them not to fashion a replacement for it. Of course, they don't even have a replacement: Congress hasn't settled on a plan, and the White House has never offered even a hint of detail on its own mythical plan—beyond that it's going to be the greatest, and everyone's gonna be covered, and you're gonna love it. The hints at what the conservative plan would look like come from past proposals from Paul Ryan and new HHS Secretary Tom Price. As John Oliver pointed out, the many components of those plans—subsidies based on age, not income; health savings accounts; block grants for Medicaid; high risk pools—would almost uniformly carry the risk that people will be under-covered or thrown out off the insurance rolls entirely. Oliver compared each, in turn, to a thong. What people want in this situation is a wetsuit. Related Story Now This Is How You Politicize the Judiciary (Their proposal to replace the individual mandate with a shadowy \"continuous coverage incentive,\" which could introduce similar or worse penalties for non-coverage and which they refuse to talk about at all costs, may be even worse.) The truth is, the Republicans are like dogs chasing cars. If they were interested in the best approach for actually improving the nation's healthcare system, they would seek to remedy the broken parts of the law that have led to rising premiums and insurers pulling out of various markets. (Well, the real best approach would be universal healthcare, or at least a public option, but let's not kid ourselves here.) Except they pledged to their maniacally anti-Obamacare base that they would shit-can the law. They're caught in a vice between those forces and the people who will lose coverage—and, in some cases, die—if Obamacare is repealed without adequate replacement. But somehow, you get the feeling they won't be the ones who get crushed.
