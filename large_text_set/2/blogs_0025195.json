But the anniversary commemoration the other day showed a nation divided. \nThis need not be seen as the seed of destabilization but as a healthy expression of contrasting opinions in a democracy, which is the principal gift of the people power revolt. A democracy needs an effective system of checks and balances, which is provided mostly by the political opposition. \nThe national referendum on Rodrigo Duterte took place last year, and he won the people’s mandate by a landslide in free elections. Although his survey ratings since then have consistently slipped, the President remains enormously popular, and he and his aides need not be rattled by criticism or public expressions of dissent. \nEven a popular president and his officials can make mistakes or be tempted to abuse power and its perks. They should not expect citizens in a free society, especially the political opposition, to keep silent about such mistakes and abuses. They should even welcome criticism, so that they can implement measures to correct mistakes or address inadequacies in government service. An administration that does not tolerate criticism and dissent is bound to implode from its own follies. \nThe opposition, for its part, must respect the people’s mandate even as it plays the role of watchdog against lapses and abuses committed by those in power. For political opposition to be effective, it must have credibility. Malicious and unfounded criticism, smear campaigns and deliberate misinformation tend to backfire and weaken the opposition.   \nLast Saturday’s rallies must be seen as healthy expressions of divergent opinions in a free society. In a functioning democracy, people can agree to disagree.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:48:59.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
