As The Post previously reported , its A-list clientele includes Bill Maher and Gwyneth Paltrow who, on a typical evening, may encounter pretty young things wearing metallic pasties and black badges that read “Eat me” or “Touch me” on their décolletage, while holding platters of bite-size brownies.\nBut all the fun and pasties come at a price: Single men pay $1,850 per party, or $1,500 if they come with a female partner. For the erotic elite, the annual Dominus membership for $75,000, which includes admission to all parties, a sterling-silver necklace with a lion pendant, access to private rooms and — exclusively for the New York branch — unlimited Cristal Champagne, served by a butler.\n“The grand object of Snctm is the eroticism of the human race,” says Lawner, a divorced father of two who maintains that he’s intent on pushing the boundaries of sexuality and erotic freedom.\n“With our New York fraternal order, and the remarkable strength of our Los Angeles fraternal order, we continue together on this path toward enlightenment,” he says.\nDates for the club’s NYC branch are now available for reservation.
