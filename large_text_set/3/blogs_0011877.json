Bruce Loveles s, several Navy captains, a retired Marine colonel and an enlisted sailor are accused of accepting Cuban cigars, prostitutes and free hotel rooms from Leonard Glenn Francis , who also allegedly threw sex parties for U.S. sailors. The behavior described in the charges allegedly occurred between 2006 and 2014. \nFrancis, the former CEO of Glenn Defense Marine Asia, has pleaded guilty to defrauding the Navy of millions of dollars. The information he received from Navy officials allowed him to overcharge the government by $20 million. \n\"This is a fleecing and betrayal of the United States Navy in epic proportions, and it was allegedly carried out by the Navy’s highest-ranking officers,” said Alana Robinson, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California. \"The alleged conduct amounts to a staggering degree of corruption by the most prominent leaders of the Seventh Fleet – the largest fleet in the U.S. Navy — actively worked together as a team to trade secrets for sex, serving the interests of a greedy foreign defense contractor, and not those of their own country.\" \nEleven other Navy officials, including another admiral, have already been charged in the fraud and bribery investigation. \nDueling Princes: One Saudi Gets Lunch With Trump, His Rival Gets A Medal \nIf you want to know which of two rival princes is winning the battle for power in Saudi Arabia, just look at who's in Washington and who isn't. \nMohammed bin Salman , the 31-year-old deputy crown prince and defense minister , is at the White House today lunching with President Trump. Sources report there will be additional place settings for chief strategist Steve Bannon and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who’s been tasked with finding solutions to broader Middle East issues. \nBin Salman is also expected to meet with Defense Secretary James Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo while in town. On the agenda, the continuing civil war in Yemen, the Iranian nuclear deal, and stabilizing world oil prices. Big talk at a big table. \nCompare that to the consolation prize Mohammed Bin Nayef , the 57-year-old crown prince and interior minister, received in late January. CIA Director Mike Pompeo was in Saudi Arabia to present MBN, a long-time U.S. favorite and counter-terror expert , with the George Tenet Award. \nAccording to the Saudi news agency, the award was given for \"excellent intelligence performance, in the domain of counter-terrorism and his unbound contribution to realize world security and peace.\" It sounds more like a gold watch. Saudi Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman, left, talks with Interior Minister Mohammed bin Nayef during the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Dec. 9, 2015. NY Sex Predator Used Instagram to Lure 14-Year-Old Girl: Feds \nA New York pedophile who served nine years in prison for preying on underage girls has been busted again for allegedly convincing a 14-year-old to send him sexually explicit videos, federal prosecutors announced Tuesday. \nDavid Ohnmacht, 36, who lives in a leafy suburb of Bedford, was prohibited from having a computer while on parole, but that ended in November. That's when, authorities say, he began communicating with a North Carolina girl through Instagram, posing as a 19-year-old and sending her sex toys to use in videos. \n\"David Ohnmacht allegedly convinced a 14-year-old girl to send him sexually explicit videos of herself and threatened to release it to her friends if she did not send more,\" said Joon Kim, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. \nNow Ohnmacht faces a minimum of 35 years in prison and a maximum of 50 if convicted of the new charges, which include engaging in sex offense while a registered sex offender. \nOhnmacht pleaded guilty in 2003 to molesting six girls he met through a series of kid-friendly jobs, including party DJ, camp counselor and ice-cream truck driver. \nWhen he was released in 2011 and moved back to his family's home, sparking outrage among neighbors, he insisted he was no longer a threat. \n“I can’t drive. I’m restricted where I can go. I’m on a GPS ankle monitor. I have to report every time I move. I have a cellphone. I have to call my parole officer every time I move,\" Ohnmacht told WCBS-TV at the time. \"They are watching me.\" \nThe FBI is asking that anyone who had contact with someone using the Internet handles Dannyw290 or little.kitty.love contact law enforcement. \nA relative reached at Ohnmacht's home declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T01:25:15.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
