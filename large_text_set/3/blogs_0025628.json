That figures. touchdownelvis says: Mar 25, 2017 5:24 PM \nIt’s a shame about the alternate helmet proposal. Some of the throwbacks look far, far better with helmets to match, especially where the team logo has changed significantly. ak185 says: Mar 25, 2017 5:39 PM \nTheir proposals, minus the helmet rule, were all terrible. And of course, as per usual, the NFL will eliminate an entire element of the game due to “player safety”, which like a catch, has no defined meaning and usually will just result in a penalty. osiris33 (bandwagon since 1976) says: Mar 25, 2017 5:39 PM \nOh, so let’s take out a super exciting play that leads to more uncertainty in the kicking game because the Seahawks are good at it.
