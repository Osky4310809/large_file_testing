Welcome to a new revolution. Each week, Corinne Fisher & Krystyna Hutchinson (together known as the comedy duo Sorry About Last Night) interview a gentleman they slept with. Some they made love to, some they had sex with a few times and some they f****d in a hotel bathroom…er, what? Corinne & Krystyna want to make the world a more sex-positive place…one candid story of intercourse at a time. 2. “ Suite Buddies “ \nShow description: \nComedians Mike Albanese, Chris Scopo and Alex Pavone are grown men living together in a 500 square foot New York City apartment.

New episodes of general nonsense, rambling and the three buddies making fun of each other are released every Thursday morning! 3. “ Fat Pig “ \nShow description: \nHave you ever eaten frosting out of the can?

Well, yeah. Depression is an incredibly common and isolating disease experienced by millions, yet often stigmatized by society. The Hilarious World of Depression is a series of frank, moving, and, yes, funny conversations with top comedians who have dealt with this disease, hosted by veteran humorist and public radio host John Moe. Join guests such as Maria Bamford, Paul F. Tompkins, Andy Richter, and Jen Kirkman to learn how they’ve dealt with depression and managed to laugh along the way… 6. “ Happily Never After “ \nShow description: \nComedians Mara Marek, who has been divorced 3 times, engaged 7 and Andrew Collin, who is a child of divorce and single for 142 months, invite fellow divorcees and guests who have been negatively affected by divorce to share their stories to help listeners find laughter on the other side. The podcast has welcomed guests including ‘ New York Times ‘ best-selling author Peter Shankman and actor Langston Kerman from HBO’s hit show “Insecure.” 7. “ Positive Anger “ \nShow description: \nNathan Macintosh has noticed throughout his life that anger is the only emotion that is not accepted. If you’re sad, people help you through it. If you’re happy, that’s great! If you’re angry, people say stop being angry, but anger gets things done! ‘Positive Anger’ showcases that. From positively being mad about expensive schools to being livid about movie trailers, Nathan proves anger has merit. Oh, and is funny. This is also funny. 8. “ The Hot Mess Comedy Hour “ \nShow description: \nThe Hot Mess Comedy Hour is hosted by Andrea Allan and Emily Lubin, two blossoming comedians and world-class train wrecks. In each episode, they dive into the psyches of some of New York City’s messiest performers. Each guest comes equipped with their own baggage, whether it be a dark past, addiction, or neurosis. Andrea and Emily go head-to-head with your inner demons so that you don’t have to! \nThere you have it: absolute proof that whether you’re struggling with being single, hating the fact that you’re attached, living in a shoebox with six roommates, going through a divorce or dealing with food addiction, your anger problems or just overall hot-messery, you are not alone. \nWhile you may or may not be looking for a reason to feel better about yourself, I would strongly suggest subscribing to each of the above just because of their overall ability to show that life — while challenging — is really not all that serious. \nBesides, Trump is president now. \nWe’re going to need to start laughing at ourselves.
