Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA yob who tried to punch Crystal Palace defender Damien Delaney has escaped ban from football - despite admitting attack. \nJack Coles, 23, of Worthing, East Sussex, jumped the barrier and confronted the Irish centre half after watching his side slump to 4-0 at half time to fellow relegation battlers Sunderland at Selhurst Park. \nColes was frustrated as the Eagles were 'having their worst season ever' and Sunderland had just scored three goals in five minutes. \nSpurred on by chants of 'you're not fit to wear the shirt' from the crowd Coles shoved his chest at Delaney, 35, and attempted to punch him before being restrained by stewards.

Delaney squares up to Coles (Photo: BPI) \n\"The defendant was shown CCTV in his police interview and stated that he was watching the game and got frustrated as his team were doing very poorly. \n\"He stated 'they have been having their worst season ever'.\" \nColes insisted he did not target Delaney - he just took aim at the closest player to him. \nAdrian Butt, defending, said: \"It appears the whole crowd were chanting 'you are not fit to wear the shirt'.' \n\"It was a passionate moment and he wanted to express that they were playing so badly.\" \nHe admitted to using threatening words or behaviour that could have caused alarm or distress and entering the playing area at a designated football match. \nHe was fined £120, ordered to pay costs of £85 and a surcharge of £55 to be taken out of his benefits but was not banned from attending football matches.
