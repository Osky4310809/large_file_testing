A photo posted by Arielle Noa Charnas (@somethingnavy) on Dec 29, 2016 at 10:48am PST \nSome jumped to her defence, dubbing the move “outrageous” and “so wrong” but others pointed out that first class passengers “pay for luxury” and should enjoy a quiet trip. \nOne person wrote: “We were all babies once. Every adult needs to remember that when they give mothers and fathers eye rolls. You can’t help it, keep up the hard work!” \nAnd another added: “Babies cry - it's the way it is. And you paid for first class. But is it any worse than some loudmouth that talks nonstop the entire flight? \n\"No way should they have asked you to move - completely wrong reaction from flight attendant.” \nBut others argued: “As hard as it may be to understand, it's actually not just about you. What about all those other passengers that paid extra for first class? \n“They paid extra to have peace, quiet and space. If it were me, as soon as my baby was crying I would have moved myself.” \nA spokeswoman from Delta said: \"Delta flight attendants are trained to provide safe transport and excellent customers service. \n\"We fully support all passengers travelling in the class of service for which they paid.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T17:51:21.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
