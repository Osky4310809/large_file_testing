How dare a Christian refuse to take part in a gay marriage ceremony!\nOf course, it's all good when it's a bar in the West Village refusing to do business with someone wearing a Donald Trump \"Make America Great Again\" hat:\nBartenders at a West Village hot spot served up discrimination -- with a liberal twist -- refusing to serve a customer because he was wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat , according to a lawsuit.\nGreg Piatek, 30, an accountant from Philadelphia, claims he was snubbed and eventually 86’d by workers at The Happiest Hour on West 10th Street over his conservative fashion statement, popularized by Donald Trump on the campaign trail, he told The Post.\n“Anyone who supports Trump -- or believes what you believe -- is not welcome here! And you need to leave right now because we won’t serve you!” Piatek claims he was told as he was shown the door by a manager.\nThis should be an interesting test for the Left.\nIf you believe that no one should be allowed to refuse a customer because of the management's beliefs, then it's time to put up or shut up. If a Christian baker can't pass on a wedding cake for a gay marriage, then this bar can't refuse to serve someone because of a hat indicating support for a presidential candidate. Who won, by the way.\nOn the other hand, if you believe that businesses should be permitted to determine who they do business with, then there's no issue with a bar refusing to serve Piatek. Conservatives support the right to refuse service, but are also cheering Piatek's lawsuit for raising the obvious flaws in the notorious wedding cake case.\nIt's absolutely ridiculous that Piatek was treated that way over his political beliefs, but that's liberty. It would be nice if the Left in New York City recognized the hypocrisy of their positions, but I'm not deluded enough to picture that happening in my lifetime. A guy can dream, can't he?\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/22/man-wearing-maga-hat-denied-service-at-new-york-bar-sues/", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2017/03/18/i-survived-wearing-a-make-america-great-again-hat-in-nyc/", "http://nypost.com/2017/03/19/guy-wearing-trump-hat-sues-bar-for-refusing-to-serve-him/"], "published": "2017-03-22T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:09:23.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
