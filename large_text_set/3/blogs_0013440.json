Enrique Garcia confirmed Friday that at around 1:30 p.m., the department received a call from a person reporting a naked man behaving erratically. \nPolice arrived at the scene and tried to contact the subject, but the man fled in a vehicle. \nThe vehicle pursuit started near Hamilton Avenue and San Tomas Aquino Road.

When the suspect refused to stop, Garcia said that multiple officers fired at the suspect. \nGarcia said the suspect was struck at least once. He was transported to a local hospital after sustaining life-threatening injuries. \nNo officers were shot or injured in the incident. \nVideo shot by Chopper 5 showed upwards of two dozen SJPD patrol cars at the scene. Two officer SUV were stopped in front of and behind the suspect vehicle, a dark blue Dodge Ram pickup truck in the entrance to the parking lot to a Safeway store on Stevens Creek. \nThe right front tire of the truck was gone and apparently came off during the pursuit.
