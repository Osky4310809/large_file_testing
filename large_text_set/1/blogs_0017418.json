The images, which first appeared on ePrice.com.tw , depict an unknown Sony device with a similar design to its affordable effort from 2016.\nThe renders indicate that the device will drop the micro-USB port in favor of USB Type-C on this iteration of the XA and introduce stereo speakers. The front-facing camera and proximity sensor also appear to have switched sides.\n\nAdditionally, the pictures suggest that the device may appear in four color variants: red, blue and possibly dark gray and silver, while maintaining the slim side bezels that the previous handset was noted for.\nThe Xperia XA was met with mixed reviews when it was introduced last year as some believed its HD display, performance and camera capabilities werenâ€™t worth the $279 asking price, despite the attractive design.\n\nYesterday, Sony began to issue its press invitations for MWC 2017 in February where it is expected to officially unveil two new devices. A sequel to the Xperia XA could be one of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T11:44:26.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
