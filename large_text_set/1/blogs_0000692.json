Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA woman claims her brand new iPhone was full of contacts for celebs including Adele and Nick Grimshaw, after a suspected glitch saw the numbers appear on her device. \nSophie Highfield, 31, bought the new iPhone 5S from Three Mobile and for months didn’t notice any issues. \nBut one day when she typed in ‘M’ for mum, phone numbers for four other ‘mums’ she didn't recognise appeared on her screen. \nConfused, she began typing other letters - and says she discovered contact details for Radio 1 DJs, TV icons and Olympic athletes - and even singer Adele . \nOther contacts include gold medal-winning long jumper Greg Rutherford, comedian David Walliams, fashion guru Gok Wan and Spice Girl Emma Bunton. The woman claims Adele's number was on her phone She said Nick Grimshaw's contact details were on there too (Photo: REX) \nThe late actress Lynda Bellingham, Busted's Matt Willis, Loose Women's Denise Welch and Nick Lyndhurst - Rodney from Only Fools and Horses - are also listed. \nOthers big names include Radio 1 DJs Greg James and Nick Grimshaw - listed as Greg 'The Legend' James and Grimmy - as well as producers and other TV figures. \nAfter a month-long investigation - involving hours of work for Sophie - Apple have failed to explain how the problem happened.

I seem to have access to literally hundreds of people's numbers. \n\"I didn't notice it at first because the contacts aren't in my address book but when I go into messages to send a text and type in the letter 'A', it comes up with 'A' for Adele. \n\"There are loads of celebrities - Emma Bunton, Denise Welch, Gok Wan \n\"There are also lots of producers. I feel like it might have belonged to someone from the BBC or the TV industry.\" \nAs well as celebs, Sophie's mobile contains numbers for a host of random strangers - including 'Brandon from Subway' and 'Sophie Babysitter'. David Walliams' phone number was listed, the woman claims (Photo: ITV) \n'Kieran Window Cleaner', 'Christine in the club','Mark pest control' 'Suzie next door' and 'Kev the Ledge' are also in the iPhone's memory. \nOther entries appear to be for BBC staff members and others in the TV industry, including various people from the Loose Women and Britain's Got More Talent teams. \nWhile some numbers start with +44 and are from the UK, others begin with +1, meaning they are from the US. \n\"It is quite annoying having them all there,\" Sophie added. \n\"I actually have no idea how many numbers there are. There must be hundreds. \n\"I feel like it is a data breach. I've not been entirely sure what to do. It's kind of a big thing. \n\"I haven't purchased these numbers, they've just fallen into my hands.\" \nSophie, who bought the phone in June 2014, said there's no way she added all those people and believes she has the data of multiple other iPhone users on her mobile.
