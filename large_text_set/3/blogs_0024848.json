I mean, it was about three sisters saving Townsville, USA , from the evil forces of Mojo Jojo and other villains — so how could it not be in our Top 5?! It’s also safe to say that the show had a huge impact on us growing up. While the original run of The Powerpuff Girls ended in 2005, a whole new generation of kids can be inspired by the girls, due to a reboot of the series, which began airing in 2016.\nLucky for all of us, Hulu is now streaming both the original series AND the reboot, so we can watch whenever we’re feeling nostalgic. \nTo celebrate the streaming of the new Powerpuff series , Hulu launched an amazing contest showcasing some real-life powerpuff girls. People all across the country submitted stories and photos of girls doing amazing things in their communities. To participate in the contest, which ends today , fans visit the #RealLifePowerpuff website to submit their story. Contestants should first post their photo or video to Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram with the #RealLifePowerpuff hashtag.\nWinners will win an amazing Powerpuff Girls prize pack and the contest will also end in a one-day event for 100 girls between 8-12. Sounds like the perfect day!\nHere are just a few of the amazing submissions we’ve seen: #doublegold#RealLifePowerpuff girls#Contest My daughter Jazzmine always makes sure she helps kids that are being bullied in school etc,she has been in the martial art world since she was 4 years old and now she is 8, her goal is to stop bullying !!

I'm 13 yo old and will one day be an astronaut and go to Mars. I've been dreaming about going to Mars since I was 5 and was the only African American female on my team at Space Camp. I promote literacy and stem through book drives and reading to kids. I've collected and donated over 3000 books and read to over 300 kids about space and stem! I have sent over 400 youth to see Hidden Figures to inspire them to dream BIG and take flight towards their own aspirations! And plan to send many more! I am an agent of STEM, a literacy advocate and totally #reallifepowerpuff girl!!\" \nA post shared by Astronaut Starbright (@astronautstarbright) on Jan 31, 2017 at 5:50pm PST \nMy daughter is a #RealLifePowerpuff #because she is courageous #contest \nA post shared by Ali (@busyvamommy) on Mar 10, 2017 at 4:32am PST \nThe Powerpuff Girls is such an amazing show for girls . It inspired confidence, camaraderie, and showed that even superheroes have insecurities. We’re so glad that The Powerpuff Girls is here to inspire a new group of girls and that Hulu is showcasing some of the real powerpuff girls out there!\n\nWe’re definitely going to check the series out on Hulu next time we need a confidence boost.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:21:01.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
