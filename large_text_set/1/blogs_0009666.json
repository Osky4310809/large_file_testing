The two have done some great work together . So why can’t I get in on some of that internet love for Star Wars? I’m allowed to, DAMMIT! Anyway, since Rogue One has become a critical and box office success, it seems like Disney will maybe continue to be bold with its Star Wars Stories. And so, here are some bold moves that I think could be very rewarding for them! Creation of the Rebellion \nvia GIPHY \nWe get a glimpse of a defining moment of the Rebellion in Rogue One , when the once disheartened forces band together and descend on the planet housing the Death Star plans to help the rebels down on the surface. But what about the VERY beginning of the Rebellion? We got to see the dissolution of the Republic in Episode III , but there’s a big chunk in-between in which someone (probably Jimmy Smitts) was going around to systems that were unhappy while the Empire tried its best to stamp out dissent. Of course, the prequel trilogy taught us that Star Wars hasn’t always handled politics so well, so this one might be a dicey situation. Bounty Hunters \nvia GIPHY \nRemember that cool ass scene in The Empire Strikes Back where Darth Vader is talking to all of the bounty hunters, and you the viewer at home was just thinking “Damn, look at all of these cool-ass freaks\"? Why can’t we get a movie about those cool-ass freaks? Sure, Boba Fett seems like the obvious choice, but why not make it about lizard face and murder bot? You could daringly have the first Star Wars movie whose leads are not human, and you could have them pursuing some huge threat to the entire galaxy. It also would be the first Star Wars movie that probably wouldn’t have anything to do with the characters or plot of the original trilogy, so it might also be the hardest to market. Another Smuggler at Mos Eisley Cantina \nvia GIPHY \nIn the same way there was another baby who fit the details of the prophecy that lead to Harry Potter and Voldemort becoming fundamentally linked, there were other smugglers in that Cantina that Luke could have flown with. Why not give us a parallel story to Star Wars, but sort of a clownish version in which these two moron smugglers think they're saving the galaxy, but instead are just on some sort of pointless busy work mission? It could be the first Star Wars that was a LAUGH RIOT. Tie Fighter Ace Vs. X-Wing Ace \nvia GIPHY \nMan, how great was all of the space battle stuff in Rogue One ? It really reminded me that, as much as I liked The Force Awakens , it suffered from not having any proper space dog fights. So why not have a movie that’s focused on two combat aces from each side of the fight? They could grow to know each other, develop a rivalry, and then a begrudging respect, before finally having a final battle at the end. It’s like the movie Heat , but in space. Wookies \nvia GIPHY \nEveryone loves Wookies, for they are the thinking person’s Ewok. They might end up in the Han Solo movie, but I’m looking for an all out Wookies only-sort of thing. I’m talking fully subtitled, like it’s a foreign film. Shoot it in black & white too to give it the full arthouse feel. The Old Republic \nvia GIPHY \nKnights of the Old Republic is still one of the best Star Wars stories ever told, so it seems like that largely continuity-free era is a good place to find some stories. Hell, give us the very origin of the Jedis as an actual organized religion. That seems like maybe a story worth telling. Obi-Wan on Tattooine \nvia GIPHY \nThis one is rumored to be happening, and I’ll be honest: I’m all about it. Ewan McGregor acquitted himself pretty well in the prequel trilogy, so how great would it be to see Obi-Wan in exile, working behind the scenes to keep Luke safe and the Empire off of his trail, while still dealing with his remorse and guilt over failing to prevent Anakin’s fall to the dark side? \nSince we’re going to be getting one of these movies for the rest of our lives, what stories would you like to see?
