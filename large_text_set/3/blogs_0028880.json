But other jurisdictions say they’re concerned about the legal implications of holding someone for ICE agents, and say federal agents’ requests aren’t good enough.\nOn Friday ICE issued a new detainer form, replacing a jumble of forms that had emerged under the Obama administration. ICE’s new single form allows agents to demand notification when a potential deportee is about to be released from custody, and also asks that the target person he held for up to 48 hours so agents can get their to pick the person up.\nThe notification requirement is controversial with only a handful of the most strident sanctuaries, but the 48-hour hold is more problematic.\nThe National Sheriffs’ Association said it was looking for a clearer policy statement from Mr. Sessions.\n“Until the Department of Justice issues legal guidance confirming the constitutionality of current detainers, sheriffs will remain exposed to legal and ethical ramifications,” Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the association, said last week.\nSessions also said DoJ will try to \"claw back\" funding previously handed out to sanctuary cities.\nExpect numerous court cases to arise from this new policy, but it's hard to see how the cities have much of a case. That money belongs to the executive and he has broad leeway in deciding how to distribute it.\nThe problem with punishing sanctuary cities is that the cut off in funds is likely to be felt keenly by ordinary people who will have to deal with fewer police officers on the streets and less money devoted to fighting crime. No doubt the politicians in those cities will try to blame Washington. But there's a simple solution; cooperate with immigration enforcement authorities and you'll get your money.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/27/sessions-will-follow-through-on-trump-promise-to-punish-sanctuary-cities/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/27/jeff-sessions-says-hell-punish-sanctuaries-cities/"], "published": "2017-03-27T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:57:50.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
