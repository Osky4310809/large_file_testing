The British artist has had beefs with everyone from Justin Bieber to Lady Gaga , there was a public standoff with Interscope , she flipped the bird while performing with Madonna and Nicki Minaj at the 2012 Super Bowl, and there were problems securing a U.S. visa. \nShe’s set to return with the politically-charged new song “Powa,” in which she let’s fly with some unflattering namechecks for pop’s biggest stars. \nThe rapper teased her latest take-no-crap track “Powa” with a 10-second audio clip and its lyric sheet. It’s loaded with anti-authority bravado (“Throw up my finger and I’m taking on the Tower”), persecution complex (“I’m not your enemy, FBI checking me”), wicked wordplay (“Super-kala fascist, racist, espi-ala-tazors /Posers with the cases /They better not erase us /Betta come face us)” and her customary venom for anyone that’s ticking her off. \nAdd Rihanna , Madonna , Mariah Carey and Ariana Grande to that list. “I’m not Rihanna, I’m not Madonna, I’m not Mariah, or Ariana/I’ve been around in this world causing drama/The real spice girl, hot girl power,” she raps. \nCheck out the teaser and full lyrics below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:50:29.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
