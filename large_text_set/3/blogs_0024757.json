President Trump made it clear to reluctant Republican members of Congress should get on board with Trumpcare or face issues when seeking reelection in 2018, but it seems like the cracks in the Republican party are starting to show. \nAccording to CNN , an influential group of conservatives lead by Charles and David Koch are setting up a multi-million dollar fund for republicans Congress members seeking reelection in 2018. However, only those who vote against Trumpcare will have access to the funds. This is hardly the first time that the Kochs have used their influence, financial or otherwise, to sway Republicans from siding with Trump . This latest show of power is a final hour attempt to take down a bill that they believe does not roll back enough of Obamacare policies. \nTim Phillips, president of the Koch-funded Americans For Prosperity, said:\n“We want to make certain that lawmakers understand the policy consequences of voting for a law that keeps Obamacare intact. We have a history of following up and holding politicians accountable, but we will also be there to support and thank the champions who stand strong and keep their promise.”\nWhile their vote will not completely disqualify them for access to the promised campaign boost, but it will make it much harder for the Congress members in question to seek gain access to the funding.\nAs it stands, more than 20 Republicans have pledged to vote against the American Health Care Act on Thursday, which would kill the impending legislation. \n(Via CNN) \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:02:34.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
