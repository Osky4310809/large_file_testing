While some former government leaders insist the program was effective in obtaining critical intelligence, many others blame it for some of the worst abuses in the “war on terror” after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. \nThe reports of an upcoming order were already sparking significant alarm among Republicans as well as Democrats. \n“The president can sign whatever executive orders he likes. But the law is the law,” said Republican Sen. John McCain, who was held captive during the Vietnam War. “We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America.” \nIn a statement, McCain said that the CIA’s new director Mike Pompeo pledged in his recent confirmation hearing before the Senate that he would “comply with the law that applies the Army Field Manual’s interrogation requirements to all U.S. agencies, including the CIA.” Defense Secretary James Mattis vowed the same. \nAt a news conference Wednesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposed orders “This would be a step backward and I’m not alone in thinking that the path he’s going down is wrong,” Pelosi said at a news conference. Donald Trump says he would “like to have the law expanded” to allow waterboarding and the killing of terrorist families. The GOP front-runner pro... \n“Don’t ask me, just ask John McCain and others,” she added. “Reverting to that again does not support our values, but also endangers our people, whether it’s from a security standpoint, the intelligence community or the military. It’s wrong and I hope he will listen to even some Republican leaders on this subject.” \nA top Senate Intelligence Committee aide told CBS News’ Nancy Cordes that the laws prevent Trump officials from being able to do much in this arena on their own -- they would have to go through Congress. That’s why the draft calls for “review” of several different detention policies rather than outright changes to those policies. \nThe White House and Pentagon didn’t immediately comment. \nOn the campaign trail, Trump spoke emphatically about toughening the U.S. approach to fighting the Islamic State group. He said he would interrogate terror suspects with the outlawed practice of waterboarding, which simulates drowning, and a “hell of a lot worse.” Since becoming president, however, he has tempered those calls, noting his Defense Secretary James Mattis’ advice that torture is ineffective. \nPresident George W. Bush publicly acknowledged the clandestine CIA-run detention facilities in 2006. After condemnation in much of the world, Obama ended the program in his first days in office. \nA 2014 report led by Senate Democrats said the CIA’s interrogation program was more brutal than previously understood and failed to produce unique intelligence that couldn’t have been obtained through more traditional methods. \nThe draft order appears to echo Trump’s calls for greater unpredictability in how the U.S. conducts its national security policy. \nIt says national defense depends upon constitutional behavior, but also notes a need to “obtain critical intelligence information” so that offensive action, including military action, can be taken against those plotting attacks on the United States. \nThe document criticizes Obama for refraining from exercising powers critical to America’s defense, such as by opposing detentions at Guantanamo and allowing the “nation’s most sensitive interrogation methods” to be revealed. Such efforts had a “predictably negative impact on the morale of our intelligence community.” \nThe order calls for “modifications” and “additions” to interrogation policies “as consistent with the law, for the safe, lawful, and effective interrogation of enemy combatants captured in the global war on terrorism.” \nIt asks for “any updates or modifications” to a 2007 executive order signed by Bush that ordered limited compliance with the Geneva Conventions. Obama revoked that order after coming to office in 2009. \nIt recommends “any legislative proposals that would be necessary to protect our national security and to permit the resumption of an effective and lawful interrogation program.” \n“No person in the custody of the United States shall at any time be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, as proscribed by U.S. law,” the document adds. \nOn Guantanamo, the draft order says detention facilities “are a critical tool in the fight against international jihadist terrorist groups who are engaged in armed conflict with the United States, its allies and its coalition partners.” \nDetentions there are “legal, safe, and humane, and are consistent with international conventions regarding the laws of war,” it says - a direct rebuke of Obama, who sought to close the facility. About 40 detainees remain there. \nThe document says “over 30 percent detainees” who’ve been released have returned to armed conflict, with at least a dozen conducting attacks “against U.S. personnel or allied forces in Afghanistan.” Six Americans, including a civilian aid worker, died as a result of those attacks. \nAny pending transfers of prisoners would be suspended. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
