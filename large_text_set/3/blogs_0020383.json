The tribute bar Stay Classy, which started in New York and later popped up in California (sadly, not in San Diego), will soon arrive in Downtown Boston, according to Metro , and you better believe the bar will overflow with movie quotes and hopefully epic jazz flute performances. If you’re not really sure what to do with your hands, Stay Classy will fill them with cocktails that bear names like Throne of Lies, Scotchy Toss, and Glass Case of Emotion. When Zach Neil and Brian Link launched the concept in New York , their sole focus was cocktails, but they have wanted to add food into the mix for some time, Neil told Metro. Boston’s Stay Classy pop-up will be the first to feature food, including a Ma’s Meatloaf burger. No word yet on whether there will be whole wheels of cheese or good (but filling) burritos. The bar will take up residence at Umbria ( 295 Franklin St. ) from April 14-23. Those interested in checking out Stay Classy can secure a spot by leaving a message on the bar’s Facebook page with the date and time they’d like to visit and the number of people in their party.
