The 37-year-old just gave birth to her first child. It's unclear when exactly her daughter entered the world, but Pulliam introduced Ella Grace to her fans and followers on Instagram earlier today. The child made her social media debut in furry socks in the hands of her mother (rocking Tiffany blue nails): https://www.instagram.com/p/BPn2gyRgQ5B/?hl=en&taken-by=keshiaknightpulliam As for the newborn's name, Pulliam told <a href=\"http://celebritybabies.people.com/2016/08/19/keshia-knight-pulliam-reveals-daughter-name-and-inspiration/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>PEOPLE</em></a> last year that Ella Grace came from the fact that the actress sees her daughter as her saving grace. \"When I tell you through all of this the grace of God has so been with us and has covered us and protected us — she’s been my saving grace to get through it,\" she said. \"It’s knowing that it’s not about me. Knowing that on days when I want to curl up in the bed, pull the covers over my head and cry until my eyes fall out, that is not an option because she feels everything I feel and right now, it is bigger than me — it’s about her. It is about her being okay.\" So far, Ella Grace is okay. She's here and healthy, and Pulliam has her saving grace in her hands. Congratulations, mama!
