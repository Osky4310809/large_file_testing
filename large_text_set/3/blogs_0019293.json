I know I am, but I am not one of those lucky DIRECTV Now users that will be able to (legally) enjoy the show for free. AT&T has just announced new DIRECTV NOW “Go Big” or “Gotta Have It” customers will get a whole year of HBO.\nThis is definitely something to celebrate, especially considering paying for HBO Now would cost you $14.99 a month. It’s not cheap! You can further sweeten the deal with a free Apple TV. Simply pre-pay for 3 months of service and you are in for a good time.\nBrad Bentley, executive vice president and chief marketing officer, AT&T Entertainment Group, explains:\nWith our HBO offer we’re reminding consumers that DIRECTV NOW is the best choice for premium content. Our new DIRECTV NOW customers can stream HBO’s award winning content on virtually any screen, like ‘Game of Thrones’ and ‘Veep’ and its popular new series ‘Big Little Lies’ – all included with their service for a year. Plus, if you pre-purchase 3 months of DIRECTV NOW, you’ll get an incredible viewing experience with an Apple TV included.\nNot a bad deal if you are looking for a live TV streaming service… or if you are willing to switch. I know I am considering it for the free year of HBO goodness. The service offers over 120 channels of live TV that you can take anywhere. Just download the app from the Google Play Store and you are set to go!\nDownload DIRECTV Now ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T10:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T06:30:48.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
