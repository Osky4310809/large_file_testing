Pricing – all of which includes GST but without registration and insurance – ranges from a base of RM49,999 for the 399 cc Ducati Scrambler Sixty2 up to an eye-watering RM190,000 for the Ducati 1299 Panigale S. \nOf note are some reductions in pricing for certain models, especially in Ducati’s Monster model range. The Monster 821 is now at RM66,999 , down from RM75,999 last year, a reduction of RM9,000 while the Monster 1200 S, which retailed for RM120,999 in 2016, can be had for RM119,999 in 2017. \nFor the Ducati Multistrada 1200 , which made it to the top of our five best motorcycles of 2017 , the retail price is now set at RM114,999 , down RM5,000 from the 2016 price of RM119,999. The higher-spec Multistrada 1200 S, which comes with Ducati’s Skyhook semi-active suspension and cornering LED lights, retailed at RM139,999 last year, but is going for RM14,000 less this year, at RM125,999 . \nOn the sports bike side, Ducati’s 959 Panigale , tested by us at Buriram, Thailand during the 2016 Ducati Riding Experience, goes for RM99,999 . For the retro side of things, the entire Scrambler range has seen a price reduction. \nThis includes the baby Scrambler Sixty2 , which goes from RM52,999 to RM49,999 . For the bigger 803 cc Scrambler, the Icon now retails at RM52,499 , down from RM63,999, while the other models in the Scrambler range – the Urban Enduro, Classic and Full Throttle – drop by RM7,000 from RM69,999 to RM62,999 . \nIn 2017, Ducati Malaysia will be bringing a couple more new additions to the range in May, with more ride activities and customer events. Among the new models are the Multistrada 950 , Monster 797 , the award-winning Supersport and the Scrambler in Cafe Racer and Desert Sled flavours.
