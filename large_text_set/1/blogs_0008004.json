Sara Packer and her boyfriend Jacob Sullivan were charged in a conspiracy to murder young Grace Packer and dismember her body.\nThe charges stem from the hospital bed confession Jacob Sullivan made on Saturday as he recovered from a failed suicide attempt with Packer a week earlier.\nDistrict Attorney Matthew Weintraub said while Sullivan's confession cannot be used against Packer, investigators have put together a strong case alleging that she was complicit in the plot to kill the girl. The evidence includes Packer's purchase \"of sedatives allegedly used in an attempt to poison her daughter and the bow saw allegedly used to remove her limbs,\" according to court documents. Also, authorities allege she \"stored the body for three months packed in kitty litter in an attic closet one floor above her bedroom.\"\nVia The Morning Call :\nPacker was arraigned in district court in Newtown, Bucks County, at noon Sunday on 17 charges including criminal homicide, rape conspiracy, kidnapping and abuse of a corpse.\nSullivan, 44, was charged and arraigned after midnight Sunday. He faces 19 charges including criminal homicide, rape, kidnapping and abuse of a corpse. He could face the death penalty, according to Larry King, a spokesman for the Bucks County District Attorney's office.\nDistrict Judge Michael Petrucci denied bail for both Sullivan and Packer.\nCharging documents say Sullivan told investigators the couple had planned to murder the girl for nearly a year before killing her in July.\n\"We never have to prove motive, but it's certainly helpful,\" Weintraub said. \"This is one of the most shocking stunning motives I've ever heard of in my career as a prosecutor.\"\nCharging documents describe in gruesome detail Sullivan's admission of the rape, killing and cover up. He told investigators he and Sara Packer drove Grace Packer in the wee hours of July 8 to a rented Richland Township home. There, Sullivan allegedly physically and sexually assaulted Grace Packer while her mother watched.\nThe couple then allegedly drugged Grace Packer and left her bound and gagged in a closet of the stiflingly hot attic, expecting her to die. When they returned hours later and found her still alive, Sullivan got down on the floor behind her and \"slowly squeezed the life out of her,\" charging documents say.\nSara Packer reported her daughter missing several days later. Sullivan told investigators they stored Grace Packer's body in kitty litter in the attic until October, when, fearing police would discover it, they dismembered it in a bathtub and drove north on back roads to a Luzerne County reservoir where they dumped the body parts.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/parenting/2017/01/09/horror-pa-mother-and-boyfriend-charged-in-death-dismemberment-of-14-year-old-daughter/\nload more View as single page", "external_links": ["http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-charges-filed-missing-montgomery-county-girl-20170108-story.html"], "published": "2017-01-09T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:48:10.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
