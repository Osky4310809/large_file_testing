Equity release involves borrowing against the value of a home or selling all or part of it in exchange for a lump sum or a monthly income. Mr Godfrey said he believed the Government should encourage people to sell their homes to release cash through the building of suitable retirement homes. \nLast week the Government faced calls to offer the public an incentive to save for long-term care costs. Lord Warner, who sits on the Lords’ Select Committee examining the sustainability of the NHS, said: “If you’re not prepared to do it [fund care costs] out of general taxation, which is one option for the Government, then you’ve got to think of some kind of insurance basis with some degree of pooled risk.” GETTY One in 10 people pay more than £100,000 in care costs in old age \nGermany introduced a mandatory insurance system for long-term care in 1995 to cover people not able to live independently for longer than six months. Japan has a similar social insurance system. \nLord Warner said both models offered examples for the UK. At present, people can insure against future costs by taking out an immediate care annuity, a single-premium product that pays out an income once the holder is deemed to be incapable and in need of care. \nHowever, Baroness Altmann, former pensions minister, has called on the Government to launch a specific “Care Isa” that would encourage people to save for the eventuality of needing long-term care. Last week it was revealed that millions of families will face a five per cent hike in council tax to help bridge an estimated £2.6billion black hole in social care funding.
