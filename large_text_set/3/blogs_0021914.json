US President Donald Trump meets with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi at the White House in Washington. Reuters \n\"So perhaps we shouldn't have gone in, and certainly we shouldn't have left. We should never ever have left, and the vacuum was created, and we discussed what happened,\" Trump said after the two leaders met in the Oval office. \nTrump said his main thrust is to get rid of Islamic State. \n\"We're going to get rid of ISIS. It will happen. It's happening right now,\" he said. The US Defence Secretary General (retd) James Mattis and his team have done an incredible job, he said. \n\"A lot of things are different than they were even five or six weeks ago. We've been here a short while and people have said they'd never seen such a difference,\" Trump said. \nIn his remarks, al-Abidi said Islamic State is a terrorist organisation which threatens the security of the world.Speaking in Arabic, the Iraqi Prime Minister emphasised the fact that Iraq is on the forefront of fighting IS. \nThe Iraqi Prime Minister said that he wants to build on the strategic agreement Iraq signed with the US. The Prime Minister and his delegation are spending few days in Washington, during which he is expected to meet with congressional leaders on the hill. \nMeanwhile, US Senators Bob Corker and Ben Cardin, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a bipartisan letter to Trump urging continued US support to foster unity and stability in Iraq. \nThe letter was supported by more than a dozen other senators. \n\"We urge you to continue working with Iraq's leaders to preserve their country's unity and ensure its stability. This requires a plan for decentralising some functions of the government, disbanding Iranian-aligned militias, addressing the humanitarian needs of Iraq's community, and committing to a program of reconciliation,\" the letter said. \nLater, in an address to a Washington think-tank community, al-Abidi said that Trump has assured Iraq's government of greater US support as it confronts IS and stabilises the country. \n\"We have been given assurances that the support will not only continue but will accelerate,\" he said in his address to the US Institute of Peace, a top American think-tank. \nHowever, the US support is unlikely to include the United States \"sending troops in large numbers\" to Iraq. \n\"I think this administration wants to be head to head with terrorism, … to be more engaged. We are not talking about (US) military confrontation as such in Iraq,\" he said. \nAccording to al-Abidi, Iraq's forces \"are at the last stage of liberating\" the city of Mosul and its province from fighters of the Islamic State. \nLater this week, the Iraqi Prime Minister will also attend the 22-23 March conference hosted by the State Department to frame strategy for the 68-member Global Coalition to Counter ISIS. \n\"We need to have a plan together. We shouldn't be derailing the whole thing or losing focus against ISIS because of clashes among the region's major actors,\" he said. \nPublished Date: Mar 21, 2017 09:15 am | Updated Date: Mar 21, 2017 09:15 am Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T07:15:29.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
