It’s always important not to sweat the small stuff, but in this world, a lot of things can seem like a big deal. Obviously when you remove yourself, they’re not.”\n“I think being the Bachelor is like nothing else,” he added. “I think Rachel will find that to be the case during her time as the Bachelorette. There’s a reason why people don’t and shouldn’t date multiple people outside the Bachelor world. It’s messy and it’s not always fun. While it can work, it’s not ideal.”\nThough The Bachelor ‘s leading man has narrowed it down to two women — Raven Gates and Vanessa Grimaldi — his journey to find love was met with unexpected friendships along the way — some of which he hopes to maintain.\n“There are some great women,” he said. “I don’t know what’s in the future, but I hope we can all be friends at some level. I have a lot of respect for them. I would be lucky to have some sort of friendship with them.”\nWith the finale just around the corner, Viall admitted he’s pleased with the outcome.\n“I’m always happy no matter what,” he said. “I was happy with the decision I made.”\nThe Bachelor season 21 finale airs Monday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:29:08.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
