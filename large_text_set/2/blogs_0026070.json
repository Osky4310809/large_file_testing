Critics were floored, audiences were stunned but The National Review 's Armond White didn't see what they saw.\n\"The horror side of the story shows writer-director Jordan Peele...imitating the slave-era terror of 12 Years a Slave ,\" White wrote in the first negative review of the film, knocking it's \"fresh\" percentage on RT to 99%. \"Peele’s plot jacks up that film’s existential paranoia, a modern response to the helplessness of enslavement that politically naïve kids now dread as a modern American reality.\"\nSEE ALSO: 'Get Out' rips the mask off a monster we know too well\nWhite, a controversial reviewer who was kicked out of the New York Film Critics Circle , is known for provocative reviews and contrary opinions. He pointed to Get Out 's \"'post-racial' ironies,\" comparing it to Key and Peele's \"concocted unfunny routines deriding black paranoia and white superstition. Get Out shares that opportunistic misconception.\"\n\"In Get Out , just as Obama did, Peele exploits racial discomfort, irresponsibly playing racial grief and racist relief off against each other, subjecting imagination and identification to political sway,\" White wrote.\nLike a double-dealing demagogue’s speech, there’s just enough pity to satisfy black grievance and just enough platitudes (Rose back-talking a white cop) to make whites feel superior. When an Asian party guest asks Chris “Is African-American experience an advantage or disadvantage?” it reveals Peele’s own biracial anxiety.\n\"Peele’s self-congratulatory revenge humor has one particularly notable irony: It’s tailored to please the liberal status quo,\" White added.\nFor some different takes, check out a critic round up of Get Out here.\nBONUS: 'Get Out' rips the mask off a monster we know too well", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/dANHcb1n.jpg", "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/get_out/", "http://ew.com/article/2014/01/13/armond-white-kicked-out-of-ny-critics/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRfnevzM9kQ?enablejsapi=1&", "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445206/jordan-peeles-get-out-trite-get-whitey-movie", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/dANHcb1n.m3u8", "http://a.amz.mshcdn.com/assets/lib/aab-3e4af80fa7eef43b2c82c5f3e3a386e50b041bb6ee6b415a5a69b0c863479851.js"], "published": "2017-02-28T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:30:24.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
