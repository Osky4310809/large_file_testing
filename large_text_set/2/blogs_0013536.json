The SUV is due to be introduced sometime next month in Thailand, and the automaker has revealed some of the changes in store through a short video clip. \nFresh exterior bits include a redesigned grille and projector headlamps, complete with LED daytime running lights, new 18-inch alloy wheels and LED tail lights. The interior should also feature boast a number of refinements and offer an airier feel, as suggested by the beige-colour trim glimpsed in the video. \nTwo engine variants of the MU-X will be available. The first is a 1.9 litre Ddi Blue Power turbodiesel , which was introduced to the SUV in March last year . The RZ4E-TC offers 150 PS at 3,600 rpm and 350 Nm at 1,800 to 2,600 rpm, with two transmissions choices to pick from, a six-speed manual or a six-speed Rev Tronic automatic. \nThe other is a 3.0 litre unit, and for regional markets the 4JJ1-TCX should remain unchanged, offering 177 PS at 3,600 rpm and 380 Nm at 1,800 to 2,800 rpm. Last week, it was announced that the 2017 D-Max for Australia will be getting a revised Euro 5 emission-compliant version of the engine. \nThe 4JJ1-TC Hi-Power, as it is known as, offers the same power output as the 4JJ1-TCX, with 177 PS on call, but torque has been bumped up by 50 Nm to 430 Nm, available from 1,700 to 3,500 rpm. Said to be developed exclusively for the Australian market, no word on whether it will eventually find its way on elsewehere.
