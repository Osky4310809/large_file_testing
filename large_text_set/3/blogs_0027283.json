Smith's Premature Daughter Has Breathing Tube Removed by Jennifer Drysdale 3:56 PM PDT, March 24, 2017 Photo: Getty Images It's been a good week for the Smiths! NBA star J.R. Smith's baby daughter, Dakota, had her breathing tube removed on Tuesday night, his wife, Jewel Harris, revealed on their blog . RELATED: NBA Star J.R. Smith Reveals His Wife Gave Birth to Daughter 5 Months Early: 'Please Keep Us In Your Prayers' \"We arrived outside of Kota Bear's room and proceed to walk in, after I sanitized my hands my next step is always straight to peek into her bed and see if she is sheepin (sleeping) or awake pulling at her CPAP continuously attempting to snatch it off. BAABY BYE!!! When I bent over and looked at my daughters face and seen that she had a Ram Cannula on I almost passed the hell out,\" Harris wrote on Wednesday. \"I started jumping up and down laughing and screaming in disbelief.\" \"A few minutes later, Dakota's primary nurse joined us in her room, she walked in with this huge smile on her face :) I looked at her and said, 'Do you see our baby girl?' I cannot believe my eyes this is UNREAL!\" she shared. \"After a few minutes of her nurse filling me in on her status she then asked me if I wanted to hold Kota Bear.\" \"When I tell y'all I hopped up so damn fast, took off my sweater that I had on and draped myself with a hospital robe in 2.5 seconds, my new nickname should have been Flash! I then plopped back into the recliner chair so hard I almost flew through the doors and out into the hallway. I mean, I was beyond excited to hold our 2lb 13oz miracle in the palm of my hands for the very first time. What some mothers get to experience within the first 2 minutes of giving birth I had to wait 78 days, butwhat I will say is it was worth the wait because those very feelings, emotions and joy that took over my body trumps it all. I kissed her little cheeks, smelled her neck, gazed into her eyes and just smiled at life...this life...her life that has now become our life!\" she concluded. \"To God Be The Glory...I thank you.\" WATCH: Michelle Obama Does the 'Mannequin Challenge' With the Cleveland Cavaliers Smith revealed in January that Harris had given birth to Dakota, their third daughter together, five months prematurely. The family has since kept fans updated throughout their journey, and in February, shared a sweet photo of the basketball player holding his daughter for the first time.
