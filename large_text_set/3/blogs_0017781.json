(Photo: Seth Wenig, Associated Press) 3 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSAN FRANCISCO — Uber is retreating from controversial expansion plans in Oakland, Calif., in favor of shiny new digs under construction in San Francisco. \nOn Monday, Uber said it planned to scale back its plans to a few hundred employees as it buys a stake in two projects underway in the Golden State Warriors' new arena office buildings in San Francisco. Those projects are a block away from the new Uber headquarters under construction in the Mission Bay neighborhood. \n\"We are slowing, not halting, our plans to grow into our Oakland space. We're growing into the space,\" Uber said in a statement. \"We’re still planning to move some folks there in (the second quarter of) 2018.\" \nThat's a major reversal from 2015 when the ride-hailing company said it would relocate between 2,000 and 3,000 employees to the historic Sears building that it's restoring in the heart of downtown Oakland. At the time, the city's mayor Libby Schaaf hailed the move as a \"game changer\" that would turn Oakland into \"the hottest new center of innovation.\" \nActivists in this working class city, with deep cultural roots in social justice, music and the arts and a population that's more than half African-American and Hispanic residents, had raised concerns that Uber's influx would contribute to rapidly raising rents without lifting the fortunes of the city's workers. San Francisco-based Uber, now facing a leadership crisis after allegations of sexism and discrimination, has not released a breakdown of workforce by race and gender — unlike many of its peers. \nUber told the city a few weeks ago it planned to reduce its footprint, according to Schaaf. She downplayed Uber's decision, saying the company's decision to rent out some of the 380,000 square feet of premium office space will make room for other businesses and nonprofits grappling with the tightening commercial real estate market. \nThe news was first reported by the San Francisco Business Times . \nUber, the world's most richly valued private start-up at nearly $70 billion, lets people summon rides at the touch of a smartphone button. Its ambitions encircle the globe as Uber ferries millions of riders each day, battles the taxi industry and eyes new industries to disrupt. Uber is perhaps best known for its aggressive \"baller\" corporate culture that has bulldozed competitors and regulators alike. But a spate of controversies stemming from that culture has in recent weeks shaken the ride-hailing company. \nUber president Jeff Jones abruptly resigned Sunday, citing concerns about Uber's leadership issues . On Monday Uber confirmed that Uber vice president of maps and business platform Brian McClendon was also leaving, one in a string of recent departures including Ed Baker, who was vice president of product and growth, and Amit Singhal, senior vice president of engineering. Singhal was asked to step down because he did not disclose that he had been the focus of a sexual discrimination investigation at his former company, Google. \nKalanick is on the hunt for a second-in-command after a series of scandals that started with a former employee's blog post . \nThe growing technology community in Oakland, one of the nation's most diverse cities, has pushed to hire more women and underrepresented minorities than the industry norm, making it an outlier in an industry where white and Asian men hold most jobs. The fear: That Oakland would slip into a pattern followed by other cities in which the tech industry creates thousands of high-paying jobs, but few of them go to African Americans and Hispanics. \nUntil one of its former engineers in recent weeks accused Uber of sexual harassment and gender discrimination, the ride-hailing company had said little on the subject of diversity. Uber has repeatedly refused requests from USA TODAY to disclose the demographics of its workforce . Uber CEO Travis Kalanick now says Uber will release diversity numbers in coming months. \n\"For months, Oakland community leaders have been concerned about Uber’s impact in terms of gentrification and displacement, and have worried that this company does not respect Oakland's values,\" Greenlining Institute President Orson Aguilar said in a statement. \"With today’s report, we’re even less clear about what Uber’s plans mean for our city.\" \nAguilar called on Uber to meet with community leaders. \"Whatever Uber does with this building will have a huge impact on Oakland,\" he said. \nMore:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:22:32.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
