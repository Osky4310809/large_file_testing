Well, my darlings, I return tonight to report the titular stars of Vita and Virginia . Our Woolf will be portrayed by Eva Green, our Sackville-West by Gemma Arterton. \nAdvertisement \n\nAs Variety reports , Chanya Button ( Burn, Burn, Burn ) co-wrote the screenplay with Eileen Atkins, the latter of whom penned the stage play upon which the film is based. Button will also direct.\nWoolf’s affair with Sackville-West inspired her 1928 novel Orlando , a faux-biography meditating on the genre and on gender performance — not to mention an extended love letter to her inamorata. The film, Button says, will trace the romance and, accordingly, the composition of fiction inspired by real love. \nAdvertisement \n\n“Focusing on the time in 1927-8 during which Woolf wrote Orlando , the novel their relationship inspired, Vita and Virginia will be a visceral love story, a vivid exploration of creativity, and an energized perspective on one of our most iconic writers,” Button explains .\nThe film will also convey the social strictures corseting women in the early 20th century while demonstrating how both Woolf and Sackville-West resisted them.\n“We often associate women of the past with oppression,” Button begins , “bound by the duties of marriage, propriety, and domesticity; but what Vita and Virginia offers is an example of a relationship where bold, brilliant women bent these institutions to their will at great personal cost.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:24:44.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
