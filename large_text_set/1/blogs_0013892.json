Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool have been left with an agonising decision over whether to select Joel Matip this week. \nReds boss Jurgen Klopp left his centre-half out of the visit to arch-rivals Manchester United on Sunday, because world governing body FIFA failed to give a ruling over whether he would be eligible to play in the match. \nThe Cameroonian has been called up to play for his country in this month’s Africa Cup of Nations — despite announcing his international retirement over a year ago. \nWhen he refused to go, his nation’s bosses angrily declared they would invoke FIFA regulations which state he cannot play for his club for the entire duration of the competition.
