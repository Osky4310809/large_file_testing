Barca are no longer the best team in Spain \nAlthough Real Madrid fans have been saying this for weeks, for the first time since Atletico Madrid won the title in 2013-14, it is now hard to argue with the idea that Barcelona are no longer Spanish football’s best team. \nThey won the treble in 2014-15 and the double last season, but under Zinedine Zidane Real Madrid have been building up form, and are currently 38 games unbeaten. That in itself does not mean they are the best team in Spain, just the hardest to topple, but the sensational way they dispatched Jorge Sampaoli’s Sevilla on Wednesday night shows they are playing well too. \nWhile it seemed like they were lucky to go so long unbeaten, they are now playing with a swagger that has left Barcelona’s game this season. Teams like Bilbao now look at the Catalans and see vulnerabilities, chinks in the armour, where they once just saw a fearsome killing machine that chopped down everyone in their wake.

Aritz Aduriz is still going strong \nThe Athletic Bilbao forward turns 36 in February but is still proving he is at the peak of his powers week in, week out. \nHe opened the scoring like the classic poacher he is, stealing in to head home from close range after Iniesta gave the ball away in midfield. \nThen he set up Inaki Williams with a neat touch to tee up the young forward to blast the second past the helpless Ter Stegen. \nIt wouldn’t have been a classic Aduriz display without a moment of nastiness though—the forward is considered one of the dirtier players in the game. \nHe jabbed out at Barcelona centre-back Samuel Umtiti’s windpipe, causing consternation as the defender was treated, and more or less got away with it too, with both players receiving yellow cards.

Luis Enrique holiday claims were wrong \nBarcelona coach Luis Enrique allowed his star players plenty of time off over the festive period, with Messi, Suarez, Neymar and Gerard Pique all given extra holiday to make trips to South America at Christmas. \nWhen asked about the condition of his star players as they returned from their breaks, the coach insisted they were all fitter than when they left. \n\"We have been able to enjoy some well-earned holidays and I am pleasantly surprised with the players since their return,\" said the Asturian. \n\"They have come back in better shape than when they left. I am very happy with the response in training sessions and their performance levels. All my players are ready to compete.\" \nUnfortunately for him it didn’t seem that way, with Barcelona stunned by two Athletic goals in the first half-an-hour, while his team failed to create many chances of note.

Ivan Rakitic seems to be back in favour \nAfter he was taken off in the Clasico in the 60th minute, Rakitic went through a period where he was frozen out of the team. \nHe did not start five games in eight matches, with his spell out of the side ending when he was picked against Hercules in the Copa del Rey second leg clash at Camp Nou—hardly an accolade, with the key players sent off on holiday before the game. \nBut Rakitic played well and scored, with his reward being to be selected for this game, in which Luis Enrique started his strongest side. The Croatian impressed again, one of the Barcelona players that pulled his weight in a disappointing display against tough opponents. \nHis defensive durability gives Barcelona something which none of the alternatives for his role—Andre Gomes, Arda Turan, Denis Suarez, Rafinha—can offer.

This tie is alive and kicking, literally \nAthletic Bilbao and Barcelona have a history. Even dating back to Maradona’s time with the Catalan giants, when the Argentine was kicked off the field by the Basques. \nNeymar draws the same attention from the Bilbao defence with both Raul Garcia and Iturraspe both sent off for fouls on the Brazilian. \nHe will come under the radar next week when the teams meet in the second leg, along with Aduriz after his altercation with Umtiti. \nBut as well as the various individual battles which started here and will continue, this is one of the few last 16 ties which is still unresolved. Real Madrid, for example, are virtually through against Sevilla, while the same goes for Atletico against Las Palmas and Celta Vigo against Valencia. \nThis one is far from over. poll loading Will Barcelona turn it round in the second leg? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:30:45.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
