The venue of the fight, however, has yet to be determined. BREAKING NEWS: Top Rank promoter Bob Arum told ESPN that he has an agreement in place with Duco Events for Manny... https://t.co/8NdXFKb1BC \n— Dan Rafael (@danrafaelespn) January 11, 2017 \n“He (Arum) said the fight likely will take place in Australia or in the United Arab Emirates (Dubai or Abu Dhabi),” Rafael wrote in his ESPN report.   \nThe fight will feature Pacquiao testing Horn (16-0-1, with KOs), who happens to be a qualified schoolteacher from Brisbane, Australia. \nArum, for his part, is keen on staging Pacquiao’s first fight of 2017 outside the United States. The veteran promoter previously said he is also planning to broadcast the Filipino icon’s next outing on free television rather than on pay-per-view. \nPacquiao is coming off a unanimous decision victory over Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas last November to regain the title. Horn, meanwhile, knocked out Ali Funeka in the sixth round of their 10-round fight last December 10 for the WBO Inter-Continental welterweight crown. \nHorn is the No. 2 contender to Pacquiao’s title. - Dino Maragay  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T09:41:56.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
