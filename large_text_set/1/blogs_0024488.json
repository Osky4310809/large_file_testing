Under the two-year pact, Hall will continue to run the show while developing new projects. \nHall’s relationship with CBS dates back decades. Prior to “Madam Secretary,” Hall created the network’s series “Judging Amy,” which ran six seasons, and “Joan of Arcadia,” which ran for two. She also served on a writer on “Newhart” in the ’80s and “Northern Exposure” in the early ’90s. \nCurrently in its second season, “Madam Secretary,” starring Téa Leoni, is averaging 12.47 million viewers, ranking among the top 10 scripted programs this season. Though there is no word on a third season, with Hall’s new deal, it seems likely the political drama will land a renewal. \nHall is repped by UTA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners and Ziffren.
