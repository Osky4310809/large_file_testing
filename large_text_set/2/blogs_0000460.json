Here’s what I came up with. Sinking Simulator \nSinking Simulator , sounding exasperated. And I appreciate that. I like simulators, especially esoteric simulators, but I do not like joke simulators, because simulating mundane things is actually good and should be done well. Show me a rock simulator that attempts to accurately simulate the formation and physics of rocks, and I will definitely check it out. This is not something to half-ass as a gag. \nAnd that’s why I like Sinking Simulator. It is not a joke. It is a serious (if not necessarily ultra high-fidelity) simulation of boats sinking. Bravo. You Must Be 18 Or Older To Enter \nYou Must Be 18 Or Older To Enter is about trying not to get caught looking at porn online in the '90s. I don’t know how much fun it’ll be, but I can relate. For a brief time when internet porn was new, I actually thought that if I lied about being 18 the FBI would somehow find out. And yet I still clicked ‘yes’ when asked, which means that slowly downloading a picture of boobs outweighed my irrational fear that federal agents were going to raid my house. Puberty is wild. Jelly in the Sky \nJelly in the Sky is the sort of 2D artillery game we’ve been playing since the early days of PC gaming, but everything in it is made of jiggly clumps of adhesive particles. You have to see it in motion to understand why I chose it: Ludus silva \nAn “ecological strategy” game about designing plants—specifically to reside in south-eastern Australia—which compete for sunlight and water in an ecosystem you're in charge of balancing. Ludus silva is like if Spore had reigned it in a little and focused on one good idea, which is that plants are neat. A free demo of the plant editor is available if you agree. \nSadly, there’s been no news about the project for several years, so I wonder if it’s been abandoned like an unloved communal garden. Killbox \nKillbox is an interactive criticism of drone warfare based on documented attacks in Northern Pakistan. “It is an experience which explores the use of technology to transform and extend political and military power, and the abstraction of killing through virtualisation,” reads the description. \nThe trailer is all conceptual, but based on what I’ve read—try this Kill Screen article —one player strolls around a colorful 3D environment while another is submerged in icy comms chatter and the video feed of an airborne killer. Such a confrontational game seems unlikely to be embraced on Steam, where playful apathy reigns, but the best thing Greenlight can do is expose the platform to new things. Committed Dose \nImagine STALKER, but rather than facing down death in the surreal radioactive zone, you're supposed to contact FEMA and take other appropriate actions. \n“Radiation makes headlines,” reads the description of , “but few know how much is too much, and fewer understand the mechanisms behind radioactivity.” It’s an educational response to gaming’s obsession with radiation as a mystical force—a pragmatic half-life game. Counterpart \nYou are a colorful ball looking for a ball that is colorful in the exact same way as you, while other balls react to your colors, and sometimes a bigger ball called The Guardian pops in and gets really mad about violent collisions. I think I got all that right. I can’t say I fully understand everything about , but I'm fascinated by its creator's passion for the world he created. Triggerfish Drill Sergeant \nEven if the troops in Triggerfish Drill Sergeant weren’t fish, it would be an unusual concept: “organize and recruit troops to create the proper parade ground drill formations.” The troops are fish, though, to be clear. \nI’m cheating a bit, because this game", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:50:12.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
