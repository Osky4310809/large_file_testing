Dajerria Becton has filed a $5 million federal lawsuit against the cop, the city, and the police department. (fox4news) \n“The City of McKinney denies the claims alleged against it and the McKinney Police Department,” city officials said in a statement to the newspaper. McKinney police officer Eric Casebolt has Dajerria Becton pinned on the ground.

Demonstrators gathered near the Craig Ranch Pool for a protest three days after the June 5, 2015 incident. (Ron Jenkins/AP) \nThe officer can be seen in a cell phone video, taken by an eyewitness, grabbing the teen by the hair and pushing her onto the grass. Lying facedown on her stomach, Casebolt appeared to rest his knees on the teen's back to restrain her. \nTexas teacher loses job for rant about McKinney pool party \nCasebolt resigned from the department after the chief called his actions “out of control.” A grand jury decided not to indict Casebolt last June after reviewing evidence from a Texas Rangers investigation. Adrian Martin, 18, in dark blue shirt and tan shorts, tried to help a teenage girl who was being subdued by Eric Casebolt during a McKinney, Texas, pool party. (Deezil Greezil via YouTube) \nBecton said in court that Casebolt handcuffed her even though she followed his commands. The suit states the teen cried from the pain she endured as she repeatedly called for her mother during the incident. \nCasebolt’s attorneys have earlier said that the cop was suicidal at one point and that he wasn’t specifically targeting minorities.
