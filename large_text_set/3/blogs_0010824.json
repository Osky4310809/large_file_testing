King raised eyebrows Sunday when he retweeted a message endorsing white supremacist Geert Wilders, a far-right candidate for Dutch prime minister. \nIn his tweet King declared: Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies. https://t.co/4nxLipafWO \n— Steve King (@SteveKingIA) March 12, 2017 \nWilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies. \nCritics on Twitter immediately attacked King for his white nationalism rhetoric. However, one well known fellow white supremacist celebrated King’s tweet. Former KKK leader David Duke retweeted King’s tweet with enthusiasm: \nJust in case you were thinking about moving -> sanity reigns supreme in Iowa’s 4th congressional district. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/RRjTzAzlKw \n— David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) March 12, 2017 \nJust in case you were thinking about moving -> sanity reigns supreme in Iowa’s 4th congressional district. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain \nKing is known to be a Christian extremist and a white supremacist. USA Today reports that last July the Iowa Republican said white Christians have contributed more to western civilization than any other “subgroup.” \nWhile appearing on MSNBC the Iowa congressman went on a wild racist rant last summer. The Washington Post reports: \nKing’s tweet echoes comments he made during the 2016 presidential election when, as a supporter of Donald Trump, he suggested that white people had contributed more to civilization than any other “subgroup.” \nThat happened during a panel discussion on MSNBC hosted by Chris Hayes, in which King took issue with Esquire’s Charlie Pierce for suggesting that the Republican National Convention was energized mostly by “loud, unhappy, dissatisfied white people.” \n“This ‘old white people’ business does get a little tired, Charlie. I’d ask you to go back through history and figure out,” King said, “where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you’re talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?” \n“Than white people?” Hayes responded in astonishment. \n“Than, than Western civilization itself,” King replied. “It’s rooted in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the United States of America and every place where the footprint of Christianity settled the world. That’s all of Western civilization.” \nWatch the exchange below: \nAlso last year, while appearing on CNN, King argued that gay and lesbian parents should not be eligible for child care tax credits, claiming that only so-called “natural families” were the only families that deserve child care tax credits. \nBottom line: Rep. Steve King’s white nationalism and Christian extremism is a perfect fit for Trump’s America.
