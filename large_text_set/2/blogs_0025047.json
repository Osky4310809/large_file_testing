The minumum number rose from 100 to 120. Both estimates exclude kittens and count only panthers south of the Caloosatchee River.\n\"This latest Florida panther population estimate is good news, an indication that conservation efforts are on track in helping recover this endangered animal,\" said Kipp Frohlich, deputy director for habitat and species conservation for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \"In the 1970s and 1980s, it was estimated only 20 to 30 panthers remained in Florida.\"\nFlorida panthers, which once roamed across the southeastern United States, have been reduced to a remote swath of the state running from southern Everglades National Park to the cattle ranches, forests and farms west of Lake Okeechobee. They kill deer, hogs, small game and the occasional farm animal, with males staking out gigantic home ranges that force younger males to head to the fringes of the habitat.\nState and federal wildlife agencies have protected some of their habitat, while allowing development to proceed unopposed elsewhere. And in the 1990s they dealt with the inbreeding of the shrinking population by bringing in panthers from Texas, where they're called cougars, giving them more genetic variety and helping spark the population increase.\nLatest Florida panther estimate Open link Although the higher numbers are unquestionably good news for the species, the numbers are considered far too low to eliminate the danger of extinction, leaving the panther at risk from any number of possible catastophes, such as disease, a reduction in its prey animals or a few bad birth years.\nWhile conservationists applaud the increased numbers, they warn that panthers still face significant threats from cars, habitat loss and conflicts with people. Roadkills reached a record 34 last year, thanks partly to the increased number of panthers and to the growing number of people moving into their habitat. Real estate development, particularly in fast-growing Collier and Lee counties, has chewed up more of their land, covering it with houses, strip malls and schools. \n\"This population increase is great news for the iconic Florida panther, but it's tinged with tragedy: The death toll of 34 Florida panthers killed on roads in 2016 broke all previous records,\" said Ben Prater, southeast program director for Defenders of Wildlife. \"Federal, state and private conservation efforts have brought Florida panthers back from the brink of extinction, but there's still a lot more work to be done.\"\nIn one other hopeful sign for the panther, in November the first known female panther was seen north of the Caloosahatchee River, which runs west from Lake Okeechobee and was throught to form a natural barrier to the species' expansion to the north. \nAlthough male panthers frequently cross the river to the north, this was the first female to do so, and it raised hopes the species could establish a breeding population beyond its crowded southwest Florida range. \ndfleshler@sun-sentinel.com , 954-356-4535 \n  Endangered Species Environmental Science", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:29:06.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
