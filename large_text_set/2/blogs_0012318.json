All good up to that point.\nThe trouble starts when Harrison radios back saying he's in a helicopter. He stutters a few times trying to correct his mistake and then throws out his tail number. The bigger problem is he's still talking to SMO tower, which had already turned over to another tower.\nThe controller tells Harrison he's on the wrong frequency, and reminds him he should be communicating with the other tower.\nOur pilot sources say, on their own, these mistakes would be no big deal. But the FAA might be interested in these because of how his landing went  roughly 18 minutes later in Orange County.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:35:36.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
