(Photo: USA TODAY) \nLONDON — He was a skilled communicator and a celebrity. She was strong-willed and shared his disdain for big government. \nThey were the power political couple of the 1980s: Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Now a similar pairing is emerging three decades later in President Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May, who meet at the White House on Friday. \nMay arrives in Washington as the first foreign leader to meet Trump as president. Before their sitdown, she will have the rare privilege of addressing congressional Republicans in Philadelphia on Thursday. \nThe two leaders are expected to discuss terrorism, ending Syria's civil war, relations with Russia, NATO cooperation and a bilateral trade deal once the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, probably by 2019. Trade between the two countries is worth about $187 billion, and the United States is the largest single investor in the U.K. \nFor the British government, the symbolism of the visit matters more than the substance because of the U.K.'s long-standing \"special relationship\" with its former colony. \nTrump spoke to nine other world leaders in the 24 hours after his election before conversing with May. The trip helps put to rest concerns within May's ruling Conservative Party that former U.K. Independence Party chief Nigel Farage could get in the way of a strong relationship between the prime minister and Trump. \nTrump had suggested shortly after his election that the anti-establishment, anti-immigration Farage should become Britain's U.S. ambassador, an idea quickly rejected by May. \nMore recently, Trump and May have vowed to revive the closeness of their countries during the Reagan-Thatcher years. \n\"We have always had a strong relationship with the United States, but under the last president (Barack Obama) there's been a sense over here that it wasn't as strong as it could be,\" said Conservative Party politician Iain Duncan Smith, who served in former prime minister David Cameron's Cabinet. \"Obama appeared to spend the first four years in office forging relationships with everyone else. Now we have an opportunity to reinstate what we once had.\" \nReagan and Thatcher were ideologically and personally closer than any U.S. and British leaders since Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill during World War II. They were free-market, anti-Communist skeptics of government bureaucracies with good chemistry when dealing with the issues ranging from the Soviet Union to Northern Ireland. \n\"There was an incredible degree of affection — he admired her work ethic and she admired his ability to communicate with such great ease,\" said Conor Burns, a Conservative Party lawmaker. Burns, who got to know Thatcher late in her tenure, cautioned against drawing too many comparisons between Reagan-Thatcher and May-Trump. \"We won’t know what the chemistry will be,\" he said. \n\"They are extremely different characters,\" said Quentin Peel, a political expert at Chatham House, a London think tank. \"Reagan was a charming figure and I don't think one would use 'charm,' really, to describe Donald Trump. As for Theresa May, she's quite a cold and reserved figure and I don't think she has the same vision as Thatcher did. Margaret Thatcher had this vision of a deregulated world that she wanted to create or take Britain back to, whereas May is much more of a 'fixer,' a practical person.\" \n\"I have no doubt that both Trump and May are going to come out of this meeting and say everything is wonderful because they are both quite lonely out there at the minute,\" Peel added. \"She has few friends because of her determination to push ahead with Brexit (Britain's withdrawal from the European Union). And Trump is also, quite deliberately, alienating the world with his 'America first' talk.\" \n\"Can they be best mates? Well, they need each other,\" Peel said. \"May wants to be able to say that Brexit isn't the disaster everyone is saying it is. Trump, too, wants a trade deal with the U.K. so he won't be presented as this 'terrible protectionist' who only wants to pick fights with people.\" \nAnthony Scaramucci, a senior adviser to Trump, said he expected the president and May to \"get along very well.\" \nHjelmgaard reported from Berlin.
