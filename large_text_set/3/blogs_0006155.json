Some conservatives have slammed the new plan as \"Obamacare Lite.\"\nStephen Colbert examined it all in his opening of Tuesday's \"Late Show.\"\nFirst, he pointed out things from the existing plan that will stay in \"Trumpcare\": kids can stay on their parents' health care until they are 26, and insurance companies can't discriminate because of preexisting conditions.\nBut then Colbert got into the new elements, like insurance-company executives that make over $500,000 receiving a tax break (\"So, all of them?\" Colbert said) and the fact that Republicans released the bill without having estimates of costs from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\"So this bill is going to be like those fancy restaurants where they don't have what it costs on the menu,\" Colbert said.\nHe also pointed out that experts have estimated the Republican healthcare plan will cover \"20 million fewer Americans than Obamacare.\"\nIn short, Colbert thinks the only person who likes this plan is the Grim Reaper, who came out onstage and danced with Colbert.\n\"We're all gonna die,\" Colbert joked as Death walked off the stage.\nBut then Colbert addressed press secretary Sean Spicer's visual prop at his press briefing on Tuesday showing how much better Trumpcare supposedly is by stacking its 123-page plan next to Obamacare's 974 pages.\n\"When it comes to writing anything down, shorter is always better,\" Colbert said. \"Look, if shorter is better, why not just a one-page plan that says 'walk it off.'\"\nWatch Colbert's complete opening below:\nSEE ALSO: 33 documentaries on Netflix right now that will make you smarter NOW WATCH: 'Raindrops, drop tops': Alex Trebek raps the No. 1 hit 'Bad and Boujee' TV The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Donald Trump Stephen Colbert Trumpcare late-night Health Care CBS Obamacare", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:14:01.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
