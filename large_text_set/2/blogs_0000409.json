Richard Gordon, chairman of the Senate committee on justice and human rights that conducted an inquiry into the matter, does not see any reason to reopen the investigation despite Amnesty International’s findings that police officers were being paid to kill and gunmen hired to neutralize drug suspects. \nAccording to Gordon, what he has been hearing so far regarding EJKs are hearsay and could not serve as basis to reopen the investigation. \nGordon’s committee earlier ruled there was no evidence to prove that EJKs were state-sponsored. \n“The recurring issue of EJKs is something that daily confronts us. The events are not only worrisome, they have become disquieting,” Gordon said. \n“So far, however, the reports that I get are mostly hearsay… from people who tell me that X or Y or Z was reportedly killed through EJK or tokhang activities. But we cannot act on mere hearsay. And the (AI) report, on this score, does not yet rise above hearsay,” he added, referring to “Oplan Tokhang” or the police operations against drug suspects. \nBut Gordon clarified he was not closing the door on a possible reopening of the probe in the future.   \n“If anyone will come to me and present testimonial or other solid evidence to back up an assertion, I will be the first to say a hearing must be conducted. For to conduct a hearing based on hearsay is to expend precious government resources on mere tsismis (rumors),” Gordon said. \nIn an earlier interview, Gordon emphasized that a committee report on the previous hearings on EJKs had been prepared and which stated there was no proof of state-sanctioned EJKs taking place in the country. \n“We already made a decision on that. You say there’s extrajudicial killings but can you prove that these are state-sanctioned extrajudicial killings? No one is coming out with evidence,” Gordon said. \n“They (AI) can say anything about that but they still need to prove it and it’s a good thing they said it in fact because it puts a hold on some reckless people who may be doing such things,” Gordon said. \nThe AI said its team of researchers interviewed 110 people across the country, including some policemen, and documented 33 cases of drug-related killings, of which 20 occurred in police operations and 13 involved unknown armed men. A total of 59 people were killed in these operations, the report said. \n“We want the Senate to reopen its investigation (on EJKs), instead of prioritizing the death penalty bill. Unless we end this culture of impunity, these senseless killings, these crimes against humanity will continue,” AI Philippines campaigner Wilnor Papa said.
