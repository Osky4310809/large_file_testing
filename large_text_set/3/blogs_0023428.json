However, if you lean towards the traditional , physical copies of books are still an option for those in love with the smell or the sensation of rubbing fingers against pages while reading.\nJorge Luis Borges said, “I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library,” and we agree with him — but in order to stack our own Paradise, we need help carrying our books.
