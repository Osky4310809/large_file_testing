This is especially true in the United States, where abundant shale gas supplies have become a cheap power source.” \nIn China, coal demand declined as renewables , nuclear and natural gas increased in the power sector. \nThere was also a switch from coal to gas in industry and buildings driven by government policies to tackle air pollution. \nEmissions in the EU were largely stable as gas demand grew 8% and coal fell by 10%. \nThe UK saw a significant coal-to-gas switch in the power sector in the face of cheaper gas and a carbon price floor which makes polluting coal a more expensive source of energy, the IEA said. \nThe pause in emissions growth was welcomed by the IEA, but it warned it was not enough to meet globally-agreed targets to limit temperature rises to below 2C above pre-industrial levels – considered to be the threshold for dangerous climate change.
