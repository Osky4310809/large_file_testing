Abul Bajandar, a 27-year-old former rickshaw driver, is just one of four people in the world—out of 7 billion— to be diagnosed with “epidermodysplasia verruciformis,” and after having at least 16 operations to remove 11 pounds of growths from his hands and feet, he’s hopeful his surgeons have at last rid him of his warts. \nWhen Bajandar first contracted the disease in his small village in Khulna, he initially thought the warts were harmless. But soon they started taking over his hands, feet, and life: The disease rendered him unable to work and even hold his 3-year-old daughter. Doctors began operating on Bajandar over a year ago, and but weren’t able to permanently remove the warts—until now.
