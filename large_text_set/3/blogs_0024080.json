Official accessories made for the upcoming flagship smartphones were leaked yesterday along with their price tags . Now, we’re being presented with almost all the official images and features of the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus . \nThanks to WinFuture , we now have images of the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus in all the color variants that Samsung will offer. Moreover, the publication has revealed most of the features of the upcoming smartphones.

The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will reportedly offer 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch curved Super AMOLED displays, respectively, with a resolution of 2960 x 1440 pixels (18.5:9 aspect ratio, similar to the LG G6 ). \nThe camera on the smartphones will retain the 12-megapixel resolution (1.4µm pixel size), f/1.7 aperture, dual-pixel autofocus, OIS, and 4K video recording, but Samsung has reportedly included laser autofocus for more reliable focusing. The front-facing camera gets not only an increased resolution of 8 megapixels (with f/1.7 aperture) but also autofocus mechanism “ to capture highly dynamic situations. ” There appears to be an iris scanner for easy, quick, and reliable user identification and authentication. \nApart from an iris scanner, Samsung has also equipped its upcoming devices with a rear-facing fingerprint sensor which supports gestures to open and close apps. Similar to the Galaxy Note 7 (and more recently, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge), the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus would feature the Secure Folder service to store sensitive information, apps, and files. The devices are also said to be IP68-certified for resistance from dust and water (for 30 minutes and up to 1.5 meters). The report claims that the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus sport stereo speakers as well as 3.5mm headphone jacks. \nComing to the internal hardware, the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus feature a 2.5GHz octa-core Exynos 8895 processor (Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 in some markets), 4GB RAM, 64GB of UFS 2.0 internal storage, and a microSD card slot (up to 256GB). The smartphones will reportedly feature dual-band gigabit Wi-Fi, LTE, GPS, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, and a USB Type-C port. The Galaxy S8 is said to be equipped with a 3000 mAh battery, while the Galaxy S8 will reportedly feature a 3500 mAh battery. Both smartphones would feature fast wireless charging using a new convertible charger which was leaked yesterday . \nSimilar to the Apple iPhone 7 (and 7 Plus) and the HTC U Ultra, the Galaxy S8 and the S8 Plus would reportedly feature stereo speakers. The smartphones would be offered in Black, Blue, Gold, Orchid Gray, and Silver, and official accessories would be offered in matching colors. The official DeX Station with active cooling and full-sized ports would offer a Windows 10 Continuum-like mode. The Galaxy S8 will reportedly carry a price tag of €799, while the Galaxy S8 Plus will reportedly cost €899. \nSamsung would offer a service program called “Samsung Guard S8″ in some markets that lets buyers get their phone repaired within two hours. Official warranty extension would also be offered by Samsung in some markets. Also, Samsung will also reportedly offer one-time free replacement of the screen and a ‘Remote Support’ option.
