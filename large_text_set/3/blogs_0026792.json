Thursday's holiday aims to not only show appreciation for man's best friend but also to raise awareness about puppy mills and the importance of rescuing and adopting orphaned puppies. \nIt’s estimated that there are at least 10,000 puppy mills operating in the United States, according to the Puppy Mill Project . Puppy mills often house hundreds to thousands of dogs, prioritizing profit over the animals’ well-being. Many live in unsanitary conditions and receive little to no veterinary care. \nRead: 17 Famous Quotes About Dogs To Celebrate The Holiday \nWhile those dogs are being bred for profit, more than 3 million dogs live in animal shelters throughout the U.S. each year, according to the ASPCA . More than 1 million of those are euthanized every year. Most states have no laws or minimal laws regulating puppy mills and commercial breeding. \nFounded in 2006 by celebrity pet expert and author Colleen Page, National Puppy Day has gained global recognition in recent years. People are urged to do something special for young dogs and shelter dogs, and there are plenty of ways to contribute and celebrate. The National Puppy Day website recommends the following ways to give back: Adopt a puppy from a local shelter or rescue organization Donate to a local shelter Organize a peaceful demonstration against a nearby puppy mill Purchase something special for a puppy at home Make home safer for a puppy by removing chemical cleaners and purchasing only non-toxic products Write a local congressman asking them to support the ban of puppy mills in the state Host a community event to raise money for your local animal shelter \nHere are a few photos to help you observe Thursday's holiday and appreciate the magic of puppies, which bring inspiration and happiness to dog lovers everywhere every day. \nA three week old Chihuahua puppy named Tom Thumb poses in a tea cup in Renton, Scotland, Apr. 7, 2009.
