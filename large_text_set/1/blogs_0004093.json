But North End achieved that feat first in the Football League's maiden campaign 1888-1889. \nAnd Grayson said: \"People probably only remember the modern day Invincibles but ultimately this football club had the original Invincibles who did so well winning the FA Cup and the league in the first season. \n\"It's all about the past and the present but ultimately it's about a group of players on Saturday night going out to get the best out of our group, and ask questions of them.
