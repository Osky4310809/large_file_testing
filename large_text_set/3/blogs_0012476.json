Now, the freshly independent artist has yet another project in the works as he announced DROGAS Wave on Twitter yesterday (March 13). \nHis tweet simply says “Coming soon” and shares the cover art, which features another Chinese character similar to the design of DROGAS Light . (This one translates to “wave.”) \nThere will presumably be less controversy around DROGAS Wave ‘s title than another Chicago artist, who ended up changing his WAVES project to The Life of Pablo after getting criticism that he was biting Max B . \nDROGAS Light wasn’t reviewed by HipHopDX, but Fiasco gave himself a 7 out of 10 in his own rating of the project. \nFiasco had previously announced DROGAS and Skulls as the other two albums he was preparing to release before possibly retiring. \nCheck out Lupe Fiasco’s DROGAS Wave cover art below.
