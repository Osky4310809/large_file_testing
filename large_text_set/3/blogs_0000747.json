It looks like Nicki Minaj & Meek Mill have been taking a certain “liking” to some Instagram comments. On Tuesday morning, Meek Mill posted a pic on Instagram of him and Trey Songz in the studio, which could be alluding of new music on the way or Meek just being petty now that Trey & Nicki had choice words following Remy’s “Shether” diss over the weekend. Either way, it appears Nicki isn’t too fond of the picture Meek posted, and ended up liking a fan’s comment under the post about how sad the two were for trying to take down one bad bitch. “Pretty sad when all these Mfers have to come together to try to take down one bad bitch. Let’s see who's left standing with all that doe in the end tho,” Nicki liked. In the minutes/hour following, TheShadeRoom caught Meek reciprocating the action right back to Nicki by liking a fan’s comment about how Nicki’s “ass dropped,” or so it looks in the recent video shoot with Future. Check out all the pettiness on full display (below).
