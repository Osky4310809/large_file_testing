We’re here to talk about the style tips we can all learn from Silvio Dante, a.k.a. the most stylish motherfucker on the show.\nTony’s consigliere and manager of the Bada Bing titty bar, Silvio (played to perfection by Steven Van Zandt) was my favorite character. He rarely became the centre of attention but he was always there when he was needed; whether it was to crack jokes, offer some sound advice, or pull off a particularly troublesome killing. But, for me, it was his style that really set him apart from the other fellas.\nNow, in a fashion world seemingly helmed by Michele Alessandro’s wild and unashamedly showy vision for Gucci, not to mention a resurrection of suiting (shout out to #officecore ) and bowling shirts — little Sil’s style has perhaps never been so relevant.\n\nHere are five style tips to learn from Silvio Dante.\nThe key to Sil’s spring and summer looks is a dazzling array of shirts. They come in a mind-boggling amount of different designs and colors, but, as a general rule, he sticks to bowling shirts in the day time and smarter shirts in the evening. The only real discerning similarity between them all is that each one is a bold statement piece. Wild patterns, uneven pinstripes in odd colors, snakeskin-like silk materials — you name it, you’ll probably find Silvio Dante wearing it.\nYou’ll never find him buttoned up to the top, so wear them either completely unbuttoned with a white tank top underneath, or with at least three (go for four) undone to show off your jewelry and a bit of chest hair.\nCheck out our full guide on how to style bowling shirts .\nUnless you still have to wear one for work or you’re an early adopter of #officecore, chances are you haven’t worn a suit recently. We’ve already made a lengthy case in favor of the now-overlooked classic look , but if you’ve read that and you’re still not convinced, just have a little look at that guy above.\nThe cream colored two-button with its wide shouldered fit and leather leather lapels, the sovereign rings, the mad checkerboard print shirt, the facial expression, the hair, the crumbling cigarette. Now tell me again, what do you have against throwing on a jacket every now and then?\nGoing from no suit to full suit is probably too big of a jump to make overnight. However, there’s no reason why you can’t throw a jacket over a shirt and a pair of trackies, or wear a pair of smart trousers with a T-shirt and a leather jacket.\nSil knows the power and importance of jewelry. While often overlooked, a splattering of sparkly pieces can change an average or a boring ‘fit into something a whole lot ballsier. For Silvio Dante, there are only two rules: it has to be gold and you have to wear a lot of it.\nHis gold cross pendant necklace features throughout all six seasons, paired interchangeably with gold bracelets, watches, sovereign rings — but never earrings.\nSilvio’s slicked-back hairstyle may well have featured on our 2016 “ Best Short Hairstyles for Summer ” list, but we see no reason why this one can’t stick around a little longer. The big quiff and neatly trimmed sides is said to enhance the squareness of your jaw and face and add toughness to your demeanor. Just take it easy on the gel when it comes to styling it.\n\nThe most important tip we can all learn from Silvio Dante is to simply not give two fucks about what anyone thinks about you. Fancy wearing that leather blazer over a tee and some track bottoms? Do it. Fancy wearing nothing but a pair of slacks and a wifebeater? Do it.\nBut don’t just listen to me. If you need inspiration, listen to the big man himself in this 41-minute supercut of his best moments above.\nNeed more TV-inspired fashion?
