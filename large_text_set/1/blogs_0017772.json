PA:Press Association 2 Jake Livermore has completed his move to West Brom from Hull City \nPulis said: “Craig Gardner leaving left us short of a certain type of midfield player, and in Jake we have brought in a very, very good player. \n“I watched him a lot when he was at Tottenham and thought he would go on to establish himself as a top six player. \n“Maybe he has just drifted away a little from that – although having said that two promotions and a Cup final with Hull should not be forgotten. \n“But I believe this lad is a very, very good player and I’m delighted we’ve got him. \n“He is a fantastic character and as a player is good enough on the ball but also possesses fantastic energy.

We’ve got good young ones who are part and parcel of the future but we want to trim the age at the top end. \n“At the same time, we need to get experienced players in – players who still have a lot left in the tank and something to prove and Jake is one of those players.” \nThe midfielder goes straight into the West Brom squad for this weekend's Premier League clash with Sunderland.
