Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford \nAfter months in the Bay Area and then at UC Davis Medical Center, parents Aida and Arturo will settle into a new routine with their two daughters – one with morning walks in a two-seat stroller and bedtime stories in individual beds. It’s their first time living together in their suburban home since October, when Aida and the twins moved into a Palo Alto apartment to be closer to the twins’ care team at Stanford. \nFather Arturo, a heavy equipment mechanic, said he’s looking forward to hearing the girls scream “Papa!” when he comes home from work each night. Aida, a former airline customer service agent, said she can’t wait to see them crawl in two different directions. \nShortly after entering the house, Aida and Arturo placed Eva and Erika on the living room floor, where they each grabbed a toy. \n“Erika has definitely come out of her shell since the separation,” Aida said. “Eva has gotten a little more needy, I think.” \nThe weeks following the surgery were tenuous, as both girls staved off infection.During the procedure, reconstructive surgeons patched the gaping wounds in the girls’ abdomens by stretching excess skin fromtheir spare leg, torsos and backs. \nErika, who was the smaller andmore sickly twin when they were conjoined , healed more quickly than Eva and was discharged from Stanford on Feb. 13, though she was readmitted on March 4 due to vomiting. Both girls were officially released from the hospitalon March 10 and transported to UC Davis Medical Center, where they have been undergoing physical therapy. They left the Sacramento facility Wednesday afternoon. \nThe twins seem to remember navigating the world in one body, Aida said. Recently, Eva asked for socks for both of her feet, and Aida had to gently correct her, telling her she had just one foot, like her sister. Eva still asserts that “Erika took it,” their mother said. \nAida said she always believed the girls would come through, even when things got hard. Aida’s premature delivery,when she was in her mid-40s, was extremely risky, and their separation surgery carried a 30 percent chance of death for either or both twins. \n“I did believe that, even though I couldn’t picture them in my womb, they were going to be two little toddlers,” Aida said. “Now that we’re here, it’s amazing. We’ve been waiting two years for this.” \nThe road ahead will involve at-home physical and occupational therapy, as well as reconstructive surgery fortheir abnormally curved spines. \nTheir care team is doubtful the girls will be able to use prosthetic legs because they each lack a hip joint, but they’re receiving body braces from Shriners Hospitals for Children on Stockton Boulevard to help them sit, Aida said. The girls will also get customized wheelchairs to help them get around, she said. \nAt a recent therapy session at UC Davis, each girl used the muscles in her own leg to scoot, crawl and climb with assistance from therapists. \nErika also used her hands to support herself on a raised play mat while physical therapist Rachel Hammond supported her midsection. The 2-year-old bobbed enthusiastically to the Mickey Mouse tunes playing in the background, her leg bending and straightening to the beat as her tiny head flailed. The goal is for the girls to be able to mount and dismount a wheelchair on their own and walk with a crutch or other device, Hammond said. \n“I foresee both of them being busybodies, just given their progress until now,” Hammond said. “They surprise me every day. They’re changing and evolving and trying new things.” \nHow to help \nDonations for the Sandoval family can be made at www.youcaring.com , \"Sandoval Twins Medical Donation Account.\" \nThe family will also hold a six-course meal and wine-pairing benefit on April 29 at the Linde Lane Tea Room, 140 N.
