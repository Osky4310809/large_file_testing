Hank Johnson, D-Ga., reintroduced his \"Airport Security Act\" along with nine other Democratic lawmakers. His bill would make it illegal for most people to carry loaded guns onto airport property, and would only allow law enforcement officers to carry. \n\"Only law enforcement officials should be allowed to carry loaded weapons in the unsecured sections of our nation's airports,\" he said Tuesday. \"Over time, we have seen evidence that our airports are increasingly vulnerable to small-scaled attacks by • 03/29/17 8:08 AM \n\"The idea is that there is no American culture. Immigrants instead should retain their identity and America should accommodate the new arrivals rather than the new arrivals largely accommodating themselves to American culture,\" he said. \nHe noted that many Americans have a \"robust idea of assimilation,\" and even polls show that immigrants should adopt American culture. \nBut in that divide, overshadowed by political correctness, he concluded, \"There no longer exists a clear understanding of what we want from immigrants.\" \nPaul Bedard, the Washington Examiner's \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at Also from the Washington Examiner", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:26:53.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
