John McCain told Jake Tapper that he wants “Trump confidant” Roger Stone to testify in the Senate regarding his possible connections to WikiLeaks, Russia and the 2016 election: . @SenJohnMcCain : Trump confidant Roger Stone needs to testify in the Senate. #CNNsotu https://t.co/nscq3ItPjV \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) March 12, 2017 Trending Wait for it! Michelle Malkin predicts #NextMaddowBombshell about Trump \nRoger Stone answered McCain in an Instagram video on Tuesday, while dressed as Hunter Thompson no less: \n“Hi I’m Roger Stone. Sen. John McCain says I should be compelled to testify in front of the U.S. Senate about quote, ‘my ties to Russians or Yanukovych.’ I assume he means former Ukrainian President Yanukovych. He is acting more like Sen. Joe McCarthy than Sen. John McCain. Because I have ties to neither Russians or the Russian state or Viktor Yanukovych in any way. I’m anxious to have these hearings. I’m ready to be sworn and I insist that the hearings be held in public. See you there, Johnny Mac.” \nWatch: A post shared by Roger Stone (@rogerjstonejr) on Mar 14, 2017 at 7:22pm PDT \nGame on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T18:09:06.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
