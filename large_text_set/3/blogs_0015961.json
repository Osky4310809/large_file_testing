And while facts and figures clearly indicate that certain markets are bubbling over courtesy of all the same mistakes that caused the 'great recession' in 2008, nothing helps to confirm the truly obscene nature of a real estate bubble quite like attending a good ole-fashioned, get-rich-quick real estate expo. As such, below are the musings of one financial market observer who recently attended the Canadian Real Estate Wealth Expo as a joke but walked away convinced the system is about \"to blow sky high.\" \n* * * \nOriginally Authored By Tim Bergin of On Beyond Investing \nOriginally, I thought this would be a bit of a joke. There were billboards in all the Toronto subway cars advertising the Canadian Real Estate Wealth Expo - learn how to become a millionaire. I thought this was so ridiculous, it may be fun. What better way to experience the top of the housing market than watching Tony Robbins and Pitbull along with a bunch of US real estate professionals explain how Toronto real estate is the path to riches. \nPrices were originally $150 per ticket, but I was able to buy for $50. While it deeply bothers me that I paid $50 to these shameless (amoral) self-promoters, I thought it would be worth it to witness, in person, the top of the housing market. \nI had thought, there can’t be that many people stupid enough to attend this, but I was very wrong - 15,000 people were there! I was blown away. Bubbles are largely psychological. This crowd was tangible proof of that. 15k people in one spot listening to Americans explain why real estate in Toronto is an exceptional investment. The whole experience was horrifying . The crowd was very well-dressed, middle- to upper-middle class (from appearances), and super excited to hear how much money could be made if you just buy real estate (most of them clearly already owned). \nThe first real segment of the expo was a panel of Canadian developers and real estate agents giving their views on the market. It actually started off a touch bearish, which surprised me. Two of the panelists were saying that prices are exceptionally high and no market goes up forever. With that slight bit of caution thrown out there, it became a real estate FOMO-building talk. \nThere are, apparently, two very important things to know when dealing with real estate. First, you have to face your fear; this fear is to be ignored and then you should ‘just do it’ and 'buy now'. The next step is find what you can afford and then buy it. Ignore all ‘non-doers’, don’t overanalyze or focus on the numbers, just fucking buy. To allay fears the speakers are actually quite clever as they shift between a long to short term focus when it suits. For example, now is a great time to buy because short-term the market is on fire. If, however, markets cool then you just hold because it always goes up long-term - and you are a savvy long-term buyer, aren’t you? By showing no scenario where you can lose I can see how this pitch works on the susceptible. \nThe second important factor in real estate is financing. Not everyone has money, so what can they do? The answers were shocking. Be ‘creative’ was the first response. Pool your money, borrow from friends and family, own just 5% of a house, get the money however you can and just do it - remember, it only goes up. Other financing suggestions were get cozy with a lender and they will ‘bend the rules’ for you! The fact that the biggest condo developer in Canada (Brad Lamb) said lenders will bend (but not break, apparently) rules to get you financing in front of 15k people with most people smiling and nodding was shocking. \nSo there you go - when it comes to Toronto real estate, just do it (using borrowed money any way you can get it). \nThe booths outside of the presentation hall were just as troublesome. Plenty of “high double-digit monthly yields”, retire early with real estate, “everyone needs a place to live - buy apartments” type messages. Almost all of these pitches were second lien lending. Most offered yields in the 8 to 10% range. The presentations all suggested that you can borrow money, if you don’t have it, at 4% and then buy these investments at 10% - easy money. \nThe apartment pitch booth was like most other pitches - it revolved around stable cash flows + mortgage paydown by renter + equity appreciation = profit. (Now that all sounds great but owning a condo at current prices in Toronto is a negatively carrying asset, so where does this cash flow come from?) Further, investing in apartment funds is even better if you borrow the money to do so. The pitch goes on to explain that levering a 30% return makes you more money than not levering... \nThe Paramount Equity pitch was also interesting and stated in all caps “HIGH DOUBLE-DIGIT RETURNS ON YOUR CASH, RRSP”. This product pays monthly, is a second lien mortgage, with a one year term and LTV <85%. Paramount uses clever language that states they cover the cost of defaults. By that they mean they pay some of the fees, not the default risk itself. \nThere was a space to pick up business cards. I got quite a few from real estate investors. I plan on emailing them all to learn just how bad their pitch/product is. I want to learn more about how these second lien investor pools are sourced and just how bad this is going to be. \nAlso, perhaps there will be an opportunity to meet a bunch of distressed sellers, before they even know it themselves… \nNowhere in any of this was there ever a mention of risk, the dangers of leverage, how terrible negative equity can be, how that can trap you, etc. \nThe amount of shadow leverage in this system is crazy. The terms on these second lien loans is 1yr. What happens when all of these loans are called? Even lenders with first positions will see clients sell when these loans become due and there is no money to pay them. \nThis is going to blow sky high.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:42:50.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
