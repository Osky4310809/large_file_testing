By Tom Phillips   \nFinished Doom and looking for another id Software game to play? Rage is now available to buy digitally on Xbox 360 (and through backwards compatibility, on Xbox One) - more than five years after its original release. \nRage originally launched back in October 2011 to decent but not stellar sales. Critical reception was also lukewarm: the consensus was Rage had failed to meet the lofty expectations set by the arrival of a major new franchise from the creators of Quake, Doom and Wolfenstein. \nEarly plans for a Rage 2 were placed on indefinite hold while id Software focused on the recent Doom reboot instead. And, over time, the idea of Rage becoming a big new franchise, as was the original intent, slowly gathered dust. Rage is already an Xbox One Backward Compatibly title but now for the first time it can be purchased digitally https://t.co/rqPHL8S2f9 pic.twitter.com/e5eu6XoKXv — ð¬ Larry Hryb (@majornelson) February 15, 2017 \nBut now, with last year's Doom released and a success, could id Software be back working on Rage 2 once again? \nIt seems a little odd - there was little interest in a Rage sequel five years ago. But id Software has always said the option remains open. \n\"I'm proud of what we did, I'm proud of the universe that we built,\" id Software exec Tim Willits said back in 2013 . \"The franchise is not dead. We're not doing anything immediately with it, but when I designed the universe, I designed it in such a way that it would be easy to step back into.\" \nRage is also notable for being id Software's final game overseen by founder John Carmack - who afterwards left to join virtual reality firm Oculus.
