According to an eyewitness, one member of opening band ILL State started goofing around after their set, grabbing people’s cell phones and shooting videos as Carter tried to perform. Security ended up removing the guy, and as he was escorted out, Carter called out “Bye Felipe,” a take on Ice Cube’s famous “ bye Felicia ” line. The guy was Latino and took Carter’s comment as a racial slur, so he reentered the bar and attacked the former pop star, who ended up being taken to the hospital. Police are currently investigating the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:23:29.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
