I know it's a big story, but every time we freak out about a small-bore terror attack we play into their hands. \n— Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) March 22, 2017 \nAs you might imagine, Dilanian — the intelligence and national security reporter for NBC News’ Investigative Unit — experienced some immediate pushback over his choice of words. Fatalities and injuries are not “small bore.” https://t.co/VOpu31VLdc \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) March 22, 2017 Great.

Londoners were back on the Tube by day's end.They are not going to be terrorized. We shouldn't either. \n— Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) March 22, 2017 NBC's @MattMcBradley reports that Londoners are not panicking. Damned right they're not.
