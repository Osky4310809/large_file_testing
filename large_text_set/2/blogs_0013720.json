Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?” the president tweeted. \nMr. Flynn resigned after reports emerged last week saying he did, in fact, discuss U.S. sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador last year before Mr. Trump took office. \nSEE ALSO: How the first major shakeup of Trump’s presidency unfolded around Michael Flynn \nMr. Flynn said in his resignation letter Monday that he “inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information” on what was discussed in those talks. \nVice President Mike Pence said on CBS last month that sanctions were not discussed. The administration clarified after the new reports emerged last week that Mr. Pence’s comments were based on what Mr. Flynn had told him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:18:52.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
