More entrants are expected to be announced on tonight’s Monday Night Raw , but one former WWE World Heavyweight Champion didn’t feel like waiting until the primetime point of the evening. Early on Monday, a former member of The Shield decided to make it official and enter the Royal Rumble . \nMonday Night Raw already occupied seven of the first eight spots announced in the Royal Rumble , and now, they own eight of nine. As WrestleZone reported, Seth Rollins jumped on his Twitter account on Monday to officially declare for the match. \nLast year I missed @WrestleMania . This year I’ll be in the main event. Officially announcing my entry into the #RoyalRumble . #tearitdown \n— Seth Rollins (@WWERollins) January 9, 2017 \nAs many may remember, late in 2015, Seth Rollins severely injured his knee which kept him out of action for months. At the time of his injury, Rollins was the WWE World Heavyweight Champion, and he had to relinquish his belt to be vacated after 220 days as the title-holder. \nDue to the injury, Rollins couldn’t continue on as champion, take part in the Royal Rumble , and even had to miss WrestleMania . Now, he’s planning on being in the main event of WrestleMania 33 and taking on the WWE Universal Champion…whoever that may be. [Image by WWE] \nThe way things are going, it looks as if the title-holder going into WrestleMania 33 could be either Kevin Owens or Roman Reigns. The two are set to battle it out for the WWE Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble in three weeks, and that could say a lot for who goes to Orlando with the belt in their possession. \nOf course, there is still the Fastlane event in early March, and anything could happen there. \nSeth Rollins’ entry into the Royal Rumble officially takes the total number of entrants to nine. The first two names were put into the match more than a month ago ad within the last week, seven others have now announced their entries into the battle royal. \nMonday Night Raw", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:41:53.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
