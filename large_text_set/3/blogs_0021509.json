Since they can’t stop the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch, they’re going to try to delay it. Several top Democrats have already come out in favor of this plan including Senate minority leader Charles Schumer. From the Hill :\n“It is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment while this big gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the presidency,” the Senate’s top Democrat said, echoing language used the day before by Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (Calif.)….\n“You can bet if the shoe were on the other foot and a Democratic president was under investigation by the FBI the Republicans would be howling at the moon about filling a Supreme Court seat in such circumstances,” he said.\nAlso today, Sen. Elizabeth Warren jumped on the delay bandwagon:\nNeil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 21, 2017 \n\nBut is the Senate really going to pretend there's no cloud over @realDonaldTrump & move on w/ the Gorsuch nomination like things are normal?\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 21, 2017 \n\nThe FBI Director testified @realDonaldTrump 's campaign is under investigation for collusion w/ Russia. Lifetime court appointments can wait.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 21, 2017 \n\nNote the use of the word “collusion” in that final tweet. That’s significant because it shows Democrats are relying on what amounts to a conspiracy theory to justify delaying Gorsuch’s appointment to the court. They hope the FBI will come up with something that can retroactively justify their opposition. And how long would this delay go on? We have no idea but probably several months and maybe much longer.\nLast week I wrote that a coalition of abortion groups including NARAL and Planned Parenthood had sent a letter to Senators demanding they oppose Judge Gorsuch. If you’re thinking opposition to Gorsuch is really stemming from those groups, well, you’re probably right. In fact, near the end of the Hill story , we learn that NARAL’s Ilyse Hogue is calling for a delay on the vote using language that matches that of top Democrats. “The Senate should delay hearings on Neil Gorsuch’s nomination while the president is under an active FBI investigation,” Hogue said in a statement. “Short of that, Senate Democrats must filibuster this nomination,” she added.\nNARAL members are inside #Gorsuch hearing to show #WeObject to giving Gorsuch a lifetime #SCOTUS appointment! #StopGorsuch @peoples_defense pic.twitter.com/ho1dkfOpNn \n— NARAL (@NARAL) March 20, 2017 \n\nWill moderate Democrats get on board with the abortion industry or will they be thinking about trying to win reelection in a red state in 2018? We’ll know fairly soon since the committee vote on Judge Gorsuch will take place at the start of next month and the full Senate vote will follow shortly after that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:20:16.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
