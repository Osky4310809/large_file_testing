They started abusing each other. At this time, the son was already preparing noodles for me on the instruction of Adeleke. \n“The next thing I saw was that Adamu, who was eavesdropping, brought out a spiked plank and hit Adeleke with it. I cautioned him, but he faced me and hit me in the leg. I sustained some injuries. \n“When Adeleke saw that he could no longer handle the situation, he took to his heels. But the man followed him and hit him in the head as he tried to jump the gutter. He fell and hit his head against the edge of the gutter. \n“When Adamu saw that he had become unconscious, he took him into his kiosk and poured water on his head. He was doing this when a large number of residents stormed the place. When he sighted them, he abandoned the man and took to his heels.” \nHe said the suspect, speaking in Hausa, asked his son to flee in another direction. \n“The boy escaped, but we were able to get Adamu. We called the police and handed him over to them,” he added. \nThe mob was said to have destroyed Adamu’s kiosk and set it on fire after Adeleke died around 12am on Monday. \nPUNCH Metro learnt that the victim and the suspect had a close relationship. \nOne of Adeleke’s close friends, Tunde, said the victim once protected Adamu from a robbery attack. \n“But Adamu is ill-tempered,” he added. \nTunde appealed for support for Adeleke’s family members, whom he said depended solely on him. \nOur correspondent was told that the victim had recently bought a piece of land in Ogun State where he planned to build a house for his wife and nine-year-old daughter. \nA bus driver, who did not want to be identified, said the policemen from the Igando division handled the situation maturely. \n“The DPO spoke with the protesters. He released N15,000 for the corpse to be deposited in a morgue,” he added. \nA source said a mob invaded the Igando Police Station in a bid to lynch the suspect. \nHe said the DPO quickly transferred the suspect to the Area M Command. \nThe Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, said investigations were ongoing. \nShe said, “It was a case of murder. One Adamu used a plank to hit a bus driver, Adeleke, in the head which led to his death. The corpse was deposited in the Mainland General Hospital morgue for autopsy. \n“Meanwhile, we have intensified patrol in the area as normalcy has been restored.” \nCopyright PUNCH.
