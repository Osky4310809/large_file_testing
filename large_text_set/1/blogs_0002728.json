Charlie Ridgely   \nNow that the new year has been rung in, the countdown has begun for Netflix's next Marvel series. With Daredevil , Jessica Jones , and Luke Cage already getting their own shows, the streaming service is preparing to introduce the final Defender. \nIron Fist , the series following the legendary martial artist, is set to debut on March 17, 2017. Many details regarding the show - as well as the upcoming Defenders team-up series - have been kept under lock and key, and fans have been chomping at the bit to discover new details regarding the show's plot. \nLuckily, those same fans might have received their first look at an important part of Iron Fists's lore - and one that wasn't mentioned in any of the previous announcements. A photo posted by Jessica Henwick (@jhenwick) on Jan 3, 2017 at 3:01pm PST \nThat's right, we're talking about the legendary city of K'un Lun. \nOn Tuesday afternoon, actress Jessica Henwick - who portrays main character Colleen Wing - posted an interesting photo on Instagram. The picture showed a temple of some sort, with the caption \"All the world...\" \nGoing by looks alone, this set seems to resemble the holy city of K'un Lun - the training ground for the Immortal Iron Fists. The city is hidden in the mountains near Tibet, and it one of the Seven Capitol Cities Of Heaven. The inclusion of the city in the heavens could be a tie to the caption that Henwick posted with the photo. \nK'un Lun has been absent from any marketing for Iron Fist so far, but it's hard to imagine the show going forward without the city's inclusion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:48:03.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
