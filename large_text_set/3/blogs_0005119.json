Arsenal have struggled badly in recent weeks, having fallen out of the Premier League title race and needing a miracle against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday to overturn a 5-1 deficit. \nAnd with younger managers like Chelsea's Antonio Conte, Manchester City's Pep Guardiola and Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp having made the domestic competition even tougher, Silva questioned whether Wenger can still get the better of his main rivals despite his experience. \n\"He has been in the Premier League longer than those coaches. Wenger has spent a lot more years than them in the Premier League. They are younger and motivated. They have a lot of energy to look around and source ways to win against Wenger,\" Silva said. \n\"He has his own way of working, in which he believes. Irrespective of whether you are either a young or an old coach, you have to believe in something, and that's what he does.\" Arsene Wenger took over at Arsenal in 1996. \nArsenal haven't won the Premier League since that 2004 triumph, but Silva insisted that Wenger deserves to leave the club with another major title. \n\"He is a strong man, because in the last few years he has been criticised a lot. At the end of the day, he is upset with all the comments and it's not so easy to cope with that criticism, year by year,\" he said. \n\"He has kept competing with the other big clubs, despite not getting a major trophy. I don't know if he will leave the club at the end of this season or next season, but it looks like it. Honestly, I'd love Wenger to leave the club with another trophy. That way he can end his time at Arsenal properly. Perhaps he can then opt for another position within the club.\" \nMattias is ESPN FC's Arsenal correspondent.
