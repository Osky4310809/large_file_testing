The actors played a married couple struggling with the hints of infidelity in the original, and the director let Thompson know that he wouldn’t be writing any solo parts for her in the reunion.\n“It’s too soon. It’s absolutely right because it’s supposed to be for Comic Relief but there isn’t much comic relief in the loss of our dear friend, really, just over a year ago. We thought and thought but it just seemed wrong. It was absolutely the right decision,” she told the Press Association .\nThe Red Nose Day special airs in the U.S. Thursday, May 25 at 10 p.m. (EST) on NBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:55:36.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
