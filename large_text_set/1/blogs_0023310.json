Antoine Griezmann’s brother tweeting about Manchester United isn’t exactly on a par with putting pen to paper but it sends social media into a frenzy all the same. ‘Griezmann to United confirmed’ was the gist of the reactions to Theo Griezmann’s comment on Memphis Depay moving to Lyon. The Dutch winger made his debut for the French side in Ligue 1 last night. He came on as a substitute in their 3-1 win over Marseille. Sorry Memphis i think old trafford is better ! pic.twitter.com/ROFTTYHNJL \n— Théo Griezmann (@TheoGriezmann) January 22, 2017 \nIt was an impressive cameo but Theo couldn’t resist telling Memphis that he took a big step down. He wrote: ‘Sorry, Memphis, I think Old Trafford is better!’ An unnecessary comment to make and bound to fuel speculation.
