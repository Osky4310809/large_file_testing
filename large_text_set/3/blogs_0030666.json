If convicted, Arafat could face a 12-year sentence. \nAccording to the MCSO, Arafat was fiddling with the engine of his 1970s-model Volkswagen in the Walmart parking lot at 3040 College Park Drive around 1:30 p.m. Jan. 9 when he asked a passerby to purchase ammunition and explosive components. \nThe shopper, who refused, then called law enforcement to report that Arafat gave him a bag of money and told him to go inside Walmart and purchase shotgun shells and model-rocket motors. The shopper said Arafat wanted the items so he could finish making a bomb to blow up the Sheriff's Office. \nThe shopper also told deputies that Arafat made numerous other remarks about making bombs and mustard gas during their conversation. Deputies deployed a bomb detection dog to thoroughly search Arafat's van for any explosive materials but found none, according to the MCSO. \nThe MCSO said Arafat is known to local law enforcement due to multiple encounters regarding his diminished mental state.
