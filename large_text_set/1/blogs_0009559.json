Nokia filed for a trademark today in Europe for something code named “Viki”, which the application says will be used for mobile and web-based “assistants working with digital knowledge and combining all data sources into a single chat and voice-based interface.”\nSee also: 10 best personal assistant apps for Android November 21, 2016 At the moment, that’s all we know about this filing. When asked by Engadget , a Nokia spokesperson said that it does file applications for trademarks but “we don’t comment on how, whether or when they may be used for Nokia products or services.” However, if Nokia is indeed creating a new digital AI, it will be joining many others already available , including Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa , Microsoft’s Cortana, and the recently launched Google Assistant .\nOver the weekend, HMD Global revealed that the launch of its first Android-based smartphone with the Nokia brand , called the Nokia 6, will happen in China sometime in early 2017. There’s no word on if HMD’s branding agreement with Nokia would extend to any mobile software developed by the company, including any possible AI assistant. It’s also possible that “Viki” could also be offered for any smartphone or tablet devices as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T04:35:26.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
