Although we and our attorney believed we had fulfilled all the requirements to obtain the license, the Inspector General of KY disagreed and denied us the license,” EMW’s executive director said in a statement. “Unfortunately, our landlord has also declined to renew our lease on the space we have occupied... since 1989.” \n\"There is, indeed, a chill wind blowing for women of Kentucky,” clinic officials said in the statement, which was posted to the Facebook page of the Kentucky chapter of the National Organization of Women (NOW). \nThe clinic had been battling with the state over whether or not it required a license to operate after Kentucky received an anonymous tip last February saying that it only provided abortion services; state law requires that full-time abortion clinics have licenses. Two state inspectors deemed that the clinic needed a license, and reportedly found unsanitary conditions, including dust on the equipment, according to the Lexington Herald Leader.

The licensing process for abortion clinics makes it seem like “they’re almost creating things to make the clinic non-compliant,” he added. \nIn August, the Kentucky Supreme Court denied an appeal that would have reopened the Lexington clinic, which closed in June due to the licensing dispute, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. \nThe closure is “a terrible hardship” for women in the eastern part of the state, White told the Herald Leader. “The Supreme Court in my judgment totally overlooked that. I’m just sad we’re not going to have an opportunity to revisit that issue, the license issue.” \nKentucky NOW decried the closure as “unacceptable,” noting that it will “have a huge impact on low-income women across the state who are unable to afford transportation to Louisville and back. We must have ACCESS to safe, legal, affordable abortions without interference by the government.” \nThe remaining clinic, EMW Women’s Surgical Center in Louisville, is state-licensed. Lexington is about an hour and 20 minutes away from Louisville. \nThe closing of the clinic is not the only blow to abortion rights in Kentucky. Last Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a federal lawsuit to block a new abortion law that would require abortion providers to perform an ultrasound of the fetus and to show and describe the image to the patient, even if the patient objects.

He also signed a law that prohibits the procedure after the 20th week of pregnancy. \n“It’s a shocker that the ACLU is suing someone,” Bevin told the Courier-Journal. “We anticipated as much.

The rate increases when the access to “family planning services, including access to contraception and safe abortion” is reduced, that study found. \nWomen in the state have asked Kentucky NOW how they can help people who need abortion services travel to Louisville or to other states. The chapter has pointed to nonprofits such as A-Fund, which will help pay for the procedure, and the Kentucky Health Justice Network, which will provide practical support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:47:37.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
