OFFICIAL: The #Texans have traded QB Brock Osweiler to the Cleveland Browns. — Houston Texans (@HoustonTexans) March 9, 2017 The #Browns are planning on cutting Brock Osweiler, source said. Of course, if someone will trade for him… — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 9, 2017 Teams already have reached out to Browns to inquire about Brock Osweiler's availability, per team sources. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 9, 2017 The #Browns are seriously getting calls about Brock Osweiler.Seriously. — Benjamin Allbright (@AllbrightNFL) March 9, 2017 \nOsweiler had a rocky season in his first year as a starter, completing 59 per cent of his passes while throwing 15 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. \nHe was benched late in the season and regained his starting spot when backup Texans QB Tom Savage suffered an injury. \nOsweiler didn’t take advantage of the opportunity when he was reinserted as starter, completing 57 per cent of his attempts while throwing two touchdowns to three interceptions. Former Houston Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler. Source: AP \nOsweiler spent his first four seasons with the Broncos after Denver drafted him in the second round in 2012. He was mainly the backup until 2015, when he started seven games for an injured Peyton Manning, leading the Broncos to a 5-2 mark while throwing 10 touchdowns to six interceptions in that span. 3/9/16: Osweiler signs $72 mil. contract with Texans3/9/17: Osweiler and 2nd round pick traded to Browns — Andrew Siciliano (@AndrewSiciliano) March 9, 2017 The #Browns draft picks after the Osweiler trade:2017: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 62018: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7 — NFL GameDay (@NFLGameDay) March 9, 2017 \nManning retired shortly after the Broncos won the Super Bowl, paving the way for Osweiler to take over. But the Texans rolled the dice and gave Osweiler that four-year deal that included $37 million guaranteed. \nThe trade also could mean the end of Robert Griffin III’s time with the Browns, who might try to trade the veteran quarterback or see if he’s willing to be a backup. Looks like Osweiler's stint in Cleveland will last about 49 seconds longer than Andrew Bogut's.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:26:23.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
