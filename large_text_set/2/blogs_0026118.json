He has a violent history.” Brawner also claimed that the actor “uses drugs and drinks heavily on a regular basis.” \nA spokesperson for McCrary has not yet responded to TheWrap’s request for comment on the accusations. \nBrawner has received a temporary restraining order against McCrary, who has been ordered to leave the couple’s Canoga Park, Calif., home. \nAmong the alleged misdeeds: Throwing a cell phone at Brawner when she was eight months pregnant, and restraining Brawner and their daughter Zoey, born in September 2015, when they attempted to leave.

He said to her that ‘he didn’t like her … and that he wish[ed] he didn’t have her.'” \nAccording to Brawner, the latter incident occurred when Zoey was “no more than eight or nine months” old. \nBrawner also notes in the court papers that she’s filing for divorce from McCrary. \nPamela Chelin contributed to this report. 9 Former Child Stars Who've Gone From Hollywood to Handcuffs (Photos) \nEdward Furlong , once a rising star known for \"Terminator 2\" and \"American History X,\" has been arrested multiple times as an adult for domestic violence.
