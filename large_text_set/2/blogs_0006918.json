Meyers believes he’s responsible because of the jokes he told as host of the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, where Trump was present. Fallon believes, or at least thinks that some people believe, it may have something to do with the time he messed up Trump’s hair when he was a guest on the show before the election. Both make compelling arguments. When Fallon messed up Trump’s hair on The Tonight Show , it generated a huge response from the public because many people thought Fallon should have been harder on the controversial candidate rather than play around with him. Others said it humanized Trump when he smiled and let Fallon mess up his normally perfectly styled coif and thought the appearance led to more votes. Meyers may have a stronger argument, however, because without the night at the Correspondents’ Association dinner, when he believes we started down this path, that moment with Fallon never would have happened. Meyers said that throughout the dinner, Trump was the butt of numerous jokes made by Meyers and President Barack Obama. Many of the jokes were about a Trump run for the presidency and were met with laughter from the crowd — but not from Trump. And this is why Meyers believes he is responsible for the Trump presidency. “I made fun of him in 2011. That’s the night he decided to run. I kicked the hornets’ nest,” Meyers said.
