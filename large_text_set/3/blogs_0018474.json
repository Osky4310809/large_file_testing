SHARE Link Holden's rainbow car, running in the supercars races at Albert Park during the Australian Grand Prix carnival. \nDespite being identified with the LGBTQI community, BJR say they hope the rainbow motif will promote diversity and equality among people regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation. \nAlbury-based BJR has changed the design of the colour scheme of Percat's car for the supercars races at the Australian GP to imitate the six-shade look of the Holden Colorado ute that took part in the Mardis Gras parade. \nThe idea was initiated by the team to recognise the financial support it is receiving from Holden for the four non-championship races at Albert Park, the first of which will be run on Friday, followed by two on Saturday and one on Sunday afternoon before the twilight Formula 1 event. \nDespite Holden's public backing of – and adherence to – gender equality, including same-sex marriage, support of the BJR move was not a planned extension of the company's diversity policy. It is likely to be even more controversial that the sponsorship of the Sydney Mardis Gras, which alienated some Holden fans. Advertisement \n. \nThe supercars sector is actively promoting women in racing with the entry of Swiss international Simona de Silverstro in a NIssan, the first full-time female racer in top-level Australian touring car racing in 40 years. \nIt could be the first time a car racing team anywhere in the world has run a rainbow livery in support of tolerance of different sexual preferences. \nAn image obtained by Fairfax Media shows that Percat's Commodore V8 racer – one of three fielded by BJR in Supercars racing – features graduated bands of red, orange, yellow, green blue and purple front-to- rear, with Holden branding and the marque's Lion logo displayed prominently on the sides. \nThe signage, as well as on the front section of the car's roof, includes the slogan \"supporting equality\". \nAdelaide-born Percat, 28, who was co-winner of the Bathurst 1000 in his first attempt in 2011, wasn't told that he would be racing in the rainbow livery at Albert Park until Tuesday morning. He joined BJR this year as the team's star signing, replacing veteran Jason Bright in the squad's three-car Commodore line-up. \nBJR is a tight-knit family run team that has won races in recent years despite running on a much smaller budget than the established front-runners, and it was the smaller company's idea to follow the rainbow. \n\"It wasn't a Holden initiative,\" A Holden source said. \"Brad Jones Racing came to us. They wanted to show their support for equality in motor sport. \n\"We said fine, go ahead. \n\"This isn't about making a political statement or taking a stand. We support it, but it's not a continuation of Holden's mardis Grgras campaign. It's about inclusion, equality and diversity in general.\" \nHolden agreed to provide BJR with one-off financial support of the car for the event, with the team adopting the company's corporate diversity theme. The team doesn't have a title sponsor for the car. \nThere have been many pink race cars run to promote women's initiatives or charities to aid breast cancer research.
