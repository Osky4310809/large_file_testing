Photograph: NBC   07.37 GMT Last modified on   07.39   \nW ith such an eventful week, Saturday Night Live had a lot of options for their first show under President Trump. They chose wisely, with Beck Bennett as Vladimir Putin giving “a paid message from the Russian Federation”. The show’s take on the Putin/Trump relationship – a manipulative dictator and his oblivious puppet – is much clearer than their perspective on many other areas of Trump, and the very concept of the sketch says more than many of Baldwin’s supposed barbs. \nTopless as always, Putin promised Americans that everything will be okay because Russia loves the US: “It’s the most expensive thing we’ve ever bought.” This version of Putin is not entirely enamoured with Trump, taking a swing at the president’s CIA speech, the attendance records at the inauguration versus the Women’s March, and Kellyanne Conway’s patriotic inauguration outfit . \nAs is her way, Kate McKinnon stole the stoplight as a stereotypical Russian women who appeared to stoically defend Putin before being handed a fish and gasping: “My pension!”, and later sneaking into the background at the end of the sketch wearing a pink pussy ha t in solidarity. ‘Vladimir Putin’ brags about helping Trump get elected on Saturday Night Live. \nThe host, Aziz Ansari, arrived for his monologue in a sharp suit with a hand mic, ready to launch into his own tightly-crafted stand-up. Unsurprisingly, stand-ups have the best SNL monologues – they can do what they do best, and unlike other actors who are clearly terrified of this bit, it tends to actually relax them. Comedy nerds have been saying for years that the show needs to be hosted more often by real comedians – by all means, bring in Alec Baldwin and Jennifer Aniston for all the celebrity cameos you want, but let really funny people do the actual hosting. \nAnsari jumped straight into his material on President Trump, noting that it’s “pretty cool to know he’s probably at home watching a brown guy make fun of him.” Ansari’s stand-up has evolved a lot over the years, and he’s gotten the point where can mix genuine political and social insights about white supremacy with Chris Brown analogies that go way over my head. A poignant reflection on post-9/11 calls for fraternity with Muslims led him to realise: “I’m sitting here wistfully watching George W Bush speeches? Sixteen years ago, I was certain this guy was a dildo.” \nThe first sketch was a mock game show, featuring Ansari as a former child prodigy on a throne of books who crumbles under the weight of a pop culture category. The premise was simple and immediately predictable, but Ansari’s squeaky-voiced nerd yelling “n ” at the category announcement and guessing that the brother on Super Mario was named Kevin was well done, and the whole thing ended before the joke got old. \nThe show has been leaning harder on the pre-tapes lately, and they nailed it with an imagining of Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway as a fame-hungry starlet in the mold of Chicago’s Roxie. “The lady raking in the chips is gonna be Conway!” she belts in sparkly silver dress. “Who says that lying’s not an art?” The show has been fairly sympathetic to Conway in earlier sketches , but this one turned the screw, ending unsubtly: “And when the world goes up in flames, at least for now they know my name.” \nWeekend Update had a few good jokes – Michael Che’s mostly revolved around a too-perfect picture of Michelle Obama giving the side-eye at yesterday’s inauguration , while Colin Jost noted that Friday’s inaugural concert at the Lincoln Memorial was “the second worst live performance Lincoln ever attended.” Leslie Jones arrived to talk about Hidden Figures and the overlooked stories in black history: “Maybe I would have respected the traffic light if I knew those signals were coming from a brother.” \nEven the less memorable sketches generally landed well, Ansari and Melissa Villaseñor as a couple trying to spice up their love life was simple but effective; a fake law commercial allowed Ansari to scream: “This guy’s walking around with no kidneys!?!”; and a sketch with an animatronic pizza band was very dumb but undeniably fun and featured Kenan Thompson dancing. \nThere were a couple of mis-steps; a sketch where Ansari was arrested for not liking La La Land enough probably seemed hilarious in the writers’ room where this discussion first happened, while Cecily Strong and Sasheer Zamata singing “To Sir with Love” about President Obama didn’t add much – and was nowhere near as good as the “Jingle Barack ”. \nOverall, it was a very good episode, up there in Tom Hanks territory. It helped that Ansari has the comedic chops to carry sketches and that he could take the burden off the writers and produce his own material. Even better, if he was promoting something, it never came up. He was just a funny guy there to make a funny show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T10:40:23.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
