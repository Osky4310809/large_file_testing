PC PS3 A space or special character (e.g. !@#$%^&*) in front of the item's name will sort it at the top of the appropriate inventory list. Likewise, starting an item with lower case letters puts it at the bottom of the list. Once an enchantment is selected for an item, it will remain in place until the enchanter is exited or the item is enchanted. For single enchantments that have a pair of effects, e.g. Fiery Soul Trap or Fortify <spell school> and magicka regeneration, the second effect is constant and the number of charges, if applicable, is based on the first effect. Enchantments are affected by perks from their relevant magic school e.g. shock damage is affected by enhanced shock including enchantments with damage effects that are secondary. Drain and damage effects are all Destruction school effects. Having a higher enchantment level slightly raises the Dragonborn's defense against enchanted weaponry. This can be anywhere from 1%-15% and does not show as an active effect. Guards may ask to have their weapons enchanted. This cannot actually be done, as it is simply a line spoken by the guard when the Dragonborn's Enchanting skill is high enough. Even with the Extra Effect perk, an enchantment cannot be added to an already enchanted item. Any enchantments must be placed the first time an item is enchanted. Vampires , with the Necromage perk from Restoration and the Extra Effect perk, can get 50% spell cost reduction on a single piece of clothing by enchanting it with the \"Fortify (school)\" and \"Fortify (school) and Magicka Regen.\" If the Dragonborn has 100 Enchanting and Extra Effect perk, they can have spells from two schools that cost no magicka. 25% Fortify (schools) x 4 (chest, circlet, ring, necklace) = 100% spell cost reduction. If you have two enchantments of a different school on a weapon, you must have 100% cost reduction in both schools for the charge to be infinite. Destruction is perhaps the best school to do this with, as it allows powerful spells like fireball and incinerate to be cast for free, as well as allowing you to put fire, frost, or storm damage on your weapon for infinite charges. If you use a potion that fortifies a certain school of magic it can further increase the power of your weapon enchants as long as the potion lasts. A fortify destruction potion will increase the damage done by any destruction school enchant. A fortify illusion potion will increase the level of npc effected by a fear weapon enchant. A potion of fortify conjuration will increase the amount of time you have to kill an enemy to fill a soul gem per strike. A potion of fortify restoration will increase the power of the turn undead enchant and all armor enchants. Gear with a 1,740% boost to Alchemy will allow the production of Potions of Fortify Enchanting with an enchanting boost of 276%, which will give 100% off the magicka cost of any given school of magic in a single enchantment. Bugs \nThis section contains bugs related to Enchanting (Skyrim). Before adding a bug to this list, consider the following: Please reload an old save to confirm if the bug is still happening. If the bug is still occurring, please post the bug report with the appropriate system template 360 / XB1 , PS3 / PS4 , PC / MAC , depending on which platform(s) the bug has been encountered on. Be descriptive when listing the bug and fixes, but avoid having conversations in the description and/or using first-person-anecdotes: such discussions belong on the appropriate forum board . Click to see the list of bugs encountered The sale value of items enchanted drops each time an additional item with the same enchantment is made. This makes mass enchanting for profit gradually less profitable. This bug can be circumvented by using the following method: Save the game when first learning the enchantment intended for use for profit (usually a high cost weapon enchant such as banish) but before enchanting any items with it. It helps to save next to an enchanting table with materials for at least one enchantment. Keep this save. When mass enchanting in the future, when finished with the batch, save, then load the save from above, enchant once *only* with the enchantment being used for profit and then reload the more recent \"mass-enchantment\" save. The items will have returned to their correct, full value. 360 The Amulet of the Gargoyle in Dawnguard can be enchanted regardless of its initial enchantment. The effects put on the amulet will not appear when viewing it in the inventory. However the effects will appear in the \"Active Effects\" menu. The bonus to \"Summon Gargoyle\" will still work in Vampire Lord form, but the custom enchantments will not. 360 Enchanting any equipped items may make all of the Dragonborn's weapons appear enchanted, even if they aren't. Soul Siphon does not appear to work with certain Daedric weapons (ex., Dawnbreaker ). Enchanting bonuses from perks may not always function properly e.g. only allowing enchantments of 22% in Alchemy and/or Smithing, as opposed to 25%. PS3 Deleting all Skyrim game data and game updates and reinstalling again may resolve this Several enchantments exist that cannot be placed on anything or are duplicates of existing enchantments. These have been marked above with a *. The \"Shadowsight,\" \"Shadowstrength,\" \"Shadowstrike,\" and \"Shadowthrive\" enchantments are learned from disenchanting Linwe's armor , boots , gloves , and hood . The \"Blessing of Mara\" is obtained by disenchanting The Bond of Matrimony . Known items that cause duplicate enchantments are the Briarheart weapons and the Shield of Solitude. With the Extra Effect perk, both a weapon and an armor enchantment can be selected before selecting an item to enchant. If a weapon is chosen as the item and enchanted it will appear as an enchantment. However, the 'armor' enchantment on the weapon will have no effect and is not listed on the Active Effects section of the Magic Menu. The value of enchanted items may go down as Enchanting skill increases; however, sometimes after restarting the game, it may register a higher value; also, using a dead thrall, store these items in them, resurrect, kill and then loot the items, they may be of higher value, (only worked on apparel). Two items of the same type with the same enchantment but different names may eventually both have one of the two names. With the Extra Effect perk, switching the order of enchantments can prevent this. Movement glitches can occur when exiting an enchanting table. On the PC they appear to be related to using the mouse wheel to scroll through lists when the game incorrectly adjusts the camera perspective at the same time. Reloading a previous save will fix this issue but is not always necessary as the glitch is often temporary. If the camera is being controlled by the mouse wheel while in the menu, switch to third person view when exiting the table menu. Then the camera controls normally, no reload needed. If a companion uses a Soul Trap enchanted weapon with (x) soul gems in their inventory to capture a (x) soul and the Dragonborn then uses fast travel every (x) Soul Gems in the companion's inventory may be filled, x = petty, etc. The Destruction perks that improve damage for a specific magic damage type exhibit odd stacking behavior when applying these damage types to weapons as enchantments. The bonus can apply to effects it should not apply to, based on the damage specific description as well as stack with other bonuses from the other damage perks. Fortify enchantments do not interact with weapon enchantments in the same way across all platforms. On the PC weapons appear to always drain charges when used. On the PS3 and 360, 100% or more fortification in any school will reduce the charge cost of a weapon enchantment to zero. Fortify Restoration potions improve the results of Alchemy. This can be exploited to create stronger sets of Fortify Alchemy and/or Smithing equipment by creating stronger Fortify Enchanting potions. 360 Fortify Restoration potions can be stacked using two sets of increased Alchemy armors one at different strengths to create two different strength potions. Use the two potions alternating in a set of three (seems to reset/drop after three potions). Fortify Restoration potions improve the strength of enchantments when they are equipped. If a potion is taken immediately before equipping armor, the effects will be permanently improved until the equipment is taken off again. This can also be exploited to create stronger Fortify Smithing and/or Alchemy effects. PC Fortify Conjuration potions or some perks in this school may have an effect on Banish, making it a prolonged effect. With absorb health/stamina/magicka put together with Banish, these effects may also become prolonged. PS3 Sometimes dropping items enchanted by the Dragonborn will cause them to lose their enchantment(s) permanently. Characters with Vampirism and the Restoration perk Necromage will see improved strength of enchantments when they are equipped. The Fortify Alchemy gear can be maxed at 33%, the Enchanting potion at 46%, and Smithing potion at 184% (in conjunction with the Falmer helmet + circlet exploit). With Necromage, the bonuses from the 33% gear will show up as 41% in the active effects. PC 360 Fortify one-handed has no effect on daggers. Sometimes, enchanting with the \"Fortify Magicka\" enchantment will cause the item to give infinite magicka when the Dragonborn's magicka shows as empty. 360 PC Sometimes when enchanting an improved weapon, the improvement disappears in the enchanting menu, but will be there when it is crafted or enchanting is exited. Combining a \"Fortify\" enchantment with \"Magicka Regeneration\" does not improve the magicka regeneration rate. PS3 Enchanting certain weapons may get rid of any smithing improvements. For example, if a Blades sword is improved via smithing and then enchanted, the base damage may be the same as the unimproved Blades sword. PS3 The Absorb Magicka and Resist Magic enchantments can be obtained more than once. PS3 An enchanted weapon may suddenly have their name reset to the name before enchanting when dropped or placed on a weapon rack. 360 If there are manually enchanted items in inventory that do not stack, and if there is also a stack of unenchanted items of the same type at the same time, when selling the unenchanted stack, the rest of the enchanted versions of that weapon may all lose their enchantments. The shout Elemental Fury can be glitched to become a permanent enchantment that the Dragonborn is able to dis-enchant and enchant other weapons with. This does not replicate the effect of the shout, however, only the visual effects and the sounds.
