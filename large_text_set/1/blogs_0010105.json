Manchester United v Hull City (Tuesday from 7.30pm, live on Sky Sports 1 HD ) \nI think we're all waiting to see what develops under Marco Silva. They got a decent result at the weekend in beating Swansea 2-0. Jose Mourinho backs Marco Silva to do well in the Premier League with Hull, while Silva says 'it's not fair' to compare him with the Manchester United boss \nOne thing you have to say about Hull is that you can never question their players' commitment. It's another good game for Silva to look at his players before he gets down to the real business of trying to keep them up. \nAs for United, Jose Mourinho saying he's actually starting to enjoy Manchester now tells you he's starting to get things his way, with the players he's not interested in halfway out of the door. Wayne Rooney equals Sir Bobby Charlton's Manchester United scoring record Man Utd vs Hull City January 10, 2017, 7:30pm Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \nHe's got a lot of good choices with Antony Martial doing a bit more on the ball and Wayne Rooney going for the record. He could rest Zlatan Ibrahimovic again but I think he will want to play in a semi-final. \nHull will sit in and just hope to give themselves a chance but I don't see it happening and I think the hosts will do a fairly professional job and all but kill off their visitors' hopes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:47:39.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
