Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nUkip's war over a knighthood for Nigel Farage exploded today as one of the party's millionaire donors vowed to oust its only MP. \nIn a mind-boggling farce, a spokesman for Ukip donor Arron Banks claimed he will run against Ukip MP Douglas Carswell at the next election. \nThat would leave Mr Banks - expected to run as an independent - fighting the party he has handed more than £150,000 in Clacton, Essex. \nBut claims Mr Carswell was against a knighthood for Mr Banks' \"close friend\" Nigel Farage were \"the final straw\", the spokesman told the Mirror. Read More Arise, Sir Nigel Farage? Ukip formally demand a knighthood for their pint-swigging ex-leader \nMP Mr Carswell flatly denies opposing a knighthood for Mr Farage. \nBut his party descended into civil war amid the claims last night as Mr Farage called for the MP to be kicked out of Ukip. The ex-leader has called for only MP Douglas Carswell to quit... (Photo: PA) \nUkip had formally demanded the honour for Mr Farage last month claiming he was a \"figure of international signiﬁcance\". \nBut in an e-mail leaked to the Telegraph Mr Carswell - who was responsible for pushing the bid for a knighthood in Westminster - suggested Mr Farage could be handed an OBE \"for services to headline-writing\". \nThat led to claims Mr Carswell did not want Mr Farage, who he has fought in the past, to be knighted. \nMr Farage accused his only MP of being \"consumed with jealousy and a desire to hurt me\" after the leaked e-mails were revealed. \nThe MP strongly denied this, telling the Telegraph: \"I made every effort to make sure Ukip got its fair share of peerages and honours.\" ... and donor Arron Banks has even vowed to stand against him (Photo: PA) \nSo-called anti-establishment figure Mr Farage ducked answering whether he'd accept a knighthood today before heading to a waiting car. \nHe denied \"begging\" for the honour but did not deny he would accept one if offered. \n\"I'm not! I'm not!\" he said. \n\"This is not about that. It's got nothing to do with that. What it is is a constant attempt to sabotage.\" \nFormer Farage aide Michael Heaver compared Mr Carswell to a Soviet spy. \n\"Forget U-K-I-P, it was more KGB,\" he told the BBC. Farage and Banks are \"close friends\" (Photo: Getty) \n\"We've had people come into the party and try to try and take Nigel Farage and UKIP out of the referendum campaign because they deemed them toxic.\" \nHe added: \"This is not conspiracy. This is fact.\" \nMr Farage accused Mr Casrwell of having worked against UKIP's interests for years and dismissed him as a \"Tory Party posh boy\". \n\"Given we've got a new leader and it's pretty clear Paul Nuttall wants to take UKIP in a new direction - and I'm 100% behind that by the way - it's very tough to do that when you've still got Douglas Carswell still speaking out against you,\" he said. \n\"These Tory party posh boys don't like to discuss immigration because it's all a bit awkward, and you might not get invited to the right dinner parties.\" \nAsked if the party would formally comment on the row, a Ukip spokesman replied: \"Nope.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:35:32.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
