The tide was really far out and there was a bit of a drop off,\" he said. \nN igel said Molly was about five metres off-shore when the shark, believed to be a bull shark, seized her. \"It was very quick. It just took her under the water,\" he said, adding they never saw Molly again. \nSigns have been erected warning the public about the threat of sharks in the area. \n\"NSW Department of Primary Industries advises people to avoid swimming or surfing when it is dark or during twilight hours and encourages the use of the SharkSmart app which has safety tips for swimmers, surfers, divers, snorkellers and spearfishers,\" the council said in a statement. Kite surfers have had an extra thrill at Brighton Le Sands, in the form of a shark. @DaltsWorld #9News pic.twitter.com/AbZkASz87p \nT here have been a number of shark sightings in the area in recent weeks. \nOn February 9, a video clip showed a kiteboarder riding towards a great white at Brighton Beach, in Botany Bay , while a few days later a photographer captured the moment when swimmers were running across shallow waters as a large shark swam past in the foreground.
