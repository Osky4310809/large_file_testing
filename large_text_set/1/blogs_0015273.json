He's been in training for five days and would have been in the squad, 100 per cent, maybe on the pitch today, so I don't think it's fair. But we cannot do more and are still waiting on the decision. \n\"We could not take the risk, but we need to get an answer as quickly as possible because on Wednesday we have the next game and then another game and another game. We cannot wait forever. \n\"It is public now, we have this problem and we are not the only team with this problem. I think [West Brom head coach] Tony Pulis said a few things about it so I don't think that it is fair for the fans, for the clubs, for the team-mates and for everything. \nMourinho explains Klopp confrontation \n\"Now we have to wait in this moment and think about the game – and then after the game we will try again to get answers.\" \nLiverpool, who are third in the Premier League, are away at Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup on Wednesday.
