It is the only country in this category. \nIn the individual power rank system, Pakistan has been given the 198th position. \nThe individual power rank grades passports on each country’s characteristics and visa policies, while global power rank is calculated on the total visa-free score. \nWhile the top five ahead of every other country are Germany, Sweden, Singapore, Denmark, and Finland, it is Afghanistan that lags behind at the last position. \nPakistanis pride themselves about almost everything good and ethical put forward to them. And it isn’t entirely wrong of them to do so, given how the country has been progressing in various aspects, albeit at a sluggish pace. \nGiven Pakistan’s stagnating rate of growth – or rather deceleration – combined with terrorism, extremism, human rights, child abuse, feudal system, among other problems, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has computed the country’s Human Development Index (HDI) to be 0.538. \nPakistan’s visa-free score is 26, depicting a change of negative one (-1) from 2016. The figure denotes that Pakistan welcomes people from six countries on a visa-free basis - the list is longer for holders of Diplomatic or Official passports from other countries. Additionally, citizens from 20 countries can enter Pakistan on a visa-on-arrival system. 0 0 Pakistani passport ranked second-last in global index, almost losing out   Global Passport Index,   Pakistani Passport, Pakistani Passport Ranking, Passport Index, Passport Ranking.   \"Pakistani passport ranked second-last in global index, almost losing out\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/127686-Pakistani-passport-ranked-second-last-in-global-index-almost-losing-out+geo%2FGiKR+%28Geo+Pakistan+- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T16:02:49.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
