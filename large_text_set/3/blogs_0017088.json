Thus – for the first time in at least 183 years – the Danish central government has no foreign currency loans,\" a statement from the Danmarks Nationalbank said.\nThe government had previously undertaken foreign loans to ensure that it could keep its foreign exchange reserves at adequate levels. However, reserves have plunged in recent years, meaning that no more loans have been taken, allowing existing ones to be repaid.\nFX reserves have shrunk thanks to huge interventions in the market from the central bank in order to keep the Danish krone pegged to the euro, which have drained the reserves.\n\"The sole reason why the Danish central government raises loans in foreign currency is to ensure that the foreign exchange reserve is sufficient. In recent years, the central government has not needed to raise any loans in foreign currency, and the loans have been gradually repaid,\" the bank says.\nPreviously, the Danish government had had some form of debt obligation in foreign currency continuously since at least 1834. Prior to that point, record keeping was not accurate enough to determine whether or not foreign loans were owed.\n\"The central government was close to repaying all foreign currency loans back in 1894 when the central government’s debt was as low as kr. 168 million, equivalent to just under 1 per cent of GDP,\" the Nationalbank said.\nYou can see the history of Denmark's foreign debts below:\nDanmarks Nationalbank\nDenmark's central bank makes clear that Monday's news does not mean it is without any debt, just that all debt it has is now denominated in Danish currency.\nMore from Business Insider UK: The 10 countries were expats work the longest hours 10 things you need to know before European markets open 10 things in tech you need to know today (GOOG, FB, AAPL) 5 details you may have missed on Sunday's 'The Walking Dead' The 21 happiest countries in the world NOW WATCH: Robert Shiller on what a rate hike will do to asset prices and who Trump shouldn't put in charge of the fed Loading video...
