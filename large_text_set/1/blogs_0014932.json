From the very beginning, our mission has been to reach people on the channels and platforms where they already spend their time. This work began before President Obama took office in 2009, and, now, this work will continue. \nAs this Administration draws to a close, we wanted to share how you can continue to follow and engage with President Obama, the First Lady, and other Obama White House officials, as well as how you can find content posted over the past eight years after January 20, 2017. Moving forward, the President and First Lady can be followed on familiar handles: @BarackObama and @MichelleObama . \nIn October, we laid out plans to preserve and pass on the digital legacy of the Obama administration and have been working to ensure this unprecedented digital transition meets three key goals. First, we are preserving the material we’ve created with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Second, we are working to ensure these materials continue to be accessible on the platforms where they were created, allowing for continued access to the content posted over the past eight years. Finally, we are working to ensure that the next White House and future administrations can continue to use and develop the digital channels we have created to connect directly with the people they serve. \nWe are grateful to the people around the country and the world who have engaged with us online over the past eight years. We listened to you, we learned from you, and we strove to create opportunities for you to play an active role in your government by fulfilling the most important role in our government: the role of citizen. Digital assets that will remain with the White House \nWe are working to ensure that the next White House and future administrations can continue to use and develop the digital channels we have created to connect directly with the people they serve. The following assets will remain with the institution: Twitter (handle and followers, with no tweets on the timeline): @WhiteHouse , @POTUS , @VP , @FLOTUS , @PressSec , @LaCasaBlanca , @WHLive , @VPLive , @Cabinet Facebook (username and followers, with no posts on the timeline): Facebook.com/WhiteHouse , Facebook.com/whitehouse.espanol Instagram (handle and follower, with no posts on the timeline): Instagram.com/WhiteHouse Snapchat (username and followers): WhiteHouse ​YouTube (username and subscribers, with no videos): YouTube.com/WhiteHouse Medium (username and followers, with no posts): Medium.com/@WhiteHouse Tumblr (username and followers, with no posts): Tumblr.com/WhiteHouse Flickr (username and subscribers, with no photos): Flickr.com/WhiteHouse Where you can access archival Obama White House content \nAfter January 20, 2017, materials will continue to be accessible on the platforms where they were created, allowing the public continued access to the content posted over the past eight years. \nWhiteHouse.gov becomes ObamaWhiteHouse.gov The Obama White House website – which includes press articles, blog posts, videos, and photos – will be available at ObamaWhiteHouse.gov , a site maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), beginning on January 20, 2017. If you are looking for a post or page on the Obama administration’s WhiteHouse.gov from 2009 through 2017, you can find it by changing the URL to ObamaWhiteHouse.gov.
