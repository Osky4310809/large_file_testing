Honda HR-V to receive 1.0 litre turbo engine in China? / 6 comments \nThe Honda HR-V could receive a 1.0 litre turbocharged three-cylinder engine in China soon, according to a report by Autohome . \nThe new variant is said to be introduced by Guangqi Honda, featuring the same 1.0 litre turbo/CVT combo found in the Civic 180Turbo sold by Dongfeng Honda. On the sedan, the mill offers 123 hp at 5,500 rpm and 173 Nm from 2,000 to 4,500 rpm, driving the front wheels. \nCurrently, the HR-V is available with two naturally-aspirated four-cylinder petrol engines in 1.5 litre (118 hp/145 Nm) and 1.8 litre (140 hp/172 Nm) guises (the latter is the only option in Malaysia), with hybrid and diesel options as well. As you can tell, the turbocharged mill matches the 1.8 litre petrol mill in terms of torque, although it is down in the horsepower count. \nGuangqi Honda will reportedly launch the turbo HR-V on March 29 this year, with a few variants being offered to customers in China. Do you think such a model will be welcomed in Malaysia, given the lower road tax applicable?
