Zlatan Ibrahimovic was disappointed not to score against Watford on Saturday \nArsenal's Alexis Sanchez (No 3, up 63 places) is the only Gunner in the top 30 after scoring a controversial opening goal to break the deadlock against Hull and converting a last-minute penalty. \nManchester City's Gabriel Jesus held his No 6 spot this week despite only playing 15 minutes before being substituted through injury during City's 2-0 win at Bournemouth on Monday. \nThe Power Rankings methodology reflects a player's performance by awarding points to players for 32 different matchday stats. \nBelow, we present this week's Power Rankings, your club's top points scorer and the accumulative season rankings. \nThe Sky Sports Power Rankings will be updated every Tuesday during the season, so be sure to keep an eye on the big movers...
