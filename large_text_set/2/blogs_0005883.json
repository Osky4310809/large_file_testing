A short time later, another vehicle being driven by a 40-year-old Needham man slid on the ice and was unable to stop. \nFlynn was pinned between two cars and killed. \n“I honestly feel like I’m going to wake up and it wouldn’t have happened,” said Sheila Flynn, the elder Flynn’s wife. “Everything was perfect yesterday. The Patriots won. We celebrated with all our friends. These are the kind of things you read about but it doesn’t really happen.” Sheila and Joseph Flynn.

And then another accident occurs. It’s tragic.” \nResidents from the neighborhood said a curve in the road has made for dangerous driving conditions in the past. \nCrashes were reported throughout Greater Boston after freezing roads created hazardous conditions. A 55-car pileup was reported on Route 128 in Wakefield. \nWBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Lana Jones reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:28:06.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
