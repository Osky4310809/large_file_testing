This January, the company also completed an information grid project with the Israel Electric Corporation, enabling the company to optimize and further secure the management and control of its various systems, facilities and infrastructure.The New York Power Authority- mPrest partnership aims to reduce costs while ensuring that New York remains at the forefront of technological innovation, according to the companies. At the Niagara Power Plant, the mPrest software platform is analyzing information generated by sensors on the electrical transformers in order to automatically assess their operational health and predict potential malfunctions, the firms explained.“Our transformer system is a critical piece of our statewide power infrastructure, raising the voltage or ‘electrical pressure’ of power so that it can be transmitted long distance over the state’s grid,” said Gil C. Quiniones, New York Power Authority president and CEO.“Through our collaboration with mPrest, we can now accurately predict potential failures through better diagnostics and prognosis. As we actively pursue becoming the ‘first completely digital utility in the country,’ it is through cutting-edge technological innovation like this one, made possible with the intelligence, dedication and cooperation of our partners, that we have developed a unique, effective way of monitoring our transformers.” Relevant to your professional network?
