Hiddleston Talks Loki and Thor Reuniting \nWe know some things are to be expected in the upcoming Thor: Ragnarok , like an appearance of the MCU’s newest hero Doctor Strange and a Thor vs. Hulk gladiator fight, but what about the actual plot? Star Tom Hiddleston shed some light on the beginnings of the film and why Thor and Loki are teaming up once again, despite Loki’s betrayal in Thor: The Dark World . \n“At the beginning of Ragnarok, Thor has a lot of questions, and Loki, true to form, is not forthcoming with that many answers. But hammers are involved and the stakes are raised. Cate Blanchett, it’s no secret, is playing the goddess of death, who brings destruction in her wake and it is the kind of destruction that both Thor and Loki have never seen. On a scale of terror that they haven ever, ever seen before. So they fall back on their brotherhood, fractured though it is, to see what they can do to stop her.” \nHiddleston also spoke about Loki’s perceptions of Doctor Strange and Hella, saying: \n“I think he probably dismisses Strange. Yes his sorcerer is very impressive, but Loki has been doing that for centuries, so who cares? But Hella is a different beast, and full of surprises, and actually might have been someone with whom at one time he could have gotten along, but the circumstances have changed.” \nBrie Larson Shares Her Thoughts About the Captain Marvel Film \nWe’ve got three Marvel movies coming out in 2017, so the upcoming Captain Marvel film seems a bit far off in the distance. For fans of the character though, this is a big one. It’s the first female-fronted Marvel film, despite the fact that Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) was featured as a co-lead in Captain America: The Winter Soldier . There has been precious little information out there, including a director, however, we know that Academy Award-winner Brie Larson ( Room ) will play the lead. Larson spoke while on the press tour for Kong: Skull Island about expectations for the character. \nLarson told the site of her appearance in the film, “I can’t say anything… I feel like this is a big conversation and every day I have people yelling at me on Twitter like you better have long hair, or you better have a mohawk, or you better wear the helmet, or you better not wear the helmet, so someone’s going to be mad.” Fans are certainly passionate about getting the look of a character right and Captain Marvel has had more than one. \nLarson also discussed what the character means to her. She said, “I find it’s really hard for me to condense what she means to me. I was once a young girl and I was confused by what a hero was and what I wanted to be when I grow up and what was important to me. And so, I think it’s so complicated growing up and to attempt to become a symbol of truth and navigating through all the weird questions of growing up feels so, I’m getting emotional just talking about this, it feels so important to me. When it comes to her, I mean just the fact that she can be a bridge between two worlds, that she can go between Earth and space and that her own personal place is in this little area between where Earth ends and space begins and that’s only hers is so moving to me. I’m just inspired. I’ve been so inspired going through the comics and reading them right now. That’s what I’ve been doing on the side.” \nCars 3 NASCAR Cast Announced, Plus New Photos \nDisney•Pixar’s Cars 3 is teaming up with NASCAR this year as crowd favorite Lightning McQueen prepares to return to the big screen on June 16. Plans for the joint effort were shared by Cars 3 director Brian Fee, Cristela Alonzo — the voice of the film’s elite trainer Cruz Ramirez — and NASCAR’S vice president of entertainment marketing & content development Zane Stoddard today at the Daytona International Speedway in Florida as fans gear up for the DAYTONA 500 (live Feb. 26 at 2 p.m. ET on FOX). Owen Wilson, the voice of Lightning McQueen, will serve as grand marshal for the 59th annual “Great American Race.” Check out the new Cars 3 NASCAR cast photos plus a new still in the gallery at the link above! \nThe announcement included the introduction of NASCAR greats—from rookie drivers and legends to the voices behind the sport—tapped by Pixar Animation Studios to voice characters in the film. \n· CHASE ELLIOTT, 21, was named 2016’s Sunoco Rookie of the Year after finishing last season tenth in the driver standings. Elliott, who pilots the No. 24 car previously driven by four-time champion Jeff Gordon, lends his voice to second-generation Piston Cup racer CHASE RACELOTT in “Cars 3.” Racelott’s blend of skills, track smarts and top-of-the-line technology make this rookie a real contender. · RYAN BLANEY, a 23-year-old, third-generation racer, pilots the No. 21 Ford in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup series. He voices third-generation racer RYAN “INSIDE” LANEY in Cars 3 Known for his racing passion and ability to have fun on the track, Laney races with talent, speed and precision. · DANIEL SUÁREZ, who just turned 25, pilots the No. 19 ARRIS Toyota Camry in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. The 2016 NASCAR XFINITY Series champion can be heard in the film voicing DANNY SWERVEZ, a next-gen racer who’s ascending the Piston-Cup ladder against all odds. A mid-season replacement, Swervez is a quick learner who pushes himself to the limit. · BUBBA WALLACE, 23, won the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race at Martinsville Speedway in 2013, becoming the first African American to win in one of the top three touring divisions since Wendell Scott in 1963. In Cars 3 Wallace voices next-gen stock car racer BUBBA WHEELHOUSE, a fast and tenacious young racer who knows how to win. · DARRELL WALTRIP, the NASCAR Hall of Fame racer-turned-NASCAR on FOX color analyst lends his voice to DARRELL CARTRIP. Cartrip, a veteran Piston-Cup announcer also heard in Cars and Cars 2, may think he’s seen it all—but this new season might still have a surprise or two in store. · SHANNON SPAKE, NASCAR on FOX correspondent and college football and basketball reporter for FOX Sports, voices on-the-track reporter SHANNON SPOKES in the film. Spokes weaves her way into the middle of the action for in-the-moment interviews, and she’s not afraid to ask racers the tough questions. · HOWARD AUGUSTINE “HUMPY” WHEELER JR., the legendary NASCAR promoter and former president and GM of Charlotte Motor Speedway, lends his voice to iconic Dinoco team owner TEX DINOCO in Cars 3. Tex, who met Lightning McQueen in Cars would love nothing more than to see #95 decked out in Dinoco blue. · JEFF GORDON, four-time NASCAR champion, current NASCAR on FOX analyst, and story consultant for Cars 3, lends his voice to JEFF GORVETTE. Gorvette, whose number of top-ten finishes remains unmatched, may have hung up his racing tires—but his heart remains on the track. His ability to succeed at all levels turned hoods wherever he raced. · RICHARD “THE KING” PETTY, team owner and champion NASCAR driver with 200 wins, returns to the role of STRIP “THE KING” WEATHERS. From his humble beginnings on the Piston-Cup circuit to the glitzy sponsorship and media attention, the champion racer now serves as crew chief for his nephew, Cal Weathers. · KYLE PETTY, retired NASCAR driver and current NASCAR commentator on NBC, helps bring CAL WEATHERS to life in Cars 3. Weathers grew up around the track watching his uncle, Strip “The King” Weathers, tear it up. The veteran racer finds himself taking a step back to make room for the next generation on the track. · MIKE JOY is FOX Sports’ lead NASCAR announcer who will call his 38th DAYTONA 500 this Sunday. He lends his iconic voice to on-the-spot radio talk show host MIKE JOYRIDE in the movie. Joyride stays one step ahead in the racing news game by keeping a keen eye on where the racing season is headed. · RAY EVERNHAM, winner of three NASCAR championships as crew chief for Jeff Gordon and current consultant to Hendrick Motorsports, lends his voice to RAY REVERHAM, Jackson Storm’s crew chief, and an expert at training in the cutting edge technology and tactics being used by the next-gen racers. Evernham also serves as a story consultant for filmmakers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:28:33.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
