Can you spot her? Can you tell? Do you care? \nUnfortunately, many seem to care, and have responded with fear-mongering and vicious lies, trying to make this about the safety of our children. \nHonestly, they should be ashamed of themselves. \nAnyone who takes an authentic look at this knows there is no connection whatever between transgender people and pedophilia. Most predators are straight men who already have arranged their lives for easy access to children. \nThis is nothing new. We have been going to bathrooms with transgender people for as long as we have been alive. \nThose who stir up fear pretend it’s about the children when it’s really about fear, and power, and personal dislike of trans people. We have been through this before with left-handed people, women, blacks, interracial marriage. You would think we would have learned. \nSad. Truly. \nSo an entire group of people is being marginalized and oppressed and discriminated against, simply because we disagree with them, or just plain do not like them. Its called the “ick” factor. \nWho really needs protecting? The one who says “ick”?? \nThe truth is that when a transgender person goes   room, subject to harassment and attack—the stats bear that out. \nAnd the ones who may not be able to pass as easily as the women in the photos are in increased danger and in even more need of protection . \nSo, take a look again at those photos and tell me… When your son uses the restroom, would he be traumatized, upset, uncomfortable seeing any of these woman in the same restroom? Yeah, I think so. \nWhat is really the most disruptive? Letting them use the restroom that fits their lived identity or the one on their birth certificate? Because that’s the seedy underside of this debacle: to require the latter will bring more upheaval than we now imagine. \nI asked at the beginning if you could spot the transgender woman. Well, it’s not just one of these women who is transgender—it’s eight. All BUT one. \nWho is the cisgender woman? (The one who is NOT transgender?) \nI’m not going to tell you. \nBecause when you use a public restroom and see someone who reminds you of one of these lovely women, you won’t really know, will you? \nInstead, let me leave you with this advice… \nGo to the bathroom, wash your hands, and get on with your day. There is much life to live, much love to give. Focus your heart there. <3 \nWe have comprehensive video courses helping parents love, accept & affirm their LGBTQI children; helping LGBTQI heal shame from family, church and community; and helping those in the faith community be fully inclusive.
