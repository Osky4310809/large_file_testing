The mouthy mercenary slid into theaters in 2016 with a raunchy R-rated film that took the world by storm. With a sequel all but guaranteed, 20th Century Fox will officially get wheels turning on the second movie sometime this year. So far, reports have indicated the project would get underway in early May, but it seems the timetable for Deadpool 2 may have been pushed back yet again. \nThanks to Omega Underground , a production listing for Deadpool 2 has been spotted with revised dates. The Directors Guild of Canada published a new release which pushed back product more than a month. Instead of getting underway on May 1st, Deadpool 2 is now slated to enter production on June 19th. The listing also came complete with a wrap date which is set for September 18th. \nAnother production site connected with projects in Vancouver has also updated their site with similar dates. What’s Filming? has corroborated that Deadpool 2 is expected to film starting in mid-June. \nThis is the first time the Director’s Guild of Canada has commented on the film’s production schedule, so fans feel confident this latest release is a final one. While the sequel’s shooting plans haven’t altered greatly, it does give its creators more time to flesh out its contents. Last year, the film underwent a major blip when director Tim Miller exited the film over reported creative differences. David Leitch of John Wick fame came in to helm the film. \nJust last week, new reports surfaced about the script for Deadpool 2 which had fans worried. News broke that Drew Goddard became involved with scriptwriting, leading some to fear that Deadpool ’s original writers had left the film. However, Reynolds took to Twitter to publicly dismiss those claims. Fans are still waiting for official confirmation regarding casting of roles like Cable and Domino, but rumors continue to circulate about the coveted jobs. Right now, fans seem to believe Pierce Brosnan and Kerry Washington are top contenders for the roles. (Photo: 20th Century Fox ) \nSo, are you excited about Deadpool 2 ?
