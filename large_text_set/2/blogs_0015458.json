But Johnson was able to continue. \nThen, on Lap 50, Johnson got loose again at the exit to Turn 4 and crashed on his on, in an incident eerily similar to the ones that his Hendrick Motorsports teammates Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Chase Elliott had in last yearâ€™s Daytona 500. \nWith his car damaged, Johnson became a DNF, as teams can no longer re-enter the race once their cars go to the garage. \nJohnson was officially credited with a 16th-place finish in the 17-car race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T19:57:56.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
