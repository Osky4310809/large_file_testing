It could happen to anybody at any time,\" she told KARE 11. \nFirefighters and emergency medical responders were called to the store at around 5:30 p.m. when they attempted to revive Ryu. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. \nAfter his death, Jessica Cuevas, who said she's Ryu's aunt, set up a GoFundMe page with a goal of $11,000 for his funeral. \n\"Ryu was such a sweet boy, with a gorgeous smile, ... a unique little personality,\" the page reads, adding that his best friend was his \"older sister Glory.\" \nThe page set an initial goal of $11,000 for the funeral. As of Tuesday afternoon, the fundraiser had surpassed that goal by more than $2,000. \n\"He was just borrowed. You know, we just borrowed him for a little while â€” got to know him. He got to touch a lot of people,\" Gonzalez said. \nGonzalez and Cuevas did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. \nClifton said an investigation into Ryu's death is ongoing.
