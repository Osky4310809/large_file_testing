There’s no word on who will play the sharp-fanged villain, but screenwriters Scott Rosenberg (High Fidelity) and Jeff Pinkner ( The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ) will write the script. The film will be released on 5 October. Six reasons not to write off Drew Goddard's Spider-Man v Sinister Six movie Read more \nVenom first appeared in the Spider-Man comics in 1988. An alien symbiote , the creature requires a human host to survive. The character was initially conceived as a supervillain but has since become an antihero in the manner of Deadpool, who appeared in his own film adaptation in 2016. \nA Venom movie has long been rumoured. In 2008, Variety reported that a spin-off was in development, with Gary Ross ( The Hunger Games ) in talks to direct. However, the project stalled. Sony, which now owns the film rights to the Spider-Man franchise, is said to be keen to expand the Spider-Man universe in the same way that Marvel has with The Avengers . Sony has also been interested in making a film featuring a collection of Spider-Man villains in the manner of Suicide Squad . \nMeanwhile, Sony is refreshing Spider-Man himself. This summer will see the release of Spider-Man Homecoming , a new reboot starring Tom Holland that will focus on the superhero’s high-school years. Holland is the third actor to don Spider-Man’s red and blue costume in recent years, after Tobey Maguire, who played him in a trilogy of films between 2002-2007, and Andrew Garfield, who appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). \nVenom has appeared in film before. He was the primary antagonist in Spider-Man 3 and made a brief cameo in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.
