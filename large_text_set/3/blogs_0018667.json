Stay out of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well.” \nBeck addressed the situation on his radio show Monday, calling it a “dustup.” \n“I don’t hire people who are sycophants or don’t have my opinion. I try to hire people who have a different opinion because I believe in being intellectually rigorous. I don’t want strawmen. I want people to have a real argument on the other side so we can learn from each other, and we can grow,” he said.

What is the constitutional argument for conservatives on life? A lot of people will think that this is a new argument. That founders never — they never discussed this, you know? Abortion is a new idea. And if it’s not abortion, women’s rights is a new idea. Well, I want you to put women’s rights into context here. Women’s rights are important, however, they’re not the only thing to consider when another person’s life is at stake. We have to — we have to consider the other person’s life when it is at stake.” \nBeck went on to say that he “would disagree that you’re a hypocrite if you want limited government and yet you want the government to protect life of the unborn.” \n“It’s very, very clear. But it takes intellectual honesty, and it takes a willingness to actually think these things through and to do more than just read Twitter or Facebook to get your news and your political opinions,” Beck said. “Speech is not free. It comes with another cost and usually to the other people at the other end of your argument. The pen is mightier than the sword, and it can destroy people if your aim is clicks, views, and ratings… For Tomi, this seems to be a relatively recent change.” 10 Women Who Have Left Fox News Shows, From Megyn Kelly to Laurie Dhue (Photos) \nFox News has enhanced the careers of numerous women who have served as hosts. All were hired by Roger Ailes, the former network boss who exited in August amid a sexual harassment scandal. \nGreta Van Susteren -- who had been one of Ailes' most stalwart defenders -- left in early September after saying that Fox had \"not felt like a home\" for years. \nLaurie Dhue was a familiar presence on Fox in the early 2000s but left the network in 2008. She has reportedly been shopping a tell-all book this year. \nOutspoken host Elisabeth Hasselbeck left \"The View\" to join \"Fox & Friends\" in 2013, which she exited at the end of 2015. \nAndrea Tantaros, former co-host of \"The Five,\" filed a lawsuit saying that Fox News operated like a \"sex-fueled, Playboy-Mansion-like cult.\" \nAlisyn Camerota hosted a number of Fox News programs during a 16-year run that ended in 2014. She now hosts \"New Day\" on CNN. \nRudi Bakhtiar jumped from CNN to Fox News in 2006. She claimed she was sexually harassed by correspondent Brian Wilson and later spoke out against Fox News' culture after the Ailes scandal broke. She now works at Reuters. \nKiran Chetry was a Fox News host from 2001 to 2007. She was reportedly also an aspirant for a role on \"Fox & Friends,\" the network's morning show. \nLibertarian commentator Jedediah Bila appeared on Fox's \"Outnumbered\" and later turned up on ABC's \"The View.\" \nHer lawsuit started it all: Former Fox host Gretchen Carlson claims Ailes repeatedly sexually harassed her. Her suit was later settled for a reported $20 million. \nMegyn Kelly ended her 12 year run with Fox News in exchange for a weekday show at NBC. She turned down a four-year, $100 million offer to stay with Fox News saying that one of the reasons for her departure was to spend more time with her kids. Kelly said she was among those at Fox News sexually harassed by Ailes . \nEnjoy this gallery?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:12:52.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
