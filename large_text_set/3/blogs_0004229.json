An article from an AP reporter based out of the Indianapolis bureau detailed the records and included both the AOL addresses used by the Pences. \nPaoletta said in his letter that the reporter who published the story told Pence’s press secretary that he did not know that Karen Pence was still using the email address. But when asked to revise the article to redact the email address, Paoletta said that the wire service refused to do so. \n“Your organization was unwilling to retract the story, issue a correction, or even redact the e-mail from the story,” he wrote, adding that “there was absolutely no reason to publish this private email address, and you should be ashamed of your reprehensible conduct.” \n“Your organization should apologize to Mrs. Pence for violating her privacy,” the lawyer concluded. When we requested they take it down, they refused. The @AP owes my wife an apology. pic.twitter.com/LdMmnewnWF", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:19:59.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
