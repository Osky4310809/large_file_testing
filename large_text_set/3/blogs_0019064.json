Got something on your mind? . Today, we’re covering weed, highlighters, Little Debbies, and more. Advertisement \nI had an annoying dream the other night where I was in an airport and missed a flight. I woke up, shook it off, and then went right back to sleep. And you know what happened? The dream CONTINUED. I shut my eyes and was right back with the fucking gate agent. You know how many times I’ve tried to keep a sex dream going, only to fail? And THIS is the fucking dream where I finally manage to achieve continuity? I’m livid. This is horseshit. I’m donating this stupid brain. \nOkay, time for your letters: Advertisement \nAdam: \nCan I get a ranked list of knives? I go straight past the butter and steak knives and choose the biggest we had (obviously), to great endangerment of my fingers. You know, the kind a serial killer in a slasher movie would use. A “That’s not a knife, THIS is a knife” knife, and all. Is a Bowie #1 on name recognition alone, or Swiss Army? \nI had a Swiss Army knife when I was a kid, and the dirty secret of Swiss Army knives is that they’re useless, apart from showing yours off to other kids (“Dude, check it out: TWEEZERS”). The knives are dull. The scissors could barely snip a hangnail. The corkscrew was famously unnecessary to tweens. And unless you’re fastidious about cleaning it (thirteen-year-old me was not), the whole thing rusts in place after roughly two weeks. One time I used the fish scraper and that pretty much ended the knife as a whole. This is why TRUE MACGYVERS carry a Leatherman around instead of a stupid toy. \nAnyway, I digress. You wanted a ranking of knives, so let’s get to it. Now, you could really blow out this list to include all blades, including swords and saws and machetes and scythes and all kinds of other cool shit. But I think it would be better just to pare it down to basic knives you use every day, either for cooking or general handiwork. Let’s go: Sponsored \n1. Chef’s knife. I don’t own one of those fancy chef’s knives that has Japanese lettering on it and comes wrapped in a velvet cloth, but ONE DAY, by God. One day I will go to the local knifemonger and pick out some 18” behemoth that can skin a whale. Big cooking knives are great for chopping because they’re nice and sharp, and they put less strain on your hands and wrist, and they look like a Norman Bates murder weapon. I have a shitty chef’s knife from Ikea that cost $8 and I wield it like I’m a goddamn samurai. \n2. Hunting knife. This is the one that comes in the leather holster with the little snap button, like you’re undoing a onesie before you set about field-dressing a dead moose. I want a knife like this specifically so that I can stand inside a very cold cabin and eat summer sausage with it, like Sean Connery does in The Untouchables . That’s good eatin’. Advertisement \n3. Steak knives. They come in their own case! That always kills me. When it’s Steak Night, I get to bust out the knives like they’re the crown jewels. They should really make steak knives the official male engagement gift. She gets a ring. You get an 8-piece box of pure American Carnage. My mom has these steak knives with bone handles. I still don’t know what kind of bones they are. Dinosaur? Shark? Human? Rabbit? Regardless, it feels good to be holding a knife possibly carved from the very animal you’re about to eat. Insult to injury, really. \n4. Switchblade. Never stops being fun to push that button. Still more fun than a butterfly knife, which is only cool if you have fancy butterfly knife moves. Every school has at least one weird kid who knows how to properly use nunchuks and butterfly knives and is somehow even less cool because of it. \n5. Poultry shears. They’re so, so useful, and you get to cut through chicken ribs like they’re construction paper. Murder has never felt so effortless. They come with every knife set for a reason, you know. Advertisement \nBy the way, it’s supposedly bad luck to give people knives as gifts (unless, according to superstition, you tape a penny to the knife and then give the penny to the giver to ward off the zombies). One of my friends did not get the memo about this, and gave me knives for my wedding. We still have them, and nothing bad has happened yet! \n[flying circular saw disc comes out and slices my head clean off] \n6. Santoku knife. This is a knife with a rounded tip and a razor sharp edge, with little indentations along the blade so that whatever you’re cutting falls off easily (like potatoes, which stick to everything). They are cool. Advertisement Advertisement \n7. Paring knife. Good for slicing apples and jabbing would-be robbers with lethal efficiency. If you break into my joint, I will grab the littlest paring knife and then poke holes in you like I’m gonna keep a pet frog inside your body. \n8. Dinner knife. Honestly, the steak knife should just be the dinner knife. The only reason it isn’t is because the kids would butcher each other with them. B I want my bone knife when I’m digging into this Salisbury steak. \n9. Butter knife. Whatever. Who gives a shit. Advertisement \n10. Bread knife. You are 50 times more likely to inflict a horrible injury upon your extremities with this knife than any other knife. If the bread is even a little stale, a shitty bread knife will slide right off and then take your index finger with no remorse. It sucks. Good for cutting tomatoes, though. \n11. Fish knife. Fucking worthless. There’s nothing a fish knife can do that a fork can’t readily accomplish. \nAdvertisement \nAaron: \nDifferent types of weed are all bullshit, right? I mean, sure there’s dirt and good stuff - but when people start talking about indica vs sativa I want dump out the bong and waterboard them. It reminds me of people who could allegedly differentiate between Beast Light and Natty Light in college. \nNo, different types of weed really ARE different, although I wouldn’t know quite how because A) I don’t smoke often enough and B) I will smoke weed however it comes. I don’t give a crap if it has seeds in it or anything. If you’re like, “Here’s a joint,” I won’t turn it down. I am a whore. \nAlso, I’ve had bad highs, where I’m all paranoid and shit, and good highs, where I feel like I’m floating inside a balloon. I dunno if that was because of the weed, or the environment in which I was smoking it, but the difference can be stark. When I went to buy legal weed in Colorado (so cool!), I specifically asked the lady at the dispensary for the Do Stuff weed, and not the Sit There And Stare At The Fucking Wall weed. And the weed she gave me was spot on. I was eminently functional in between bouts of furious masturbation. I wasn’t a drooling moron. Advertisement \nI think weed is like wine, where people who are really into it can glean subtle differences between each strain and, on occasion, delude themselves into exaggerating the “notes” to the high. And I’m sure some bad shit is overpriced and some good shit is underpriced. All I know is that good weed should make you feel good. Don’t steal that. I’m making that the slogan of my retirement pot farm. \nAdvertisement Advertisement \nGiri wrote an article about how it’s okay that Tebow was eating guacamole straight with a spoon. Can we have a ruling here? I think Giri is nuts. \nAs someone who will eat the Sabra hummus right out of the container like a dipshit, I don’t have much of a right to judge… BUT I don’t think it’s optimal. Salsa tastes fine on its own, but you’d still rather have some chips, right? The chips help make it. Same with guacamole. Like, I’ll eat it plain (which I think people do strictly for health reasons), but no one thinks it’s BETTER that way than served with a big fucking basket of warm cantina chips. That’s dumb. \nAnd I know a lot of people now like having avocado straight up, like as a quick lunch. BIG AVOCADO has hacked directly into the lunch mainframe of every living Californian. You halve one, then drizzle some oil and lemon juice on it, and then add salt and pepper. It’s good, but it would still be better tucked inside a pork fat taco. I am under no illusions.

I assume Suleiman the Magnificent or Moctezuma II would not have been impressed, but a fat English guy? Heads would have rolled until he sat on a throne of those fuckers. \nYeah, he would demand to know the source of the Fudge Rounds, and then behead you for not having a useful answer. Chocolate was one of many New World commodities like cinnamon, pepper, and gold that got olde-timey European rulers rock hard. And given that Henry VIII lived before chocolate was introduced to the continent, he’d shit his dick if you gave him chocolate in its sweetest, most palatable form. Then history would proceed as normal. Advertisement Advertisement \nIf I were a time traveler presenting the Little Debbies to him, I would be forced to lie. I would tell him that the fudge comes from THE ORIENT, and is guarded by a big dragon, and that I would need 100,000 guineas (and a set of steak knives) to amass a fleet of ships and stout crew to go to Fudge Mountain and claim it in the name of England. Then I would pocket Fatty’s gold and flee to Italy. I assume nothing would go wrong with this plan. \nI’m not gonna rank Little Debbie cakes today, but I just wanted to end this answer with a shout-out to Oatmeal Cream Pies, Swiss Cake Rolls, and Star Crunch. All of those are worth fighting wars over. A Star Crunch is evil wrapped in cellophane. \nAdvertisement \nNate: \nI got a letterman jacket in high school because I was a semi-decent athlete and it was the cool thing to do and whatnot. But that was nine years ago and I haven’t worn my letterman jacket in, well, nine years. I can’t really give it away because it is personalized, but I can’t wear it anymore because I don’t want to be that guy who tries to relive his high school glory days. For now, it lives in a closet at my parents’ house and sometimes when I am there I take it out and look at it. What does one do with an old letterman jacket? \nI think you’ve actually handled it correctly. If I had a letterman jacket (I never got one…), I would NEVER throw it away. I earned that shit (or, in this alternate dimension, I would have). I would keep it and secretly cherish it like a gold medal, or any other personal sports memento. I have flag football title t-shirts I still prize like back issues of Superman #1. I’d frame that goddamn jacket. I bet 50 percent of all old men who still have a varsity letter jacket put it on while naked and then browse old Facebook photos. \nBy the way, I rarely see high school students in my area rocking letter jackets. I’m sure they’re still huge in, like, Texas. But they seem to be anachronisms in other areas, phased out in favor of team-specific shell jackets and other swag. I think, if I were 18, I’d still want the proper letter jacket. I WANT TO FEEL LIKE A BIG MAN. Advertisement \n\nJJ: \nI have a colleague who frequently uses a highlighter. However, he doesn’t highlight the important words - he circles the phrase or sentence with the highlighter instead. He’s insane, correct? \nYeah, he’s a moron. And you know what? You never need a highlighter anyway. I remember in school when kids would highlight half the fucking book. What a bunch of suck-ups. They weren’t retaining jack shit. If there’s an important passage in something, just note it in the margin. You don’t have to go fastidiously tracing over the text like a weirdo. I can barely highlight in a straight line anyway. The only reason people use highlighters is to show off all the shit they’ve highlighted. Advertisement \nAlso, the highlighter is the only pen in the pen drawer that ever has any ink left in it.
