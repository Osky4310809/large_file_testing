and bilateral trade issues. 19 Mar 2017 06:49 GMT Asia Pacific , China , United States , North Korea , Nuclear weapons Chinese President Xi Jinping and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met in Beijing on Sunday [Thomas Peter/Reuters] \nChinese President Xi Jinping and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have met in Beijing and sent out a message that they would work to strengthen ties between their countries. \nXi stressed, after the meeting on Sunday, that he and US President Donald Trump had resolved in a phone call last month \"that we need to make joint efforts to advance China-US cooperation and we believe that we can make sure the relationship will move ahead in a constructive fashion in the new era\". \nHe added: \"I'm confident that as long as we can do this, the relationship can surely move in the right direction.\" \nAl Jazeera's Adrian Brown, reporting from Beijing on Sunday, said Tillerson's meeting with Xi was a courtesy call that only lasted seven minutes. \n\"President Xi Jinping was receiving the US secretary of state because China's top envoy was in Washington last month where he met President Donald Trump,\" he said. \n\"The real talking was done behind the scenes on Saturday, principally with China's foreign minister Wang Yi, and North Korea topped the agenda. \n\"We've seen flickers of cooperation between the US and China but no firm agreement on how to deal with North Korea.\" First visit \nIn his first first face-to-face talks with Chinese leaders, TIllerson pledged to work together in addressing the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear programme and warned that regional tensions had reached a \"dangerous level\". \nThe language from Tillerson and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi was notably conciliatory after a run-up in which President Trump accused China of doing nothing to control its rogue neighbour, while Beijing blamed Washington for fuelling hostilities. \n\"I think we share a common view and a sense that tensions in the peninsula are quite high right now and that things have reached a rather dangerous level,\" Tillerson said after talks with Wang. \n\"We will work together to see if we cannot bring the government in Pyongyang to a place where they want to make a different course, make a course correction, and move away from the development of nuclear weapons.\" Asia tour presents challenges for Tillerson \nSpeaking to Al Jazeera from Beijing, Victor Gao, director of the China National Association of International Studies, said: \"US-China trade right now is worth almost $600bn and it is a fact that China has a huge surplus in the trade with the US.\" \n\"What China wants to see is that, rather than getting at each other's throat, both China and the US further increase their export, to each other, eventually reaching about $1 trillion,\" he said. \nTillerson, a former oil executive, began his first Asian visit as secretary of state in Japan on Wednesday followed by South Korea. He travelled to China from South Korea on Saturday. \nPreviously, Tillerson had said in Tokyo that 20 years of diplomatic and other efforts, including a period when the US provided North Korea with $1.35bn in assistance \"to take a different pathway\", had come to nothing. \nHe said South Korea that US military action against North Korea is an \"option on the table\", and warned the country to end its missile and nuclear programmes. \nThe US has been pressing China to do more to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes, including imposing tougher sanctions on North Korea. \nHowever, China has been angered by the deployment of a US missile defence system to the South. \nChina says the system's radar is a threat to its security. Rex Tillerson on North Korea: ‘All options on the table’ \nNorth Korea has a long-standing ambition to become a nuclear power and conducted its first underground atomic test in 2006, in the teeth of global opposition. \nWhile Tillerson was holding meetings in China on Saturday, Pyongyany announced that it conducted a ground test of a new type of high-thrust rocket engine that leader Kim Jong-un is calling a revolutionary breakthrough for the country's space programme. \nThe country has continued to defy the international community for years, even after two rounds of UN-backed sanctions. It has conducted two nuclear tests and a series of missile launches since the beginning of last year. \nNorth Korea recently launched four more ballistic missiles and is working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the US.
