She's criticized the Black Lives Matter movement (going so far as to compare it to the KKK ), Beyoncé's powerful Super Bowl performance , and abortion , which she called \"murdering a fetus\" just three months ago. But last week she went on The View and declared herself pro-choice. Lahren advocates for the stance on the basis of \" limited government \", not say, a woman's right to choose—but even so, this seemingly female-friendly stance got her suspended from her own TV show on Glenn Beck's conservative news network, The Blaze. \"I'm pro choice, and here's why: I am a constitutional, you know, someone that loves the Constitution,\" the 24-year-old said. \"I'm someone that's for limited government. So I can't sit here and be a hypocrite and say I'm for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies. I can sit here and say that, as a Republican and I can say, you know what, I'm for limited government, so stay out of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well.\" You May Also Like Lifestyle Fitness Blogger Amanda Bucci Apologizes for Her ‘Bad Angle’ in Side-by-Side Photo Unsurprisingly, a lot of Lahren's far-right wing fans were not pleased about the pundit's stance on abortion, with some going so far as to call for a boycott on Twitter. Following the backlash, Tomi was mysteriously suspended—at least for the week. According to CNN Money , the show's managing editor confirmed that it wouldn't be in production this week, but when asked about the matter directly, Lahren said only, \"Wish I could comment but I can’t.\" As for our stance here? It's more than disheartening that racism and discrimination are viable beliefs on The Blaze, but women's advocacy, in any form, is a suspendible offense.
