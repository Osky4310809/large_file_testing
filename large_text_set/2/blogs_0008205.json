Johnson will play an animal-loving hero who aims to put a stop to the destruction. \nWhile it's unclear whether or not Manganiello will be a hero or villain, the report did mention a small detail about his character. The actor will portray the leader of a private military group. This could set Manganiello up to be somewhat of an antagonist, as the role sounds a lot like Vincent D'Onofrio's character in Jurassic World. \nBoth actors are currently joining the ranks of the DC Extended Universe, after being cast in major comic roles. Manganiello will be playing Deathstroke, while Johnson will be portraying Black Adam. \nIt's possible that their collaboration in Rapmage could lead to some scenes together in the DC films, but that remains to be seen. \nMarley Shelton is also in talks to take a role in the film. The Pleasantville and Planet Terror actress will reportedly play a scientist and astronaut. \nThe two actors join Johnson and Oscar-nominee Naomie Harris as the only performers in the film so far. \nRampage is slated for release on April 20, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:05:01.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
