When the giant animal felt it had urged the group far enough (or when it just ran out of steam), the high-speed chase turned into a low-speed one, with the elephant eventually abandoning the effort and returning home. \nThe six-minute video is a testament to the elephant’s tenacity, endurance, and impatience when it comes to strangers barging in on its turf. \nSo take note: when the elephant you’re photographing starts to head your way, it’s a good indicator you’ve outstayed your welcome. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:43:22.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
