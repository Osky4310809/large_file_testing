UPDATE: Condition of man shot at UW protest improves from critical to serious, breathing on his own after surgery. https://t.co/ZOSbbsH2Ge pic.twitter.com/SdhUzHGtWV \n— The Seattle Times (@seattletimes) January 23, 2017 \nThe shooter claimed that the 34-year-old victim was a white supremacist and he had shot him in self-defense. The victim’s friends told the Seattle Times that the description couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, they claim, he’s an avowed anti-fascist who “has always been of the mind to be compassionate, empathetic and to educate” and who has “an anti-hate tattoo that consists of a black swastika surrounded by a red circle with a slash through it.” They said he was a Bernie Sanders supporter. \nThe shooter — described as an Asian man in a leather jacket and maroon shirt, according to Hatewatch — was released from police custody after claiming he had acted in self-defense. The victim underwent surgery today and is now in serious condition. \nHatewatch reports that eyewitnesses made the following observations: \nThe shooter was a Trump-supporting man who had been acting as a provocateur in the crowd all night, while the victim was an anti-fascist liberal who had been acting as a peacekeeper in the moments before he was shot. \nAfter being informed that someone was shot outside of his event, Yiannopoulos said, “If we don’t continue, they have won … If I stopped my event now, we are sending a clear message that they can stop our events by killing people. I am not prepared to do that.” \n[image: screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:18:19.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
