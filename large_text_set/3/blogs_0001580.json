Still, the situation was destined to be a bit awkward, especially considering that one of the parties involved is actually a talking candelabra. \nThat first meeting is the subject of Disney 's newest clip from their live-action Beauty and the Beast (which is currently at a 3.23 out of 5 on ComicBook.com's anticipation rankings ). Not to be left out though is Cogsworth, who Belle also meets for the first time. Seeing a clock and a candelabra argue with someone has to be a bit surreal, even if you just encountered a walking talking Beast. \nThe clip debuted on \"The Oh My Disney Show\" with host Alexys Gabrielle. In addition to the above clip, the first episode featured Auli'l Carvalho (Moana) after her Oscars performance with Lin-Manuel Miranda, a sneak peek inside Disney's Main Street Electrical Parade, and trivia and a dance off with Liv and Maddie's Joey Bragg. You can find more on their YouTube channel . \nMake sure to check out some new images from the aforementioned scene and the first episode of Oh My Disney in the gallery. \nBeauty and the Beast is the fantastic journey of Belle, a bright, beautiful and independent young woman who is taken prisoner by a beast in his castle. Despite her fears, she befriends the castle’s enchanted staff and learns to look beyond the Beast’s hideous exterior and realize the kind heart and soul of the true Prince within. \nBeauty and the Beast stars Emma Watson as Belle; Dan Stevens as the Beast; Luke Evans as Gaston, the handsome, but shallow villager who woos Belle; Oscar winner Kevin Kline as Maurice, Belles eccentric, but lovable father; Josh Gad as Lefou, Gaston’s long-suffering aide-de-camp; Golden Globe nominee Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, the candelabra; Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza, the harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette, the feather duster; six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe, the wardrobe; Oscar nominee Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, the mantel clock; and two-time Academy Award winner Emma Thompson as the teapot, Mrs. Potts \nBeauty and the Beast will be released in U.S. theaters on March 17, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:43:52.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
