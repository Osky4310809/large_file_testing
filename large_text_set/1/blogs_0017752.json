His interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on weather prediction in 1961. \nWhat's needed here is careful study devoid of vested interests, you know, REAL science that's not funded by those who would benefit from the outcome of their 'research'. \nThe climate will change, so preparing for it would seem to be a good idea.
