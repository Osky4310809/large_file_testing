The former Bachelor appeared in Wednesday’s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show with his fiancée, Vanessa Grimaldi, and his Dancing With the Stars partner, Peta Murgatroyd. Host DeGeneres was quick to ask the new couple about their mannerisms during the After the Final Rose interview special. WATCH: EXCLUSIVE: Peta Murgatroyd and Nick Viall Get Candid About Double Dating and the 'Great Energy' on 'DWTS' “I didn’t see the After the Rose because I could not commit to 4 hours of television. I heard that some people thought it was awkward, that y’all were awkward together,” DeGeneres said. While Viall didn’t directly respond to those comments, Grimaldi did chime in, saying, “I didn’t think so. I think we both went in it wanting to be honest and open about couples, you know, sometimes things can get tough. But we’re very committed to each other, we love each other, and that’s what we’re focusing on.” Viall is also focused on his current competition, which has already proven to be more difficult than he anticipated. “Most positions that Peta asks me to do are painful physically,” he quipped. “It’s very hard but she’s very patient with me.” Murgatroyd is proud of her partner’s hard work, adding, “He hasn’t performed at all. Most of the people on this season have actually got performance experience so it’s a really tough season.” The seasoned dancer is also facing a challenge of her own, getting back to work less than 10 weeks after welcoming her first child. A post shared by Nick Viall (@nickviall) on Mar 19, 2017 at 4:13pm PDT “I think it’s good for mothers to get back out there and keep doing what they love to do,” she insisted, but added, “I’m exhausted, to be honest with you, I am so tired, between feeding every four hours, racing home.” Lightheartedly pointing to her chest, Murgatroyd noted, “I have to tape these things down.” “Do you try not to do bouncy dances?” DeGeneres quipped. “I directly asked for no Jive first week,” the DWTS star admitted.
