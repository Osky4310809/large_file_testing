Ed stopped by to talk with the BBC about the 10 versions of his new album that existed before this final one, and how each song on the album has significant meaning to him. I s Taylor on the album , though? Nope! And he knows why…\nOf course Ed Sheeran knows some of the most coveted music gossip there is to tell. Who wouldn’t trust that smile? Kevin Mazur / WireImage / Getty Images After rumors were sparked that a collab was underway by a certain someone’s Instagram shot months ago , we were surprised to learn of an absence of Taylor on Ed’s major new record.\nJust like old times @teddysphotos !! \nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Jul 5, 2016 at 2:41pm PDT \nBut Ed has confirmed why:\n“Taylor [Swift] isn’t going to be releasing until probably the end of this year. Christmas is the smartest time to release because that’s when everyone buys records.” Taylor has never been shy about performing strategically in this business; remember her Superbowl Saturday concert in Houston that was nearly bigger than the Superbowl itself? She’s a boss through and through, and if she’s sitting on our new favorite record until its most opportune release date, we are not surprised. Taylor knows what’s up.\nThanks Houston And @versace_official for making this outfit situation @gettyentertainment \nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Feb 4, 2017 at 11:55pm PST \nBesides, Ed added a very important point. Without any new music from Taylor till next winter, we’re in for, in his words, “a full year of just all Ed, all the time.”\nNEW SONG - Eraser (live) (Extended F64 Version) youtube.com/sbtv \nA post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos) on Feb 28, 2017 at 9:09am PST \nWe’ll take it!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:35:32.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
