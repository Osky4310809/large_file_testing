Police \nAccording to the arrest documents, a second victim living under his roof also claims Perez showed her his genitals while she was cooking mashed potatoes for him in their kitchen. \nThe reports say the woman was so frightened upon his sexual exposure that she ran into her bedroom, locked the door and called her parents, begging them to place her with a different host family. \nIt’s been reported both women were staying with Perez and his girlfriend at the time of the assault. His girlfriend was acting as their host mom. \nInvestigators claim the duo lived in the Valencia Forest Apartments on Valencia Town Trail in Orlando, Florida when the harassment occurred. \nHis girlfriend — who remains unnamed — allegedly helped deputies catch Perez in the act of admitting to his sexual assault. Google Maps \nThe host mom allowed police to listen in on a phone call between her and her boyfriend. During the conversation, Perez admitted to the sexual encounters with one of the students. \nHowever, he claimed the sex acts were consensual. \nThe Orlando host dad also confirmed he “accidentally” exposed himself to the other female foreign exchange student who called her family in a state of terror. \nSeeing that the reports did not state Perez was charged with sexually abusing a child, it’s clear both woman were 18. \nApparently, they were placed into his Orange County home by an agency in Vietnam. \nOn Tuesday night, Perez was released from Orange County Jail after posting a $5,100 bail.
