These companies range from a VR animation studio to water monitoring sensors for your appliances – signaling that NEXT will stay pretty broad with its investments. \nSamsung NEXT , the division leading the fund, used to be called the Samsung Global Innovation Center. The division within Samsung is responsible for identifying promising new technologies and startups that could benefit Samsung in the future. \nNEXT also today announced a new office in Tel Aviv – they currently have locations in Mountain View, New York, San Francisco and Korea.
