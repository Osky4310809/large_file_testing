The eight-wicket win came in the first session of fourth day’s play is a clear indicator of India’s dominance in the match. But the series will be remembered more for its share of controversies around Australian captain Steve Smith. After the ‘brain fade’ episode in the second test, Smith was embroiled in another controversy in the last test where he was caught by TV cameras saying ‘f……g cheat’. This happened after the third umpire ruled not-out in favour of Josh Hazelwood against India’s appeal of a catch by Murali Vijay in the second innings.\nSteven Smith Captain of Australia reacts during day four of the fourth test match between India and Australia held at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium on the 28th March 2017.

The incident happened on the third day of the fourth test at Dharamsala when Australia were about to be bowled out for a small score in their second innings . As Australian batting coach Graeme Hick pointed out that it is not easy to be absolutely sure if a slip fielder has taken a clean catch. In such a case, the batsman always has recourse to ask for a referral (DRS), which they did. No doubt Vijay should have waited for the final decision before running away towards the pavilion to pad up for batting, but that doesn’t give anyone the license to brand the player as a ‘cheat’.\n#IndvAus #DharamsalaTest – Did Steve Smith abuse Murali Vijay? https://t.co/WnKD3GtOjj pic.twitter.com/juHtczOLVo\n— TOI Sports (@toisports) March 27, 2017\nThe irony is not lost especially when one considers that Smith could be clearly seen taking help of his teammates in the dressing room for a DRS during the second test in Bengaluru. Smith had then taken refuge under the term ‘brain fade’ later but the damage was done. Indian skipper Virat Kohli had claimed he had seen Aussies look towards the dressing room before asking for DRS earlier as well. This has taken the sheen off Smith who ended the series as the highest run-getter on either side with 499 runs including three centuries.\n#IndvAus Australian cricketers are no longer friends, says @imVkohli https://t.co/B7nBINl5pR pic.twitter.com/KY2qXrqOxp\n— TOI Sports (@toisports) March 28, 2017\nThe most telling comment came from the legendary Sunil Gavaskar who has chosen to put some facts out in the public domain about Australia’s usage of DRS in the recent past . Before the brain fade controversy, Aussies had got seven out of 16 referrals right but have managed to get only one out of 12 referrals right after that. Perhaps Australians need to introspect on their holier-than-thou attitude before making wild allegations at others.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/DharamsalaTest?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/imVkohli", "https://t.co/B7nBINl5pR", "https://twitter.com/toisports/status/846634783811743745", "https://t.co/WnKD3GtOjj", "https://twitter.com/toisports/status/846380670536568833", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndvAus?src=hash", "http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-australia-2016-17/engine/match/1062576.html", "https://t.co/KY2qXrqOxp", "https://t.co/juHtczOLVo"], "published": "2017-03-28T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:17:19.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
