The Neilson Company reports that the 2017 Academy Awards had the lowest viewership since 2008 with 32.9 million viewers.\nThe tepid 89th Annual Oscars was hosted by comedian Jimmy Kimmel and only received a market rating of 21.4/37, markedly down from last year's numbers, which were the lowest in eight years.\nThe extravagant awards show was tarnished due to a mix-up with the Best Picture announcement.\nPresenters Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty erroneously proclaimed La La Land as the winner for Best Picture after receiving the wrong envelope. However, the real winner was eventually revealed to be Moonlight , reports Reuters.\nMany celebrities also voiced opposition to President Donald Trump, turning the event into a political spectacle rather than entertainment for the masses, according to Daily Mail.\nHost Jimmy Kimmel made a few jokes at Trump's expense, and even said he would not be attending the White House Correspondents' Dinner.\nKimmel started his speech by saying, \"This broadcast is being watched by millions of Americans and around the world by more than 225 countries that now hate us and I think that is an amazing thing. As you know, I don't have to tell anybody, the country is divided right now.\n\"Some of you will get to come up on this stage tonight and give a speech that the President of the United States will tweet about in all caps during his 5am bowel movement tomorrow. And I think that’s pretty darn excellent if you ask me, so let’s get going.\"\nMeanwhile Iranian director Asghar Farhadi said he would not be not attending the Oscars in protest against Trump's immigration ban.\nA statement was read on behalf of Farhadi when he won the best foreign film Oscar for The Salesman.\nThe statement read: \"I'm sorry I'm not with you tonight. My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and the other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S.\"\nConversely, Trump supporters vowed to boycott the Academy Awards in demonstration against the \"limousine liberals\" who don't represent them.\nThe boycott was started by a Facebook page from Arizona women's group \"Tempe Republican Women,\" imploring followers to vote with their remotes and turn off the Oscars.\n\"It is important that we, the deplorables, show the likes of Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Alec Baldwin, Cher ... that we, the backbone and decent people of America, are more united than the bitter, unhappy, angry, divisive people of the entertainment industry,\" the post read.\nThe irate Facebook post went on to call Hollywood liberals \"arrogant, pompous, pampered soulless individuals\" who are \"evil-hearted.\"\nIn what experts observe as a distinct pattern of several years of downhill interest for the Oscars, last year was an 8% decline from the 2015 show in overall viewers and a just over 4% 18-49 drop, according to Deadline.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:43:18.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
