They’ll first meet up on August 2nd in Louisville, Kentucky and hit up venerable venues like Red Rock Amphitheater in Colorado, New York’s Central Park SummerStage, and Maryland’s Merriweather Post Pavilion. \nFind both bands’ complete itineraries below. \nCold War Kids 2017 Tour Dates: 03/03 – Okeechobee, FL @ Okeechobee Festival 03/04 – Columbia, SC @ Music Farm * 03/05 – Charlotte, NC @ Fillmore * 03/06 – Saxapahaw, NC @ Haw River Ballroom * 03/07 – Atlanta, GA @ Tabernacle * 03/10 – Baton Rouge, LA @ Varsity Theatre * 03/11 – Fayetteville, AR @ George’s Majestic Lounge * 03/12 – Omaha, NE @ Sokol Auditorium * 03/14 – Madison, WI @ Majestic * 03/15 – Minneapolis, MN @ First Avenue 03/17 – Columbia, MO @ Blue Note 03/18 – Chicago, IL @ Riviera Theatre * 03/19 – Indianapolis, IN @ Egyptian * 03/21 – Detroit, MI @ St. Andrews Hall * 03/22 – Toronto, ON @ Danforth Music Hall * 03/23 – Pittsburgh, PA @ Stage AE * 03/24 – Covington, KY @ Madison Theater * 04/01-02 – Houston, TX @ Houston Whatever Fest 06/08-11 – Manchester, TN @ Bonnaroo Music Festival 08/02 – Louisville, KY @ Palace Theatre ^ 08/05 – Kansas City, MO @ Starlight Amphitheatre ^ 08/11 – Seattle, WA @ Wamu Theater @ Qwest Field ^ 08/12 – Vancouver, BC @ Sunset Festival 08/15 – Morrison, CO @ Red Rock Amphitheater ^ 08/17 – Albuquerque, NM @ Villa Hispana @ Sandia Casino ^ 08/18 – Las Vegas, NV @ The Pearl ^ 08/19 – Reno, NV @ Summit Pavilion at Grand Sierra ^ 08/20 – Eugene, OR @ Cuthbert Amphitheatre ^ 08/24 – San Diego, CA @ Open Air Theatre ^ 08/25 – Santa Barbara, CA @ Santa Barbara Bowl ^ 09/13 – New York, NY @ Central Park SummerStage ^ 09/14 – Boston, MA @ Blue Hills Bank Pavilion ^ 09/15 – Philadelphia, PA @ Festival Pier ^ 09/16 – Columbia, MD @ Merriweather Post Pavilion ^ 09/19 – Charlottesville, VA @ Sprint Pavilion ^ 09/26 – Birmingham, AL @ BJCC Concert Hall ^ 09/28 – Oklahoma City, OK @ The Criterion ^ 09/29 – Dallas, TX @ Irving Music Factory ^ \n* = w/ Middle Kids \nYoung the Giant 2017 Tour Dates: 02/23 – Albany, NY @ Palace Theatre 02/24 – Providence, RI @ Lupo’s 02/25 – New Haven, CT @ College Street Music Hall 02/26 – Richmond, VA @ The National 02/28 – Raleigh, NC @ The Ritz 03/01 – Columbia, SC @ Music Farm 03/03 – Okeechobee, FL @ Okeechobee Festival 03/05 – Columbia, SC @ Music Farm 03/07 – Asheville, NC @ Orange Peel 03/08 – Charlotte, NC @ The Fillmore 03/09 – Atlanta, GA @ The Tabernacle 03/10 – Atlanta, GA @ The Tabernacle 03/25 – Guadalajara, MX @ Anagrama Festival 04/07 – San Antonio, TX @ Maverick Music Festival 04/09 – Knoxville, TN @ Rhythm N’ Blooms 05/19 – Orange Beach, AL @ Hangout Music Festival 06/11 – Cleveland, OH @ LaureLive 08/02 – Louisville, KY @ Palace Theatre * 08/05 – Kansas City, MO @ Starlight Amphitheatre * 08/11 – Seattle, WA @ Wamu Theater @ Qwest Field * 08/12 – Vancouver, BC @ Sunset Festival 08/15 – Morrison, CO @ Red Rock Amphitheater * 08/17 – Albuquerque, NM @ Villa Hispana @ Sandia Casino * 08/18 – Las Vegas, NV @ The Pearl * 08/19 – Reno, NV @ Summit Pavilion at Grand Sierra * 08/20 – Eugene, OR @ Cuthbert Amphitheatre * 08/24 – San Diego, CA @ Open Air Theatre * 08/25 – Santa Barbara, CA @ Santa Barbara Bowl * 09/13 – New York, NY @ Central Park SummerStage * 09/14 – Boston, MA @ Blue Hills Bank Pavilion * 09/15 – Philadelphia, PA @ Festival Pier * 09/16 – Columbia, MD @ Merriweather Post Pavilion * 09/19 – Charlottesville, VA @ Sprint Pavilion * 09/26 – Birmingham, AL @ BJCC Concert Hall * 09/28 – Oklahoma City, OK @ The Criterion * 09/29 – Dallas, TX @ Irving Music Factory * \n* = w/ Cold War Kids \nWatch the video for Cold War Kids’ latest single, “Love is Mystical”, below.
