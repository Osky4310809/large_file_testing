Arts Opera star Marcelo Puente makes ROH debut after 13 years dreaming \nPuente, who told the Standard dreamt of playing the Covent Garden venue while working as a waiter nearby, stars as Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly Friday 24 March 2017 18:42 GMT Click to followES Going Out Debut: Marcelo Puente performing on the ROH stage Bill Cooper \nAn up-and-coming opera star says playing at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden is a long awaited dream come true. \nMarcelo Puente, 38, made his debut yesterday as one of opera’s great villains, Pinkerton, in the current production of Puccini’s Madame Butterfly. Puente, an Argentinian who quit medical school after hearing a recording of Pavarotti, told the Standard he had waited almost 14 years to perform on the Covent Garden stage, following a summer spent singing nearby in a local restaurant. \n“My sister Veronica was living in Cambridge with her husband and I was in my last year of my opera scholarship in Düsseldorf. I decided to come over to spend some time with her, then to make myself useful, I went to London, and I passed by the Covent Garden theatre. \n“I looked at it like a dream, and I saw an Italian restaurant nearby with a sign asking for staff. It was Sicilian, gone now. I got the job, the owner asked me what I was doing here, and I told him I was a singer. He asked if I’d sing in between waiting tables, so I did, all through the summer of 2003. Every day in that summer I’d pass the theatre on my way to work and I’d say to myself ‘one day, when I will be ready, I will sing here’. Now, 13 years have passed, and I’m here.” Heartbreak waiting to happen: Pinkerton ( Marcelo Puente ) with CioCio San, known as Madame Butterfly ( Ermonela Jaho ) (Bill Cooper) \nUnsurprisingly, Puente says his history with the iconic London venue means his performances there are particularly significant: “It’s very emotional, I almost cried at the first dress rehearsal because this for me is the horizon point, this is the biggest dream of my career. \n“When I was really young I saw all the Argentinian tenors who had sung here and now I’m continuing that tradition. I’m really, really, really happy.” Commanding presence: Carlo Bosi as Goro , Marcelo Puente as Pinkerton (Bill Cooper) \nPuente also revealed he discovered his talent by accident. “I was studying anatomy and to concentrate myself I put the CD of classical music on, and on that CD was Luciano Pavarotti singing. I began, just for fun, to impersonate him, and I realised that I had it naturally, so I began to investigate it… I was 19, 20. I had no idea about it. It was a surprise. \n“It was a surprise for everyone. My father told me I had to find a job and pay my own way for lessons. He encouraged me, but told me I had to fight for what I want and find my own way.” Five operas for beginners Five operas for beginners 1/5 La bohème \nPuccini’s popular masterpiece wasn’t always so popular: when it premiered in 1896, the reception was tepid, with critics deriding the music for being too simple. Fortunately, the world ignored such rot and the heartbreaking love story, a romance between poet Rodolfo and seamstress Mimì, has captivated audiences ever since. Michael Volpe, the director of Opera Holland Park says: “La bohème by Puccini is ideal. Sensational music, tragic love and not a dry eye in the house. I think the sneering at Puccini is diminishing; most people have come to accept that he was a genius and worthy of status alongside Verdi. People are also starting to realise that he wrote other great works, like Fanciulla and Rondine.” Volpe recommends Tosca as well. Another Puccini, it is acutely romantic, concerned with jealousy, love, passion, and sacrifice. It also has a cartoonishly evil villain in Scarpia, who has fabulously thundering theme. Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images 2/5 La traviata \nAnother Italian option, another love story. Set in hedonistic and glorious world of 19th century Paris, La traviata, Verdi’s most famous work, tells the story of Violetta, who falls in love with Alfredo, much to his father’s disapproval. This is opera, so of course, things don’t go well, but as Kasper Holten, Director of Opera at the Royal Opera House, says: “If you want to see a good, romantic love story, then evergreens La traviata might make you cry – in the good way.” Holten encourages audiences to be broadminded: “Opera is as versatile as life itself, so it is really difficult to say what would be your ideal first opera. What opera is sure to give you, is a deep emotional experience, an overwhelming experience of all the art forms combined into one, and the fantastic sensation when you hear a large orchestra, chorus and soloists at once.” Bertrand Langlois/AFP/Getty Images 3/5 The Magic Flute \nMozart’s Magic Flute is enchanting, and more than a little madcap, complete with sorcerer and a Queen of the Night. It follows the story of Prince Tamino as he tries to ‘rescue’ Pamina, daughter of the Queen, from Sarastro, the sorcerer. Sarastro is apparently evil, and then he’s not, and the whole thing bounces around, with light relief from bird-catcher Papageno. It’s all at once serious and comic, profound and yet contains the essence of silliness. It has the air of a fairy-tale, and the music is a little bit folky: there is none of the grand, stirring elegance of something like La bohemè, but that’s exactly the point: it’s something entirely different – opera covers a lot of ground. Boris Harvat/AFP/Getty Images 4/5 Peter Grimes \nFirst performed in Sadler’s Wells in 1945, Benjamin Britten’s opera is more modern than others on this list. The English National Opera’s artistic director Daniel Kramer recommends it as “a story full of suspense, chilling choral explosions and orchestral interludes that reflect the unique power of opera, all woven together by Britten’s astounding ability to capture raw humanity in melody – in English.” Apart from being in English and from the 20th century, Peter Grimes' plot differs quite dramatically from the love stories already mentioned. Grimes is a fisherman, who local townspeople suspect of being responsible for the death of his apprentice. Let off by a judge, he hires another apprentice, who also dies, and Grimes descends into madness. It’s certainly tragic, but its narrative isn’t defined by a romance – perfect for anyone who wants drama without the mush (although widowed schoolmistress Ellen Orford provides enough tenderness to tug at the heart strings). Bethany Clarke/Getty Images 5/5 The Barber of Seville \nRossini’s work is easy to listen to, and easy to be hooked by. The Barber of Seville is an excellent example – the overture is by turns calm, melodic, but it’s punctuated by great stabs of drama, and then lifts, sunny and running away with itself. Michael Volpe recommends it for those looking for something “light and effervescent”. It’s certainly a cheerful piece, fast moving and funny. Upbeat, joyful, if the audience are crying, it’s either with laughter or something has gone horribly wrong. Patrick Riviere/Getty Images \nMadame Butterfly, one of the most famous operas of all time, tells the story of an American Lieutenant of the US Navy, Pinkerton, who marries a Japanese girl for convenience, then promptly abandons her, eventually breaking her heart. Though Pinkerton may be seen as one of the cruellest, most heartless characters in the operatic canon, he is often performed somewhat sympathetically as a misguided, naive young man. Puente says he will emphasise this side of the character. \n“He is so eager to explore this new adventure. He’s getting used to it, he treats it like a game. The relationship is not serious for him, in the first act. In the third act, he regrets so badly, he’s full of remorse and everything, but in the beginning he is sympathetic because he is very young, and very ambitious, he doesn’t have a consciousness of what he’s doing.” \nMadame Butterfly is playing at the Royal Opera House from now until Tuesday April 25.
