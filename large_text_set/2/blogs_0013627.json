The 74-year-old actor’s publicist declined to release a statement.\nAmerican Airlines said they were aware of the incident and reported it to the FAA and NTSB “for further investigation”.\nIt wouldn’t be the first aviation-related incident involving Ford: in 2015, Ford crashed a World War II-vintage plane on a Venice golf course shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Airport.\nA general view at the Penmar Golf Course after a single-engine plane piloted by actor Harrison Ford crashed on March 5, 2015 in Venice.
