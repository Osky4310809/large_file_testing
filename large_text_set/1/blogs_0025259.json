The iconic hot hatch isn’t about to go full hybrid just yet, though, as it’s said to adopt a simpler and lighter mild hybrid powertrain for improved power, economy and emissions. \nApparently, the Golf GTI Mk8 will adopt an advanced 48V electrical system and an integrated starter motor (mild hybrid, provides acceleration boost), along with an electrically-operated turbocharger for the familiar 2.0 litre TSI engine. It should target the GTI Clubsport ’s 265 PS output, with even better low-end torque and response thanks to the fancy new turbo. \nThe Golf Mk8 range is expected to come to market by the end of 2019, with the GTI variant to follow in 2020. Word is that the next-generation Golf will utilise an updated version of the existing MQB modular platform, which, just like the original, should first debut on the new Audi A3 . Volkswagen insiders suggest that the structure will see a 50 kg weight reduction. \nGALLERY: Volkswagen Golf GTI facelift Research Volkswagen Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T08:03:05.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
