The centerpiece display at the Godwin Museum of Natural Bigotry \nNot only did Fiorito not apologize for depicting Trump as a Nazi on the billboard — owned by “arts” patron Beatrice Moore — she defended showing the president surrounded by mushroom clouds and dollar-sign swastikas.   \n“I think a lot of people are feeling this way and I’m just trying to express what I think is on a lot of people’s minds these days,” Fiorito said. \n“Some of these issues are so important you can’t not speak out,” billboard owner Moore said. She added that even though the billboard went up for an art festival, it will remain up as long as Trump is president. \nFiorito said that “a lot of people are feeling this way.” Fine. That doesn’t mean a lot of people are right. \nRepresenting Trump as a literal Nazi is to say that his followers are themselves literal Nazis. It is to say that they would countenance the genocide of six million Jews and countless others. It is to say that they hold irredentist views that we should invade other countries and subjugate their people. It is to say that they believe the government should exist to repress and slaughter all that dare oppose it.
