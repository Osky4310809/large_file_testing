The knock-on effects of sleep deprivation can lead to weight-gain , high blood pressure - and even heart disease. \nTo this end, sleep has become big business. There are pills, apps, teas, sprays and books which all promise to help send us off into a deep and replenishing slumber. \nBut if you've tried every lotion, potion, tablet and piece of tech out there and found nothing really works, then there are a few dietary tweaks which might help. \nIt's not always possible to control what you eat - especially when socialising in the evening. But if possible, both nutritionists and sleep experts have put their heads together and revealed in Health what to avoid eating before bed. 1. Bacon cheeseburger \nIt's probably no surprise how wolfing one of these down - however delicious - negatively impacts sleep. After all, it's never been exactly championed as a health food. \nThe fat contained in a bacon cheeseburger stimulates acid production in the stomach. You're potentially in for a long night if you have one of these for your dinner (Photo: Getty) \nThis, in turn, can spill in to the oesophagus, leading to heartburn, which is guaranteed to keep you awake. \nFoods high in fat such as a cheeseburger also loosen the barrier between the stomach and the oesophagus, which means that same acid can leak into places where it shouldn't be.

Alcohol \nForget the term 'nightcap', according to the site, having a couple of drinks to unwind before bed time is bad news for having a decent sleep. The term 'night-cap' can be misleading (Photo: Getty) \nThis is because alcohol metabolises rapidly in our systems - which is why you may find you wake up several times during the night after a few drinks. Not only this, but it also damages the 'quality' of sleep you're getting \nAlcohol also amplifies and strengthens any snoring. So if you share a bed, that's somehting to consider too. 3. Dark chocolate \nBad news for chocoholics or those with a sweet tooth . While dark chocolate is often touted as a healthier alternative to other chocolatey treats, it's not a perfect substitute. \nDark chocolate unfortunately contains caffeine, with Health pointing out how a Hersheyâ€™s special-dark bar has 20 milligrams of caffeine. Ditch the after dinner chocolate maybe (Photo: Getty) \nThis amounts to half an ounce of espresso. The stimulant theobromine found in chocolate also increases the heart rate and causes restlessness.

But the spices making up some of our favourite dishes may lead to a lack of sleep. \nAccording to Health, \"One study conducted in Australia found that young men who poured Tabasco sauce and mustard on their dinner had more trouble falling asleep and experienced less deep sleep than men who ate blander suppers. Spices can also cause heartburn\". A lot of enjoyable dishes, treat or drinks ave been cited as being bad for our sleep (Photo: Getty) 5. Meat (protein) \nThis even applies to chicken, sadly (although turkey contains tryptophan, a chemical which can aid nodding off). \nAny type of protein can place a burden on our digestive system, which should slow to 50 per cent while we're asleep. \nSo rather than focusing on sleeping, the body is now channelling its efforts into digestion.
