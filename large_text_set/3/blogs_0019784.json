Upon finding a locked door, Welch fired his AR-15 at the lock but was unable to open the door. Welch resorted to climbing furniture to see into the locked room and found it was unoccupied. \nAfter he was unable to find any evidence of child sex-trafficking, “ he exited the restaurant and surrendered himself to police officers that were already on-scene. ” \nOn December 16, Welch pleaded not guilty to federal charges of interstate transportation of a firearm to commit a crime, and District of Columbia charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and possession of a firearm during a commission of violence. \nThe combined charges carry a maximum of 35 years in prison. He is expected to plead guilty under a plea deal. \nUS District Judge Ketanji Jackson scheduled a plea hearing for March 24, when Welch could plead to fewer or lesser charges, and prosecutors could agree to a shorter sentence. However, Jackson is not obligated to accept any plea offers of agreed-upon sentences.
