Event is over capacity at 300+ Excited to thank the men and women of the intelligence community \n— Sean Spicer (@PressSec) January 21, 2017 \nAccording to The Washington Examiner, the speculation is that Trump is trying to apply a salve to the wounds created within the intelligence community over the now-infamous CIA report indicating that there was evidence that Russia had influenced the election to help Trump defeat his opponent, Hillary Clinton. \nThe Trump administration has insisted, also according to the Washington Examiner, that they took exception to the politicization of the intelligence agencies , rather than with the agents and employees within those agencies. \nTrump has been hinting about streamlining the 17 agency “Intelligence Community,” which would include the CIA, after mounting a general criticism of U.S. spy agencies via his Twitter account. Both Republican and Democrat leaders have expressed concern over his praise of Russian president Vladimir Putin, and his recent support of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who runs the organization responsible for a leak of Democratic National Committee emails that helped sully Clinton’s campaign. \n“One of the people familiar with Mr. Trump’s planning said advisers also are working on a plan to restructure the Central Intelligence Agency, cutting back on staffing at its Virginia headquarters and pushing more people out into field posts around the world,” The Wall Street Journal reported in early January.
