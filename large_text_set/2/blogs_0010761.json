Some Splatoon 2 news has revealed that the console will support wired LAN gaming so that up to ten docked consoles can connect and play without the need for an internet connection. \nSplatoon 2 also gave us a bit more of an insight into how the console's smartphone companion app will work, including how it will be necessary for voice chat when playing with friends online. \nFinally, it seems that the console's long awaited hardware specs have leaked on Reddit. The leak shows the console has a 32-bit quad core CPU capable of handling 2GHz and a Tegra X1 GPU. Overall, it makes the Nintendo Switch look like a solid console, sitting back from the cutting edge. Like any leaked information, though, these details should be taken with a generous pinch of salt. \nYou can read more below... \nWe got our first look at the potentially revolutionary Nintendo Switch console back in October of 2016 and although we finally got confirmation that the console would be a home/handheld hybrid, we didn't find out much more than that. \nThanks to the Nintendo Switch presentation that took place during Thursday night, we now know a lot more. Nintendo got the big news out of the way first, revealing that the console will be available on March 3 2017 and that it will retail for $299.99/ £279.99/ AU$ 469.95. Hands on: Nintendo Switch review \nDespite the fact that rumors had suggested otherwise, we now know that the console will launch with Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as well as 1-2 Switch, Just Dance 2017, and Skylanders Imaginators. \nThere will be other first and third party games further down the line including a brand new sandbox Mario adventure and Elder Scrolls: Skyrim with Nintendo stating that there are more than 50 companies currently working on over 80 games for the console. Cut to the chase What is it? Nintendo's newest console When is it out? March 3, 2017 (pre-orders open now) What will it cost? $299.99 in the US, £279.99 in the UK, $469.95 in Australia Nintendo Switch release date \nThe Switch presentation revealed that the console will launch worldwide on March 3, 2017. \nThe system will launch first in the US, Japan, parts of Europe including the UK, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and several other countries. \nPre-orders for the system have already started in the UK and the US, while in Nintendo's home country, Japan, fans have to wait until January 21 to pre-order the Switch. Nintendo Switch Price \nWe now know that Nintendo Switch will cost $299.99/ £279.99/ AU$ 469.95 – a bit higher than some wanted, and matching the launch price of the Wii U. However, it's well within reason for a new console when compared to other companies. In the US? Pre-order today from: Amazon ( Red/Blue )| Game ( Red/Blue ) | Zavvi \nFor this price you get the console itself, left and right Joy-Con controllers (in your choice of slate grey or neon blue and neon red), wrist-straps, the Joy-Con Grip, the Switch Dock, HDMI cable and AC adapter. \nThe Nintendo Switch Pro controller will be sold separately for $69.99 (we're still waiting to hear UK and AU pricing). \nYou'll also get the chance to buy Joy-Con controllers separately. These have been priced at $79.99 in the US and £74.99 in the UK for a set. Australian pricing has yet to be confirmed. \nIt's been confirmed that the Joy-Con grip that comes included with the console won't be able to charge the controllers. If you'd like a Joy-Con grip that charges, this can be purchased separately for £27.99 in the UK though the US pricing is unconfirmed. \nNintendo's previous generation of consoles, the DS and Wii, gained traction by launching at $150 and $250 (£99.99 and £179.99) respectively, but the Switch is more similar in price to its PS4 and Xbox One competition. Potentially this could harm its chances if it's not able to offer a comparable experience. Check out our full breakdown of the Nintendo Switch price Nintendo Switch features \nNintendo has always been a company willing to do its own thing. While Sony and Microsoft have fought over having the more powerful machines, Nintendo has focused its attention on interesting controllers and 3D displays. \nThe Switch looks like a very unique console indeed. \nIn recent years Nintendo has developed a bit of a problem with its attention being split across its consoles and its handhelds. The Nintendo Switch console will be a hybrid between the two, and might just solve this problem. \nFans have been waiting a long time for the console's hardware specifications and it seems they may have leaked online via Reddit. A recent post on the site containing leaked documents for the console suggests it has a 32-bit quad core CPU capable of handling 2GHz and a Tegra X1 GPU. The CPU news is positive, but the GPU is slightly underwhelming. \nOverall, it makes the Nintendo Switch look like a solid console, sitting back from the cutting edge. Like any leaked information, though, these details should be taken with a generous pinch of salt. \nThe Switch will have several modes of play including traditional home console TV Mode, Tabletop Mode where the console stands up on its kickstand and Handheld Mode, where multiple people can play simultaneously. \nWhen played as a handheld, you attach two controller portions to the side of a 6.2\" 720p multi-touch screen, which feature a 'split' d-pad. \nThese can then be detached when your dock the console, at which point you can either play the console with a more traditional 'Pro controller', which features a classic Nintendo d-pad, or reassemble the detached controller handles into a gamepad using the 'Joy-Con grip'. \nNintendo says the Switch has a touchscreen, Wi-Fi, and can connect up to eight other Switch systems for a big local multiplayer experience. \nFans of foreign games will also be glad to hear that the console isn't region locked. That means you'll be able to access all the JRPGs you've ever wanted. \nAs far as battery life is concerned, you can expect your Switch's 4310 mAh battery to last between 2.5 and 6.5 hours in handheld mode. How long it last is entirely dependent on which game you're playing – games that force the processor to work harder will of course sap the battery quicker. \nFor example, Nintendo has confirmed that if you're playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild you should expect to get closer to 3 hours out of a single charge. \nOverall this is a similar battery life to the Nintendo 3DS so we're not all that surprised. Fortunately, unlike the 3DS, the Switch doesn't have a dedicated charger and instead uses a modern USB-C connector so it should be easier to charge on the go. \nThe battery isn't, however, removable so if you're looking for a replacement you'll have to go through Nintendo. \nThe dock for at home play will allegedly contain an additional fan , which will help to cool the console, allowing it to run at a faster clock speed while docked and not running on battery power. \nThis faster clock speed means that the processing power of the console will increase, allowing it to output at 1080p resolutions on external televisions. \nWhen in the dock the Switch will charge via its USB-C connector. \nThough you'll get a dock included when you buy the console, you'll also be able to buy more separately so that you can have them connected to every TV in the house for the ultimate level of on-the-go play. Unfortunately, the dock will cost a fairly expensive $90 but no pricing has been confirmed for the UK or Australia. \nNintendo CEO Tatsumi Kimishima has confirmed that the console will see a wide array of accessories , which some have taken to mean that we'll see multiple detachable controller types. \nNintendo has confirmed that you won't be able to use the tablet to create a dual-screen gaming experience similar to the Gamepad with the Wii U. Instead, the Switch will be an completely single-screen experience \"on whatever screen you might choose.\" \nThe trailer also confirmed the fact that the console will feature games sold on a cartridge rather than a disc. \nUnfortunately this means that the console won't be physically backwards compatible . \nUnfortunately the console will not support streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video at launch . Nor will it have a browser for you to access these services in another way. Nintendo has justified the move by saying that its focus is on making a gaming system first and foremost. \nNeither the presentation nor the trailer made mention of a major rumor that was doing the rounds about the console supporting VR after the company admitted it was \"researching\" VR technology, according to someone who was present. \nTwitter's attended the meeting in Kyoto and claims Nintendo's Shigeru Minamoto said Nintendo was researching VR but has concerns about users playing for long periods of time. Nintendo Switch Controller \nThe primary controllers are named Joy-Con, and they look like they could be the most capable pads Nintendo has ever introduced. These are the controllers which are attached to both sides of the touch-screen while the console is in tablet mode. \nThe Joy-Con Controller can be detached, forming two one-handed controllers. Each section can read amiibo figures and can be used as a fully functional gamepad, but each side has its specialty. \nThe right side has an IR blaster built into the bottom of the controller and scan objects. During the presentation Nintendo said the controller could recognize hand gestures, for example, and would know the difference between rock, paper and scissors. \nIts joystick thumbpad will also have an amiibo reader built in. \nThe left side will have rumble HD, an advanced version of haptic feedback. Finally, the Joy-Con will come in two colors: neon red and neon blue. \nIf you want these different colors, the Nintendo Switch will be sold in two different versions, one with two gray Joy-Con Controllers and the other with neon red and blue controllers. \nIn addition to the Joy-Con controllers there is a Pro Controller, which appears to be a more traditional gamepad, featuring the classic Nintendo d-pad. This controller will be sold separately for $69.99 in the US and £64.99 in the UK with Australian prices yet to be confirmed. Online Service \nHere's a bit of bad news. The Nintendo Switch is going to be the first Nintendo system that's going to charge you money to play online. \nThe online service will start off free for Nintendo Account holders during the system's first six months after launch but, come the fall, it's going to cost you. \nSo far the online service has only been announced for North America (USA, Canada and Mexico), with no word yet on if, or when, it will be making its way to other territories. \nThe online service will include such features as online lobbies and voice chat, free NES and SNES games every month (although they'll only be playable for that month), and 'may' include exclusive deals and discounts. \nYou will not need to subscribe to the paid service to access the eShop, manage online friends or share screenshots. \nThough details remain unclear, it appears that the Switch's online service will be heavily dependent on its smartphone companion app. \nNot only will players have to use the app to access voice chat features, according to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Amie and a recent Splatoon 2 announcement, they'll also be able to use it to organize playing with others online and find people they know by connecting it to their existing social media accounts. \nSome good news is that the Switch will support wired LAN connection. A recent news announcement for Splatoon 2 revealed that players will be able to connect up to 10 docked consoles (8 players and 2 spectator screens) for local multiplayer without the need for an internet connection. True LAN play hasn't been seen in a Nintendo console since the GameCube so this is an exciting and convenient feature for the console. \nThat said, the console doesn't have a standard Ethernet port, so you'll need to use an Ethernet to USB adapter to take advantage of the feature. \nWe've contacted Nintendo to ask for more clarity on what exactly the companion app will enable and what form of online play will be possible without it and we'll update with any reply. Nintendo Switch Games \nWe have a few different avenues to learn about the games that are coming to the Switch. The latest is from the Nintendo Switch presentation, which detailed Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Super Mario Odyssey and Splatoon 2, three totally unrevealed games. \nOutside of the three first-party titles, you can also expect Project Octopath Traveler, Dragon Quest X and XI, Fire Emblem Warriors and FIFA (yes, it's just called FIFA) as well as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on the Switch. \nWe also got the news that a remastered version of Mario Kart 8 (named Mario Kart 8 Deluxe) would be coming to the Switch in April with additional tracks and characters. You'll also be able to hold two items at a time, a feature that has completely divided the office. \nThe star of the show, however, will be the new The Legend of Zelda game, Breath of the Wild, which launches on the same day as the Switch, March 3 2017. \nSince the live stream we've also had confirmation of a number of other Switch games including World of Goo, Little Inferno and Human Resource Machine which will be available as part of the launch lineup. \nThe announcement brings the total number of Switch games available at launch to 10: 1-2-Switch, The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+, Just Dance 2017, Human Resource Machine, I Am Setsuna, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Little Inferno, Skylanders: Imaginators, Super Bomberman R and World of Goo. \nThe games are beginning to appear on retailer sites as available for preorder where the prices appear to be ranging between £50 and £60 in the UK through retailer Game and set at $60 in the US through Amazon . \n(Want the quick and dirty? Here's 6 things you need to know about the Nintendo Switch) \nBeyond official announcements, there are a couple of other rumored games that have us excited. \nA recent listing of the Switch console on the GameStop retail site has hinted that we could see a Pokemon title come to the console, adding to previous rumors that a directors' cut of Sun and Moon called 'Stars' was planned for Switch release. \nSpotted by a NeoGAF user, the description of the console on the GameStop website read “Nintendo Switch games will include new title offerings from Mario, Splatoon, Zelda, the NBA and more! You will even be able to play Skyrim on the go, or Pokémon at home with the Nintendo Switch.” \nInterestingly a couple of these games, including Mario Kart, appear to be ports of Wii U games. In the weeks that followed the launch, further reports backed up the suggestion that Wii U ports would feature heavily in the console's catalogue. Switch leaker Laura Kate Dale reported that fan favorite Super Smash Bros. would allegedly be making the jump to the new console within six months of the console's launch, along with the game's remaining associated Amiibo.
