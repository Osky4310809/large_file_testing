Plus, Biddle had 9-month-old twins that she needed help caring for. So, in November, she moved in with her parents in Murrysville. \nBut what she didn’t want to do was add any more trauma for her 6-year-old daughter, Kamdyn. \nSo she asked the girl’s principal if Kamdyn could finish the school year at Steward Elementary with her friends and postpone a change in school districts until the summer. \n“I had gone into the school and told them what was going on and they were fine with it. The principal said that’s fine, you own your house in Monroeville that shouldn’t be a problem,” said Biddle. \nAnd there wasn’t a problem, until Thursday. \n“I went in for a parent-teacher conference, and as I was walking out, they presented me with a letter,” said Biddle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:47:19.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
