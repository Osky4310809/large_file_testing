The license transfer is expected to be completed by the end of February. \nThe ownership change isn’t going to influence the cafe’s concept. She said the new owners — the Saleh family, first-time restaurateurs — are keeping the staff, menu, and decor exactly as it is now. \nWhile de Francisco’s name won’t be on the cafe’s documents, it will ll still be on the menu: Andrea’s Portuguese breakfast board comes with a baguette, ham, cheese and butter. \n“I was looking for the right owners that would keep it the same, that was really important,” she said. \nWhen Cafe St. Jorge opened in 2013, de Francisco said it was her way of expressing passion for her own Portuguese heritage. The place is named after the place in the Azores from where her family stems. It became a staple over the years at its spot at the base of Bernal Heights, along Mission Street. \nCafe St. Jorge: 3438 Mission Street, at Kingston. cafestjorge.com Search Keyword search across all the entries in this blog.
