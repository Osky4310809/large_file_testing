The joint solution integrates the Agile Controller, Huawei’s SDN controller, with Ubuntu OpenStack to improve the efficiency of deploying and maintaining multiple data center networks. A large number of controller nodes can be deployed in minutes to interoperate with the cloud platform quickly. Enterprises or telecom cloud platforms that are using or plan to use Ubuntu OpenStack platform can directly connect their OpenStack platform with the Agile Controller to enable quick, flexible service deployment and integration in multiple data centers. \nCanonical’s OpenStack Interoperability Lab in Boston builds more than 3000 OpenStack clouds every month to test and verify the interoperability of different hardware, SDN and software combinations, helping customers to integrate and deploy their cloud platforms and SDN solutions in a secure environment. This new joint initiative between Huawei and Canonical includes the integration of Huawei Agile Controller with Juju , Canonical’s service modelling tool, that provides the ability to quickly deploy complex workloads including OpenStack with various SDN controllers. The combination of Huawei Agile Controller and Ubuntu OpenStack with Juju tooling enables the rapid efficient scaling and operation of complex application services while minimizing the need for manual intervention. \n“We are honored to expand our strategic relationship with Huawei. Ubuntu OpenStack and Juju integration with the Huawei Agile Controller enhances customer data center management capability, especially when it comes to operating large-scale data center deployments easily. Our collaboration with Huawei delivers even simpler and more efficient automated data center solutions to our customers,” said John Zannos, Vice President of Cloud Alliances and Ecosystem at Canonical. \nHuang He, General Manager of the Huawei SDN Controller Domain, said: “Openness is a key factor of a data center network solution. Huawei Agile Controller has passed interoperability certification with multiple providers of commercial OpenStack versions. The successful integration with Canonical reflects the deepened cooperation with cloud platform providers. This joint solution achieved not only automated network device configuration and service orchestration, but also the quick installation and deployment of the controller system itself. This further improves the data center operation efficiency.” \nBy cooperating with Canonical, Huawei makes another step toward an all-cloud network management ecosystem. Huawei is continuing the effort promoting commercial SDN deployments and creating an open, cooperative, win-win SDN ecosystem. The alliance of Huawei and Canonical benefits enterprise and telecom users by improving the network management efficiency and is a significant to the development of the entire ecosystem. \nFor further information please contact Posted in:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:26:21.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
