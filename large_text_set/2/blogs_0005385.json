People trying to tear us apart, people trying to make us turn against each other. \n“My proudest moment... if you take a look around in this room, you’ll see people from all races and all places - and all we did tonight was come inside this building, show love, celebrate life, more life, and more music.

And she didn't. \nThe superstar's dig at Trump was simple and subtle but crushingly effective.
