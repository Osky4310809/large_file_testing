He also suggested gas companies should release more supply to the domestic market without a reservation policy. Malcolm Turnbull to tap gas chiefs for solutions in emergency energy talks Read more \nWhen asked about imposing a reservation policy, Turnbull said the federal government had “considerable power” to control exports, but said his aim was to “ensure we have action from the gas companies”. \n“The gas companies – I have no doubt – are very well aware they operate with the benefit of a social licence from the Australian people. \n“And they cannot expect to maintain that if while billions of dollars of gas are being exported, Australians are left short.” \nEarlier on Radio National, Frydenberg said Turnbull would tell gas companies the government wanted them to produce more gas for the domestic market, including by developing their untapped reserves faster. \nFrydenberg said prices had increased due to increased export of liquid natural gas, less investment in exploration due to low oil prices, and gas moratoria in several states. \nBut the increases had not been sufficient to incentivise development of reserves, which Frydenberg said amounted to 180 years’ supply in the Northern Territory and 40 in Victoria. \nAsked about potential shortages next summer, Frydenberg noted the companies had existing supplies that they could release into the domestic market in the meantime.

This is to act before an emergency occurs. \n“We had this absurd situation on the 8th of February when everybody knew a heatwave was coming that the Australian Energy Market Operator chose to black out South Australians rather than turn on Pelican Point gas-fired power station.” \nWeatherill said that was “unacceptable” and the national electricity market was “broken”. \nWeatherill said the new powers would overcome “market power concentrated in the hands of a few companies” that were used “to screw” South Australian consumers by limiting power supplies to increase prices. \nWeatherill blamed the Abbott and Turnbull governments for national energy shortages, saying the abolition of a carbon price had resulted in an “investment strike” that had pushed up the price of energy by under-investment in generation.
