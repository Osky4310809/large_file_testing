He spent the 2016 season as Oregon’s defensive coordinator. \nHoke, though, is returning to his roots as he broke into the business in college football as a D-line guy. He helped the Wolverines win a national title as their D-line coach in 1997. \nTennessee’s defense ranked 107th in the nation and just 111th against the run a year ago. After starting 6-0, the Vols lost three straight games to fall out of the College Football Playoff picture, then suffered a rare loss to Vanderbilt in the regular-season finale before beating Nebraska in the Music City Bowl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:40:41.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
