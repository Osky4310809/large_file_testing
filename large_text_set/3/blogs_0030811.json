The disappointment of finishing third when first seemed so possible just a few games earlier masked the fact that Spurs had managed their highest finish in 26 years, not to mention the small matter of clinching a Champions League place – surely the best anyone at the club was hoping for at the start of the season.\nA strong defence, an exciting young team built on a budget, a clear strategy that held its own against the other big sides – Pochettino had clearly transformed Tottenham. How’s he getting on in his third season in north London?\nStart of season expectations Pochettino has already been linked with Europe’s elite clubs (Picture: Getty) Well, they handed Pochettino a new contract in May, so they must have been pretty pleased with him, though without necessarily expecting miracles every year.\nMore of the same will have been the Argentine’s simple task, though increased competition in the Premier League with Chelsea, Manchester United, City and Liverpool all likely to improve meant that Poch would surely be safe without a top four spot this time round.\nDespite being relative newbies to the competition, Spurs will also have been expected to get through their Champions League group and progress as far as possible from there, depending on the luck of the draw.\nMore: Football Shameful stat sums up how feeble Arsenal have been this season \nAlexis Sanchez: I used to play football in JAIL \nReal Madrid ace hints he has HUGE problem with Arsenal star on social media \nCups don’t carry the same importance as league position these days, but with no trophy since 2008, winning one of the domestic competitions may have been on the agenda and shouldn’t be out of the club’s reach with the squad they have.\nAchievements so far Being ten points behind Chelsea might not sound like a huge achievement, but it’s closer than anyone else at this moment in time, and Spurs look the best-equipped to pounce if there is to be an unlikely slip-up from Antonio Conte’s men. Also important in this half of north London is their nine-point lead over Arsenal, which currently looks like giving them a genuine chance of finishing above their neighbours for the first time since 1995.\nPochettino has been hailed by Alex Ferguson as the best manager in England (Picture: Getty) Tottenham are also in a position to spoil Chelsea’s season in the FA Cup as they meet them at Wembley in the semi-finals. Get past them, and a final against Arsenal or Manchester City awaits, in what would undoubtedly be a terrific chance to lift the famous old trophy for the first time since 1991.\nMORE: Pep Guardiola report card: Man City project not going to plan \nOther notable successes include the joint-best defence in the league alongside leaders Chelsea (just 21 conceded so far), convincing home wins over both the Blues and City, and just the three defeats in the league all season long, which came to Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool. Oh, and somehow continuing to get Harry Kane and Dele Alli to look like absolute world-beaters.\nHe also, quite possibly, destroyed Pep Guardiola, whose City side have just not looked the same since that 2-0 loss at White Hart Lane in October, which was their first of the season.\nPochettino's full Spurs record \n\nWon 79 Drawn 38 Lost 35 Share\n\nLow points Well, the Champions League campaign certainly didn’t go to plan: just two wins and six goals scored in six group games – back to the Europa League for you, Spurs.\nAnd that didn’t go very well either, with a dismal display over two legs leading to a 3-2 aggregate defeat to Belgian outfit Gent. Playing at Wembley hasn’t helped their cause in Europe, but it isn’t enough of an excuse to lead to such a significant drop in performance level for a side so solid and consistent in the league.\nThings didn’t go well in Europe for Pochettino (Picture: Getty) Pochettino has understandably been linked with a number of top jobs around the continent – Barcelona, PSG, Manchester United – but his bizarrely poor record in European competition could come back to haunt him when elite sides weigh up whether or not to move for him.\nSpurs' summer signings Victor Wanyama – £11million\nVincent Janssen – £17million\nGeorges-Kevin N’Koudou – £9.4million\nMoussa Sissoko – £30million There’s not a great deal else to criticise, except perhaps some questionable work in the transfer market. The excellent Victor Wanyama aside, Tottenham’s summer signings have all been tremendous flops: Vincent Janssen has proven to be the next Roberto Soldado, incapable of scoring unless it’s from the penalty spot, while £30million Moussa Sissoko has done nothing. Both are already being linked with exits. Oh, and remember Georges-Kevin N’Koudou? No? Exactly.\nTactical reputation Pochettino’s tactics have got the best out of these two (Picture: Getty) Already pretty high after last season’s surprise title challenge, and his stock has risen again this year, particularly after the recent feat of copying the 3-4-3 system that has worked so well for Conte at Chelsea and arguably doing it even better.\nRose on Pochettino ‘He said was if I entered into his philosophy, he would make me into an England player, so he’s been true to his word. He’s been like a father figure to myself and a lot of the players here. I owe the manager and his staff a lot of praise.’ Since changing to three at the back for the away game at Watford on New Year’s Day, Spurs’ record in all competitions stands at: Played 16, Won 11, Drawn 3, Lost 2. On paper, it doesn’t look too surprising with the quality of Kyle Walker and Danny Rose as wing-backs, but just look at how many teams have made a success of such a system in recent years and you’ll struggle.\nPochettino’s first real success with the system came with the 2-0 win over Chelsea on 4 January, and in many ways you could argue his win over Conte was more impressive than those achieved by Jurgen Klopp and Arsene Wenger earlier in the season, as it came when the Italian’s side were at the absolute peak of their form. Conte’s own change to 3-4-3 inspired Chelsea’s 13-game winning streak, but it was Pochettino’s Spurs who ended it and prevented them making history.\nTottenham’s strongest team in Pochettino’s new 3-4-3 formation (Picture: Metro.co.uk) First manager to beat Guardiola’s City, first to beat Conte’s Chelsea once they’d sorted themselves out – the guy is undoubtedly a tactical magician of the highest order.\nObjectives for the rest of the season Stay in second if possible. Winning the title is surely not on the cards given how Chelsea are playing, but give the leaders something to worry about by staying as close to them as possible from now until May. Even if it only means finishing above Arsenal, fans will be very happy with that.\nMourinho: These are the types of players I want to bring to Manchester United And more realistically, bring home an actual trophy by winning the FA Cup. Spurs have shown they can beat Chelsea and will be confident against them again in their semi-final next month.\nAnd if possible – and this is out of their hands for the moment, to be fair – set up the first ever North London Derby in an FA Cup final and win it. Forget league titles, forget the Champions League – Pochettino would be a guaranteed legend on this side of north London forever if he pulled that off.\nCan Pochettino assert his dominance over Arsenal?

Tottenham surely know their biggest worry regarding their manager is having him poached by a bigger club rather than whether or not they could find anyone better. He’s very much the real deal – the best they’ve had for a long time. He has arguably already done something none of his predecessors has managed for decades – he’s built a Spurs team that’s actually better than Arsenal.\nMORE: Arsene Wenger report card: Arsenal at an all-time low under the Frenchman \nMORE: Antonio Conte report card: Dream start has Chelsea on course for the double ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T14:16:29.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
