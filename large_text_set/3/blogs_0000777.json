Mar 1, 2017 10:26 AM \nWise. \nAlthough Brady is still at the top of his game, sometimes Father Time pushes you off a cliff without any notice. See Payton Manning. JG has been with the Pats a couple of years now and likely is quite ready when needed. mannyiac says: Mar 1, 2017 10:28 AM \nBelichick is just driving the price up for Garoppolo.He won’t be in a Pats uniform next year. Mar 1, 2017 10:29 AM \nWanna bet? Mar 1, 2017 10:31 AM \nPats fan already has this guy as a pro bowler. seabrawk12 says: Mar 1, 2017 10:31 AM \nReality of having a 40 year old QB is setting in. They would be wise to hold onto him. Mar 1, 2017 10:32 AM \nLots or discuss…. \n1. One has to wonder if this is just a way to drive up the price. 2. There was talk in the last week or so about a new deal for Brady, is this a reaction to how those negotiations are doing? 3. Would they rather trade Jacoby? lgw91s says: Mar 1, 2017 10:33 AM \nNot really surprised. Its simply too tough to find a franchise QB. You can find lightening in a bottle like Seattle or Dallas, but, teams can go a long, long, time looking. Patriots want to contend for the SB every year, and regardless of how long TB12 wants to play, father time remains undefeated. If Tom suffers another serious injury, or if he is not satisfied with his level of play, he’ll walk away. \nJimmy G will be a very good QB – for the Patriots aarons444 says: Mar 1, 2017 10:33 AM \n“According to Pats homers, they were gonna get a 1st rounder for this future hall of famer!” === \nThose yahoos believe Belichick will pull off Herschel Walker 2.0! thelastwordyaheard says: Mar 1, 2017 10:34 AM \nIt’ll be painful to watch this kid become a stud for another team, but Brady will probably play for 5 more yrs, so it’s all but inevitable.. chippys lost binky says: Mar 1, 2017 10:35 AM \nShifty and Werder have shown on several occasions that they are not exactly dialed in to the thinking in Foxborough. If a team calls to make an offer on Garoppolo Belichick isn’t going to hang up the phone. And now to settle back for the parade of the uninformed that will tell us all about what a former 2nd round pick that has shown he can run an NFL offense at a high level isn’t worth. factschecker says: Mar 1, 2017 10:36 AM \nI hear what they are saying loud and clear. \nThe Pats love him (For good reason) The Pats do not need or want to trade him. \nDon’t waste time with weak offers. They are not trying to “unload” him just to get ride of him. \nFirst Class Dynasty Problems. rhamrhoddy says: Mar 1, 2017 10:39 AM \nIf the Pats are stuck with Jimmy G for another year, I could deal with that. \nMaybe Brady actually starts to fade late next year, maybe not but if that happens, then maybe the focus changes on re-signing Jimmy. Mar 1, 2017 10:43 AM \nsuperpatriotsfan says: Mar 1, 2017 10:23 AM According to Pats homers, they were gonna get a 1st rounder for this future hall of famer! \n———— \nFirst off, fans are supposed to be homers. There is no expectation of fans being impartial like media are supposed to be. Of course fans wanted to trade Jimmy G for a first round pick and get a future HOF player. \nThe problem is fans have no idea how good Jimmy G is other than watching 1.5 games. \nSo it is all speculative. If Jimmy isn’t going to be the next great QB then trade him now while there is value and risk Brady not declining this year. \nIf you don’t trade him now then I think they means either the trade value is just too low or they intend to sign him to a starter contract before 2018. \nDon’t forget they also have a lot of time invested in developing him. \nI just don’t know what would happen in 2018. Not sure he would sign with the Patriots for 2018 and then sit behind Brady for 1 or 2 more years. Could be interesting if they keep Jimmy. belichickdominatedjoemontana says: Mar 1, 2017 10:44 AM \nGranted free agency was around back than, but Steve Young didn’t start all 16 games for the 49ers until he was 31 years old. If Jimmy signs a 4 year extension…it makes sense to keep him. He will be a “young 30”, with little wear and tear. I could see Jimmy playing into his early 40s because of this. Thus making sense to keep him. pastabelly says: Mar 1, 2017 10:45 AM \nThe only thing that makes sense out of this is that Brady might just retire after next season. Otherwise, it makes no sense having Garoppolo sit on the bench and watching him become a free agent and signing somewhere else this time next year. weepingjebus says: Mar 1, 2017 10:47 AM \nGood. We want him to stay and we don’t need more picks. We will just let your teams continue to underdevelop players and then pick them up for a song. Oh, and Peyton fell off a cliff because Papa John’s greasizza + HGH < Avocado ice cream and revenge. htown1035 says: Mar 1, 2017 10:48 AM \nDon’t forget, it’s lying season right now… Mar 1, 2017 10:50 AM \nI can only quote the words of LA sportswriter Ramona Shelburne: \n“Nobody thought it was possible. Nobody thought they could do it. \nBut then the Patriots found a way and drafted a quarterback who is better looking than Tom Brady. \nBelichick is a genius.” lgw91s says: Mar 1, 2017 10:51 AM \nThere could be (and probably is) a lot of back room discussions going on with Belichick, Kraft, Brady, Garoppolo, and Don Yee.(who represents them both) \nPatriots always have a long term plan. patriotsdefense says: Mar 1, 2017 10:53 AM \nDriving up the price. steelerfanjo says: Mar 1, 2017 10:53 AM \nWith a convicted cheater at QB, a convicted owner and coach in charge, why would they trade him? Brady is scum off and on the field and one hit away from being out with a bruised pinky. Jimmy G can play. dpdonny says: Mar 1, 2017 10:55 AM \nI don’t think Jimmy G’s stock will ever be as high as it is right now. It’s a perfect storm for the Pats. \nWhat all these reports fail to mention is Jimmy will be in the last year of his rookie deal, which he is unlikely to play under. Then what? Sign him? He wouldn’t unless you pay him more than Brady, which is folly. \nSo that leaves the question: If the Pats don’t trade him what do they do to keep him around? Pay him and trade Brady? I don’t see that happening, but then again it’d be the most Belichickian thing Belichick would’ve ever done. 6ball says: Mar 1, 2017 10:56 AM \n. It clears out the bottom feeders, those who’ve been offering a conditional 7th in 2019 . Mar 1, 2017 10:57 AM \nThis guy is worth a 3rd round pick at best hockeykrishna says: Mar 1, 2017 10:58 AM \nI have been a Patriots season ticket holder since 1982 and I hate to see this news. He is not the next coming of Tom Brady get the draft pick now. the window with Brady won’t be open for another 10 years we will be lucky if it is 3. Brissett has the tools I would also like to see them tag Hightower this is too good a team to let it fall apart like it did in 2015. beachsidejames says: Mar 1, 2017 10:59 AM \nIf he’s as good as Pats fans say he is it would be smart to keep him. With Tom looking at 40 why would you trade him unless he sucked. That what’s good about Belechick… He keeps you guessing. dwarftosser says: Mar 1, 2017 10:59 AM \nThis means their price is way too high for any good GM to pay. This guy has one year until he is a free agent, thinking a team is going to give up a first round pick for a guy they get for one year is ludicrous. He is worth more to New England keeping him around as an insurance policy rather than giving him up for a 4th round pick or so. redripper says: Mar 1, 2017 11:00 AM \nWonder how many championships the pats would have if they had traded brady when Drew Bledsoe starter . lacardinalsfan says: Mar 1, 2017 11:01 AM \nSigning Jimmy and trading Tommy??? Those Patriots sure are tricky. No one saw it coming. scrappler says: Mar 1, 2017 11:02 AM \nduh. the patriots have to take this position and leak this stance no matter what they really plan to do to maximize their chance of extracting maximum value from some sucker franchise. \nof course that’s their position — wow me with an offer, we aren’t planning to trade him somehomer says: Mar 1, 2017 11:02 AM \nAdam Sch”ILL” efter is yet again leading the Patriot disinformation campaign. tedmurph says: Mar 1, 2017 11:03 AM \nI’ve never heard one Patriot fan EVER say JG was a Pro Bowler or a HOFer. I too think the Pats are whispering in people’s ears to drive up the price. His value won’t be as high next offseason. They can’t keep both after next season, because of the money the Pats would have to invest in a position where only one of them plays. I also think people that think Garoppolo would take less money to stay and hold a clipboard rather than go somewhere, make more money and start are nuts. Even if it’s Cleveland. \nAnd, I GUARANTEE if they do trade him, They get MORE than a 1rst rnd pk. stevebowl says: Mar 1, 2017 11:04 AM \nCan’t go wrong either way. They’d be kicking themselves if they got rid of him and Brady gets hurt next season. But if an offer comes with multiple picks including a first rounder that Goodell stole from the Patriots, that’s fine too. kevpft says: Mar 1, 2017 11:04 AM \nIt sure seems like the Pats would like for JG to be Brady’s successor. Maybe it’s worth it to them to hold on to him just in case it works out that way. \nThink about it. What’s the price for him – a 1st-round pick? How much is that really worth to a team like the Patriots? They don’t live or die on 1st-round picks. \nI could easily see a team like the Pats, who make the most of every round of the draft, thinking he’s more valuable to hold on to, even if they lose him outright a year from now, than to just give him away for a speculative draft pick. wordzhurt says: Mar 1, 2017 11:05 AM \nSo, they’re basically just waiting to announce the trade with Cleveland until a little bit before the draft? \nThe Patriots like insurance and all, but there’s a limit to what you pay for a policy, and the potential opportunity cost here is just too high to leave him on the roster UNLESS \na) you really aren’t getting what you want in the trade market \nAND \nb) you already have him extended \nIf the news of a contract extension with Brady is true, this makes even less sense and is either a negotiating tactic for JG trades (likely) or a negotiating tactic for Brady (less likely). harrisonhits2 says: Mar 1, 2017 11:05 AM \n“So that leaves the question: If the Pats don’t trade him what do they do to keep him around? Pay him and trade Brady?” \nThey can always tag him and trade him next year. \nIf, and its always a big if because is extremely tough to repeat as Super Bowl champs, if the Pats win the SB next season Brady could retire at that point. His wife has apparently been pushing him to retire for the last 3 years. \nIf he gets to an 8th Super Bowl and wins it? I suppose he could go for another but at some point even Brady will be satisfied with what he’s achieved. aarons444 says: Mar 1, 2017 11:09 AM \nWhat all these reports fail to mention is Jimmy will be in the last year of his rookie deal, which he is unlikely to play under. Then what? === \nThey can handle it the same way they did with Matt Cassell; Tag and trade. \nOr, if he really is their future, then they keep him. Mar 1, 2017 11:13 AM \nI’m so very happy to read story, i even clicked my heels with joy! 🙂 Michael Miceli says: Mar 1, 2017 11:15 AM \nThey may franchise Garropolo for two years 2018 and 2019 and give Brady the boot after that. If you are looking for LONG TERM SECURITY at the most important position in the league, you do not let Garropolo go anywhere. Belichick may already have seen some decreases in Brady’s ability that the average fan does not see. Brady may play to 45 but it may not be with the Patriots. If I have my choice of being a stud team for the next ten years, or get emotional about Brady playing his entire career here, I will choose the former. ibillwt says: Mar 1, 2017 11:15 AM \nJust won a fifth ring, 2nd in 3 years, loaded with more qb talent than any other team, pockets bulging with loads of extra cap space cash, four draft picks in the first 104, rock stable coaching and front office staff, entire team re-energized and bought in for another run after being part of the greatest win in SB history. \nDoes it get any better for Pats fans? Probably not, but man were loving it while we got it, and a 6th ring would put even more candles, in the icing, on that big fat cake, sitting on our gold platter. Enjoy! Mar 1, 2017 11:16 AM \nsuperpatriotsfan says: Mar 1, 2017 10:23 AM According to Pats homers, they were gonna get a 1st rounder for this future hall of famer! \n——- \nIt works in both directions. The fans would want to trade him because his value is high due his talent and the market demand. \nIf he’s a HOF QB, fans would expect a ridiculous deal for him if/when he’s traded. \nIf he’s a HOF QB, you want him to stay on your team to take over (and not play for another team unless you get the value). \nThere’s literally no bad situation if Jimmy G is as good as some people think he is. losangelesbillsofbuffalo says: Mar 1, 2017 11:18 AM \nThis is smart on the Patriots for a couple reasons: \n1) Brady has long taken lesser Salaries to benefit the Pats’ Cap Space, potentially giving the Patriots reason to pay more for a temporary Backup than all other teams in the League. \n2) Withholding Jimmy to the public only increases his value around the League, meaning some team is likely to “overpay” if they want him badly enough. \nNews Flash, BB does the smart thing every time. jchipwood says: Mar 1, 2017 11:24 AM \nHard to gauge how good or bad a player actually is when your coach is cheating on an annual basis. How many times have the patriots been caught cheating in the last decade? Just a sidenote, other teams have caught them, not the NFL. Makes you wonder how much more the NFL has swept under the rug. lifetimefan says: Mar 1, 2017 11:24 AM \nGeez…if the Pats are doing this for the sole purpose of driving up the price, I wonder if Mr. Harbawl will claim it is deceptive and try to get the rules committee to legislate out this behavior? AngryHumanoid says: Mar 1, 2017 11:25 AM \nThis is smart in a lot of ways. Either see if someone bites with a deal that is too good to pass up, or you hang onto him as a the backup to Brady or his potential replacement should Brady’s performance drop off. \nGarropolo was clearly intended as the heir apparent, his skill level and potential was miles better than backups they had before him, but Brady has outlasted expectations of his viability. \nYou HAVE to go with, and keep going with Brady until performance drops to the point he is done, he will not leave until he physically cannot compete anymore. If that happens in the next year you have a prime candidate to replace him, but if he’s still going strong next year then you have a harder decision to make. jm91rs says: Mar 1, 2017 11:26 AM \nThis has to increase the value of AJ Mccarron, right? And if the local reports are right, he will actually be a restricted free agent next year because of his inactive time with a shoulder injury. Any team signing him would have him for at least 2 years without even having to negotiate with him as a true free agent. Mar 1, 2017 11:28 AM \njchipwood says: Mar 1, 2017 11:24 AM Hard to gauge how good or bad a player actually is when your coach is cheating on an annual basis.

Makes you wonder how much more the NFL has swept under the rug. \nJust another sidenote woodchip…If the Pats are guilty of anything that you so loosely describe, then you may want to look at what your favorite team has been accused of or caught doing. That hypocrite outfit gets tight sometimes don’t it? rob471773 says: Mar 1, 2017 11:29 AM \nThe people saying Jimmy is too good and the Pats are wise to keep him need to realize one thing. \nThe Patriots would be keeping him for 1 year only. After this season, why would he even consider resigning with the Patriots? So he can back up Tom Brady for another 2-3 years??? \nJust doesn’t make sense. \nThe Patriots are holding onto him and the only benefit is, they have great QB insurance for 1 year and 1 year only. Apparently to them, they value that more than the draft picks they’d get back in a trade. Mar 1, 2017 11:29 AM \nBelichick playing the rest of league like a fiddle. \nSome team, let me rephrase that, some stupid team will realize the Patriots aren’t going to give him away just for the sake of moving him. \nThey will move him. A 1 and a 3 and he is gone. Mar 1, 2017 11:31 AM \nBB isn’t always right, but he is right more often than not…. thedangerouskitchen says: Mar 1, 2017 11:36 AM \nsuperpatriotsfan says: Mar 1, 2017 10:23 AM According to Pats homers, they were gonna get a 1st rounder for this future hall of famer! \n– \nThe Pays homers have a point there yoo. If they do trade him then absolutely a first rounder is part of that deal. The Patriots already spent a second rounder and invested the work to develop. No way are they going to take less than they spent. This talk that the Pats are going to take less than they spent is just homers of other teams that want a steal deal trying to sell themselves on it. They wont sell Belichick though.
