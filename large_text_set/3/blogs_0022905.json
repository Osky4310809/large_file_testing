The meeting has been labeled as not for coverage, and restricted even to close-in government media. \nAfter the meeting, Thai ministers and Philippine Cabinet officials will join the two leaders in an expanded bilateral meeting. \nThe two leaders will then give a joint press statement. \nWith the official meetings wrapped up, Duterte will get a chance to enjoy Thai culture. A viewing of Thai handicrafts with the Prime Minister has been scheduled, to be followed by an official dinner hosted in the Philippine president's honor. \nDuterte's 2nd full day will be devoted to meeting the private sector. \nHe will meet with representatives of Thai agri-industrial and food conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Public Company Limited and then participate in a roundtable discussion with Thai business groups hosted by Invest Philippines. \nHis last event in Bangkok is a meeting with the Filipino community of Thailand. Around 1,900 Filipinos have registered for the event, according to the Philippine embassy. \nFrom there, he will head to the airport for his flight to Manila. He is expected to arrive past 1 am on Thursday, March 23. \nPriority topics for discussion \nThe Thai government said security issues will be a priority topic during the official meetings of Duterte, Prayut, and their Cabinet. \nAccording to the Bangkok Post , the Thai government expects leaders of the two countries to discuss the fight against illegal drugs, the conflict in Mindanao, and cooperation between government intelligence agencies. \nThe Philippines and Thailand are also expected to ink 3 deals : a 5-year tourism development plan, an agreement on science and technology, and an agreement on dairy production. \nConcerns of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will also be on the agenda, given the Philippines' chairmanship of the regional bloc this year. \nDelegation \nDuterte's official delegation includes 9 Cabinet members and two senators.
