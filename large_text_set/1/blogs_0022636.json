Chicago Public Schools students had planned a walkout earlier in the day and several appeared in school uniforms at the event. College students also took part.\nLeena Almasri is a second-year student at DePaul University. She says she’s speaking out against hateful comments made during the campaign.\nArmy veteran Darius Shannon of Chicago is another protester. He says he’s focused on 2018 when there’ll be midterm elections. He hopes for a Democratic wave.\nSeveral protesters are holding signs that read “Resist Trump” while others say “Solidarity Trumps Hate.”\nTrump became the nation’s 45th president on Friday.\n(© 2017 The Associated Press.
