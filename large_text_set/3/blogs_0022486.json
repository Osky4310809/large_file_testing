The jurors found Dickinson liable for a $25,000 award against the Schneiders only. \nSenior planner Robert Sherry, who has since retired, was hit with $750,000 in punitive damages against the two families while jurors awarded the Schneiders $1 million from county aggregate resource manager Jeff Gamel. \nGregory P. O'Dea, the privately retained attorney who represented the county, said he will appeal the awards and hopes to have them overturned by Judge Kimberly J. Mueller on post-trial motions. \nIn the trial that lasted more than a month, the plaintiffs charged that the county shut down the mine as a result of political pressure applied by Teichert Construction, their much bigger rival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:44:00.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
