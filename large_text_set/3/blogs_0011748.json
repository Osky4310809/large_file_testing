There's a difference between bullying him and joking around. I was joking around.\" \nJustin, 23, addressed the reporter directly in the caption that sits alongside the video. \nThe chart-topping star wrote: \"SORRY BEN - If you don't get the context its from an Australian TV show called 'Summer Heights High'.

(Photo: Splash News) \nHowever, Justin subsequently went on to send more abuse in the direction of the reporter and the \"news lady\" who reported the incident. \nAgain adopting the persona of Jonah, he said: \"Sorry Ben! Motherf***r! (sic)\" \nJustin later added: \"I was doing it for fun. You just didn't get that it was fun. You on your period or what, miss?\" It sounded like he shouted \"f**k you\" (Photo: Splash News) Justin was hanging out with pals on Makepeace Island (Photo: Splash News) He was relaxing in Australia (Photo: Splash News) \nJustin has rarely been out of the headlines during his tour of Australia, where it was recently reported he hand-picked a dozen models to party with during a late-night cruise. \nAll of the women were asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement and surrender their phones before boarding his boat. \nRoze Cook and Nyssa Large, who Justin follows on Instagram, were among the 12 glamorous girls hand-picked for the three-hour trip, but Justin returned to his hotel alone after his boat docked after midnight early on Sunday morning.
