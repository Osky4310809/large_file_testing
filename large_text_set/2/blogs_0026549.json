Beckham finished with seven receptions for 108 yards on nine targets that day. \nOn Sunday, Sherman showed off his respect for Beckham when he posted a picture on Instagram of all the jerseys he's collected from players over the course of his career. Players like Dez Bryant , Tom Brady , Antonio Brown , Calvin Johnson and Charles Woodson were all on display. Looking through the closet .... quite the collection... A post shared by Richard Sherman (@rsherman25) on Feb 25, 2017 at 11:46am PST \nThe message Beckham wrote to Sherman, if anything at all, could, unfortunately, be blocked in the image above. The two players have only matched up against each other once in their careers, so it makes it even more meaningful that Sherman decided to include Beckham in his collection. \nOn the field, Beckham still has the upper hand, at least for now.
