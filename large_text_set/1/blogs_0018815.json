This year, for the first time, Xiaomi declined to provide annual sales figures , raising doubts about whether it can continue the impressive growth that gave it a $45 billion valuation two years ago . \nBrazil-born Barra said in a Facebook post announcing his departure that his primary motivation is home sickness. \nWhat I’ve realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health. My friends, what I consider to be my home, and my life are back in Silicon Valley, which is also much closer to my family. Seeing how much I’ve left behind these past few years, it is clear to me that the time has come to return. \nHe added that the company’s global footprint, which was his primary responsibility, is “in a very good place.” \nAt the time of his arrival, Xiaomi business was limited to Greater China. Under his leadership, Xiaomi has expanded across Asia and beyond to reach more than 20 countries, although the U.S. is not on that list. Xiaomi has seen its crown as China’s top smartphone maker slip under competition from Huawei and up-and-coming phone makers Oppo and Vivo, so expanding globally became a more important priority in that light. It isn’t yet clear how Xiaomi has done in that respect. \nIndia has been its brightest spot — Barra himself has spent plenty of time in the country — and Xiaomi said that it reached $1 billion in annual revenue in India for the first time in 2016. In a company-wide letter, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun spoke of his desire to continue to expand Xiaomi’s overseas reach, but it hasn’t provided any additional figures about how it has got on so far. Now, the company is faced with the challenge of replacing Barra — who is well-liked and respected across the industry thanks to his time with Google-Android — with a figure who can take its global push to the next level. \nXiaomi co-founder Bin Lin, also a former Google executive, said senior vice president Xiang Wang would lead Xiaomi’s international business going forward. He also payed tribute to Barra’s tenure with the company. \nWhen Hugo joined us 3.5 years ago, we started an amazing adventure to turn Xiaomi into a global player. We have come a long way since, and I couldn’t thank him enough for contributing so much to Xiaomi’s journey. As much as we would love to have Hugo stay with us in Beijing for a much longer time, we understand his personal challenges and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. \nBarra said he plans to take some time off to rest before “embarking on a new adventure back in Silicon Valley.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T08:38:08.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
