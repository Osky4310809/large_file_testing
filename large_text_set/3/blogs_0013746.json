Saitama has taken the world by storm with his legendary fists, and a multitude of memes. With season two on the horizon American fans get a huge surprise today, as it looks like One-Punch Man has been added to the US Netflix . \nThe popular superhero parody series is no available on Netflix in both the original Japanese with English Subs, as well as in the newly English Dubbed version as well. This is good news for those looking to catch up before the upcoming second season, or just fans that want to re-watch the glory all over again. \nFor those unfamiliar with the One Punch Man series, here is a summary of the plot from Viz Media: \n\"Nothing about Saitama passes the eyeball test when it comes to superheroes, from his lifeless expression to his bald head to his unimpressive physique. However, this average-looking guy has a not-so-average problem—he just can’t seem to find an opponent strong enough to take on!\" \nThe series first started as an ongoing web-comic by the author that goes by One, in early 2009. The comic went viral and so a full remake and publication of the series began in 2012 on Shueisha's Young Jump Web Comics website. Viz Media brought the manga to America in 2016 in the Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine. One Punch's anime series was created by Madhouse and first aired in Japan in late 2015, and was dubbed for English in the summer of 2016. The anime and manga both have had huge international success and recognition since release, winning New York Times Manga's Best Sellers List, was nominated for an Eisner Award, and the anime was also featured on the popular Toonami block. \nOne Punch Man coming to Netflix is huge news for anime fans in the US because English dubs for shows are usually held by Viz Media for a long time. This might mean a bright future of more rights for popular anime shows coming to Netflix in the future. \nThe second season for anime has been announced and set for a 2017 release, although there is no official release date as of yet. \nMore One Punch Man News:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:30:53.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
