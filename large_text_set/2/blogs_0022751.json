They mostly eat insects and mice, though there are some sections of Australian folklore that tell legend of Megalania prisca , an ancient specimen that might have measured up to 23 feet in length. Megalania was known to feast on small mammals and birds, and may have been able to spit venom, which is super fun. Look, we’re not saying that the giant monitor found storming through a New South Wales restaurant this week was Megalania , but we’re not ruling it out, you know? Whatever the case, the waitress that wrestled the 6-foot lizard into submission is a worldwide hero. \nThe video is pretty astonishing. It shows a bunch of tranquil Australian diners enjoying a meal on an outdoor patio, but then this monitor comes storming through with one of the restaurant’s wait staff in hot pursuit. The waitress, 25-year-old Samia Lila from France, seizes the lizard by the tail and begins dragging it back outside, with the massive meat-eating reptile thrashing and twisting all the way. Women stand on chairs. The monitor claws at the floor. It’s a Planet Earth II -worthy battle of wills.
