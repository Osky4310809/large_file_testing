Guardiola had been keen on a Kimmich reunion (Photo: Getty) Ancelotti will make Kimmich his first-choice right-back next term (Photo: REUTERS) \nAsked about a potential move away, Ancelotti stated: \"There is no way Joshua [Kimmich] will leave in the summer. way!” \nThe Italian also hinted that Bayern will be taking up their option on Kingsley Coman, the on-loan French international who is another Guardiola target. Coman will also be staying put (Photo: REUTERS) \nBayern paid €8million to take the Juventus starlet on loan in 2015, but after an outstanding debut season he has struggled with injuries this term. \nA recent double in the rout of Hamburg showcased his talent however, and when asked about his future, Ancelotti stated, matter-of-factly: “Kingsley Coman will stay too”.
