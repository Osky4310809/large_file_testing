(CBC) Related Stories Time changes can leave dairy cows udderly unimpressed, farmer says \nA private member's bill in Alberta wants to put an end to fiddling with the clocks, but the grassroots activists who fought to bring an extra hour of sunshine to the province nearly 50 years ago wants it to stay. \nBill Creighton was one of the two Calgarians who spearheaded the campaign to bring daylight time to the province. \nIn 1967, Alberta was one of the few places in North America that didn't participate in the bi-annual time change. \nBut Creighton and David Matthews saw the benefits that hundreds of hours of extra sunlight could bring to amateur sports and outdoor activities in the province between March and November. \n\"It's not like we're in California where every night it's nice and warm to sit out,\" Creighton said. \n\"If you've got kids or grandkids, like I do, playing these sports, you go to support them and you just about freeze to death most nights.\" 4-year fight for extra sunlight \nThe pair launched a grassroots movement, which saw them face-off on public radio and television against drive-in theatre owners who worried the change would hurt their bottom line. \nNewspaper spreads advocated against the proposed change. \nOne ad read, \"If you think you're in the dark now, consider what Daylight Saving Time will do.\" \nAnother warned the switch would mean \"sending young children to school in the cold and damp 'twilight zone' of early morning\" and would hurt their grades. An example of one ad that ran in the Calgary Herald, urging Albertans to vote against the plebiscite to bring daylight time to the province. (Paul Fairie/Twitter) \nThe '67 plebiscite was defeated, but by such a slim margin of 51 to 49 per cent that Creighton and Matthews kept pushing through to the next election in '71. \nThey triumphed that year, 61 to 39 per cent. Year-round daylight time \nNow, nearly 50 years later, Alberta's youngest MLA says people \"overwhelmingly\" want to stop fussing with the clocks. \nBy the end of the month, Thomas Dang plans to introduce his private member's bill to abolish the time change, but that could include staying on daylight time permanently â€” meaning Alberta would not fall back this November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:24:52.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
