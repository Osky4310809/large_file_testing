(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters) \nToday's Women's March offers President Trump an early opportunity to assuage concern that he'll rule like a strongman. \nHe could praise the protesters for availing themselves of one of the democracy's greatest gifts, the opportunity to dissent. He could promise that the demonstrators' concerns will be considered as he moves through his agenda. He could offer up something as simple as, “I hear you.” \nIf the past is any indication, Trump will do none of these things. \nInstead, he'll likely try to discredit the protesters as stooges of some kind of enemy. That's what he did during the campaign, when he accused Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and George Soros of sending violent disrupters to his events . Sometimes, Trump and his surrogates even suggested that the activists were being paid to make a ruckus. There was, and is, no evidence to of this. Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2016 Breaking: Anti-Trump Protest Funded and Directed by Hillary https://t.co/7rx7P4NHsa \n— Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) March 12, 2016 . @realDonaldTrump rallies being infiltrated by agents provocateurs from the Left. Bogus demonstrators to spark violence. #notYUGE \n— Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) March 12, 2016 \nThis line of reasoning draws directly from the handbook of strongmen and dictators the world over. (\"Discredit or dismiss the protesters” is an actual step in “ The Dictator's Handbook ,” a jokey dissection of how autocrats govern.) \nTo take just a few examples: In Ukraine in 2004, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Kiev to protest the fraudulent election of President Viktor Yanukovich. (Nelson Ledsky of the National Democratic Institute said observers “reported that the rigged voting was in the neighborhood of over 1 million extra votes.\"). Russian President Vladimir Putin, who backed Yanukovich, accused the United States of financing the activists, saying that America has a history of pursing a “dictatorial” foreign policy, packaged in “beautiful, pseudo-democratic phraseology.” In Turkey in 2014, Prime Minister Erdogan blamed “ foreign-backed” mercenaries for inciting the Gezi Park protests. When protesters took to the streets in 2011 Moscow to demonstrate against a rigged election, Putin accused the United States of orchestrating. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton “set the tone for some opposition activists, gave them a signal, they heard this signal and started active work,” Putin said at the time . In Hungary, Viktor Orban has suggested that dissenters are actually “subversives from abroad.” Syria's Bashar al-Assad has blamed antigovernment protests on “armed terrorist groups” “spreading chaos and instability.\" (Ironically, he would later release actual terrorists from jail, hoping that they'd join, and thereby discredit, the opposition.) \nThis is more than an effort to save face. It's a deliberate strategy, one intended to discredit the very idea of protest, to make the act of civil disobedience seem unpatriotic. As Foreign Policy explains , “according to dictators, dissent is always the work of a foreign agency whose ultimate goal is to impose Western values and destabilize the country. These foreign agents bribe impressionable and otherwise loyal citizens to execute their dirty work, turning them into puppets susceptible to manipulation and seduced by the promise of money.” \nIt's clever. Under this rubric, opponents of a regime are necessarily unpatriotic — stooges of rich anarchists or leaders from other countries. This makes it seem like any attempt to question a leader is suspect. Or, as Srdja Popovich, author of “Blueprint for Revolution” writes : \nSuch tactics condition people to distrust democratic action — or any kind of activism at all — creating an apathetic and cynical society in which corrupt authoritarians thrive. By blaming any and all dissent on foreigners, the regime convinces people that they have no right to question its actions. Furthermore, inventing a foreign adversary distracts people from domestic issues, further securing the regime’s stability. After all, the threat of a foreign invasion is much more frightening than high unemployment or corruption. Of course, when leaders start to believe their own spin, they can lose sight of their country. That's what happened to Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevich, who worked assiduously to discredit the young people who rallied against him as “well-paid” stooges of the CIA. After his fall, secret police memos proved that Milosevich really believed this to be true. Popovich writes: \nThis conformation bias could be the most dangerous part of the conspiracy narrative. Imagine the consequences when this process takes place on a far larger scale. Imagine President Putin, trapped in his own conspiracy narrative, really believing that enemies all around him are trying to grab Russian land through a “fifth column” and engineering revolutions in the “near abroad” — all to attack him personally. This logic would lead the Kremlin into the mind-set of a new Cold War, moving its military to its Western borders and sparking conflicts in Europe and beyond. world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:20:52.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
