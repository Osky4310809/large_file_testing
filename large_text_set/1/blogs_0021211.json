The bass-thumper’s third LP will be a 23-track behemoth that will feature cameos from Kendrick Lamar , Wiz Khalifa and Pharrell , as well as help from award-winning tenor saxophonist Kamasi Washington and Brainfeeder Records boss Flying Lotus . \nThe first single is a one-of-a-kind collaboration with Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald called “Show You The Way.” The ballad came about after Thundercat expressed his love for “This Is It” singer Loggins during the press tour for his previous album, 2015’s The Beyond/Where the Giants Roam , according to a press release. \nIn a recent interview with the Red Bull Academy , Thundercat explained, “These are guys that I’ve listened to and where I felt that I’ve learned that honesty in the music… Kenny Loggins is one of my favorite songwriters. One of my favorite songs is ‘Heart to Heart’ because you can hear the life that he’s lived in that in that song. That song was so much of the inspiration behind this album. That song, literally, I would sing it all loud. I’m like, ‘Kenny knows what’s going on. He gets it. He’s been there. He’s been to the wall.’ I used that as a guiding light for the album.” \nDrunk will be available on CD and digitally on Feb. 24, including in a four 10″ vinyl collection due out March 10.
