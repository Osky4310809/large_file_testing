The actor, 30, was handcuffed in mysterious circumstances as the stream was still being broadcasted.\nThe exact details are unclear, but it is being reported that LaBeouf allegedly assaulted a man with political beliefs different to his own. The official Twitter feed for the #HeWillNotDivideUs movement, the name of LaBeouf’s art installation protest, has since posted a 13 second video that shows the actor shoving a man who initially appears to be nothing more than a friendly fan, before he says “Hitler did nothing wrong.”\nShia LaBeouf has been arrested by NYPD, because of this video #HeWillNotDivideUs #FreeShia pic.twitter.com/Sj8RqP7uGm \n— #HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDUS) January 26, 2017 \n\n“Hey,” says the man. “Why did he attack me?” Later tweets from the same Twitter account suggest that there was perhaps more to it than just that altercation: “Shia was attacked by a Nazi. Shia got arrested. Nazi got away.” In a later video, protesters are seen saying: “Shia took a hit for us. There were all these Nazis here, he came out and tried to protect us.”\n\nLaw enforcement officials from the NYPD have been posted at the site since Sunday, shortly after LaBeouf shouted down another protester by yelling “He will not divide us” into his face.\nWhite supremacist yells into the camera and Shia LaBeouf shuts him down. This has been a very interesting live stream. #HeWillNotDivideUs pic.twitter.com/CqY9pLobWi \n— #HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDUS) January 23, 2017 \n\nStay tuned for more information.\nIn other news, a Shia LeBeouf lookalike has been punched for resembling Shia .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T13:29:37.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
