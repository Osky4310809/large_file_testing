Ben Affleck is totally aware that his younger brother, Casey Affleck , didn't give him a shout-out during his Golden Globes acceptance speech. The Live by Night director and actor, 44, joked about being left out during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday, January 9. \n\"Someone was omitted … I was a little taken aback,\" the Oscar winner teased. \"That’s not the kind of thing I would do. If it’s me, you know, I thank people.\" Casey Affleck and Ben Affleck attend Amazon Studios Golden Globes celebration at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 8, 2017. Todd Williamson/Getty Images \nKimmel added to the fake sibling feud by recalling how Ben mentioned Casey when he won the 1998 Oscar for Good Will Hunting with BFF Matt Damon . PHOTOS: Celebrity Siblings \n\"I needed that little push, but I did say 'My brother is brilliant.' Those words came out of my mouth,\" Ben said. \"We didn't hear anything like that last night [at the Globes]. I mean [there was] the thing with Denzel [ Washington ], and the thing with Matt [Damon], he was Mr. Hollywood.\" \nAs previously reported, Casey, 41, won best actor for his work in Manchester by the Sea . While on stage, he thanked Damon, 46, for producing the film, his estranged wife, Summer Phoenix , and their two sons, and quoted a past speech from Washington, where he said \"God is love.\" \nNevertheless, Ben was excited to go home and ask his three kids — Violet, 11, Seraphina, 7, and Samuel, 4 — if they watched \"Uncle Casey\" on TV. \"[Sam] said, 'The man said Casey Affleck!' Ben explained to Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday. \"So he appreciated it.\" PHOTOS: Stars You Didn’t Know Were Related \n\"I had to explain to my son that presenting is also very honorable,\" he added, laughing. \"That's very esteemed. That's like winning.\" \nBen, Casey and Damon have remained very close since growing up in Boston. The Argo star told DeGeneres that the actors and their families all went on a skiing vacation recently. \"We are at the point where all of our children are better skiers than I am,\" he said. \n\"And who's the most behaved kid out of all of them?\" DeGeneres, 58, asked. \"Is it one of yours?\" \nThe Justice League actor quipped: \"No.\" PHOTOS: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner: The Way They Were \nBen and his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner , have co-parented since separating after 10 years of marriage in summer 2015. \"I have the world's greatest mom, but even she could not conquer the obstacles there,\" he said. \"They are all great kids.\" You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T18:31:12.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
