But honestly, who says your wedding day is the only time you can dress up in a fancy white gown?\nThe ladies who graced the Oscars red carpet tonight seem to agree with us, as a slew of them showed up in heavenly, cream-colored ensembles that quite clearly say “White is in, and not just for when you’re getting married .”\nTo start: Here’s our fave code-loving model and Taylor Swift’s BFF Karlie Kloss , in a sleek sheath number and super intense, sparkly choker. George Pimentel/Getty Images Star Wars: A Rogue One Story ‘s Felicity Jones dazzles in a tulle dream that pants-loving Jyn Erso probably wouldn’t be a fan of, but we are head over heels for. George Pimentel/Getty Images We could see Olivia Culpo’s gown on a bride whose wedding is waterfall themed — with the ceremony taking place under an actual waterfall, while the stars twinkle above. George Pimentel/Getty Images Here’s our favorite sharp-tongued Twitter user Chrissy Teigen , whose only accessory sexier than her actual gown was the thigh-high slit. And also the cape, because she’s basically Superwoman anyway. And her smile, because really, everything about her is actual perfection. Lester Cohen/Getty Images Auli’i Cravalho, aka, the voice of our newest favorite Disney Princess , went for a strapless number whose gold pattern actually seems like it was inspired by seashells. Moana would be proud. ANGELA WEISS/Getty Images You think that’s all? Not even close.\n\nThe high neckline, floral appliques, the translucent fabric, the defined waist…we don’t know where to look on Hailee Steinfeld’s dress, so we’ll just keep staring until we’ve had our fill (so, tomorrow). Steve Granitz/Getty Images It’s hard to look away from The Mummy star Sofia Boutella ‘s super-toned arms, flawless skin, and shiny hair, but the sparkly bodice and feathered bottom of her mermaid-style gown are tempting us. Jeff Kravitz/Getty Images Sting might be up for an award tonight, but his wife — actress Trudie Styler — won the red carpet in a gorgeous, long-sleeved off-the-shoulder gown that looks as comfortable as it does glamorous (can we get a version to sleep in or is that weird?). Steve Granitz/Getty Images You all look fabulous, ladies, and we’re glad you’re giving us a reason to rock white that doesn’t involve marrying someone!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:31:16.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
