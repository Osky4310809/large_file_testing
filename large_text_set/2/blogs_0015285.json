Don’t call my f***ing man a pedophile!”\nSecurity was forced to interfere when the mom of Leah , 7, pointed her finger in Abraham’s face and even seemed to throw a punch .\nPHOTOS: Furious Hillary Clinton Catches Husband Bill Eyeballing Donald Trump’s Daughter Ivanka \nWhen Abraham’s father Michael stepped in to defend his daughter, Baier ran over, and the two men came to blows. Michael fell to the floor, and a security guard was forced to put the volatile father of nine into a chokehold.\nAfter guards cleared the area, Portwood started screaming again.\n“Don’t you ever f***ing speak of me again!” she shouted, before taunting, “Do somethin’!”\n“The criminals will do s***,” Abraham, 25, responded.\nPHOTOS: J.Lo Heats Up Her Romance With Drake In New Raunchy Snaps \n“That’s right, I’m a f***ing felon!” said Portwood, who served more than a year behind bars on drug charges before her November 2013 release. “But I say s*** to your f***ing face!”\nEventually, the drama dissipated, but not before Portwood hurled some final insults at her nemesis: “P***y a** b****! Shut the f*** up! Shut your f***ing crooked lips up!”\nMonths later, Portwood is still standing by her man. Though Baier hid nine secret children from her in their early relationship, the couple may be getting married in Las Vegas this weekend .\nThe women, along with costars Catelynn Lowell and Maci Bookout , will return to Teen Mom OG for the series’ 7th season on April 17.\nWe pay for juicy info!
