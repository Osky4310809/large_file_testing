A recent article featured in WWD revealed that Zosia Mamet hated her wardrobe in HBO’s Girls . This means the bright colors and mix-matched patterns often worn by the hyperactive and robustly virginal Shoshanna never represented even a small portion of Mamet’s style index.\nAt Spring Studios in Manhattan, during an event celebrating American Express’ Platinum Collective Mamet shared her thoughts on Shoshanna’s style .\nShe told WWD :\n“Literally in six seasons there wasn’t one time that I wanted anything or would have worn anything in real life that Shoshanna wore on the show. Her style is like if trendy took acid.” Is that a bad thing, though?\n\nvia GIPHY \nApparently, Mamet opts for more minimalism and less bright patchy outfits when piecing together her everyday look. She added:\n“I would say [my style] is like if Diane Keaton had a baby with the Seventies,” she explained. “My wardrobe doesn’t shift that much. I have a plain pair of black Doc Martens that I’ve been wearing pretty nonstop.” Does Mamet’s everyday decision match Shoshanna’s technicolor fictional life in Tokyo? Only time will tell.\n\nvia GIPHY \nWe’re sorry to squash your internal dialogue that melted Shoshanna and Mamet into one cohesive persona. But those are the knocks.\n\nvia GIPHY \nNow we can chalk up her convincing commitment to Shoshanna’s fashion to her abilities, rather than a deep-seeded desire for polka dot dresses.
