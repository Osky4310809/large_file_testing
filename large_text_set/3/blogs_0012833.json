The FA Cup is the only trophy left for boss Guardiola to win. \nTV pundit Roy Keane believes they need to sign up to SIX world-class players this summer to be able to compete among Europe’s elite, and claimed their Champions League last-16 exit may be a blessing in disguise. \n“I think where Pep wants to bring Man City — competing in the Champions League and Premier League — he simply doesn’t have the players to do it,” said Keane.

You can’t compare where City are with Barcelona and Bayern Munich when he got to those clubs, and I think this will confirm Pep’s thoughts from over the last few months. \n“You need a big setback in a big game to confirm it and to say to the owners; we need to get four, five, six top quality players into the club. Otherwise when they are at this stage of the competition again next year, they are going to have exactly the same problems.\" \nCity took a 5-3 first-leg lead to France, but were outclassed in the first half on Wednesday night. Leroy Sane's second-half goal still had them set to go through on aggregate with 15 minutes to go, but they couldn't hold on and went out on away goals as the tie ended 6-6. \nKeane added: “They looked like they were going to get out of jail, they were back in the game, in the driving seat, had the momentum and then they give a daft free-kick away. Guardiola needs to rip up the current squad, according to pundit Keane (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n“They didn’t have enough defensive-minded players when you see the goals they have given away. Then they don’t defend the set-piece properly. You deserve what you get.” \nCity are ready to embark on a £200million spending spree to strengthen Guardiola’s hand and give him a squad capable of fighting with the very best. \nSeveral high-profile players, including skipper Vincent Kompany, out-of-contract fellow defenders Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna and Gael Clichy, as well as keeper Willy Caballero and midfielder Yaya Toure, are all set to leave . \nClichy admitted there are likely to be big changes this summer as Guardiola gets ruthless with a squad that lacks sufficient quality to compete on a level footing with Europe’s elite clubs. \n“Of course, people will talk and say things,” said the full-back. “What’s going to happen in three months is up to the chairman, the boss and the club.

We can win something still this year [the Blues face Arsenal in an FA Cup semi-final next month] so we have to believe and finish strongly.” \nClichy admitted the players failed to carry out Guardiola’s instructions against Monaco and must take full responsibility for their exit. \n“It wasn’t the way the manager wants us to play,” he said. “We didn’t really create any chances. \n“We dropped, we didn’t press and he doesn’t like that — so his message at half-time was 'If you have to go out of this competition at least go out playing the way you want to play.' \n“We started the second half a different way. We pressed high and had so many chances. If we’d started the game like we did the second half, it could have been different.

Since he took over, his philosophy is to go forward, to press the team we’re playing, to win the ball high up the field and then pass the ball to a player who can be creative and make something happen, but we just didn’t do it. \n“It’s a big disappointment, but more for how we played in the first half. When we play like the manager wants, we can create problems for any team, but we have to look forward to Liverpool on Sunday now, because the season isn’t finished. \n“We want to be as close as possible to Chelsea as we can in the league,and we still have the FA Cup. \n“There are still some games to go, so the message is to finish strong. We have to do it for ourselves, the manager and the fans.” poll loading As Man City manager, Pep Guardiola will win... 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:57:21.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
