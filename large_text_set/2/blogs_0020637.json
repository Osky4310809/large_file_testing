In its latest design patents, Samsung is now considering expandable, slide-out displays as an additional phenomenon for its upcoming devices. Slide-out expandable displays would allow users to slide the display in when using the device for basic phone and internet functions, but slide the expandable display out when watching movies and TV shows or gaming. \nOf course, foldable smartphones return in one of the two design patents, showing the foldable smartphone that we’ve come to expect of the phenomenon. The smartphone display (a single, flexible display) has a center hinge on the side that will be use to fold the smartphone in half, with it appearing to be something of a book-like shape. \nSlide-out, expandable displays are definitely a new area for Samsung, but the Korean giant has spent far more time in creating foldable smartphone designs and plans to showcase a prototype device at MWC 2017. The company has patented foldable tablets as well, particularly one with a built-in keyboard and stand . \nCheck out more of Samsung’s design at the link below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:03:55.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
