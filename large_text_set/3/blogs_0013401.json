I wasn’t sure if I was going to share it, but I am sharing it … it’s important.”\nThank you to @TheTalkCBS for letting me speak my truths. No one better to do it with than you wonderful ladies. I love you❤\n— Carnie Wilson (@CarnieWilson) March 14, 2017 \nRELATED VIDEO: Carnie Wilson: Weight a Constant Battle for Me \nWilson said she would not have chosen to get breast implants if faced with the same choice now.\n“Today I wouldn’t have put them in,” she said. “I’m different now; I have different priorities.”\n“This is scary, and I’m going to face this and I’m going to get over it,” she continued. “My mom said to me, ‘Carnie, this is going to be a little hurdle, a little bump, and it’ll all be in the past soon.’ ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T02:40:11.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
