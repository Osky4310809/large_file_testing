Especially when it comes to modern day dating, we face the unique challenge of not talking about things. We like to go with the flow, without questioning or labelling. But, sometimes, situations arise where we are not quite sure what is going on. One such case is when a fuck buddy feels kind of like a boyfriend, or vice versa. Of course, the only way to be sure whether that guy you've been doing the nasty with is just there for some sexy time or more, is to ask him. But, there are some tell tale signs that can help you figure out what he's in it for. A fuck boy will not want to wake up next to you. He might have no problem knocking on your door at 3 a.m., and staying till dawn, as long as you don't fall asleep. Because waking up next to someone is intimate, and he doesn't want to go there! A fuck boy will not call you just to chat. Nope. This one's for those who care about more than just what's between your legs. A fuck boy will always be too busy, or too cool to text you in the middle of the afternoon, or call you on his way back home from work. A fuck boy will not care much about bonding with your friends. If they strike up an independent friendship, that's a different thing. But, he will not want to bond with them, because they are your girl gang. He won't ask about their well-being, or extend friendship to them because it is important to you. A fuck boy will not reference to the future. Yourrelationship might not be serious, butif he is more than a fuck boy, he will want to tell you that he is here to stay, and go wherever this takes the two of you. Referring to the future in jest is one way of doing that. A fuck boy will tell you you're special, but will do nothing to make you feel so . There's a difference between the two. A fuck boy will emphasise on the words, but will not do anything to back the claim. He will not call when he said he would, or go out of his way to be there for you. A fuck boy will not share details about his personal life. Conversation will be superficial, and perfunctory for the sake of sex. It won't have the purpose of connecting and getting to know each other. A fuck boy will not show interest in your life. He will not ask how your day was, or how you're feeling. He doesn't care about your plans, or all the little things that broke your heart as a child. He only cares about one thing. No brownie points for guessing what that is!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:39:50.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
