TMZ reports that they have confirmed earlier suggestions from senior Trump advisors, and the First Family will live under the same roof again sometime in June. \nDespite previous reports suggesting that Melania and Barron Trump wouldn’t move to Washington D.C. at all, White House staff say that the move is “absolutely” happening, and decisions have been made about where Barron will attend school. \nThe Trump family’s continued use of Trump Tower has been a subject of criticism in recent months, with reports stating it has cost millions to maintain the building’s safety while Melania and Barron live there. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has requested $35 million from Congress in order to reimburse the city for security costs. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T02:19:44.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
