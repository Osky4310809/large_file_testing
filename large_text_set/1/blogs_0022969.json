As such, we are handing control of this account over to several activists & journalists who believe they can continue in the same spirit. \n— AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 26, 2017 \nIf you haven’t been following closely, the saga of the rogue government Twitter accounts can be a little confusing. \nThis week, the Trump administration issued gag orders affecting several government agencies , including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Interior Department, which oversees the National Park Service. The orders limited the agencies’ ability to communicate with the public, including through social media postings. These climate tweets by @BadlandsNPS have now been deleted. pic.twitter.com/FR1ejcMall \n— Nathan Rott (@NathanRott) January 24, 2017 \nBut one official National Park Service account, @BadlandsNPS (Badlands Nat’l Park), seemed to be taking a stand against the new administration. The account was tweeting facts about climate change, apparently in defiance of President Trump’s position on the matter. \nWhen those tweets were later deleted, the public cried that government censorship was at hand. \nThe National Park Service, however, issued a statement that explained the tweets had been posted by a former employee who was not supposed to be authorized to use the park’s account: \n“The park was not told to remove the tweets but chose to do so when they realized their account had been compromised. At this time, National Park Service social media managers are encouraged to continue the use of Twitter to post information relating to public safety and park information, with the exception of content related to national policy issues.” \nNot everyone bought this explanation, naturally. \nSoon thereafter, rogue government Twitter accounts representing the oppressed agencies started to appear. \nThe first and most infamous was @AltNatParkSer (AltUSNatParkService), which tweeted defiantly: “Can’t wait for President Trump to call us FAKE NEWS. You can take our official twitter, but you’ll never take our free time!” Can't wait for President Trump to call us FAKE NEWS. \nYou can take our official twitter, but you'll never take our free time! \n— AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017 \nThe account claimed to be run by park rangers, but said they couldn’t identify themselves. \n“…we do not feel it is safe or in the public interest to identify ourselves. We have been advised of this by [several] journalists,” the account tweeted on Wednesday. \nThe whole thing makes for a good story, and one which it’s all too easy to envision: people who have dedicated their lives to protecting the earth, forced into silence by their government, leaving them no choice but to anonymously begin tweeting the truth. What an honour. We're touched! #resist pic.twitter.com/AiYp3mhBqs \n— AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017 \nYet, there has never been proof that @AltNatParkSer was ever run by disgruntled government employees. Journalists tried, and failed, to confirm this. And now, the account says it has handed itself off to “activists and journalists,” which just seems odd. \nFirst of all, if these employees felt so strongly about defying Trump, why ditch the account now that it has worldwide attention? Wouldn’t that have been the end goal? And who are these “reporters” supposedly working with the activists instead of just covering them? \nAnd why does an account that’s now supposedly run by “former scientists” need to employ journalists for fact-checking? Are scientists capable of that? Isn’t factual information the point of science? Several of us are environmental activists and two are journalists [our FACT checkers]. All of us are former scientists. \n— AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 26, 2017 \nThere are a lot of questions here, and still too few answers. \nFor what it’s worth, the account claims they had grown fearful of criminal prosecution, because they were using the NPA’s official logo. One aspect we've had to consider over the past few days are legal ramifications, such as criminal prosecution for the use of the NPA's logo. \n— AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 26, 2017 \nIt’s just as reasonable, though, to assume that the original account holders were fearful that they may end up being exposed as mere activists, not defiant government workers. \nAfter all, the account never verified itself through Twitter or any other trusted third-party – such as through one of these supposed “journalist” partners, or a trusted, independent organization like EFF, as was suggested by VICE’s Motherboard. \nAnd when pressed about its lack of verification, it got a little snippy: Being \"unverified\" by Twitter does NOT discredit any scientist / journalist who wants to work privately outside the office #PrivacyIsARight https://t.co/lvLBDlQxRN \n— AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 26, 2017 \nDespite the lack of proof, many took the account at its word because its existence fits a certain narrative. \nTo further confuse the matter, the popularity of @AltNatParkSer prompted a wave of other “Alt” government accounts to appear. \nSuddenly we had @BadHombreNPS , @AltMtRainierNPS , @RogueNASA , @AltForestServ , @AltHHS , @Alt_FDA , @ActualEPAFacts , @AltUSDA , @AlternativeNWS , and others to track. \nSome of these also claim to be run by government employees, while others explicitly said they are not. Others say they’re operated by a combination of employees and activists, and some say nothing about their creators at all.
