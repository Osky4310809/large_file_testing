He decided to explore global trends from 1992 to 2013 to discover the impact that surfing has on an area. \nThe fastest growing surf breaks from that time period were found in Costa Rica , Peru, Malaysia, Vietnam, and New Zealand. Western Australia also took several top spots. \nAccording to Wills, once surfers discover a high-quality surf break and begin frequenting it, they provide a channel for investment, which then grows to support an entire tourism industry. He specifically pointed to Byron Bay in Australia and Jeffreys Bay in South Africa as tourism centers that once start as small surf towns. \nHowever, the trend also works in reverse: As surf breaks disappear, the tourism surrounding the area also diminishes. \n“Surfers are the trendsetters, then the other tourists follow,” Tarik Senhaji, director-general of the Moroccan Sovereign Wealth Fund, said last year. \nIn other words: If you want to know what’s cool before anybody else, it’s time to pick up a surfboard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:20:46.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
