By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 5, 2017 10:38 AM Air India’s all-women crew after arriving at San Francisco airport. (Source: Twitter) \nIn a historic step, Air India has claimed that it had world’s first passenger journey around the world with an all-women crew last week. According to BBC, the flight departed from New Delhi on Monday for San Francisco and returned to the capital on Friday. The BBC cleared that Boeing 777 flight with an all-women crew flew over the Pacific Ocean during its trip to the United States. However, the return journey was over the Atlantic, encircling the globe. Air India has also revealed that it has claimed for an entry on the Guinness World Record. \nEveryone on the flight starting from the check-in and ground staff, engineers who certified the aircraft and the air traffic controllers who authorised the departure and arrival of the plane were also all women. According to BBC, this wasn’t just one-off flight and Air India is planning to operate more flights like this with an all-women crew. The cabin crew was led by Seema Baberwal and Nishrin Bandulwala. The airline called this trip ‘another feather to Air India’s cap in its constant endeavour to encourage women’. \nYou may also want to watch: \nThis initiative has been taken as part of the celebration of International Women’s Day which is celebrated all across the world on 8th March every year. In January, the carrier also announced that it would reserve six seats for women on all its domestic flights. This decision was taken after there were reports of women passengers being groped by other passengers. The flight was led by Captains Sunita Narula, Kshamta Bajpai, Indira Singh and Gunjan Aggarwal who shared piloting duties on the 15.5 hour long flights. Air India is taking many steps to promote safe journey for female passengers and recently staff were also issued with plastic handcuffs to restrain unruly travellers.
