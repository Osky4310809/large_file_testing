The expectation is that the two sides will remain in conversation in the days to come. \nThe Cowboys have shown interest in McCown as a backup, but there doesn’t seem to be much chance that anything happens on that front until there’s been a resolution to the Tony Romo saga. Absent that move, there might not be much impetus for the Jets to change any offer they may have made while discussing contract parameters with McCown over the weekend. \nThere have been reports of Jets interest in Jay Cutler as well. Cutler has not visited with the team since being released by the Bears.
