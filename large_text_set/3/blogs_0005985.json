Garfield was created by Jim Davis. Garfield is a tabby cat. Garfield is male. These are all things you will learn about Garfield at first glance of the Wikipedia page \"Garfield.\"\nBut what you don't learn is the story behind why there are four cited sources for the cartoon cat's gender.\nImage: wikipedia\nIt all started when Twitter user, and Chapo Trap House podcast member, Virgil Texas found an old Jim Davis interview from Mental Floss that seemed to indicate that Garfield has no gender.\nSEE ALSO: 'Arrival' screenwriter's next act after Oscar nomination? A comic book\nFACT: Garfield has no gender. This. Is. Canon. pic.twitter.com/umm4OmeeVx\n— Virgil Texas (@virgiltexas) February 24, 2017\nHe updated the Garfield Wiki to reflect this new revelation. Texas told The Washington Post that he was only concerned about “Garfield canon\" and folks? I believe him.\nI have updated the Garfield Wikipedia entry to reflect this fact. https://t.co/icgEE6Q11o pic.twitter.com/XUAH3wZkcl\n— Virgil Texas (@virgiltexas) February 24, 2017\nThis did not sit right with the Garfield WIkipedia community apparently, as citations of Garfield's gender began pouring onto the page.\nComic after comic started popping up on the page that Wikipedia users seemed to think proved, definitively, that Garfield is male.\nSomebody added 19 citations of Garfield's gender on the Garfield Wikipedia talk page. https://t.co/pTZx4ThNBD pic.twitter.com/uAIMUZ3ygL\n— Virgil Texas (@virgiltexas) February 26, 2017\nOK but really, who has time to go back through years of old Garfield comics in search of evidence of Garfield's gender? Who is earnestly making these edits on Wikipedia?\nGarfield Wikipedia article edited anonymously from US House of Representatives https://t.co/Hp8vpUNcq1\n— congress-edits (@congressedits) March 1, 2017\nOh.\nThe edit war waged on furiously for 60 hours until Wikipedia was forced to lock the Garfield page in hopes that the heat would die down.\nAfter the controversy made waves on social media, The Washington Post decided to take matters into their own hands and finally get to the bottom of this by reaching out to Jim Davis.\n“Garfield is male,” Davis said . “He has a girlfriend, Arlene.”\nUpon hearing Jim Davis' remarks, Texas backed down, saying on Twitter , \"Jim Davis is the final authority on Garfield canon.\"\nThere will be more fights over Garfield canon ahead of us. So take heart that tomorrow is a new day, and it's not a Monday.\n— Virgil Texas (@virgiltexas) March 1, 2017\nYou can close the book on this one ... for now.\nBONUS: Here's another way to bury your pet — grow it into a tree", "external_links": ["https://t.co/uAIMUZ3ygL", "https://t.co/umm4OmeeVx", "https://twitter.com/virgiltexas/status/834928472162197505", "https://twitter.com/virgiltexas/status/836978471163277312", "https://t.co/Hp8vpUNcq1", "https://garfield.com/comic/2008/01/17", "https://t.co/XUAH3wZkcl", "https://thetrap.fm/", "https://twitter.com/congressedits/status/836990200500871169", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/03/01/is-garfield-a-boy-how-a-cartoon-cats-gender-identity-sparked-a-war-on-wikipedia/?utm_term=.8faf38c5db29", "https://t.co/pTZx4ThNBD", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/TacN939b.m3u8", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/03/01/is-garfield-a-boy-how-a-cartoon-cats-gender-identity-sparked-a-war-on-wikipedia/?utm_term=.7e46070c6a82", "https://twitter.com/virgiltexas/status/835953620302585857", "https://twitter.com/virgiltexas/status/834934656873164800", "https://garfield.com/comic/1980/09/14", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6folbfXnLYukwFzgFGgkcAUqHxA=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F400893%2Fa4bf0524-d7dc-47df-8894-681d64ad87f1.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_(character)", "https://twitter.com/virgiltexas", "https://twitter.com/virgiltexas/status/836980206376271873", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Yw02jFjLLIlSjpe3eXBDl6ILL7g=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F400893%2Fa4bf0524-d7dc-47df-8894-681d64ad87f1.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/TacN939b.jpg", "https://t.co/icgEE6Q11o"], "published": "2017-03-02T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:28:28.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
