Oil pipeline \nThe students demanded that “a standard oil and gas training of the nature and scope approved for us, spanning an average of one year and eight months, of which we have spent only two months.” They specifically urged the Coordinator of PAP, Brig General Paul Boroh (retd.), who they alleged, had almost concluded plans to cancel the oil and gas training programme to jettison the thought. \nThey lamented: “We began the training on December 19, 2015 and were sent home after one week in school for lack of funds as explained by the contractor/vendor, Broadequip. We remained out of school for about five months before we resumed on June 6, 2016, but were again asked to proceed on vacation for one week in August, 2016. This was just barely after two months of studying the introductory theoretical aspects of oil and gas. \n“Sadly, about eight months after, we have not resumed, all those in charge keep saying there is no money. We heard that   in its avowed commitment to the PAP and the Niger Delta, of which oil and gas is pivotal, has released N5bn for the continuity of the oil and gas training programme and other programmes for ex-militants in the Niger Delta. While we thank   for this kind gesture, we shall be very delighted to be back at school.” Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:30:48.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
