AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File \nDAVAO CITY , Philippines – Communist rebels yesterday declared they are terminating their unilateral ceasefire after accusing the government of failing to release all political prisoners and encroaching on rebel-held areas. \nThe Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its military arm, the New People’s Army (NPA), said the Aug. 28 ceasefire would expire Feb. 10. The rebels and the government had separately declared a ceasefire as they resumed their peace talks. \nNPA spokesman Jorge Madlos alias Ka Oris said the government negotiating panel would be given notice of the termination of ceasefire by the National Democratic Front (NDF), the umbrella organization of the CPP-NPA negotiating peace with the government. \nMadlos also cited another reason for the termination was the continuing “encroachment” by the military on what he called “territory of the people’s democratic government.” \n“The Aug. 28, 2016 unilateral declaration of interim ceasefire issued by the Central Committee of the CPP and the National Operations Command of the NPA is hereby terminated,” Madlos said in a statement. \nThe rebel group accused the government of failing to comply with its obligation to amnesty and release all political prisoners under the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law and the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees.   \n“The unilateral ceasefire declaration was issued on the mutual understanding with the government that such releases will take effect within 60 days of Aug. 28,” Madlos said. \n“Such was the context why the government panel approached the NDF towards the end of October seeking an extension of the CPP/NPA’s declaration with a promise that around 200 political prisoners were set to be released,” he added. \nThe termination of the ceasefire came just days after the government and the NDF negotiating panels concluded their third round of talks in Rome. \nThe peace talks in Rome, however, did not result in any ceasefire agreement or release of political prisoners as demanded by the NDF. \nThe termination of the NPA ceasefire also came at a time that President Duterte is standing pat on his stance that he will no longer release any political prisoners despite the demand of the NDF for the release of over 100 political prisoners detained in various jails in the country. \nThe military had accused the NPA of “systematically” attacking government forces in the countryside. \nEven before the latest announcement, the military counted nine rebel attacks since Sunday, including an ambush that killed two soldiers in northern Isabela and a raid on an upscale resort in Batangas province, southwest of the capital, where the guerrillas carted away security guards’ firearms. \nThe NPA made the same accusation against the military by claiming security forces are encroaching on their enclaves. \nMadlos explained that an order has been issued that from today until the expiration of the ceasefire declaration, all commands and units of the NPA are under “active defense” mode. \n“They must counteract, frustrate and punish (military) patrol operations, psywar operations under Oplan Kapayapaan, (military) units occupying barangays and communities and enemy armed offensives posing as anti-drug and anti-crime operations,” Madlos said. \nMadlos, however, gave assurance that the CPP-NPA will continue to support the ongoing peace negotiations with government. \n“Even as we terminate the unilateral declaration of interim ceasefire, we continue to support the peace negotiations within the framework of The Hague Joint Declaration of 1992. In our experience and in the experience of other peoples, it is possible to negotiate while fighting until the substantive agreements are forged to address the roots of the armed conflict and lay the basis for a just and lasting peace,” Madlos said. \nMadlos added they oppose the use of interim ceasefire, saying it is “tantamount to the capitulation and pacification of the revolutionary people and forces.” \nBattle setbacks, surrenders and infighting have weakened the NPA, which is considered a terrorist organization by the United States. \nSporadic fighting has left about 40,000 combatants and civilians dead. – With Gerry Lee-Gorit, Artemio Dumlao, Raymund Catindig, AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:41:39.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
