The Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park is one of London's most exclusive hotels (Photo: Channel 4) \nWorkers rush to unload the LORRY carrying her 200 pieces of luggage and take it to her £7,000-a-night suite. \nThe suite isn't taken as-seen though, it's transformed to meet here every need, including one room being transformed into a playroom for her children and blackout blinds being installed in her bedroom. \nAnd it's not just that one room. The royal guest has also booked additional rooms for her staff, nanny and entourage. \nThe princess racks up a £20,000 bill in just one night, but apparently considers the Mandarin Oriental her home-from-home. \nAnd despite being a much sought-after guest, the princess apparently has a tendency to leave without paying the bill. Concierge Paul hard at work at the Mandarin (Photo: Channel 4) \nBut staff are told that they're \"lucky\" to have the guests stay with them. \nSo how do you get VIP clients to cough up if they haven't settled their tab? \nFront of house manager, Roman Griesshaber, explains that the super rich - unlike us - don't have to leave their credit card details when booking a room. \nHe said: \"One of the many things I learned from dealing with certain royal families is they most likely will not pay their bills straight away.\" \nA previous visit from the princess was not paid and polite requests for the bill to be settled after she'd returned home were ignored, and it took a whole nine months of emails and phone calls for the hotel to finally get the money. A Very British Hotel goes behind the scenes (Photo: Channel 4) \nBut it meant that they were prepared for this visit, with Roman keeping an eye on the princess towards the end of her visit. \nDespite him attempting to bring up the issue of payment with a member of the entourage, the princess yet again leaves without paying. \nRoman added: \"You're not able to tell such people, 'You can't leave the hotel'. That would be a little bit of an issue.\" \nBut he admits he wouldn't allow a 'normal' guest to get away with not paying. That kind of privilege is reserved for a certain kind of customer. \nThe programme is set to be an eye-opener for us regular people. \nEvery single day at the hotel, staff members work around the clock to meet the extravagant requests of their guests. The staff are told they're \"lucky\" to have such important guests (Photo: Channel 4) \nThe more weird and wonderful requests they've received over the years include a bride who once wanted an elephant to attend her party and a delayed businesswoman who asked to have breast milk flown from London to Boston. \nThe show will also see the arrival of some well-known guests, such as actor Morgan Freeman - who says the only demand he has at posh hotels is privacy, author Jilly Cooper and The Rolling Stones' Ronnie Wood. \nIt will also focus on the hotel's staff, including 26-year-old Maksim, from Lithuania, who has only recently been able to afford to move out from his mum's place. \nHe's paid £7.20 an hour and lives in worry that his short-term contract won't be renewed. \nHis duties include pressing socks for clients, with one paying £6.50 to have a pair laundered - surely it would be cheaper to buy a new pair. \nUpgrading to the express service, hotel guests would pay as much as £13 to have their socks cleaned. \n* A Very British Hotel airs at 9pm on Thursday on Channel 4 Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T10:08:04.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
