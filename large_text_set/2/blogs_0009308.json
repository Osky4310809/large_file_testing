Yea yea my 2013 performance at the Grammys was absolute s**t. Technical difficulties, blah blah. Frank Ocean (Photo: Getty Images) \n\"F**k that performance though. You think that's why I kept my work out of the Grammy process this year? Don't you think I would've wanted to play the show to 'redeem' myself if I felt that way? \nHe went on: \"I've actually been tuning into CBS around this time of year for a while to see who gets the top honour and you know what's really not 'great TV' guys? '1989' getting album of the year over To Pimp A Butterfly. Hands down one of the most 'faulty' TV moments I've seen.(sic)\" \nFrank added that the ceremony puts millions of people \"to sleep\" and they're being forced to turn to YouTube to watch their favourite performers from the night. \nHe added: \"Believe the people. Believe the ones who'd rather watch select performances from your program on YouTube the day after because your show puts them to sleep. Use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, I'm one of the best alive.\" Singer Frank Ocean accepts an award onstage (Photo: WireImage) \nGrammy bosses Ken and David hit out at Ocean after he said the show was \"dated\" and out of touch with young black artists, but they believed his gripe was actually over his shoddy 2013 appearance. \nThey told Rolling Stone: \"We executed his vision knowing that it was faulty. And we tried to tell him that, we tried to tell his management that, we tried to tell the record label that. So, his feelings about the Grammys right now, I would imagine, probably go back to that in one way. But honestly, it wasn't us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:30:56.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
