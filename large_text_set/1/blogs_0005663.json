Ahead of the FA Cup clash against Posh, Conte confirmed the news that Terry is likely to return. \n\"Yes [he can play,\" Conte said at a news conference at Cobham Training Centre. \"John is in a good shape and he’s ready to play. He’s doing great work on the pitch and outside the pitch. It’s important to underline this.\" A video posted by John Terry (@johnterry.26) on Dec 29, 2016 at 1:56am PST \nTerry teased that his return was close by posting a goal similar to that of Marco Van Basten's famous volley from the 1988 European Championship final, but Conte was hesitant to confirm for certain that his captain would start - having already named Michy Batshuayi and Kurt Zouma as certainties. \n\"Now we [have named] two players: Michy and Zouma,\" Conte added. \"If we continue maybe you know exactly what our starting XI is!\" \nHowever, Terry is expected to be another name on the team-sheet as Conte will likely rest David Luiz who has played every game in December, despite him carrying a minor injury.
