Russ Burlingame (Photo: The CW /Warner Bros. TV ) \nWhy would he feel the need to take her hostage -- especially when he's apparently (again, based on the trailer) ready to reveal himself as Prometheus to Team Arrow at least? \nThe actor who plays Prometheus (last chance to bail out before SPOILERS , folks) says there's a plan in place. \n\"There is a means to an end for each move that he makes, and that's not part of the Prometheus, that's part of the Chase for me,\" actor Josh Segarra teased reporters during a recent conference call. \"When I look at Prometheus, I look at the skill set that he's out on the streets, and that's taking part of one aspect of this. The part that Chase is doing is a mental game. It's the chess match. That's what Chase has been playing this whole time; he's moving pieces that he knows Oliver's not going to be able to catch up with and I think that Susan is a very, very important piece of that puzzle and Chase knows that, and I think that there are other very important pieces of the puzzle, other pieces on that chess board that he's going to move, and Susan is a very, very important piece and a very good move in the big chess game that's going on. And then to get to see that relationship, how it develops between the two, because you're right â€” Susan may feel betrayed by Oliver so it's interesting to see how Chase will try to let's say navigate those waters, how he can get to his next move.\" \nSo far, Team Arrow doesn't know who Prometheus is, and Green Arrow is a public enemy -- and that gives them a lot of problems to deal with, while they work with a mole in City Hall. Will it be even worse if he manages to turn Oliver's on-again, off-again girlfriend? \nAnd, yes, it seemed she was on the road to reconciliation with Oliver, but let's face it: you can't just turn on a dime when somebody almost ruined your life last week, can you? \nWe'll find out next Wednesday...!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T06:00:45.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
