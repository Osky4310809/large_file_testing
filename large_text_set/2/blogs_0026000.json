It's not that Leicester were over aggressive tonight, I think we were not physical enough. \n\"They were well prepared, they were ready. They had their set pieces well thought out and we were giving throw ins away and what's frustrating is it's not like we didn't talk about that.\" Liverpool were beaten 3-1 at the King Power Stadium (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Klopp said his players were not physical enough against the Foxes (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \n\"The first goal is difficult to accept and it obviously helped them a lot with momentum. It would be hard to explain my disappointment in German but in English its worse.\" \nKlopp reiterated this point in his press conference, telling the media: \"It's easier in a foreign language to talk about victories than about defeats. There's not a lot more to say. \n\"You can ask all the questions but I'm not sure I can explain it better.\" poll loading Should Liverpool sack Jurgen Klopp? 500+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:06:55.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
