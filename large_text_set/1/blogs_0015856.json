Opening with Anthrocene and Jesus Alone from latest album Skeleton Tree , Cave leaned over the crowd as the enormity of the moment settled in. \nThis was just the second Bad Seeds show (the tour opened in Hobart three days ago) since the death of Cave's teenage son in 2015. Songs from the latest album, including the title track, Girl in Amber , and I Need You featured prominently throughout an emotionally charged show, while older songs from the Bad Seeds' back catalogue dug deep into Cave's own heartfelt performance.

Advertisement \nOne More Time With Feeling , the documentary that accompanied the recording of Skeleton Tree , was released in September and like much of Cave's considerable body of work it struck an intense emotional chord with viewers. Live on stage in 2017, stretching his hands towards the crowd, there was an undeniable connection between Cave and those who've watched, listened and more recently, grieved for him and his family. SHARE There were moments of levity too during the performance, the second of the band's Australian tour. Photo: Ballarat Courier \nEllis, who's also one third of the Dirty Three, spent much of the show not far from Cave and smiled occasionally as his friend reached out to those in the front rows, perhaps even acknowledging their support and affection for both him and the stories told through his music. \nOn the other side of the large outdoor stage, longtime touring member Conway Savage was elegantly perched behind his keyboard, while guitarist George Vjestica tore into his strings, such as when the ferocious power of mid '80s song Tupelo was unleashed.Soon afterwards the sheer beauty of The Ship Song and the incredibly delicate Into My Arms highlighted the vast scale of emotions Cave taps into, while Jubilee Street , from 2013's Push the Sky Away album, was another chance for him and the band to explode. SHARE Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Nick Cave and collaborator Warren Ellis took a stroll around Ballarat the night before the gig and sampled the local fish and chips. Photo: Theresa Ambrose \nThomas Wydler's drums rumbled like huge storm clouds rolling across the night sky and Martin P. Casey firmly stood his ground mid-stage, providing the bass lines that have for so long been a staple of the Bad Seeds' aesthetic. New songs Magneto and Distant Sky, the latter featuring the hypnotic recorded vocals of Else Torp, slotted perfectly into the sound and overall mood of the occasion. \nFrom Her to Eternity was a particular highlight on a night when memorable moments kept coming, including stunning versions of The Mercy Seat and Higgs Bosson Blues . There was a brief moment when the still wiry, always theatrical frontman stumbled over the opening words to Red Right Hand but he pressed on, undaunted and seemingly unflappable. \nFans from far and wide joined the many Ballarat locals, spreading themselves out upon colourful rugs or standing closer to the action; singing along loudly when encouraged to do so by Cave; roaring for more when the band vacated the stage after Skeleton Tree . \nReturning for an encore that included an unforgettable version of \"that bad motherf---er\" Stagger Lee and closing song Push the Sky Away , it was clear this performance meant as much to Cave as it did to the fans. \nIndeed, it is good to see Nick Cave playing again. \nNick Cave and the Bad Seeds play ICC Sydney, January 20 & 21; Newcastle Entertainment Centre, January 22; Brisbane Riverstage, January 25; Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Melbourne, January 27 & 28, Adelaide Entertainment Centre, January 29; Perth Arena, January 31.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T15:42:27.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
