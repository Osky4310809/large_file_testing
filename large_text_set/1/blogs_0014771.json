The band will play its farewell show this winter. Photo by Evan Semón for The Know. \nCatching Weezer, Sum 41, the Cranberries and the Spice Girls under one roof in one night in Denver seems like a ’90s mall rat’s dream. \nIt would be, if not for the Gin Doctors. \nFrom massive Halloween shows to rowdy, drink-sloshing UMS sets, the Denver cover band has let our city’s millennials rock out to the music of their teens in public, well beyond their awkward years (for most of us, anyway). \nBut the band was dealt a crushing blow late last year when its co-founder, local singer-songwriter Tyler Depres, died of an aortic aneurysm at the age of 34 . \nThe band has stayed quiet until today, when it took to Facebook to announce its final farewell: a show at Stoney’s Bar and Grill on March 4 at 8 p.m. \nBoth a farewell to the band and Despres, the show will feature special guest performances (including Jen Korte , who will fill in as the band’s fourth member) and looks to fill out a total of four hours with the rose-tinted mixtape jams of your yesteryear. \nThe band accompanied the announcement with a message to its fans, excerpted below. \nW atching this band grow from a tiny first show house party of 20 people to a 1500-person raging Halloween show a few months ago, we are absolutely humbled by the love and support you have given us over the years. You’ve asked us to play your wedding, you voted us Best Tribute Band 2 years in a row, you’ve stood out in the cold waiting on line for 45 minutes to watch us play. And for those reasons, among so many others, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making this band one of the most fun and rewarding experiences of the 4 of our lives. \nRead the whole thing and get more info on the show via the event’s Facebook page . 17", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:31:27.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
