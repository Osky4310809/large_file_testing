It's a bit difficult to experiment with make-up on an occasion like the Oscars, but there are always a brave few who manage throwing in a pigmented eye-shadow, an interesting lip, or cool accessory to complement their amazing gowns. This year, at the 89th Academy Awards, we saw a few beautifully done red lips, sleek hair, fresh faces and glowing skin. Read the list below to see who nailed these best beauty looks. PRIYANKA CHOPRA \nPriyanka won us over with that deep side-parted slick hair! That glowing skin is her best accessory, we think, and is that grey liner we see? EMMA STONE \nEmma picked a red lip that had shades of brown ... closer to an oxblood, we'd say. It worked perfectly with her glowing skin and that brown (do we see hints of gold, too) smoky eye. It's those side-parted old Hollywood waves that really brought the whole thing together, though. ALICIA VIKANDER \nThat messy bun and fresh face? It almost looks like she isn't wearing any make-up! Her skin and smile are absolutely divine. JESSICA BIEL \nJessica's graphic cat eye is ideal for the shape of her eyes. We also love that she has a hint of pale orange eye-shadow on, which matched her muted coral mouth. OLIVIA CULPO \nWe're so in love with that smoky lavender eye. Period. The end. Just a quick check-in about those perfect nude lips too, though. JANELLE MONAE \nJanelle complemented the metallics on her gown with that glorious molten eyeshadow. Ladies, never forget the effect of a strong brow too. Janelle's are defined, but not too coloured in like an Instagram brow! HAILEE STEINFELD \nHailee's did proper red carpet glam, with a brown smoky eye and glossy pink lips. The slicked chignon with the backcombed crown did such justice to the make-up. EMMA ROBERTS \nJust like her namesake, Emma Stone, Emma Roberts also went old Hollywood glam. While the hair is similar (although Ms. Robert's is longer), we can't get over the true red lips. Those are courtesy Charlotte Tilbury's Matte Revolution in Red Carpet Red and Lip Cheat in Kiss 'N' Tell. NAOMIE HARRIS \nNaomi pulled off what is going to be one of 2017's biggest beauty trends: soft pink eyeshadow! She made it work by defining her brows and keeping the rest of her make-up soft and minimal. MICHELLE WILLIAMS \nThat cropped pixie haircut! Those lashes! That peachy-nude lip! The just-flushed cheeks! We're loving it all. TARAJI P. HENSON \nShe's looking so sexy with that teased and tousled ombre bob and the inky navy-lined eyes. Her skin's also kept refreshingly matte, and the lip, neutral. RUTH NEGGA \nWe're applauding Ruth's burgundy eye and wine lips combination! The kohl gives her eyes such depth too, but we really can't stop gazing at the ruby, jeweled headband. The lip apparently is a combination of Chanel's Precision Lip Definer in Rouge Profound and Rouge Allure Ink Matte Liquid Lip Colour in Expérimenté. VIOLA DAVIS \nViola tapped into such a winning combination (and she won an award too!): lots of lashes, eyeliner, glowing skin and a nude, shimmering mouth.
