But her success as a pop star and mom aren't the only things that define the 31-year-old, who is about to give birth to her second child. Ciara opened up to Harper's Bazaar in a new interview about her unconventional childhood, the high expectations she set for herself as a teen, and her passion for giving back. The singer was born in Texas, but moved to places such as Germany, Utah, Arizona, New York, Nevada, and even a trailer home in Monterey, California. She finally settled in Atlanta, where she spent most of her teenage years. In Atlanta, Ciara released her debut album, Goodies , when she was just 19. The album, which included three number one hits: \"Goodies,\" \"1, 2 Step,\" and \"Oh,\" went triple platinum. Most Popular But she knew what was up before she got famous. At the age of 14, Ciara made a goal sheet and told herself, \"you can do whatever you want if you believe in itâ€”period.\" She knew she had talent as a singer and dancer and she knew that she wanted to be a performer, so the young Ciara sought out to make something happen for herself. Ciara set three goals for herself. The first goal was getting discovered, and the second was signing a deal and making a hit album, with the goal of selling 3 to 4 million copies. Four years later, Ciara did just that. \"I signed my first label at 16 years old. I put out my first album at 19, and I sold, not just 3 to 4, but 5 million records,\" she said. But Ciara just didn't want to be a one hit wonder. Her third goal was \"to have longevity,\" she said. \"It's been 13 years since my first album release.\" Done, done, and done. It's no surprise that Ciara has continued to be successful and is currently working on her 7th studio album, but the singer does admit that there is one thing in life she felt she missed out on: \"I didn't get to go to college because of my career. That's the one thing I fantasize about sometimes.\" Though she doesn't have a degree of her own, she works as a volunteer for organizations like I Am That Girl , a community that helps girls to turn \"self-doubt in to self-love.\" She focuses on mentoring groups of girls in their freshman through senior years. As a mentor, the one message Ciara tries to convey is \"that they're not alone in their journey, and that we all essentially experience the same things, we just have a different way to tell the story.\" Read the full interview with Ciara here .
