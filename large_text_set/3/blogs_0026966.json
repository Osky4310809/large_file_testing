Viewers fury as BBC scrap Friday night's episode Fans are furious the \"best episode of the week\" has been scrapped Share Get soaps updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nHit soap EastEnders has been cancelled this evening - to make way for charity marathon Comic Relief. \nViewers of the gritty soap have lashed out at BBC bosses as it marks the third time in as many weeks the show has been cancelled. \nDespite promising to be one the best Red Nose days in recent years - boasting Richard Curtis' Love Actually sequel and a celebrity cross country bike ride - viewers are still devastated not to get their dose of the not so cheery Walford. \nOne furious Danny Dyer fan wrote: \"I get that charity starts at home but what about me and my Mick Carter?\" Another added: \"EastEnders cancelled again - why can't they just move it to BBC 2?\" Whitney and Mick are also probably devastated by the news (Photo: BBC) Danny Dyer is off in very rushed scenes aired last night (Photo: BBC) Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) on set for Red Nose Day Actually (Photo: Comic Relief Ltd) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch Next \n\"EastEnders is starting to get cancelled every week. Nothing's changed there,\" another fan added. \nViewers were eager to find out how the Queen Vic rota is going to work after landlord Mick's rushed exit last night. Walford buffs will know that with Shirley Carter in prison, the already stretched pub rota is running on empty. \nLast night EastEnders viewers witnessed Danny Dyer's last appearance on the show tonight after Mick was forced to book flights to Bulgaria in a \"rushed\" exit. \nMick will fly out to Sofia after daughter Nancy was hit by a car, in a storyline that echoes Danny's own break from the show as he jetted off to South Africa in February. We imagine this look is on a lot of people's faces as they miss EastEnders (Photo: BBC) But fans of Love Actually will be in for a treat! \nThe pub landlord shouted Whitney's name before bursting into the room and saying: \"I need you to look up flights to Sofia. Nancy has been hit by a car in Bulgaria. \n\"I don't want the cheapest flight, I want the earliest flight,\" he demanded. \nBut fans shouldn't worry, EE will be back on our screens on Monday evening at 8pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T13:14:15.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
