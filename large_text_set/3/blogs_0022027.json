PUBLISHED: 14:10, Wed, Mar 22, 2017 | UPDATED: 14:20, Wed, Mar 22, 2017 GETTY • APPLE Pirate Bay users might no longer have a reason to use the site, because of this change \nTorrent websites could be about to lose one of their biggest draws. \nThe hugely-popular websites often host illegal copies of movies at the same time – or soon after – their cinematic release window. \nHowever movie fans could soon be able to download and stream legal copies of films mere weeks after their theatrical debuts. \nAccording to Variety , six of the seven biggest Hollywood studios are pushing to offer customers the chance to watch movies at home weeks after their debut in cinemas. \nWarner Bros is one of the main proponents of the idea – with sources reporting the studio would be happy to roll-out movies to video on-demand services as soon as 17 days after theatrical release. That privilege is expected to come with an eye-watering $50 price tag. \nNot all Hollywood studios believe that this immediacy is the best approach. REVEALED: Most torrented shows on Pirate bay and Kickass Torrents Thu, January 19, 2017 THESE are the top 10 shows that have been illegally downloaded the most on torrent site such as the Pirate Bay and Kickass Torrents 1 of 10 NUMBER 10: The Grand Tour is number 10 in the most downloaded shows \nFox is purportedly proposing a 30 to 45 gap between theatrical release and rental, but with a more reasonable $30 price tag to stream the movie. \nUniversal does not yet have a definitive price, Variety reports, but the studio reportedly wants to make its movies available to home viewers within 20 days of their cinematic debut. \nDisney is not currently interested in shortening the release window, which currently sees rentals become available some 90 days after initial release in cinemas, Variety has claimed. \nThat’s not terribly shocking. \nMany of Disney's biggest properties, including its Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars, and animated movies typically have long runs in theatres. They also have the scope and size that lends itself to the big screen. GETTY Disney is one of the only major Hollywood studios not looking to alter the current release window \nDue to anti-trust laws in the United States, each movie studio will have to individually come to an agreement with theater chains. \nThat causes friction because – understandably – cinema chains are worried that shortened release windows and cheap rental prices could lead to people abandoning the theatre. \nSony is currently in early talks about bringing forward the release of its movies on video on-demand services. \nHowever the studio is believed to be in favour of an early on-demand debut with a high price point, like the proposal being floated by the likes of Universal. \nDownloading copyrighted material from torrent websites is illegal. \nThe news comes as UK Internet Service Providers, ISPs, are mailing out warning letters to subscribers whose accounts have been used to download copyrighted material from torrent sites. \nThe emails are part of a new campaign called Get It Right . GET IT RIGHT Carrie Fletcher highlights the importance of copyright for the Get It Right campaign \nThe campaign has a new website that provides answers to some of the most asked questions about torrents, peer-to-peer sharing, and copyright material. \nIn an effort to lower piracy rates across the UK, leading Internet service providers will send out emails from the Get It Right campaign to those who have download copyrighted material online. The email cautions subscribers they have 20 days to stop downloading copyrighted material using peer-to-peer websites. \nShould your Internet service provider detect more illegal activity from your IP address during the 20 day grace period – another educational email from the Get It Right campaign will be sent. \nA similar campaign in the United States only offers torrent site users seven-days to comply. \nAccording to the campaign website, \"The Get it Right Educational Email programme is designed to educate consumers about what’s happening on their Internet Service Provider (ISP) account. \n\"The programme is to help to make sure they, or people that use their connection, are not infringing copyright and to direct them to sources where they get the content they want from genuine sites and services.\" \nBT, NowTV, PlusNet, Sky, Talk-Talk and Virgin Media are all signed-up to the Get It Right campaign.
