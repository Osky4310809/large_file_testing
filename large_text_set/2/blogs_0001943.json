Set for its public debut at the Geneva Motor Show next month, the G31 5 Series Touring aims to bring technology introduced on the G30 sedan along with weight savings and efficiency improvements, to the tune of up to 100 kg and 11% respectively. \nExterior-wise, the front of the 5 Series Touring is basically identical to the sedan’s, and the belt line and “hockey stick” from the G30 sedan – itself borrowing said cues from the G11/12 7 Series – is also carried over to the Touring. \nMeasuring 4,942 mm long, 1,868 mm wide and 1,464 mm tall with a 2,975 mm wheelbase, the G31 5 Series Touring is 6 mm longer and 15 mm lower than the G30 sedan; width and wheelbase are identical. As expected, the 5 Series Touring will have a powertrain line-up that almost mirrors that of the sedan when it was launched, with two petrols and two diesels to begin with – the 530i, the 540i xDrive, the 520d, and the 530d xDrive. \nThe 530i Touring is powered by a 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine paired to an eight-speed transmission, producing 252 hp at 5,200–6,500 rpm and 350 Nm at 1,450–4,800 rpm, giving performance figures of a 6.5 second 0-100 km/h sprint time – 0.3 second slower than the sedan, with a top speed of 250 km/h. Combined fuel consumption is rated at 5.8 L/100 km, 0.4L/100 km more thirsty the sedan. \nThe sole six-cylinder petrol unit at the 5 Series Touring’s debut in the 540i xDrive is a 3.0 litre turbocharged inline-six mated to an eight-speed auto and all-wheel-drive, producing 340 hp at 5,500-6,500 rpm and 450 Nm of torque at 1,380-5,200 rpm. \nKicking off the diesel range for the 5 Series Touring is the 520d – as on the 520d sedan, the Touring in this guise is powered by a 2.0 litre, four-cylinder turbodiesel producing 190 hp at 4,000 rpm and 400 Nm of torque at 1,750-2,500 rpm. \nDrive is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission or six-speed manual, driving the 520d through the 0-100 km/h acceleration benchmark in 7.8 seconds (eight seconds for the manual), onwards to a top speed of 225 km/h (230km/h in the manual). Combined fuel consumption is rated at 4.3L/100 km. \nRounding out the four variants at launch is the 530d Touring and 530d xDrive Touring, which is powered by a 3.0 litre turbodiesel pumping 265 hp at 4,000 rpm and 620 Nm of torque at 2,000-2,500 rpm. Drive is sent to the rear wheels or all four wheels via an eight-speed auto; the 0-100 km/h run is elapsed in 5.8 seconds (xDrive – 5.6 seconds), while top speed is 250 km/h. Combined fuel consumption is rated at 4.7L/100 km (xDrive – 5.3L/100 km). \nAs with the G30 sedan, the G31 5 Series Touring features LED headlamps as standard. Inside, the front half of the cabin is identical to the sedan’s, with similar levels of equipment on offer. a 10.25-inch touchscreen displays tile-style control pads with customisable content, plus voice command and gesture control as on the sedan. Also carried over to the Touring is the heads-up display with a 70% larger projection surface area. \nThe 5 Series Touring gains similar advances towards automated driving as well, with the Lane Change Assistant and Lane Keeping Assistant offering steering and lane control assistance anywhere from walking pace up to 210 km/h. Changing speed restrictions are taken into account, with Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function providing speed limit information at the touch of a button. \nVehicle automation on the 5 Series Touring also extends to parking situations, courtesy of the Parking Assistant and the Remote Control Parking function as seen on the 5 Series sedan. Also where applicable, the ParkNow service enables online reservation of parking spaces and cashless payment. Meanwhile, the On-Street Parking Information service helps the G31 driver locate vacant on-street parking.
