In other words, what you do using your home or cellphone internet connection will become a product that the Verizons, AT&Ts or Spectrums of the world can sell to marketing agencies for a good buck unless you opt-out. \nIn essence, internet providers won't have to care about your privacy anymore and that kinda sucks—but you can do something about it . \nRead more: The Motherboard Guide To Not Getting Hacked \nThe easiest way is to use a commercial Virtual Private Network or VPN. The bad news is that there are dozens if not hundreds of commercial VPNs out there, and as reporter Yael Grauer explained last year , it's near impossible to say which one is the best. \nAlso, it's important to remember that VPNs are not a silver bullet, but they a good choice if you are trying to hide your internet browsing from your provider. Now, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation warns in a guide , when you're using a commercial VPN, the company that provides the service can see the data that you're hiding from your home broadband or cellphone company. So keep that in mind. \nSo what should you use? We don't have a definitive answer, but most cybersecurity experts and hackers I've spoken to over the last couple of years have told me that Freedome or Private Internet Access (PIA) are the easiest ones to use and have a good track record of respecting your privacy, by not keeping logs, for example. Commercial VPNs like Freedome or PIA have a cost, usually relatively cheap (between $4 and $8 a month). But if you don't want to pay, you can use the Tor Browser , but that doesn't tunnel all your internet connections—just your browsing. Moreover, Tor is a bit harder to use on mobile, as there aren't great apps for Android and iOS, though developers have been working on making a good Tor browser app for iPhones. \nIdeally, if you have a little bit more technical skills and don't want to use a plug-n-play commercial service, you could set up an OpenVPN tunnel to your own Virtual Private Server (VPS), which you can lease on hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Digital Ocean. This way, you don't have to trust the VPN company providing the service, and you have more control. \nThere are also tools that make it a bit easier to configure and run your own proxy or VPN-like service, such as Streisand , and Algo , a new project that's open-source, relatively easy to set up, and can cost just as little as a commercial VPN. \nSubscribe to pluspluspodcast , Motherboard's new show about the people and machines that are building our future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:34:21.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
