But it’s even better when that athlete thanks both their significant others.\nSouth African Premier League player Mohammed Anas did just that after winning Man of the Match in a contest over the weekend.

He proceeded to shower the love on thick for his wife.\nUnfortunately for him, the damage was likely already done.\nIt’s possible Anas was referring to the same person here (after all, most wives are formerly known as girlfriends) and just slipped up, but it’s more fun to imagine this being one wild act of self-sabotage.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:11:53.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
