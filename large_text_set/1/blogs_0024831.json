As rivals like Jawbone grapple with the future and the smartwatch space looks dismal, however, the Fitbit has been making acquisitions, including the once promising smartwatch pioneer Pebble, which met with its own struggles as the year drew to a close. \nThe financials detail 6.5 million devices sold for the fourth quarter of last year, with quarterly revenue and annual revenue growth both falling below the company’s guidance range. \nCEO James Park addressed the slower than expected holiday season in the release, insisting that the slowdown is “temporary” and the result of a “transitional period for Fitbit.” \nLooking forward, we believe Fitbit is in a unique position to stimulate new areas of demand by leveraging the data we collect to deliver a more personalized experience while developing upgraded versions of existing products and launching additional products to expand into new categories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T16:53:59.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
