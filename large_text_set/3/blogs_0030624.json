Growing a human inside you is no easy feat, and all the moms out there deserve recognition for being bad ass. Bar Refaeli is one such bad ass mama, who just surprised the internet with the news she’s going to be a mom again, and this time just seven months after giving birth to her first child, Liv. The Israeli model mogul and her husband Adi Ezra just announced the newest addition to the family, posting on Instagram (where else) to announce the news.\nSomething's cooking ... \nA post shared by Bar Refaeli (@barrefaeli) on Mar 28, 2017 at 6:29am PDT \nSomething’s cooking indeed, and this time it’s a friend for Liv! Although Bar doesn’t post many photos of her family on her Instagram, you can see she’s found a balance between being a model and a mother, still posing for the covers of magazines like Elle and GQ in between snuggle sessions with her husband.

Waiting a shorter time increases the possibility that your baby could be born premature, which may lead to other health issues.\nYou can come out now .. I'm ready. And heavy. \nA post shared by Bar Refaeli (@barrefaeli) on Jul 31, 2016 at 10:32am PDT \nWe’re hoping that the couple’s new baby is healthy and happy!
