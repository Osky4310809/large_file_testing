Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA sex toy company has been ordered to pay a fine of £2.4 million, after shipping a \"smart vibrator\" that tracked customers' usage without their knowledge. \nThe We-Vibe 4 Plus is a £90 vibrator that connects to a smartphone app via Bluetooth, allowing the user's partner to operate the device remotely, from anywhere in the world. \nAt the Def Con hacking conference last year, two hackers revealed that data from the devices was being sent back to Standard Innovation , the company behind the We-Vibe. \nThis included minute-by-minute temperature changes on the device, dates and times of use, and vibration intensity, revealing intimate information about the user's sexual habits. \nThe hackers warned that this information was being stored on Standard Innovation's servers, along with personally-identifiable information such as email addresses. We-Vibe sex toy \nAt the time, Standard Innovation claimed that the data was collected solely for \"diagnostic purposes\". \nHowever, two women filed a lawsuit against Standard Innovation one month after the Def Con presentation, alleging that the company failed to \"notify or warn\" users of the data collection. \nThe suit, filed in an Illinois federal court, accused Standard Innovation of violating the Federal Wiretap Act, along with other privacy and consumer protection statutes. \nNow the company has been ordered to pay a total of 4 million Canadian dollars (£2.4 million) in compensation - or C$10,000 per customer. \nThose who used the vibrator's associated app, We-Connect, are entitled to the full amount, while those who simply bought the vibrator can claim up to C$199.
