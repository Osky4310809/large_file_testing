Relentless hard work,\" was the response from Cowley when asked about the recipe for his success. \nBut there's a bit more to it than that. BBC Sport has pulled out Cowley's stellar statistics and compared them with the biggest names in the game. Among Premier League piers \nUnder Cowley, Lincoln's league record in the National League has been remarkable this season, winning 22 of 34 games, losing six, and scoring 67 goals while conceding just 32. \nHis win percentage of 64.71%, while of course achieved in a different league played at a very different standard, stands up impressively against the elite of the Premier League, with only Antonio Conte having a better success rate this term. Click to see content: cowley_1season \nAnd if you take into consideration Cowley's past two seasons - having taken part-timers Braintree to third in the National League and the play-offs, he trumps any Premier League boss to have managed in the top flight across the past two seasons. Click to see content: cowley_2seasons \nGiven their record over the past 19 months, it will come as no surprise that the Cowley brothers have accrued a standout points-per-game average - in fact their average of 1.9 points per game for the past two seasons is bettered by no Premier League manager. \nAnd only Conte has a better points average this season, with 2.4 to the Cowleys' 2.10. Championship? You're having a laugh \nOne for Lincoln City fans to savour. \nWith victories over Ipswich and Brighton in the FA Cup, the Imps have beaten more Championship clubs in 2017 than actual Championship teams Rotherham and Bristol City. \nAnd they've beaten the same number of Championship clubs in 2017 as have Championship teams Ipswich, Wolves and Birmingham City. \nIf Lincoln had picked up points in their FA Cup draw with Ipswich and subsequent wins over Town and Brighton, they would have three more points than Rotherham have picked up in their 12 games in 2017. Lincoln have two wins and one draw against Championship clubs in 2017 - Rotherham have one win and one draw from 12 games Just the 103 years in the making \nBy reaching the quarter-finals, Cowley and his side became the first non-leaguers to go into the last eight since QPR in 1914 - a year before Woolwich Arsenal filed the paperwork to change their name to plain Arsenal. \nIn that time, the Gunners have won 13 top-flight league titles, 12 FA Cups, two League Cups and a European Cup Winners' Cup. \nIn short - Lincoln's achievement is a once-in-a-lifetime event. \nOver the same period, Lincoln have won the old Division Three North three times, League Two once and the National League once - as well as 38 Lincolnshire Senior Cup titles. Lincoln haven't done it the easy way \nLincoln have been throwing around cup upsets like confetti this season - and none were as impressive as beating top-flight Burnley in the fifth round. \nThe Clarets were a mammoth 81 places higher than the National League leaders at the time of the match. \nIpswich, Lincoln's third-round victims, were 59 places higher and Brighton, the highly fancied Championship promotion chasers, were 71 places higher when they were vanquished in the fourth round. \nLincoln, the 93rd-ranked team in English football, have knocked out teams with an average position of 23rd on the ladder since the third round - 70 spots above their current standing. \nOf the remaining quarter-finalists, only Manchester City (average position of opponents 18th) and Millwall (13th) have had tougher runs from the third round in terms of how high their opponents are ranked.
