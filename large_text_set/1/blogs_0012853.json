I imagine that women could have the same space and authority as men. I imagine women as vitruvian men: I imagine that they can be themselves and also represent humanity. and I think my work is an attempt at making visible the way we feel and exist within ourselves.’ \n4th floor to mildness, 2016 \nadministrating eternity, 2011four-channel video installation, silent, color, with two moving mirrors and curtains; 9:29 min / 12:27 min / 5:35 min / 5:47 min. | dimensions variablecourtesy the artist, collection kunstmuseum st. gallen \ninstallation view, includes single-channel video installations \ninstallation view, includes single-channel video installations \nmassachusetts chandelier, 2010two-channel video installation, silent, color, with chandelier made of used and washed underpants with one centrally placed lightbulb; 5:32 minutes | height: 98 3/8 in (250 cm); diameter: 66 1/8 in (168 cm)collection marguerite steed hoffman and deedie rose \nvorstadthirn (suburb brain), 1999three-channel video and sound installation, color, with miniature model of a suburban residential area containing various objects; 8:52 min / 6:53 min / 12:44 min | dimensions variablecourtesy the artist, friedrich christian flick collection im hamburger bahnhof, berlin \nvorstadthirn (suburb brain), 1999 \nnichts (nothing), 1999metal housing containing two twenty-five-liter holding tanks, soap fluid, fog fluid, motor, bubble ring, front tank, pump, fog machine, ventilator, electronic timing elements, and fan | 57 7/8 x 55 1/8 x 37 3/8 in (147 x 140 x 95 cm)courtesy the artist, private collection, switzerland \nopen my glade (flatten), 2000 © pipilotti ristsingle-channel video installation, silent, color; 9:07 mincourtesy the artist, hauser & wirth, and luhring augustine \nopen my glade (flatten), 2000 nina azzarello I designboom", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:55:22.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
