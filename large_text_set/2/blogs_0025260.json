This situation has now been redressed with the launch of the 2017 Yamaha MT-10 Tourer in Europe, scheduled for March. \nComing with ABS soft cases as standard, as well as a tall sports screen, the MT-10 Tourer is designed to fit a niche between the MT-10 naked sportsbike and the Yamah Tenere dual-purpose tourer. Other equipment designed to make Yamaha’s range-topping naked bike a sports tourer include hand-guards and a comfort seat for long miles in the saddle. \nCarrying a de-tuned version of the 998 cc Crossplane engine taken from the Yamaha R1, the MT-10 Tourer puts out a claimed 158 hp at 11,500 rpm and 111 Nm of torque at 9,000 rpm. This compares against the R1’s engine, which pumps out a claimed 200 hp at 13,500 rpm and 112 Nm of torque at 11,500 rpm. \nStandard equipment is Yamaha’s D-MODE that offers the rider three ride modes that are adjusted using throttle opening, ignition timing and fuel injection volume. Part of the MT-10 Tourer’s electronic package is traction control, and a quickshifter that allows for clutchless upshifts. \nAlso in the MT-10 Tourer’s specifications package is cruise control, and an assist and slipper clutch that lowers lever clutch lever effort and prevents rear wheel hop under shifting down hard through the gearbox. As per the standard MT-1o, the Tourer comes with adjustable suspension front and rear, with the front end being propped up by KYB upside-down forks. \nThere are three colour options available for Yamaha’s litre-class tourer – Tech Black, Race Blu and Night FLuo. An extensive range of accessories for the 210 kg MT-10 Tourer is also available from the official Yamaha catalogue. \nNo pricing has been released for the 2017 Yamaha MT-10 Tourer as yet, but the base model Yamaha MT-10 retails in the UK for 10,799 pounds sterling (RM59,626). The MT-10 is not officially imported into Malaysia, and sources in Hong Leong Yamaha Malaysia tell us Yamaha’s premier naked sportsbike is not likely to make it to our shores, less so the Tourer version. \nWhat Malaysian riders do get is the 849 cc, three-cylinder Yamaha MT-09 Tracer that produces 113 hp at 10,000 rpm and 93 Nm torque at 8,500 rpm, and retails for RM59,900. What do you think? Should Hong Leong Ymaha Malaysia bring in the MT-10 series bikes and take the fight to the Kawazaki Z1000, Suzuki GSX-R 1000, BMW S1000 R and the rest?
