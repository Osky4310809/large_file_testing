She later died. \nThe hospital issued a statement, Thursday, saying that they value patient safety and quality of care. \n“We are continuously focused on maintaining and improving our high standards of care and we have put programs in place to help ensure that these high standards are met,” the statement said. “Our heartfelt sympathy continues to go out to the patient’s family and friends. This was a very difficult time for them as well as for the many physicians, nurses and technicians who provided compassionate care to the patient at the hospital two years ago.” \nSouth Coast Global Medical Center was fined in connection with the death of a patient in January 2014,which officials say occurred because nursing staff failed to follow treatment procedures after the patient had been hospitalized twice for colon blockage. According to documents, the patient suffered a ruptured bowel, cardiac arrest, underwent surgery and eventually died. \nFollowing this incident, the hospital immediately developed and implemented a plan to address inadequacies that contributed to the failure, spokesman Jeff Corless said Thursday. \n“The hospital will always remain accountable to the patients and the communities it serves,” he said. “(We) take matters of this nature very seriously and remain committed to ensuring patient caregivers adhere to strict policies and procedures that reflect the highest standard of practice and prevent the ‘unacceptable’ from happening.” \nSt. Joseph Hospital was fined in connection with a surgical fire in January 2015 that left a patient with second- and third-degree burns to the face and nasal passages. In a statement, Thursday, the hospital referred to the incident as “unfortunate and unusual.” \n“The circumstances were reviewed and additional actions were taken to prevent this type of incident from occurring in the future,” according to the statement. “St. Joseph Hospital remains committed to providing the highest level of care and safety to our patients and our community.” \nContact the writer: 714-796-7909 or", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:20:06.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
