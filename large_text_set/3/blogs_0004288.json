Chaos and fighting \nProduction has recently been fluctuating around 700,000 barrels per day (bpd), but remains far below the 1.6 million bpd Libya was pumping before the 2011 uprising that toppled its longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi. \nSince then, the North African country has been riven by chaos and factional fighting. \nThe LNA has been waging a military campaign for nearly three years against Islamists and other opponents in the eastern city. \n\"Haftar claims to control most of the eastern part of Libya around Benghazi,\" Oliver Miles, a former British ambassador to Libya, told Al Jazeera. \n\"But control is a loose word. He's been fighting for a long time to deal with them, and it has taken a long time time to clear them up. He's repeatedly said they've dealt with the problem but they keep reuniting.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:33:56.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
