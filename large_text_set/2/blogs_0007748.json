They’ve won 11 straight games, all in Big Ten play. \nThe team has a lot of offensive options and Coach Frese is very thankful for that. So what do they look for while building a team? \nWhen looking for recruits for the program, Coach Brenda Frese says, “there’s a lot that goes into it. They’ve got to be able to play at the level talent wise for us at Maryland, but we’re really selective. We’re not going to choose a player with a bad attitude and we watch the parents in the stands…and sometimes that’s an element for us that we watch closely. We share the basketball here and we’re unselfish.” \nThe hard-working, third-ranked Maryland women’s basketball team’s Feb. 26 match up with Minnesota will be at noon ET at the XFINITY Center on the Terrapins’ annual Senior Day. \nTune in to hear the full interview below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:57:26.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
