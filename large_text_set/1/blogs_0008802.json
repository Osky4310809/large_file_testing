Joe Carnahan ( The A-Team ) posted an image of its title page yesterday to Instagram, calling it \"monstrously cool\" and \"a BEAST.\" Carnahan was brought aboard this summer to take a crack at an Uncharted adaptation, which has been chewed over since 2009. A photo posted by Joe Carnahan (@carnojoe) on Jan 7, 2017 at 1:28pm PST Sony and producers Avi and Ari Arad have gone through at least three potential directors and two writing teams since then, and was supposed to begin filming in 2015. The script completion could mean filming will begin this year , as current director Shawn Levy indicated back in November. PlayStation’s Uncharted franchise is universally fawned over as among the most cinematic and sophisticated in video gaming, but when interactivity is taken out of the experience, even the best video game's plot holes and dialogue clichés become a lot more stark.

Most video game adaptations still make a boatload of money . However, the best-reviewed live-action video game movie on Rotten Tomatoes is 2010's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (36 percent \"fresh\"). On Metacritic , it's 1995's Mortal Kombat (58).
