That will increase competition for fewer places for national associations. \nCeferin said: “I am very pleased that the executive committee gave a unanimous backing to reforms I consider essential for the strengthening of UEFA and which formed a key pillar of my presidential manifesto. \n“I am convinced that our member associations will also endorse these good governance proposals to create a stronger and more transparent governing body for the good of European football.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:22:21.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
