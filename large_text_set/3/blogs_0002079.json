Recently, one fan traded his nearly decade-old beard for a puck from the young Oilers superstar. \nNick Cordell said he hadn’t been clean shaven since 2008 but was willing to part with his huge beard if it meant a prize from McDavid, so he brought a sign to Tuesday’s Blues-Oilers game in St. Louis making that proposal. @cmcdavid97 @EdmontonOilers my wife doesn't think I will do this, let's prove her wrong!! See you on St Louis tomorrow night!!! pic.twitter.com/ljRAxE0pSR \n— nick cordell (@ZamboniDriver17) February 27, 2017 \nLuckily for Cordell (but unfortunately for his beard), McDavid obliged. \n— nick cordell (@ZamboniDriver17) March 1, 2017 \nSomething tells me it might take a little bit for Cordell to get adjusted to that new look — especially when the winter temperatures drop — but it’s worth it. Hair grows back, but a McDavid souvenir is forever. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:30:26.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
