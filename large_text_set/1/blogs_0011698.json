We'll see what emerges.\" \nAt the same time, Pelosi said she questions Trump's views about Russia and his decision to nominate former Exxon Mobile CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. Tillerson has spoken out against sanctions, although at a Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday he said his opposition stems from the sanctions hurting U.S. businesses. \nPelosi called the sanctions \"essential to our national security,\" and questioned why Trump would back Tillerson.
