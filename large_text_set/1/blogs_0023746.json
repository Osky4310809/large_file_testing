Could the anti-Trump petition stop Donald Trump from visiting the UK? MORE than 1.3 million Britons have signed a petition calling for Donald Trump’s state visit to be cancelled. But will it stop the new US President coming to the UK? PUBLISHED: 16:42, Mon, Jan 30, 2017 | UPDATED: 16:51, Mon, Jan 30, 2017 PA AFP Getty Could this petition stop Donald Trump from visiting the Queen? \nParliament will have to consider the anti-Trump petition for debate because it has surpassed the threshold of 100,000 signatures many times over. \nIt comes after Donald Trump provoked global outrage by banning travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa. \nDespite anti-Trump protests across the UK this evening, the Government is still refusing to withdraw the invitation of a state visit for the new US President. \nDowning Street said the Mr Trump’s state visit will not be cancelled because it remains “substantially in the national interest”.
