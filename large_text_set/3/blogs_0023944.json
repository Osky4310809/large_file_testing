He said Medium would offer paid memberships to everyone in the next few weeks, but that it was currently only inviting members who \"meet certain criteria.\" \nFor $5 a month, which Williams noted was an introductory price, Medium members will get exclusive stories, a \"first look at newest reading features\" as well as a special offline reading list. \n\"We need a system that funds stories and ideas not just based on their ability to attract attention, but on their value to readers. This is the system that Medium is building, and as a founding member, you’ll get to help tell us what’s most valuable and how we spend that money,\" Williams said in the post. \n\"Let’s stop relying on ad buyers and social media echo chambers to determine what we put in our brains — which is just as important, or more so, than what we put in our bodies,\" Williams said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:43:59.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
