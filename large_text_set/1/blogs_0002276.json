Let us find the courage needed to take all necessary measures and to protect in every way the lives of our children, so that such crimes may never be repeated. In this area, let us adhere, clearly and faithfully, to ‘zero tolerance’ ,” he said. \nA few thoughts about that… \n1) If you still have to tell Catholic leaders that child abuse will not be tolerated, there’s still a very real problem within the Church. \n2) Was zero tolerance ever not an option?! \n3) Why not find some “divine inspiration” and change some of the archaic rules for priests that require celibacy, forbid marriage, and ban same-sex relationships? Those supposed “sins” are among the reasons some priests resort to abusing children. They need an outlet for their desires that is both legal and moral. \n4) What is the Vatican doing to punish not just those who commit these crimes but anyone involved in covering them up? \n5) When the Church does more to punish pedophile priests than it does to prevent women from having access to birth control and abortion clinics, then I’ll take the Pope more seriously. Until then, his rhetoric means nothing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T02:07:07.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
