In fact, parents who try tricks like cutting up a carrot super thinly and adding it to mac and cheese are not to be trusted. \nSo, naturally, I am very conflicted with Vegedeco Salads . \nInstead of overdosing on sugar, when you bite into a “salad cake” you just get your daily recommended serving of vegetables. \nMitsuki Moriyasu invented the salads as a guilt-free alternative to baked goods. Normally, I would say this is an act against nature! But these cakes actually look pretty delicious. \nInstead of traditional sugar frosting, it is made out of tofu. The “sponge” is made of soy powder, eggs and vegetable oil. The rest of the decorations are veggies and colored using juice from beetroot and other healthy sources. \nMoriyasu says, \nIt looks like a normal cake — but it’s made of only veggies. You can have it for breakfast, lunch — and it’s very suitable for dinner with wine. \nEach cake tastes different, depending which vegetables we use — but I would say it tastes like something you’ve never had before. \nMoriyasu was originally inspired to create the healthy treats for her sons who both have food allergies. She said, \nWe had homemade meals as I wanted them to eat lots of vegetables, and not take too much sugar. \nI decided I wanted to make something that looks cute, and also has lots of vegetables. So I made a cake — but with lots of veggies. \nThe salad cakes are also low carb and gluten free. \nOne slice of cake is only 193 calories. Meanwhile, a cranberry orange scone from Starbucks is 420 calories. (Haha, blaze it.) \nWhile this certainly feels like a deception of the worst kind, I have to admit I’d probably eat six or seven slices worth.
