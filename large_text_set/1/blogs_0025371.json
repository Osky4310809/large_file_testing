If marketers are owed by the government, I believe they have a right to demand for the debt and the government also has a responsibility to pay these marketers. \n“But my basic concern here is that must we continue to talk about increasing the price of fuel? The economic situation is biting in the sense that things are hard; economically we cannot move forward and yet somebody wants to wake up one morning and say the only option they want to apply is to talk about increasing fuel price, because you are being owed or because you want to make profits.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T03:08:13.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
