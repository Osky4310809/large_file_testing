District maps now look like Rorschach tests and serve to insulate incumbents from serious challengers. These sweetheart districts — which both Democrats and Republicans routinely encourage — effectively undermine democracy and promote gridlock because incumbents don't have to be answerable to all constituents. \nIt is time to make congressional and state legislative redistricting in Texas a less partisan political process and establish an independent, bipartisan commission to draw district boundaries, rather than the Legislature. We urge Austin lawmakers to take a serious look at HB 369 , from Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, and SB 209 , from Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, to cut way back on these partisan shenanigans. Editorial: Let’s drop incumbents’ protected status \nEvery 10 years, after each U.S. census, district lines are redrawn block by block to reflect changes in population. Some districts gain residents, others lose — but boundaries are supposed to make sure that each district has about the same number of people, is compact, includes people with common interests and gives voters an equal say. \nUnfortunately, partisan redistricting usually starts with lawmakers drawing their residence on a map, to ensure that districts are drawn in a way that protects incumbents. Boundaries then are manipulated to maximize the number of districts favorable to one party while herding as many of the other guys as possible into the remaining districts. Who benefits? The political parties and incumbents drawing the lines. Who loses? Challengers and voters. Editorial: Legislature needs a new way to do redistricting \nThe results are mind-boggling. State Senate District 12, represented by Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, is one of the more oddly shaped districts in the state, stretching from about the Denton-Collin County line to south of White Settlement in Tarrant County and west almost to the Tarrant-Parker County line. And U.S. Rep. Roger Williams' 25th Congressional District runs through Central Texas from near Fort Worth to about San Marcos. So much for preserving compact districts and common interests. \nDemocracy suffers. Incumbents often feel no pressure to campaign seriously in all parts of their district. Challengers face an uphill climb in party primaries and an even steeper climb in general elections. How does a newcomer grab votes in a district strategically packed with voters of the other party or one that is so far-flung that it's nearly impossible to campaign and meet constituents in the furthest reaches? Many incumbents run unopposed election after election, leaving voters without meaningful choices. Texas accused of purposely excluding minorities in redistricting \nVoters should demand that lawmakers establish an independent commission to preserve the integrity of the ballot box. Incumbents are betting that the lack of choices and voter apathy will guarantee re-election victory after re-election victory, even if they haven't done enough to warrant another term. \nVoters should pick their politicians. Politicians shouldn't pick their voters. What you can do \nContact your legislator to register your support for SB 209 and HB 369, which would create an independent redistricting commission in Texas, pending voter approval of a constitutional amendment (HJR 32). To find out who represents you and how to contact them, go to www.fyi.legis.state.tx.us/Home.aspx and type in your address. \nEmail forms are available on each lawmaker's website. Find them at www.house.state.tx.us/members and www.senate.state.tx.us/", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:57:43.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
