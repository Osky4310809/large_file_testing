Here’s how to make that magical cocktail and other favorites from the series. Advertisement \nAs explained in this video from the Cocktail Chemistry YouTube channel , the “Flaming Homer” on the show is an oddball mix of tequila, peppermint schnapps, crème de menthe, a few other random liquors, and, of course, its trademark ingredient: grape cough syrup. As expected, this recipe tastes disgusting, and, unfortunately, the concoction won’t even light aflame. We’ll never know if fire actually makes it good. \nSo, to make a more drinkable “Flaming Homer,” Cocktail Chemistry recommends you use triple sec, gin, lime juice, and crème de violette instead of grape cough syrup. Shake it up with ice, pour it into a cocktail glass, and use the juiced lime half as a boat. Float the lime on top of the cocktail, fill it with some Bacardi 151, then light it up. Your modern “Flaming Homer” is ready to drink. Cocktail Chemistry also goes over how to make Skittlebräu—both the real version and a modern take—and another surprise drink you probably shouldn’t try, so be sure to stay tuned through the end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:13:42.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
