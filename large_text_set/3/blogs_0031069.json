With Mick away at Nancy’s side following an accident, Linda caring for Elaine, Lee having moved away and Shirley inside, Tina, Johnny and Whitney have been trying to hold everything together but continue to be hit by torment. \nThey look set to finally get some support though as Shirley is up for release. Tina visits her in prison ahead of time for a talk with her about everything that has happened in her absence and also to talk about her coming home.\n(Picture: BBC) As an unexpected friend reaches out to Tina, she is touched by everyone’s assistance and thrilled when Johnny and Whitney put together a party for Shirley and create a welcome home banner. Meanwhile, Konrad arrives with a gift he will know Shirley will love and need – vodka!\nAs the date arrives for Shirley’s homecoming, is there finally something for the Carter clan to smile about?\nOne to watch: Friday 7th April at 8pm on BBC One.
