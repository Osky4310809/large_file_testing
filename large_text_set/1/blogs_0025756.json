As Vogue.com’s Michelle Ruiz pointed out , Obama’s tears were more than just sentimental: They sent a powerful message to the country, and especially to its boys, that real men ought to feel comfortable showing emotion in public, that crying can be a way of communicating strength, not weakness. \nTonight at the SAG Awards , Mahershala Ali, visibly emotional, made much the same statement when he took the stage to accept a very well-deserved supporting actor award for his role in Moonlight —in which, appropriately, he plays a man who provides a fatherless, persecuted gay kid with a gentler, kinder, more open model of masculinity. \n“What I learned from working on Moonlight is that we see what happens when you persecute people,” Ali said, his voice low and his eyes wet. “They fold into themselves, and what I was so grateful about in having the opportunity to play Juan was playing a gentleman who saw a young man folding into himself as the result of the persecution of his community and taking the opportunity to tell him that he mattered, that he was okay, and to accept him. And I hope that we do a better job at that.” \nIn a night dominated by political protest speeches —a night when actual protests are raging all around the country—Ali offered a tearful reminder that the personal is political. “My mother is an ordained minister,” he said. “I’m a Muslim. She didn’t do back flips when I called her to tell her I converted 17 years ago. But I’ll tell you now, we put things to the side. I was able to see her. She was able to see me. We love each other. The love has grown.” \nNow is a moment when so many of us feel like crying, and we have a president who might call us losers for doing so. What perfect timing for another reminder: Real men aren’t afraid to cry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T05:42:49.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
