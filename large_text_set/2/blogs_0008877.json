File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble (P&G) has inked an agreement with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to pilot a micro-entrepreneur development program that will equip “sari-sari” store owners with fundamental entrepreneurial knowledge and business seed capital. \nCalled “Angat Kita,” the program aims to help interested sari-sari store entrepreneurs to realize their full potential to generate income, sustain livelihood, and eventually uplift their current status. \nP&G said participants need to attend a series of training workshops developed by the company’s retail experts before gaining access to seed capital to put to practice what they learned. \nThrough its wide distribution network, P&G said it hopes to introduce the Angat Kita program to thousands of micro-entrepreneurs and have them enroll at the DTI Negosyo Centers nationwide. \nThe pilot program is targeted to be rolled out in Mandaluyong City and four other locations within the next few months. \n“P&G has a unique capability to contribute specifically in the area of leadership development. As a humble enterprise that started small and grew to one of the leading and lasting FMCGs (fast moving consumer goods) globally, we take seriously our social responsibility to cultivate the next generation of successful entrepreneurs,” P&G Asia-Pacific president Magesvaran Suranja said.
