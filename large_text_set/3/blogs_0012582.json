Police say the teen then body slammed the officer to the ground, causing him to hit his head. \nEmployees at the Philly Pretzel Factory say police found the teenager hiding in the alley behind their store. \nJohn Gallante says,”Thank God the back door was locked. We didn’t hear anything unusual. We were good. He was right there.” \nPolice say the teen also fits the description of a suspect who robbed a 7-Eleven at gunpoint early Sunday morning. \nChief Inspector Scott Small says, “Not only is this individual going to be charged with assault on police, but Northeast is looking in to the possibility he may have committed this robbery at point of gun.” \nSmall adds, “He has braces on his teeth. That’s the individual we have in custody today and that is also the description of the individual who committed the robbery point of gun, at the 7-Eleven.” \nPolice and K9s are now combing the area looking for the weapon.
