Tips for Using an Air Fryer Shake it . \nBe sure to open the air fryer and shake foods around as they “fry” in the machine’s basket—smaller foods like French fries and chips can compress. For best results, rotate them every 5-10 minutes. Don’t overcrowd . \nGive foods plenty of space so that the air can circulate effectively; that’s what gives you crispy results. Our test kitchen cooks swear by the air fryer for snacks and small batches. Give foods a spray . \nLightly spray foods with cooking spray or add just a bit of oil to ensure they don’t stick to the basket. Keep it dry . \nPat foods dry before cooking (if they are marinated, for example) to avoid splattering and excess smoke. Similarly, when cooking high-fat foods like chicken wings, make sure to empty the fat from the bottom machine periodically. Master other cooking methods . \nThe air fryer isn’t just for frying; it’s great for other healthy cooking methods like baking, roasting and grilling, too. Our test kitchen also loves to use the machine for cooking salmon! \nAir Fryer Recipes \nTry these savory appetizers and snacks.
