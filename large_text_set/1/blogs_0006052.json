We were not editing life. Stephen Skinner, 32, with his wife Holly (Photo: Channel Mum) \n\"We had planned to put a tripod in the corner of the room and film the water birth. I was going to get in the pool with Holly. \n\"So when we found out that she was going to have a c-section there was a big part of us that thought, 'This isn't going to work now.' \n\"We thought, 'People aren't going to want to watch it,' but in the end it was probably better because it was such an emotional, real thing.

Put the camera away and focus on it.' \n\"But Holly and I are both really happy that we did manage to capture the down moments as well as the high, elated moments. \n\"It was very very difficult as some points but the birth was one of the most beautiful things both of us have experienced.\" Stephen gets ready for action with Holly just about to give birth (Photo: Channel Mum) But it was all worth it as little Atlas as born after an emergency C-section (Photo: Channel Mum) \nStephen added: \"By doing this I was trying to bring some attention to dads and say, 'Hey, us guys work hard too. \n\"We are caring and supportive and we cry as well.'\" \nHolly said: \"There were times when I felt like I didn't really want the camera there but I'm so glad that we have got it to look back on.

I've had so many people contacting me to say, 'I wish we'd done that.' \n\"I've watched the videos a million times and I cry every single time. \n\"It is so amazing that we will have them to keep forever, and I will get to show Atlas one day.\" Holly with her newborn child after the operation (Photo: Channel Mum) \nThe couple added that they hope that sharing their experience will help remove the \"taboo\" surrounding C-sections. \nHolly said: \"The C-section was not what I wanted and when I found out I cried a lot. \n\"I was so hooked on this idea of what it should have been, but it was so so much more than I could have asked for. \n\"In the end it was never up to me.
