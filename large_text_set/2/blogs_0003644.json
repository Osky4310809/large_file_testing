While all eyes will be on the gridiron, there will be plenty of moments for fans who enjoy another sort of spectacle: politician-watching. \nThe big game is set to provide a good dose of excitement for non-sports fans. So for those who want to keep score that way, here's a guide of whom to look out for: \nPoliticians \nVice President Mike Pence — with his bevy of Secret Service — is expected to have a seat at NRG Stadium, NBC News has learned.

Mark Wilson / Getty Images \nHe will be the fourth vice president to attend the Super Bowl, following former vice presidents Spiro Agnew, George H.W. Bush and Al Gore, who made special appearances during their stints in office. \nRelated: Super Bowl Ads Walk Delicate Balance in Donald Trump Era \nFormer President George H.W. Bush and first lady Barbara Bush will also be at the game Sunday to play an important role: the coin toss. \nBush, who was discharged from the hospital earlier last week, will oversee the toss for the second time in his life with his wife to signal the start of the game. He became the first president to toss the coin at the Super Bowl in 2002(his son, George W. Bush, was commander in chief at the time).

The pop singer has been giving fans video teasers in recent days about what songs she could end up performing. \nWhile the outspoken artist has been vocal about LGBTQ rights, she hasn't indicated whether she will make any political statements during her performance.
