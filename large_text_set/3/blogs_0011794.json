Instead, the big coastal cities came out of Tuesday’s storm with relatively little impact, while many points inland are still buried.There was no second-guessing the intensity of the fast-hitting storm, dubbed Stella by The Weather Channel. Surface pressures dropped at incredible rates downstream of the surface low (see Figure 2 below), on par with pressure drops observed with some hurricanes. The quick intensification led to very strong winds, especially along the New England coast. On Cape Cod, Wellfleet, MA, gusted to 79 mph , and widespread gusts to 50-70 mph knocked out power to more than 50,000 customers in northeast Massachusetts. At the storm crescendoed around 6:00 pm EST Tuesday, Boston’s Logan International Airport was enduring northeast winds of 46 mph gusting to 56 mph, with mixed rain and snow and a temperature of 37°F.

The NY State Mesonet station at Southold, on the north fork of Long Island, experienced a pressure drop of more than 50 millibars (maroon line on right side of image) in less than 36 hours, with pressures dropping at a rate of roughly 15 mb per 3 hours as Stella approached on Tuesday afternoon, March 14, 2017.

The intense surface low associated with Winter Storm Stella (979 mb) was located at the eastern tip of Long Island at 2100Z (4:00 pm EDT) Tuesday, March 14. Two-hour pressure falls (blue dashed lines) were analyzed at greater than 9 mb near the coast of Maine ahead of Stella. Image credit: NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center . Putting the semi-bust into context Meteorologists were frequent interviewees on Tuesday, explaining why a small shift inland of the rain/snow transition zone had such big consequences on the outcome from Washington to Boston. Probabilistic graphics issued by several   offices had amply highlighted the large uncertainties. In some cases, when it became more apparent a given spot would be located very near the transition zone, the probabilistic uncertainties actually grew. One such graphic on Monday night showed that there was a 10% chance that New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport would receive 1” or less, and a 10% chance that it would get 21” or more! Overall, the snowfall amounts in the major East Coast cities came in on the low side of the probabilistic ranges, though in some cases they were below the “expect at least this much” (the lowest 10% range).The main complication was a slice of warm air several thousand feet thick that was pulled onshore northeast of the fast-strengthening low a bit more strongly than expected. This meant a changeover from snow to a messy mix of sleet, freezing rain, and snow in some of the most heavily populated areas—very unpleasant, but not truly crippling. Cliff Mass, a professor at the University of Washington, labeled the event “Slushmaggeddon.” He noted that with this storm, heavy precipitation occurred just as expected, even in the big cities, but the form of that precipitation was different than many had expected. In other storms, the big uncertainty isn’t with the type of precipitation but the amounts: the edge of heavy snow can shift just outside of an urban area, leaving the city with much less than expected, as occurred in New York City in January 2015 . “Both were difficult forecasts with a large gradient of snow,” said Mass in an email.Snow and sleet totals along the I-95 corridor included: 2.0” Washington (Reagan National)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T08:26:16.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
