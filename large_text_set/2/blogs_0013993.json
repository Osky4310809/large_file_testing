Now it appears that Tata Group and Reliance Communications have initiated talks to explore a possible union as well to take on Reliance Jio. \nAccording to The Economic Times , Tata Group’s Tata Teleservices is planning to join forces with the merged RCom-Aircel and MTS. If the deal goes through, the move could create the third-largest telecom operator in the country behind the proposed Vodafone-Idea merger and Bharti Airtel. \nAs per the report, Tata Teleservices’ debt of around Rs 30,000 crore will be a big factor in any talks with the RCom-Aircel merger, which has a debt of a similar amount. The report goes on to say that Tata Sons is looking to infuse Rs 10,000 crore to clear Tata Teleservices’ balance sheet. \nIf Tata Teleservices merges with RCom-Aircel and MTS, they will have approximately 260 million combined users. The merged entity will grab around 18 percent revenue market share and total spectrum of 1,274MHz. As of now, Airtel leads the market with 266 million users as per regulatory data until December 31st. Vodafone and Idea Cellular have 205 million and 190 million users respectively. Reliance Jio on the other hand recently crossed 100 million users, but it remains to be seen how many users it retains after its free data offer expires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:16:17.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
