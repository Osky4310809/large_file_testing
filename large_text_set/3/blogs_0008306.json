LinkedIn Workforce Report: January and February were the strongest consecutive months for hiring since August and September 2015 \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 8, 2017 Advertisement - story continues below Radio Host Buck Sexton Identifies Reasons Behind The Left’s Opposition To Trump’s Immigration Ban \nA new report from ADP Research Institute shows that the private sector added 298,000 new jobs in February, more than 100,000 jobs above projections. \nThe February report comes after strong January numbers. American companies added 261,000 positions in January, a number recently revised from initial estimates of 246,000. \n“February proved to be an incredibly strong month for employment with increases we have not seen in years,” Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of ADP said in a statement.

They are hiring more aggressively.” Advertisement - story continues below", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T23:18:07.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
