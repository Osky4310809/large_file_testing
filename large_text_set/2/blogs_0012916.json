Feb 17 What We Need to Say To Beat The Republican President I’ve been watching how effective the Republicans are at framing the debate and shifting the conversation. NY Times breaks a story, Republicans yell, “Fake News,” and then we’re arguing over it’s fake or not Evidence shows that even when we are negating their position we’re bolstering it by legitimizing it. Instead, we need to stick to our own game plan Thus, I’m suggesting the left (starting with us) can bring down this administration by focusing on one storyline: We, the American people, demand that our elected officials determine what lies, corruption, and illegal actions have been perpetrated by this administration The hard part is that to accomplish this, we’ll need to focus less on the myriad other things this administration is attacking and instead remain focused on our own attack on the President’s credibility. To help this, I’m offering sound bites to be used. Repeatedly. As often as possible. Dodge/Dodgy Not being honest with the American people What are you hiding? Have the Russians infiltrated the Republican administration? Americans have a right to know Show us your taxes Impeach So, for example, when the President does something crazy like asking whether all Black people know each other, or calling the NY Times “fake news” or says he’s the least anti-Semitic person you’ll ever meet, we say: “This is another dodge from our dodgy Republican President. What are you hiding, Mr. President? #impeach ” or “When @realdonaldtrump tweets ‘Fake News,’ he’s just trying to dodge the real question — have the Russians infiltrated the Trump administration? Americans have a right to know. #showusyourtaxes ” Where do we use these? On Twitter, when calling your elected officials, in letters to the editor, or if you’re Jake Tapper or just lucky enough to be in front of a camera, use them on air. I’m sick of us playing defense to this insane man and his corrupt staff. This is how we go on the offense. You with me? P.S. One word left off this recommendation intentionally is the President’s name. He loves to see it. Better to remind him that he’s part of the party, and better to remind the party that he’s theirs to deal with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:13:43.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
