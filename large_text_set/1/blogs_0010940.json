Jonathan Blyth, the group’s spokesman, told FoxNews.com on Wednesday. “We’ve been preparing for this since the last inauguration. We’re focused to protecting and honoring a new commander in chief.” \n\nSeveral anti-Trump groups are expected to host demonstrations on January 20th, including DisruptJ20 and RefuseFacism.org, with stated intentions to disrupt the inarguable ceremonies from the parade to the ball by using, among other tactics, human blockades to stop traffic, public transit and parties. \nSeveral protest groups planning large-scale demonstrations have permits in place and have already held organizational meetings, among them the collaborative DisruptJ20. \n\n“We’re planning a series of massive, direct actions that will shut down the inauguration ceremonies and any related celebrations,” the group says. “We’re also planning to paralyze the city.” \n\nOrganizers say they are targeting everything from the parade to the balls and plan to use blockades and protesters to stop traffic, public transit and parties. \n\nThe group RefuseFacism.org is planning a small-scale protest Saturday in the city’s McPherson Square, just blocks from the White House, that organizers hope will grow into larger inauguration-weekend protests. \n\nThe group burned U.S. flags this summer at the Democratic and Republican national conventions and this week tried to disrupt the Senate confirmation hearing for Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions to become Trump’s attorney general. \n\n“I wouldn’t want to meet with [Trump], but I would say to him, ‘You’re a fascist. Your regime is illegitimate.’ And it must not be allowed to take power,” the group’s Carl Dix told Fox on Wednesday on Capitol Hill. Dix acknowledged the group doesn’t have a federal or city permit to protest but still intends to “stop the regime.” \nOf course, the one pro-Trump organization that has registered for a demonstration permit is the now infamous \"Bikers for Trump\" group. And while we're sure they're only interested in peacefully supporting their candidate, we would highly recommend that the disaffected Hillary snowflakes stay far away from their reserved demonstration area. \n\nMeanwhile, the protesting madness is expected to continue the day after inauguration with 200,000 women expected to join the Women’s March on Washington. The event is expected to draw the typical Hollywood crowd, including Amy Schumer, who was supposed to have left the country by now , and Scarlett Johansson. \nWe wish all the protesters the best of luck, we're sure your efforts will truly make a positive difference in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:50:48.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
