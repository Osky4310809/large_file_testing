Reuters 6 Mourinho appears frustrated with his reputation for defensive football \nEight months into his reign at Manchester United it is becoming increasingly clear Mourinho is desperate to be loved and be seen as an entertainer. \nIt is obviously too late for United to challenge for the title. Yet the Portuguese’s team is slowly transforming to one which has a strong identity and is decent to watch. \nAnd that is why Mourinho is getting frustrated. Antonio Conte , Mauricio Pochettino and Jurgen Klopp get credit for developing exciting, attacking teams — even if their sides contain a few flaws. \nBut not Mourinho or United. \nAfter a thoroughly impressive win over Watford , the Old Trafford chief said: “I think it was the kind of football that if, instead of being Mourinho’s team, if it is somebody else’s team, you would say ‘art’. But because it is my team you just say is very good, but that’s fine. It was very good.” PA:Press Association The Special One suggests a manager like Jurgen Klopp would receive more credit for producing a similar brand of football to his United team PA:Press Association Mourinho lifts the 2015 Premier League title with Chelsea Getty Images 6 Juan Mata was frozen out under the Portuguese boss at Stamford Bridge \nMourinho was then asked if he should have had more credit for some of his previous teams — particularly Chelsea’s title- winning side in 2015. \nHe added: “That was the past and is not a problem for me as I have the trophies at home. \n“It is more important to have the trophies rather than the praise. Manchester United 2-0 Watford : United move one point behind City in fourth \n“What I think you are forgetting this season is this is the most defensive Premier League I have ever known. It is not because of my team.” \nMore goals like Juan Mata’s 32nd-minute opener would help Mourinho’s cause. The Spaniard started the move with a flick, Anthony Martial crossed, Zlatan Ibrahimovic dummied and Mata swept the ball past keeper Heurelho Gomes. \nMartial’s second goal on the hour was also excellent with Ander Herrera and Ibrahomivic combining well. PA:Press Association But the Spaniard has been Mourinho's go-to guy at Old Trafford Reuters 6 Anthony Martial also fought his way back into the fold with a goal against Watford \nMourinho added: “When I came here people thought Mata was in trouble but I knew he wouldn’t be in trouble. \n“One thing was the football I wanted my Chelsea to play and the other thing was the football I wanted my Manchester United to play. \n“Mata has adapted to the football I want to play. I knew since the beginning he would be an important player and I think he feels that confidence in me. \n“So he is happy and you can see it in the way he plays.” \nUnited face a three-week wait for their next Premier League game — against Bournemouth on March 4. 10 things you didn't know about Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho Related Stories Antonio Conte issues response to Jose Mourinho's 'jokey play' mind games after latest jibes Art attack Jose Mourinho believes pundits would say Man United's football was like 'art' if someone else was in charge MR FLEXIBLE Henrikh Mkhitaryan could find himself at left-back again... as Jose says he will continue to use him all over Real Good Mates Man Utd boss Jose Mourinho confident Real Madrid won't play dirty if they try to sign David De Gea MARTIAL LAW LAID DOWN Mourinho has lost faith in £36m flop Anthony Martial and will hand left-wing slot to Marcus Rashford YES WAY JOSE Why Marouane Fellaini isn't surprised that Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho is nice about him re-united Jose Mourinho is bringing Spain to David De Gea to keep him at Man United and away from Real Madrid Jose Mourinho makes epic rally cry to all sports fans in cool Heineken advert \nThey have two legs of their Europa League tie against St Etienne, Sunday’s FA Cup fifth-round trip to Blackburn and the EFL Cup final against Southampton on February 26. \nMourinho said: “We know Southampton are probably going to have some days off. \n“I don’t know if they are going to some nice, beautiful place with nice weather to prepare for the final. \n“The only thing I know is their next game is the final and we have to play three matches during this period. \n“We have to train in this cold weather on bad pitches. \n“So our situation is not easy.
