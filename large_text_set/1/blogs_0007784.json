Thank you for being a friend. pic.twitter.com/vP7kAr0Eum \n— hulu (@hulu) January 7, 2017 \nIt’s time for a whole new generation to understand the power of The Golden Girls . The hit TV show about four older women who had very different personalities but still forged enduring friendships will be coming to Hulu on February 13th, 2017. That’s right: Galentine’s Day, otherwise known as the best day of the year !\nNow you can celebrate Galentine’s Day in style with Dorothy, Rose, Blanche and Sophia, the core four who are the best friends that you didn’t know you needed. Since this TV show originally aired back in the late 80s and early 90s, I’m sure our younger TMS readers never had the chance to watch it, although they’ve probably grown up seeing gifs of it online and hearing references to the show.\nHulu has given us all a chance to rewatch this classic ode to female friendship… not to mention that it’s a show about older women, which shouldn’t be a rarity, but sadly it is even now. If you’re watching it for the first time, I would say: be patient. The show starts out a bit slow, as many sitcoms did back in the 80s, and the characters change a bit before growing into the women we all know and love. There’s a gazillion episodes, so this is definitely one of those “leave it on in the background while doing chores” types of shows. Perfect for a lazy February in 2017!\n(via Engadget )\nWant more stories like this?
