It’s way harder for us if it’s working.'” Vogt-Robert tells CS. “I said, ‘I don’t care. I want the camera working and I want film in the camera at all times.’ If she’s taking a photo, she’s actually taking a photo. I told Brie about that idea and she really ran with it. She’s a photographer and a director herself.” \nKong: Skull Island tells the story of a diverse team of scientists, soldiers and adventurers uniting to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific, as dangerous as it is beautiful. Cut off from everything they know, the team ventures into the domain of the mighty Kong, igniting the ultimate battle between man and nature. As their mission of discovery becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape a primal Eden in which humanity does not belong. \nKong: Skull Island stars Tom Hiddleston , Brie Larson , Samuel L. Jackson John Goodman, Jing Tian, Toby Kebbell, John Ortiz, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann, Terry Notary and John C. Reilly. \nKong: Skull Island is scripted by John Gatins and Max Borenstein.
