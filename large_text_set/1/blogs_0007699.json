This is hardly surprising considering Rodriquez is a red carpet regular who knows how to hold her own on the scene.\nBut really, her ability to pull off this vintage-inspired, floor-length, shimmery, white-tailed dress (so many things all at once, and so much perfection) further proves that while Rodriquez somehow pulls off being relatable in her interviews, she’s a force to be reckoned with on the red carpet.\nNow we want to know if she can also dance like a flapper girl, because that would elevate this look to a whole different level. Today is a great day, I can and I will. 3rd nomination, 4th season renewal and family, friends, cast, and supporters that have all helped me get here.

This IS show business.\nWe’re eager to see how the awards show treats Rodriquez, and whether her nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series (musical or comedy) from her role in Jane The Virgin lands her a globe for her trophy shelf!\nWe’re rooting for you Rodriquez, and if you don’t take an award home tonight, you would kill it in a backup career as a modern flapper.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T03:12:04.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
