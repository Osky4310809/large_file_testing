In Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation the actor hung from the side of a plane as it took off, while in the previous installment, Ghost Protocol , Cruise climbed the exterior of the world's tallest building in Dubai. \nSo what in the world could Cruise be planning next? \nSpeaking to producer David Ellison, who worked on the last two Mission:Impossible movies, at SXSW, Collider reports that whatever the stunt is, Cruise has been training for an entire year in order to pull it off. He's been training since completing Rogue Nation -- that's how far he's going now. \n\"I will say after the Burj [Khalifa] we thought it was going to be impossible to top that stunt, and then Tom did the A380 for the plane,\" Ellison said. \"What Tom is doing in this movie I believe will top anything that’s come before. It is absolutely unbelievable—he’s been training for a year. It is going to be, I believe, the most impressive and unbelievable thing that Tom Cruise has done in a movie, and he has been working on it since right after Rogue Nation came out. It’s gonna be mind-blowing.” \nCruise will join Rebecca Ferguson (returning from Rogue Nation ), as well as a newcomer to the series, Henry Cavill. The sixth installment, written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, hits theaters on July 27, 2018. Like it?
