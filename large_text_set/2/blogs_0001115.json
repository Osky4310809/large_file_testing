The latest to catch parents’ attention (and worry them as a result) is the “salt and ice” challenge . Apparently, it’s a game in which teens rub salt and ice on their arms or their hands to simulate the kinds of burns you would get from frostbite.\nWe don’t know why exactly kids would want to participate in any sort of challenge like this, but it’s been picking up popularity all over social media. Individuals are posting pictures of the swollen, red cuts and burns on their body, using the hashtag #saltandicechallenge to share their experiences. There are even videos floating around YouTube, which have been around since 2012. Some have been watched 6.5 million times.\nParents, guardians, teachers...there is a new social media craze called the \"salt and ice challenge\" which causes a reaction similar to frostbite and can leave a child with serious burns (pictured). Please be vigilant - let's prevent more children getting hurt. #warning #burns #socialmediacraze #saltandicechallenge #teachers #parents #schools #facebook \nA photo posted by Changing Faces (@changingfacesuk) on Jan 26, 2017 at 2:42am PST \nThe NSPCC has been sending out messages of caution in an attempt to protect kids from inadvertently hurting themselves with this game, especially considering the fact that a mother had to bring her son to the hospital in the U.K. due to nerve damage caused by the game. They’re trying to warn parents about the dangers of the salt and ice challenge in order to prevent any future injuries.\nThese kinds of games kids play may sound innocent, but they can have deadly consequences. Take the Chubby Bunny challenge , for example, in which individuals stuff their face with as many marshmallows as possible and say the phrase, “Chubby Bunny.” A sixth grader actually choked and died from playing it with her friends at school, and her parents sued the school district for not better supervising the students. They were awarded $2 million in damages .\nThe after affects of the #saltandicechallenge \nA photo posted by Chase Guns170VLOGS (@chase_guns170vlogs) on Jun 3, 2016 at 9:54am PDT \nLol salt and ice challenge #saltandicechallenge \nA photo posted by Samuel William Markham (@samuel_w_markham) on Jan 16, 2017 at 5:26pm PST \nHopefully, the NSPCC will get the message across to all the parents and prevent any serious damage from happening to any kids.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:00:10.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
