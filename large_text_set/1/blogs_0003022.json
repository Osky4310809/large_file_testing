There, floating about in a mystic fashion is a straggly egg white, haunting your breakfast, mocking your toast. \nYou'd likely be forgiven for suggesting that poached eggs simply aren't worth the effort. But done properly, they're delicious – soft white treasure chests full of liquid gold. \nMuch like scrambled eggs, there are a few points to consider if you're in it to win it. You might be thinking of the Vinegar Trick? Well, it turns out that the method is somewhat divisive in the chef world. Vinegar isn't a universal rule Eggy pockets of delight (Photo: Getty) \nWe'll come back to the vinegar, because there's one thing that's absolutely crucial and agreed upon if you're to make perfect poached eggs: age. Namely, the age of the eggs. You need the freshest possible. It might sound obvious, but then it's not an imperative of fried, boiled, indeed any other (though advisable). \nHead chef of Native in London's Covent Garden and former River Cottage man Ivan Tisdall-Downes told Mirror Online : \"First things first - a fresh egg! Ideally free range, they have the richest yolks and hold their shape so there's no need for a ramekin, vinegar, or whisking the water!\" \nNo vinegar at all? No vigorous whisking? No ramekin from which to delicately slip the egg into the simmering water below? \"Not if you use the freshest eggs,\" Ivan added. \"With a super fresh egg the inner membrane is strong, which will keep the albumin in tact around the egg yolk. \"It's when the egg ages that the inner membrane begins to break down, releasing more of the albumin during cooking - in this case you will need vinegar to help set the egg. \"I drop them into boiling water but then remove the pan from the heat, as the water is still and not bubbling it prevents the eggs from feathering.\" Put an egg on it Eggs Benedict calls for perfect poached eggs (Photo: Getty) Ivan's eggs are good. I've had them. However, others swear by the use of vinegar. The Guardian's recipe expert Felicity Cloake mentions it as a reasonable option, as does food writer Leah Hyslop from Sainsbury's Magazine . Leah told me: \"Vinegar definitely helps - adding acid to the water helps the white of the egg set quicker, so you don't get those nasty straggly bits! \"I personally don't think there's any need to use a ramekin or cling film - you just need to get the water swirling quite fast, then gently slip the egg in. \"Don't try and do more than one egg at a time would be my top tip - they often end up sticking together, or don't cook quickly enough. \n\"Also, always lift out with a slotted spoon and let rest a little on kitchen paper. Stops it being soggy and watery.\" These look like fine poached eggs (unfortunately they're sitting on avocado) https://www.instagram.com/p/BOxCcYHBJ7R/embed Chef and writer Sophie Michell agrees on the vinegar. And also makes a point of limiting the number of eggs cooking at one time. She said: \"When it comes to poaching eggs, keep it simple. Add a good bit of white wine vinegar to a large body of water, then add the eggs just when the small bubbles are starting to appear. \"I don't add too many to the pan and I don't do it when the bubbles are too big.\" Sophie also mentions the fact that eggs must be fresh (though still believes in the use of vinegar). \"One major tip is that you must use very fresh eggs as the white is tighter and won't spread out too much,\" she said. Water temperature is also an important aspect of poached egg cookery – add your egg too early, before the water has had a chance to calm down, and your egg will be all flustered. You will conjure the egg ghost. poll loading Do you add vinegar to your poached eggs? 0+ VOTES SO FAR No, but I'm going to try it No, I don't think it's necessary Absolutely! It really works I don't like poached eggs Most people also seem to believe that whisking the water (with a balloon whisk, preferably, as Felicity Cloake also notes) is key. Marcus Wareing , once a champion of breakfasts at the famous Savoy hotel, advises whirling up the water before easing the egg in carefully, so that it travels as one inside the hot flow of the water. But then Delia Smith calls the whirlpool practice \"French\" and instead relies on time – she allows her eggs to cook slowly in hot, shallow water. About ten minutes. Some people don't even need ramekins to aid a gentle touch. \n“In the end, we found that that doing virtually nothing works best,\" food writers the Gastro Gays told me. \n\"We use a gas cooker, so regulating the water temperature is easy - just below boiling point. \n\"Leave the egg in the water for three minutes exactly, and it’s good to go!\" \nThe one clear rule for poached eggs, then? Freshness. Everything else is up to you. Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T20:02:18.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
