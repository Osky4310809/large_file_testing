Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIn this week's Sporting Life column, Charlie Nicholas is tipping Wolves to upset the odds again and trouble Premier League leaders Chelsea. \n- - - - - - - - - - \nThere are some really interesting potential upsets around in the FA Cup this weekend and I do fancy Tottenham to be pushed hard on Sunday by Fulham. \nMy fellow Soccer Saturday panellists Paul Merson and Matt Le Tissier have been down at Sutton 'helping' them train. The two of them were apparently there to give them some tips but that's just made me more confident Arsenal won't have any trouble on Monday night. Charlie Nicholas believes Wolves could spring a surprise against Chelsea \nNot many will be opposing Chelsea in Saturday's late kick-off but I think Wolves could earn a replay at least. \nIt's surprising that they have dipped in form since dumping out Liverpool because Paul Lambert isn't one for pats on the backs.

David Luiz looks like he's picked up a couple of little injuries so he will likely rest him as well. \nThey've obviously got Cesc Fabregas to come in but his other options aren't quite as strong and Eden Hazard hasn't kicked a ball in the competition so far, so it will be interesting to see whether he plays. Paul Lambert will be hoping to mastermind another upset (Photo: Getty) \nWolves will look to get fiery with Chelsea, which is just what they don't need right now and I've got to stick with them after they came up trumps at 28/1 for me in the previous round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:40:19.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
