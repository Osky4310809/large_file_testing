On the Monday, February 6, episode of Teen Mom 2 , some of the moms were having problems with their exes. For Kailyn Lowry , it was difficult to coparent with Javi Marroquin when she didn’t want to see him at all, but for Chelsea Houska , it was difficult to co-parent when Adam Lind skipped milestones like, you know, their daughter’s first day of first grade.

She knew the school year would be “hectic” because the schools would be brimming with kids displaced by recent flooding, so she wanted them to have a great time.

Even though Ali wasn’t having trouble maneuvering around their resort, Leah was stressing while trying to relax at a restaurant over how to let Ali keep feeling independent, and how to handle any health deterioration that might come their way. \nThe young mother of three started to cry. “Whatever happens is going to happen, and I’m going to be her mommy no matter what,” she said as she dabbed her eyes. \nKailyn’s Exes Coparent Without Her \nSince Kailyn wasn’t interested in interacting with her ex Javi, her other ex Jo Rivera had to step in. After all, his son with Kailyn, Isaac, still wanted to hang out with Javi, regardless of the fact that Kailyn was icing Javi out. Essentially, Javi and Jo were co-parenting. No, we aren’t kidding. Kailyn’s exes actually took the kids to get ice cream together because she couldn’t be bothered to see Javi. See, Javi, too, was worried about Isaac. He fumed to a friend that Kailyn didn’t even care that her son was so torn up about losing his secondary father figure. For her part, Kailyn wasn’t really featured in this episode, just like last week. Chelsea Houska, Janelle Evans, Kailyn Lowry, Leah Meser Drew Reynolds \nChelsea’s Ex Has a Point to Prove \nOn the first day of daughter Aubree’s first grade class, Chelsea Houska was overjoyed, and she kept that momentum going when she went to cheer the 7-year-old on at a T-ball game a few nights later. \nShe was a little angry that Aubree’s dad, Adam Lind , showed up to the game, which was filmed, but didn’t bother showing up to the little girl’s first day of school, which was not. After how mad he got at producers last week for supposedly making him look bad that time he drove his car away from their scheduled filming, his sudden, recorded interest in being Dad of the Year doesn’t quite surprise Us. \nIn case you were suddenly Team Adam, MTV did use the “Previously on Teen Mom 2 …” segment at the top of the episode to remind viewers that he is way behind on child support payments.
