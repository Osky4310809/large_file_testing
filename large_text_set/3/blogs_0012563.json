He has denied the charges. \nThe Catholic Church in Rwanda last year offered an apology, saying some of its members had fanned the ethnic hatred that led to the killings, but Kagame said at the time that he wanted the pope himself to say sorry. \n“Why doesn’t he apologise like he does with other cases where more minor crimes were committed by comparison with here?,” he said, referring to sexual abuse cases where the pope has regularly apologised to victims and their families. \nFrancis said on Monday he hoped his “humble recognition of the failings of that period, which, unfortunately, disfigured the face of the Church, may contribute to a ‘purification of memory’ and may promote, in hope and renewed trust, a future of peace”. \n(REUTERS)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:01:35.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
