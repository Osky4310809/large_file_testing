The suspect, Olayiwola Animashaun, was arrested by a police team attached to the Area C Command in the Shitta area of Surulere. PUNCH Metro learnt that Animashaun usually operated under Surulere bridge, Tejuosho, Ojuelegba and around National Stadium, where he reportedly extorted money from unsuspecting motorists and other members of the public. It was gathered that he wanted to resume his illegal operation under the bridge at about 2pm on Thursday when the operatives stormed the area. He was said to have fled on sighting them, but was eventually tracked down. A police source disclosed to our correspondent that he led the team to his house, where a traffic task force reflective jacket, police statement forms, and a machete were recovered. “The impersonator parades himself as a policeman to unsuspecting members of the public in the Surulere area. He has been terrorising people for years and extorting money and other valuables from unsuspecting members of the public,” the source said. The Police Public Relations Officer in Lagos State, ASP Olarinde Famous-Cole, confirmed Animashaun’s arrest, saying that the suspect had confessed to the crime. The PPRO said a walkie-talkie, a Lagos State Ministry of Transportation identity card bearing the suspect’s name, and passport photograph were found on Animashaun. He said, “It was alleged that the suspect has over the years been parading himself as a policeman and extorting valuables from unsuspecting members of the public. He was intercepted under the bridge of Surulere near the stadium, where he was about to resume his criminal activities. “He confessed to have once worked with the Lagos State Government. His areas of operation are mostly around Tejuosho, Ojuelegba and National stadium. “Members of the public are advised to be wary of individuals who present themselves as government officials or police officers with no official identification. They should question or alert other security agencies when the need arises. The suspected impersonator will be charged to court after investigation is completed.” Copyright PUNCH.
