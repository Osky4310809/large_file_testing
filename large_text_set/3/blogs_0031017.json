As brilliantly reconceived by Marber, the Don who gets his end away endlessly becomes one of this playwright's personal pantheon of men who have used themselves up and are now running on empty – dangerously funny, frantic and, in their own way, fearless. \nTennant's Don is so lounging, rangy, keeling over with a cleverness that seeks to outsmart any attempt to pin him down as potentially the prime victim of all his diabolically involuted ironies and pranks. He lives to have sex because everything else is a busted flush – and he's not fussy about orifices either. “He'd do it with anything – a hole in the ozone layer,” reports his chubby little factotum Stan (excellent Adrian Scarborough) with whom he shares a condescendingly chummy spliff but nothing by way of wages. This Don is in the great tradition of supposing his sexual indulgence is a cudgel against hypocrisy and Marber gets a dig in at the 45th President: “I'm not a rapist – I don't grab pussy”. But what comes across with a blast of rancid air here is that the numerous women he tups his way through are like so many pages torn from a calendar by the denizen of a condemned cell.
