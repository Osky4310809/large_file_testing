And if you have been led to believe that fashion is not your thing, think again! Here is a quick guide to help short women make the right choice. The secret of styling your body type is to make your body look longer and avoid styles that widen your frame. So, stop fretting and read on. \n1. Pick the right neckline. One of the basic things is to pick a neckline that elongate your frame. So, v-necks and scoop necks, deep round necks and sweetheart necklines are the best choices to flatter your figure. \nOur picks \n2. Find your print story. Who doesn’t love prints? But as a petite girl, you should steer clear of large and bold prints as these can overwhelm your frame. Go for prints that are not larger than your fist size, and you will save yourself from making a fashion disaster. Also, go for elongated prints like paisleys as they make you look taller. \nOur picks \n3. Vertical stripes are your best friends. If you love stripes, it’s best to go with vertical stripes instead of horizontal ones. While vertical stripes create an illusion of height, horizontal stripes draw attention to the width of your frame, making you look shorter. \nOur picks \nYou Might Also Like: How To Pick The Perfect Palazzo Pants For Your Body Type \n4. Say no to ill-fitting outfits. This one is a no-brainer! While ill-fitting clothes are a no-no for everyone, the rule applies the most to you as loose fabrics will hide your frame completely. In case, you absolutely love a loose fit, try defining your frame with a sleek belt. \nOur picks \n5. Go for A-line and high-waisted outfits. A-line silhouettes are flattering for every woman, but they are the safest bet to define your frame. High-waisted palazzos or skirts make your legs look longer, thus making you look taller. When paired with a top tucked in, it makes you look classy and chic like never before. \nOur picks \n6. Monochrome magic \nStick to monochrome outfits as they elongate your frame by creating a vertical line and look super chic. Keep it simple or add a bit of drama to your look with separates like dupattas , stoles or ethnic jackets. \nOur picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:02:13.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
