Anything can happen and things change very quickly but I am happy at Manchester United. \n\"Of course, as I have said before, I want to play more games. \n\"I am in a happy place, a good moment personally, so I think I have a year, with an option [of a] year to go. We will see what happens and what happens after that.\" \nDiego Costa sends a message \nRooney, who was subject to a bid from Beijing Guoan before the start of the season, has made 16 Premier League appearances this season, with half of those as a starter. He has scored two goals in the league and five in all competitions.
