In Europe, eagles are being trained to intercept potential terrorist drones .\nPhoto Aisholpan, left, and her father, Nurgaiv, in a scene from “The Eagle Huntress,” a documentary generating Oscar buzz. Credit Asher Svidensky/Sony Pictures Classics And “The Eagle Huntress,” a film about a 13-year-old Kazakh girl living in Mongolia and trying to break into the male-dominated sport, could contend for best documentary at the Oscars.\nThe practice’s exact origins are unclear, but it may have originated thousands of years ago in the steppes near the Silk Road. It spread to the early empires of China, India, Persia, Egypt and Europe.\nBesides falcons and eagles, falconers have used raptors like hawks, kites and even owls.\nMarco Polo said Kublai Khan had thousands of falconers. Charlemagne believed that real gentlemen should be trained in falconry. And Henry VIII built fancy mews, or hawk cages, in Trafalgar Square in London.\nEven if you’ve never participated in the sport, you may have used terminology related to it.\n“Fed up,” “hoodwinked,” and “bated breath” are some examples in English. And birds that drink a lot share a name with humans who do the same: “boozer.”\nCharles McDermid contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T13:30:01.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
