By Brian Batko / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nMore breaking news on the Pitt uniform front: The men’s basketball team now has some old-school, royal blue-and-yellow script threads like the football team, and they’re just as glorious. \nAfter a photo of a retro Pitt basketball jersey on a mannequin in what appeared to be the Panthers locker room leaked on social media, the official Twitter account of the men’s basketball team lifted a short-lived shroud of secrecy. — Pitt Basketball (@Pitt_MBB) January 20, 2017 \nPretty sharp, right? Not much is known about the uniforms at this point, other than the #PittRetro hashtag flashed at the end of the above short clip. It’s in the same vein as the #PittBlackout promotion of the Panthers’ all-black duds for next Saturday’s Clemson game at Petersen Events Center, so perhaps this will be another highly anticipated jersey Pitt debuts this season. \nThe football version of these throwbacks were met with near-universal praise when they were announced, then finally worn by the Panthers against Georgia Tech at Heinz Field (then again later in the season vs. Duke). Heck, don’t just take it from me, take it from the people who pay much closer attention to this stuff: Pitt’s retro football jerseys were voted best throwbacks on UniSwag.com and are now up for best overall uniform against 12 others . The throwbacks for @Pitt_FB are up for Uniform of the Year presented by @MngrsOnAMission", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T03:55:27.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
