A study done by Longhorn Cattle Company, tested some of the top energy drink brands such as Red Bull, monster etc. What they found might leave your stomach in a knot. They found that the drinks do, in fact, contain bull semen. Analysis of the Bull Sperm in Energy Drinks Rumor \nDespite longstanding rumors to the effect that top-selling energy drinks such as Red Bull , Rockstar , and Monster contain unlisted ingredients such as bull sperm, bull urine and/or testosterone extracted from bull testicles, there is no truth to any of these claims. \ncontinue reading below our video Top 5 Longest Running TV Shows \nWhere did people get this notion? It was apparently inspired by the fact that all of these beverages do contain taurine , which name was derived from taurus , which is Latin for bull . \nScientists chose that name because, even though taurine occurs naturally in all fish and animal tissues (including human tissues), the first time they managed to isolate the amino acid it was from a specimen of ox bile. Ox bile isn't bull semen, it's produced by the gall bladder. But it's still an unpleasant-sounding substance. If that's still worrisome to anyone, rest easy. \nThe taurine used in Red Bull and other energy drinks is completely synthetic. It's not made from animal tissues of any kind. It is an ingredient suitable for vegans. Why Do Energy Drinks Have Taurine? \nWhy do they put taurine in energy drinks? To make good on the name \"energy drink.\" Some studies have suggested that taurine may improve athletic performance and can even, combined with caffeine (another ingredient found in these products), improve mental acuity. Please note the use of the words \"may\" and \"can\" in the previous sentence. Further research needs to be done to confirm that taurine provides these specific health benefits. \nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, up to 3,000 mg. of supplemental taurine per day is considered safe for human consumption. Energy drinks typically contain around 1,000 mg. per serving (one 8.4-ounce can, in the case of Red Bull). \nSome doctors warn that energy drinks should be consumed in moderation , but that's mainly due to their high caffeine content, not because there's any danger of a bull semen overdose. \nSources and Further Reading:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:45:50.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
