I really enjoyed the conversation. He’s a genuine person when you meet him.” \nHe also talked with Ben Carson, Trump’s one-time political adversary and now his nominee for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Harvey indicated that his discussion with Trump and his team could be the first of an ongoing arrangement. \n“We got off to a great start. I think it could be the beginning of something,” he said. “I’ve always been interested in inner-city problems, because they’re huge.” \nHe was quick to note he has no political aspirations, quipping, “I ain’t gonna pass a background check,” but said he met with Trump and his team at the behest of President Barack Obama. \n“It’s just me following orders from my friend President Obama,” he said. “He said, ‘Steve, you’ve got to get out from behind your computer. Stop tweeting and texting and get out there and sit down and talk.' So I stepped from behind my microphone and I came and talked to the guy who’s going to be the 45th president of the United States.” \nThe outgoing and incoming transition teams facilitated the meeting, he said. Harvey will not attend the inauguration , because he is taking a trip to celebrate his 60th birthday with his wife, Marjorie, instead.
