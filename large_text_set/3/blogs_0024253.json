EPA 5 Lukas Podolski strikes a thunderous shot into the top corner \nKeep up to date with ALL the England news, gossip and transfers on our team page \nEngland’s stand-in skipper Gary Cahill said: “We should have won, we had the better chances in the game. I think we’ll look back and reflect that if we took our chances we would have won that game. \n“It’s a learning curve for us. If we’re more clinical in front of goal we win it. I thought we played well, especially in first half and controlled the game.” MOST READ IN SPORT Paige sex tape bombshell as fans express outrage at 'sex act over WWE championship belt' ROYAL FUMBLE British WWE star Paige confirms X-rated leak after videos were hacked from her phone and posted online mark of respect FA plan tribute to security services and victims against Lithuania on Sunday after terror attack FORGETTING SOMETHING?

I felt we did that. We’ve gone into that formation today for the first time. \n“We had one day when everyone’s been out on the training pitch. It’s difficult to put in a new formation and have everyone grasp it straightaway. But there were a lot of positives from that.” Getty Images Gary Cahill was stand-in skipper as Wayne Rooney was not selected Rex Features Chris Smalling, Cahill and Michael Keane did not allow Germany a single shot on target in the first half \nPundit Lee Dixon reckons Southgate’s Three Lions are making progress. \nHe said: “They created chances, they denied chances, the organisation was good and they did everything right in the first half. \n“It was a new system and they looked like they’d been playing it for a while. Every department did their bit. \n“You’d like to see them a bit sharper in attack but you can only tick so many boxes. They have to be really pleased. \n“The flip side of that is that Germany are awful. How many times did they give the ball away? But that’s not England’s problem. Everyone seems relaxed on the ball, which is a great sign.” Naked England football fan dances in the stands as his team take on Germany \nWales legend Ryan Giggs added: “Gareth will have only had a couple of days to work on this system but they’ve played it for their clubs. England pressed very impressively but credit to Germany. \n“England just didn’t get that press right like they did in the first half. Germany changed things and it was a fantastic goal. \n“It was the only thing Podolski did but what a finish in his last game for Germany.” \nSunSport columnist Ian Wright added: “We knew Germany were going to play and they were very poor in the first half but they have good players and came good. \n“Our players will have learned what they will come up against and that they have to maintain the performances in the second half.” AP:Associated Press Adam Lallana was unluckyt to see his shot beat Ter Stegen but rebound back off the post Getty Images 5 Gareth Southgate could not mark his first game as full-time boss with a win but there were positive signs \nJamie Vardy appealed for a first-half penalty after touching the ball past Marc-Andre ter Stegen — but then appeared to run straight into the keeper. Giggs insisted: “Vardy is that quick that he can get the ball. \n“I know he’s been in many situations like that and has got penalties but, on that occasion, once the ball got away from him, everyone knew what he was going to do, including the referee.” \nFormer Three Lions captain Stuart Pearce added: “England looked like they adopted a new formation that worked and enjoyed themselves. \n“A wonderstrike has decided the game and fittingly so.” \nGary Lineker summed up the night as he tweeted: “Football is a simple game. 22 men chase a ball around for 90 minutes. Podolski kicks it really hard and Germany win... again.” Tweet @CharlieWyett", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:57:53.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
