President Trump is expected to sign the measure, which will kill FCC rules requiring ISPs to obtain \"opt-in\" consent from consumers before using or selling sensitive user data, including online browsing activity, mobile app data, and the contents of emails and online chats. \nAs a public service, Motherboard is publishing the names of the GOP lawmakers who voted for the privacy rollback, which consumer advocates called a shameful corporate give-away to the nation's largest broadband companies. \nNot a single Democrat in either chamber voted for the measure. But interestingly, some 15 Republican House members broke ranks with party leadership to vote against the billâ€”perhaps because they decided they'd rather not explain to voters in 2018 why they sold out their constituents' privacy to the highest bidder. \nWe've provided links to the contact pages of every single Congress-critter who voted for this bill. Folks can also use Democracy.io , a tool created by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the San Francisco-based digital rights group, to easily find and email their representatives on Capitol Hill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:21:35.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
