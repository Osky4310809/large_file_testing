And this was before his recent tweets about the United Nations , Israel and North Korea , among other foreign policy issues. \nAnother question that was asked was if Trump could prevent major scandals in his administration. Only 44% said that they were confident he could. For comparison’s sake, the average for the incoming Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations was 76% confidence. \nAnother area where Trump was unable to get even a slight majority to express confidence in him was regarding whether he’d use military force wisely, with only 47% feeling he would. \nThe area where voters felt most confident in Trump was his ability to work effectively with Congress to get things done, with 60% stating their confidence in him. Of course, Trump is going into office with Republicans holding power in both the House of Representatives and Senate. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:53:52.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
