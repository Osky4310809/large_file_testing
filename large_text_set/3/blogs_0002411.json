If it’s the latter case, we need the president to be forthcoming with the evidence that he has as opposed to simply making statements on Twitter. \nOn the other hand, though, we need to know whether there was a political motivation behind this investigation, particularly since it yielded no fruit and seems to have become part of the grist mill of the Democrats’ incessant cries that the president is a Russian patsy. \nIf the Democrats are so keen on an investigation, let’s see them call for an investigation on their own party’s activities, as well. What do you think the odds are on that? \nH/T The Daily Caller \nPlease like and share on Facebook and Twitter with your thoughts on this call from the White House.
