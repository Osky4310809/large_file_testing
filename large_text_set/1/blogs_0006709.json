Of course,\" Wenger said on Thursday morning. \n\"I understand both because at 3-0 down in the head of the players the game is lost, but ideally you want the guys to take the ball and put it in the middle of the pitch.\" \nArsenal are currently eight points adrift of Premier League leaders Chelsea after the Blues were beaten 2-0 by Tottenham on Wednesday night. poll loading Was Giroud wrong to celebrate against Bournemouth? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T12:51:16.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
