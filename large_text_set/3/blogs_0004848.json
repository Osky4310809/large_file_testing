The park, a joint project between Dubai Holding and Dubai Municipality, will feature 18 miles of pedestrian pathways , 12 miles of jogging track, 9 miles worth of cycling tracks and 4 miles of nature trails. As if that’s not enough to keep folks busy, it will also include 55 playgrounds, 45 “sports grounds” five major event venues along with retail spaces for shops, restaurants and cafes. Located in Dubailand, the first phase of construction is set to start later in 2017, with the beginnings of the jogging and cycling tracks, along with some pedestrian walkways. \n“In addition to enhancing the natural landscape and attracting tourists, every major city, including New York, London and Singapore, has an iconic park that reflects its cultural and social identity,” says Dubai Municipality director general, Hussain Lootah. “”The provision of green, open spaces play a pivotal role in elevating the quality of life among residents, creating a desire to explore new pursuits and enjoy favorite pastimes. In addition, such parks act as important links between different parts of the wider city, positioning them as popular destinations drawing people together. \n“The development of this park, in partnership with Dubai Municipality, aims to show off Dubai’s remarkable landscape and position it among the most prominent global cities,” he adds. \nRelated: Dubai plans to launch autonomous flying drone taxis by mid-2017 \nThe park also aims to decrease population density in Dubai to a total of 12.5 square kilometers per person—down 17 percent from its current density. At the same time, adding the large natural landscape and trees is expected to improve air quality in the area surrounding it, while preserving existing biodiversity and enhancing the area’s urban ecology. \nIntegrated into the park will be sustainable on-site power generation, waste recycling, natural shading, wireless internet connectivity – as well as a low water consumption of five liters per square kilometer and a home for 15,000 native and adoptive tree species.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:12:25.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
