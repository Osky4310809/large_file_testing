It corresponds with Makar Sankranti, the winter harvest festival celebrated throughout India, which marks the start of the sunâ€™s six month journey north (the Uttarayanam period) and warmer weather. This occasion honors the sun god, Surya, for providing enough warmth and energy for a prosperous harvest. Festivities feature the preparation of the Pongal dish, which is offered to the sun and shared with loved ones. It's made, facing the rising sun to the east, by boiling the first rice of the season with milk and sugar. The highlight is when the dish spills over during cooking, signifying abundance. Mattu Pongal (January 15, 2017) -- is dedicated to the worship of cows, which provide essential help to farmers in the fields and milk to drink. The cows are bathed and decorated with garlands, turmeric water, and paint on their horns. They're given a special feast (including the Pongal dish) and allowed to rest for the day. The traditional sport of jallikattu (a type of bull fighting) is an integral part of the festival and takes place in villages across Tamil Nadu. However, these days it's become quite contentious due to disapproval from animal rights activists, who want it to be banned. Katya Pongal (January 16, 2017) -- The feeding of birds (especially crows) is considered to be auspicious on this day. Women give the birds special colored rice balls in a ritual called Kaka Pudi Kannu Pudi, and they pray for the well-being of their brothers. This day is also known as Kaanum Pongal. \"Kaanum\" means to see, and it's a fun day that's celebrated by going out with friends and relatives.
