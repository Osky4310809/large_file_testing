He has been found to be a refugee. Australia didn’t respect his rights, and now Fiji is failing to do so,” said Kate Schuetze, Amnesty International’s Asia Pacific researcher. \n“He came to Fiji seeking protection. He is entitled to a fair assessment of his claim. That process must run its course. At a time when the US and Australia are turning their back on refugees, this is a time for Fiji to show that it is different.” White House suggests US may still accept Australia refugees despite clash Read more \nSawari did not immediately seek asylum when he arrived in Fiji but was working with a human rights lawyer, Aman Ravindra-Singh, and Fiji’s human rights and anti-discrimination commission. \n“I told my story to them and they wanted to help me,” he told Guardian Australia on Monday. “They said, ‘What we can do, we will do for you.’ The people here have made me feel safe. I was never, not for one day, safe in PNG.” \nHe said he didn’t feel safe in PNG or Australia, and he feared they would come and get him and take him back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:25:34.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
