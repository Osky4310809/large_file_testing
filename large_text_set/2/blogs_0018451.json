This new image - embedded above - seems to have originated on Weibo (China's most popular Twitter/Facebook-like platform), and shows a white variant of the G6 next to a silver/black G5. While it sports a 5.7-inch display (vs. the 5.3-inch screen of the G5), the G6 is about as taller as its predecessor, and only a bit wider. That's because LG greatly minimized the bezel around new phone's display, which is called \" Full Vision .\" Another thing that's visible in the image is that the screen of the G6 has rounded corners - this was pretty much confirmed by LG itself when teasing the handset's new interface . Breaking away from the G5, the LG G6 is not a modular phone , and has a flat rear (there's no camera bump whatsoever, as recently revealed ). Moreover, the new handset is dust- and water-resistant , which can't be said about any previous global flagship from LG. The LG G6 will be fully unveiled at the end of this week, on February 26 , during a MWC 2017 press event. Stay tuned as we'll bring you more details about the device directly from MWC!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:03:37.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
