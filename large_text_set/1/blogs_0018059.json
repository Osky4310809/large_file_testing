Helmed by Creed ‘s Ryan Coogler, production for the flick began at the top of this year. \nFrom the pictures, we see quite a few familiar faces, which makes us extremely excited for new trailers to leak. Of course, Mr. Wakanda himself, T’Challa — or better known as Chadwick Boseman in the human world — was one of the recognizable faces. Sterling K. Brown has also been cast in the Marvel movie, as has Angela Bassett. And first looks at Lupita N’yongo, Danai Gurira and Martin Freeman caused quite a celebration amongst fans on the web.\nCheck out a few of the first pictures from the Black Panther set below! \nSee Chadwick Boseman, aka T’Challa, and Danai Gurira, aka Okoye. Lupita Nyong’o, who plays Nakia, and Martin Freeman, reprising his role as Everett K. Ross, were also on set.

Another NEW BLACK PANTHER set photo shows Chadwick Boseman dressed in all-black. ! pic.twitter.com/16vhSkzzP4 \n— Best of Marvel (@thebestofmarvel) January 22, 2017 Oh, what we wouldn’t give to be a fly on the wall right about now. Here’s to hoping that a new trailer will be coming sooner than later!\nThese pictures come on the heels of even more Black Panther news. Just days ago, it was announced that writer Ta Nehisi Coates would be expanding the Black Panther comics with a new line called Black Panther & The Crew . That’s in addition to the spinoff series World of Wakanda he worked on with Roxanne Gay and Yona Harvey. \nWe’re planning to get our hands on these new comics ASAP, and we’ve already added the movie to our calendars. 2018 can’t get here fast enough.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:28:55.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
