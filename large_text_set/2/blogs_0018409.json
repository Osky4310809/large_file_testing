Whether your hair is worn naturally coiled or pin straight, frizz can turn a good hair day into a nightmare. One father got a taste of this ongoing issue while dealing with his daughter Alden’s unruly hair. Instead of just complaining, like most of us do, he decided to do something about it and developed a line of products to combat his daughter’s full head of frizzy hair. Boyce Clark, a scientist with a PhD in biogeochemistry and the single dad of a 12-year-old daughter, began researching everything he could to get to the bottom of all the factors that actually cause hair to frizz. “My daughter’s hair would be OK when she would go to bed and in the morning it would be insane, it would literally look like the movie Predator, it was everywhere,” Clark tells Yahoo Beauty. “The more I would brush it, the bigger it would get, and I would think to myself, why?” Boyce Clark’s daughter’s hair before getting treated.

After conducting his initial deep dive into trying out over-the-counter products that didn’t work and doing extensive research, it became clear to him that irregularities in the outer layer of the hair strand allow moisture, such as humidity in the air, to diffuse into the hair and cause it to swell unevenly. Clark handcrafts all Lubricity products with naturally derived ingredients. (Photo: Facebook/Lubricity Labs) More “We started experimenting in the kitchen and as a scientist, I recorded and wrote everything down in a lab notebook,” he says. “I would number the formulas, and we would mix it up in the KitchenAid Mixer. [My daughter] would come in, and I would pull the comb through her hair, and qualitatively determine how the resistance was. I would put one formula on one side of her head and one on the other. Then, we would wash it out, dry it, and then I would pull the comb through again to see if we improved the flow of the hair.” Clark’s daughter, Alden, used plastic wrap to help hair absorb the product while experimenting. (Photo courtesy of Dr. Boyce Clark) More Read More After about nine months of trial and error, Clark became the proud founder and lead cosmetic chemist of a new line of products, Lubricity Handcrafted Hair Therapy , and his daughter’s hair troubles were solved once and for all. “As I was conducting my research, I kept coming across statements such as ‘to increase the lubricity of your hair, you should use silk proteins,'” says Clark. “Lubricity is a real engineering term which means ‘to reduce friction.’ That’s why I named the company Lubricity, because I love the name of it and it’s what our products do. They add lubricity to your hair.” One of the most essential game changers is the Penetrate/Encapsulate Treatment, which is loaded with fruit acids to permanently change the structure of natural hair. Clark explains, “The treatment is really like the flagship. It’s two steps. You apply Step One on dry hair and wait 15 minutes. You do not wash it out. Then, you put on Step Two. Those two chemically react to your hair and they are binding to the keratin protein that naturally occurs in your hair, and it’s changing the shape of that keratin slightly.” Before and after shots of Clark’s daughter’s hair after using the Lubricity Penetrate/Encapsulate treatment. (Photo: Lubricitylabs.com) More “When that shape changes,” he continues, “it does not allow moisture to come out of it or into your hair.” Because the Penetrate/Encapsulate Treatment is a clinical strength product, it is recommended to be used only every 6 to 12 months for best results. After only 30 minutes of Clark using the treatment on his daughter’s hair, her locks were noticeably smoother — without having to add any additional products to touch up. Clark’s daughter, Alden, has been so happy with the smooth texture of her hair. (Photo courtesy of Dr. Boyce Clark) More The Lubricity System is also beneficial on thicker African hair textures as well. Clients of Clark’s have tried the shampoo, conditioner, and Penetrate/Encapsulate treatment, and results have been impressive. For one of his case studies, a woman with naturally textured curls wanted to improve manageability and achieve a softer curl pattern. After only having to use the Q-Shampoo and Q-Conditioner , her hair appeared to be transformed. Before and after shot of client with natural hair who used Lubricity Q-Shampoo and Q-Conditioner. (Photo: Facebook/Lubricity Labs) More “My products are designed to work on the chemistry of hair,” he explains. “So what we have seen is that the results on African hair have actually been dramatically more pronounced than it would be on European, Latina, or Asian hair. That’s because it’s affecting the core, and because African hair has a more exposed core, the protection is going to be even more pronounced.” The products on display at the Lubricity Labs. (Photo: Facebook/Lubricity Labs) More Clark’s daughter is also completely in love with her hair. “After we had the breakthrough, and now that her hair is silky, luxurious, lubricious, and beautiful, she doesn’t have to wake up with it being all over the place anymore,” Clark says. “She loves it! It changed our morning ritual of having 20 minutes of fighting and tears. Now, she just wakes up and goes.” Thanks to her dad, Alden (left) can now say goodbye to consistent frizz forever.
