They don't want him to be in the spotlight at all. \n\"They want him to grow up away from the cameras.\" \nIt won't be a surprise for fans as Cheryl and Liam have always kept their relationship private; they've rarely appeared on the red carpet together and it was only this month Liam actually spoke publicly about Cheryl for the first time. \nThey never even confirmed their pregnancy until February, when Cheryl posed with her baby bump for a L'Oreal and Prince's Trust campaign. \nAnd fans have applauded them for doing so. \nOne tweeted last night: \"Liam and Cheryl handled their pregnancy so well. They kept it so private. I'm so glad. It's [something] only them and their families should be part of.\" \nAnother said: \"During the whole pregnancy Liam and Cheryl have kept everything so private and to themselves and their families. That's the cutest thing.\" \nAnd a third said: \"I genuinely appreciate how private Cheryl and Liam have kept the pregnancy.\" \nFormer X Factor judge Cheryl and popstar beau Liam welcomed their son on Wednesday, but only made the happy news public on Saturday.
