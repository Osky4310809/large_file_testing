The inventive tech company was once best known for its hard-core gaming accessories , like mice and keyboards, but has quickly become a leader in the laptop category with its Blade systems. \nThe newest laptop from Razer is a prototype called Project Valerie, and it's very different from the current Razer lineup, which goes for a slim minimalism. For example, the Blade Pro is a very portable gaming laptop, and the Blade Stealth is a very sharp-looking MacBook alternative. \nBut the new Project Valerie is bigger and bolder. Its 17-inch display is packed into a pretty thick case, but only because there are two additional 17-inch displays hidden in inside the lid. Razer says this is, \"the world's first portable laptop with three built-in monitors .\" Which seems to be true, even if it's only because no one has thought to try an idea like this before. The two extra screens pop out from either side of the main display, via what Razer calls \"an automated deployment mechanism,\" and snap into place without needing user adjustment. \nThe laptop has an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card, which is the current top of the line for laptops , and each of the three displays uses Nvidia G-sync technology , which matches the screen refresh rate and the output of the graphics hardware.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T16:52:07.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
