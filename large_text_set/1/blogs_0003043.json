The timing shouldn't be that surprising since the company released live 360 video on Periscope only last week. But the broadcast showcases another immersive content win for Twitter as it competes with YouTube and Facebook.\nüê†Hold your breathüê† Periscopes First underwater Live 360 broadcast #Periscope360 https://t.co/6tehCevWXe\n‚Äî Mitch oates (@MitchOates) January 3, 2017\nFacebook has yet to host a live 360 video underwater, according to a Facebook spokesperson. That absence comes despite the feature being released in December, nearly three weeks before Periscope. Facebook, however, has featured other 360 videos underwater from outlets such as the New York Times , The LAD Bible and See Australia .\nLive 360 on Periscope and Facebook has only been rolled out to a select number of accounts. Oates does not have access to Facebook Live 360 but does have access to Periscope's, where he has more than 37,000 followers.\nOates quickly decided to take the experience underwater. He has frequently livestreamed on Periscope underwater and his bio on Twitter reads \"world's first surf scoper.\"\nThe underwater stream worked, but didn't go as perfectly as he had hoped. Oates took his viewers underwater about 5 to 10 meters (about 16 to 33 feet) using an iPhone 6 and the Insta360 camera. On Twitter and on Periscope, people could move around the scene with a cursor on a desktop screen or a finger on a smartphone.\nUnfortunately, the stream lasted for under three minutes.\nBattery went flat\n‚Äî Mitch oates (@MitchOates) January 3, 2017\nOates' phone survived, but the battery for the 360 camera died. Oates told Mashable that he had \"fully charged it and it just dropped all of the sudden ... really strange.\"\nYou can bet Oates will be back.\nBONUS: 11 facts you didn't know about Twitter", "external_links": ["https://t.co/6tehCevWXe", "https://twitter.com/MitchOates/status/816423695417651200", "https://twitter.com/MitchOates", "https://www.facebook.com/SeeAustralia/videos/10153947068210909/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/9RGkHiWv.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/LADbible/videos/2937294302984407/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytimes/videos/10150792057009999/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Periscope360?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/MitchOates/status/816425754682540033", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/9RGkHiWv.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-04T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T02:54:56.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
