Doctors at the hospital noted a big drop in the number of firecracker-related injuries this New Year compared to 2016. JODEE AGONCILLO / PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER \nAt total of 43 firecracker-related injuries and four cases resulting from gunshots have been reported to the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center (JRMMC) since Dec 21. \nAccording to the tally of JRMMC as of 2:45 a.m. today, the total firecracker-related injuries comprised of 25 cases of blast burn, 13 eye injuries and an amputation. Most were caused by piccolo and lucis. \nMajority of the injuries involved the hands (20), the eyes (13), arm and forehead (2), lower extremities (2) and the face (1). ADVERTISEMENT \nThe JRRMC counted a total of 149 firecracker-related injuries from the period of December 2015 (48) to January 2016 (101). This is 110 cases less compared to the current figure. \n“Although our goal is zero casualty, we are very happy there are fewer people affected by firecrackers this year,” said Dr. Daverick de Jesus, the hospital’s officer of the day. \nDanivic dela Cruz, 24, was teary eyed from pain after “Bay Blade” firecrackers he was holding blew up in his hands while he was celebrating along Mayor Guerrero St. in Tondo, Manila. \nNurses and doctors were surprised as Jonas Manlapig, 21, who was wearing a black lace see-through dress, walked toward the emergency desk complaining of blast injury. Jonas Manlapig, 21, walked into the emergency room of the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center in a black see-through dress and sought treatment after firecrackers blew up in his hand in Manila on New Year’s Eve 2016. JODEE AGONCILLO / PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER \nManlapig was injured by the kwitis that he lighted along V. Serrano Street in Manila. He was fully made up, wearing a dress and a rubber shoes for a costume party on New Year’s Eve.. \nDe Jesus also noted that most of the cases that involved children were caused by Picolo. \nOne of them, 9-year-old Matt Jolo Arenas injured his finger. \nAnother kid, also injured by Picolo, said he was prodded by friends to try it. \n“I envied my friends who knew how to light firecrackers,” he said teary-eyed when interviewed by Inquirer at the hospital at about 10:30 p.m. \n“I will not try it again,” he said. \nAt about 10 pm, two-year-old Kyo Manga, his father Cristopher and 62-year-old grandmother, Josefina dela Cruz, were on the street when hit by fireworks. \nThe two shooting incidents recorded at the hospital were intentional, De Jesus said. \nOne was the case of a 15-year-old girl who was shot in Malabon. \n“One of the witnesses said, they knew the suspects,” De Jesus said. \nThe Malabon City police is investigating the case. \nThere were also a stabbing case perpetrated by a drunk man, a hit and run incident in Navotas, and adults who were accidentally hit by fireworks. \nSurgeon Mark Anthony Arias, chief orthopedic resident of Jose Reyes, said they were aiming for less than 100 incidents this year. \nArias said their monitoring started in September, but their count for firecracker-related injuries started from Dec 21. \n“The campaign started very early. We (Department of Health) have infomercials, poster campaigns and a shame campaign, in collaboration with the local government units,” he said. \nIn various areas in Manila, more people preferred to blow their trumpets and did not use firecrackers as these are safer and more practical. \nVillage watchman Josie dela Cruz of Barangay 334 in Quiricada, Manila, said she and her husband tied cans to their tricycle as they roamed their barangay to create noise. \n“That’s a lot better and sweeter,” she said. Her savings from not buying 3 Judas’ Belt firecrackers, which cost around 1,500 served as their additional fund for food. \nEarlier, around 50 lechon were served on New Year’s Eve in Pasig City for the annual Pakalog Festival.
