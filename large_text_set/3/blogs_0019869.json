Michael opted for the low offer of £300, which would have been rage-inducing for viewers - if the other two contestants hadn't taken MINUS offers. \nCarole chose to go for -£1,000 and Georgia opted for -£2,000, resulting in accusations they 'backstabbed' their teammate to win the cash. \nLeast happy about it was a man from Scotland, whose daughter shared a video of him having a rant about one contestant taking an offer of -£1,000. \nIn the hilarious clip he clutches the remote and launches a foul-mouthed attack on Carole, who took the offer from the Chaser. \nHe says: \"F***ing going on the programmes and then take a minus offer. \n\"F***in' boy's hard work undone.\" Someone even started a #JusticeForDarragh hashtag And one suggested they should set up a GoFundMe page \nAnother person went a step further and ACTUALLY SET ONE UP. There were Wanted posters And someone even amended the dictionary definition for 'coward' One person tweeted the police Trump has got nothing on The Chase \nThe backlash has even prompted Darragh, the contestant who put £9,000 into the pot, to take to Twitter in defence of his teammates. \nHe said: \"Ease off my teammates. It's a lot easier on the couch.\" \nHe then added: \"Thanks for all the support but I would appreciate it if people eased off my teammates. Its (sic) hard in front of the cameras.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:00:10.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
