A MacRumors reader spotted a new sign in front of the iconic store that reveals the relocation will happen on January 20. FAO Schwarz vacated its location in the General Motors Building in July 2015 due to the rising cost of rent. The space is just a couple feet away from the iconic glass cube, making the relocation largely seamless for frequent customers of the Fifth Avenue store.

The Fifth Avenue location was last renovated in 2011, when larger, more seamless panes of glass were installed. The renovation was completed in November 2011 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T05:55:56.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
