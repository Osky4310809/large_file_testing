Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has told proponents to stop trying to impeach the vice president because she hasn't committed any \"overt acts\" that could be grounds for her ouster. Robredo has criticized Duterte's bloody antidrug crackdown and other policies, but the president says she has the right to free speech and removing her from office will damage the country. AP/Aaron Favila \n  Vice President Leni Robredo agreed with President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday that is too soon into their terms of office for impeachment complaints against either of them. \nIn a wide-ranging interview with DZMM TeleRadyo, Robredo said that an impeachment complaint would distract the branches of government from addressing serious problems the country is facing. \n“Kaya ang sa akin, pareho kami ng ating pangulo, parang masyado pang maaga, nag-align pa lang tayo sa isang political exercise, lilipat na naman tayo sa isang political exercise, at the end of the day, ang bansa ang hindi mag-be-benefit dito,” she said. \n“Siguro, iyong personal, pareho din ng paningin ng ating pangulo. Parang hindi pa isang taon mula ng kami ay nahalal, nanggagaling pa lang tayo sa isang magulong proseso, iyong nakaraang eleksyon.” \nThe vice president clarified that neither she nor her party were consulted in pushing the impeachment of the widely popular Duterte as she disclosed that almost all of the Liberal Party representatives she has talked will not support it. \nRobredo made the statement after weeks of tension between her camp and the president's allies after a critic in Congress filed a complaint against Duterte at the House of Representatives.   \nThe impeachment complaint filed by Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano was immediately followed by a plan by House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez to have the vice president impeached for her supposed betrayal of public trust following her excoriating message to a United Nations side event in which she slammed the government for alleged human rights transgressions in the course of its war on illegal drugs. \nOliver Lozano, a former lawyer of the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos, and Marcos loyalist Melchor Chavez have prepared an impeachment complaint against Robredo. It will need to be endorsed by a member of the House before it can be considered filed, however. \nAfter initially hinting that the vice president was out to grab his post, the president in a speech over the weekend cleared Robredo of any involvement in moves to depose him. \nRobredo also questioned the timing of the complaint against Duterte as she continued to distance herself from the move of the Magdalo representative. \n“Ako naman hindi ako against sa isang impeachment complaint as a whole. Pero ito ba talaga iyong, para dapat kasi last recourse siya. Ito na lang ba ang natitirang pagkakataon? Kahit ayan sa president, tatanungin siguro natin ang sarili natin, ito na lang ba ang remedy na natitira para kung ano man ang problema natin ngayon maresolba?” she said. \nRobredo added: “Marami tayong mga problemang kailangang asikasuhin. Iyong impeachment complaint kasi hindi iyon biro. Nakaraan na tayo sa ilang impeachment complaints dito sa ating bansa. Alam natin kung gaano siya ka-divisive, alam natin kung gaano siya nagpapa-polarize ng mga supporters.” \n“Parang ngayon, sobrang dami nating problemang inaatupag na pag nagkaroon tayo ng impeachment complaint against the President, laban sa akin, parang ang daming trabahong hindi magagawa.” \nRobredo said that when she first heard of the filing of the complaint she already knew that she would be suspected of being behind it since she would directly benefit from Duterte’s removal. \n“Ang naging reaksyon ko... naisip ko na kaagad na finile ito ng Magdalo, wala namang consultation ito sa amin pero parating, parating pagdududahan na naman na kabahagi ako noon. Kasi siyempre pag nangyari iyon I stand to benefit. Kaya ang sa akin talaga, hindi, alam mo iyon, kung ako tatanungin, sana hindi ganito kabilis. Sana napag-usapan, alam mo iyon. Medyo nabigla tayo,” she said. \nMagdalo party-list supported Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV when he ran for vice president in 2016. He offered himself as a vice president to Sen. Grace Poe despite her having Sen. Francis Escudero as her official vice-presidential candidate. \nTrillanes is an ally of the Liberal Party at the Senate.
