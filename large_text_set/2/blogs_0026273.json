As he was preparing to introduce another award presenter, the late night host said, \"You can't really have movies without candy.\" \"It's un-American,\" he said. \"Yeah, popcorn is, too, but we don't have that.\" And with that, as the audience likely nodded in agreement, candy began to fall from the ceiling like magic — and gave us serious Hunger Games vibes (but with a happy ending, of course). Bags of Red Vines and Junior Mints tied up with a bow fell from the theater's ceiling into the crowd members' laps, and their reactions are straight-up priceless. You'll relate to Ryan Gosling on an emotional level as you see his loving gaze, plus more celebs' hilarious reactions, ahead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:30:28.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
