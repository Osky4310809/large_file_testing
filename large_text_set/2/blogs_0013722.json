Scarlett Byrne (who is married to Hugh Heffner’s son, Cooper) announced via her Instagram that she’ll be in the March/April issue of the magazine and that she couldn’t be more excited. 2 \n“I’m very proud to be a part of the March/April issue of Playboy. I penned a short essay along with my pictorial, titled ‘The Feminist Mystique’. A big thank you to @Playboy, the creative team, and @cooperbhefner for such a unique opportunity. #NakedIsNormal” 3 \nHer Fiance Cooper, who is also Playboy’s Chief Creative Officer, announced earlier this week that the magazine would be bringing back nudity for good. “I’ll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated, but removing it entirely was a mistake,” Cooper explained. “Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn’t a problem.
