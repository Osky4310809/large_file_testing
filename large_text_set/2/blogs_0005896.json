Anyone who has walked through its doors knows that it’s way too easy to be distracted by all the beautiful organic food and snacks (don’t even get us started on their bath section)! But just in case we weren’t already entranced, the Bryant Park Whole Foods location has rolled out a new thing we didn’t know we needed, but is actually pretty genius!\nThe NYC Whole Foods now has a produce butcher ! While we’re all pretty familiar with a regular butcher, a produce butcher is someone who cuts and preps your vegetables for you any way you want. It’s such a gift to anyone who has ever wanted to meal prep, but doesn’t have the time (read: too many good things on Netflix)! And while produce butchering sounds like kind of a new concept, it actually isn’t. According to Popsugar , famous Italian restaurant Eataly actually has a produce butcher at both their NYC and Chicago locations.\nOur 468th store opened this weekend in #BryantPark! The store is filled with culinary innovations including a #ProduceButcher, @frankies.pm Spuntino restaurant, a @seedandmill tahini cart that makes fresh tahini, and the Harbor Bar featuring lobster rolls & oyster towers (including 24 beers on tap -and wine!). There is also a #toast venue, Detroit-style deep dish #pizza and @simitandsmith serving authentic Turkish-style artisanal breads. Follow @wholefoodsnyc for even more store deets. #NYC #NewYorkNewYork #MeatlessMonday What's your favorite thing about your local store? \nA photo posted by Whole Foods Market (@wholefoods) on Jan 30, 2017 at 11:59am PST \n\nOf course, the produce butcher is a total hit. At first, people were a little skeptical and joke around, but most are ultimately falling in love with the idea.\nAm I out of touch? It's a question I often ask my Produce Butcher at Whole Foods. pic.twitter.com/WuCq5roaGN \n— Jay Buchman (@Jay_Buchman) January 31, 2017 @WholeFoods I think a #produce butcher is genius! I hate chopping veggies. Unless it's broccoli. Right @danacarvey ?? pic.twitter.com/B86OTVfJjb \n— Amber Howe ⚜️ (@adhowe5) February 4, 2017 A produce butcher in whole food? Awesome!! pic.twitter.com/DG2BTU8hBx \n— Monica OzoresHampton (@MonicaOzoresHam) February 4, 2017 I actually love this, 1 less thing for me to do\n⚡ Whole Foods introduces a 'Produce Butcher' for your veggie needs https://t.co/zKsSavA4kK \n— lil carnita ⚘ (@__Callipygian__) February 3, 2017 But like all things New York, some people were just not having it. The new whole foods by Bryant park has a butcher for produce .Come on NY... if you can cut a bitch , you can cut veggies and fruit too.\n— Linda Michele (@estoylinda) February 4, 2017 Thank God, using a knife was WAY to hard!\n\n⚡ Whole Foods introduces a 'Produce Butcher' for your veggie needs https://t.co/dm3tQISWm8 \n— Court Pavillard (@Quatney) February 4, 2017 #WholeFoods goes 2far: \"a produce butcher on hand, to clean, trim and custom-cut your fruit and vegetables to order\" https://t.co/FKtJOk74FY \n— Tara Hankinson (@tarahankinson) January 23, 2017 The Bryant Park location in NYC is currently the only Whole Foods with a produce butcher on staff, but don’t be surprised if you see one coming to your local store soon.\nSo what do you think? Is this a totally awesome idea? Or should people just julienne their veggies themselves?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:42:01.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
