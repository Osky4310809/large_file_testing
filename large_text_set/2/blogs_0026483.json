Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville have their say on which young striker is better The pair each have 17 strikes with a third of the season remaining, along with all-action Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez Share Kane drew level with Lukaku on 17 Premier League goals (Photo: Michael Regan)   \nHarry Kane's hat-trick for Tottenham against Stoke drew him level with Romelu Lukaku at the top of the Premier League goal charts. \nThe pair each have 17 strikes with a third of the season remaining, along with all-action Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez. \nBoth Kane and Lukaku are 23 and have established themselves among the prime goal-getters in the top flight. \nBut who is better? \nSky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher debated the two hotshots on Monday Night Football ahead of Leicester's win against Liverpool... Lukaku has been in fine form this season (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) Kane is bidding for a second golden boot (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) Gary Neville \n\"I would go with Kane, but I would add a little bit of subtlety and nuance to that in the sense that if you were playing in a team that was struggling and needed a loan striker to run the channels and score a goal by dribbling past people on their own, you'd probably go for Lukaku in that type of team. \n\"Ultimately they are both huge talents. I'd go for Kane, but if you're in a certain type of team you may go for Lukaku as a different type of striker who can have more impact across the back four.
