Surgeons battled for eight hours trying to save her \nDr Singhota studied medicine and physiology at the University of Edinburgh and was due to graduate from the Royal College of Anaesthetists in March. \nThe second of three sisters, who grew up in Bedford, she had recently completed a qualification course to work as an emergency doctor on board London’s air ambulance. \nShe had spent time working on conservation projects in Madagascar and children’s hospitals in New Zealand and had ambitions to work for Medicin Sans Frontieres helping people caught up in the world’s most dangerous warzones. \nHer sister Nicole, 22, a student, said: “I don’t know what to do now, we were best friends. I feel a lot of my own pain for losing her but I’m more upset for my sister and what she didn’t get to achieve. \n“She was so modest but her brain was amazing, she could have developed a cure for something. She was a role model and guided me so much through life. \n“It’s such a waste, she worked so hard to get all her qualifications and graduate and she said it was finally time to relax and enjoy life. Her sister grieving sister paid tribute to her 'best friend' who was killed while crosssing the road \n“My parents are broken and are really struggling. It’s one thing to lose a sibling but worse to lose a child. \n“It’s so typical of my sister on her very last day on Earth she was helping others.” \nShe said that as welll as pursuing a medical career, her sister was a grade eight pianist and a passionate netball player. \nHer elder sister Neha Santasalo, 32, urged witnesses to the collision at the junction of Thurlow Park Road and Birkbeck Hill at 7.30am on Wednesday, January 25 to come forward. Motorcyclists shut down King's Road in vigil to biker killed in smash \nShe said: “When we were little she was always getting into trouble for helping people she didn’t know, everything she has worked for was always about helping others. \n“We didn’t realise there was so much love for her, we are completely overwhelmed by the amount of support of people pouring in. At the hospital where she worked they held a minute’s silence for her, she was adored by her colleagues. \n“We’re at this point of absolute desperation. We need to know what happened to her.” \nHundreds of friends and colleagues have left messages and tributes on a Facebook page set up in Dr Singhota’s memory. \nA former teacher wrote: “It may be a cliche but Jasjot packed more into her own short life than most people manage in a lifetime. \n“A formidable student, a natural leader and talented sportswoman but, more importantly, a warm, gracious and caring person. The medical profession have lost a special doctor.” \nA colleague at St Thomas’s added: “Jas was an absolute delight to work with: always smiling, friendly, quick-witted, efficient, and extremely competent. \n“She was wonderful with patients, relatives, and staff alike. I always knew that it was going to be a good day on labour ward when Jas was on as well. She will be deeply missed by all of us here.” \nA Scotland Yard spokesman said the driver of the car stopped at the scene and is assisting police with their enquiries. No arrests have been made. \nAnyone who witnessed the collision or has any information is asked to contact police on 020 8543 5157.
