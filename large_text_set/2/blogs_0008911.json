Woohoo, go Joel Embiid - my hero!!!!\" or, \"NOOOO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! You're injured!!\" \nMaybe more are now thinking the latter since on Saturday news broke that Embiid has a \"very minor meniscal tear,\" and not a bone bruise, as was previously reported . He hasn't played in a game since Jan. 27. Colangelo said Embiid's MRI after injury vs. Portland revealed \"very minor meniscal tear.\" — Jessica Camerato (@JCameratoCSN) February 12, 2017 Colangelo on Embiid meniscus: \"It was not thought to be acute & it was not thought to be the source of the pain, inflammation or symptoms.\" — Jessica Camerato (@JCameratoCSN) February 12, 2017 Colangelo on Embiid meniscus tear: \"It's not thought to be an acute injury, meaning likely or could have been pre-existing.\" — Jessica Camerato (@JCameratoCSN) February 12, 2017 \nHowever, Embiid has an answer to anyone hating on him for dancing on stage with Meek Mill: He says he's 23 years old, that he's been doing things like this the whole year and he's not going to stop having fun.
