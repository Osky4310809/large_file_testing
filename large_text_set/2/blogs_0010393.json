She didn’t perform or do anything official (since she’s only five), but she was owning it — and with an adorable sidekick, no less! And who was that, you ask?\nTurns out Blue Ivy’s cute BFF was Jay Brown’s daughter Madison . That’s Jay Brown as in the president of Roc Nation. And Jay Z’s business partner — now it all makes sense. And the two girls were having so much freaking fun (who wouldn’t…hello Grammys!) hanging out together; Blue Ivy in her slick pink Gucci power suit and Madison in a white dress with matching bow in her hair. And they were even featured in James Corden’s all-star Carpool Karaoke ! Living their best life.\nBlue Ivy is so precious pic.twitter.com/PgcuYirZld \n— Common White Girl (@girlposts) February 13, 2017 When Bey accepted her award on stage, Blue Ivy and Madison were her biggest supporters.\nPlease stop. #BlueIvy cheering for Bey was the cutest thing ever. I had to immediately gif it. #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/0U2ioQtdxm \n— Miss TLC (@IAmMissTLC) February 13, 2017 Um, can Blue Ivy hurry up and get her own Twitter and Insta account like Dream Kardashian , so that we see all her bestie activities? Also, we can’t wait for Beyoncé’s twins to arrive so that they can be added to Blue Ivy’s charming entourage!\nWe would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters \nA post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST \nWe can’t imagine what it must be like growing up when your mom is Beyoncé and your dad is Jay Z, but we’re sure it’s pretty darn great. Little Blue Ivy seems like a spirited little girl, and we can’t wait to see her evolve into the person she’s going to be.\nIn the meantime, she’s five and wearing Gucci to the Grammys. Yep. Living her best life.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:49:11.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
