Xabi Alonso explains his decision for retiring in the summer once Bayern Munich's season ends. \nXabi Alonso does everything in life with class. From his performances on the football pitch to the way he announced his retirement from the game. \nThe former Spain midfielder also acted with supreme dignity when he jokingly reminded his current manager of losing a Champions League final after one of the greatest comebacks football has ever seen . \nIndeed, the Bayern Munich player, who announced this week that he will hang up his boots at the end of the season , was discussing his career at a news conference. \nWith Carlo Ancelotti beside him, the subject of his time at Liverpool came up. \nAlonso mentioned the Champions League final penalty-shootout victory over AC Milan in 2005 which he took part in and duly reminded Ancelotti, who was manager of the Italian side at the time, of the famous comeback in Istanbul. Xabi couldn't resist to remind Ancelotti, his current coach at Bayern, of Liverpool Istanbul comeback during his retirement speech haha pic.twitter.com/9hgXI8Q5xd \n\"I was lucky enough to play a fantastic final,\" Alonso said, before turning his head toward Ancelotti, simply smiling. \n*cue laughter from the reporters* \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
