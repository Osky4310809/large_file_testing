Every team gets up when playing in front of a huge crowd like that, and not to have anyone there this year was sad because that tournament used to be very very good. \n\"Perhaps take it to the islands. I'm sure they'd love it. \n\"Samoa would surely jump at it, to run a sevens tournament like that. Fiji would jump at it, you know. Take it somewhere they really see the value in having a sevens tournament in their country.\" \nAfter hosting the All Blacks in a historic Test at Apia Park in 2015, Samoa could host a Sevens tournament at the venue while Fiji's national stadium in Suva can hold about 20,000 fans. \nIf Wellington does not host the tournament anymore, Dunedin's Forsyth Barr Stadium and the Waikato Stadium in Hamilton are other options in New Zealand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T12:40:16.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
