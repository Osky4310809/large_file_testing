Bye bye, Jammeh \nOn Sunday, a Barrow aide accused Jammeh of plundering millions of dollars from the state coffers in his final weeks in power before flying to Equatorial Guinea. \n\"Over two weeks, over 500 million dalasi ($11 million) were withdrawn\" by Jammeh, Mai Fatty said in Dakar. \"As we take over, the government of The Gambia is in financial distress.\" \nJammeh also took luxury cars he piled onto a Chadian cargo plane, Fatty said. 'Torture, killings' \nIn addition to the accusations surrounding Jammeh's wealth, s ections of the security services under the ex-ruler personal control have been accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings, torture and arbitrary detention during his rule, rights groups say. \nA truth and reconciliation committee is Barrow's \"preferred method\" of dealing with grievances against the previous government, according to his spokesman, but many Gambians take the harder line of his new vice president. \nCritics have also raised concerns over a statement issued by the UN, regional bloc ECOWAS and the African Union that seemed to offer Jammeh comfortable guarantees in return for his exit. \nThe statement said \"no legislative measures\" would be taken that against Jammeh or his family, noting that he could return when he pleased and that property \"lawfully\" belonging to him would not be seized.
