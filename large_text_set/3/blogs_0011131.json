It was an entire game of chance and Bassey eventually picked the blue stone. \nFormer head of house for two times in a row, ThinTallTony lost after he, like other housemates drew white stone. This win gave Bassey the power to save and replace any housemate after today’s nominations. \nIt was Bassey who suggested that the housemates sing a birthday song for TBoss as a surprise on her birthday. \nBassey has continued to show himself as an entertainer with his recent role as the Master of Ceremony (MC) for the wedding between Efe and Marvis last week. \nHe did the job excellently, gaining more fans. \nMeanwhile, the eight contestants await nominations as the struggle for N25Million and a Kia Sorento car gets tougher, with the show finale drawing closer. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:23:04.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
