One example was the following from actor Samuel L. Jackson. Warning: Explicit and racist language. OK!! Ben Carson….I can't! Immigrants ? In the bottom of SLAVE SHIPS??!! MUTHAFUKKA PLEASE!!! #dickheadedtom \n— Samuel L. Jackson (@SamuelLJackson) March 6, 2017 \nIn response to Jackson’s tweet, attorney, author and TV talking head Star Jones issued a vile racial slur of her own toward Carson. It’s one that would have resulted in at least a temporary ban from the social media network and widespread condemnation if it had been launched by a white person against a black liberal, but which is apparently perfectly OK when directed at a black conservative by a black liberal.   \nJones wrote, “Did Carson start out as a self-hating coon, or did he develop his ‘coonery’ over time? # QuestionsThatKeepMeAwake” Did Carson start out as a self-hating coon, or did he develop his \"coonery\" over time? #QuestionsThatKeepMeAwake # https://t.co/N1Tgys6i25 https://t.co/rOqWTb4Q0R \n— Star Jones (@StarJonesEsq) March 6, 2017 \nPrior to that, Jones had tweeted another message on the same topic in which she called the accomplished doctor a “s*** for brains” and “Uncle Tom.” LHM!
