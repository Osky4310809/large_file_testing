I am very happy here. But in football, everything is precarious and can change very quickly. \n“He means a lot to me. Our relationship goes beyond football. It's a meeting of minds. He will one day be the best coach in the world. He already is for me. His presence and our relationship are the things that matter most to me.” Lloris keeps out Raheem Sterling (Photo: SilverHub/REX/Shutterstock) The France No.1 keeps his eyes on the ball (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Read More Tottenham's Kyle Walker not conceding the title race despite Chelsea's 10-point lead with 10 to play \nAsked about his future ambitions, Lloris added: “There are things you cannot refuse. But that does not mean I am desperate. \n\"There are teams that demand admiration. They are monsters because of their past, their legendary status. In 10 or 15 years, these clubs will still be winning. \n\"This is not the case for everyone. Tottenham is not a club used to winning but we are trying to create something. It is not easy to fight against the European monsters but it remains a motivation.” \nMeanwhile, Kyle Walker promises his Spurs side will not give up on catching Chelsea despite falling 10 points behind in the title race.
