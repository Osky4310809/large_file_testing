Democrat Jessica Farrar has proposed HB 4260 with the title the Man's Right to Know Act , which states that in addition to charging men $100 fines for masturbating, they would be required to have rectal exams before a vasectomy, a colonoscopy, or a prescription for Viagra.\nFarrar has referred to this bill as \"satirical,\" and she's well aware of the backlash she'll receive from this proposition. But she wants to open legislators' eyes to the almost identical restrictions they are putting on female reproductive rights. The bill suggests a fine for \"unregulated masturbatory emissions,\" which means that \"emissions outside of a woman's vagina, or created outside of a health or medical facility, will be charged a $100 civil penalty for each emission, and will be considered an act against an unborn child,\" Farrar wrote in the proposal.\nRelated:\nSomeone Get This Girl an Award For Her Sign Comparing Viagra and Birth Control\nIn the four-page legislation, she points out that men seeking a Viagra prescription, a colonoscopy, or a vasectomy should also be given a booklet titled \"A Man's Right to Know,\" which would detail \"the benefits and concerns\" about these procedures. Farrar explains that in the same way a woman seeking an abortion is required to read \" A Woman's Right to Know \" in Texas, a man's reproductive choices should be treated the same way. There are similar Woman's Right to Know Acts in Oklahoma and North Carolina as well.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/HB04260I.pdf#navpanes=0", "http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/78R/billtext/pdf/SB00835I.pdf", "https://dshs.texas.gov/wrtk/", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FJFarrar%2Fphotos%2Fa.443626406695.247127.370414661695%2F10151508816196696%2F%3Ftype%3D3&width=500"], "published": "2017-03-14T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:09:27.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
