The new cool thing to do is having a girls' night in (read more about this, on our website here ). We are all about living balanced and conscious lives, and choosing the warmth and cosiness of your home, instead of spending the night sipping on expensive cocktails wearing too much make-up and uncomfortably high heels, is a part of this new holistic living. What we're saying is... we'd rather stay in, drink some flavonoid laden wine, and truly bond with our sisters, than spend a night in a state of hazy intoxication. So, if you haven't already stepped on to the girls' night in bandwagon, do so now keeping this checklist in mind: Good wine Red wine is better than white wine. More flavonoids, better for the health, etc. Frankly, it also tastes better. But, make sure you pick up a good wine that is made with grapes that are good not just for the taste buds, but also the soul. A Netflix subscription Because watching anything really with your girlfriends is cathartic. It helps you release pent up emotions, sanctions you to talk about them, and brings you closer. A ‘No-Boys’ pact No texting your boyfriend, no stalking the ex, no inviting the fuck buddy. Girls night in is for the soul. We spend enough time in our daily lives thinking and talking about, or to, men. Take a break from all that testosterone, and focus on solidifying the bond with your soul sisters. Food What's a night with the girlfriends without some food to gorge on, right? Get that jar of mud cake, that extra large pizza, and that second jar of tiramisu. Feed your soul, for once. Cosy blankets In case you want to just snuggle up under the blanket, and talk about love, life, and the universe. Pyjamas A dress, and fancy shoes, is not an appropriate outfit for a night in with the girls. You need to be in your pyjamas so that it's not uncomfortable when you fall off the back of the couch, laughing hard at the stupid joke your friend made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:45:18.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
