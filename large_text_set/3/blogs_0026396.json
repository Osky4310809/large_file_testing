According to the station, Immigration and Customs Enforcement placed a detainer on Melendez with plans to deport him.   \nAs far as the mainstream media goes, they have been keeping mum about the murder. \nIt’s no surprise either. The crime doesn’t fit the liberal media’s pro-illegal immigrant agenda. In fact, major news networks have consistently criticized President Donald Trump’s efforts to secure the U.S.-Mexico border and keep as many violent criminals out of the country as possible. \nIt’s a tragedy that the media will stop at nothing to hold on to their liberal agenda, even if it means ignoring the death of innocent Americans to do so. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and tell us why you think the main stream media won’t report the crime.
