(Unless tampons and hemorrhoid cream are romantic to you, in which case more power to you.)\nOh look who we found in @sainsburys . Day 2 filming for #rednosedayactually going well... actually. pic.twitter.com/FHvBtZ6Nj7 \n— emma freud (@emmafreud) February 23, 2017 It’s important to note that the characters Rufus interacted with in Love Actually , Harry and Mia, will not be returning for the sequel. Alan Rickman, who played Harry, died in 2016, and it’s understandable why his onscreen wife and real-life close friend Emma Thompson wouldn’t want to sign up for the project without him. \nThat means Atkinson will likely be tormenting someone new, and with Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Andrew Lincoln, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and more all confirmed, we truly can’t wait to see who it is. \nOh Rufus. There's something unexpected in the bagging area. #rednosedayactually day 2. Done. pic.twitter.com/fnk6lNZmyr \n— emma freud (@emmafreud) February 23, 2017 We are also very jealous of the extras who were #blessed enough to spend their day in line watching Atkinson do his thing.\nThe extras. #rednosedayactually shoot. Can't quite see the star yet.... pic.twitter.com/EltJjslJm6 \n— emma freud (@emmafreud) February 23, 2017 Freud just revealed an upcoming contest to hang out with the cast on set, so you bet your bottom dollar we’ll be tuned in to her Twitter account waiting for more details. \nComing later today... a competition to win an evening hanging out with us on the set of #rednosedayactually for the final day of shooting.\n— emma freud (@emmafreud) February 23, 2017 (If you need someone to hold up Lincoln’s signs, we’ll totally do it.)\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:13:53.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
