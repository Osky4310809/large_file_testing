How? It was pushed back up it's body. And oh boy, it's as gross as it sounds.\nSEE ALSO: A family found a rattlesnake in their toilet â€” then 23 more\nTrish Prendergast, a snake handler, explained to ABC News that the would've starved if the ball hadn't been removed. \"[The tennis ball] may have broken down over ... 12 to 18 months,\" she told the news outlet. \"But in the meantime, the snake would not have been able to eat...\"\nParaffin oil was used to lubricate the ball, and it took over 20 minutes for Prendergast to manipulate the snake and get the ball out of its body.\nIt's a tricky job, and one that can cause damage to the oesophagus if not performed correctly.\nA video of the removal was posted on the Facebook page of Townsville Snakecatcher .
