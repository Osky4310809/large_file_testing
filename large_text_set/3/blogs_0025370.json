A campaign like 'Namami Devi Narmade - Sewa Yatra' has never been conducted so far.\" By: PTI | Bhopal | Published: March 26, 2017 5:32 PM Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev (PTI) \nSpiritual Guru Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to run a campaign for conservation of rivers in the country akin to ‘Namami Sewa Yatra’, currently underway in Madhya Pradesh. “I will discuss with the Prime Minister and the Union Ministry for Environment to have a campaign like the ‘Namami Devi Narmade – Sewa Yatra’ across the country to make people aware about the importance of river conservation,” he told a gathering yesterday at Shahganj in Sehore district. Sadguru Vasudev was in the town to participate in the ongoing Narmada Yatra. He added, “The Indian civilisation flourished between Narmada and Godavari rivers, which are shrinking now. This means that we are not worried about our future. A campaign like ‘Namami Devi Narmade – Sewa Yatra’ has never been conducted so far.” \nHe said efforts should be made to run an awareness campaign for river conservation from Kanyakumari to Uttarakhand. “The talks are being held with the Union Government to save rivers. The rivers used to flow incessantly when forest was unharmed in India,” he said. “It is necessary to protect the soil next to the bank of rivers, otherwise it will convert into sand turning areas surrounding the rivers into a desert,” he said. Union Minister for Rural Development Narendra Singh Tomar, BJP ’s national spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain also participated in this campaign along with Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. \nAlso Watch: \n‘Namami Devi Narmade – Sewa Yatra’ was started on December 11 last year from Amarkantak, the source of river Narmada. The state government has claimed that this is one of the biggest river conservation campaigns in the world. Please Wait while comments are loading...
