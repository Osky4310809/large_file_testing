That's the oldest newborn that I've ever seen. So unrealistic,\" ranted one fan. \nA second confused fan said: \"Leanne's given birth to the only baby old enough to qualify for a State Pension. #Corrie\" \n\"That baby looks about 25. #corrie,\" joked another. \nEarlier this week, viewers were distracted by some major flaws in the storyline as Leanne Battersby gave birth to her baby just minutes after going into labour - while trapped in a lift with her sister Toyah. \nNoticeably, there was also no mess following the birth with the baby looking super clean as Leanne held it in her arms - and other viewers demanded to know who cut the umbilical cord from around the baby's neck .
