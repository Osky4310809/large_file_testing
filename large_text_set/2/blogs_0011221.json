After a month of Donald Trump’s White House, I’m starting to think that movie is more of a prophecy than a work of a deranged stoner mind. Like, if TMZ somehow obtains a pic of Michael Cera doing cocaine in a strip club bathroom while banging a porn star, we might as well just pack it up and wait for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in total anarchy.\nSeth Rogen, a lovable Canadian, noticed that Donald Trump Jr. follows him on Twitter. So he did what anyone tries to do in that situation — Slide into his DMs. Except this is for the sake of humanity, not like the time I noticed Kylie Jenner followed the BroBible Twitter for a hot second and I threw out a “tell Tyga we said sup?”\nYo! @DonaldJTrumpJr ! I noticed you follow me on Twitter. Please ask your dad to resign before he destroys the planet. Thanks dude.\n— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017 \nLet's see if this works! pic.twitter.com/q5b3d8U4Nx \n— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017 \nIf @jasoninthehouse won't investigate Flynn's ties to Russia, maybe I can get his boss' son to help me do it. pic.twitter.com/bmOfDDepC3 \n— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017 \n\nSave us with those”uh-hu ” laughs, Seth. You and your bong of justice are our only hope.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:15:50.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
