And if you haven't gotten your ass down there yet to see her, you really should, because she's amazing. \nThe easiest way to describe Young's music is \"Kate Bush on crack,\" but there's more to it than that. She uses piano, synths, a punk-rock rhythm section and her melodramatic vocals to conjure moods ranging from frantic (\"Pearl of a Girl,\" off 2014's The Knife Shift ) to defiant (\"Son of Man,\" from 2009's excellently titled Music for Strippers, Hookers and the Odd On-Looker ) to tender (the new \"I Love You SOOOO Much,\" a Prince-like power ballad featuring Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid), often turning on a dime several times in a single song. Live, she's a theatrical presence, pummeling her keyboard and hitting high notes that her unhinged music and muscular bass/drums backing duo seems to be physically forcing out of her. \nLongtime David Bowie producer Tony Visconti has worked on several of Young's albums — in fact, he was there to introduce her at the Hi Hat last week. She's also collaborated with the likes of Dave Grohl, Nick Zinner, Patrick Stump, Placebo's Brian Molko, Morrissey (for whom she's opened several tours) and Bowie himself, who sang a duet with Young on another excellently titled album, 2003's Breasticles . \nIf you're still not convinced Ms. Young is worth getting to know, this brand-new video she recently shared with L.A. Weekly should help seal the deal. This is a live performance of \"Nice,\" the lead track off Live at the Witch's Tit. The video was shot at St. Vitus in Brooklyn by Byron Mansylla and the lyrics are below.
