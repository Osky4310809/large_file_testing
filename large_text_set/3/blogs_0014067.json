In fact, Soap Cherie's unicorn bath bombs prove just how easy it is to jump aboard the magical beauty train, one soak at a time. Soap Cherie, a Williamsburg, Brooklyn-based bath and body company, seems to be taking cues from mega bath bomb retailer, Lush , with its latest tub accessories: Instagram-worthy pink-and-purple bath bombs topped with glittery golden horns. And you know what? We're not mad at it. Not only are the colorful bath bombs (too) pretty to look at in—and out of—the tub, they're also made of natural and organic ingredients, like nourishing shea butter, which means when using, you should feel confident knowing you're soaking in a multi-color whirlpool of safe-for-your-skin ingredients.

There's moisturizing borage and jojoba seed oils-based body lotions, coconut oil shampoo bars scented with essential oils to cleanse strands and soothe scalps, and even exfoliating lip scrubs made with cocoa butter and cane sugar to slough off dry, flakes from lips.
