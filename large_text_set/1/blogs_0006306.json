The Federal Government had on Friday directed the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency to move the mobile control tower at the NAIA to the KIA in order to allow engineers repair the former’s runway and taxi ways. But while El-Rufai commended the Federal Government for the move, Fayose criticised the move, saying it was too risky and dangerous to divert local and international flights from Abuja to Kaduna. During a visit by the Minister of State for Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, to El-Rufai at the Sir Kashim Ibrahim House, Kaduna, the latter — represented by the Speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Alhaji Aminu Shagali — said the state was committed to ensuring smooth flight operations throughout the six-week period. He said, “We are delighted about the choice of Kaduna International Airport by the Federal Government to divert traffic from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport as a result of the proposed repairs of the runway. We have put in motion processes and activities towards making the Federal Government’s decision a success. “I want to assure all Nigerians and the international community, particularly stakeholders in the aviation industry that Kaduna State will rise up to the challenge.” Sirika expressed satisfaction with the ongoing work at the Kaduna International Airport, saying works on the main terminal as well as the control tower would be completed by the end of February to meet the March 8 deadline. But in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Idowu Adelusi, Fayose criticised the Federal Government’s move to divert flights to Kaduna, describing it as a “knee-jerk approach” to problems. Fayose described the security situation in Kaduna as worrisome, saying it portended risk and danger to passengers. He said, “This same Kaduna was where the Shi’ites waylaid a whole Chief of Army Staff; the crisis created has yet to abate as the Shi’ites continue to defy the authorities to mount public protests. “This is the same Kaduna where over a thousand citizens have been slaughtered like rams and the Federal Government has not brought any of the murderers to book. The situation in southern Kaduna and other parts remains as tense as ever.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:19:18.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
