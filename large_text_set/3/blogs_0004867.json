(Johanna Neuman) \nIn Sacramento and in Washington, the Harvard -trained attorney was known for being scholarly, thoughtful and unafraid to take positions that crossed party lines or aroused hostility in voters. Some even called his votes quirky. \nHe voted against creating a federal Department of Education, calling it a matter for states. He also opposed making Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday a national holiday, saying federal employees did not need more holidays. He sought higher taxes, lobbied for deficit reductions and proposed measures to curb illegal immigration. \nBeilenson long opposed special-interest political action committees and openly championed civility. U.S. News and World Report once singled him out for his integrity, calling him a “straight arrow.” \nState Sen. Henry Stern (D-Los Angeles) said Beilenson was “a creature of a different age in American politics — where comity across party lines was not inconsistent with fervent democratic debate.” \nIn 1995, as partisan rancor intensified under then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Beilenson announced his retirement. He told The Times that the spike in right-wing ideologues blocked compromise and made him averse to coming to work each day. \n“What has really bothered me about the congressional environment now is all this ideological and mindless politics,” Beilenson said. “Moderate, sensible, middle-of-the-road resolutions of issues seem no longer possible.” Morning fog in Chesebro Canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Aream which Anthony Beilenson helped protect..

(Brian Vander Brug / Los Angeles Times) \nAnthony Charles Beilenson was born Oct. 26, 1932, in New Rochelle, N.Y. His parents owned a small book publishing company, and he grew up in an affluent suburb outside New York City. \nAfter graduating from Phillips Academy, he attended Harvard University, where he earned an undergraduate degree in American government. \nHe moved to California after graduating from Harvard Law School in 1957, and after a stint in his cousin’s entertainment law firm, he entered local politics. \n“I wanted to be useful in the world,” he told The Times in 1981 of his decision to seek public office. “Politics was the way you could acquire the most power to do good things.” \nHe was first elected to the state Assembly in 1962, representing a solidly Democratic district that included Beverly Hills and West L.A. Four years later, he was elected to the state Senate. \nIn 1976, after Rep. Thomas Rees announced his retirement and said “the Watergate mess” had cast a pall over public service, Beilenson joined the race to succeed him. \nAmong his top priorities were improving the economy and protecting natural resources, and Beilenson soundly defeated his Republican challenger. \nIn addition to his son, Beilenson is survived by his wife, Dolores; another son, Peter; a daughter, Dayna Berger; and nine grandchildren.
