Tesla had originally planned to start production of its cars in July, but at this stage, the company is still preparing to order initial runs of parts for Model 3 production from its suppliers. While it may not be ready to start manufacturing the Model 3 just yet, Tesla has put plans into motion to prepare its factory in Fremont, California, for the new vehicle. The company will pause production of the Model S and Model X at the facility to expand capacity of its paint shop and perform general maintenance on equipment, a fact first reported by Electrek and confirmed in a Tesla statement. “Tesla will begin a brief, planned pause in production for a week in February to prepare for Model 3 production,” a company spokesperson told The Verge . The pause “will allow Tesla to begin Model 3 production later this year as planned and enable us to start the ramp towards 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018. We do not anticipate this brief pause to have a material impact on our Q1 production or delivery figures, as we have added production days to compensate.” The Fremont factory has been retooled several times since 2012 — most recently in 2014 , in preparation for Model X production.
