The creative teams over at Marvel have been pretty mum about the whole thing, but they seem to downplay the idea when they're asked about it. For awhile, it has seemed like that crossover just isn't going to come to fruition. The actors however, would love to intertwine their worlds. Vincent D'Onofrio, who plays Kingpin on Daredevil , has expressed how much he'd love to work with the movie characters in the future. Apparently, Chris Prat t feels the same way. During a Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 set visit, Pratt was asked if there was any character he'd really like to work with. The actor quickly dropped two of the biggest names in the Marvel TV shows. \"Yes! There’s so many! I don’t know what’s possible now that Marvel is under Disney and some Marvel characters are under different studios, some are in TV, and some are - I don’t know how it works - I think it would be awesome for Starlord to meet Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin somehow. [Laughs] That would be awesome. I was always a fan of The Punisher. That was my dude who I loved growing up. I had the murals of him on my wall and stuff, so that would be pretty awesome. Maybe a little more moody than Quill. I don’t know exactly how they would work together.\" The interviewer immediately joked that this meant a Guardians/Defenders crossover was in the works, and Chris laughed along with them. \"Hey, I feel like we can do that nowadays, right? Look, I’m clearly not responsible for making any of these decisions. I’ll kinda do anything they want me to do.\" \nMORE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2: First Good Look At Taserface / James Gunn On Guardians Working With Avengers / Is Yondu A Member Of The Guardians Now? / James Gunn Reveals How Many Were Up For The Ayesha Role / Did Ego The Living Planet Show Up In Super Bowl Spot? / New Dancing Guardians / Concept Art Shows Off Star-Lord's Space Pirate Style / Guardians Star Comments On Drax's New, Surprising Friendship / New Photos Released / James Gunn Releases Another Piece Of Guardians VOL. 2 Score / Make Your Own Groot Cake / Mantis Seemingly Confirmed For Avengers: Infinity War / Vin Diesel Says A Groot Solo Film Is Inevitable / First Look At Ego / Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 LEGO Sets Revealed / Every Marvel Studios Hero Confirmed For 2017 Movies \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is written and directed by James Gunn (Slither).
