A 2006 US Army Corps engineering report found the “Mosul Dam is the most dangerous dam in the world” - but the situation has become more precarious since Isis took control of the area in 2014, including, briefly, the dam itself. Many of the 1,500 workers stationed there fled, and the extremists damaged much of their equipment. Read more Iraqis describe horror of life under Isis in Mosul \n“It is just a matter of time. It will be worse than throwing a nuclear bomb on Iraq,” Professor Nadhir al-Ansari of the Environmental Engineering Department at Lulea University in Sweden, who inspected the initial construction, told Al-Jazeera . \nA 2015 study from the European Commission's Science Centre found that even a partial breach of 26 per cent would unleash a flood of catastrophic proportions. \nA wave of water up to 100 feet (30 metres) high would engulf Mosul in two hours, taking with it people, unexploded bombs, buildings and cars, as well as toxic substances from oil refineries and human waste. \nThe surrounding flood plains are already home to more than one million people living in tents after being displaced by fighting who would struggle to find protection from the water.

Iraq’s oil refineries and up to two thirds of its wheat fields would also be affected. \nNew £234 million ($300 million) World Bank funded repairs are being carried out by an Italian engineering company, but the fragile security situation in the area is making completion of the work difficult. Millions in need of aid as Iraqi forces advance on Mosul \nKurdish and Italian soldiers remain on constant guard for extremist attacks. In October, an Isis convoy armed with explosives tried to approach the dam but were killed by Kurdish missiles before they reached it. \nA better and more permanent solution would be to build a second dam - but the political and military instability and lack of funds mean this option is highly unlikely. \nIraqi officials have tried to downplay scientists’ and the international community's fears of an imminent disaster, but Professor Ansari remains unconvinced the problem will be solved in time. \n“I am convinced the dam could fail tomorrow,” he said.
