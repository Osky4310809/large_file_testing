Photo: Sam Mills/Cult of Mac \nThe new (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 might be the hottest item to hit the Apple store today, but there’s a treat for those who prefer its smaller handsets, too. \nThe iPhone SE is now available in 32GB and 128GB flavors, doubling the storage capacity of the previous versions. \nApple hasn’t changed the iPhone SE; it still looks the same as the iPhone 5s and offers the same internals as the iPhone 6s. That means you get a 4-inch Retina display, a 64-bit A9 processor, a still-impressive 12-megapixel iSight camera, and Touch ID. \nBut for those who like to carry lots of music and movies, better storage options are now available. The 16GB entry-level model has now been replaced by a 32GB model, and the 64GB model has been replaced by a 128GB model. \nBecause nothing else has changed, pricing remains exactly the same, starting at $399 and rising to $499 when you buy unlocked. Both options will be available to order alongside the red iPhone 7 and the new 9.7-inch iPad at 8:01 a.m. Pacific (11:01 a.m. Eastern) on Friday, March 24.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:22:05.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
