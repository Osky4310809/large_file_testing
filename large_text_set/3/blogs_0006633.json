Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nCeltic striker Moussa Dembele insists he has consigned his hat-trick against Rangers to the back of his mind as the Old Firm rivals prepare to do battle again on Sunday. \nHe came on as a substitute for the injured Leigh Griffiths in his first Glasgow derby in September and left with the match ball following the 5-1 win. \nDembele netted in his next two appearances against Rangers and has taken his tally for the season to 32, picking up the Premiership player of the month award for February. \n\"It was a big moment in my Celtic career,\" he said on his treble earlier in the campaign. \n\"It was my first hat-trick as a professional footballer and my first league goals too for Celtic.

I will try to keep working and it will come when it comes but I don't think about it. \n\"I have a big game on Sunday. People will know what I am capable of. It is not just about this game, it is about what I have done throught the season. \n\"We will see what happens next week but first we have to take the three points.\" poll loading What will the result be in the Old Firm derby? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T21:12:45.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
