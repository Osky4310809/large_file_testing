The national organization said it has started deferring to the gender identity indicated on enrollment applications, rather than birth certificates.\n\n“I’m ecstatic for everyone that they don’t have to go through what my child went though,” Maldonado told TIME on Tuesday.\nHer son, Joe Maldonado, loved being part of the Boy Scouts team and was devastated when he was kicked out last year. The emotional turmoil from feeling isolated caused him to fall behind in school, his mother said.\nNow, he’s “excited” for the chance to return to the Boy Scouts, his mother said. “Just knowing that he can go back to his Scouts and knowing that he’s accepted, it means a lot,” she said. “It does.”\nMaldonado said Joe will likely join a different Boy Scouts chapter because she does not want him to return to his hometown chapter under its current leadership. The Boy Scouts of America and the Northern New Jersey Council did not immediately return requests for further comment. In the statement announcing the change, the Boy Scouts of America said: “This is an area that we will continue to thoughtfully evaluate to bring the benefits of Scouting to the greatest number of youth possible.”\nMaldonado said she plans to fill out a brand-new application for Joe this week — a moment she said she’ll savor.\n“I’m going to feel very proud that we won,” she said, “just knowing that they didn’t win. Just knowing my kid can go in there if he feels like it. It feels good.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T19:33:27.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
