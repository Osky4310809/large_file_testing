The opposition is almost certain to have a field day if Trudeau becomes the first prime minister in Canada’s history to violate a federal statute — a statute on ethics and conflict of interest, no less —  while in office.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Chartrand/File Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson. The commissioner’s office and the current Conflict of Interest Act were creations of the Harper government in 2007. While Harper was accused by his opponents several times of unethical behaviour, he was neither the subject of any investigation nor any finding of any violation of the act during his time in office.\nTrudeau, then, becomes the first prime minister to face the scrutiny of the commissioner, something he said last week he welcomed.\n“I’ve said a number of times this was a  personal family vacation,” Trudeau told reporters Friday in Peterborough. “And any questions that the ethics commissioner has and that Canadians have, we’re happy to engage with.”\nWhen Trudeau confirmed on Thursday that he had used the Aga Khan’s private helicopter to travel the 115 kilometres back and forth between Nassau and the Aga Khan’s private island, Trudeau said, “It’s something we look forward to discussing with the Conflict of Interest Commissioner but we don’t see an issue on that.”\nThe investigation, though, may also put a spotlight, on the relationship between Dawson and Trudeau.\nDawson’s seven-year-term of office ended in early January but Trudeau extended it for an additional six months while he determines who ought to get the next permanent seven-year appointment or whether he should extend Dawson’s contract again.\nDuff Conacher, the founder of Democracy Watch, said that puts Dawson in a conflict-of-interest herself, investigating the very public office holder who has the power to extend her appointment or approve her re-appointment in six months.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T13:04:18.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
