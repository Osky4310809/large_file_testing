Marcus can be as good as Griezmann in two or three years' time.\" \nAnd Neville has backed Anthony Martial to impress, too, predicting that he and Rashford will learn from veteran team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \n\"You have to be inspired by playing with Zlatan,\" he continued. \"Anthony Martial is the same - he's got the biggest opportunity to become one of the best Man United number nines if he grabs that opportunity. \n\"At the moment he's only grabbed it with one hand - he needs to grab it with two. Martial and Marcus have to learn from [Ibrahimovic], who's phenomenal.\" \nRashford has scored seven goals in 34 games in all competitions this season, while Martial's return is seven strikes in 25 appearances.
