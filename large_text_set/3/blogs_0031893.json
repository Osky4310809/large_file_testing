The Duchess of Cambridge attended the National Portrait Gallery’s 2017 gala, masterfully choosing a gown so magnificent that it rivaled the museum’s artwork itself. Not too shabby, Kate!\nLeaving her precious kids, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, at home with papa Prince William , Kate enjoyed the evening out supporting the museum and mingling with guests. As the National Portrait Gallery’s royal patroness, the 35-year-old dressed for her esteemed role with a gorgeous forest green lace gown, crafted by Temperley London. The Duchess is a longtime fan of the British label, so her selection of this exquisite number comes as no surprise.\nPhoto by Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images To complete the look, the Duchess opted for a breathtaking pair of Kiki McDonough tourmaline and amethyst drop earrings and an iridescent gold Wilbur & Gussie clutch. And of course, her iconic sapphire engagement ring was on-finger to bump this regal look up another notch higher.\nPhoto credit should read NEIL HALL/AFP/Getty Images As per her (perfect) usual, Kate let her gorgeous chocolate tresses down freely into waves. Oh, and her minimalist makeup was ~flawless~ as well.\nWhile many know Kate as the lovable, charitable and style-minded future Queen of England, some may forget that the Duchess is quite the art scholar herself. She graduated from St. Andrew’s with a degree in art history, and has served at the National Portrait Gallery’s patron since 2012. Plus, we’d say her keen ability to pull together winning outfit after winning outfit is just a reflection of her fine-tuned artistic abilities.\nWhat else is there to say, aside from the fact that Kate’s royal style just plain epitomizes perfection? She’s a sublime style icon who just keeps getting better!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:54:03.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
