They've stayed compact, resilient, and strong, putting in tactical fouls when necessary and sometimes surviving by the skin of their teeth. But survive they have. \nAt the other end, an exquisite free kick from record-signing Robbie Brady has been enough to get the home side level. Burnley have looked dangerous at times, but David Luiz has gotten his angles correct so far, despite moving a bit gingerly on his knee. \nChelsea perhaps a bit unlucky to not be ahead. Need the usual second-half improvement, a bit better passing (how many counters wasted today?), and we've got this. \nCOME ON, CHELSEA!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:42:15.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
