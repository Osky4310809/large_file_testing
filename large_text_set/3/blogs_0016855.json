By: Manika Gupta | Updated: March 19, 2017 4:05 PM Yogi Adityanath. (PTI) \nYogi Adityanath, the new chief minister of Uttar Pradesh himself is all of 44 years, and his cabinet is also young. In fact, the old ministers have given way to young blood. Srikant Sharma is 46 years of age, Upendra Tiwari is even younger, Swati Singh is in her 30s, Mohsin Raza, the only Muslim candidate is also 49 years old. And a Sikh Baldev Singh Aulakh is 59 years old. Out of the total of 46 ministers, at least half are young in their forty’s or early fifties which is rare in our political landscape. \nOn the other hand, even women power is on display in the cabinet with Rita Bahuguna Joshi as the first woman minister to be sworn in. Rita Bahuguna Joshi was a MLA from Lucknow Cantt constituency of the state of Uttar Pradesh. She was earlier the president of the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee from 2007 to 2012. \nSwati Singh, is the wife of expelled BJP leader. Dayashanker Singh’s suspension was revoked by UP BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, a day after his wife Swati Singh emerged victorious from Lucknow’s Sarojini Nagar constituency by a comfortable margin. \nWatch this also: \nSingh was expelled from the party for six years after his objectionable remarks on Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati. Interestingly, a few days after Singh’s expulsion, the BSP workers led by Naseemuddin Siddiqui staged a massive protest at Hazratganj Crossing and even indulged in yet another unsavory remark this time against Singh’s wife and daughter prompting Swati Singh to lodge at Hazratganj police station. \nExpelled BJP leader Dayashanker Singh’s suspension was revoked by UP BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, a day after his wife Swati Singh emerged victorious from Lucknow’s Sarojini Nagar constituency by a comfortable margin. \nGulabo Devi is another woman candidate who took the oath today as MoS. Anupama Jaiswal is the BJP candidate who worked very hard to provide relief to the flood-hit areas in Gond and Sitapur areas.
