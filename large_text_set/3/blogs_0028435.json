Podcast Throwing Shade Find Its Audience on Late-Night TV? \n“And I thought she was a lesbian,” Clarke says. \nClarke moved here from New York in 2002, Fielding in 2003, and the two got married in 2008. Clarke was raised Irish Catholic in the suburbs of Maryland, while Edlow is Jewish from Manhattan’s Upper East Side. They have a 5-year-old daughter, Ellis, to whom Edlow affectionately refers as her “little cockblocker.” \nClarke has appeared on The Mentalist , Grey’s Anatomy , Law & Order , Shameless , the upcoming Twin Peaks revival and Steven Soderbergh’s The Informant , in addition to the play The Glory of Living , directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Edlow is a comedian and writer who trained at UCB. In 2010, she wrote a one-man show called Coke-Free J.A.P. , which ran for four months in L.A. She’s the voice of Roxie on BoJack Horseman and also hosts the monthly stand-up night Eat Pray F*ck at the Improv. \nThree years ago Clarke and Edlow were invited to take part in a storytelling night on the topic of forgiveness at Temple Israel in Hollywood. They recounted one of their fights about their DVR, which eventually developed into Bitter Homes and Gardens . They’ve screened the pilot at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and the New York Short Film Festival, where it won best comedy. \nThough Clarke and Edlow live in Larchmont, the eight episodes were filmed at director Rock’s Eagle Rock home, which they describe as “hipster craftsman.” \n“Eagle Rock is cool,” Clarke says. “I’m sorry, are you the geographical arbiter of the Eastside?” Edlow asks. In the series, Larry and Fielding are the archetypal struggling, competitive and self-obsessed actor-writer types; his only notable parts have been as a museum attendant, traffic cop, “fat pervert” and “Frasier’s bloated cousin,” while she’s a wannabe screenwriter who also runs a snack blog. They fight about how he snores too loudly and how she farts too loudly. She picks on this weight and bathroom habits, and he doesn’t like cuddling with her in bed because she has bad energy. “I’m not Chernobyl,” Fielding replies.
