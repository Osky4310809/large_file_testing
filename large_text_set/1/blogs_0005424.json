The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela, where the local currency has lost much of its value , and India, where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation.\nMore broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics — highlighted by Donald J. Trump’s election victory — has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight.\n“The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders,” said Gil Luria, the director of research at Wedbush Securities.\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Still, most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country: China.\nPrice of a Bitcoin $1,000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n2013\n2014\n2015\nTues.\n2016\nSource: CoinDesk | Bitcoin Price Index, plotted weekly JAN. 3, 2017\nBy The New York Times Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their government’s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in China.\nBut the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software, suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story In recent days, the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges, suggesting more demand in China than outside.\nThe importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify.\nIn dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1,025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016.\nThe volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scarcity. In Bitcoin’s case, the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created.\nSign Up for the DealBook Newsletter Every weekday, twice a day, get the news driving the markets and the latest on mergers and acquisitions.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy The recent rise has brought the price of one Bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold, which was about $1,150 on Monday.\nThe price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in Bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors.\nAfter showing early interest in the currency, most big banks have moved on to make investments in the blockchain , the new type of ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, while eschewing Bitcoin itself.\nSome central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that Bitcoin uses.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone with a computer and internet access can open a Bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded.\nBecause it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world, Bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution. That has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously, such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for Bitcoin on the Silk Road website and its successors.\nListen: ‘Bitcoin Divided,’ From Planet Money The writer, Nathaniel Popper, joined NPR’s Planet Money to explore how a behind-the-scenes fight over Bitcoin spilled out into the real world. You can also hear this episode on iTunes .\nNew Bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the Bitcoin network, and previously released Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world.\nSince 2009, the price of Bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement.\nThe only other time the price of Bitcoin has exceeded $1,000 was in late 2013, when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from Chinese investors and traders.\nThe price soon crashed when one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo and went bankrupt, announced that it had lost most of the Bitcoins held by its customers (the cause remains in dispute). The Bitcoin price fell to its low — under $200 — in early 2015.\nSince then, the price has risen in fits and starts, in part because of continuing hacking and fraud, and because of fights over the direction of the Bitcoin network.\nMany Bitcoin businesses have wanted to edit the basic Bitcoin software to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day. But the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic Bitcoin software. Many Chinese Bitcoin companies have sided with the coders .\nPhoto Free Bitcoin coupons were distributed in Hong Kong for the Chinese New Year on Jan. 30, 2014. Most of the people buying and selling Bitcoin today are from China.

The slowdowns have made it harder to use Bitcoin for everyday payments.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story But through the controversy the security of the basic Bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up, making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions.\nIn November, interest in Bitcoin spiked in India after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest Indian bank notes, in an effort to crack down on corruption.\nThe continued fall in the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, has led to reports about Venezuelans desperate to exchange their money for Bitcoin.\nBut despite the new demand, the total value of all outstanding Bitcoin, about $16 billion, is still only that of a medium-size American company, and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of Indians or Venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency.\nThat points back to the importance of speculators, who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to Bitcoin for their daily financial needs, and push the price much higher.\n“I ascribe only 10 percent of the value of Bitcoin to current day usage, and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage,” Mr. Luria of Webush Securities said.", "external_links": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/04/business/04DB-BITCOIN2/04DB-BITCOIN2-master675.jpg", "https://www.npr.org/player/embed/484029238/484036301", "http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2016/02/02/cio-explainer-what-is-blockchain/", "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js", "https://www.unocoin.com/post/656", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/708-bitcoin-divided/id290783428?i=1000371627998&mt=2", "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/01/03/bitcoin-price/5326023e2d72f987d61bbb5a22884e59d3f2562e/bitcoin-price-300.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/04/business/04DB-BITCOIN2/04DB-BITCOIN2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://reason.com/archives/2016/11/28/the-secret-dangerous-world-of"], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:06:01.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
