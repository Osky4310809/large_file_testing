However, those who partake in the illegal substance may want to chill out on the social media posts. \nAccording to a report from the Miami Herald , the U.S. Homeland Security Investigation agents used the Instagram account of Chris Brown, Future and Lil Wayne associate Harrison Garcia a.k.a. Cuban Harry a.k.a. Muhammad A Lean to bust him for his connection to numerous robberies of that purple drank from various Miami CVS and Walgreens stores. \nAlthough his current account on the social media platform is private , posts showed him driving exotic whips, posting bundles of cash, showcasing tattoos, displaying jewelry and hanging out with some pretty high-profile artists. \nThose posts on Instagram made him a target and allowed authorities to obtain a warrant for his arrest last October before he was later arrested again a few months later. In the news report, Garcia was also caught selling liquid promethazine to federal agents on video. \nTalking in front of a federal judge Monday (January 23), the 27-year-old said the Instagram posts were just to increase his followers. \n“I had an image to portray, to boost up my followers,” Garcia said. “I guess it’s just the music industry.” \nPhoto: Instagram/muhammad_a_lean \nSpeaking with the judge, he also called himself an addict of the drug. \n“I can drink a bottle in like two days. It’s easy to get. It just makes you feel sleepy,” he said. “It helps you focus. People like it in the studio because when you record your songs, it helps your voice.” \nGarcia’s trial is set for February 6 where he faces charges stemming from the robberies and racketeering.
