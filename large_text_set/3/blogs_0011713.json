A softening of the harsh reputation the unpopular club from Bermondsey have grown. But with the limelight fairly won, it was sorely abused and they received the stuffing they deserved. Son responded in the best possible way with three goals to ensure a drubbing. The first cutting in from the right-hand side - right in front of the corner of White Hart Lane holding the away fans - and curling an effort into the top left corner. Millwall's abuse had clearly not gone unnoticed by team-mate Kyle Walker who stood up from the bench and gestured angrily towards them. From Walker's seat in the dugout he perhaps had a better vantage point to fully take in what was occurring. Tottenham increased steward numbers and placed netting over seats to separate the fans Son silenced them completely early in the second half with his second of the game and the abusive chants in his direction stopped. 'We are Millwall, no-one likes us,' started up less than a minute later instead. With virtually the last kick of the game his final shot sealed the treble. The attempt was weak and too central but Millwall's goalkeeper Tom King made a hash of it and ball squirmed over the line. Millwall asked for three, and they got them all. An occasion that many feared would erupt into violence between supporters had proceeded in relative peace until the game began. There were a few skirmishes outside the stadium but a heavy police presence maintained control. Millwall fans watch on as Tottenham star Harry Kane goes down with a nasty ankle injury Spurs removed their name and logo from the advertising hoardings in front of Millwall's supporters in the upper tier to prevent a repeat of September 18 months previous when Arsenal supporters ripped them apart during a meeting. The stewards separating the home and away factions were equally as prepared in neon orange hard hats. But instead the missiles were verbal in form and dark in shade. And sadly, this is nothing new from Millwall. They directed 'DVD' chants at Wolves forward Seol Ki-Hyeon in January 2005 at The Den. The South Korean struck the winner but team-mate Paul Ince branded Millwall's supporters racist afterwards. A large police presence around White Hart Lane attempted to quell tension between the fans Police subdue a man close to Tottenham's White Hart Lane prior to the FA Cup quarter-final tie 'It was ironic that Seol should get the winner because he took stick all game,' a furious Ince said. 'The crowd were an absolute disgrace and some of the things that were said I couldn't repeat. 'I thought we'd got away from all those things and for it to happen to someone like Seol is a disgrace. 'But he responded in the right way by putting the ball in the back of the net and ramming the taunts down their throats. I'm not saying it was all the crowd, it was a small section who were giving him racial abuse. 'We've worked so hard to eradicate that from football, especially Millwall, who more than anyone are trying to get it right. To see what happened on Saturday is going back to the bad times and I wouldn't like to see it again.' Unfortunately, they were back again. Son was able to perform at his best despite racist abuse from some of the travelling fans RELATED ARTICLES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T04:18:31.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
