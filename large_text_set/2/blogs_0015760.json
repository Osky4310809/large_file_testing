The question of Britain’s exit bill and budget contributions during any interim deal would come to a head at a “gory” summit in autumn 2018, he said. \n“I think we can expect a number of them to think, if the British want a future trade deal, and some form of transitional arrangement before a future trade deal … it will come together with the money equation,” Sir Ivan said. \n“And there will be some who will want to play hardball and say, ‘Well, absent British money over a transitional period, why the hell should we give them any trade deal?” \nRogers said he expected “quite ferocious” legal disputes over the size of the UK’s exit bill and what exactly it was based on. Reports have suggested the EU will ask for a divorce settlement of up to €60bn before opening exit talks. \nBut he said it would nonetheless be disastrous for the UK to leave the EU without agreement on a trade deal. A “cliff-edge” Brexit would be “insane” and damaging economically for both the EU and Britain, he said – but could happen. \nHe said the EU had a strong incentive to reach a trade agreement, but its “legalistic” nature meant that if the prime minister stood by her “no deal is better than a bad deal” stance, the UK would be in a legal no-man’s land. \n“They will say you have transformed yourselves overnight from being a member of this body to a third country outside the body, and in the absence of a new legal agreement everything falls away,” he said. \n“They will say: the day after exit is radically different from the day before. You are now a third country and we don’t have to give you anything … And unless you have a preferential trade agreement, you can’t trade on preferential terms.” \nRogers said that while he was “not accusing anyone of anything”, there was “a danger of solipsistic thinking in London, of people sitting in their own cocoons and saying: ‘Here’s a brilliant wheeze.’” \nBritain would do well to realise that “we are up against a class act in the European commission when it comes to negotiating,” he said, with the EU’s trade directorate “one of the top two trade negotiating authorities in the world” alongside the Office of the US Trade Representative. \nThe trade deal the UK should seek would be “the biggest free trade agreement ever struck, which covers not only goods and tariffs but also services.” He said: “It would be an unprecedentedly good and bespoke deal.” \nEven so, it would not be as good as being in the single market, he said: “It is not true that you get everything you want from a free trade agreement and it’s the same as the single market. The crucial difference is between access and membership.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:08:47.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
