Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA quick-thinking bartender says they saved a young woman from a horrible situation thanks to a cunning drinks ploy. \nAs you probably know, dangerous men, unfortunate and awful as it is, have been known to spike women's drinks with 'roofies' – or Rohypnol, a drug used to treat insomnia. \nBut one bartender says they managed to stop a man from preying on a vulnerable person simply by switching drinks. They couldn't stop the guy from slipping in the drug – but made sure it was him who ended up taking it. \n“I’m a bartender, last night I saw a guy drug a girl’s drink,\" they wrote on admissions site Whisper . Rohypnol can have dangerous consequences, especially when mixed with alcohol (Photo: Getty Images) \n“When he wasn’t looking I switched the drinks. Watched the guy drug himself.” \nThe short tale was posted alongside other moments in which people claim to have prevented sexual assault. One said they witnessed a woman being taken advantage of while at a party, so called the police, and the apparent offender is still in prison to this day. \nAnother wrote that they intervened at a party when they walked into a room and saw a group of men attempting to assault a girl who'd passed out by throwing his shoes at them. \nA lot of the stories seem quite unlikely, but many are heartening, and we hope they actually happened.
