He has also been demoted .\nWillie Taggart and Oregon AD Rob Mullens' statement regarding Oderinde's suspension and the players hospitalized. pic.twitter.com/MJEiioZlML \n— Kristen Rodgers (@KristenERodgers) January 18, 2017 In a statement, head coach Willie Taggart says he’s visited with the players, whom The Oregonian reported as offensive linemen Doug Brenner and Sam Poutasi, as well as tight end Cam McCormick. Oderinde will be replaced by Jim Radcliffe, who announced just last week that he would retire after over 30 years as strength coach in Eugene.\nCoach Jim Radcliffe will take over (again) on an interim basis as Oderinde is \"suspended without pay for one month.\"\n— Kristen Rodgers (@KristenERodgers) January 18, 2017 The workouts that forced the players to be hospitalized were described as “grueling.” \nAfter the workouts at Oregon, Poutasi’s mother told The Oregonian he’d “complained of very sore arms” and received a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. That’s a dangerous syndrome that stems from muscular injury, in which muscle fibers die and their contents enter the bloodstream. It can lead to kidney failure.\nIt also cannot be ignored that these workouts come at the beginning of a new regime in Eugene under Taggart, and in the direct wake of a report last week that the end of former coach Mark Helfrich’s tenure featured players cutting corners in the weight room .\nIn the weight room during the offseason, a large number of players, and rarely the same ones, balked at completing UO's weightlifting workouts. One current Duck -- who like all players interviewed requested anonymity in exchange for their candor -- recalled teammates who finished workouts to the letter, but with much lighter weights. Another said it was common for some to mark down that they had completed all the repetitions -- even though they had not done so.\nAt the height of summer, players left the weight room barely sweating.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T05:26:13.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
