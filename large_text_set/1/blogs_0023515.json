The protests drew over one million people together in peaceful protest across the United States. The cause even flooded into foreign cities like London, Paris, and Melbourne. Women and men came together to protest against President Trump’s negative speech, actions, and threats towards women, immigrants, and minorities. Joining the masses at the Women’s March was one of our favorite Gilmore girls , Keiko Agena.\nAgena posted a photo on Instagram yesterday thanking Parent Trap actress, Elaine Hendrix “for setting up some of the LA contingent for the @womensmarch,” Agena wrote in her caption. She continued, “I am SO glad I got to be in DC for this. Thanks! (Here with my bestie Grace Jo!)”\nThank you @elaine4animals for setting up some of the LA contingent for the @womensmarch ❤You are a force! I am SO glad I got to be in DC for this. Thanks!

Instagram / Keiko Agena In fact, Lane probably would have been one of the first to sign up for the Women’s March – and would have had to trick Mrs. Kim into letting her go.\n\nBefore the Women’s March, Agena reposted an Instagram from Kulap Vilaysack about why participating in the peaceful protest is so important. “We march to change both attitudes and laws, [t]o be our all, not have it all. To plan our parenthood. We march because love is love is love is love,” part of the caption reads.\nAbsolutely, sister. Absolutely. #Repost @iamkulap with @repostapp ・・・ #repost \"We march with women past, present, and future. We march for a vote and a voice. We march because we don’t just talk about rights, we take them. We march because “we can do it!” To close the gap. For the soul of our nation. To own our bodies. We march to right the wrong. We march because we’re bossy bitches. Because, man, if you feel like a woman, you are one. Because we mean business. We march for equality: social, economic, political, and orgasmic. For tampons. For sisterhood. For immigrants (who get the job done). We march for hope, never fear. For breast pumps at work. We march because “shrill” is the sound of change. Because no means no. We march because Black Lives Matter. We march so girls can be too much. We march side by side, because empathy happens eye to eye. We march to change both attitudes and laws. To be our all, not have it all. To plan our parenthood. We march because love is love is love is love. We march to turn that broken heart into art. We march because we can, we have, and we will. We march to make herstory. Follow #Refinery29 as we head to DC and women's marches around the globe to lend our voices to hope, to change, and to our rights. Share these images in support of making it known that women's rights are human rights. We march to make herstory.
