Karen Matthews faked the kidnap of her own daughter (Photo: West Yorkshire Police/PA) \nJulie and her helpers slept all night in the community house with all the lights on to act as a beacon if the nine-year-old schoolgirl found her way home. But she never did. \nEarly the next morning her street was full of the UK’s media, catching locals in their dressing gowns. \nPolice dogs, helicopters and TV satellite trucks became part of the furniture on the estate alongside extra police to patrol the streets. \nPosters were put up, police press conferences held and Karen made a TV appeal clutching her daughter’s teddy. \nBy Day 24 there was still no news and everyone thought Shannon was dead. \nJulie, now 46, remembers: “That’s when I got a text saying, ‘That kid’s been found down Batley Carr’.” \nIt was true, Shannon was alive. \nSoon the celebrations began on the estate, with cans of lager arriving at the packed community house. \nResidents started burning the “Help find Shannon” posters, a bonfire was lit in the community house garden and a disco went on all through the night. \nBut eight years later, there is a feeling these same residents have been blamed for someone else’s crime . Karen Matthews and Julie Bushby (Photo: Phil Spencer) \nJulie explains: “It’s as if they punished us for what happened and killed our community spirit. \n“It felt like the powers that be didn’t want to know us after Shannon was found, as if they were embarrassed about us. \n\"But nobody could be more embarrassed than us — we didn’t see it coming either. \n“We sacrificed our own families for 24 days to help look for a missing child but in return the community house is now shut. \n“There’s only about a handful of the originals left on the estate. Most have moved because they don’t want to be associated with it.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:08:22.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
