The Storybook Cosmetics Quill and Ink Eyeliner set is a gorgeous throwback to the dreamiest form of writing. From the wax seals adorning Kat Von D Beauty products to the blushing hues of the ABH Modern Renaissance palette , makeup holds firm ties to romantic eras of the past .\nThe gilded quill brush features a fine tip to build the perfect poetically lined eye. The pot inky black liner features a charmed lid. We’re hoping Storybook Cosmetics is working on the perfect writing desk (or in this case a vanity) stand. The quill holder will protect the brush’s tip, and the entire set will come in tin packaging.\nStorybook Cosmetics takes packaging to a magical level! We didn't forget about our Quill and Ink eyeliner duo. We were just busy creating a stand! (It's hollow and the brush tip does not touch the sides or the bottom.) Up next, a tin box to store the set, and finalizing our formula! On track for a spring release! #storybookcosmetics \nA post shared by @storybookcosmetics on Feb 20, 2017 at 8:38pm PST \nThe set should be hitting digital shelves soon! Thank you for the feature @trendmood1 UPDATE: we are working on a stand for the quill! You asked for it and we completely agree! Hopefully we can make it work! \nA post shared by @storybookcosmetics on Jan 3, 2017 at 3:42pm PST \nThe Quill and Ink set is due for a spring release, and we could not be more excited! Storybook will probably announce a pre-sale once the packaging is finalized. We aren’t sure about an actual date or price point just yet, but this is sure to be one holy grail liner set.\nOur \"Quill & Ink\" set needed a little something else. How about a tin storage box? \nA post shared by @storybookcosmetics on Jan 2, 2017 at 7:49pm PST \nRemember, if you want to get your muggle hands on the Wizardry and Witchcraft Eyeshadow palette, it goes on pre-sale this Friday! ❤❤❤ Palette Pre-Order Feb 24, 11am CST \nA post shared by @storybookcosmetics on Feb 17, 2017 at 2:12pm PST \nWho doesn’t want to feel like a romantic poet while sweeping on eyeliner strokes? Keep an eye out for the Storybook Cosmetics Quill and Ink set this spring!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:33:26.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
