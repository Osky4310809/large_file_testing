ESPN's Josina Anderson shared Guillermo's interaction with Falcons center Alex Mack: Josina Anderson @JosinaAnderson 1/31/2017, 1:29:47 AM While the mood remained light, the focus inevitably shifted to the Super Bowl itself. Perhaps wanting to gain an early psychological edge, Falcons head coach Dan Quinn rebuffed Patriots head coach Bill Belichick 's attempted hug, per CBSSports.com's Will Brinson: Will Brinson @WillBrinson 1/31/2017, 2:23:21 AM No coach was in higher demand than Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan. He interviewed for the San Francisco 49ers' head coaching vacancy over the weekend, and CSN Bay Area's Matt Maiocco reported Shanahan had a hand in the 49ers' decision to hire John Lynch as their general manager. CBSSports.com's Jason La Canfora tweeted that Shanahan avoided directly answering whether he's leaving the Falcons but added, \"It's clear he's going to SF.\" Shanahan did, however, offer an endorsement of Lynch, per USA Today 's Tom Pelissero : \" I really believe in people, and if anyone knows John Lynch, that's a guy you should believe in.\" The Super Bowl is a new experience for many Falcons players, including starting quarterback Matt Ryan . Ryan said Monday night he sought advice from both Manning brothers in preparation for Sunday's game, according to ESPN.com's Vaughn McClure . Peyton Manning provided pointers on the buildup to the Super Bowl, while Eli Manning helped out with how to approach the Patriots in Super Bowl LI. \" I've gotten to know Eli throughout the years and he's a great guy,\" Ryan said of his conversation with the New York Giants passer, per Newsday 's Tom Rock . \" His advice was: 'You guys know yourselves and you know what you do.' At the end of the day, I think that's probably the best advice you can get, to trust what we do and trust our process, who we are and how we do things.\" Ryan crossed paths with Brady on the Opening Night stage, and the two shared a hug, which the NFL shared on Twitter: NFL @NFL 1/31/2017, 2:49:07 AM The two spoke highly of each other, according to FoxSports.com's Cameron DaSilva . Ryan said he has learned form the example Brady has set in New England, while Brady said he has admired Ryan's ability going back to his days with the Boston College Eagles. Recently, President Donald Trump signed an executive order regarding travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, the impact of which has carried over into the world of sports. The NBA announced Saturday it was seeking clarification from the State Department regarding any players from one of the seven countries listed in the order. Falcons wide receiver Mohamed Sanu is the only player of Muslim faith playing in Super Bowl LI, according to Gary Myers of the New York Daily News . He was born in New Jersey after his mother moved to the United States from Sierra Leone. Sanu said he didn't want to speak in depth on Opening Night about Trump's legislation, per Pro Football Talk's Darin Gantt : \" Very tough situation. It's really hard for me to talk about that right now. I'm not here to talk about my religious beliefs. I'm here to focus on football.\" Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett said he'd engage in his own form of personal protest toward the Trump administration should the Patriots win the Super Bowl. Bennett told reporters he'd decline the traditional invitation afforded to the Super Bowl champions, according to CSNNE.com's DJ Bean . Super Bowl festivities continue throughout the week in Houston leading up to Sunday's game, which kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET.
