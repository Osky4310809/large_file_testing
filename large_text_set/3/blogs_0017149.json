(Natalie Quinlan / CTV London) CTV London Published Sunday, March 19, 2017 3:08PM EDT Last Updated Sunday, March 19, 2017 4:25PM EDT \nA 24-year-old London man is in custody after police say he threatened to shoot people at the London Muslim Mosque. \nPolice say shortly before 2 p.m. Sunday, police were contacted by the mosque about a male who had threatened to shoot those inside the mosque. \nNumerous officers were dispatched to the mosque and police said occupants were able to keep the man outside until authorities arrived. The man was taken into custody without incident. \nPeople attending the mosque on Oxford Street West on Sunday afternoon, were upset and concerned, but did not want to comment. Mosque officials also would not comment. \nPolice say there were about 50 people inside at the time of the alleged threats. \nThere was a large police presence - more than a dozen officers - at the mosque. \nThey are unable to determine yet if this incident is hate motivated. \n“We can’t say specifically what his motive is at this point, but obviously that type of threat at this, you know, type of a location causes us great concern especially given the climate in today’s society,\" said Staff Sgt. Ryan Scrivens of the London police. \nNo firearm was seen, but the investigation is ongoing. \nCharges are pending. \nMyNews If you are on the scene of breaking news and capture it with your mobile device, share your pictures or video with MyNews.
