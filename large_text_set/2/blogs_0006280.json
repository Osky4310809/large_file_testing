For the last 12 years, I’ve mostly consumed Slow-Carb Diet options shared in The 4-Hour Body (e.g. like this low-carb, high-protein, breakfast you can make in under 3 minutes, though I now use whole eggs). \nI occasionally experiment with intermittent fasting, and the video below shares my current super-light breakfast that I use before most training and early morning travel. If hypertrophy (adding muscle) is my main objective, I still default to Slow-Carb and 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking. \nEnjoy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:51:40.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
