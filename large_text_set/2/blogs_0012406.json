Chad Johnson visits \"Extra\" at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2016. Noel Vasquez/Getty Images \nAs for which lovely ladies he hopes to see join him, Johnson tells Us , \"Too many to mention, really, based upon looks, but when it comes to contestants on these shows, you never know what they’re truly like until you’ve met them in person.\" The Weirdest ‘Bachelor’ and ‘Bachelorette’ Job Titles Ever! \nIt's unlikely that his second stint could possibly be as wild as his first. On last summer's season 3, he immediately hit it off with Lace Morris , and the pair hooked up before he was given the boot for his overly aggressive behavior. Biggest Costar Feuds and Fights Ever! \nJohnson similarly stirred up controversy on JoJo Fletcher 's season of The Bachelorette . His eyebrow-raising actions included punching a metal door and threatening to track down foe Jordan Rodgers after the show. \nWhile there is no word from the network on who else might be aiming to find a special someone on Paradise , there appear to be plenty of likely candidates on Nick Viall 's current season, including villain Corinne Olympios , who — unless she lands Viall's final rose — would seemingly be a perfect fit for the beach-based series. \nTell Us: Who else do you want to see on Bachelor in Paradise season 4? \nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. ABC has not yet announced a premiere date for Bachelor in Paradise season 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:56:43.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
