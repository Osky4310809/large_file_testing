This was disclosed in statement of the Group Genetal Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Nr. Ndu Ughamadu yesterday. This plea comes on the heels of reports that some motorists have begun panic buying of petrol, following rumours that the government is about to increase the pump price of the white product from N145 per litre. NNPC wishes to assure Nigerians that there is no iota of truth in the rumour that government is scheduled to adjust pump price of petrol. \nIndeed, with the resumption of production by the Corporation’s three refineries in Kaduna, Port Harcourt and Warri, complemented by imports, there is enough stock of PMS, Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), diesel and kerosene. \nThis much was explained yesterday by NNPC Chief Operating Officer of the Refineries, Mr Anibor Kragha while briefing the Senate Committee on Petroleum Downstream in a presentation on the current status of the refineries at the National Assembly Complex in Abuja. \nIn the presentation, Kragha told the legislators that the nation’s three refineries produced additional volumes of 4.6 million litres of kerosene and 7.7 million litres of diesel, in addition to millions of litres of petrol being refined daily at the nation’s refineries. \nThe assurances of availability of stock by the NNPC Chief Operation Officer of the Refineries yesterday still stand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T14:19:32.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
