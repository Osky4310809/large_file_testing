He’s come in here and done so much for us as a player. And he only wants to be respected like any other player.\n“And I understand Shaq works for a company that wants him to do that type of stuff and make fun of players. And it’s cool and funny, but when you just keep doing it time and time and time again for no reason, and then a guy actually disagrees you and you threaten him … I didn’t know cops could threaten civilians like that. So it’s definitely childish. But that’s what they want from these stars and these retired players — to feud with the guys that’s playing now and to make arguments and disagreements. But if I was JaVale, I’d feel the same way. It’s childish.”\nShaq saw Durant’s comments and told KD to mind his business.\n\n@KDTrey5 mind yo business this ain't for you,\n— SHAQ (@SHAQ) February 24, 2017 \n\nShaq went on to say that he was going to finish what Javale stated. \n@KDTrey5 I understand u sticking up for your teammate that's cool but your boy @JaValeMcGee34 is still a bum, he started it I'm a finish it\n— SHAQ (@SHAQ) February 24, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:20:06.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
