He said the card had Emma Stone's name on it, making him think that La La Land was the winner.\nNeil Patrick Harris took to Twitter to post a photo of the envelope Beatty had opened, which read \"Best Actress In A Leading Role,\" instead of \"Best Picture.\"\n\n\"Warren Beatty seems to be opening an envelope that says 'Actress in a Leading Role,'\" Neil tweeted. \"He must have been handed the wrong one somehow. Yikes.\"\nStone had just won the Best Actress award moments before the incident. Some viewers noticed that Leo, who presented the award to Emma, walked off stage with the red card under his arm.\nThis lead to several conspiracy theories among social media users suggesting that Leo may have had something to do with the mix up.\n\"Figured it out.... it was #LeonardoDiCaprio the whole time.... #Oscars #LaLaLand #Moonlight#WhatDidYouDoWithTheEnvelope?\" wrote Twitter user RobbyDee.\n\n\"Leo put the card back in the envelope. Left the stage with it. He must've given it to a producer who accidentally gave it to Beatty #Oscars,\" tweeted Josh Billinson.\n\n\"Leo masterminded this whole thing. After winning last year, he still yearned for revenge for years of embarrassment,\" Billison continued. \"I've watched every clip I can find on Twitter, and Leo never gives Emma Stone the envelope. This whole thing has to be his fault\"\nEmma said she had the card the entire time while speaking with the press in the winner's room.\n\"I also was holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card that entire time, so whatever story… I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card,\" she said. \"So, I’m not sure that happened.\"\nHowever, PwC, the company that handles the award announcements and individual cards, has two sets of cards for every award. The company issued a statement apologizing for the blunder:\nWe sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture.\nThe presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.\nWe appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation.\n\"It was an amazing thing to hear La La Land,\" Emma Stone added. \"I think we all would have loved to win Best Picture. But we are SO excited for Moonlight.\n\"I think it’s one of the best films of all time… But again, God I love Moonlight. I’m so excited. So I think it’s an incredible outcome, but a very strange happening for Oscar history.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:52:00.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
