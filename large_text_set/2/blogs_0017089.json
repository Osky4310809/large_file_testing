Even the dancers should have stopped dancing and helped me off the f--king stage.\" \"I'm sorry. It was a mess, and I blame everybody, and I blame myself for not leaving after rehearsal,\" she added. Carey made headlines after the glitch-filled performance during Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve With Ryan Seacrest. The mother of two's technical difficulty-ridden performance -- which exposed that she wasn't singing live and left her stranded on stage -- created a saga of pointed fingers, with Carey's manager, Stella Bulochnikov, slamming Dick Clark Productions for \"sabotaging\" the singer. The production company later called the remarks \"defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.\" \"It's just something where if I can't explain it to the entire world, then they're not going to understand it, because it's not what they do,\" Carey explained to Rolling Stone of her defective earpiece. \"Just like I wouldn't understand somebody who had a desk job and how to do that. I couldn't. I literally am incapable of being in the real world and surviving.\" WATCH: Mariah Carey Slams NYE Production Team Who ‘Foiled’ Her, Announces Break From Social Media Mimi has since redeemed herself with a glitch-free performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live last week, where she sang her new single, \"I Don't,\" which was inspired by her breakup with her ex-fiancé, billionaire James Packer. The \"Touch My Body\" singer's new relationship with her backup dancer, Bryan Tanaka, was heavily featured on her E! docuseries, Mariah's World (alongside her breakup), though Carey clearly has no regrets about letting her relationship drama play out on TV. \"I don't think we're being public in a way that my relationships have been public before,\" she said. \"I really don't. To me, the best thing of this is to keep it a little more private. But I'm not going to not go places with him and enjoy our lives because everybody thinks, 'Oh, it's too soon!' kind of thing. We all saw the freakin' show. This is not a surprise.\" RELATED: Mariah Carey Calls Bryan Tanaka Her Boyfriend For the First Time, Talks Bringing Kids on Tour Carey will next be hitting the road, taking her 5-year-old twins, Moroccan and Monroe, along on her All the Hits Tour with Lionel Richie.
