They face Liverpool in the EFL Cup semi finals at home. Jack Stephens looks dejected after the defeat to Everton earlier this month (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nYou might expect for Jurgen Klopp to be a bit apprehensive. Liverpool have just fudged a cup tie, and Mane is on international duty. You might expect a rousing atmosphere in that first leg. It’s a semi final and Wembley is the prize! \nYou might have got it as well. If it was at the Dell. \nNot at St Mary’s. Southampton have already shown that twice this season in the Europa League. \nI was astonished by the quietness of the occasion against Inter Milan. It’s Inter Milan! Three European Cups, 18 Series A titles, the team of Zanetti, Figo, Vieri, Bergomi and Ibrahimovic.

Southampton had a chance to qualify and they were tactically outmanoeuvred by the Israeli Champions. It was a game of chess, played in an atmosphere to match. \nFrom the botched PA that couldn’t whip up a bowl of cream, to the ridiculous team selections that put Claude Puel and his side in a position where it went to the last game. It was a mess and it was a wasted opportunity. \nSaints fans won’t like me saying it, but when Portsmouth played AC Milan in the same competition, everyone knew about it. I doubt anyone knows how dramatic Southampton’s exit was. \nSouthampton are a “good” club. They develop a regular amount of exciting, British youngsters and they play possession based football. Nathan Redmond looks down in the dumps after their Europa League exit (Photo: Michael Steele) \nIt’s not like the days of Le Tissier, Benali and Mark Dennis though. There was devilry and magic then. Whenever I go at Southampton now it feels like a place where everyone wants to be somewhere else. \nThe owner wants to sell. The manager’s never last long. The captain wants to leave. The best central defender is happy to whack on a Manchester City shirt. For every true supporter in the crowd, there appears to be someone else they have dragged along who spends most of the night on Instagram. \nI think it’s incredible a club of that size has already thrown away the gift of European football this season, and no one seemed to care. \nIs this what is acceptable there? Will it be ok just that Southampton have reached a semi final of a domestic trophy rather than achieve something they have only ever managed once in their history, and win one? Koeman is eyeing a reunion with Southampton's Virgil van Dijk (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nWill it feel like another successful season, if they just about qualify for Europe or not, but have wads in the bank from the sale of Virgil Van Dijk ? Surely the fans can’t be having that. \nIts easy, when the praise for developing a battery of talent is flowing, and the money from yet another big money transfer is rolling in, to forget what your primary job is. \nIt’s to win football matches and trophies, and break new ground. It’s about ambition, and Southampton don't have ambition, and they don’t win trophies. \nThey have to change that, and this is their chance. Otherwise, everyone else, just like Ronald Koeman, will give up and leave. poll loading Was Ronald Koeman right to quit Southampton for Everton? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T13:06:04.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
