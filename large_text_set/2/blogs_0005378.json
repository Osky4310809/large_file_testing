NDF/davaotoday.com \nMANILA, Philippines â€” The National Democratic Front (NDF), the political arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), condemned the arrest of its consultant and of a liaison officer of the New People's Army (NPA) in Davao City. \nNDF consultant Arnel Arbitrario and NPA liaison officer Roderick Mamuyac were arrested on Monday following the resumption of government offensives against the communist armed group. \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has lifted the unilateral ceasefire and has ordered the Philippine National Police to arrest members of the CPP-NPA-NDF, including those involved in peace talks with the government. \nThe lifting of the government ceasefire came days after the NPA announced it was ending its own ceasefire with the government. The NPA said the Duterte administration had failed to release some 400 political prisoners that they said the president promised to do. The NPA also said security forces had occupied areas within communist control despite the ceasefire. \nThe NDF called on the government to immediately release Arbitrario and his companions, stressing that he is immune from arrest as covered by the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG). Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \n\"We must remind the [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] that the peace negotiations are ongoing. Under the terms of the GRP-NDFP JASIG, the GRP is obliged to send the NDFP a written notice of termination that would take effect only 30 days after our receipt of such notice,\" NDF Negotiating Panel chair Fidel Agcaoili said in a statement. \nIssues over the JASIG led to a breakdown of talks between the Aquini administration and the CPP-NPA-NDF in 2013. \nAgcaoili noted that Arbitrario's release last August was secured by bail and that his arrest violates the government's own rules and procedures. \nArbitratio is a publicly-known consultant in the peace talks between the government and the communist group. \nThe NDF called the government out for the escalation of attacks, which it said undermine the efforts by both parties for the peace talks. \n\"The escalation of attacks against the formal aspect of the peace negotiations, including their participants, goes against current efforts to maintain the schedules related to the next round of informal and formal talks in February and April 2017 and the momentum to accelerate the peace negotiations and arrive at agreements that would pave the way for social, economic and political reforms towards a just and lasting peace for the Filipino people and the country,\" Agcaoili said. \nThe communist group earlier stressed that political consultants temporarily released cannot be arrested again on the mere order of the president. \nThe NDF said that the 17 consultants released in 2016 to join the peace talks are currently in the country and are set to post bail again this month.
