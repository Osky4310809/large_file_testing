We’ll let @wernerc33 take it from here: \nThis gallery is a collection of pictures from the first few months of our son Jackson’s life. Jackson was born at Naval Hospital in Okinawa, Japan. I am a Marine and was stationed at MCAS Futenma and my wife is a nurse at the Naval Hospital. Jackson was born with a rare heart defect known as Transposition of the Great Arteries. Transposition is a heart defect where the pulmonary and aorta are switched and in the wrong position. This keeps oxygenated blood from getting to the rest of the body; it was only going between his heart and lungs. When he was only a day old we were told he had this heart defect. \nImmediately the Navy and Air Force doctors and nurses began planning his MEDEVAC mission to get him to San Diego so he could have life saving surgery. 2 \nThis was Jackson the day he was born. The doctors didn’t know what was wrong but they could tell right away something wasn’t right with his breathing. Immediately after he was born they took him to the NICU and began testing to see if he had Respiratory Distress Syndrome or an infection. They did an Echocardiogram on his heart and sent the results to the closest pediatric cardiologist for review…..that cardiologist was in Hawaii. Luckily for us (because of the time difference), the cardiologist there looked at the results immediately and called back to our doctor to tell him the news. It was tough to hear our doctor tell us that our son needed surgery as soon as possible and that he needed to be sent on a plane across the world. I immediately went home and packed up four suitcases as quickly as I could (with the help of some amazing friends) and rushed back to the hospital. I then filled out passport paperwork with a gentleman from the US Consulate and right then and there he handed me a passport for our son. The next morning we began our journey. 3 \nThis was what we flew on, our own private KC-135! The flight crew was amazing and we couldn’t be more thankful for them getting us to San Diego and saving Jackson’s life. 4 \nFor non-military Chivers, the KC-135 Stratotanker is traditionally used for refueling other aircraft while in-flight. 5 \nJackson was transported in an incubator accompanied by numerous medications while incubated and sedated.

The team consisted of one Air Force Doctor, one Air Force Nurse, and one Navy Nurse who is actually a friend of my wife. They worked together at Balboa Naval Hospital a few years back and my wife worked with him again during our time in Okinawa. 10 \nThey did amazing things on the flight to keep Jackson as stable as possible. For me and my wife, this was the longest 11 hours of our lives. Advertisement Advertisement 11 \nThis picture was taken right after we landed at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego. My wife was still a patient herself, so she had to go to Balboa Naval Hospital. I traveled with Jackson to Rady Children’s Hospital. This was my wife saying goodbye to him, she didn’t get to see him for another three days while she recovered at Balboa. 12 \nThis was us on the K Loader getting off the KC-135. Even then, the dedication of the NICU team was amazing. They kept looking after his vitals and got us off that plane in no time. 13 \nAs soon as we arrived at Rady Children’s, the NICU flight team and the team at Radys did a turnover. Once they finished their high five, the team at Radys immediately took him to the cath lab to do an atrial septostomy. This procedure was done to help stabilize him, he wasn’t doing so hot after the 11 hour flight flying at 35k feet. This procedure created a hole in his heart to help the mixing of oxygenated blood and unoxygenated blood. This was vital in helping him gain enough strength to endure the open heart surgery that would eventually fix his heart. 14 15 \nThis was the morning of his big surgery. We went in to see him and gave him a pep talk. Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:41:06.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
