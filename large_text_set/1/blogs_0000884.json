However, with a few exceptions (like Armageddon and the Pirates of the Caribbean films), he’s mostly stayed away from science fiction and fantasy. Now, he’s teaming up with one of his Pirates directors on a scifi film called Origin . Advertisement \nDeadline reports that Bruckheimer and the co-director of the upcoming fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film, Joachim Rønning, just sold the pitch to Paramount. What’s Origin about? Like most high-priced science fiction ideas, they’re keeping the story under wraps. Only that it’s “a contemporary big-scale high concept science fiction premise with franchise potential.” Of course it is. \nMore than Rønning being involved (in addition to directing, he’ll also write the script with his brother, Andreas Rønning), it’s Bruckheimer doing a new genre film that has us most intrigued here. Bruckheimer doing anything, frankly, is noteworthy, and if his latest project happens to involve space, technology, science, robots, and all the other stuff we love, that’s even better.
