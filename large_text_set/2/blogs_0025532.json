HDD has published first-week projections for HNDRXX : the album is expected to move between 110K and 125K units . \nFuture faces competition from John Mayer and country group Little Big Town, but HNDRXX is still projected to go #1 by a comfortable margin. If this projection holds up, Future would become the first artist in history to earn two #1 album debuts in consecutive weeks. It would be his fifth straight #1 album.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:36:33.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
