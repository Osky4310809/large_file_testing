On Sunday afternoon, Dennis Graham hit up Instagram with the artwork for his son’s highly anticipated More Life project . And he chose to caption the image with “Tonight’s the night,” leading many people to believe the playlist would drop before the end of the day. However, if you kept reading the caption—after a series of tags and emoji—it became clear Graham was not talking about More Life . He was talking about his upcoming show. “I will be performing at Delilah,” the caption read at the end. We’re sure many Drizzy followers were devastated by this stunt, but you have to admit it was a great way to generate publicity.
