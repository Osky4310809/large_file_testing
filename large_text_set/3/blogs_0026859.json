It’s no secret that we love Sia and her music. Now, we think Sia’s new song for Sesame Street should be rated “S” for “Super Catchy”! We learned about the new jam, “S is for Songs,” from Uproxx, and it’s ~still~ in our heads. In a second, you’ll see why. Of course, Sia’s songs are always in our heads since she seems to be on the radio all the time . We don’t mind, of course.\nBut Sia and Sesame Street ?! How did this come to be? Actually, it seems to be coming at the perfect time. As you probably know, President Donald Trump wants to defund federal funding to organizations like PBS. So Sia singing with muppets? Yes, please. And , we can SEE SIA’S FACE!\nYou can watch the music video here. How adorable was that, right?! And the muppets in Sia wigs?! WAY TOO CUTE! Okay, feel free to keep humming and singing along as you keep reading. We also found a few behind-the-scenes photos of when Sia hung with the lovable muppets.\nHere’s Sia and none other than the Cookie Monster. Aww. When your hair is perfect for play time. #SesameTakesLA \nA post shared by Sesame Street (@sesamestreet) on Mar 2, 2016 at 1:44pm PST \nAnd here’s Elmo and Abby Cadabby. Again, the wigs! Super adorbs! Elmo and Abby Cadabby are ready to meet @siathisisacting! Welcome to Day 2 of #SesameTakesLA! \nA post shared by Sesame Street (@sesamestreet) on Mar 2, 2016 at 11:39am PST \nYes, “S” IS for songs. But, like we said before, “S” is also for “Super Catchy.” We’ll also add a few more to the list, like “S” is for “Super Fabulous” and “S” is for “Sia’s the Best!” We could go on and on… But, rn, we have to go watch that video again!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:13:26.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
