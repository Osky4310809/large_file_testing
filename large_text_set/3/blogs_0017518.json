George stopped by the Sunrise Senior Living Facility to wish one of the residents, Pat Adams, a happy 87th birthday. By the looks of the photo that Sunrise shared on Twitter on Monday, Pat was not only surprised but absolutely delighted by the gesture. \nAccording to People , the facility is near the home that George shares with his wife Amal . \"The lady in the picture loves George Clooney and mentions every day how she would love him to meet him, especially as he lives so near to where I work,\" staff member Linda Jones posted to her Facebook page . \"So letters have been sent asking would it be possible for her dream to come true. He brought a card and a lovely bunch of flowers\" The staff member explained that the Money Monster star popped by during her shift and that she was in \"utter shock\" when she answered the door to find him behind it. \"He bought a card and a lovely bunch of flowers. [It] seems hard to believe now that he actually came in,\" she said. \nGeorge's sweet deed is similar to one made by fellow Hollywood veteran Denzel Washington, who paid a visit to his childhood librarian, Connie Mauro , on her 99th birthday.
