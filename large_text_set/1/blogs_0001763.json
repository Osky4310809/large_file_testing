Despite the Liberal government’s vow of openness and transparency, the department declined to name the winning bid, citing reasons of commercial confidentiality.\nBut multiple industry sources say Thales Canada and was told in late December it had won the $5.2-billion project.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan HMCS St. John's, one of Canada's Halifax-class frigates, undergoes a mid-life refit at the Irving Shipbuilding facility in Halifax on Thursday, July 3, 2014. The deal would see the firm provide in-service support for an initial period of eight years, with options to extend services up to 35 years. Bujold said the actual contract is expected to be awarded in the fall of 2017. “If the parties cannot reach an agreement on the financial aspects of the contract within an allocated 45 calendar days, the GoC will invite the next highest ranked bidder to enter into negotiation,” he added.\nThe first Arctic Offshore Patrol Ship is being built by Irving on the east coast and is expected in 2018. Construction has yet to start on the two new Joint Support Ships. The first of those supply ships, to be built by Seaspan in Vancouver, is expected in 2021.\nThales Canada did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Canadian government announced in July it was seeking bids from companies to repair and maintain the two new fleets over a 35-year period.\nRelated Galleys to be redesigned on Coast Guard patrol ships to allow crews to cook safely on board Danish warship’s visit to Halifax cancelled because it would put Canada in a ‘delicate’ situation Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver sent to help relief efforts in New Zealand town devastated by earthquake But some Department of National Defence officials warned the government years ago that selecting one company for a single in-service support (ISS) contract covering two types of ships could give one firm too much control and end up being more costly. “A single ISS provider may assume a ‘take it or leave it’ attitude at the time of contract option renewal, forcing prices up,” warned an April 2012 DND briefing note for then-deputy minister Robert Fonberg.\nA dispute with the contractor could also force the Royal Canadian Navy to resort to conducting maintenance and support for the ships on a piecemeal basis, a development that would affect its operations, added the briefing obtained by the Citizen.\nDND also warned that not all companies would be happy with such a strategy as it would take a significant amount of business out of competition for a long time. Other DND officials, however, argued that the single contract strategy would work and any risks could be handled by increasing the level of oversight on the deal.\nAdrian Wyld / CP Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote speak about a review of Canada Post during a news conference in Ottawa, Thursday, May 5, 2016. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld ORG XMIT: ajw102 Last year, the government said the competition to pick one firm to provide in-service support, including refit, repair and maintenance and training for the two fleets, would benefit Canadian industry and the public. “By combining the Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships and Joint Support Ships In-Service Support into one contract, we ensure the effective maintenance and support of these fleets over their operational lives,” Judy Foote, the Minister of Public Services and Procurement, said at the time.\nThe federal government also noted, “that combining the contracts for the AOPS and JSS In-Service Support under a single contractor will benefit industry by increasing workforce stability and benefit Canadians by reducing costs through economies of scale.”\nIndustry sources say there is no need for the intense secrecy about Thales being the top bidder since the news has circulated over the last couple of weeks among various companies. They warn that there is a growing pattern of secrecy over defence purchases at Public Services and Procurement Canada.\n• Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:43:45.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
