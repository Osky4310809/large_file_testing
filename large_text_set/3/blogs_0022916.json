She absolutely loves them!” \nThe Facebook page Love What Matters posted a video of the adorable promposal happening and noted how Shaedon said, \nKnowing her for seven years now, she’s brought nothing but joy to my life. Anyone who’s ever around her, she makes them laugh, she always has a smile on her face. She’s amazing. \nNeedless to say, the video of Carlie’s reaction to the cheesy invitation is priceless: These Two Are ADORABLE! \nShaedon asked Carlie to prom in an especially cheesy way; featuring a Doritos ensemble. But it's his heart and their friendship exploding hearts around the world. Carlie is a beautiful girl who is the little sister of Shaedon's best friend; she also has down syndrome. Shaedon noted, \"Knowing her for seven years now, she's brought nothing but joy to my life. Anyone who's ever around her, she makes them laugh, she always has a smile on her face. She's amazing,\" Shaedon's shirt reads:\"I know I'm NACHO typical Dorito, but…\"Back: \"… I'm going to be CHEESY and ask: WILL YOU GO TO PROM WITH ME?\" How amazing are these two?

The video has now gained over 137,000 likes on Facebook and over 54,000 shares. Shaedon continued, “It has been a very neat and exciting experience.” Facebook \nThe couple is set to attend prom on April 22, and Shaedon wants to make the night as special as possible. \nHe explained, \nShe says she wants to be a princess like Cinderella and it would mean everything to make her feel that way. The Whitmans are basically my second family and have been so kind and nurturing to me. My main goal is to make Carlie’s prom as special as possible. \nSo far, so good, Shaedon.
