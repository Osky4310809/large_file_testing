This is your chance to torpedo Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation, so make it count. \nLet’s check in on Tricky Dick’s performance: #Gorsuch asked about letter by student accusing him of encouraging discrimination against pregnant female lawyers https://t.co/yKRbDMW3i2 pic.twitter.com/kf0kdO1mFD \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) March 21, 2017 Holy crap. This is just a wipe out. Look at Durbin being a jackass, and the way Gorsuch handles it with this answer. https://t.co/sZJAoGWpbw \n— Mike Dury (@MikeDury) March 21, 2017 \nMan. Durbin is really not good at this. Actually, he doesn’t seem to be good at anything today. That’s bad news for him … but great news for viewers. I think Durbin's trying to break Gorsuch but it's not happening. #GorsuchHearing \n— Jess Clackum (@JessicaClackum) March 21, 2017 Wow, did #gorsuch just demolish durbin in that exchange about the law school incident… \n— Jeffrey Toobin (@JeffreyToobin) March 21, 2017 In response to Durbin, #Gorsuch just gave one of the most erudite and detailed defense of Hobby Lobby ever offered. #GorsuchHearing \n— Nate Madden (@NateMaddenCR) March 21, 2017 Shorter Durbin: judges should fix laws if Congress screws the up. Judge Gorsuch: don't screw it up in the first place. #GorsuchHearing \n— Dan Isett (@DanIsett) March 21, 2017 Gorsuch, responding to Durbin's Univ. of Colorado question: pic.twitter.com/IDBhcCh04b \n— Dave Mitchell (@the4thdave) March 21, 2017 Gorsuch to Durbin. pic.twitter.com/DEe9hRkzLO \n— Heather Champion (@winningatmylife) March 21, 2017 Gorsuch v.
