I'm not going to get into that war. \n\"There are times when you think about one thing, you can say another and between us, once we come here, we talk about football. We do not give it much more thought.\" \nAfter hosting Israel at El Molinon, Spain travel to France for a friendly – returning to the country where Vicente del Bosque's decorated reign came to an end. \nDefeat in the last-16 of Euro 2016 to Italy paved the way for Lopetegui to take over and Busquets is enjoying life under the former Porto boss. \n\"It's the same idea with the same system. Maybe Lopetegui wants to keep the team closer together, with more pressure, but I think it's pretty similar,\" he added. \nFive things we didn't learn from England \n\"With Vicente we achieve a lot, although in the end there was the bitter taste of the last World Cup and Euro 2016. \n\"We have to look to the future and we are very excited about Lopetegui, with what has been seen in these first matches, and we are immersed in a qualifying group that will not be easy.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:34:14.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
