The iPhone 8 could also boast an embedded Touch ID sensor later this year as well. There are a variety of rumors to sift through, but over at ConceptsiPhone , they’ve put together a nice look at some pretty crazy, albeit awesome, ideas for what Apple could launch this year. \nThe concept video for the iPhone 8, which is called “iPhone 8 Commercial,” shows a handset that features a rounded, metallic frame, and an all-glass design .
