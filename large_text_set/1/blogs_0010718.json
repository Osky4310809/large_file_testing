Mrs. Clinton was accompanied by her husband, Bill Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea. \nHypocrites. Why doesn’t the audience blame her for Trump’s election? Trending 'TV is muted': CBS NFL analyst Phil Simms ripped by fans for 'insufferable' commentary \nBill Clinton was there, too, and reportedly sang along with the cast: Bill Clinton animatedly singing final song of the day here at The Color Purple. Seems to know the words. \n— Michael Barbaro (@mikiebarb) January 8, 2017 \nWell at least these two seem happy with their retirement… \n***", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:52:13.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
