We’re going to give these schools the tools they need to succeed — plain and simple,” the mayor said to applause in November 2014.\nBut in a bitter irony, Coalition School staffers, students and parents say the mayor’s promise has proved empty as the third year of his “School Renewal Program” draws to a close.\nThe high school’s classrooms are starved for supplies and qualified teachers, with unlicensed interns leading one class and the kids in others left to learn from videos, sources said.\nMeanwhile, the dean who dealt with discipline problems was replaced with a “business manager” described by staffers as a close friend of the school’s new principal, Geralda Valcin, who arrived in March 2016.\nValcin also redecorated her own office and on Thursday treated about 100 faculty members, “on track” students and their parents to a gala dinner and awards ceremony at the New Yorker hotel, staffers said.\nMost disturbing, however, are claims that Coalition teachers are being pressured to pass students to boost the graduation rate.\n“The message is clear that if the percentages are not high enough, then teachers are going to be held accountable,” one staffer said. “The students know they can pass the class even if they’re not doing anything.”\nAnother staffer was even more candid.\n“Teachers are told: ‘You must pass this student and this student,’” the source said.\nA former Coalition School student who lives in a nearby housing project described another way Valcin has improved the school’s statistics. The 18-year-old, who admitted struggling with chronic lateness due to family problems, said Valcin forced him to withdraw and attend a dropout-prevention “transfer school,” along with about a half-dozen classmates she confronted on the first day of school last year.\nSEE ALSO \nGoing to a de Blasio 'Renewal school' didn't prep me for college 0:0 For this aspiring doctor, attending one of Mayor de Blasio’s... “She told us to our faces, ‘You need to leave, you’re not good for this school, you’re bringing kids down,’” the student recalled. “I felt very hurt. She did anything in her power to get kids who she said were like me out.”\nStaffers said Valcin has refused requests to buy new textbooks, even though there aren’t enough to go around and the ones that are available are nearly 10 years told.\nValcin also rations the school’s supply of paper, giving each teacher 5,000 sheets and saying they have to last four months, staffers said.\nMany teachers hand out that much paper to their low-income students in just one month, forcing them to buy more with their own money, with one teacher spending $200, staffers said.\n“Last year, the principal ordered more than enough paper. There’s a pile of boxes of paper, but we’re not allowed to touch it,” one source said.\n“Even the custodian is saying, ‘Why are you buying paper?’”\nThe 11th grade Global History and Geography class was led by a teacher who spent the days “reading a newspaper” until a replacement arrived in December, parent Ana Lorenzi said.\n“There were no lessons given. The students would either just read books on their own, or my son said they put videos on for them to see that weren’t related to Global Studies,” she fumed.\n“It was a waste of time. What little they were giving them wasn’t going to be enough to prepare them for the Regents exam in January….Those months were very important for the kids to be studying for that test.”\nThe school also has two Spanish classes, but that teacher left in the fall and hasn’t been replaced, sources said.\nOne class is being supervised by a math teacher who can’t speak Spanish, with a 15-year-old student saying that “the principal is making us take an online course to make up for not having a teacher.”\nShe told us to our faces, ‘You need to leave, you’re not good for this school, you’re bringing kids down…she did anything in her power to get kids who she said were like me out.\n“It’s more like worksheets and YouTube videos that basically show us how to conjugate Spanish verbs,” said the student, who added that the kids’ papers get collected by the math teacher and graded by Valcin.\nFor the other class, Valcin “decided to take a couple of the interns” from the nonprofit Partnership with Children that provides social services to the school and assigned them to teach the kids.\n“They’re not licensed teachers. No licensed person is in the room with those kids,” the source added.\nThe school also has a swimming pool, but it’s closed, staffers said.\nThe shocking shortage of resources hasn’t been addressed by any of the school’s outside supervisors who are part of the massive bureaucracy built up by the Department of Education as part of the Renewal program, which is costing taxpayers $186.5 million this year, staffers said.\n“They’re going around in the classrooms visiting classrooms once a month, two times or four times a month — and most of the time it’s not only the superintendent. There’s always a bunch of people,” one source said.\nWhen it comes to her own comfort, however, Valcin somehow managed to spruce up her office over the summer, staffers said.\n“She came in and threw out all the functioning furniture, and now everything is color-coordinated — from her office out to the main office,” one source said.\nA DOE spokeswoman insisted that “all teachers at Coalition … have appropriate certification,” adding that Valcin “has hired additional staff and purchased 60 new computers to support the school’s STEM [science, technology, engineering and math] focus.”\nValcin declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:09:09.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
