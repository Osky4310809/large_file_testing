It could be about the cooperation between the US and Russia, that we think is going to be positive for the rest of the world, including Syria.” ‘EU supporting terrorists in Syria from very beginning’ \nAssad blasted the European Union for supporting extremists in Syria “since the very beginning,” saying that it can’t “destroy and build at the same time” in the war-torn country. \n“The EU is supporting the terrorists in Syria from the very beginning under different titles: humanitarians, moderate, and so on.” Communiqué of President Assad statement to Belgian media https://t.co/Vp8fM1SJo6 pic.twitter.com/l91fMcncQs — Hassan Ridha (@sayed_ridha) February 7, 2017 \n\nHe provided the examples of the terrorist groups Al-Nusra Front (now known as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham) and Islamic State, which have always been extremist but still were supported by the EU “from the very beginning.” \n“If you ask any Syrian the same question, he will tell you, ‘No, we don’t accept [EU involvement], those countries supported the people who destroyed our country, we don’t want them to be here.’ That’s what I think.” \nAccording to Assad, many in Syria believe that “the Europeans don’t exist politically, they only follow the master, which is the Americans.” \n“So, the question should be about the Americans, and the Europeans will follow and will implement what the Americans want. They don’t exist as independent states…,” he said. ‘UN biased because of American, French & British influence’ \nThe Syrian leader also criticized United Nations institutions, which he said are far from being unbiased “because of the American influence and the French and British, mainly.” \n“Most of those institutions …don’t work to bring the stability to the world or to look for the truth; they are only politicized to implement the agenda of those countries.” Safe zones in Syria are waste of time as they ‘won’t be safe enough’, UN refugee chief says https://t.co/ZY6Y9Q6G21", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:54:56.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
