What is bootloader \nLet’s start from the beginning. The bootloader is a program that starts whenever a device is powered on to activate the right operating system. It is therefore not only a trait reserved to Android, but also one that can be find out all devices with an operating, be it a smartphone, a tablet, a PC etc. \nIt may occur that a device, a computer for example, may be equipped with two different operating systems (dual boot). In this case, either one or the other bootloader starts, depending on the user's preference or what has been pre-programmed to happen automatically. \nThe same principle also applies to Android devices, except that there is only one operating system in this case.

When you want to modify your own device, one of the biggest obstacles is the locked bootloader. What is involved? \nA locked bootloader will only load the authorized operating systems with a digital signature. Almost every smartphone manufacturer decides to lock it by only allowing its own personalized Android to load, preventing the installation of other custom ROMs. But as you know, behind every Android problem, there is always a solution. To be able to run a custom ROMs, you first need to unlock the bootloader, which allows you to start the “unauthorized” operating system. \nThe method to unlock bootloaders varies per manufacturer who provide different procedures, from sending a simple command from the PC via the USB connection, to download a specific program.
