Its themes of strength and speaking up, and the riveting performance in a clip on Facebook, has drawn quite an audience online.\nSEE ALSO: Seth Meyers masterfully skewers Trump's 'alternative facts' in his 'Closer Look'\nA flash mob organized by MILCK and dressed largely in pink 'pussyhats' sang the spirited rallying cry of a song during the event, bringing together a capella singers from all over the U.S., NPR reports.\nA short clip of the performance was captured by Israeli director Alma Har'el and posted to Facebook, gaining more than 13 million views by Tuesday afternoon.\nThe song's catchy, defiant chorus — \"I can’t keep quiet, no oh oh oh oh oh oh\" — seemed to resonate with many of the millions who marched after Trump's inauguration, as did its strong message of empowerment.\nPut on your face\nKnow your place\nShut up and smile\nDon’t spread your legs\nI could do that\nBut no one knows me\nNo one ever will\nIf I don’t say something\nIf I just lie still\nWould I be that monster\nScare them all away\nIf I let them hear what I have to say\nAlong with the song, the #ICantKeepQuiet hashtag was launched by MILCK, who tweeted messages with the hashtag in the days leading up to the march.\nI'm in support of the women's march because I believe in respectful language in media towards women. #ICANTKEEPQUIET post your own vrsn! pic.twitter.com/Yx4nBqhN9y\n— MILCK (@MILCKMUSIC) January 15, 2017\nAfter the video went viral, the song seemed to evolve into a full-blown anthem — one MILCK has said is meant to inspire and unite in the midst of oppression.\n\"With this song, I feel like I’m finally allowing my truest inner self to be expressed,\" she told Indie Minded just days before the march. \"In this time of fear, propaganda and discrimination, it is critical for our individual and collective voices to be heard.\"\n\"In this time of fear, propaganda and discrimination, it is critical for our individual and collective voices to be heard.\"\n\"With this song I’m saying I am NOT the woman who is going to stay quiet where there are figures who promote oppression,\" she added. \"I want to encourage others to give a voice to whatever they may have silenced, political or personal.\"\nShe said she produced a music video with Director Sammi Cohen in the days following the election, as she grappled with finding the right material to bring it to life.\n\"I wanted the video to be raw and pure, focused on the emotions that spur from being silenced,\" she said. \"I know that many people, beyond just women, know that feeling of suffocation that comes with oppression.”\nSince the song first made waves, the #ICantStayQuiet hashtag has become a hub for people speaking out on a variety of concerns, from dealing with women's rights to the other social issues in Trump's America.\nNo one knows me-\nNo one ever will\nIf I don't say something,\nTake that dry blue pill ♀ #icantkeepquiet\n— Nancy Ⓥ (@slasherbarbie) January 24, 2017\nI am feminist because I know what it's like to be sexually assaulted and then belittled by the investigator. #icantkeepquiet #onewomanriot\n— Candy Mikeska (@mrsmikeska) January 24, 2017\n@realDonaldTrump unless u can show real proof stop saying 3-5 million illegal votes.
