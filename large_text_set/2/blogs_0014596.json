This is to ensure that I can have a smooth passage inside”, said Isatou Dibba, a Barrow supporter. \nUS and British diplomats were finding it difficult to enter the stadium, an AFP correspondent reported, as people who had not been able to get inside massed against a heavy security presence. \nBarrow will retake the oath of office he first made at the Gambian embassy in Senegal, whose territory almost entirely surrounds The Gambia and whose president, Macky Sall, is seen as Barrow’s closest ally. \nLater he will address the nation, and 52 pigeons, representing each year of independence from Britain, will be released. \nThe swearing-in ceremony on January 19 was held at a fraught time for the tiny west African nation, as Jammeh was refusing to step aside and acknowledge the result of the election Barrow won several weeks earlier. \nSenegal spearheaded efforts to deploy west African troops in The Gambia after Jammeh’s departure, in order to secure a country whose military forces were riven with factions still loyal to the ex-leader. \nAround 500 Senegalese, Ghanaian and Nigerian soldiers remain in the country and were helping provide security for the celebrations on Saturday. \nPresident Sall is a guest of honour at the ceremony, while Liberian leader Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who pushed for mediation efforts with Jammeh during his last days in office, is also expected. \nMauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was to attend, another key mediator during the nation’s crisis, along with US Assistant Secretary of State Linda Thomas-Greenfield, in a sign of efforts to reset ties with the West. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:33:20.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
