Kat Von D Is Launching 30 Everlasting Lip Liners \nIn the age where all beauty news seems to drop on Instagram first (excuse us, boss, while we check our phones and feeds), Kat von D likely just made your lunch break. The brand owner shared that her popular Everlasting Lipstick line will expand to include lip liners. \nThis is everything we know so far: the new Everlasting Lip Liners include 30 shades that launch on April 11. According to Kat's captions the \"formula is gonna change the lip liner world!\" She reveals it will be a retractable pen for easy sharpening, highly pigmented (\"like, FOR REALS\"), offer 24-hour wear, and stick to her usual ethical standards (vegan, cruelty-free). \n\"Here's the deal,\" she wrote. \"This unique, creamy formula glides on super easy. You let it dry for a few seconds and it's bulletproof! Never seen anything like it before and it truly is the most comfortable longwear lip liner I've ever used. No waxy-feeling, drying, or cracking! So exciting!\" \nAt noon PT, swatches will be released on @katvondbeauty , so stay tuned!
