Well, those vivid flowers weren’t just a figment of Hollywood magic. Similar poppies set California’s Antelope Valley ablaze in spring, luring road-trippers from L.A. and beyond.\nThe arrival of spring inspires us to break out from winter’s hibernation and embrace the fresh outdoors. A road trip naturally satisfies that spontaneous travel urge, and we’ve mapped America’s best spring drives—routes that bring you up-close to nature’s finest floral displays, from a California poppy tour to Texas Hill Country’s bluebonnets.\nOf course, flowers in bloom aren’t the only draw for these American road trips, many of which meander by woodlands, lakes, small quaint towns, even historic mansions and museums. Consider Colorado’s 232-mile San Juan Skyway, which takes visitors up melting snowcapped mountains, past natural hot springs, and through restored ghost towns. It’s an officially designated American Byway, one of nine we’ve featured, among them, Cherokee Foothills Scenic Highway in South Carolina.\nRoad trips are an American pastime, and you don’t need to travel far to enjoy some of spring’s loveliest drives—these routes start at 25 miles—and free smartphone apps like GasBuddy can point you to the cheapest nearby fuel options. Some of T+L’s other favorite gas-saving tips include: pack light (less weight in your vehicle means better gas mileage); charge it (many credit cards give cash back on gas purchases); and drive steady (conserve fuel by going easy on the pedals).\nNo matter what route you travel and no matter how many detours you take, spring into action this season by road-tripping through America’s most awe-inspiring floral landscapes.\nView As: One Page Slides Texas Hill Country Bluebonnet Tour BDphoto/ iStock The Route : 25 miles.\nThis green parkway reveals one floral show after another—591 wildflower species, from large-flowered valerians to Virginia bluebells—as you drive from the Great Falls of the Potomac through D.C. and south to Mount Vernon. The most famous are the cherry trees that bloom around the Tidal Basin in D.C.\nWhere to Stop: Hike the many trails that crisscross the 700-acre Turkey Run Park (just seven miles north of D.C.), which is carpeted in bluebells come late April.\nAcadia All American Road, Maine Flickr/William Brawley The Route : 40 miles.\nPack your binoculars for this coastal drive that skirts the woodlands of Acadia National Park , a prime spot for spying bald eagles and nesting peregrine. The 27-mile Park Loop Road segment follows the high ridges of Bar Harbor down to Sand Beach and Otter Cliff and loops inland along Jordan Pond. It’s the centerpiece of the drive, which starts in Trenton, takes Route 3 south, turns on the Loop Road, then rejoins Route 3.\nWhere to Stop: Local small towns begin buzzing in late spring. For homemade ice cream and popovers, pull over at the historic Jordan Pond House (open for the season as of May). Then put that energy to work hiking Acadia’s Cadillac Mountain, whose 1,532-foot peak overlooks the Atlantic.\nGeorge Washington Memorial Parkway, Maryland and Virginia amedved/ iStock The Route : 25 miles.\nThis green parkway reveals one floral show after another—591 wildflower species, from large-flowered valerians to Virginia bluebells—as you drive from the Great Falls of the Potomac through D.C. and south to Mount Vernon. The most famous are the cherry trees that bloom around the Tidal Basin in D.C.\nWhere to Stop: Hike the many trails that crisscross the 700-acre Turkey Run Park (just seven miles north of D.C.), which is carpeted in bluebells come late April.\nAntelope Valley, California aimintang/ iStock The Route: 70 miles.\nFrom L.A., drive north to the town of Lancaster via Route 14, better known as the Antelope Valley Freeway. Golden poppies bloom throughout the Mojave Desert region in March, but the 17,600-acre Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve claims the finest concentration of California’s state flower—not to mention glorious showings of fiddlenecks, creamcups, goldfields, and tidytips starting in late March.\nWhere to Stop: Drive the seven-mile Antelope Loop Trail within the Poppy Reserve and continue on to Antelope Butte Vista Point, a high lookout (the valley reaches an elevation of nearly 3,000 feet) that offers the most sweeping desert panoramas.\nCherokee Foothills Scenic Highway, South Carolina Peachoid/ Facebook The Route : 120 miles.\nThis National Scenic Byway sticks to an early Native American trail (the Cherokees called these foothills the Great Blue Hills of God) that weaves through the low Piedmont Hills past waterfalls, covered bridges, and brooks. To catch peach orchards and trees in full bloom, time your drive to late spring or early summer.\nWhere to Stop: Hundreds of roadside stands that begin filling with fruit in early June. The famous Peachoid water tower, painted to look like a colossal peach, is in the town of Gaffney, where mountain laurels begin to blossom in late May.\nHistoric Columbia River Highway, Oregon Rocky Grimes/ iStock The Route : 70 miles.\nThe Columbia River area has long been Oregon’s premier scenic attraction. Explore by driving from Portland through the Columbia River Gorge and on to volcanic Mount Hood, Oregon’s highest peak at over 11,000 feet. Multnomah Falls, one of the tallest yearlong waterfalls in the U.S., is another showstopper. Beginning in late March, look for wildflowers like purple Columbia kittentails on the shaded banks of waterfalls.\nWhere to Stop: 3 Rivers Grill (541-386-8883), in a Victorian house overlooking Hood River, for lunch. Detour over to the Washington side for the Maryhill Museum of Art and enjoy unparalleled views of the gorge.\nLouisiana Great River Road Lunnderboy/ iStock The Route : 70 miles.\nLet the Mississippi River be your guide on this winding route from Baton Rouge through Creole Country to New Orleans. Look out for former sugar plantations and majestic antebellum plantation houses—until the Civil War this area was one of the richest in America. Giant moss-draped oak trees nearly obscure the Creole cottages, surrounded by patches of budding wildflowers.\nWhere to Stop: Oak Alley Plantation in Vacherie. This Greek Revival mansion was built in 1839 and stands at the end of a long avenue lined with oak trees. In New Orleans, check into the buzzy Saint Hotel , in the former Audubon Building in the French Quarter.\nHana Highway, Hawaii Shutterstock The Route: 52 miles.\nTropical flowers bloom each spring along the Road to Hana, which paves its way through bamboo fields, rainforests, and waterfalls like 80-foot Wailua Falls, which appeared in the credits of TV show “Fantasy Island.” Start in Kahului, and head down Maui’s northeastern coast. Just don’t be fooled by the 52-mile count—this is an intense drive that can take up to four hours as you navigate over 600 hairpin turns and more than 50 one-lane bridges. The payoff comes from the spectacular views and bragging rights.\nWhere to Stop: Fuel up with pancakes soaked in coconut syrup at Anthony’s Coffee Co. in the funky small town of Paia. Just beyond mile marker 32 awaits Waianapanapa State Park , with black-sand beaches and trails leading to sea caves and lava cliffs.\nSan Juan Skyway, Colorado Shutterstock The Route : 232 miles.\nThe skyway’s biggest thrills come along the stretch between the Victorian-era towns of Ouray and Silverton that’s known as the Million Dollar Highway. While that name could easily describe the views, it actually refers to the massive amounts of silver and gold once carted through these passes. Four-wheelers can also attempt to traverse the rugged 65-mile Alpine Loop Back Country Byway past the 19th-century ghost towns of Howardsville, Eureka, and Animas Forks.\nWhere to Stop: Mesa Verde National Park , famous for Anasazi Indian cliff dwellings that were abandoned 200 years before Columbus arrived in America. And at Dunton Hot Springs Resort , in a restored ghost town, soak in waters ranging from 85°F to 106°F and rich in calcium bicarbonate, iron, and manganese.\nSanta Fe/Taos Loop, New Mexico Tashka/ iStock The Route: 191 miles.\nFollow the (literal) High Road from Santa Fe north on Route 285 through high-elevation deserts and orchards. It leads to the cottonwood-dotted valley of Ojo Caliente and its pueblo communities; the Taos Pueblo compound , a UNESCO World Heritage site, was built before 1400 and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in America. Loop back from Taos on the Low Road, State Route 68, which runs along the Rio Grande past wineries.\nWhere to Stop: Over ten galleries display Native American jewelry, textiles, and pottery at the Millicent Rogers museum , named after Taos’ famed art-enthusiast and socialite.\nTamiami Trail, Florida bririemoments/ iStock The Route: 275 miles.\nThis trail snakes along Florida’s tropical western coast from Tampa through Sarasota, Fort Myers, and Naples before crossing the Everglades and rolling into Miami. Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park —“the Amazon of North America”—is the place to marvel at native royal palms and rare species of orchids. This is the swampland featured in Susan Orlean’s novel The Orchid Thief, the source for the film Adaptation.\nWhere to Stop: The breezy resort islands of Sanibel and Captiva.\nCrowley’s Ridge Parkway, Arkansas and Missouri half fast hiker/ Flickr The Route : 198 miles.\nApril brings flowering dogwoods, redbuds, and daffodils to this parkway that cuts through northeast Arkansas and extends up into Missouri. As an erosional remnant of the last glaciation, Crowley’s Ridge is one of North America’s most unique landforms and supports a number of rare species, from netted chain fern to black chokeberry. It’s also convenient for detouring into protected nature reserves like the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests .\nWhere to Stop: Civil War buffs can appreciate the sesquicentennial at Chalk Bluff Battlefield Park, the site of a major battle where Confederate forces claimed tactical victory.\nMerritt Parkway, Connecticut Merritt Parkway/ Facebook The Route : 37 miles.\nStretching from the New York–Connecticut state line up to the town of Milford, CT, the Merritt Parkway was a 1930s Depression-era project—and remains one of America’s oldest and prettiest parkways. Each of the 69 historic bridges has a distinctive look, and the surrounding meadows and woodlands are blissfully sprawl-free (spring brings brilliant displays of roadside mountain laurels).\nWhere to Stop: More than 2,000 plants thrive at Stamford’s 91-acre Bartlett Arborteum . For brunch, try the lobster and avocado BLT at Westport’s Spotted Horse Tavern, housed in the city’s historic Sherwood House, which dates back to the early 1800’s.\nHighway 1, California iStock / LUNAMARINA The Route: 121 miles.\nStarting in San Francisco, cruise down America’s iconic coastline, passing Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz, until you reach Pacific Grove, just outside of Monterey. The town’s seaside trail in Lovers Point Park is carpeted in magnificent magenta ice plants by late March each year.\nWhere to Stop: Gaze out toward the Pacific Ocean and Santa Lucia Mountains during an indulgent lunch at Nepenthe restaurant in Big Sur. Choices range from their famous Abrosiaburger steak sandwich to a roasted beet salad sprinkled with blue cheese.\nLake Shore Drive, Illinois RudyBalasko/ iStock The Route: 18 miles.\nFrom Edgewater Beach head down to Jackson Park on this section of U.S. 41, which skirts crystal blue Lake Michigan and cuts through Chicago’s urban parks. Each spring, approximately 143,000 tulips and pansies are planted along Michigan Avenue.\nWhere to Stop : Rows of tulip beds bloom at the Buckingham Fountain Flower Garden inside 319-acre Grant Park.\nBrockway Mountain Drive SPP Photography/ iStock The Route: 9 miles.\nThis short and sweet scenic drive atop the spine of Brockway Mountain (the highest road in the Midwest) offers sweeping views of Lake Superior and the jagged cliffs along the Upper Michigan coastline. With more than 700 types of wildflowers—not to mention patches of wild strawberries—Brockway is the region’s prime springtime floral spot.\nWhere to Stop: Along the Keweenaw Peninsula, the northernmost part of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and the site of orchids and running rivers. Migrating hawks linger around the bird-watching point, most notably in mid-April.\nSkyline Drive Shutterstock The Route: 105 miles.\nThis route stretches through Shenandoah National Park , end-to-end, with the surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains and more than 1,300 species of plants. Warm weather brings purple and yellow violets; by May, pink azaleas appear throughout the forest, followed by white flowers of mountain laurel in early June.\nWhere to Stop: Shenandoah National Park hosts its annual Wildflower Weekend in early May, featuring special talks and guided nature hikes showcasing local wildlife.\nCatalina (a.k.a. Mount Lemmon) Highway, Arizona photoworks1/ iStock The Route: 28 miles.\nThe 9,157-foot Mount Lemmon is the crowning peak among the Santa Catalina Mountains, which rise along the northeast edge of Tucson. This paved road—one of the few in the area—winds from dry desert terrain, through cool greenery, and high into the mountains, where you’ll spot spring wildflowers, from Mexican golden poppies to red fairy dusters.\nWhere to Stop: Hike Babad Do’ag Trail, which starts at the road’s first pull-offs. The path is studded with native saguaro cacti and overlooks the desert Tucson Valley region.\nBighorn Scenic Byway, Wyoming DC_Colombia/ iStock The Route : 58 miles.\nStart in Shell, WY (a town named after the Jurassic fossil shells once found in the area), and make your way into Bighorn National Forest , where you’re likely to spot native American alpine wildflowers growing above timberline. Water tumbling down the park’s mammoth Shell Falls drops at 3,600 gallons per seconds and follows a course carved by fractures in granite.\nWhere to Stop: Recharge your (spiritual) batteries at the Medicine Wheel National Historic Landmark, a sacred stone circle believed to have been used by prehistoric Native American groups.\nNewfound Gap Road, Tennessee and North Carolina rickberk/ iStock The Route : 33 miles.\nWith more than 270 miles of roadways crisscrossing the Smokies, you certainly have your pick of spring drives. But Newfound Gap is a natural choice; at 5,046 feet, it’s the lowest drivable pass through the mountains, connecting North Carolina with Tennessee via Great Smoky Mountains National Park . Purple Catawba rhododendrons, found only at high elevations, reach their peak of bloom along this well-known drive by early June.\nWhere to Stop : Eighty-foot Laurel Falls, named for the surrounding mountains’ laurels that bloom in May. And just south of Newfound Gap is the seven-mile Clingmans Dome Road, which leads to the highest peak in the Smokies.\nU.S. Route 9, New York Randy OHC/ iStock The Route: 57 miles.\nThe entire route runs more than 300 miles from Delaware up to the U.S.-Canada border, but this 57-mile lower New York stretch has special appeal when the weather warms.
