The circus can seem like nothing but a good time if you’re sitting in the audience. As a viewer, all you see is a perfectly orchestrated performance featuring animals doing amazing tricks – it’s pretty easy to get swept up in the show. But if you take a look behind the scenes at these performances, things aren’t quite so magical. \nThe Great Bear Show is run by Bob Steele, an exhibitor with a long history of violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act. According to PETA , the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) cited Steele twice for failing to provide a bear named Barney with adequate veterinary care. This happened after two inspections revealed that the animal was missing large patches of hair and had scratched his skin excessively. Care2 \nIf that wasn’t enough, Steele also carts around an arthritic bear named Andy, who has exhibited a labored gait and is apparently often confined to enclosures with a concrete substrate and no padding. The USDA has also cited Steele for failing to keep the bears under his direct control, not having them on leashes, and failing to use sufficient barriers to separate them from observers. The Great Bear Show is also a threat to the safety of those who view the show. This is unacceptable. To make matters worse, River’s Edge Convention Center management in St. Cloud, Minnesota, appears to be moving forward with plans to host the show. Please help bears by signing this petition asking that the River’s Edge Convention Center to cancel The Great Bear Show! \nAnimals may not be the same as us, but that doesn’t mean they deserve to be treated as if they have any less value. You can help these captive bears by signing the petition below and boycotting any establishment that showcases live animals for entertainment. When people stop paying, the abuse can stop. \nLead Image Source: skeeze /Pixabay Want to read more posts like this?
