Dozens of police departments throughout the U.S. use the devices, often concealing that fact from suspects and their lawyers during court proceedings. \nCourts have issued conflicting opinions about whether government agents need a warrant to track Americans through their cellphones and other GPS devices.

However, the court did not say whether a warrant is required to track people through their cellphones, the OnStar systems in their vehicles, or other electronic devices such as fitness bracelets. \n\"Congress has an obligation to act quickly to protect Americans from violations of their privacy made possible by emerging technologies,\" said Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee. \"As we welcome innovative technologies that help fight crime, we must be mindful of the potential for abuse.\" \nRead more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:17:22.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
