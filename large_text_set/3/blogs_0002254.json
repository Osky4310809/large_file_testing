Could   \nA rapidly growing crater known as the \"hellmouth\" has given scientists a fascinating insight into 200,000 years of climate history. \nThe 300ft-deep Batagaika Crater in Siberia is expanding a rate of 30 to 100 feet each year allowing scientists to see ancient layers that once lay hidden. \nThe crater, in northern Yakutia, is referred to as a \"mega slump\" and dubbed by locals as the \"Doorway to the Underworld\". \nAs a permafrost continues to thaw away its layers, the ground underneath becomes more exposed. \nThis enables researchers to see what the landscape once looked like, helping them to predict the changes yet to come. \nIn a new study, published in Quaternary Research , researchers analysed the sequence of permafrost deposits in the Batagaika crater, revealing a number of different environmental conditions throughout the years.

The crater is so large it's visible from space (Photo: Google) \nJulian Murton of the University of Sussex told the BBC that the layers provide a \"continuous record of geological history, which is fairly unusual. \n\"That should allow us to interpret the climate and environmental history there. \n\"We are still working on the chronology.\" Read More \nThe now half-a-mile-long crater first formed in a clearing of forest land in the 1960s. \nIt sits near the village of Batagai, in the Verkhoyansk district. \nMany villagers believe it is a 'portal to the underworld' after hearing monstrous sounds coming from it. \nBut scientists say they are likely to be produced by falling soil rather than creatures from the deep.
