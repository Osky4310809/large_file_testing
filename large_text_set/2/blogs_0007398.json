Advocates have urged the state to follow New Mexico, Kentucky and New Jersey, all of which have either changed or gotten rid of the money-based bail system in recent years.\nAttorney General Brian E. Frosh tweeted that the rule change is a “huge win for justice in MD.”\nFrosh asked the court late last year to consider changing the directives given to judges as they set bail.\nHe and other critics of the state’s bail system said that the current system was unfair and possibily unconstitutional.\nThis story will be updated.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@OvettaWashPost"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:51:54.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
