I think we're about to see a big shakeup across the marketplace. Marrk on 27/03/2017 - 09:13 \nAlways see their ads on Hulu, I find it funny how they went from saying that 5GB is more than enough for most people based on a study, to offering Unlimited plans. Pretty substantial, since Verizon is basically the Telstra of the U.S. in terms of coverage. Give it a year or two, and Australia will get unlimited mobile data plans. We are already almost there with Vivid Wireless ($90 unlimited, though throttled to 10/1Mbps). \nhow do i use the offer to get the 100g for only 120? \nThrough the Optus 25 year offer. Link in description +2 votes \n100GB on mobile data, good deal because its faster than NBN. +1 vote \nNot if your NBN is 100Mbps. 4G does go over sometimes but rarely‚Ä¶ \nwhat? 4G can be quicker than my Telstra Cable? I DID NOT KNOW THAT. Thanks! \nbut mobile internet lag is horrendous if your a leet gam3r. Keep the cable playa \nI use Vivid Wireless (Optus 4G), and the internet was so slow yesterday that I couldn't even do a speed test. BradleyDS2 on 27/03/2017 - 09:23 \nMust have been unlucky. With Kogan I can get over 5Mbps downloads when using my phone as a wifi hotspot, and it's $1 for 14GB. +2 votes \nAlmost enough data to ditch my slow home ADSL and hotspot everything through my phone. \nConsidering this but will Netflix and music streaming be covered under free data? Previously asked optus staff who didn't know the answer. \nData free Netflix is included. Note the \"mobile TV streaming\" in \"included entertainment\". :) pingponged on 27/03/2017 - 08:57 \niphone 7 plus 32gb is included on the 100gb plan (with this you probably have enough data to realistically use cloud storage for everything) or 128gb for $6 more on the F&F deal. So even if you just wanted the plan, just sell the phones off and save ~$1k? \nNo iphone 7 or 7 plus in product RED. Nice deal though with unlimited international roaming üëç", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:26:07.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
