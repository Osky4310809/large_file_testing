There's a swimsuit line called Enchanted Bikinis in the world, and it's exclusively dedicated to selling Disney princessâ€“inspired swimsuits. \nWhile the line is not officially associated with Disney, each suit is pitch-perfect in its execution. Belle and Jasmine's yellow and mint suits, respectively, feature their dresses' off-the-shoulder style, while Ariel's top is shell-shaped and Pocahontas' pieces are fringed. Even the Rapunzel swimsuit boasts the same lace-up accent as her cartoon counterpart's bodice. \nAnd the price is on point: The tops run $45, while the bottoms retail for $35. There's also a mermaid skirt, a seashell purse and a seashell mirror phone case, all about $30 or less. \nScroll to see all the Disney cuteness, and shop it all at enchantedbikinis.com .
