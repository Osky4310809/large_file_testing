Weiss and David Benioff , alongside actors Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams . \nBut aside from revealing details about the final season’s episode count and whether or not they’d be involved in HBO’s potential spinoff plans , the group also talked about the series retrospectively. \nAnd while they did reveal some of their favorite behind the scenes moments and interactions, the two producers also spoke about some of the grislier aspects of Game of Thrones, including discussing characters who’ve met untimely ends. \nTurner and Williams asked the showrunners which characters they’d most like to see resurrected on the screen. Though the fans in attendance let their opinion known (“Hodor!”) Weiss and Benioff gave different answers, revealing they’d like to see Catelyn Stark and Joffrey Baratheon back on the screen. UP NEXT: Showrunners Will Not Be Involved With Spinoffs \nPlayed by Michelle Fairley, Catelyn met her demise alongside her son, daughter-in-law, and unborn grandchild in one of the series most infamous events, the Red Wedding. \nJoffrey, played by Jack Gleeson, became the young king of Westeros after his father was killed. He was an petty and violent child who was a major source of torment to many of the characters in the saga and is considered among the best villains on the show. He finally met his fate when he was poisoned by Olenna Tyrell, who didn’t want her daughter Margaery to marry such a monster. \nThe two also admitted that it was hard to kill off Khal Drogo in the series. \n“[We] could never get over having to kill off Jason Momoa because he was larger than life,” they said. \nFind out which character this sadistic pair will off next when Game of Thrones' latest season begins July 16.
