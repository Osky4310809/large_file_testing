You either like his films or you don’t. It is not like a typical commercial film that is going to cater to everybody’s taste and sensibilities, he caters to a certain section of audience and that is why some critics have revered it and called it a piece of art. Vishal Bhardwaj is known for that. So when you do a film like that, with a lot of love for cinema, the actors get lot of appreciation. Some films are beyond box office collections.” Kareena Kapoor Khan and the Rangoon poster. Images from News 18. \nShe further added, “Saif has been in the industry for 25 long years. He is beyond success or failure of his movies.\" \nEarlier, during Rangoon’s special screening, Kareena was all praises for the film and went on to say that she was expecting it to be one of the best films of the year. Kareena had earlier been a part of Bhardwaj’s 2006 release Omkara , which also had Saif in his finest performance as Langda Tyagi, though the duo were not cast opposite each other in the movie. \nNew mommy on the block may be taking it easy after the arrival of baby Taimur, but come May, the actress will be back where she belongs – in front of the camera. \nShe will bounce back into action and kickstart the shoot of Veere Di Wedding in May. Veere Di Wedding is Rhea Kapoor's ambitious chick flick, which also stars Sonam Kapoor, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania. Kareena said that she is currently utilizing the time for getting back into shape. “The preparation for the film is just hitting the gym, that is the only focus as of now,” laughs Kareena, who doesn’t regret losing out on the fourth instalment of the Golmaal series to Parineeti Chopra. \nKareena was part of the last two instalments of Rohit Shetty and Ajay Devgn's comedy but had walked out of the film owing to her pregnancy. “I couldn’t have done Golmaal . I am at a stage when I am also not ready to start a film before May. It wouldn’t have worked out,” she says. \n“But yes,” she continues, “I am definitely reading scripts. I have worked throughout my pregnancy but now Veere De Wedding is a priority. Once that finishes I will take up something else because I can’t do two films at one time. I need to balance things out. Priorities keep changing in life. First I was married and now I have a family, I have always done multi-tasking, something women understand that they have to do.” She further states, “Even after marriage, it was always one film at a time. I would always want to finish a film, take a break and then go for the next. Both, Saif and I am going to maintain that.\" \nAlongside her movie career, Kareena has for the first time entered the television space and a soon-to-be-launched factual entertainment channel has roped her as its ‘Feel Alive’ ambassador. The channel, among other things, will talk about saving earth, adventure sports, wild life and global warming. Sonam Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan.

I will experience as it comes because the journey of every mother is their own. It is such a personal experience. Tomorrow , even if my sister Karisma has to give me tips or advice, I will tell her, ‘Listen, this is your journey, it is like your relationship with your son. I am taking it as it comes.” \nDoes she have sleepless nights? “I would call them as more joyous nights than sleepless nights. It is so exciting. I won’t even want to think that I'm losing out on my sleep; it is a joy and pleasure to be up with him.” \nWhile Kareena evaded the controversy surrounding her newborn's name, she did touch upon the media focus on her pregnancy. So did it seem like an intrusion into her experience? \n“Being a celebrity anything is an intrusion. Of course, pregnancy is something that I chose to share with everyone, I didn’t want to hide. Lot of women, when pregnant, probably wouldn’t want to go out or continue with normal things. The amount of advertisements I shot for, the brands or campaigns I shot for when I was pregnant was as much as I probably shot for when I was not. That is the way I chose to live my life,” says Kareena, further adding, “this is always the personality that people and my fans relate to and I am a happier person when I try not to hide things from them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T07:37:18.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
