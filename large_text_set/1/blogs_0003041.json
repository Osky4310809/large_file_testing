Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports/Mark J. Rebilas Matt Moreno FOX Sports Kansas City Jan 3, 2017 at 6:39p ET 0Shares \nThe Kansas City Royals are continuing to add to their already crowded outfield. \nOn Tuesday, the Royals acquired Peter O’Brien from the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Royals traded minor league pitcher Sam Lewis in return. \nThe 26-year-old outfield has been a top prospect in the Diamondbacks’ minor league system for years but is yet to find his stroke at the major-league level. O’Brien played in 28 games with the Diamondbacks last year, recording five home runs, nine RBI and a .141 batting average. \nO’Brien started his minor-league career as a catcher before moving primarily to the outfield in 2015. \nLewis, 25, finished his 2016 season with Wilmington (A), appearing in a total of 19 games for three different Royals’ minor league affiliates. \nThe Royals’ trade for O’Brien comes roughly a month after they picked up Jorge Soler from the Cubs in exchange for closer Wade Davis. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:45:33.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
