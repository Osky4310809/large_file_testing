But one thing that took a nosedive due to these advancements is the battery life. The battery of a smartphone is probably the one thing that has advanced at a much slower rate than other hardware. But, better late than never. With brands pushing beefier batteries even inside slim phones, we’re finally seeing some worthy long-lasting devices. The fact that other hardware like processors and cameras have become highly efficient adds to the cause. So if you’re in the market looking for a battery-centric phone that doesn’t burn a hole through your pocket, you’re at the right place. Here are the top five smartphones with powerful batteries, all priced below Rs 15,000. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Rs 9,999 onwards) With the kind of popularity enjoyed by its predecessor, the recently unveiled Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 has some big shoes to fill. The Redmi Note 4 certainly seems promising in that respect as it not only improves the design and shooting capabilities of the Redmi Note 3, but also takes a big step forward in terms of battery life. The shift to the highly-efficient Snapdragon 625 SoC means that the massive 4,100mAh battery lasts way longer than the 4,050mAh battery of the Redmi Note 3. The phone is no slouch when it comes to performance either, as it can run almost anything you throw at it without breaking a sweat. With up to 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a beautiful 5.5-inch full HD display, the Redmi Note 4 comes across as an attractive, all-round package. Coolpad Cool1 Dual (Rs 13,999) One of the latest devices in the segment, the Coolpad Cool1 Dual is a smartphone to look out for. Not only does it come with a beefy 4,000mAh battery with fast charging support, but also with a future-proof USB Type-C port that is slowly becoming the norm. Powering the phone is the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, aided by 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 510 GPU. The major highlight of the device are its 13MP dual cameras at the back, something, not every phone can boast about in this segment. Honor 6X (Rs 12,999) Honor updated its budget smartphone lineup with the launch of the Honor 6X. Like the Cool 1 Dual mentioned above, the USP of the Honor 6X is the presence of a dual-camera setup on the back as well. However, that’s not all that the 6X has going for it as the device offers great battery life from its 3,340mAh cell. While the battery unit on its own is not that big, the use of a homebred Kirin 655 SoC allows the Honor 6X to go the extra mile. Other specs of the smartphone include a 5.5-inch full HD display, a pair of 12MP and 2MP     on the back below the camera module. nubia N1 (Rs 11,999) If you think these 4,000mAh battery-toting smartphones won’t cut for you, then here’s a phone that sports a massive 5,000mAh battery as well as a USB Type-C port. Priced at Rs 11,999, the ZTE nubia N1 comes with all the things one would want in a smartphone its price – an octa-core MediaTek MT6755 SoC, 3GB of RAM, a 5.5-inch full HD display, and 13MP rear and front cameras. To top it off, it has a huge battery backup that can keep it going on for long hours without needing to recharge – something which instantly sets it apart from the competition. Last but not the least, the device features a metal body made from aircraft-grade aluminum. ZTE Blade A2 Plus (Rs 11,999) If you don’t fancy the look or the design of the ZTE Nubia but want a device with similar specifications, then the company has another battery-beast in its roster in the form of the ZTE Blade A2 Plus. Launched recently, the smartphone features a unibody metal design underneath which rests its massive 5,000mAh battery. Priced similar to its Nubia counterpart, the ZTE Blade A2 comes sporting a 5.5-inch full HD display, a MediaTek octa-core chip along with 4GB of RAM. ASUS Zenfone 3S Max (Rs 14,990) The biggest compromise that users have to make when buying a smartphone with a huge battery is the handset’s size as a bigger battery requires more space. However, with the ASUS ZenFone 3S Max, users get a 5,000mAh battery in a compact form factor. The device sports a 5.2-inch HD screen and is powered by a MediaTek octa-core CPU. While a full HD panel would have been better for media consumption, the HD display will help elongate the smartphone’s battery even more.
