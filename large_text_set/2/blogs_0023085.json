The counselor to President Donald Trump , one of the new administration's most visible faces, was pulled off the air by the White House, CNN's Dylan Byers reported Wednesday afternoon.\nByers added in a tweet that Conway's hiatus was temporary.\n\"Kellyanne Conway now tells me she'll be going on Fox News tonight...\"\nIt has been more than a week since Conway appeared on television - an eternity, by her standard. The White House continued to trot her out after she coined the phrase \"alternative facts,\" cited a \"Bowling Green massacre\" that never happened and promoted Ivanka Trump's products on Fox News, but apparently Trump could not abide statements that undermined the administration's official message.\n'Morning Joe' has blacklisted Kellyanne Conway Callum Borchers MSNBC 's Mika Brzezinski said Wednesday that she refuses to book Kellyanne Conway on \"Morning Joe\" - and that wasn't even the harshest thing Brzezinski and co-host Joe Scarborough said about the counselor to the president.\n\"We know for a fact she tries to book herself on this show,\" Brzezinski said....\nMSNBC 's Mika Brzezinski said Wednesday that she refuses to book Kellyanne Conway on \"Morning Joe\" - and that wasn't even the harshest thing Brzezinski and co-host Joe Scarborough said about the counselor to the president.\n\"We know for a fact she tries to book herself on this show,\" Brzezinski said....\n(Callum Borchers) Last Monday, she said on MSNBC that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn \"does enjoy the full confidence of the president.\" Less than an hour later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer contradicted her when he said that Trump was \"evaluating the situation.\" Flynn resigned as national security adviser that night.\nThe next day, Conway appeared on multiple morning shows and said it was Flynn's decision to step down. But Spicer again contradicted her when he said in his daily press briefing that Trump \"asked for and received [Flynn's] resignation.\"\nEarlier this month, after the \"Bowling Green massacre\" episode, CNN refused to book Conway on its Sunday political talk show but interviewed her two days later. Last Wednesday, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski said she would not allow the former Trump campaign manager to appear on \"Morning Joe\" because \"every time I've ever seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect.\"\nThe White House's problem with Conway appears to have been different from journalists' - it wasn't that she made false statements but that her statements were off-message.\nCNN reported that the decision to sideline Conway was made by \"the president and his top advisers.\" That is not very specific, but it seems notable that the move coincided with the hiring last week of a White House communications director, Mike Dubke.\nThe addition of Dubke signaled that the White House intended to get everyone on point. Conway, for a while anyway, was not.\nCopyright Â© 2017, Orlando Sentinel Kellyanne Conway Donald Trump Michael Flynn Fox News Channel NBCUniversal Sean Spicer", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58a4cd3d/turbine/ct-morning-joe-kellyanne-conway-20170215", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ae0994/turbine/ct-kellyanne-conway-pulled-off-air-20170222"], "published": "2017-02-23T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:24:55.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
