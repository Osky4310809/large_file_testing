He said he did not. \n“I explained she had a circuit card,” Lee said. “Which means she is not a trespasser and she was not disrupting service.” \n“It was excessively punitive,” said Jill Willis, Lee’s attorney, on behalf of the men along with eight other African American Metra police officers, she has filed this federal lawsuit, accusing Metra of racial discrimination. \n“It appears to be a pattern of trying to reduce African American employment base in order to bring in younger white and Hispanic officers,” Willis said. \nA patter, Willis said, began a couple of years ago and according to suit, blacks are denied promotions, unjustly terminated and unfairly disciplined while, “white officers charged with serious disciplinary issues ae given the option to resign.” \n“I was fired for taking a class to be promoted.” \nLarry Geanes worked at the agency 19 years and took a class to become a detective. He said he was fired because he did not get permission for taking the class, but he claims that rule was implemented after his termination. \n“I’m very hurt. I’m angry,” Geanes said. “We are just treated unfairly. Discipline is metered out unfairly.” \nCBS 2 reached out to Metra. Their response: “We vehemently deny these allegations of racism and discrimination. This lawsuit from current and former police officers, most of whom were justifiably disciplined for dishonesty or negligence in the performance of their duties, has absolutely no merit. We will relentlessly contest these allegations in a court of law and are confident we will prevail.” \nAttorneys for the police officers say they have yet to hear from Metra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:35:23.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
