Now, Kendrick has made good on the rumor mill and dropped a brand new song titled “The Heart Part 4.” Listen to it below:\n\n\nThe track confirms wide-spread speculation that Kendrick is coming very close to dropping his fourth album. He seems to admit this much himself; at the end of the track one can hear him say “Y’all got ’til April 7 to get y’all shit together,” teasing what very well could be a release date to the proper follow-up to 2015’s To Pimp a Butterfly . Stay tuned to see what happens next.\nIn other music news, Gorillaz have announced their new album Humanz and have shared a new music video.
