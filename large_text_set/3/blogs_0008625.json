(RELATED: Nonprofits Helping Illegal Immigrants Took $291 Million From Taxpayers) \nSeven of those – worth over $13 million – were awarded under the Unaccompanied Alien Children Program, and the remaining two – worth $4.5 million – were used to helped refugees. \nMeanwhile, LIRS received $25 million in federal funds in the four months following former President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection, data shows. Both HHS and the State Department awarded those grants. \nLIRS took another $29 million and $25 million over the same time period during the following two years. \nBut funds awarded to the charity this time last year dropped significantly. LIRS, in fact, received $1,565 less between November 2015 to March 2016 compared to that same time period since Trump’s election. \nLIRS ultimately raked in $60 million total for fiscal 2016 – more than any other year during Obama’s second term, and received $220 million total over his final four years in office. HHS and the State Department awarded each grant to help refugees and unaccompanied children. \nFollow Ethan on Twitter . Send tips to [email protected] .
