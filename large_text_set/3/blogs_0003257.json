Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 \n“How low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy,” Trump tweeted from his personal account. \nBeau Willimon added that the presidency of America comes with a huge responsibility and Trump’s tweets have a “real and significant impact on the business of governance, world affairs and national security.” \nWillimon added that Donald Trump’s recent outburst against Barack Obama gives a bad impact on other foreign leaders. 2. Only one person on @Twitter is President of the United States. That comes with a supreme and unique responsibility unlike any other user. \n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) March 4, 2017 \n“That makes Trump’s tweets a national security threat. It emboldens our enemies to take advantage of his flagrant shortcomings,” he added. 5. His tweets recklessly bypass diplomatic channels without consultation from the State Department, IC or the Pentagon. \n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) March 4, 2017 \nHe further added that Donald Trump’s recent outburst against the media has makes “the argument for himself being a liability to the people.” \nAddressing Twitter, he concluded the series of tweets by asking the social media platform to use their power and medium to help everyone who wants to protect this world. [Image by Alex Wong/Getty Images] \n“In fact, with your worldwide reach and impact on the media, you have a duty to steer clear of accounts facilitating national security threats. Twitter is amazing. It connects the world. That comes with its own responsibility: to do your part in protecting that world.” \nThis is not for the first time when House of Cards creator has waged a war against Donald Trump on his social media handle. Back in February, Willimon took to Twitter to send a series of 25 tweets forming his own Declaration of Resistance that showed his disdain for President Trump. \nBeau’s Declaration of Resistance is modeled after America’s Declaration of Independence and in a series of tweets, he accused Donald Trump of conducting tyranny over States and even demanded his impeachment. 1. DECLARATION OF RESISTANCE \nWhen in the course of American history it becomes necessary for the people to save our Nation from a Tyrant, \n— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 3, 2017 \nBeau’s started the series of tweets by urging everyone to come together to save the “Nation from a Tyrant.” In the rest of his tweets, the former creator of Netflix’s hit political drama series stated that it is the people’s right to make demands of Congress when such a form of government comes in power. \nIn the remaining tweets, Beau cited Trump’s injuries and usurpations. He also criticized Donald Trump’s decision of creating the cabinet that is filled with “amateur ideologues.” \nBeau Willimon is not the only member of House of Cards who has talked about Donald Trump in the recent time. \nDuring the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, Kevin Spacey, the Academy Award-winning actor who plays the role of America’s President in House of Cards , mocked Donald Trump and even called him a “disease.” \nDuring his opening monolog, Spacey informed the crowd that amfAR regular Sharon Stone would not be attending the Gala- despite being a regular, because she is distressed by a disease called Donald Trump.

I don’t think I could ever vote for a candidate who wasn’t in favor of separation of man and face.” \nSpacey also stated that Trump may enjoy the Cannes Film Festival but not for the same reasons as the others because “there are so many casinos to bankrupt.” \nDo you think Donald Trump should delete his Twitter account for good?
