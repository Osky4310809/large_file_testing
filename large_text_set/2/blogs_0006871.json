(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President Trump lashed out Thursday on Twitter at the Democratic senator who publicly shared that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch had told him he found Trump’s attacks on the federal judiciary “disheartening” and “demoralizing.”\nIn a morning tweet, Trump tried to question the credibility of Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) by referring to a 2010 acknowledgment by the then-Connecticut attorney general that he had misspoken about having served in Vietnam, when in fact he had never gone to war.\n“Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?” Trump said in his tweet.\nSen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017\nOn Wednesday, Blumenthal relayed to reporters comments he said were made by Gorsuch, Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, during a private meeting. The account was confirmed by Ron Bonjean, a member of the group guiding the judge through his confirmation process on behalf of Trump's administration.\n[ Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch says Trump’s attacks on judiciary are ‘demoralizing’ ]\nTrump did not elaborate about how he thought Gorsuch's comments had been misrepresented. The White House did not immediately respond to a request to explain the president's assertion on Twitter.\nBlumenthal stood by his account in an interview with The Post on Thursday morning.\nIf the president has any doubts about Gorsuch's comments, “his own White House staff was in the room, so I think he just needs to talk to them,” Blumenthal said.\nAs for Trump's attack on Blumenthal's fabricated history of military service in Vietnam during the war, the senator said: “The issue is really not about me. It's about the independence of the American judiciary. There is a fundamental core democratic principle at stake.”\n“Judge Gorsuch needs to stand up to this bullying, and I believe he has to publicly condemn it,” the senator added.\nWatch Neil Gorsuch's full speech after President Trump picked the appeals judge to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia's Supreme Court seat. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Blumenthal told reporters Wednesday that Gorsuch gave him permission to make his comments public. But the senator also said he had urged Gorsuch to speak out directly.\nIn a statement Thursday, former senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who heads the team shepherding Gorsuch through the confirmation process, said that in his discussions with senators, the judge has “emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary.”\n“While he made clear that he was not referring to any specific case, he said that he finds any criticism of a judge's integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing,” Ayotte said.\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) also spoke out Thursday about a conversation he said he had with Gorsuch about Trump's remarks on the federal judiciary.\n“He got pretty passionate about it,” Sasse said on MSNBC's “Morning Joe” program.\nSasse said that Gorsuch told him “any attack on ... brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges.”\n[ Trump’s rallying cry: Fear itself ]\nTrump has made several disparaging comments about the federal judiciary in the wake of an order halting his directive temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\nIn a speech to law enforcement officials, Feb. 8, President Trump read federal law giving broad him broad authority to set immigration restrictions, adding, \"a bad high school student would understand this.\" (The Washington Post) Trump on Wednesday declared that an appeals court’s hearing Tuesday night regarding his controversial immigration executive order was “disgraceful” and that judges were more concerned about politics than following the law.\nThe remarks followed earlier tweets from Trump disparaging “the so-called judge” who issued a nationwide stop to his plan and saying the ruling “put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system.”\nBlumenthal came under sharp criticism during his 2010 Senate campaign for repeated remarks over the years that he had “served” in Vietnam, even though he did his full Marine service in the United States. Blumenthal obtained several deferments between 1965 and 1970 and then joined the Marine Corps Reserve, but did not serve in Vietnam. He later said he misspoke and intended to say that he was in the Marine Reserve during the Vietnam conflict.\nLater Thursday morning, Trump also heavily criticized CNN's Chris Cuomo for how he handled an interview with Blumenthal regarding his meeting with Gorsuch.\n“Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave 'service' in Vietnam,” Trump said on Twitter.\n“FAKE NEWS!” the president added, using a term he has frequently employed to describe CNN and other media in recent weeks.\nChris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave \"service\" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017\nIn fact, Cuomo did ask Blumenthal about his military service during the interview.\n\"The president, with all due respect, is once again off on the facts,” Cuomo later said on the air after reading Trump’s tweet and replaying part of the interview.\nEd O'Keefe contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/02-08-2017/t_1486565567183_name_20170208_trump_reading.jpg", "https://twitter.com/@WPJohnWagner", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/02-01-2017/t_1485913087410_name_AFP_LA91K.jpg", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829660612452036608", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829681034564341760"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:21:58.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
