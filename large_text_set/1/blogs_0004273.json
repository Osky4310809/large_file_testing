So it’s pretty exciting to see if Pacquiao says yes or not and when the contracts gets signed.” Jeff Horn at Suncorp Stadium, where his fight with Manny Pacquiao is set to take place. Source: News Corp Australia \nAnd Horn is not just looking to win but become the first fighter to knock out Pacquiao since Juan Manuel Marquez destroyed the Pacman with a single punch in 2012. \n“Yeah, definitely,” he said, adding: “He’s probably got a little bit more cautious with how he doesn’t finish guys as much either. At welterweight, he hasn’t stopped a guy for a while. I definitely think I’ve got what it takes to get him.” \nPacquiao hasn’t stopped anyone since his TKO victory over Miguel Cotto in 2009. \nThe gulf in experience between the two fighters is reflected in their ages — Horn’s 28, Pacquiao 38 — and it’s raised questions over whether the Australian is ready for the step up in class. \nHorn is unequivocal that he’s earned his shot. Pacman may fight in Australia 0:34 \n“I couldn’t even tell you the amount of top 15 opponents I’ve fought in my last fights,” Horn said. “They’ve all been pretty high quality and I’ve fought some high-skill guys, some pressure-fighting guys ... I feel like I’ve versed all the styles. \n“I might not have versed as many as Pacquiao because my experience is not as much as him, but between age and experience I feel like I’m catching him — we’re equalling out a little bit.” \nAs well as Horn, who only took up boxing due to being bullied as a child, feeling like he’s improving, the Aussie also feels like Pacquiao isn’t the fighter he once was. \nPacquiao has lost three of his last eight fights and has only fought sparingly in recent years — twice last year, once in 2015, twice in 2014 and just the once again in 2013.

I think I’ve got him at the right time as in I’m ready, I’m ready for this fight. I believe I can beat him.” \nAsked how life-changing a victory over Pacquiao would be, Horn allows himself to dream. \n“You go through little pictures in your head of what life might be like — on the beach or something. It all just depends. Life can change very quickly depending on a fight like this.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T12:30:05.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
