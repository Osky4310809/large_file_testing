In light of the company’s recent commitment to hire 10,000 refugees within five years in response to President Donald Trump’s disorganized and highly suspect immigration ban , Trump supporters are banding together to boycott Starbucks . In his letter detailing the company’s plan to hire refugees, CEO Howard Schultz wrote that hiring plan was in response to Trump’s immigration policy. As CNBC notes , many angry people are suggesting that Starbucks should only hire Americans or American veterans instead. In fact, Starbucks has a long history of hiring veterans , supporting them with various internal programs and honoring/spotlighting veterans that are employees or store managers. Since 2013, the coffee company has hired over 5,000 veterans as part of its dedicated veterans’ program. I hope everyone who is shouting #BoycottStarbucks remembers that they also have a commitment to hiring 10,000 vets as well by 2018. — William Prince (@thewillenium1) January 30, 2017 Schultz never wrote that the company does not or will not hire veterans. Because Starbucks operates in more than 75 countries around the world, some of the refugee hires will necessarily happen in other countries. Veterans looking for work would likely only be looking for jobs within the U.S. But former actor Scott Baio is still very concerned: Dear @Starbucks , why not hire unemployed Blacks, Hispanics, & Veterans? I'm genuinely interested in your reply. https://t.co/eL84mcDE4R — Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) January 30, 2017 As are other Make America Great Again champions: When . @Starbucks puts refugees before Americans safetyTime for me to #BoycottStarbucks Sales will drop from me alone!Stick 2coffee please! pic.twitter.com/kwKX49tCOB — ❤️MAGA Mama❤️ (@tteegar) January 30, 2017 #BOYCOTT …STARBUCKS CEO Puts Leftist Agenda Over Company Profits…Plans To Hire 10,000 Refugees In... https://t.co/stZGtDQ5Wz @3lectric5heep", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:57:08.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
