But sometimes it’s unpredictable in the best (or at least ,the most hilarious) way possible.\nCase in point: a guy bought an apartment in Queens and found something quite unexpected in the bathroom — a Mandy Moore mosaic in the shower . When a friend of a friend discovered the, uh, unique art installation in his new home , Peter Kaplan posted photographic evidence on Twitter because, well, you really do have to see it to believe it.\nThe mosaic replicates a photo of teenage Mandy Moore when the pop star was a staple in pretty much every teen magazine, and you couldn’t turn on the radio without hearing her tune “I Wanna Be With You.” walkerkaplan/Twitter After some debate over whether this mosaic was actually Mandy Moore, a person shut down the naysayers by providing Exhibit A — a photo of the bikini clad pop star that proves the previous owner indeed went through a great deal of effort to install art that is a pretty spot-on replica of the original picture.\nmy friend's friend bought an apt in Queens and there was a Mandy Moore mosaic in the shower pic.twitter.com/JtBZ2NBEX1 \n— Peter W.
