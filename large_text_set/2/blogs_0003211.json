Musk said that he and others on the council will take the opportunity to voice their opposition to the President’s executive order on immigration and suggest how it might be changed. \nMusk took the oppprtunity to specifically note that his being a member of the advisory group is not meant as an endorsement of the council or the administration. It’s likely Musk is feeling pressure from both within and outside Tesla regarding his participation in the council, espapebially now that former council member and Uber CEO Elon Musk has withdrawn. \nMusk’s full statement is provided below: \nIn December, I agreed to join the Presidential Advisory Forum to provide feedback on issues that I think are important for our country and the world. In tomorrow’s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy. \nAdvisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration. My goals are to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization, a consequence of which will be the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all. I understand the perspective of those who object to my attending this meeting, but I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good.
