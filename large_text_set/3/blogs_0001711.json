It’s all their fault.\nThen came a three-week federal trial — this event had plenty of interpreters — to decide who, if anyone, should provide an accommodation for the deaf.\nWhack! An Orlando jury ruled that the college, run by The Villages Charter School, had to provide interpreters for the deaf in a trial that “probably cost millions” to defend, according to one of the winning lawyers.\nJurors awarded 21 of the 30 plaintiffs a total of $212,000, a different amount for each person who deliberately was denied help U.S. law requires schools to provide when accepting federal funds, as the charter school does. The jury wisely didn’t buy the poor-mouth whining that The Villages couldn’t afford it. That’s pretty much a joke in a place where the owners are fabulously wealthy.\nThis is the second time that some arm of the giant retirement community that sprawls across three counties has lost a fight with the deaf simply asking for what federal law says they can have — a way to participate, like everybody else. The first dispute involved getting closed captions on the developer’s television station.\nDo The Villages developers hate deaf people? Or is this refusal to accommodate the disabled have its misguided roots in stubborn ego? Or, is it just faulty legal advice? After all, The Villages is a community of 157,000 seniors — how could developers think they could ignore the needs of the deaf and hard-of-hearing, whose numbers rise dramatically with age?\nThe Villages had offered nearly 500 noncredit recreational classes and lectures for some 18,000 residents through the charter school. Another round of classes was to start in January but didn’t. Instead, the school handed over the Learning College to the district government, which plans to offer classes in the fall.\nAll 30 deaf plaintiffs testified in the trial, said Andrew Rozynski of the New York law firm Eisenberg & Baum, which specializes in services for the deaf.\nHe said The Villages was informed that interpreters were needed, and “they just flat-out refused. They said it’s too expensive, and we showed evidence that they could afford it, and they were discriminating against our clients,” Rozynski said.\nThe Villages wanted the deaf to use Dragon NaturallySpeaking, a program that translates voice to text. However, the program is one that requires months of “training” by correcting errors before it works efficiently with any one person. The deaf filed transcripts of virtual babble showing that it simply didn’t work.\nPlaintiff Louis Schwarz, a deaf lawyer who lives in The Villages, said in an email that “our rights for effective communication were vindicated. For years we were told we were not entitled to have an interpreter but now a jury our of peers has decided that we do have that right and that we were intentionally discriminated against.\n“The case really felt like David vs. Goliath, and I am so happy we won,” he said.\nNeither Charter School Director of Education Randy McDaniel nor its attorneys returned emails asking about the trial and whether the school will appeal.\nNo matter. It’s time to look ahead, anyway. The district that runs the government in the community is taking over the Lifelong Learning College. An agenda on its website shows that among the “Next Step” proposals outlined in a January meeting is a discussion of considerations for disabled people.\nReally, there’s nothing to talk about. These deaf people are Villagers. The district should provide interpreters and end this shameful discrimination permanently.\nLritchie@orlandosentinel.com.
