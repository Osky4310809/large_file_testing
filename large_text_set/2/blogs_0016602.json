While details about the show are pretty scarce as of now, we do know that our favorite foursome, Will Truman, Grace Adler, Jack McFarland, and Karen Walker, will be back. On Friday, Sean Hayes (Jack) shared a nostalgia-filled photo from a recent shoot for the revival. \"Hanging with these beautiful people today for the #WillAndGrace photo shoot. @meganomullally #ericmccormack,\" he captioned the snap. While we kinda wish they would release teaser videos on par with their epic 2016 reunion , this will definitely tide us over until then. Also, all that vodka has done Karen (Megan Mullally) gooood.
