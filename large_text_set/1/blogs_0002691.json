Scott Applewhite) \nIn anticipation of the release of a report commissioned by President Obama, the top brass of the United States intelligence community appeared before Congress on Thursday to testify that the Russian government interfered in the election campaign last year. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper declared, “This was a multifaceted campaign. So the hacking was only one part of it, and it also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news … whatever crack, fissure, they could find in our tapestry … they would exploit it.” It’s pretty dramatic stuff. \nThe report will be provided to President-elect Donald Trump over the weekend, and members of Congress will be briefed next week. They plan to release an unclassified version to the public as well, but details are already being leaked to the news media. Trump was not amused: How did NBC get \"an exclusive look into the top secret report he (Obama) was presented?\" Who gave them this report and why? Politics! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nApparently, he is unfamiliar with the time-honored Washington practice of leaking, but he’d better get used to it. \nThere is plenty of skepticism about the intelligence community’s conclusions from all sides of the political spectrum. Trump is dismissing it out of hand. Most of the Republicans are keeping their powder dry, although hawkish Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham seem convinced, as do most Democrats. After the experience of last decade with the WMD analysis prior to the invasion of Iraq, many people on the left are naturally suspicious of the intelligence agencies. \nIt’s probably a good time to revisit that episode and remind ourselves of how that unfolded. Seymour Hersh’s original New Yorker article, “The Stovepipe,” exploring how that went down, still holds up today. The intelligence agencies got it wrong, for sure. But there was a specific reason: \nWhat the Bush people did was dismantle the existing filtering process that for fifty years had been preventing the policymakers from getting bad information. They created stovepipes to get the information they wanted directly to the top leadership. Their position is that the professional bureaucracy is deliberately and maliciously keeping information from them. \nThis was why the left championed truth-tellers deeply enmeshed in the Republican establishment and intelligence community, like Ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife Valerie Plame, when they boldly stepped up. \nAs I wrote here earlier , this wasn’t the first time the right had been unhappy that the intelligence didn’t show them what they wanted. The pattern goes back decades. In this case nobody has yet made a decent case explaining why the intelligence community would make this argument about a Russian attempt to undermine our election if they didn’t have good evidence for it. They are concerned with cyberattacks, to be sure, and like all bureaucracies they undoubtedly want more money and power to pursue them. But they don’t need to make this about Russia to make their case, and it is certainly not in their interest to make an enemy of Donald Trump. They could be wrong, of course. But they have no rational reason to make this up, which suggests that they are genuinely convinced by their evidence. \nIt’s easy to understand why Trump is reluctant to accept that the Russian government might have interfered in the election on his behalf. It just doesn’t look right for a super-tough, macho candidate to be the favorite of a country that many people consider to be a rival. Needless to say, a man with his ego cannot admit that anything but his own personal greatness brought him victory. (Yes, for all we know, Trump is in hock to Russian banks up to his eyeballs or just loves Vladimir Putin for his strength and manliness. He is a enigma on this issue for sure.) \nBut there is a factor that looms large in this story that may simply explain some of Trump’s behavior: Gen. Michael Flynn. Flynn is Trump’s eyes and ears when it comes to the intelligence community. The president-elect literally knows nothing about how it works, and there’s is no evidence that he’s spent any time trying to learn about it. He has said he doesn’t need daily briefings and seems to have outsourced that to his trusted aide Flynn. And Flynn is an angry man with a major ax to grind. \nThis story by Dana Priest in the New Yorker told the story of Flynn’s brief checkered career as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, in charge of all military attachés and defense-intelligence collection around the world. He had come into the job after some years on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan having had success as a clandestine officer, creating new ways of using disparate pieces of information to target suspected terrorists. He was seen as undisciplined and somewhat reckless, but his mentor, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, had understood how to keep his quirkier personality traits under control. \nThen he got the big promotion and made a hash of it almost immediately, creating irrational and impractical changes and behaving erratically on the job. He sought out the D.C. spotlight but apparently became lured into the right-wing fever swamps and started spouting outrageous falsehoods in public — including Islamophobic conspiracy theories — which his subordinates called “Flynn facts.” And he started to manifest a serious anger management problem. The agency had to create what Priest called a “parallel power structure” to keep the place running properly. After 18 months of this, Flynn was fired — by James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, who is now leading the charge on the Russian hacking story. According to Priest, Flynn was “livid.” \nWhen Trump started getting classified briefings, Flynn accompanied him. It has been reported that four different sources say he became unruly and repeatedly interrupted he briefers, challenging their facts to the point where New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who was also in the meeting, had to tell him to calm down. Flynn’s response when asked about it was that the story was “total bullshit … they’re lying.” He is clearly still angry and convinced that his “Flynn facts” are correct. \nFlynn may have an ally in another important Trump administration figure, Steve Bannon, who is associated with the “alt-right” movement, in which Russia has become increasingly important and Vladimir Putin is often seen as a sympathetic figure. Bannon has a special affiliation with Russian history, however superficial and insincere. It’s entirely possible he would back Flynn’s denunciation of intelligence analyses for his own purposes, lending Flynn even more credibility with Trump. \nAll of this is “Kremlinology” of course — meaning that a certain amount of guesswork is involved, since trying to sort out what’s really going on requires reading between the lines. But there’s a reason why Trump is so adamant that the intelligence agencies are wrong, and that he knows things they don’t know. And there’s really only one person in his close circle who would be telling him such things. If there was ever a president who needed a steady hand to guide him on these important, delicate matters, it’s Donald Trump. Too bad the man he’s leaning on is Michael Flynn. \nHeather Digby Parton, also known as \" Digby ,\" is a contributing writer to Salon.
