It’s funny, it’s visually impressive, it features Kimmel in a very 1980s high school band uniform awkwardly holding a clarinet…basically, it’s everything we could ever want from 60 seconds of heavily-branded entertainment.\nWe especially love that, while most of the celebrities just make jokes at their own past appearance’s expense, Davis — easily one of the best, most inspirational celebrity speakers in the game — is able to make us believe in the power of our dreams again within, like, six seconds.\n“The point is, all dreams are within reach, all you have to do is keep moving towards them,” she says in her smooth, comforting voice.\nIs anybody else suddenly applying for grad school? And also maybe considering buying a car?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:23:49.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
