Presumably Byrne was readying the stage show and didn't realise that his Vimeo account, although private, could be found on Google. \nFrom there, it was just a matter of time until the tracks leaked. Another Reddit user, mrmoosechill, tried out passwords on the video and found that several unreleased Gorillaz songs could be listened to using the password \"2017.\" \nThe band eventually figured out that that multiple tracks for the upcoming album had leaked, and the Vimeo account was removed. \nBusiness Insider was not immediately able to confirm that the songs were authentic, but fans believe they are the real deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T12:58:50.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
