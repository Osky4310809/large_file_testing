The victim reported that a suspect, later determined to be a juvenile, exited from the passenger side of the pickup and pointed a firearm at him while demanding his property.\"\nThatâ€™s when police say the jogger pulled a gun from his backpack and opened fire on the armed robber. He hit the robber at least once somewhere in the crotch. Officials wouldn't say exactly where in the crotch the robber was hit.\n\"We are not going to get that specific on injuries,\" Christopher Cook, Arlington Police Department spokesman, told the Washington Free Beacon .\nThe robber then fled the scene in the pickup truck which police later recovered. A suspect was later arrested and transported to the hospital. He was treated for a gunshot wound and then transported to a juvenile detention facility.\nThe intended victim of the robbery has not been charged with a crime but his case will be reviewed by the local district attorney.\n\"The victim was not licensed to carry a CONCEALED handgun,\" Cook said. \"Texas law does allow the openly carry of firearms. He was carrying the handgun in a backpack. Investigators have not charged the victim with an offense. It will be referred to the Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney's Office.\"\nThe post Armed Robber Shot in Crotch by Armed Jogger appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:56:22.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
