And that is what the festival, which began in 1987, is about. Lafayette will welcome an estimated 300,000 revelers over five days, April 26 to 30, with the peak attendance on Friday and Saturday. The music will include zydeco along with its antecedents and influences from Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and Southeast Asia. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story So maybe the “let’s dance” mind-set is in the blood of Louisiana, a state with a long tradition of music and partying. The breakfast I witnessed was at the tiny Café des Amis, which closed late last year for renovations. So Buck & Johnny’s , a block or so away, quickly stepped up to host the breakfast every Saturday morning, year round. “It was important to Breaux Bridge that we keep the tradition going,” said Coatney Raymond, the managing partner of Buck & Johnny’s. “We weren’t doing breakfast before, so we had to develop a menu, and it’s turned out to be really popular. Our specialty is Italian, so we have things like the Ti-Na-Na, a special pizza with boudin sausage, along with a crawfish étouffée grits dish.” Efforts were also made to cool the dance floor by tinting the windows and adding large ceiling fans. “Zydeco is part of our culture, and we want to make sure everyone who comes in has a great time,” she said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Having a good time was certainly the theme when I attended, whether the dancer was young or old, native Cajun or Creole, tourist or Gulf oil-rig worker maximizing shore leave. Dancing veterans favored cowboy boots — their leather soles and heels suited for the two-steps and waltzes of zydeco.

And the shirts — some western-style, some polo-style, a couple had Hawaiian prints, and there were T-shirts with logos celebrating the Allman Brothers Band and the Doors, the Long Beach Yacht Club, the Museum of Modern Art and Northeastern University. Andy Miles, an oil worker who said he was “Cajun, Creole, Indian, Yankee, Italian and West Indian,” was visiting for the third time. Recognizing several other regulars, he ordered a double bourbon before joining them on the dance floor. \nAdvertisement Matt and Dana Segraves of New Orleans brought their daughter, Louisa, to her first zydeco breakfast. Only 18 months old, she, too, soon joined the dancing. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story I had been tipped to the breakfast tradition a couple of days earlier by Scott Feehan, then president of the festival and now its executive director, while I accompanied him as he directed the crew in final preparations. He rode around downtown Lafayette in a golf cart, fielding phone calls and troubleshooting. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Though the festival’s full-time staff is only four people, with two seasonal additions, as festival time approaches they are joined by more than 2,600 volunteers. Mr. Feehan, whose day job is centered on his shop Scott’s Drum Center and the lessons he gives, is a native of the area, fluent in French and the music. While I was with him, he dealt with a concern over whether Scotch whisky had been ordered for the drink booths and with a panic about the estimated arrival time for the drums at the main stage — all while providing an escort for the truck pulling an office trailer to its temporary home in a parking lot. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The festival began, Mr. Feehan explained, as part of an effort to revitalize Lafayette’s downtown. Like many midsize cities (population: 121,000), it was moribund by the mid-1970s. The plan was to work with other Francophone entities in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Europe. Sister-city agreements were reached, business and trade agreements were made, and sponsors were found so that attendance at the festival would be free. And the music and dancing began. By 2011, the crowd estimate was up to 300,000. And downtown Lafayette was once again vibrant year-round, with restaurants, clubs, art galleries and the kinds of retail businesses, such as shoe stores, that once defined city life. “In the festival’s first 10 years, downtown was rebuilt,” Mr. Feehan said. Official guests this year will represent 25 countries. Though a visitor might not be surprised to hear French as well as English, a keen ear could pick up accents that go beyond the native Cajun and Creole, possibly including dialects from Africa, Belgium, Cap d’Antibes, the Caribbean, Paris and Southeast Asia. Louisiana has long had a reputation for great music, starting with the ragtime and jazz of the late 1800s, all of it heavily influenced by Acadian and Creole backgrounds. Acadian — Cajun — brought in the European accordion, a frequent element of the emotion-laden French chanson, or song. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The Creole contribution included blues and its call-and-response tradition from Africa. The party tradition goes back about a century, as the Creole people living in rural Louisiana set up “house dances” on Friday and Saturday nights. Furniture would be moved back and a two-person band — accordion and washboard — would be recruited to provide the music. The dancing would often go until daybreak. Photo Martin Accordions. Credit Shawn Fink for The New York Times Everything came together with American make-do spirit, perhaps best exemplified by the frottoir, a Creole invention developed from the corrugated-metal washboard, and the primary rhythm instrument in zydeco. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Herman Fusilier, who writes about entertainment and hosts a Saturday afternoon radio show called “ Zydeco Stomp ” on the local NPR affiliate, KRVS, points out that the instrumentation strikes many as unusual. “It takes a lot of people by surprise — an accordion used in music that sounds like blues, soul, rhythm and blues, even rap these days,” he said. “But it’s a big part of the music around here now.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
