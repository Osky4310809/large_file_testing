It's FREE and always will be! \nA 2-year-old boy is being called a hero after saving his twin brother, who got pinned under a dresser that fell on top of him. \nThe scary incident occurred when the two boys were playing in their bedroom. One of the boys tried to scale the chest of drawers. He climbed into an open drawer and began to try and climb up, but the chest of drawers could not bear the little boyâ€™s weight so it fell backwards onto him, pinning him underneath. \nSeeing his brother harmed and trapped, the twin brother sprung into action. In the full video, the boy is pinned for a minute and a half before his brother figures out how to free him. Eventually, the little boy tries to lift the chest of drawers by himself, and succeeds in freeing his brother! \nThe moment was caught on a surveillance camera and a short clip of the boy freeing his brother can be seen below. \nThe little boy was very lucky he was not seriously hurt and that he had his brother there to help him. Sadly, this kind of accident that claims the life of roughy one child every two weeks!
