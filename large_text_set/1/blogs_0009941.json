The fight over the painting mirrors an imbroglio two years ago over Confederate symbols around the Capitol, which many Democrats sought to remove . In response, the architect removed all the state flags that hung in another House hallway — some of which featured Confederate images — and replaced them with state coins. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The painting battle, coming as President Obama gave his parting remarks to the nation and as Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the choice for attorney general, defended his civil rights background in a Senate hearing room, felt like Chapter 2, or maybe 12, of the novel that will eventually be written about this particular political epoch. “It’s the dawning of a new era,” said Representative G. K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina and a former leader of the black caucus. “There are depictions of Confederate soldiers around this Capitol, but we didn’t take them down.” But House Republicans, who discussed the fate of the painting in two meetings over the past week, beg to differ. “The United States Capitol is not a modern art museum,” said Joe Kasper, the chief of staff for Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, who first removed the painting last Friday, dropping it off at the office of Mr. Lacy, who represents the student artist. Photo People gathered to look at the painting, which appears to depict the stormy events after the fatal 2014 shooting of Michael Brown by the police. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Mr. Lacy hung it back up, an exercise since repeated with various other Republican lawmakers. (Mr. Hunter is often a newsmaker. This month, he aided in a nearly successful effort to shut down a congressional ethics office that had recently examined his spending on air transport for a family’s pet rabbit.) If the architect’s office does not remove the painting, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, is all but certain to make the final move through the House Office Building Commission, which is controlled by the party in power and can overrule the architect’s office. “The painting is insulting to police officers,” said Mr. Reichert, who added that he had lost friends in the line of duty and been stabbed once himself. He called Mr. Clay, he said, to see if an alternative artwork could be chosen, but Mr. Clay did not follow up. “There were a few members who decided to take action on their own,” Mr. Reichert said, “but I have pursued this common-sense adult route.” Mr. Clay and Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, sent their own letter to Mr. Ryan asking him to leave the work in place. “In America, we don’t arrest artwork,” they wrote. (Tidbit: The artwork from Mr. Ryan’s district is an ink drawing of the young Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai , called “You Must Be Brave.”) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story On Wednesday, lawmakers and visitors traipsed through the hallway, stopping to glance at the St. Louis piece. One worker for the architect’s office, pulling a garbage bin, stopped to take a photograph of it. “I have Capitol police who are really good friends,” he said. “This artwork speaks to me as a black man. I think sometimes the truth hurts.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T04:02:58.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
