This comes days after Tyga , also newly-coiffed, shared with the masses his new style, which drew similar criticism online. Now the internet is battling to decide who’s rocking the worst of the two hairdos. \nPutting on his usual gold-tooth grimace, Kodak shared a photo of what he refers to as the “#KodakFade” after slicing his signature “#KodakKnots” down in favor of the look. While the front of the style appears to be your standard issue fade, it was the decision to leave a lone “Kodak knot” in the back that turned the heads of people tuning in. Fans at a recent show in Richmond, Va. got an up-close look at the fade and tail combo in action. \n“This Ain’t A Boosie Fade Fuck Nigga This A #KodakFade #Trendsetter I Keep Something New Going On … I Cut The #KodakKnots,” reads Kodak’s caption to the photo.
