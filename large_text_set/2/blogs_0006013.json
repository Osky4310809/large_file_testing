Mrs. Cecilia Ezeilo, told the minister that in the face of the dilapidating federal roads infrastructure in the South-East region, the people continued to suffer untold hardship. \nFashola, in Enugu to inspect some federal roads, stated that the Federal Government had assessed claims by state governments and had concluded arrangements to refund the money through bond. \nThe minister shed more light on the Enugu government intervention on federal roads. He said: “We have also been briefed about your intervention on certain roads that are our roads and I and your Commissioner have discussed about the outstanding claim from the Federal Government, and my message from the Federal Government is that we have completed the assessment of all these claims and the total amounts owed the states far exceed the total amounts as to the whole country. \n“The plan of the Federal Government is to issue bond to pay those money and then we pay the bond back overtime.” \nHe urged Enugu State government to assist the contractors working on federal roads in the state to secure the right of way, informing that they had been re-mobilized to site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:29:31.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
