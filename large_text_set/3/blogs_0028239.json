Hon. Victor Olabimtan, a former Director-General of his Campaign Organistion in a text message to Saturday Vanguard stated, “the Governor is a friend to all religions and has made it abundantly clear that he will be fair to all according to his oath of office.” \nOlabimtan, who was once Speaker of Ondo State House of Assembly during the Olusegun Agagu administration, pacified the agitating Muslims saying that: “In the recent appointments, three prominent well known Muslims were among those appointed. More Muslims will be appointed in subsequent ones.” Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN \nMeanwhile, Chief Imam of Owo and Secretary-General, League of Imams and Alfas, South West, Edo and Delta, Sheikh Ahmed Aladesawe, exonerated the League from blame over the alleged marginalisation facing the Muslims in the state. \nHe said the problem was because Muslim groups in Ondo State refused to be united under the umbrella of League of Imams and Alfas and that it was the antics of politicians to deprive the Muslims of their rightful place in the political appointments in government of the state.
