This installment is a significant departure from the classic take on Resident Evil , and that's quite the gamble when you consider that Capcom had to front a lot of money to create this game. Without the safety net of continuing narrative arcs and known protagonists, it's really only the franchise name that could guarantee some sales.\nThat gamble has seemingly paid off. As part of an investors Q&A session , Capcom revealed that Resident Evil 7  has recovered its development costs. The exact figure wasn't disclosed, but its 3 million units shipped has canceled out whatever it took to make the game.\nBut that isn't all that Capcom expects to squeeze out of Resident Evil 7 . There's still a projection that it'll hit 4 million units shipped, as this is cited as an example of a game that has a \"continuous long tail.\" Also, DLC sales will contribute to the overall revenue, even though the bulk of it will be generated from the base game.\nHowever, this isn't to say that Resident Evil 7  is actually profitable  yet. Capcom stopped short of saying that. Resident Evil 7  was anchored by a fairly significant marketing campaign, and we don't know if that has been offset. Still, sales appear to be right in line with projections at this point, so it doesn't seem like anyone is disappointed with its performance thus far.\nThird-Quarter Consolidated Financial Results Conference Call for the Fiscal Year ending March 31, 2017: Q&A Summary (February 1, 2017) [Capcom]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:14:17.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
