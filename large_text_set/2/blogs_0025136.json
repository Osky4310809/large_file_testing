Let’s talk about Sunderland.” \n'Rooney still good enough for Europe' \nKoeman has, however, opened the door to a possible homecoming for Rooney in the past, with a boyhood Everton fan welcome back on Merseyside after 13 years in Manchester that have seen him become a record-breaking goalscorer for club and country. \n\"First of all, he's a great player - he's still not finished his career,” Koeman said in October 2016. \nKoeman: Rooney welcome at Everton \n\"I don't know what his situation is, I need to respect his situation. That's not my problem. \n\"Even if one time there is a possibility that Rooney is an option for Everton, I'd say 'yes, please'.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:39:48.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
