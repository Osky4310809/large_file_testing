It’s a position where Denver likely will add at least one player to increase competition. \nMarshall had a run-of-the-mill season in 2016. He didn’t make many splash plays to negatively impact a pass, and for the first time in three seasons failed to eclipse 100 tackles. He also was hampered by a significant hamstring injury that forced him to miss five games in the second half of the season. He finished the season with 52 tackles, eighth on the team. \nDenver hopes Marshall’s 2016 production was a blip, because it expected him to be one of its building blocks when it signed him to a four-year, $32 million extension in June. His 2017 salary is guaranteed. \nDavis earned the starting position opposite Marshall for the first time and led the team with 97 tackles. He impressed at times and made a few splash plays, but he had some struggles getting off blocks and keeping up with elusive running backs. \nDavis is a restricted free agent. The Broncos are expected to give him a tendered contract. \nIt’ll be intriguing to see if they give Davis a right of first refusal tender, which was $1.671 million in 2016, or a second-round tender, which was $2.553 million in 2016. The latter would require a team to give up a second-round pick to sign Davis while the former wouldn’t require any compensation if Denver didn’t match the deal. \nNelson plugged in well as a starter for Marshall. He specializes in pass coverage, but also showed his worth in run defense. Anderson is a hard-hitter, who contributed on special teams. \nDavis isn’t the only potential free agent. Dekoda Watson, a special teams stalwart who provides depth at outside linebacker, is an unrestricted free agent. And so is Ware, who presents a complicated decision. \nWare, who will be 35 at the start of the 2017 season, had back surgery to repair a ruptured disc in late December. Back injuries have been a problem for him dating back to his days playing for the Dallas Cowboys . He said he wants to play in 2017, but it’s not certain yet if he can recover. \nPlus, Denver doesn’t need Ware on the field as much and his production is deteriorating. Ware had career-lows in sacks (four) and games played (10) last season. Ray is ready to be a starter. Barrett is waiting in the wings. \nWhat the Broncos would miss is Ware’s leadership, particularly with Miller. It would be difficult to lose such leadership on offense when Peyton Manning retired last season and now defense in consecutive years. Both sides would need mutual interest and agree on Ware’s financial worth. \nDenver could seek an inside linebacker upgrade in free agency, but it’s more likely it will use its money on the trenches and seek other upgrades in the draft. \nAlabama’s Reuben Foster would be a great fit and a probable day one starter, but he’s the top inside linebacker in the draft and the Broncos likely won’t have a shot at him unless they trade up. Vanderbilt’s Zach Cunningham, Temple’s Haason Reddick, Florida’s Jarrad Davis and Ohio State’s Raekwon McMillian could be available fits when Denver picks in the first three rounds. \nLike running back, linebacker could be a position where the Broncos seek an upgrade on day two or three.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T03:33:34.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
