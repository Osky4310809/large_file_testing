She submitted some of them to five magazines that held regular competitions for young writers. To her amazement, four of the five accepted her poems and printed them in the same month of 1923. Soon, her poems began appearing in magazines all over the country. Barely in her twenties, she became a literary celebrity. \nIn a sensitive insight, Jacobson considers how Kaneko must have felt as she released her art into the world, and finds an analogy in one of her own poems: \nFLOWER SHOP MAN \nwent to town to sell flowers and sold them all. \nPoor lonely flower shop man. The flowers he cared for are all gone. \nThe flower shop man is now alone in his hut as the sun goes down. The flower shop man dreams of happiness for the flowers he sold. \nBut while the public shone its adoring attention on Kaneko, darkness was brewing in her private life. The man she had married — a clerk in her family bookstore — turned out to be a terrible, unfaithful husband. As Jacobson tactfully puts it, she “contracted a disease from her husband that caused her great pain.” To compound the physical agony, he forced her to stop writing. \nThe little girl they had together was the light of Kaneko’s life, but when she finally decided to rise from the pit of unhappiness by leaving her husband, she collided with further heartbreak: Japanese law automatically granted the father indisputable custody and Kaneko’s husband didn’t hesitate to use it — he declared that he was to take their daughter away. Bedeviled by debilitating bodily pain and anguished by the loss of her daughter, Kaneko sank into further despair. \nOne evening, after bathing her daughter and sharing with her their favorite desert — sakuramochi, a pink ball of sweet sticky-rice wrapped in a salty cherry tree leaf — Kaneko went into her study, wrote a letter to her husband asking that he let her mother raiser the girl, and took her own life a month before her twenty-seventh birthday. \nSTARS AND DANDELIONS \nDeep in the blue sky, like pebbles at the bottom of the sea, lie the stars unseen in daylight until night comes. You can’t see them, but they are there. Unseen things are still there. \nThe withered, seedless dandelions hidden in the cracks of the roof tile wait silently for spring, You can’t see them, but they are there. Unseen things are still there. \nThe grandmother eventually did get to raise the little girl. Jacobson offers a touching ending to a tragic story: \nEvery year on the anniversary of Misuzu’s death, grandmother and granddaughter would share a sakuramochi. Together, they remembered Misuzu’s kind and gentle soul. \nComplement the tender and touching Are You an Echo?: The Lost Poetry of Misuzu Kaneko with Wabi-Sabi , a lovely children’s book based on the Japanese philosophy of finding beauty in impermanence, and Little Tree , an uncommonly beautiful and subtle Japanese pop-up masterpiece about the cycle of life, then revisit this collection of children’s book celebrating great artists, writers, and scientists  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T17:11:49.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
