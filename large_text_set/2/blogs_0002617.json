Icamen   Dian Paula Vera Seranilla. \nMANILA, Philippines – Dian Paula Vera Seranilla’s fun-loving and outgoing nature radiates enough sunshine to brighten anyone’s day. Her positive disposition highlights her radiant beauty and infectious smile, making people around her happy. \n“Happiness for me comes in simple things. Eating food that I’ve been craving for, being with my family, shopping with my mom. I’m happy when my friends open up to me and it’s fulfilling when I am able to help by cheering them up and giving them advice,” says Dian, who is a senior at the De La Salle Santiago Zobel School. \nDian, the daughter of Seranilla Group of Companies CEO Steve Seranilla and Prim8 Media’s Edna Seranilla, takes the lessons she learned from her parents to heart. “My dad is very supportive in everything my siblings and I do. For him, as long as we are happy, he is happy, too. He always says to just be myself and pursue what I love doing,” shares Dian. “It is through Mom that I learned that an ‘Oh well’ is better than a ‘What if.’ That means just go and do what you need to do. If you fail, at least you tried and you won’t have regrets for not trying.” \nA member of the De La Salle Zobel football team, Dian says that her love for the sport allowed her to see the world. When she was 13, she was selected to be part of a European tour — Spain, Denmark and Sweden — to represent the country in football. “It’s a different cultural experience for me. It’s like World Cup for kids. I was with my mom and some of my closest friends who were also part of the varsity team. That experience was priceless and that’s still the best experience for me so far,” she enthuses. \nThe travel enthusiast in Dian opens her eyes to the world’s majestic beauty. She considers New York as one of her favorite cities because of its diversity and artistic nature. But it was her experience as a delegate at last year’s World Youth Day in Krakow, Poland that gave meaning to her love for travel and meeting new people. \n“My experience at the World Youth Day was life-changing. When I travel with my family, it’s more of leisure. When I travel with my teammates, it’s for sports. But at the World Youth Day, that was my first time to travel for a religious gathering,” Dian shares. “The gathering was electric! Delegates wave their flags and they chant. They would take a picture with you and ask where you are from. You’ll see every culture present there and you’ll learn how Catholicism is in their country.”   \nDian wants to take up Psychology as a pre-med course. But this free-spirited beauty is keeping herself open to the endless possibilities the world has to offer. “My goal is to study abroad for college. I want to immerse in different cultures where I can be myself. And through that, I hope to see more of the world and be independent,” she concludes. \nPhotography by Dan Yusay Harvey • Makeup by Ria Aquino for MAC Cosmetics • Hairstyling by Avril Seguin • Fashion styling by Tara Subaldo • Gray dress by Kikay and pink and black jersey dress by Eric delos Santos • Shot on location at Hotel 101 Manila (EDSA Extension, Mall of Asia Complex, Pasay City.
