Victoria Stewart talks to three London-based cooks about what they cook to celebrate Monday 20 March 2017 14:22 GMT Click to followES Lifestyle Traditional kuku-ye sazbi Yasmin Khan \n)Today is significant for Iranians around the world, most of whom will be celebrating New Year, the start of a 13-day festival of spring called Nowruz. \nPredating Islam, it is an ancient Zoroastrian festival that has been celebrated in Iran for more than 2500 years, and, according to the British-Iranian writer and cook Yasmin Khan , is “like our equivalent of Christmas, when we get together with all of our family and enjoy a feast. Even today, 38 years after the Islamic revolution, Nowruz is still the major cultural festival in Iran. These ancient Zoroastrian traditions are central to Iranian society.” \nWhile rituals will vary from house to house, one of these often involves growing sabzeh - spring greens - and placing them on an altar, to represent new growth. \nIn London, ticketed food celebrations include The Parsee and The Persian, a dinner of Indian-inspired Persian dishes including Parsee-style masala chicken livers and grilled sea bass on herbed rice. Held at Cafe Spice Namaste , it will be hosted by chef Cyrus Todiwala and supper club host Afsaneh Kaviani. \nMeanwhile other celebrations will take place at home. Here, three London-based British-Iranian cooks share their favourite New Year dishes. Kuku-ye Sazbi, chosen by Yasmin Khan \nYasmin Khan is a British-Iranian writer, cultural commentator and public speaker who runs cookery classes and pop-up supper clubs. Her first cookbook, The Saffron Tales: Recipes from the Persian Kitchen was published by Bloomsbury in 2016, and she is working on her second. \nTell us about your dish: It’s a green fritatta, and it’s a very flexible dish - it’s very much about using what greens (sabzi means greens). The general ratio is always dill, coriander and parsley but I like to bulk it up with spinach, while other people like to add in chives, onions, or leeks. I like it quite simple with a bit of garlic too. \nThis would be a side dish on the table, because in Iran we don’t differentiate between starters and main courses, and we have a central meal with lots of different small plates. Iranian New Year is all about celebrating spring, and new beginings. The greens on the table represent renewal and rebirth, so we just have lots of these. My mum always makes it for New Year. The Saffron Tales by Yasmin Khan - cookbook review \nWhat does it mean to you? Nowruz is a festival that goes on for 13 days, and the 13th day is known as nature day, where many Iranians take a holiday and everyone goes off for a picnic with the whole family. During this national picnic, we take the wheatgrass that we’ve been growing and we tie knots in it which symbolise wishes. We then throw these into the river, and watch them float downstream with our wishes and hopes for the year ahead. \nAnd on that day, it’s also very common to have kuku sabsi. We might wrap it in flatbreads, have feta cheese with it, and also cucumbers and tomatoes, and it looks so lovely. My family are farmers from Northern Iran. [It’s a small rice farm], but we grow fruit and vegetables and herbs as well, so when I’m there with them, it’s a case of going down, collecting the spinach, parsley, chives and the garlic from the land, which is about 50 metres from my grandmother’s house, and then coming back and chopping it up. For me that connection with fresh produce and greenery is a huge thing that links me with my family. \nYasmin Khan's Kuku-ye sabzi recipe Persian nosh goes posh in London \nThis Iranian frittata is a sensational deep green colour and tastes like spring on a plate, bursting with fresh herby flavour. It is incredibly quick to throw together, will keep for a few days in the fridge, and can be enjoyed hot or cold. \nServe as an appetiser or as part of a mezze spread, wrapped up in flatbread with some slices of tomato and a few salty and sour fermented cucumber pickles, or add some crumbled feta and lightly toasted walnuts for a more substantial main. \nIngredients (serves 4 as a main or 8 as a starter) \n200g spinach", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:37:12.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
