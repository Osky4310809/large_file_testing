(Susan Walsh/AP) \nPresident Donald Trump appeared on Sunday to extend the timeline for presenting an alternative to President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act , in a Fox News interview that aired ahead of the Super Bowl. \nWhen asked by Bill O'Reilly whether Americans could expect a new health care plan rolled out by the Trump administration this year, the president replied that they were in the process and that \"maybe it'll take until sometime into next year.\" \n\"But we are certainly gonna be in the process,\" he said. \"Very complicated.\" RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Obamacare Enrollment Drops ] \n\"You have to remember Obamacare doesn't work,\" he continued. \"So we are putting in a wonderful plan. It statutorily takes a while to get. We're going to be putting it in fairly soon. I would like to say, by the end of the year, at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year.\" \nIt was unclear whether either O'Reilly or Trump meant that legislation would be presented at that time or whether they meant that a new plan would be implemented by then. \nTrump has said in the past that the details of a replacement plan would be presented to the public as soon as his pick for health secretary, Rep. Tom Price , is confirmed. While several replacement bills have been put forward by individual Republicans, the party hasn't yet unified on a specific measure. Because Republicans do not have a 60-vote majority in the Senate, they are limited in how much of the law they can undo and must balance the interests of insurers and medical providers. \nDespite negotiations over a replacement, the process for repeal has already been set in motion. After his inauguration Trump signed an executive order that allows broad measures to be taken to undo the law, and Republicans have put the process in motion for writing a bill that would repeal Obamacare.
