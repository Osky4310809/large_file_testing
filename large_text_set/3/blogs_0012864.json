A public safety spokeswoman confirms two bodies were found inside. \n“I always thought there was something weird going on with that house, being that the guy kept to himself,” said Michelle Douthett, who lives across the street. \nKDKA’s Amy Wadas Reports: \nIt’s not known just how long the decomposed bodies had been in the home. One neighbor told KDKA’s Lisa Washington, judging from the outside she thought the home was vacant. Another said she hasn’t seen the man who lived there in more than six months. \n“I’ve been here for about three years at least and I’ve never seen anyone going in and out of that house, never seen cars in front of the house, no moving trucks, so I’m actually pretty surprised,” Brittany Brown, who lives down the street from the home said. \n“I knew he was living there for a while. I never saw any lights on, but I heard a radio coming from it in the winter at all time. He had two dogs. I would see him take them out,” Douthett said. \nDouthett said the elderly man who lived across the street from her used padlocks on his doors. And she says, she hadn’t seen the woman who lived with him in several years. \n“I hadn’t seen her in a while,” she said, “and I figured she’d passed or something had happened, but I didn’t think that she was still in there.” \nThe mailbox at the home was filled with mail. Douthett said she told police a while back that she thought something was going on at the home. \n“I reported to an off-duty officer that I thought something was going on at that house and nothing really came of it. I guess they knocked on the door for a wellness check, and nothing happened,” she said. \nWhen KDKA went up to the side door, a sign from the medical examiner was hanging on the outside. Inside the house, inspirational Bible messages hang on the doors and appliances and clutter was scattered throughout the kitchen. \nNeighbors say they don’t suspect foul play. \n“I lived here for three years, there’s no roughness going on, nobody messed with them, they could’ve just died,” neighbor Shawnta Findley said. \n“They were just old, maybe things just happened,” neighbor Laurette Debold said. \nAnother neighbor Jayne Neel was shocked when she heard the news. \nNeel: “Me and one of the neighbor’s was talking about him like back in August. I haven’t seen him, that’s how long it’s been.” \nKDKA’s Amy Wadas: “Do you think he’s been dead in there since August?” \nNeel: “That’s the last time I helped him up the street with his groceries.” \nPittsburgh Police are handling the death investigation. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s office is working to identify the two bodies. However, it could take a while before that happens since one of the bodies was badly decomposed. \nAnyone with information is asked to call Pittsburgh Police. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter Lisa Washington Lisa Washington joined KDKA TV in May of 2015.
