Trump’s executive order on immigration is already taking in effect at America’s airports, where people from countries of concern regarding terrorism are being detained. Cortney has been covering the madness at JFK and Dulles airports. Virginia Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe said he would do all that he can to free those detained at Dulles. \nAt JFK, the Iraqi that was detained and then freed, Hameed Darweesh, had some nice things to say about Donald Trump, which our friend Jay Caruso at RedState captured . He said that he still believes that America is the land of the free, despite this incident—and that he likes Trump. \n“I like him, but I don’t know. This is a policy—I don’t know. He’s the president I am a normal person,” he said. \nDarweesh had worked with the U.S. Army. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) were able to secure his release, but as Jay noted, there goes the outrage factor: The man appears to be taking it all in stride, considering where he’s from Iraq. The people who are knee-jerking their way to a second Trump term already should take a lesson from this man. Stop automatically freaking out when Trump says or does something and wait to see what happens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T03:23:23.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
