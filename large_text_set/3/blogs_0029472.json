Peppa's teeth get pulled out, and distressed crying can be heard on the soundtrack. \nParent and journalist Laura June stumbled across the episode when she was looking for something for her three-year-old daughter to watch on YouTube. (Photo: smilekidstv/Youtube) \n\"Peppa does a lot of screaming and crying and the dentist is just a bit sadistic and it's just way, way off what a three-year-old should watch,\" she told the BBC. \n\"But the animation is like close enough to looking like Peppa - it's crude but it's close enough that my daughter was like 'This is Peppa Pig.'\" Read More Tubers Academy: School for aspiring vloggers turns kids' YouTube dreams into reality \nOther spoof episodes feature familiar characters from the Disney film Frozen, the Minions franchise, Doc McStuffins and Thomas the Tank Engine. \nWhile some of the videos use the characters in more innocent ways, others appear to be deliberately designed to trick children into watching disturbing content. (Photo: smilekidstv/Youtube) \nOne channel called \"Toys and Funny Kids Surprise Eggs\" has a landing page with a picture of a toddler alongside official-looking pictures of Peppa Pig, Thomas the Tank Engine, the Cookie Monster, Mickey and Minnie Mouse and Elsa from Frozen. \nHowever, many of the videos on the channel have titles like \"BABY HULK BITES BABY ELSA\", \"NAKED HULK LOSES HIS PANTS\" and \"SPIDERBABY CUTS ELSA'S DRESS\".

Some of the darker ones also depict violence and frightening situations. \nYouTube said that users can flag any problematic content by clicking on the \"...

YouTube also blocks search queries that are vulnerable to returning mature results. \nSince the BBC published its report, several of the channels highlighted in the investigation have been removed - including the one containing the video of fake Peppa visiting the dentist.
