It is a kick in the teeth for me and his other victim.” \nWinfield spoke out about his sexuality back in 2007 to a prison newspaper. In a letter to the Inside Time, Winfield claimed fellow inmates and staff were giving him a “hard time” because of his sexuality. \n\"Unfortunately there is a minority of staff and inmates that give me a hard time because of my sexuality, possibly through lack of understanding and empathy.
