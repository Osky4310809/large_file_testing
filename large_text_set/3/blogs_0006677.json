Here’s some front page news from Nov. 11, 1918: The war has ended. \nThis time jumping business is also dangerous as it is associated with increased risk of fatal car crashes, heart attacks and strokes, said Kenneth Wright, director of the University of Colorado’s Sleep and Chronobiology Lab in Boulder. Conversely, there’s a slight reduction in heart attacks when we go back in time in the fall. \n“This whole thing about daylight saving time, we have to question what the benefit of it is given that we know there are some risks associated with the change,” he said. \nBut a daylight savings revolution won’t happen overnight. So to get us through this war — that’s still going on unlike another certain war that got us into this whole mess — Wright offered these simple tips. Remember everyone, take this one battle at a time. “The first thing we need to think about is as a society do we really need to do this anymore?” he asked. OK, I may be harboring on this point a bit too much but this was legitimately his first piece of advice. Start going to bed and waking up 30 minutes earlier a couple of days ahead of the switch. Gradually dim your lights earlier at night to help reset your internal clock. Get out into the sunlight first thing in the morning to continue resetting that circadian clock. Wright suggested taking a morning walk. Be careful when you drive to work. The morning is already the most dangerous time on the road, he said. It’ll be worse with the added exhaustion.
