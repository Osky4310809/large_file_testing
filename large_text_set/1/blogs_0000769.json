France suffers from this more than most. \nAs the talent continues to stream across the Channel, it has created a situation where Ligue 1 clubs are having to turn to their youth systems more and more, which is giving talented teenagers a lot more playing time. Getty Images 17 Maxime Lopez is one of Ligue 1’s brightest new stars \nThe more they feature, the quicker they are linked with moves abroad – it’s the cycle of life. With that in mind, Football Whispers has highlighted seven wonderkids from Ligue 1 who will soon be on the radar of every top club in the Premier League . \nKeep up-to-date with all the latest transfer news and gossip ahead of the January window with SunSport’s daily LIVE blog . Maxime Lopez, Marseille, 19 \nBefore their new ownership gets a chance to boost the squad with January signings, the Marseille fans have been given a reason of hope in the form of 19-year-old attacking midfielder Maxime Lopez. \nIn the absence of Lassana Diarra, the youth product has stepped up and taken control. \nA classy passer, intelligence beyond his years and the vision to pick apart any defence, he has one goal and three assists in just nine starts and completes 86.8 per cent of his passes. \nThere will be new arrivals, but Lopez is the future of Marseille . Bank holiday Monday Premier League preview including West Ham v Man Utd Getty Images The 19-year-old attacking midfielder Lopez is attracting lots of transfer attention Malang Sarr, Nice, 17 \nEyebrows were raised when a 17-year-old was placed in the defence for Lucien Favre’s first Ligue 1 game in charge. \nBut 19 appearances later, with Nice top of the league, everyone in France now knows the name Malang Sarr. \nGood with the ball at his feet, he reads the game very well and is dominant in the air. Sometimes it’s easy to forget he’s still so young. \nPremier League clubs are already paying attention and that interest is only going to grow and grow. Getty Images Malang Sarr broke into the Nice first-team at just 17 Getty Images Premier League clubs are already paying attention and that interest is only going to grow and grow Kylian Mbappe, Monaco, 18 \nKylian Mbappe burst on to the scene last season, breaking Thierry Henry’s record as Monaco ’s youngest ever goalscorer. \nStrong and quick with the ball at his feet, the 18-year-old has the dribbling ability to dazzle defenders on the wing and the clinical eye to finish from anywhere in the penalty area. Getty Images 17 Kylian Mbappe broke Thierry Henry's long-standing Monaco record \nAlthough he has started just six times this season, he’s come off the bench five times and has three goals and five league assists, plus a hat-trick in the cup. \nHe’s shown ability to score with both feet, both inside and outside the box, plus something that Henry didn't particularly have - the ability to score with his head. \nMbappe has it all and it won’t be long until the vultures begin to circle. Getty Images Mbappe, 19, has blistering speed and strength beyond his years Getty Images Mbappe has been largely used as a super-sub this season for Monaco Allan Saint-Maximin, Bastia (on loan from Monaco), 19 \nIf Mbappe does leave Monaco, they already have a replacement ready to step in, playing on loan at SC Bastia. \nAllan Saint-Maximin is a tricky, pacy winger who started his career at Saint-Etienne before Monaco snapped him up. Getty Images Allan Saint-Maximin is owned by Monaco but out on loan at Bastia Getty Images Saint-Maximin is a tricky, pacey winger who started his career at Saint-Etienne \nA failed loan spell at Hannover followed but he has impressed since his return to France. \nCutting from outside to in, unleashing shots from distance, dragging defenders all over the final third, Saint-Maximin has scored twice and set up another double for a poor Bastia team. \nIt’s frightening to think about what he could do in a better side. What a load of rubbish! Clash descends into chaos Getty Images Saint-Maximin had a failed loan spell in Germany at Hannover but is flying in France Issa Diop, Toulouse, 19 \nJust in front of sensational teenage goalkeeper Alban Lafont, Issa Diop is his protector and at 19 years old, a leader of his Toulouse team. \nStanding at around 6ft 4in, he is a monster of a centre-back who dominates in the air. Getty Images Issa Diop is a teenage powerhouse in Ligue 1 Getty Images 17 Standing around 6ft 4in tall, he is a monster of a centre-back who dominates in the air \nHowever, averaging 4.1 clearances a game, for a team that is over-achieving, Diop’s reading of the game is one of the reasons Le Téfécé are doing so well this season. \nStill just a teenager, he leads and controls the back four. \nAfter helping France win the Under-19 European Championship he has naturally stepped up and is excelling for the Under-21s. Radamel Falcao nets hat-trick as Monaco thrash Bordeaux 4-0 in Ligue 1 Malcom, Bordeaux, 19 \nBordeaux under Jocelyn Gourvennec have not captured the imagination as Les Girondins' fans had hoped. \nOne bright light has been the promising displays of Brazilian wide-man Malcom though. Reuters Malcom is a box of tricks for Bordeaux Getty Images 17 Three goals and an assist early on showed what the Brazilian is all about \nThree goals and an assist early on showed what he was all about, driving in off the flank, running at defenders and testing goalkeepers from distance with both feet. \nHe has also shown great ability from dead ball situations. Mario Balotelli misses a late penalty for Nice against Lyon in Ligue 1 Reuters The 19-year-old is already a set-piece specialist Amine Harit, Nantes, 19 \nAnother member of France’s Under-19 European Championship-winning side, Amine Harit was virtually an unknown in the summer. But with Les Canaris floundering at the bottom end of Ligue 1 , the midfielder is earning rave reviews. \nAble to play anywhere across Nantes’ midfield four, in just his first few games in charge, new boss Sergio Conceicao has put a lot of belief in the teenager. Getty Images Amine Harit won the Under-19 European Championship with France Getty Images 17 Harit runs at defenders, draws fouls and drags the opposition out of position \nHarit has the ability and confidence to run at defenders, draws fouls and drag the opposition out of position. \nHe has shown no fear in his 15 starts this term, picking up his first goal recently against Angers.
