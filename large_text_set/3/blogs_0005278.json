It comes a day after another round of bomb threats against Jewish community centers and the Anti-Defamation League.\n\n“We write to underscore the need for swift action with regard to the deeply troubling series of anonymous bomb threats made against Jewish Community Centers (JCCs), Jewish Day Schools, Synagogues and other buildings affiliated with Jewish organizations or institutions across the country,” the letter says . “We are concerned that the number of incidents is accelerating and failure to address and deter these threats will place innocent people at risk and threaten the financial viability of JCCs, many of which are institutions in their communities.”\nThere have been at least 98 threats against Jewish community centers and schools in 33 states in 2017, according to the JCC Association of North America — a stat the senators noted in their letter.\nThe letter also calls on the Trump administration to to work with Jewish community centers around the country to determine what assistance is needed for enhanced security as well as investigate and prosecute those making the threats.\n \n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:42:55.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
