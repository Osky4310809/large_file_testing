Set aside to rest for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a heavy-bottomed nonstick 10-inch skillet, heat 1 tsp oil on medium. Cook the veg­e­tables till tender, 5 to 8 min­utes. Transfer them toa bowl and keep warm. Wipe out the skillet; add the remaining 2 tsp oil and heat it on medium, about 1 minute. Swirl the oil to coat the bottom of the skillet. Add the eggs and cover the pan. In exactly 2½ minutes, remove the lid. If the surface is wet but the eggs look set, proceed to Step 6. Still runny? Step 5. Put the lid back on, wait 30 seconds, and check again. Repeat this step as needed until your eggs are the consistency you want. Add the fillings to half the omelet. Run a silicone spatula around the perim­eter of the omelet and then fold the empty side over. Finally, use the spat­ula to gently push the omelet out of the pan and onto a plate.
