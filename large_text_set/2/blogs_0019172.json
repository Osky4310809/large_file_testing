Victor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images Wells Fargo \nThe bank fired more than 5,000 staffers over a five-year period after reviewing the credit card and checking accounts for which it \"could not rule out the possibility that an account was unauthorized.\" \nWells Fargo later expressed regret and said it would take full responsibility for \"any instances where customers may have received a product that they did not request.\" \nSloan, on the company's fourth-quarter earnings conference call last month, said the company continues to work to rehabilitate its image. \n\"We are leaving no stone unturned so that we can emerge from this a better, stronger company,\" Sloan said. \nThe executives listed on Tuesday will not receive a bonus for 2016 and they will forfeit all of their unvested equity awards and vested outstanding options, the bank said. \nThe board said findings are expected before its 2017 annual meeting. \n— Reuters and CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:59:21.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
