DIY Smartwatch Runs Windows 98 Portable Raspberry Pi PC Fits Into Empty Altoids Tin Celebrate Pi Day on Tuesday by building your own Raspberry Pi-based Game Boy emulator. \nThe nostalgia-infused project from Hackaday.io user Peter Barker (a.k.a. “moosepr”) is based on the Pi Zero and a 2.2-inch ili9341 TFT display. \n“So the Pi Zero is cool, retro gaming is cool, I’m really not cool, but I thought ‘what the hell,'” the project page said . “I’m not overly fond of ‘rats nest’ wires, and I have a bit of an obsession with making things as small as possible, so this is what I came up with.” \nNo bigger than a classic Game Boy cartridge, the mini machine includes a charge/protect board (“just make sure you get one with protection,” Barker warned), two navigation switches, and an attached battery for portability. \nIn a demonstration video (below), Barker shows off downloaded content like RetroPie and Sonic The Hedgehog. \nIn an effort to add sound without bulk, the developer repurposed old piezoelectric transducers—the audio devices hidden inside musical greeting cards (“designed to be as loud and annoying as possible from a tiny battery,” according to Barker ). \n“Sure it is a bit scratchy, and not overly loud (I think that is a bonus), but we have sound by adding just one more component,” he wrote in a recent update. \nBut an inventor’s work is never done, and in his quest to make things “as small as possible,” Barker is now testing surface-mount technology (SMT) transducers “that could be squeezed onto the board in a future design.” \nHackaday.io user moosepr\nHe also installed Pico-8, a virtual machine designed to mimic a “fantasy video game console” in a limited 128-by-128 pixels and 16-color display. \n“The screen is actually too big for Pico-8,” he lamented in today’s post. “But the little nav switches actually work quite well [and] you get used to their quirks.” \nGet a Raspberry Pi now and try on your own projects!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T08:34:00.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
