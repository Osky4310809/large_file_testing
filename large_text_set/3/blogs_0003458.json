But it's important in this case to finish the right way and try to win. Only if you win will people remember you.” \nChelsea take on West Ham tomorrow night, but Conte wishes he also had a Champions League fixture to look forward too this week. \nThe second leg in some of the last 16 games are being played on Tuesday and Wednesday night, including Arsenal's home match against Bayern Munich. Fabregas: Conte puts the word 'win' in our brain every day \nChelsea failed to qualify for the competition this term because they finished a lowly 10th last year. \nConte was hired to improve their fortunes and told Standard Sport back in August of his desperation to get them back into the competition. \nThe Chelsea manager revealed that it was made a top priority by owner Roman Abramovich too. \nWhen asked about Abramovich's demands, he added: \"We started our season trying to fight until the end to win the title, and to try and fight until the end to be in the right position to go into next season's Champions League. This was our target. Our target. \n\"But, for sure, it wasn't easy to start the season and know that six strong teams fight for the title and the Champions League. \n\"Don't forget, in this six teams, two won't play in the Champions League next season. They have to go into the Europa League, which is a bit different to the Champions League. \n\"But now this League is very, very difficult. To win the title and also find a place to play the Champions League is not easy. \n\"But it's a great competition for every single player, club and manager, and we want to stay there and try to fight to win it.\" \nConte's desperation to manage on European football's biggest stage only increased after seeing Manchester City's thrilling 5-3 win over Monaco last month. \n\"I watched the Manchester City game against Monaco live because I wanted to breathe it in, the right atmosphere, and feel this type of game,\" he said. \"In the future, also, I hope to sit and watch games live. \n\"I saw a great game, a great game. To see eight goals is not simple and it's not normal to find this.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T01:27:27.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
