Andros Townsend has made 27 appearances for Crystal Palace this term \nMbemba is currently away with DR Congo at the Africa Cup of Nations and has not played for Newcastle since October. \nPalace recently took Chris Samba on trial and are in the process of signing left-back Patrick van Aanholt from Sunderland. \nNewcastle, who also have an interest in Modou Barrow at Swansea, remain hopeful they can bring Townsend in on loan with a view to a permanent transfer in the summer. \nTownsend, who has 13 caps for England, initially joined Newcastle from Tottenham in a £12m deal in January 2016.
