No, I'm Not Sorry. \nSeventy-five percent of 40- to 59-year-olds said they'd engaged in risky driving behavior; 69 percent of those 16 to 18 — and those 75 and older — said that. The best-behaved group, if you can believe their own answers to the survey, is the cohort aged 60 to 74, according to the AAA: 67 percent of them said they'd done something dangerous behind the wheel in the past 30 days. \nThough texting while driving is a serious concern when looking at the data for younger millennials (they were twice as likely as all drivers to text behind the wheel), that age group's red-light-running was shocking. Nearly half of all drivers aged 19 to 24 said they had driven through an intersection after a traffic light \"had just turned red,\" according to the Auto Club. Fourteen percent of that age group said doing so was \"acceptable.\" \n\"It really stood out that millennials are running red lights after the light just turned red,\" says Elaine Beno, a spokeswoman for the Auto Club of Southern California. \"We're urging young drivers stop at red lights, don't text while driving and obey speed laws.\" \nThe survey did not break out data for Golden State drivers, she said. \nIt's not clear why millennials are taking risks while driving. Contemporary vehicles are vastly safer than in the past — a major collision is no longer a death sentence — and some can even drive themselves. It's possible that Americans who grew up surrounded by multiple airbags and collision-avoidance systems feel more comfortable taking driving to the edge. Of course, that's no excuse. \n\"Young people are driving in a much more complex environment,\" Beno says. \"They have the technology at their fingertips. But bad driving habits still lead to increased crash risk.\" Dennis Romero has worked on staff at several magazines and newspapers, including the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Los Angeles Times, where he participated in Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the L.A. riots.
