Advertisement \nCNN reports that Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson’s suit against the new travel ban will be joined by New York, Massachusetts, and Oregon. Ferguson’s suit points fingers at the words of the administration, alleging that “the principles of the order remain the same” and that White House officials have admitted that their “current motivations are no different than the first time around.” \nWashington state was the first to file a suit against the original travel ban in February, which resulted in the nationwide temporary restraining order that essentially shut it down. Speaking to reporters, Ferguson was crystal clear about his motivations. The messy rollout of the first travel ban produced a result that was xenophobic, extremely damaging and kind of illegal. The second travel ban, set to take effect March 16th, looks to be more of the same.
