Missouri corrections employees describe hellish work environments, incompetent leaders ( … ) \nA Missouri Department of Corrections photo of a prison in its jail system. \nJEFFERSON CITY • Employees within the Missouri Department of Corrections on Thursday detailed plummeting morale, burnout among workers and apathy from leaders unqualified to deal with the problems legislators are now tasked with investigating. \nThose problems include a rapidly growing number of sexual assault, harassment and retaliation cases brought against its workers – lawsuits that have cost the state millions in court, as first revealed by a report in Pitch.com . \nThe legal bill dating to 2012 is more than $7 million. \nDescribing a “good old boys” system where people are promoted to supervisory roles because of friendship or nepotism, Lt. Jason Horn, who works at the corrections center in Farmington, Mo., said a broken chain of command leads to a lack of oversight. \n“There’s a whole lot of passing the buck,” Horn said. \nTravis Case, an officer at the corrections facility in Bowling Green, echoed those concerns. \n“If you’re in the clique, you can move on up,” Case said. \nHe shared a story of a three-person interview panel who spent two days and more than ten hours vetting candidates for an open position as a secretary – only for the warden to intervene and handpick someone else he had a personal relationship with. \n“We know what that kind of a system breeds,” Case said. “This isn’t an isolated incident.” \nA cycle of undeserving people rising through the ranks – and owing favors to the those who promoted them – is one reason why so many incidents of racism, violence and sexual assault have slipped through the cracks, they testified to a House panel. \nHorn also explained that harassment cases are often submitted to Human Resources and sent right back to the prison system, citing “supervisory issues.” \n“If we can have somebody with an unbiased opinion come in,” he said. \nCase chalked the problem up to a vague harassment policy that gives leadership too much discretion over firing bad employees. \n\"If you don't want to, you also don't have to,\" he said. \"And that's where the favoritism comes in.\" \nCase said even for officers who are devoted to their work, \"it's like you're walking into hell.\" \nOther stories involved wardens cursing out lower-level officers, employees forced to work multiple 16-hour shifts and 19-year-olds being hired to work in dangerous environments to help fill the shortage. \n“That’s not a good idea, folks,” Horn said. “The only thing they had to worry about last week was what’s for lunch in the cafeteria and who is dating who.” \nOne problem that seems unlikely to be addressed this year is state worker pay – Missouri’s state employees are the lowest paid in the nation, but Gov. Eric Greitens is grappling with a budget hole that exceeds $500 million. \nLawmakers on the panel said they have been encouraged by the department’s newly appointed director, Anne Precythe, and her pledge to clean up the embattled prison system she inherited. \nBut in the meantime, the department remains unable to keep up with the turnover. Eight workers resigned just in the last two weeks at Horn’s facility in Farmington, he said. \n“This takes time … I understand the director's just getting her feet wet,” he said. “But we would like to see the ball rolling at our level.” Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nBe informed.
