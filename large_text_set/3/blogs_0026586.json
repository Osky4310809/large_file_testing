She said, I went to the biggest high school in the world, which is the Disney Channel. And my mom had a lot of history dealing with [bullying]. I heard her stories growing up. She’s very open about it. Giphy \nHer mother Mandy Teefey, who also serves as an executive producer and originally found the book in a Barnes and Noble, added, When I was growing up, I was always bullied because I was the outsider, the weird girl with the purple hair and combat boots. Then I was a teen mom. You get really judged. I had counselors telling me how I’d ruined my life, [Selena’s] life and how I ruined the father’s life, even though he participated. Gomez was just 15 when they started to option the story, but the now 24-year-old feels more connected to it than ever, especially after her 90-day retreat for health reasons.

You fixate on the [negative] ones. It’s like they want to cut to your soul. Imagine all the insecurities that you already feel about yourself and having someone write a paragraph pointing out every little thing — even if it’s just physical. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
