It’s also possible that increased volumes of intense exercise can lead to both physical and mental fatigue, which can cut your desire and motivation for sex. \nStill, it’s important to note that the study was done on men who already exercised—prior research has shown that increasing physical activity may actually boost testosterone levels for sedentary men. (Find out what happens when your body is low on testosterone .) \nThe problem, then, seems to be going too hard for too long. For example, 15 percent of guys in the study who exercised for more than 10 hours a week had a low libido, compared to just 2 percent of men who exercise for 4 to 6 hours. \nBottom line: If you notice your sex drive flopping, loop in your doctor, and make sure to let him or her know your gym routine.
