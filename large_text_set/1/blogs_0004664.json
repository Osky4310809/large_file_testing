Leila de Lima said alleged drug lord Kerwin Espinosa is not qualified for the Witness Protection Program because he is “the most guilty in the drug operations, particularly in the Eastern Visayas region.” AP/Bullit Marquez, File MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang defended Sunday the inclusion of alleged drug lord Kerwin Espinosa to the Witness Protection Program (WPP), saying it is but practical to protect someone who can identify other individuals who are into narcotics trade. “Well, the drug personalities who are in the upper echelons, these are the drug lords, those who are in Tier 1, if they are willing to cooperate with the government and you are getting information that can bring down the drug apparatus, it is just practical that you protect them,” Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar told radio station dzBB. “We will give (them) all the protection and the right because we can get a lot of information that can destroy the drug apparatus,” he added. Earlier, Sen. Leila de Lima, who was accused of receiving millions in campaign funds from drug lords, criticized the admission of Espinosa to the WPP, saying it was part of the administration’s effort to persecute her. De Lima said Espinosa is not qualified for the WPP because he is “the most guilty in the drug operations, particularly in the Eastern Visayas region.” She accused the Justice department of twisting the law and the Duterte administration of doing everything to destroy her because of her critical stance on the president’s war on drugs. Espinosa has accused de Lima of receiving P8 million from drug lords to bankroll her senatorial bid during the last election. De Lima, who claimed that Duterte’s drug crackdown has resulted in extralegal killings, has denied the accusation. Kerwin's father, Albuera, Leyte Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr., was killed inside his cell at the Baybay City sub-provincial jail last November. Police officials claimed that the mayor was shot dead inside his cell at the Baybay City sub-provincial jail while resisting arrest. An investigation conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation revealed though that the mayor was executed.
