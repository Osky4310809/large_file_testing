It was good to see them.” \nEven Jake, as diehard Mariner, admits his side are a “work in progress” but, he puts the result so perfectly into perspective. media_camera Jake, part of the Mariners squad. Jason Pratt Photography. \n“It’s not all about the result - yes, I’m disappointed that we lost but sport is just a game and the people who are connected to football are more important than just the game. \n“Seeing Arnie, Wilko and everybody yesterday just made it worthwhile.” \nHe adds: “They mean everything to me. Arnie (and Lawrie McKinna before him) and all the coaching staff have bene willing to give me the opportunity to do what I do today”. \nJake doesn’t just write for the club’s magazine, but describes his tasks around the club as “motivation and helping”. media_camera Jake Banks with the Mariners staff.

They’ve been amazing – I can’t thank enough for all the support they’ve given me.” \nIt’s a relationship Jake elaborates on eloquently in a moving opening blog written for the club in 2014, and how a school visit from the Mariners inspired further involvement. \n“So, how does a wheelchair bound person and a bunch of sports people become so important to one another’s lives? On that day at the school I was not treated any differently to my peers and I had the chance to lead the players around my school, show them our facilities and to feel ‘normal’.” \nHe continued: “Strangely enough by being there I felt as though I was part of the Mariners team and that my disability was irrelevant and not in the forefront of my mind. As time moved on and I was still attending the training sessions the players and coaches would come over and speak with me and ask me what I thought. I have to say that this made me feel so lucky and fantastic...that there wasn’t a barrier of metal from a chair between the conversation, that I am a person to them. It was here that my dream of working with the Mariners on a volunteer level started to come to life.” media_camera Jake Banks won Lifeline's 2016 Brass Bloke of the Year.
