In the future, they will only allow enrolled or pre-vetted passengers (or those screened by K9s) through the line. \nRelated: Everything You Need to Know About Global Entry and TSA PreCheck \nPassengers not enrolled in PreCheck have previously been ushered through in a variety of ways. Some passengers are vetted, risk-assessed, and allowed to pass through expedited screening on a flight-by-flight basis. \nWhen normal lines become too congested, the TSA sometimes allows travelers without a Known Traveler Number to pass through PreCheck. However the agency does not predict that tightening limits for PreCheck will affect line lengths at airports. \nThe announcement comes after the TSA added 11 more airlines to the program . A total of 30 airlines now participate in the program. So far 12 million people have registered for TSA PreCheck, which falls behind the agency’s goal of enrolling 25 million people by 2019. \n“TSA strongly recommends that frequent flyers (three or more round trips per year) enroll in a DHS trusted traveler program such as TSA PreCheck Application Program or Global Entry to obtain access to expedited screening when going through airport security,” the agency told T+L.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:18:10.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
