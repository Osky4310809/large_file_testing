Donald Trump is officially the President of the United States. While many people watched the inauguration live on TV, others chose not to for obvious reasons. The Big Bang Theory ‘s Johnny Galecki decided to do laundry during the inauguration , and we definitely don’t blame him .\nBecause laundry won’t do itself. Galecki stopped by The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Thursday night, and they discussed the looming event that has been on everyone’s mind: the inauguration. Specifically, the actor has been very outspoken on Instagram regarding his distaste for the 45th president of our country, and he makes no apologies for it.\n(And this was one of the least offensive / concerning comments of our new president). Well done, voters who didn't do any homework but only voted a recognizable name. And shame on the Hillary supporters who thought we had it in the bag and didn't go to the polls. I am heartbroken and extremely concerned for our country's future. Unfollow me if you feel differently. That's the very last of my concerns right now. \nA photo posted by Johnny Galecki (@sanctionedjohnnygalecki) on Nov 8, 2016 at 10:27pm PST \nMy previous post / meme was questionable in fact. Which has forced me to post the above much more recent and unarguable quote. I understand there are many viewers and fans of #TBBT whom are young and should not be witness to the sentiment I've posted. But they are not my words. They are those of our president, sadly. In fact, by law, I don't need to use any of the asterisks I did because our president used them. Crazy, but true and get used to it. And explain THAT to our children. I understand your frustration with Washington. But you elected a racist, misogynistic man with underage rape charges pending against him. Remember the golden days when we challenged Clinton of inhaling? It's easy to be successful and a recognizable name when Daddy gives you $14M and you (admittedly) don't pay taxes. #iexpexttobeauditedthisyear #ifnotdeported \nA photo posted by Johnny Galecki (@sanctionedjohnnygalecki) on Nov 9, 2016 at 6:58pm PST \nSo when Colbert asked him if he was invited to the inauguration, the answer definitely wasn’t yes.\n“I’m not gonna make it,” Galecki said. “Not as a dis or to be unpatriotic or anything, but it’s laundry day tomorrow, so that’s what I’ll be doing.” LOLOLOL\n“You’re welcome to come over and join me,” Galecki added. “We’ll do some whites.” To which Colbert joked, “I think all the white’s are going to be at the inauguration.” (So we obviously know where Galecki and Colbert stand.)\nGalecki posted a teaser pic on Instagram promoting his appearance on the show.\n“Airs TONIGHT on @cbstv,” he wrote. “Who better to spend the eve of our president’s departure with than #StephenColbert @colbertlateshow ? An honor / privilege / blast. @ringsmovie”\nA photo posted by Johnny Galecki (@sanctionedjohnnygalecki) on Jan 19, 2017 at 5:09pm PST \nCheck out the entire interview: At least we know one positive thing happened today — Galecki got his laundry done.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:04:24.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
