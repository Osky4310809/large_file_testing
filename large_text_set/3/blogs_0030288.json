PUBLISHED: 21:12, Wed, Mar 29, 2017 | UPDATED: 21:47, Wed, Mar 29, 2017 GETTY Guy Verhofstadt said Article 217 could be the best solution, meaning Britain may get great deal \nGuy Verhofstadt, Leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group, came out and said an association agreement between Britain and the EU based on Article 217 of the Lisbon Treaty “should be the best solution”. \nBut such an arrangement, akin the the one currently being ratified with Ukraine, could offer Britain “most favoured nation treatment” and a “privileged relationship” with the Eurozone. \nThis means Britain could be granted the most favourable trading terms available under EU rules.
