Google CEO Sundar Pichai is on Magic Leap's board of directors, and the people said that Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz loves to give demos to investors, entertainers, and other important figures. \nFor example, Beyoncé has tried the Magic Leap headset, Business Insider previously reported . Apart from celebrities, \"everyone in the valley has tried Magic Leap,\" one of the people said. Nearly everyone who tries the headset is asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement, although its unclear if Cook received a full demo. \nMagic Leap declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for more information. \nMagic Leap was put in touch with Apple through Allen & Co, a boutique investment bank, one person said. Abovitz and Cook both attended Allen & Co 's Sun Valley conference last year. Magic Leap has raised $1.4 billion from investors, valuing the company at $4.5 billion. \nMagic Leap gives demos all the time. Since a board meeting presentation seen as a major milestone in February, the company has shown its secretive technology demo to investors and potential content partners, such as the PGA Tour and other sports leagues. \nSo, a while ago I said that seeing Magic Leap was the coolest thing I'd seen since the iPhone. It's now much cooler than that. — Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) March 16, 2017 \nKnow anything about Magic Leap and its relationship with Apple (or Google)?
