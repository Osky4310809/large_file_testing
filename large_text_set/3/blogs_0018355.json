BRIT HUME: Are we to believe there was no surveillance associated with that? We do know, as you pointed out, that Mike Flynn was caught up in a wiretap that might be a routine national security wiretap with the Russian ambassador to whom he was speaking, but who knows? But remember, when he made this announcement, Comey, that there was this investigation going on -- which he said he received permission from higher-ups to do -- the announcement, there was a story back on January the 19th in The New York Times which basically laid this whole thing out and said it was based on surveillance that indicated that there had been these contacts. That story also said that it wasn't clear that the wiretaps had determined anything about the Trump campaign. So, we all kind of know where we are. And remember also this. This is supposedly a counter-intelligence investigation. That means it is basically a national security matter. So, what's up with that? What does that tell us about how likely they are to find out about political collusion? One wonders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:18:04.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
