California: Under The Command Of Clowns? Elitists running California into the ground are exempt from the repercussions of their own moronic actions.   \nThe Mercury News in California, a “ new left ” leaning news outlet, claimed in the caption of a photo regarding pending California Senate Bill 49, that “California should support Gov. Jerry Brown’s effort to build a green wall around the state.” \nCalifornia is arguably a leading example of political mismanagement of the resources of its people. Through the bungling of the State’s socialist-progressive politicians, California now faces several uber-monumental problems: \nA Financial Train Wreck: The Word You Are Looking For Is ‘Assimilation’ \nFirst of all, it’s ludicrous to suggest that California’s government is even remotely holding its own financially. \nThe fact is, California’s government is in an abyss of financial trouble, corralled with a $443 billion dollar wall of debt and sinking deeper! Being immersed in debt seems to typify the standard operating procedure of socialist politicians today, whereby being in debt seems to be almost viewed as a good thing, and going deeper into debt is now part of the progressive Democratic platform. Of course this only makes sense to socialists with a twisted logic that is related to their reckless mindset in regard to “other people’s money” and the stewardship of that money. And of course the idiotic concept of CALEXIT makes the list of dumbest ideas of all time, given the state’s dire need for federal support as well as the water from neighboring states. And it gets worse; if California Senate Bill 54 passes, California is at risk of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding , yet another hole in SS California. \nThe Ongoing California Water Crises:   \nThen we have the California water crises, which regardless of recent record precipitation has just begun and has been conveniently blamed on the normal historical cyclical nature of climate change on earth . The facts do not support the excuses that progressive Democrats like to cite for their water management and policy follies and failures. The California water system allegedly manages about 40-million acre-feet of water, and according to a new study from the University of California Davis (“ Water In The West “), even with normal annual precipitation, the state’s water system operates at a net loss of approximately 2-million acre-feet annually and that operating loss has not been materially changed by the recent above average precipitation. This means that even if California enjoys normal precipitation across the state for decades to come, it will continue to have less and less water available, as existing demand for water is unsustainable and growing due to failed planning and policies. Left as-is and uncorrected, there may very well be ensuing “ water wars ” in California. \nSo as the leftist operating manual, Alinsky’s Rules For Radicals, s uggests, why waste a perfectly good disaster? Gov. Jerry Brown has been busily beating his drum for even more money. And even after raising a $7.5 billion water bond, allegedly to build and maintain more dams and water storage, he has virtually done nothing since then except try to raise even more money for his Twin Tunnel project , which would arguably enable the “appropriation” of water rights from the folks in the extreme north end of California and southern Oregon . By aggregating and connecting the waters from the far north of California via the Sacramento River to the California Aquaduct using the Twin Tunnels, water could be transferred to Los Angeles from as far north as southern Oregon. The perspective on such a move by those who see through this nefarious plan is that it is an outrageous act. But, given the seemingly open door policy for harboring criminals in the “sanctuary state”, such an act may be within normal political parameters? “Honor among thieves,” right? \nSanctuary State – A Safe Haven For Criminals? \nThe liberal clowns that call themselves leaders and politicians are also putting forth California Senate Bill 54, which seeks to establish California as a so-called “sanctuary state,” offering safe haven to illegal immigrants (criminals and potentially terrorists) who break our laws by illegally infiltrating into California and other states. It’s an interesting side note that the 3 million illegal immigrants already in the state of California use approximately 109 billion gallons of fresh water annually.   Eric And Lara Trump Expecting Their First Child [Video] \nAccording to another politically slanted article promoted by The Mercury News: \nSenate Bill 54 is perhaps the Legislature’s highest-profile act of defiance against the Trump administration, which is seeking to enlist the help of local police to carry out its promised crackdown on illegal immigration. The proposal would prohibit local and state agencies from using state resources to communicate with federal agents, with a few exceptions — such as task forces involving federal and local agencies. \nUsurping The Constitutional Power Of The President of The United States: \nLast but not least is the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California, which Mark Levin has called the “9th circus of schlemiels.” Levin is an American lawyer, author, and the host of syndicated radio show, The Mark Levin Show . Levin worked in the administration of President Ronald Reagan and was a chief of staff for Attorney General Edwin Meese. \nAnd considering the rate that 9th Circuit Court rulings are overturned, Levin seems well supported in his observation of “schlemiels” on that bench given that only 20 percent of their rulings are upheld on appeal. \nThe Daily Caller also weighed-in on the 9th Circuit with this statement: \n“Eight of out of 10 cases from the 9th Circuit reviewed by the Supreme Court are overruled, according to a 2010 analysis published by the American Bar Association . The 9th Circuit, which is known for its liberal tendencies, has the second-highest reversal rate of the 13 appellate courts below the Supreme Court.” \nBut wait! It seems that there are at least a few level heads on the California based 9th Circuit. \nIn fact, in regard to President Donald Trump’s first executive order to help stop the infiltration of bad actors and terrorists into America, and the ruling made by the 9th Circuit to overturn the president’s order, a surprising condemnation of that ruling has been censored by leftist media outlets. \nBut there are those people fighting the good fight, providing real news: \nAccording to Dan Abrams at Law Newz: \n“ In one of the most ruthless opinions issued of fellow panel judges, five judges from across the political spectrum in the Ninth Circuit went out of their way to issue an opinion about a dismissed appeal, to remind everybody just how embarrassingly bad the prior Ninth Circuit stay panel decision was on Trump’s travel ban. The five judges included the famed, and most respected intellectual amongst the Ninth Circuit, Alex Kozinski. The others included Jay Bybee, Consuelo Callahan, Carlos Bea and Sandra Ikuta. Nobody other than the original panel came to the defense of the original panel decision, a less than promising start for future approvals of district court interference in Presidential immigration policy.” \nAll the while, the “new left” is currently fumbling at the political controls of the grounded and now sinking ship of state, the SS California. These clowns obstinately maintain they are right and everyone else is wrong, as they plunge the state head-long into a condition that seems to lend credibility to the premise of the movie Idiocracy as it applies these leftists and their progressive agenda. \nOf course the “new left” elitists who are essentially running California into the ground are virtually exempt from the repercussions of their own moronic actions, and do not suffer the kind of personal and financial exposure that is created by their so-called political leadership in California. Unlike the vast majority of taxpayers, they have body guards (with guns), mansions with fences and guard dogs, limousines, jets, and enjoy special privileges and rights, all the while making a fortune off of the backs of hard-working California taxpayers. \nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.
