However, take another look and Ryan Murphy’s new show isn’t going to be about murder. It’s going to be about backstabbing and sabotage instead.\nAdding to his ever-expanding roster, the man behind American Horror Story and American Crime Story has another new anthology series in the works: Feud . It will follow the real life stories of some of Hollywood’s most noted feuds between famous people. Yes, this is something we will watch, and you don’t have to ask us twice.\nThe inaugural season of the show will focus on the feud between Hollywood legends Joan Crawford and Bette Davis on the set of 1962’s Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. Susan Sarandon is playing Bette Davis and AHS alumn (QUEEN) Jessica Lange is playing Joan Crawfrod. Talk about a female-driven show for some powerhouse actresses.\nThis first tease for the series is a simple shot of the beach, showing one woman wandering away in the distance (in the world of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? that’s Jane) and the other who seems to be wrapped up in a red blanket in the sand (that’s Jane’s paralyzed sister, Blanche). This is an actual moment from the movie, and it’s the end of the movie.\n& From creator Ryan Murphy, see the horrifying truth behind Hollywood s most legendary rivalry. Feud: Bette and Joan premieres this March on FX Networks.\nPosted by American Horror Story on  Tuesday, January 17, 2017 Haven’t seen Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ? No worries. Here’s part of the scene from the movie that we’re clearly going to see recreated on the small screen (but obviously, spoilers).\n\nBut don’t think we’re just going to see some of the movie recreated via Ryan Murphy. He’s really taking us behind-the-scenes for the REAL drama that went down between Joan and Bette. They hated each other. And we can’t wait to watch the semi-real semi-fictional reason WHY.\nWe also don’t even have to wait that long for Feud . The first season hits FX on March 3rd. Mark your calendars.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:58:56.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
