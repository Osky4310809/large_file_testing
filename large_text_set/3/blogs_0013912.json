Around the election of President Donald Trump, some cities, but not all, saw significant spikes in hate-related incidents. Forty-three percent of 2016 hate crimes in Philadelphia, for example, happened in November and December. \n“We definitely saw an election-time bump,” Levin said. \nLevin also noted that anti-Semitic hate crimes are on the rise in 2017. There have been 55 hate crimes in New York City already in 2017, a 189 percent over the 19 hate-related incidents in all of 2016. New York City is home to U.S.’s largest population of Jewish residents, about 1.1 million people. \nHate crime data is notoriously difficult to track . Incidents often go unreported to police, and FBI statistics — which won’t be released until later this year — are based on a voluntary reporting system that some experts say police can refuse to support, meaning numbers are likely higher. \nLate last month, President Trump finally addressed the growing wave of bomb threats against Jewish community centers and anti-Semitic vandalism happening in the country. Jewish community centers across the U.S. have received more than 100 bomb threats since January. \nThe increases are “very significant,” so Levin doesn’t believe the spike can be solely attributed to an increase in reporting of hate crimes. The information “answers questions but creates more,” because it only accounts for nine metropolitan areas. \nOfficial FBI data for nationwide hate crimes in 2016 will not be released until November of this year. \nSee what's on VICE News Tonight on .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:07:15.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
