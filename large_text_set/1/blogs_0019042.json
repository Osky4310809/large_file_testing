(Photo: Preston Gannaway, Rocky Mountain News via AP) \nBarack Obama's presidential farewell address summoned up happy memories of the way minority groups have been treated these past eight years in a city that has not always been prepared for the faces of the future. I want to offer a few personal stories from my experience in Washington with my partner, Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado. \nWhen Jared was elected to Congress in 2008, he became the first openly gay man to run for and win an open seat in the history of our great country. The days of hiding one's identity to win votes were already disappearing. At the time, I don't think either of us understood the way this simple evolution would affect things going forward. There are more lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender lawmakers and staff, people with partners, spouses, and children. Congress is truly beginning to reflect the diversity of America. \nIn the early days of Obama's administration, our presence in Washington was quite a novelty. We were welcomed, if not always handled all that delicately. Many people, not realizing how funny it appeared to me, approached to say, \"I have a gay friend back home. He's been doing my hair for 30 years.\" Stereotypes are often perpetuated in the absence of personal contact. I never blamed people for trying to relate to me as if I were a caricature from a TV show, or a toy they found wading somewhere at the bottom of a cereal box. But I realized a responsibility to change these viewpoints while I had the opportunity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:35:23.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
