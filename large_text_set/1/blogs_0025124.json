Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \nThe 27-year-old, Birmingham's first world champion, is already eyeing up some blockbuster fights in a division full of quality and four-weight world champion Gonzalez, who is unbeaten in 46 fights, is also in his sights. \nSpeaking exclusively to Sky Sports , he said: \"I definitely want to fight Gonzalez in the future, he is one of the biggest names in boxing. Roman Gonzalez is a four-weight world champion and considered to be one of the pound-for-pound best \n\"He is a brilliant fighter, a four-weight world champ and pound-for-pound No 1. It's brilliant for him to be in my weight class and it gets our division out there a bit more. \n\"I don't fear any fighter and although there are big risks in that fight, I believe with the right experience under me leading into that fight - I know I can beat Gonzalez.\" Yafai defeated Luis Concepcion to claim the WBA world title \n\"I'm in one of the strongest weight divisions and every world champion is very talented, all our records combined reads something like 148-1, so I'm sure I'll be involved in some big unification bouts in the future. \n\"It's definitely hard becoming a world champion, but it's even harder staying at the top so I have to keep working harder ever than before from here.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T13:42:18.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
