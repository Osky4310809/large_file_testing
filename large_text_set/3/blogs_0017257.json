In a series of Tweets posted on Sunday, astrophysicist and TV host Neil deGrasse Tyson indirectly took on Trump's budget , writing that making America great won't happen until we make America smart again by increasing government funding, not by ignoring the scientific consensus on man-made global warming and slashing financial support for important programs that improve the quality of life for American citizens and ensure a livable world.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/843510463392616448\nhttps://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/843513652611231744\nhttps://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/843516171748069376\nhttps://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/843518683053940736\nhttps://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/843521200278069248\nhttps://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/843523716977905664\nhttps://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/843525981570662400\nhttps://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/843530014104592384\nTrump's budget boosts Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs while proposing deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (31.4%), Health and Human Services (16.2%), the State Department (28.7%), Commerce (15.7%), Transportation (12.7%), Labor (20.7%), Education (13.5%), Interior (11.7%), Agriculture (20.7%) and Housing and Urban Development (13.2%).\nRelated: Trump team claims funding climate change is “a waste of your money” \nThe budget would also eliminate or zero out programs including Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), which funds clean energy research; Global Climate Change Initiative; Great Lakes Restoration Initiative; Chesapeake Bay funding; National Endowment for the Arts; National Endowment for the Humanities; NASA's Office of Education; and TIGER transportation grants, a program included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that funds innovative transit projects.\nTyson isn't the only scientist taking action against Trump's war on science. The March for Science is scheduled for Earth Day, April 22nd in Washington, D.C. and cities across the country. The mission statement posted on the March for Science website calls for \"robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest.\"\nVia Huffington Post \nImage 1 , 2 via Wikimedia \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T11:34:27.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
