Trump’s administration imposed the measure, saying it was necessary for national security. \nThursday decision affirmed a lower court’s temporary restraining order that blocked the travel ban from being implemented. \nOn Saturday, federal Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, issued a temporary nationwide restraining order blocking the ban after it was challenged by Washington state and Minnesota. \nOfficials with the U.S. Justice Department, which argued on behalf of Trump’s order, say they are reviewing the appellate decision. \nRead the entire 29-page decision here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:44:57.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
