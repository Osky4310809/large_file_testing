And we were right! The star took to her brand's official Instagram to announce that she will be launching brand new matte blushes on Friday, March 24, at 3 p.m. Pacific time. \nKylie has yet to reveal swatches of her new cheek hues, but we can't help but notice how similar they are in color to her Instagram-famous lip collection. From left to right, the colors seem to coordinate with her Lip Kits and range in shade from muted mauves (like Candy K) to hot pinks (like Posie K). We can't wait to see the new collection up close and swatched! Watch this space for more details on the blushes as they emerge, and set your alarms for Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:25:22.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
