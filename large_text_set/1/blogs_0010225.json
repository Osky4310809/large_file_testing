What Customers Say: \"I love this nail polish. It is the only brand I will use. They have so many different colors, the finish is perfect, and they don't chip as much as the other brands.\"— R. Roberts Courtesy of Amazon OPI Nail Envy Nail Strengthener in Bubble Bath , $18 Star Rating: 4.5 Selling Points: Neutral-colored nail strengthener and color-corrector enriched with wheat protein. What Customers Say: \"A perfect two-in-one base coat, which is how I use it. With the help of an extra-wide brush and light, smooth formula, it glides on evenly and dries quickly. This is my new tone-correcting base coat.\"— Kittylvr Courtesy of Amazon Aimeili Temperature Color Changing Chameleon Gel Nail Polish , $7 Star Rating: 4.5 Things to Know: Soak-off gel polish, changes color with temperature changes, requires drying under UV or LED lamp, 14-day wear life. What Customers Say: \"I was so surprised that this gel polish actually worked! The polish is true to color and is so fun to watch the color change to pink when it's hot and white when it's cold. I will definitely be buying the other colors available!\"— Kora Courtesy of Amazon Smith & Cult Nail Polish in Dark Like Me , $18 Star Rating: 4.5 Key Selling Points: 8-free formula, long-wearing, high-shine. What Customers Say: \"This is the best polish I've ever used. It's creamy, goes on like a dream, and is super shiny even without a top coat. With a top coat, it's practically indestructible.\"— Jennifer L. Meyers Courtesy of Amazon Essie Nail Color in A-List , $9 Star Rating: 4.5 Selling Points: Award-winning brand, free of DBP, toluene, and formaldehyde. What Customers Say: \"I love Essie nail polishes the best of any of the brands I've ever used–and I've used quite a few. I think it gives the best coverage with the clearest pigment and best variety of colors available.\"— AP Courtesy of Amazon China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners in Afterglow , $6 Star Rating: 4 Key Selling Points: Long-wearing, chip-free, non-thickening formula. What Customers Say: \"For the price, it's by far my favorite brand. It's always smooth, never too thick, very opaque, and only takes one to two coats to get the coverage you need. It dries quickly, which is nice, too!\"— Chelsey Courtesy of Amazon OPI Nail Polish in A Good Man-darin is Hard to Find , $10 Star Rating: 4.5 Key Selling Points: Exclusive ProWide laquer brush for streak-free application, high-pigment color, award-winning salon-grade formula. What Customers Say: \"The more OPI polishes I buy, the more I'm convinced it's the best brand available. (I also like Revlon, which has similarly smooth formulas with good coverage and a large selection of colors.) I've never had an OPI polish streak, clump, or lose 'hairs' from the brushes (like with other polish brands), and the colors are rich and gorgeous.\"— Cat Lady Courtesy of Amazon Sally Hansen Big Matte Top Coat , $5 Star Rating: 4.5 Key Selling Points: Quick-drying, gives any manicure a velvet-matte finish. What Customers Say: \"Pretty good for a top coat that is not gel. Also, the price is excellent and shipping was very fast. Just as a word of advice for my fellow nail polish enthusiasts: Only use a thin layer with the three-brush stroke trick, and it will not bubble or look chunky.\"— Lisa Courtesy of Amazon Butter London Trend Nail Lacquer in All Hail The Queen , $15 Star Rating: 4 Key Selling Points: Award-winning polish line, high-gloss-finish, chip-resistant, free of formaldehyde, toluene, and DBP. Also fortified with calcium and vitamins E, A, and C and Pro B5. What Customers Say: \"The color is gorgeous. One coat of color coats with no streaking. I wear this with a top coat and it lasts weeks with no chipping.\"— Tin Ear Courtesy of Amazon CND Vinylux Weekly Nail Polish in Romantique , $11 Star Rating: 4 Key Selling Points: More than 100 shades, 7-day wear, fast-drying, polymer chip-resistant formula, gets more durable with exposure to light. What Customers Say: \"Most amazing nail polish ever. It's been over a week and there's no chipping; the formula goes on better than OPI, which is my favorite. The colors are better and the shine is great. Shipped quickly. The topcoat is a must and makes the polish last so much longer.\"— Anna Courtesy of Amazon Star Rating: 5 Selling Points: Fast-drying, vegan, cruelty-free.
