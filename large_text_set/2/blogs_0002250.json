Dropped. At this point in the ad, Adolphus finally reaches America where citizens tell him to “go back home” and shove him. Giphy \nThis type of xenophobia feels extremely familiar, doesn’t it? \nThat’s because the most recent immigrant ban ordered by President Trump is the purest form of that xenophobia, which also currently has the force of law. \nAccording to two law professors who wrote a piece on the unconstitutionality of the Muslim ban for Slate , the executive order violates the 1st Amendment, the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, Due Process, Habeas Corpus and Family Unification Rights. \nWhile the commercial was produced months before Trump’s executive order, it was not produced months before Trump announced his desire as a presidential candidate to institute a ban on all Muslims from entering the US. \nAlthough AdAge points out the “ad by Anomaly might be perceived by some viewers as making a subtle political statement, that was not the intent” and how Anheuser-Busch InBev executives only wanted “themes of hard work and the pursuit of dreams,” I can’t help but wonder how accurate that truly is. Giphy \nAfter all, the whole premise of the ad is an immigrant can face a slew of hardships and still accomplish great things while defying expectations of those who fear and even hate them. \nWhen Adolphus meets his business partner Eberhard Anheuser, you realize the promise of the American dream is based on the success stories of those who came in search of a better life and met their goal. \nFor more Elite Daily original videos , subscribe to the official Elite Daily YouTube Channel and like the official Elite Daily Facebook Page .
