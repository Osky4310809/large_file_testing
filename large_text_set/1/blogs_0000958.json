The Sarutobi clan was one of the first clans to settle in the newly-created Konohagakure , where Hiruzen struck up a friendship with the Shimura clan 's Danzō Shimura . Hiruzen was part of the first generation of ninja produced by Konoha and he, Homura Mitokado , and Koharu Utatane were placed under the tutelage of Tobirama Senju . Hiruzen early on displayed prodigious talent in the ninja arts, earning him additional training from Hashirama Senju , the First Hokage ; [8] at the same time, Danzō became jealous of Hiruzen's skills and started a one-sided rivalry in an effort to surpass him. Hiruzen is appointed Hokage. \nDuring the First Shinobi World War , Tobirama, by that time the Second Hokage, led a team consisting of Hiruzen, Homura, Koharu, Danzō, Kagami Uchiha , and Torifu Akimichi . During a mission they started to be pursued by Kumogakure 's Kinkaku Force , an enemy that somebody would need to distract and inevitably die at the hands of in order for the rest of the team to escape. Hiruzen volunteered to be the decoy, boasting that, as the strongest of their group, he stood the best chance of surviving the encounter; nevertheless, he asked Danzō to look after the others. Tobirama volunteered himself instead, and before going to his death he appointed Hiruzen as Third Hokage. \nIn the anime, Hiruzen permitted Danzō to create Root - a more ruthless subdivision of the Anbu under Danzō's exclusive control - shortly after he became Hokage in order to balance the shortcomings of his empathetic rule. For years he had ignored Root's questionable foreign ops, its abduction of children, and the actions it took against Konoha personnel, Hiruzen included. [9] Hiruzen with his students. \nAt some point, Hiruzen married Biwako and they had a son, Asuma , and at least one other child who became an Anbu. [10] Hiruzen also started leading his own team of new Academy graduates consisting of Jiraiya , Orochimaru , and Tsunade . [11] Although he was close with all of his students, Hiruzen had the highest hopes for Orochimaru , a genius like himself who, after the deaths of his parents, was only further motivated to have a deep impact on the world. [12] Hiruzen led Konoha's forces through the Second and Third Shinobi World Wars ; in the anime, his choosing to end the Third Shinobi World War by signing a peace treaty with Iwagakure despite the losses Konoha suffered incensed Danzō, prompting Hiruzen to step down as Hokage against the village's protests. [13] \nHiruzen had long hoped that Orochimaru would succeed him as Hokage but, despite his best efforts, he could never convince him of the Will of Fire : that Konoha was a family that the Hokage had to risk everything to keep safe. [14] Unable to choose Orochimaru, Hiruzen considered Jiraiya as his successor, but Jiraiya did not believe he was responsible enough. [15] Hiruzen ultimately settled on Jiraiya's former student, Minato Namikaze , who had proven himself time and again during the Third Shinobi World War. [16] Hiruzen assisted Minato with the transition of power by advising him on how to handle individuals and other village matters. He even retained some of his own Anbu , several of which he assigned as security while Kushina Uzumaki , the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails , gave birth. Hiruzen leads a charge against the Nine-Tails. \nDespite their precautions, the Nine-Tails escaped and attacked the village . Hiruzen led the village's defence until Minato arrived to remove the Nine-Tails to a safe distance. Hiruzen followed and, cut off by the Adamantine Sealing Chains , could only watch as Minato and Kushina gave their lives to seal the Nine-Tails into their newborn son, Naruto . Minato did not have time to tell Hiruzen how the Nine-Tails had escaped, instead using the final moments of his life to ask Konoha, via Hiruzen, to think of Naruto as a hero who saved the village and not the container of the monster that killed so many. Hiruzen did so, but the villagers proved unable to follow Minato's wishes, prompting Hiruzen, now the village's Hokage once more, to outlaw any mention of the Nine-Tails, an effort to protect Naruto from their misguided hate. [17] He also gave Naruto his mother's surname in order to hide his relation to Minato from Minato's enemies. [18] Hiruzen allowing Orochimaru to escape. \nHiruzen eventually started investigating a number of disappearances throughout Konoha. In the anime, he followed a lead provided by Kakashi Hatake , [9] which ultimately led him to discover that Orochimaru was behind it all. Hiruzen was dismayed not only by Orochimaru's role or that he was experimenting on those he kidnapped, but also his reasons: to create an Eternal Youth and Immortality Technique . He attempted to apprehend Orochimaru, but could not bring himself to strike down his favourite student and allowed him to escape. [19] From examining what Orochimaru left behind, a young boy imbued with Hashirama Senju's Wood Release was discovered, and over the years the boy became one of Hiruzen's top Anbu operatives. (In the anime, the boy was previously discovered by Danzō, and Hiruzen negotiated the boy's release into Hiruzen's care.) [20] Itachi begs Hiruzen to protect Sasuke. \nBecause Minato never had the opportunity to explain the cause of the Nine-Tails' attack, Konoha's leadership came to suspect a member of the Uchiha clan was responsible due to the Sharingan 's ability to control the Nine-Tails. The Uchiha resented this suspicion and began planning a coup d'état, something reported to Hiruzen and the Konoha Council by Itachi Uchiha . Hiruzen attempted to peacefully resolve the conflict but negotiations consistently stalled. Danzō eventually stepped in without Hiruzen's knowledge and ordered Itachi to slaughter the Uchiha . [21] Hiruzen only learned of the mission afterwards when Itachi reported its successful completion. Before needing to publicly leave the village as a criminal in order to hide Konoha's involvement in the Uchiha's destruction, Itachi asked Hiruzen to look after his younger brother, Sasuke , the only Uchiha he could not bring himself to kill. Hiruzen agreed. [22] In the anime, Hiruzen also promised not to change the village barrier 's formula, enabling Itachi to sneak in from time to time to watch Sasuke from afar. Danzō's role in the Uchiha's assassination was not something Hiruzen could abide, and as such he ordered Root be disbanded. [23] Personality Edit \nHiruzen is a firm believer in the Will of Fire , which holds that all the people of Konoha are a family and that the Hokage is chiefly responsible for that family's well-being. Throughout his tenure, Hiruzen lives up to the Will of Fire by being available for Konoha's villagers and shinobi during their time of need, making decisions to the betterment of as many people as possible, and providing his wisdom and guidance whenever he can. His delicate, thoughtful approach to not only issues within the village but also his interactions with foreign powers has given Hiruzen the reputation of being soft, something the Konoha Council spends much of its time trying to rectify. Nevertheless, Hiruzen's kind and pacifist ways are widely valued by Konoha's residents and even his rival Kage , and for those reasons his eventual death is regretted by many. However, Hiruzen was not entirely for his softness as he allowed Danzō to form an Anbu faction of his own, to handle the dark side of Konoha's actions. \nAlthough he loved all of Konoha, Hiruzen held his students especially dear, believing they were the village's future and, as such, must be cultivated and protected. He favoured Orochimaru, seeing in him a prodigy similar to himself whose contributions to the village could someday be greater than his own. Even when Orochimaru increasingly went astray and then finally defected from Konoha, Hiruzen could never abandon his attachments to Orochimaru, [24] instead blaming himself for not being a better teacher. When he is reincarnated , he reflects on his life and finds it similarly flawed: he feels responsible for Danzō's taking on of the village's darkness, believing Danzō would not have turned out so badly had he been more willing to make the difficult decisions; he believes that some of the village's - and even the world's - problems could have been avoided had he led with a firmer hand. [25] Hiruzen's own son, Asuma , was defiant towards Hiruzen's philosophies during his youth, but eventually sees the merits in valuing future generations after Hiruzen's death. \nDespite his reputation and responsibilities, Hiruzen is somewhat lecherous: he and Jiraiya bonded over their shared desire to spy on naked women; he falls victim to Naruto's Sexy Technique on more than one occasion and suspects he would be defeated by the Harem Technique as well; talking to young girls was his favourite \"hobby\". [1] Appearance Edit Hiruzen's Hokage attire. \nThe only consistent physical feature Hiruzen has displayed has been his below-average stature, all his other attributes having changed over the years: During his youth he was tan-skinned and had dark brown, spiked hair, adding a small goatee to his look after becoming Hokage; Towards the end of his life his skin is lighter, his hair is grey, his face is gaunter, and he has the wrinkles and liver spots of old age. He initially had a single line running vertically under the outer corners of each eye, which stretched down into his face as he aged until they reached his cheeks. Hiruzen's shinobi attire. \nDuring the First Shinobi World War, he wore grey shinobi battle armour common to the time period, with heavy protection all over his body. He starts wearing much lighter combat attire at some point, consisting of a black jumpsuit, mesh segments over the lower portions of his limbs, and a green gauntlet that covered much of his right arm. He also wore an armoured hood with a bandanna-like forehead protector over this, tied with two long straps. [26] Across the back is written \"Third Hokage\" which is replaced with the kanji for \"fire\" ( 火 , hi ) during his brief retirement. [27] When not in combat, he usually wears the official uniform — the customary hat and haori with a red, full-length kimono that is tied using a white sash. He often smokes during his spare time. Abilities Edit Hiruzen using the Shadow Clone Technique. \nHiruzen was a natural prodigy as a ninja, hailed as a \" God of Shinobi \". His talents were apparent at a young age, earning the special attention of the First Hokage [ citation needed ] and the envy of Danzō. He was regarded as the strongest Hokage during his time, [6] the strongest shinobi of his clan, [28] and the most powerful of the Five Kage during his life. [1] His prowess deteriorated noticeably in his old age, with Orochimaru noting Hiruzen could have killed him if only he were ten years younger. [29] Despite this, he retained enough skill to, with effort, defeat the reincarnated First and Second Hokage . Chakra Reserves and Physical Prowess Edit Hiruzen in hand-to-hand combat. \nIn the anime, Hiruzen was said to have immense chakra reserves in his youth, [30] and even in his old age, his chakra was strong enough to crack stone. [26] His reserves diminished in later years, to the point that splitting up his chakra with shadow clones was a great risk for him. His reduced chakra levels were offset with precise chakra control, needing only the minimum amount of chakra to use techniques to their full potency. [31] Hiruzen's speed and physical strength were also weakened by his ageing body, but his reaction time and sensory perception were still good enough to defend himself, even when robbed of his sight . [32] At times, Hiruzen could lay explosive tags without his opponents' noticing. [33] Ninjutsu Edit Hiruzen using the Dead Demon Consuming Seal. \nHiruzen was renowned as The Professor ( プロフェッサー , Purofessā ) due to his mastery of all forms of shinobi combat, [6] reputed for having advanced knowledge if not skill of all the techniques to ever exist within Konoha, including the many Hiden techniques that reside within it. [33] [4] Of Hiruzen's many techniques, he could use the Shadow Clone Technique to create copies of himself or the Telescope Technique to observe things from afar. [34] He was shown sensing and tracking individuals by their chakra [35] and demonstrated skill with barrier ninjutsu . [36] \nHiruzen's knowledge extends to fūinjutsu , such as the Dead Demon Consuming Seal . By combining it with shadow clones he could seal the souls of multiple targets, thus delaying the sealing of his own soul. [32] He was also said to be able to remove the Five Elements Seal . [37] Hiruzen's long life gave him a great deal of experience that he can use on the battlefield, such as identifying a technique simply by seeing the hand seals . [38] Even when he encountered something new, as in the case of Truth-Seeking Balls , he could discern their attributes and limitations from only brief observation. Nature Transformation Edit Hiruzen's clones using all five elements simultaneously. \nHiruzen was one of the few individuals who learned how to perform, and was proficient in all five basic nature transformations . He could also use Yin and Yang Release . [4] He could quickly determine the nature of an opponent's attack and produce the respective counterbalancing nature. [39] In the manga, he was shown being able to create a stream of fire and a protective wall of mud . The anime showed him being able to use a river of mud to unbalance an opponent and even expel flaming projectiles from an earthen, dragon-like head . He could then expel a flame breath to augment it. [40] He could also exhale smaller blasts . [30] Bukijutsu Edit Hiruzen utilising his Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique. \nHiruzen frequently used shuriken in combat, both the standard size and the larger fūma shuriken . [41] By using the Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique he could create copies of these shuriken, allowing him to bombard a target with thousands of projectiles without needing to physically carry that many on his person. [26] In the anime, Hiruzen was similarly shown utilising his surroundings like shuriken, such as launching roof tiles at opponents. [40] \nHiruzen's personal summon , Enma , could transform into an extendable staff that was as sharp as diamond. The staff was Hiruzen's weapon of choice and he wielded it with great proficiency, though its weight became a greater burden to him in his later years. Enma can manifest parts of his body from the staff transformation, attacking with claws or fangs to take opponents by surprise.
