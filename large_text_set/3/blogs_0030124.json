Ditto MSNBC. That is beyond anything I have ever seen in my 40 years-plus of journalism to have a story of that magnitude ignored by the national media.” \nReporters from the Times spent 18 hours on Thursday at Fox News and then wrote an in-depth report about the popular news channel. During the visit, Fox News hosts repeatedly called out the media for their silence on the Rockville, Md., case.

Henry E. Sanchez, 18, and Jose O. Montano, 17, were both charged with rape after a 14-year-old ninth-grade girl said she was forcefully taken into a bathroom in the Rockville, Md., high school and brutally raped. After the student’s arrest, police reported that Sanchez had an immigration case pending against him since August.

While several affiliates in the area did cover the incident, none of the major TV networks dedicated sustained coverage to the rape case,” the Times fact-checker reported. \nThe Times noted the way Fox hosts disparaged the silence of other media outlets. \nTucker Carlson, host of Tucker Carlson Tonight , said other media outlets were “determined to ignore it.” \n“In my mind, they’re telling our little girls that this little girl’s life doesn’t matter as much as these illegal immigrants’ lives matter because they don’t want to spread a negative story,” said Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt.
