By: Manas Tiwari | New Delhi | Published: February 24, 2017 12:21 PM It’s almost like the President of the United States Donald Trump is living an alternate reality and is not ready to accept the wrongdoings around him. (Source: Reuters) \nDonald Trump’s entire political campaign was based on ending terrorism in the United States and across the world and for that, he never held back from making comments about initiating a crackdown on illegal immigrants. He continuously promoted the idea of putting America first and even imposed a travel ban on seven Muslim countries as soon as he became the president. He took an extreme stand on immigrants, labelling them as a threat to the United States. However, while Trump was busy building his ‘wonderland’, there was a bigger picture being painted behind the curtains. \nOn Thursday morning, a 32-year-old Indian engineer, Srinivas Kunchubhotla who was working at the Garmin headquarters in Olathe was shot dead by a 51-year-old accused Adam Purinton who reportedly shouted ‘get out of my country’ before pulling the trigger. He also shot another Indian, Alok Madasani who was injured and was immediately taken to the hospital. \nGet out of my country? Really?! That’s what you say in a country that is home to 2.5 million Indian immigrants, in a country where from a cabbie to the CEO of world’s biggest company is an Indian! The Olathe Police Chief Steven Menke called it a ‘tragic and senseless act of violence’, while President Donald Trump has chosen not to respond at all. Just a few hours before this incident, Trump posted a tweet saying, “Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago. What is going on there – totally out of control. Chicago needs help!” Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago. What is going on there – totally out of control. Chicago needs help! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2017 \nYesterday, a similar incident of hatred was reported in a US flight from Chicago to Houston where a white man asked a girl about her boyfriend’s nationality to which she replied it is none of your business. Reportedly her boyfriend is of the Indian descent and reacting to her statement, that man said all illegals and foreigners need to leave the country. In 2016, a New York imam and his assistant were brutally killed while 180 anti-Muslim acts were reported between March 2015 and March 2016. \nAmericans per se, white Americans that is, are generally intolerant and racist in their demeanour. While that should not be interpreted as colouring the entire population with the same brush, but it holds true for a largish number of them who are now emboldened enough to act under Trump’s increasingly anti-immigrant rants. However, even this statement needs to be tempered by the fact that such incidents have happened under Obama’s presidency and before that too. It just goes to show that Donald Trump or not, the basic racial hatred spewing American population, which is significant enough in numbers, is now willing to increasingly take to violence. \nYou may also want to watch: \nDuring his first solo interview since becoming the President of United States, Donald Trump told the media that he is the least racist and anti-semitic person but his actions speak otherwise. It’s almost like the President of the United States is living an alternate reality and is not ready to accept the wrongdoings around him. What he needs to realise is that today it was two Indians who were attacked and tomorrow it can be two Americans. \nThe problem isn’t the immigrants, neither is it the Muslims; the problem is the negative elements who are trying to spread violence and fear. The President of world’s most powerful country should let them know that he won’t accept any criminal action like this instead on conveying that he won’t take any action like this from a ‘section of the society’.
