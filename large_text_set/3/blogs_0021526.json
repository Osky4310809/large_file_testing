Make a plan — Once your health care provider clears you to increase your physical activity , plan your way to greater fitness. Harvard Medical suggests starting with five minutes of fitness walking twice a week, and gradually increasing to fifty minutes of walking exercise six days a week, over twelve weeks. Walk at a pace that pushes you, but at which you can still carry on a normal conversation. Push yourself gently — If you have been sedentary for a while, don’t rush in, even if you were a competitor in the past. The benefits of walking for fitness are cumulative, but so are the effects of inactivity. Give your body a chance to adjust. If you are really out of shape, start by parking a few stalls farther away each time you go out, or consider walking to errands rather than driving. Take a flight of stairs rather than the elevator for additional walking during your regular routine. Dress appropriately for the weather — You will warm up as you walk when moving at a good pace; don’t overheat or get too cold. Wear decent shoes — You don’t need special shoes. But your shoes should fit well so you don’t trip, and they need to protect your feet. As you progress, you may want to invest in a pair of walking shoes. Be safe — Walk in areas that are safe to walk. You probably know areas that are not suitable because of terrain, obstacles, or crime. Stay safe. Walk with a friend or a group, so that if you encounter any problems, someone is close by to help, even if the problem is that you went too far out and are having difficulty making it back. Take your cell phone with you. Warm up and cool down — Walk at your normal walking pace for five minutes before walking for fitness, and for five minutes after. Keep well hydrated — Hydration is an essential component of healthy living. Make sure to drink enough water — alkaline water, if possible — before, during, and after you exercise to replenish lost fluids and help rehydrate your body. Enjoy Stress-Free Weight Loss, Increased Stamina, and Better Flexibility Above all, enjoy the walk. I am amazed by how much more of creation I see, hear, and feel when I walk compared to when I drive or bicycle. Combine healthy food choices with a progressive walking exercise plan, and one additional benefit may be stress-free weight loss. Weight loss, increased stamina, improved flexibility, and lowered risk of heart attack and stroke combine to commend walking for exercise as a winner.
