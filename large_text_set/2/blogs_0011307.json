Xiaomi Mi 6 to reportedly offer a 5.2-inch flat screen and Snapdragon 835 processor By February 14, 2017 “The Mi 6 is expected to be launched in the next couple of months” \nXiaomi’s upcoming flagship, the Mi 6, has been the subject of a number of leaks and reports in the past. Recently, a couple of reports had suggested that apart from a flat screen variant, the Mi 6 will also come in a curved display model as well. However, a tipster on Weibo in China suggests otherwise. \nWeibo user @ Mocha Specialist Workers claims that the Xiaomi Mi 6 will flaunt a 5.2-inch full HD TFT LCD display, and not an OLED screen with dual-curved edges. The source also suggests that the phone will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest flagship SoC, the Snapdragon 835. Earlier reports suggested that Xiaomi will also launch a Mi 6 variant with its in-house Pinecone V970 SoC . However, the tipster suggests that there won’t be a Pinecone SoC-powered variant of the Mi 6. The company could use it on the Mi 6s or Mi Note 3 instead. \nIt’s worth mentioning that several reports in the past suggested that Samsung has monopolised all the Snapdragon 835 chips for its Galaxy S8 flagship. However, Xiaomi and some other smartphone makers will also be getting their supply of Snapdragon 835 chips later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:08:52.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
