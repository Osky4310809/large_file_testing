A spokesman for Patrick Henry High School in San Diego said it was \"disappointed\" at the court's decisions (Photo: Google Maps) \nA court was told Ms Wolf had not intended to embarrass the student. \nHer advice was a \"lapse of judgment, she thought that was a good idea\", said Katheryn Martin, the school district's attorney. \nBut the girl's lawyers argued she had been humiliated. \n\"Something like this never should have happened to a 14-year-old girl just entering high school,\" said attorney Brian Watkins. \nA jury awarded her £1million in compensation plus £32,500 to cover medical expenses. \nA spokesman for the school district said they were \"disappointed\" with the decision and would be considering an appeal.
