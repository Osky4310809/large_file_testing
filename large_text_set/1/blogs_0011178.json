You've got to work a goalkeeper of Fraser Forster's quality. \n\"It wasn't the cleanest free-kick I've ever hit but it was very meaningful. \nBurnley v Southampton: Player Ratings \n\"It means a lot to me to come back to Turf Moor and do that. It's incredibly special.\" \nBarton was an instrumental figure in Burnley's promotion-winning side of 2015-16, and he feels the club has progressed during his absence. \nHe said: \"There have been additions to the squad, and the lads who have come in have added to what is an incredible collective. \n\"It's a unique club and a unique group of people, and I'm very fortunate to come back and be part of this again.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:49:29.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
