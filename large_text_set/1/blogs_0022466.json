He replaces Dave Dlugosz, who retired on Dec. 20, 2016 . He graduated from Avon Lake in 2004 and was a part of the 2003 state championship team. \n“I am honored to carry on Coach Dlugosz’s legacy at Avon Lake,” Kostelnik said in a media release. “He was such a major impact on Avon Lake football. I am grateful I had the chance to play for him and then work alongside him.” \nPrior to being an assistant at Avon Lake, Kostelnik coached at Beachwood as well as Notre Dame College and Mount Union. Kostelnik was an All-American at Mount Union. \n“We are very excited to have Matt as our new head coach,” Avon Lake athletic director Nori Okuma said in a media release. “He brings a diverse experience to the position that will serve him well as he transitions into his first head coaching role. His connections to the community and school are valuable.” \nIn 2016, Avon Lake reached the playoffs for the first time since 2013 and ended the season with an 8-4 record.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:05:59.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
