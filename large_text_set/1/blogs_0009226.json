Arsene Wenger. \nThat’s what the German star has revealed in response to criticism from club legend Thierry Henry, who claimed he and Alexis Sanchez are “holding the club hostage” with their wage demands. \nWith 18 months to run on his contract, speculation has been rife that Ozil could be heading for the exit door unless the club matches his lofty wage demands of £200,000 per week. \nThat prompted Henry to claim such money should result in “a hat-trick every week – and also when there’s no game”. \nBut Ozil has explained that before resigning, he first wants assurances about the future of Wenger, who brought the former Real Madrid man to the club. media_camera Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger shakes hands with Mesut Ozil. \n“Everybody has the right to say his opinion but these statements do not interest me,” Ozil told German magazine Kicker. \n“Such ex-players or other people...do not know what is actually spoken between the club and me.” \nHe added: “I am very, very happy at Arsenal and have let the club know that I would be ready to sign a new contract. \n“The fans want that I stay and now it is just down to the club. \n“They know that I am here most of all because of Arsene Wenger.

Look forward to what they will experience there: welcome to the real world! Our dressing rooms are not as luxurious as they have here... and they’ve got portacabins here at the moment.” \nJOSE MOURINHO’S HALF TIME TALK REVEALED \nManchester United beat Reading 4-0 in the FA Cup over the weekend, with youngster Marcus Rashford netting twice. \nBut coming into the half time break, manager Jose Mourinho had a simple message to keep the 19-year-old’s feet on the ground. \n“The goals for an attacking player are always nice,” Mourinho told MUTV after the game.” \n“For his confidence it is important he scores these goals but we won against West Ham with his contribution, we won against Middlesbrough with his contribution, and he didn’t score goals.

He had a big responsibility in the way we were breaking down their defensive line, he was playing so well for us so one less goal doesn’t change it for an attacking player. \n“He’s quick and against these teams we know they play from the back and use the goalkeeper very much. You press and you can get things.” \nSTEVEN GERRARD PAYS A VISIT TO FAN \nEvery now and then, there’s a story that warms your heart – and this from Steven Gerrard is one of them. \nVideo has emerged of the Liverpool legend visiting the house of young brain cancer sufferer Charlie. \nRocking up unannounced, Stevie G knocked on the door and the reaction of Charlie is priceless.
