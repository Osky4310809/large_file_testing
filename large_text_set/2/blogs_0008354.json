In fact, many people reading this probably weren't even born until after 1997 (Ahh! Your life is so fresh and FULL OF PROMISE!) This means that the following movies, though nostalgic and magical for many of us, might not be considered \"classics\" to those who never had to rewind back their VHS tapes. And so, we've compiled a list of comedies that are turning 20 this year that still (mostly) hold up. Whether you're rewatching an old favorite or seeing them for the first time, these movies are not only solid on their own, but also show how far comedy and film in general have come in two decades. Men In Black \nWill Smith as a secret government official who fights aliens. If Men in Black was made today, it would probably take itself too serious and suck. Luckily, Men in Black is hilarious, campy, and completely aware of its ridiculous premise. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery \nMike Meyers brought true genius to the screen with Austin Powers and his many sidekicks and nemeses, from Dr. Evil to Number 2. And prepare for a sh*tload of euphemisms that you might not have caught as a kid the first time around... Rocket Man \nRocket Man was the Disney Channel Original Movie before those were even a thing. I just rewatched it on Netflix the other night, and while I passed out half-way through, I definitely laughed a LOT before that happened. The Full Monty \nThe Full Monty is as hilarious as it is touching. It is also really f*cking British. My Best Friend's Wedding \nIf you're not into romantic comedies, this might not be your fave. But before romantic comedies became the dumbest/worst genre on the planet, movies like My Best Friend's Wedding made the genre a true favorite in the film biz. Liar, Liar \nJim Carrey was at the peak of his Jim Carrey-ness during the time of Liar, Liar . The movie is pure joy, and it's sad that they don't make family comedies like this anymore (probably because we're all out of young Jim Carreys). Chasing Amy \nOG Kevin Smith fans, rejoice! And for those of you who don't know Kevin Smith's work, Chasing Amy is a great intro. And BONUS â€” it's one of Ben Affleck's first ever roles! It's amazing what good dental work can do for an actor (like let them play Batman a couple decades later). Vegas Vacation \nIf you've ever been on a nightmare vacation with your family, or your family is awkward af in general, OR you have that weird \"Uncle Eddie\" type in your family, Vegas Vacation will always be fun. Gridlock'd \nThis movie holds up because its subject matter is still, depressingly, even MORE relevant today. Also, Tupac!! Titanic \nOkay, so Titanic isn't the most hilarious movie on this list, but it is 20 years old this year and it deserves to be watched by all of us. Come for the bewbs, stay for the endless sobbing! \nAt least we can definitely say that trailers have come a long way in the past 20 years! What's your favorite movie from 1997?
