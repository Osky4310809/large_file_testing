James Woods’ suggestion   Women’s March is PERFECT Posted at 10:51   Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nOne of the biggest gripes about the Women’s March (besides all of the cat hair) is that they do very little for women who are actually oppressed in this world. Sure, it’s all fun and games when they can put on their pink vagina hats and dance around with Madonna, but if they actually have to DO something meaningful they don’t seem interested. \nJames Woods had a great idea for the location of their next march … he’s a giver: Let's have the next @womensmarch in #MalmoSweden . And don't forget to wear those cute pink hats. Let's see how that works out… \n— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) February 21, 2017 \nYeah, don’t forget those cute pink hats. @RealJamesWoods @womensmarch I'll buy a few airplane tickets just to see that . \n— Rob T (@robbieredlv)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:07:23.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
