It’s also easy to find a car that has everything you’re looking for, so long as you’re willing to pay for it. Finding a car that’s in the sweet spot – a car that gives you good value over the long term and the quality you want – is the holy grail of car shopping. \nThat’s where the Best Car for the Money awards come in.

These are cars, trucks, and SUVs that are right in that sweet spot: cars that treat you as well as they treat your budget.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:15:49.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
