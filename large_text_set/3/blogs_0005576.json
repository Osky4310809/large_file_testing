The absence of the former Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona striker will be of some concern to Jose Mourinho, with the Portuguese consistently selecting the Swede.\nHere we take a look at how United could shape up without Ibrahimovic in their testing tie at Stamford Bridge…\n1. Rashford in, counter-attacking line-up \nMourinho has been known to ‘park the bus’ in the past and there would be no shame in trying to keep things tight in a trip to the league leaders.\nEric Bailly and Chris Smalling, who started against Southampton in the EFL Cup final, could return to the heart of defence, while Ander Herrera could feature alongside Michael Carrick in order to offer the back four more protection.\nMan United top scorers all competitions 26 – Ibrahimovic\n9 – Mata\n7 – Martial\n7 – Pogba\n7 – Rashford\n6 – Mkhitaryan\n5 – Rooney Henrikh Mkhitaryan is expected to be fit and, if he is, he should start and in this particular system, the pace of the Armenian, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford could be key to hitting Chelsea on the break.\n2. Faith in Rooney, workrate over pace \nMourinho is known for going for players he can trust in big games and he may decide to draw on the experience of Wayne Rooney.\nRooney career stats v Chelsea Games: 34\nGoals: 9\nAssists: 4\nYellow cards: 9 In this system, hard work is the key factor rather than pace, with Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata favoured in the wide roles over perhaps the more potent attacking threats of Mkhitaryan and Martial.\nMarcos Rojo has also been a trusted performer under Mourinho and his partnership with Phil Jones has been used regularly this season.\n3. Go like-for-like with Chelsea \nTottenham Hotspur are the team who’ve looked most dangerous against Chelsea since Antonio Conte’s switch to a 3-4-3 and they lined up similarly to the Blues in their 2-0 success over the Blues at the start of the year.\nMourinho could be tempted to follow suit and go three at the back in an attempt to spring a tactical surprise.\nChelsea defeats in 2016/17 season since 3-4-3 switch January 4: Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 Chelsea – Premier League\nOctober 26: West Ham 2-1 Chelsea – EFL Cup The approach could provide a dangerous front three of Mkhitaryan, Rashford and Martial more freedom, with Shaw and Valencia bombing up and down the flanks.\nIt may be too much to expect such a drastic change of system but if Mourinho were to opt for it, it’s likely he would include versatile players who could slot in to differing formations should it go wrong.\nThe inclusion of Daley Blind could, therefore, be a must, with the Dutchman slotting into midfield alongside Herrera into a more regular 4-2-3-1 that is usually adopted by the Red Devils, such as below:\n\nMORE: Mourinho eyes perfect Paul Pogba partner \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:29:47.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
