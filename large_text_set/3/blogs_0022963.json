According to the outlet, Lahren will be suspended for at least one week beginning Monday. \nLahren drew the ire of her conservative viewer base when she visited the ABC morning talk show last Friday and explained why, as a conservative Republican, she's still \"pro-choice.\" \n\"I'm a constitutional, you know, someone that loves the Constitution. I'm someone that is for limited government, so I can't sit here and be a hypocrite and say I'm for limited government, but I think that the government should decide what women do with their bodies,\" she said. \"Stay out of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well.\" \nLahren has since clarified her stance after facing backlash from numerous Twitter users who took issue with her comments. \n\"Listen, I am not glorifying abortion. I don't personally advocate for it. I just don't think it's the government's place to dictate,\" she wrote to one . \nThe morning after her appearance, Lahren also tweeted, \"I have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker.\" I have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker. â€” Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017 \nOn Monday, TheBlaze founder Glenn Beck questioned why Lahren, whom he noted once referred to abortionists as \"baby killers,\" had changed her mind while speaking on his radio program . \n\"I would disagree that you're a hypocrite if you want limited government and yet you want the government to protect life of the unborn. It's very, very clear,\" he said. \"But it takes intellectual honesty, and it takes a willingness to actually think these things through and to do more than just read Twitter or Facebook to get your news and your political opinions.\" \nBeck stated that many people have called for Lahren to be fired from the company, but he declined to discuss details of her employment. \n\"That's not for you to call,\" said Beck. \"That's not appropriate to be discussed on the radio. That's in the privacy of the office of TheBlaze.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T08:08:36.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
