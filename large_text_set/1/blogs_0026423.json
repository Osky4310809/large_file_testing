GOOD ON PAPER: Australian defender Curtis Good is included on today's teamsheet at @OUFCOfficial — Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) January 28, 2017 \n“The centre-back looked a little shaky at times during the first half - as did the majority of the Magpies defence, with the visitors struggling to adjust to the unusual formation,” wrote Chris Waugh for Chronicle Live. \n“But he also made a couple of crucial last-ditch interceptions and also had a glorious chance to score at the other end. \n“It is unlikely that we will see much more of Good in a first-team shirt this season given the final result, but Benitez has shown again that he is willing to promote players from the Under-23s when necessary.” 79' - Big opportunity for Oxford after the hosts get beyond Hanley but Curtis Good races back to intercept. 1-0. #NUFC #OUFC #EmiratesFACup — Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) January 28, 2017 Forget the result. How good to have Curtis Good back. After two & a half yrs out with injury he started in Newcastle's FA Cup loss o'night. — Daniel Garb (@DanielGarb) January 28, 2017 \nROO V ROO IN CHAMPIONSHIP \nMassimo Luongo’s Queens Park Rangers hosted captain Jackson Irvine’s side on his return from injury, but it was the Burton Albion captain who got the better of his Socceroos teammate. \nBurton secured a 2-1 victory to move out of the Championship relegation zone. \nLECKIE SETS UP GOAL BUT GOES OFF INJURED \nMathew Leckie had a mixed day in Ingolstadt’s 3-1 win over Hamburger in the Bundesliga. \nAfter setting up his side’s first goal in the 14th minute he was forced off before half time with a bruised leg. \nAccording to the Ingolstadt Twitter account, Leckie suffered a contusion of the left fibula. \nElsewhere, Mitch Langerak kept a clean sheet for Vfb Stuttgart in a 1-0 win over St Pauli in their bid to gain promotion back to the top flight. \nBRAD JONES CONTINUES IMPRESSIVE FORM \nFeyenoord goalkeeper Brad Jones kept a clean sheet as his side crushed NEC 4-0 in Rotterdam to open up a five-point gap over Ajax at the top of the Dutch Eredivsie. \nWhile Jason Davidson was confined to the bench for Groningen’s goalless draw with Heerenveen, Craig Goodwin came on in the 67th minute of Sparta Rotterdam’s 3-2 away loss to Willem II. — Feyenoord Rotterdam (@Feyenoord_int) January 29, 2017 \n‘POOR DECISION’ FOR SCOTT MCDONALD’S RED CARD \nScott McDonald was sent off 27 minutes into Motherwell’s 2-0 loss to Rangers, but his manager Mark McGhee didn’t believe the challenge was worthy of a red card. \nReferee Willie Collum had already sent of a Rangers player in the clash, but McGhee thinks the referee blundered in also red-carding the Australian. \nHe said: “It gets away from him but he toes it away, his foot’s on the ground, it’s not a sending-off. At the time I was looking at the other side of the park because he was looking to switch it. \n“Look, I don’t have any fears over the referee — he made a decision. \n“Seeing it again, it’s probably a poor decision, but it’s not to even things up, he thinks that it’s a sending off. \n“Yes, it’s an important decision, one he gets wrong — but it IS a decision, I don’t think it’s a balancing up of the game.” \nMeanwhile, Ryan Edwards played a full 90 minutes as Patrick Thistle played out a goalless draw with Inverness.
