Ha! \nSo what did Mariah have to say for herself?? \n\"I don't even know anymore… no matter what happens, I'm going to follow my heart.\" \nOkay. So we kind of already know how it plays out… but it's still fun to see how they got to where they are today! \nPlus, at least she'll always have a career in reality television if the whole singing thing doesn't work out. \nCh-ch-check out a sneak peek of Mariah 's World 'sTanaka-filled back half (below)!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:05:34.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
