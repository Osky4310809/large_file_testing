It clearly was not a basketball play. Vince probably thought he was hit first, and he was, so he retaliated with a vicious right elbow. Vince isn’t known as a dirty player so it’s actually a little fun to see he’s still got plenty of fight left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:53:03.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
