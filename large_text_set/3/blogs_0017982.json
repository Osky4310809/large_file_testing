The woman, whose identity is being protected, repeatedly asked officers Ronal Bergeron and Justin Iwen to at least be able to put back on her soiled clothes, but was denied at every request. According to ABC15: \nThe woman and her boyfriend were pulled over on March 5, 2016, as they headed home after at the Phoenix International Speedway, the lawsuit said. She was the designated driver. \n\nWhen Officers Ronal Bergeron and Justin Iwen approached the car, she explained that she wasn’t wearing pants because of her incontinence problem and asked if she could put them back on before got out of the car, the lawsuit said.. \n\nThe woman said that Iwen did not acknowledge her concerns and instead demanded that she get out of the car, the lawsuit said. \n\nShe repeated her request, but Iwen declined and told her to get out of the car. Once outside the car, Iwen again refused another request to let her cover up, according to the lawsuit. \nInstead of being allowed to clothe herself, she was forced to take the field sobriety test, alongside a busy road, while onlookers were passing by. She said she kept trying to pull down her shirt to cover herself, in a futile attempt to be covered. Patricia Ronan, the woman’s lawyer, told ABC15, her client is a victim of sexual assault and as such, her identity is being protected. Ronan also said the police conducted an internal investigation, and not surprisingly, cleared the officers of any wrongdoing.

The police report about the stop makes no mention of the woman being naked from the waist down, Ronan said,” writes ABC15. \nThe woman is seeking damages of up to $250,000 for the humiliating, and some might say, traumatizing event. Her boyfriend, who was also in the vehicle with her, will likely confirm her story and testify on her behalf. To date, there’s been no mention of any bodycam footage of the incident. \nBecause the officers conveniently made no mention of the woman’s nakedness in their report, it’s become a he said she said case. Fortunately, for the plaintiff, however, she was given a warning ticket for an improper left turn, which proved the traffic stop took place. Phoenix area police officers wear body cameras, and if body camera footage confirms and corroborates the woman’s story, once again, the American taxpayer will likely be footing the bill for yet another judgment against a police department. \nIncidents like the one above serve to illustrate just how vulnerable young women are when they encounter police officers in something as routine as a traffic stop. Precautions must be taken by women to ensure their safety. If a woman doesn’t feel comfortable pulling over on the side of the road, she can call 911 and inform the police dispatcher she intends to stop at the first gas station, for example. But even a preventative measure such as the one just mentioned would not have prevented the insensitive actions, heartless, and quite possibly perverted actions on the part of two officers of the peace who allegedly should have known better. \nIf you don’t think things like this can happen, watch the video below of a college teen being given a field sobriety test wearing only her shirt and underwear. Share Google + Marian Baghor \nIf I didn’t know better, it’s almost as if this is a bananasplit scene, a tv program we’ve once had in Holland, where people were asked to participate in a funny way, in public, and are fooled but told about it in the right time, so that they still can laugh about themselves, more or less. No humiliation, like in this interrogation. \nThis whole procedure seems so ridicilous and nonsensical to me. Why doesn’t the policeman let her blow an alcohol test so that her breath reveals if she’s drunk or not? I don’t think there’s a sense of decency in this policeman, but as there’s so much violence performed these days, by these so called protectors of citizens, I’m not completely surprised. What a strange world we live in! \nThe girl is acting rather like a bimbo, unfortunately, her body language is sexy and she’s not owning her personal space at all, neither does she express that in words and action. Of course I can’t know how it feels to be humiliated in this way, but on the other hand….. driving without clothes from the waist down… because of incontinence….???? Urrhhmm, was it her boyfriend maybe that’s fond of her driving that way? \nThere’s a slight fishy smell to this dramatic story. Though I don’t think the conduct of the policeman was right at all, including exposing her to the camera in this way. Lord Humungus \nYou’re one pathetic cunt. Piss poor attempt at spin boot licker. rb s \nThats why you keep your hands on the wheel and insist to speak with a supervisor, its like a parlay untill the sup. arrives. just my understanding. Marian Baghor \nTo keep it clip and clear, driving over the speedlimit without being dressed from the waist down is a foolish thing to do. It’s asking for trouble and this woman should know that. And her boyfriend too, though he may have had a great kick out of it before she was arrested. It may serve her to be in jail for a day or so. It may sober her up, she obviously needs it. What I receive as news and info about America, that world on the other side of the Atlantic seems to turn into a big movie “The Biggest Show on Earth” lol bojimbo26 \nOver 3 years since this happened ( going by the dash cam ) but no body cam footage yet . Body cams turned off ( malfunctioned) ? Larry Brothers \nThis is why you need to understand your rights. All field sobriety tests are voluntary, though the police will try to make it seem otherwise.
