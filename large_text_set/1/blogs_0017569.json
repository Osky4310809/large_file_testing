Obama’s preliminary rating eight years ago, when he took office as the nation’s first African-American president, was 37.2, according to the report. \nObama’s initial numbers ultimately translated into a national audience of 37.8 million, the second-largest since 1969, according to Nielsen data going back to Richard Nixon’s first inauguration. Ronald Reagan’s first inauguration in 1981 holds the audience record at 41.8 million viewers. \nThe preliminary data are based on programming from the seven networks that ran live inaugural coverage for much of the day, the Hollywood Reporter said. \nAmong networks, Fox News led with its coverage and was the only network to increase its audience from eight years ago. NBC finished No. 2 and led among broadcast networks, the publication said. \nIndividual networks may release their audience numbers later on Saturday. Nielsen may also report a total audience number for U.S. cable and broadcast networks.
