Photo: Courtesy of an anonymous tourist \nIn a strong message that serves as warning to those intent on disregarding the rules in national parks, including Yellowstone, a judge sentenced two members of the filmmaking group High on Life SundayFundayz to jail time. \nA third member who also pled guilty avoided jail but was fined Thursday, just as two others from the group did in November when they appeared before Magistrate Judge Mark Carman and pled guilty. \nThe Canadian group, consisting of five men, ignored warnings and broke laws, and videotaped and photographed its antics, then posted them on Facebook. \nThe group’s most egregious actions came on May 16, 2016 at Yellowstone National Park where four members disregarded warning signs and stepped off the boardwalk and approached the third-largest hot spring in the world, the Grand Prismatic Spring. \nA concerned citizen witnessed the actions and contacted Yellowstone park rangers, prompting an investigation. \nInvestigators discovered that the group also committed violations in Zion, Death Valley and Mesa Verde national parks, as well as the Corona Arch and Bonneville Salt Flats. 3 Canadian men sentenced for Yellowstone National Park violations: https://t.co/YSrmLmOnJu pic.twitter.com/8nB7Vpffdt \n— KTVQ – Q2 News (@KTVQ) January 20, 2017 \nAppearing before Judge Carman at the Yellowstone Justice Center in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, on Thursday, Charles Gamble and Alexey Lyakh pled guilty to disorderly conduct by creating a hazardous condition and foot travel in a thermal area in Yellowstone, according to a Yellowstone news release . \nThey also pled guilty to commercial photography without a permit in Zion; use of a drone in a closed area, riding a bike in wilderness and commercial photography without a permit in Death Valley; and the use of a drone in a closed area in Mesa Verde. \nFor this they were each sentenced to seven days in jail and will pay more than $2,000 in fines, restitution, community service payments paid to Yellowstone Forever, and fees. They will be banned on public lands for their five years of probation. \nJustis Price Brown pled guilty to the same Yellowstone charges as the other two and agreed to pay over $3,500 in fines and fees. \nRELATED: Filmmakers in hot water over blatantly breaking Yellowstone rules; video \n“The judge’s decision today sends a strong and poignant message about thermal feature protection and safety,” said Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Dan Wenk. “We implore all visitors to learn about the rules in Yellowstone, respect the rules and follow them. We ask visitors to take the Yellowstone Pledge . Protect your park and protect yourselves by staying on the boardwalks. If you witness resource violations, call 911 or contact a park ranger.” \nOn Nov. 1, Hamish Cross agreed to pay more than $8,000 in fines, fees and restitution for his Yellowstone involvement, and Parker Heuser pled guilty to riding a bike off the roadway in Death Valley’s Badwater and taking commercial photographs without a permit. He agreed to pay $1,000 in fines and fees. \n“It’s good to hear there were repercussions for those men,” one commenter wrote on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:36:44.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
