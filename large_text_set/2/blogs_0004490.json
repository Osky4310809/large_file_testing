What was your best play? This weekend marks the NFL's showpiece event: Super Bowl LI. \nThe New England Patriots will play for their fifth Vince Lombardi trophy, taking on the Atlanta Falcons, who have only ever made the big game twice. New England Patriots v Atlanta Falcons NFL Super Bowl LI February 5, 2017, 10:00pm Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \nSince Atlanta's last Super Bowl in 1998, where they lost to the Denver Broncos 34-19, the Patriots have been involved in six match-ups, and quarterback Tom Brady has led the team to four victories. \nThis year, the Falcons have been a free-scoring team to be reckoned with, but will face their toughest challenge on Sunday, where they come up against a Patriots side who have the meanest defence in the league. \nWith a raft of talent on both sides, Sky Sports put together their favourite play-off moments from both teams. \nFrom Logan Ryan's huge interception against the Houston Texans, to Julio Jones' catch-and-run touchdown against the Green Bay Packers. Neil Reynolds and Jeff Reinebold make their fantasy team from Super Bowl LI players. \nTo watch all of our favourite plays, click on the video above. Any moments we've missed?
