Dianne Feinstein specifically. Senate may vote today to weaken background checks on gun purchases. Call your Senator to oppose this change—ensure your voice is heard! \n— Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) February 2, 2017 You are a sitting senator. Shouldn't you make sure your tweets are accurate? https://t.co/3nsezAx0Rv \n— NRA (@NRA) February 2, 2017 \nFriction between the NRA and Democrats in Congress is nothing new, but something’s going on here. Obviously, there’s more to the story than Congress voting to weaken background checks. . @NRA says #gunviolence is a #mentalhealth issue but is fighting to make it easier ppl with said issue to get guns?? https://t.co/RoJr7V52ir \n— Intently.
