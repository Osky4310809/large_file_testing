He launched a campaign to sweep out government corruption totally. He didn’t want government corruption.” Trump salutes and lays wreath at the tomb of Andrew Jackson on his 250th birthday. What a beautiful moment. #TrumpTN #Nashville #TrumpRally pic.twitter.com/Qj1LqIMeMD \n“He expanded benefits for veterans,” he continued. He battled the centralized financial power that brought influence at our citizens’ expense. He imposed tariffs on foreign countries to protect American workers.” Advertisement - story continues below \nHe added that if these acts by Jackson sounded familiar, there was a reason for it. \n“Wait’ll you see what’s going to be happening pretty soon, folks,” he stated, referencing his plans to also cut the size of the federal government and help veterans, among other things. \nTrump did point out that, though Jackson “was a military hero and genius and a beloved president,” he “was also a flawed and imperfect man, a product of his time.” This statement likely referenced the seventh president’s ownership of at least 150 slaves.
