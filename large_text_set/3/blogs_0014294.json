Vox just BUSTED lib narrative that voter ID laws hurt minorities and turnout Posted at 1:50   Greg P.   \nWell, this isn’t going according to the Dem playbook, is it? A major study finding that voter ID laws hurt minorities isn’t standing up well under scrutiny https://t.co/T4V45ilnm3 \n— Vox (@voxdotcom) March 15, 2017 \nFrom Vox: It was supposed to be the study that proved voter ID laws are not just discriminatory but can also have a big impact on elections. And it was picked up widely, with outlets including ThinkProgress and the Washington Post reporting that the study found voter ID laws hurt Hispanic voters in particular and skewed elections to the right. But a follow-up study suggests the findings in the original were bunk. According to researchers at Stanford, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania, the original study was based on surveys of voters that are extremely unreliable — skewing the results. On top of that, several calculation errors led to even more problems. When the errors are corrected, the follow-up researchers found, there’s no evidence in the analyzed data that voter ID laws have a statistically significant impact on voter turnout. \nAnother gem from Vox — increased early voting might actually decrease turnout: \nIn fact, none of the other voting restrictions enacted by states seem to have much of an effect on voting either. Researchers have found, for example, mixed effects on whether early voting increases turnout , with one recent study finding that it actually decreased turnout on net if voters couldn’t register to vote and cast their ballot on the same day. \nSo, when do Republicans get their apology? When even Vox is forced to admit that Voter ID laws don't suppress minority votes, it's time to admit there's no valid reason to oppose them https://t.co/cDHCuBF98W \n— Jimmy's a GIRL!
