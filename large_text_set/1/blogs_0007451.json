Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2012\nLots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single, spread out shots! What do we have to lose.\n— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2012\nIf I were President I would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take - AUTISM.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 27, 2014\nAll caps for the people in the back, we guess.\nIf those tweets, ranging from summer 2012 to 2014, are too dated for you, here's Trump during a 2015 presidential debate on the issue.\nHe says \"autism has become an epidemic\" and links that epidemic to vaccinations administered in early childhood.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement in response at the time, calling Trump's claims \"disproven\" and \"dangerous to public health.\"\nThis was the American Academy of Pediatrics response when Trump raised his vaccine/autism theory in a GOP debate last year pic.twitter.com/UYutJegHri\n— Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) January 10, 2017\nWho knows what kind of power this new committee, if established, will wield over public policy.
