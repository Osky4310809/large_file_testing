And one of the coolest ways in which these filmmakers and companies reach out to us, is through limited edition make-up collections. We’re not sure if that’s everyone’s cup of tea, but as make-up lovers, these film-inspired make-up collections are our dreams coming true. So, if you’re a make-up and film buff, here are six Hollywood film inspired collections. \nBeauty and the Beast x L’Oreal Makeup \nWhile currently available (barely), and insanely hard to get your hands on, this pretty collection of seven lipstick and nail polish combinations was inspired by Emma Stone’s much-awaited fairytale film. Each of the seven is inspired by one of the seven principal characters in the film, including Belle and the Beast, of course, as well as Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, and Cogsworth. While the colours itself are more of less regular, it is the packaging that is the real kicker, with printed motifs inspired by each character. \nStar Trek Beyond x MAC Cosmetics \nMAC is famous for their celebrity collaborations, and, last year, in honour of the new Star Trek film, they released an entire collection of delectable sparkly, space-worthy make-up. Aiming to pay a tribute to all the wonderful women in the entirety of the series’ 50 years on the small-screen, the collection had a massive 25 products to its credit. From nail polish to liquid liner to face powders, eye shadows and lip glosses, each one was more sparkly than the other. \nThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire x CoverGirl \nWhen the second instalment of the intensely amazing Hunger Games series was coming out, CoverGirl came out with a whopping 28-piece make-up collection inspired by the world of films. The make-up brand even came up with twelve looks inspired by each of the districts in the film’s alternate universe, the Capitol. The collection contained shiny lip slicks, nail polishes, mascara, and nail stickers. \nCinderella x MAC Cosmetics \nInspired by one of the most popular fairytales ever, MAC Cosmetics released a Cinderella make-up collection that was as magical as you would imagine. With the prettiest blue and gold packaging, the collection included multiple coloured glitter powders, lipsticks, mascara, cream eyeliners, eye gloss, an eye shadow palette, lip gloss, and even two brushes. We’re still desperately trying to find any available remnants of this magical collection, but to no avail. \nStar Wars: The Force Awakens x CoverGirl \nBack in 2015, when the first instalment of the cult classic film series was releasing, CoverGirl came up with a super funky collection to commemorate it. And what a collection it was – with metallic, shiny lipsticks and nail polish. But the most exciting part was by far the mascara. The collection came with two kinds of mascaras, the Dark Side mascara and the Light Side mascara, both of which were available in 10 different tubes, each with a quote from the films! Insane, right? \nDivergent x Sephora \nGlobal make-up retail giant, Sephora, released a Divergent -inspired make-up collection, which also marked their first film collaboration. The neutral-toned collection contained eye shadow palettes, face palettes with bronzer and blush, nail art kits, and lip glosses. Wearable, but also just the right amount of sparkly, the collection drew from the different elements of the world shown in these films, as well as the movie's star, Shailene Woodley.
