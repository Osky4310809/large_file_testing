There is some truth in his most murderous traits–a little bit of Ed Gein and Ted Bundy–, will but he’s famously over-the-top and unrealistic. He’s a part of a narrative that alleges that insanity can be contagious, that a man denied a sex-change operation will make a suit out of women’s skin instead or that another will break into a museum and eat a painting because of that insanity. It’s a world that exists on a logic made for shock and thrills instead of realism. Even so, Lecter is a part of our culture, having even beaten out Darth Vader and the Wicked Witch of the West as the greatest movie villain of all time as deemed by the American Film Institute.\nFew villain roles have been as defined by one actor’s performance as quintessentially as Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. He first appeared as the cannibalistic serial killer in 1991’s Silence of the Lambs standing straight and still behind prison bars, staring directly at the audience as he comes into view. He’s only pictured for approximately 15 minutes of screentime, but it was enough to earn him an Oscar, cement him as the killer for two more movies, and become the singular vision of the character.\nPart of that is based on the film’s success–which to this day is tense, horrifying, and visually stunning–but credit needs to be given to Hopkins. He became a monster in the role. He seems to have no eyelids, constantly glaring into the camera with large, glassy eyes without blinking. He emphasizes the esses in his speech, transforming into a snake. His hair is slicked back, only adding to the strange shape of his head and pointing directly at his facial features. You can’t help but look into those eyes as he says he wants to eat your liver with fava beans. It’s… unnerving, to say the least.\nThis is the Hannibal Lecter many of us picture when we hear the name: the one that doesn’t blink and hisses at you but can talk around you until your head spins. He’s incredibly cultured. You can put him in a tuxedo and let him loose inside an art gallery, and he’d fit right in, and probably be the life of the party. He’s subsequently nightmarish and charming, lovely and horrifying, attractive and hideous. Who wouldn’t latch onto this vision? Hannibal Lecter–a renowned psychologist who killed people and ate the remains–the ultimate monster.\nBut that was in Silence of the Lambs . Ten years later, Hannibal happened, and it put Lecter front and center, which was probably not the greatest idea. A character that is little more than a nightmarish monster–that is designed to be a symbol rather than an actual person–can’t lead a feature film. This is mostly the source material’s fault, but even still, it soured the character. Two more movies– Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising only continued to overexpose him, the latter putting him in a bland and unnecessary origin story.\nBut years before even Hopkins got his hands on the character; there was Brian Cox in the 1986 movie Manhunter , itself an adaptation of Red Dragon . Unlike Hopkins, this Hannibal Lecter was stoic: cool and collected but casual. He seems more like a gangster than a serial killer. But he’s terrifying nonetheless, opting to talk circles around Will Graham and inundate him with quick, dense sentences. While Hopkins wanted to get into your soul, Cox seems to want to confuse you into submission. But it works. He’s inherently more trustworthy than Hopkins, who looks like he eats children for breakfast.\nOver the years, Hannibal Lecter on film has become more stylized, most likely unintentionally as a response to the poor aging of the source material and the cheesening of it. With the later Hopkins movies and Hannibal Rising , Lecter had become sort of a joke. The TV show Hannibal , brought to the small screen by Bryan Fuller, is, therefore, an obvious resolution of it: a fun, arthouse satire that pretends to take itself way too seriously in presentation and tone. The show is filled with obtuse symbolism, over-the-top performances, and the most awe-inspiring death tableaus in any media.\nThen there’s Mads Mikkelsen.\nWhen seeing the commercials for Hannibal I was skeptical. We had grown tired of the story, and this looked like another cash-in. What was its purpose? Who was this guy with the Danish accent and the well-tailored suits? And why did he look so good in those suits?\nMikkelsen’s performance as Hannibal Lecter might surpass Hopkins’ regarding longevity. Hopkins is great for a time, but over-exposure can destroy it. Mikkelsen is literally playing Lecter-like the devil: suave, sophisticated, extremely cultured, quiet, thoughtful, and scheming. You wonder what his end-game is, tearing down and gaslighting Will Graham slowly. In fact, it’s more complex than that. This version is closer to the Cox interpretation, with a Lecter that’s less of a caricature of a monster and more of a man who has accepted his lot in life but wants to bring people down (or up) to his level. He’s lonely and sees a kindred spirit in Will, which eventually turns into a dysfunctional romance over the course of three seasons.\nIn Hannibal , Mikkelsen has imbued the character with new life. He’s more three-dimensional, which makes him more terrifying. It’s hard to top looking into Hopkins’ eyes in terms of pure horror, but gazing into Mikkelsen’s is too familiar. This is the Hannibal Lecter that you’d visit for dinner and he’d feed you the body parts of your friends. You wouldn’t even know.\nI can go on specifically about Mikkelsen’s Hannibal performance especially now that the show’s been off the air for a while, but I hope this isn’t the final iteration. Knowing how adaptations work, and how much Fuller wants to bring back the show , I’m sure it won’t be the last Hannibal Lecter we see.\nSo, happy birthday to this terrifying, cannibalistic, charming monster, I guess. Here’s to many more years of making us be wary around meat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T16:09:42.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
