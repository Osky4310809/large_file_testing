We will wake up without institutions overnight.\" \nProtests were set to continue on Thursday in the capital Bucharest and dozens of cities across the European Union state, where a crackdown on corruption over the past four years has uncovered myriad conflicts of interest and a pattern of local officials handing out state-funded contracts in exchange for bribes.
