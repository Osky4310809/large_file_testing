The elder Ball has spent his time touting his son as the next big thing in outrageous fashion (see: Curry comments) and trading verbal jabs with TNT analyst and ex-NBA star Charles Barkley.”\n…\n“I would just back (Jordan) in and lift him off the ground and call a foul every time he fouls me when I do a jump hook to the right or the left,” Ball said. “He cannot stop me one-on-one. He better make every shot ’cause he can’t go around me. He’s not fast enough. And he can only make so many shots outside before I make every bucket under the rim.”\nThis was actually said by a man who averaged 2.2 points a game for one season at Washington State back in the late eighties.\nWith all of that in mind, the fine folks over at Sports Illustrated decided to put together a little simulation of this imaginary game of one-on-one using NBA 2K17.\nSo was Ball able to do in the simulation what he claimed he would have done in real life back in his “heyday?” What do you think?\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:14:43.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
