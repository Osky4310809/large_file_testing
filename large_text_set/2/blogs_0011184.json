Twenty-six members of the Harvard Undergraduate Council condemned a Valentine’s App, because the app only offered the two genders. You know, male and female, the classifications that normal thinking humans throughout history have used without problem. \nThe Harvard Crimson reported : \nDatamatch , a matchmaking algorithm created by the Harvard Computer Society for Valentine’s Day, forced students to choose “male” or “female” without offering options for genderqueer or gender non-conforming students. The algorithm’s website this year, however, allowed students to elaborate on their gender identity in a text box, but only after selecting one of the two genders provided. The horrors!! The Crimson continued to tsk tsk tsk the app creators: \n“We acknowledge that the Datamatch team has put in a great deal of work to crafting this event, and we understand that there are technical difficulties which have, in part, led to this situation,” the letter reads. “However, we believe that the values of this College are important enough to merit full attention, and urge Datamatch to take the necessary steps to ensure that this never happens again.” \nBut how can you fix such a problem? Some people claim there are almost SIXTY genders now. (Yes, with a straight face.) How can a dating app deal with the ever-changing landscape of politics and sex? Of course, the head of the Harvard Computer Society apologize profusely “the exclusion that we have created on campus.” \nOn Facebook, one Harvard Computer Society member offered a suggestion that could immediately be offered to fix the problem: “ no gender information will be displayed on user profiles.” \nUm, that’s a problem, too… Since most girls want to find a guy. Most guys want to find a girl. \nI guess, in addition to the $250,000 tuition price tag you also have to also give up your common sense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T21:02:55.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
