With the CSL transfer window shut, will we see Wayne Rooney or Ashley Young head to China in June? \nWith reports in the UK linking West Ham with interest in Wayne Rooney on Tuesday, ESPN FC asked Hammers blogger Peter Thorne about the Manchester United captain's potential fit in East London. \nIs he still able to play at the highest level? \nThe counterpoint to that question would be, \"Define the highest level .\" Rooney has had his high points with England certainly, but Gareth Southgate is, quite correctly, looking to the future and Rooney, 31, has nothing to offer in that respect. Similarly, as an impact player from the bench, Rooney might still be able to add experience to a Champions League squad, but in the cut and thrust of the Premier League, Manchester United now have better options and, more importantly for the growth of the club, obtainable futuristic targets. \nHowever, for a team like West Ham, Rooney has more than enough to compete at the level they expect to play at. Among the clubs outside the accepted top six, Rooney still has much to offer. \nWhat would he bring to West Ham? \nIn much the same way that Ruud Gullit bought Chelsea back into prominence when he was appointed player-manager in 1996, Rooney could become a focal point for a club trying to grow from Premier League also-rans. Despite suspicions that the Hammers would struggle to fill the London Stadium after the move from the Boleyn, the club don't seem to be having a lot of trouble selling the 25,000 extra seats now available. The signing of a player like Rooney, however, would really raise the profile of the club. The owners would dearly like to increase the capacity of the London Stadium further, and Rooney would easily make that possible. \nIs this a move the owners and manager should pursue? \nThe club learned dearly last summer that signing top players is extremely difficult. Despite having a good Dimitri Payet-led season, West Ham failed to achieve an automatic place in the Europa League as they fell away at the tail end of the campaign. Efforts to strengthen the side with marquee signings ended abysmally and may have led to the frustration felt by Payet when he demanded a move in January. Wayne Rooney could provide the final thrust West Ham need to join the Premier League's elite. \nThe Hammers are in a bind. They need top players to push on, but the very best don't need to join a club like West Ham. The club need a springboard, something to suggest the owners are trying to move the club forward on the pitch as well as off it. A rhetorical question certainly, but, had West Ham been able to sign someone like Rooney last summer, would Payet have been less inclined to angle for a move? \nWhy would he choose West Ham? \nOf course, Rooney might be better tempted elsewhere; a return to Everton would seem ideal for the Croxteth-born player. Unlike Everton though, at West Ham he would be feted as a player to move the club forward. If he succeeded, his profile as one of the best players of his generation would be assured. If Rooney feels he has achieved almost all that could be expected of him as a footballer, he would be astonished at what West Ham could offer and how he would be regarded if he was to add to his silverware while in London. \nThe status of players like locally born Bobby Moore and Trevor Brooking may be out of reach, but Rooney might well speak to Paolo di Canio -- another man who'd seen and done it all -- and see how he regards his standing among the Hammers faithful in East London. West Ham might just offer Rooney something he couldn't find elsewhere. \nWho would be a better target? \nA good question, and one without an answer. In terms of an obvious forward or deep-lying striker, the options are small. Moussa Dembele was reportedly a Â£20 million target last January, while Jermain Defoe still continues to interest Slaven Bilic but, in reality, recruitment for a club the size of West Ham is extremely difficult. \nWest Ham would only reasonably hope to stumble on another Michail Antonio from the Championship or find the next Sadio Mane from another continent. List the best 30 or 40 strikers from Europe, South America and Africa and then ask why any of them need to come to Stratford. If only for the fan interest and media attention alone, West Ham should pursue the Rooney option. \nPeter Thorne, aka Billy Blagg (@BillyBlaggEsq), is ESPN FC's West Ham blogger.
