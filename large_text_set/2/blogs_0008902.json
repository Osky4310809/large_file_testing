(Astrid Riecken/European Pressphoto Agency) That has prompted waves of volunteer lawyers to set up temporary shop at international arrival terminals, working around the clock and waving placards announcing “Free Lawyer.” Most have no way of knowing who is arriving from countries affected by Trump’s ban, except for information they gather in conversations with anxious family members nearby.\nThat dilemma spurred Seattle lawyers Greg McLawsen, Takao Yamada and Tahmina Watson to team up with software developers to find a tech solution: an app.\nAt airportlawyer.org, travelers or their family members can upload personal information and travel plans, including arriving date, time and airport. That information is then securely shared with volunteer lawyers who can track their arrivals and meet them at their destinations.\n“Those of us at the airport will know who’s coming in, and we’d be better prepared with information to work on their behalf,” Yamada, co-founder of a Seattle tech start-up, who has been volunteering his legal services at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.\nFrom the information immigrants and other travelers provide through the website, volunteer lawyers may be better able to answer family members questions about why an immigrant, whose flight landed at noon, for example, still hadn’t cleared screening by CBP five hours later.\nThey may also be able to get word to CBP officers that attorneys are available to answer questions, provide documentation and find interpreters, if necessary, the lawyers say.\nPresident Trump’s travel ban left thousands of travelers stranded around the world. On Feb. 3, U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, reversed Trump’s order and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is set to hear arguments Tuesday.\nA decision — either way — could shake things up once again, McLawsen said.\n“We believe that through the rest of the week, while the stay is in place, people will be coming in,” McLawsen said. “If I were one of them, I’d be jumping on a plane right now.”\nWhile Robart’s order helped ease travel for many, attorneys say some clients still aren’t being allowed to board airplanes overseas and are being detained for long stretches after arriving at U.S. airports.\nIn the midst of all the uncertainty, McLawsen said, he received a message on Feb. 3 from a colleague at British Columbia-based Clio, asking how the legal data management company might help.\nMcLawsen reached out to Yamada, who had begun getting calls from worried family members and attorneys asking if he could use his contacts at the airport to check on one arriving passenger or another.\nClio connected the attorneys with New York-based legal software firm Neota Logic. The team worked over the weekend to create the app in 48 hours.\n“Two of the scariest things for people waiting at the airport are not knowing what’s going on with their loved ones and if something is going on, not knowing what to do about it,” Yamada said. “We can help them find out and get them some help.”", "external_links": ["https://www.airportlawyer.org/"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:52:59.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
