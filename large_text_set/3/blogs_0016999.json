Researchers with the Academy of Finland found that night owls—classified in the report as “evening types”—tend to consume less macronutrients in the mornings than early birds, while at night they tend to consume more sugar and fats compared to morning people. Bottom line: People with morning-inclined chronotypes—that is, those who wake up early and go to bed early—tend to make healthier decisions throughout the day. So cut the crap and quit hitting snooze—it’s more likely to make you obese. \nThe difference in diet choices between morning people and night owls was exacerbated on weekends, when the night owls consumed even more fat than the early birds, and tended to eat more often and more irregularly to boot. The results of the study support the hypothesis that societal structures—work schedules, commutes, generally accepted mealtimes, etc.—favor morning people. If you like waking up and falling into a routine, the structure of a typical weekday is going to support that, whereas someone who likes staying up late is going to run into more obstacles in their desired routine, and thus have less control over their choices.
