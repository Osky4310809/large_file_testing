Senator Vincent Hughes speaks.(credit: Cherri Gregg) \nHe organized the gathering, which including the heads of organizations like the Philadelphia NAACP, Pennsylvania’s National Action Network, union leaders, church pastors, and many other grassroots groups. \nHughes handed out information on recent Trump administration appointments, saying the Black community can not longer stay silent. \n“It is important that we stake our claim,” he says. \n“The entire labor movement is under attack,” says Henry Nicholas, leader of the 1199C healthcare workers labor union. \nBorn in Mississippi, the 80-year-old activist says he was subject to poll taxes, fought with Dr. King, and has remained on the front lines of the civil rights movement from the beginning. \n“We cannot go back,” he says, we must keep marching forward.” \nNicholas says working people remained silent on Election Day, but no more. \n“It’s not too late,” he says, “it is too late if we do not heed the call of today.” \nBuses reserved by the Pennsylvania National Action Network are planning to leave Philadelphia’s Progress Plaza at Broad and Jefferson on January 14, 2017 at 6:30. Round trip tickets are $40. For more, call 215-765-6181. \nOther marches and rallies in advance of the Inauguration of Donald Trump include a nationwide day of demonstration set for January 15th, a Philadelphia March For Justice in the plan for January 16th (MLK Day), and a Woman’s March on Washington set for January 21, 2016.
