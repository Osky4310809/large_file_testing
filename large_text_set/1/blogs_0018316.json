Pictures has released a new teaser trailer for King Arthur: Legend of the Sword , offering another sneak peak at Guy Ritchie’s first take on Arthurian lore.\nThe film will reportedly follow the young destined king as he works his way up from street vagrant to the man who pulls Excalibur from stone. It appears Arthur will then have to face his evil uncle, Vortigern (Jude Law,) in order to take his rightful place on the throne. In other words, Ritchie is taking the classic tale and turning it into a contemporary revenge epic akin to Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings .\nIn this latest trailer, Arthur tells his Vortigen, “I am here now because of you. You created me. For that, I bless you.” Check it out above, then watch the original trailer from last year’s Comic-Con below.\n\nAfter you’ve finished, here are the five roles that defined Jack Nicholson’s legendary career .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T11:07:18.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
