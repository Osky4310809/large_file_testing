All three lived in the building. \nBurnette testified at trial that she killed Weingrad to please Farquharson, who had accused her of having an affair with him. \nIn a 2006 interview, Farquharson acknowledged that the couple had troubles with Weingrad. They believed he was homophobic and was trying to get Farquharson fired. \nFarquharson denied plotting the crime and said she regretted not anticipating Burnette's intentions. \nIn 1976, Burnette recanted her testimony implicating Farquharson, saying prosecutors encouraged her to lie. Prosecutors denied that, and a judge declared Burnette's statements unbelievable. \nFarquharson's case drew the attention of an advocacy group that seeks commutations for prisoners who it argues are serving unjustifiably harsh sentences. \nFarquharson, her supporters claimed, didn't pull the trigger and didn’t deserve to die in prison when Burnette served only 20 years. \nVolunteers with the Clemency Project, a statewide effort launched by Philadelphia Quakers in 1998, pleaded for Farquharson's release in applications to the state Pardons Board. \nFarquharson exhausted her appeals and applied for clemency twice. \nHer death makes Alice Green, 86, who is serving a life term for a 1977 murder in Philadelphia, the state's oldest female inmate. \nThe oldest male inmate is William Welsh, 93, who is serving a 6- to 12-year sentence for a third-degree murder conviction in Allegheny County. He started his sentence when he was 91. Welsh shot William Menni, a 59-year-old contractor, during an argument outside Welsh's funeral home in July 2013.
