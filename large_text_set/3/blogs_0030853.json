Brigham Taylor (“The Jungle Book”) is producing along with Los Angeles Clippers star Blake Griffin and Ryan Kalil of the Carolina Panthers. Griffin and Kalil are producing through their Mortal Media banner. \nTendo Nagenda and Chaz Salembier are overseeing for Disney. Related Disney Announces Release Date for ‘Mary Poppins’ Sequel \nThe story is set six years after the original Rocketeer, Cliff Secord, vanished while fighting the Nazis. An unlikely new hero emerges – a young African–American female pilot – who takes up the mantle of Rocketeer in an attempt to stop an ambitious and corrupt rocket scientist from stealing jetpack technology in what could prove to be a turning point in the Cold War. \nThe 1991 Touchstone-Disney film, based on a 1980s comic book, starred Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord and Jennifer Connelly as the female lead. Joe Johnston directed and Timothy Dalton starred as a Nazi spy. \nWhen the movie was released, it grossed a disappointing $46.6 million domestically. \nCAA reps Winkler, Spicer, Griffin, Kalil and Mortal Media.
