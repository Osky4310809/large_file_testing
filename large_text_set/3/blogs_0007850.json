President Muhammadu Buhari and late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua \nThe author noted that the bone of contention is the interpretation of section 146(1) of the Electoral Act 2006. The section states thus: “An election shall not be liable to be invalidated by reason of non-compliance with the provisions of this Act if it appears to the Electoral Tribunal or court that the election was conducted substantially in accordance with the principles of this Act and that the non-compliance did not affect substantially the result of the election”. \nAmosun Lauds Buhari’s doggedness, compassion \nMeantime, during the book launch, wife of the Ogun State Governor, Mrs Olufunso Amosun, described President Muhammadu Buhari as a dogged fighter, noting that his persistence to pilot the affairs of the country after four attempts eventually paid off. \nMrs Amosun spoke yesterday during the public presentation of the book, Buhari vs Yar’Adua: Facing The Future at the DLK Events Centre, Abeokuta. \nAccording to Amosun, “There are lots of lessons to learn from the life of President Muhammadu Buhari, most especially his doggedness and compassion for the masses. The successes recorded in the anti-corruption war of his government are ultimately to the benefit of the masses.” \nShe said further that the book “shows that the author has been following with keen interest elections held in the country and the petitions arising from them.” \nShe commended the efforts of the author, Mr Soyombo Opeyemi, for documenting the Presidential Election suit between the candidate of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), Gen. Muhammadu Buhari and President Umaru Yar’Adua of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2007. \nSpeaking at the event, the Secretary to the Ogun State Government, Barr Taiwo Adeoluwa, observed that President Buhari and Ogun State governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, were together in the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) in 2007, noting that “the two have had a long-standing relationship.” Tony", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T13:27:24.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
