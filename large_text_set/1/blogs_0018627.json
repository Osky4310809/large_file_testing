Woke up to the news that he actually did it. He posted bail this morning and is still going to be in route to the afc championship game in a few hours. His car got towed at the scene and had to post bail we need to start this stoolie a go fund me. \nViva la stool \n\n\nBOSTON (KDKA) — The Pittsburgh Steelers may not be facing off against the New England Patriots on a full night of sleep . KDKA’s Rich Walsh reports that fire alarms started going off around 3 a.m. Sunday at the Boston hotel where the Steelers and many fans are staying. Firefighters quickly arrived on the scene to check things out as guests waited outside. Hotel personnel said the entire hotel had to be evacuated, but it ended up being a false alarm. \n\n\n\nA couple quick things. First if you don’t want to get fire alarms pulled on you at 3am get homefield advantage. That’s on Pittsburgh. #2. If you don’t want to get fire alarms pulled on you don’t let fans find out where you are staying on the road in the AFC championship. That’s also on the Steelers. Therefore when you do the math the Steelers have nobody to blame but themselves here. And no I don’t condone pulling fake fire alarms, but I ain’t mad at this guy either. Stoolies gonna do what Stoolies gonna do. El Presidente |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T16:10:48.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
