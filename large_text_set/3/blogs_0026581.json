MP Jo Cox was stabbed and shot to death in June 2016 by a white supremacist. \nThe two Times reporters also neglected the decades-long campaign by the Provisional IRA against the British government. The nationalist terrorist group conducted major terrorist attacks in Britain in 1982, 1984 (where they tried to assassinate Margaret Thatcher), and 1989. The organization also conducted bombings in the 1990s until the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. \nSo perhaps the rarity of British political violence has been overstated. And perhaps the role of guns in perpetrating political violence has been as well. \nIn Townhall, columnist Matt Vespa adds: \nWhat does gun ownership have to do with an attack that involved a motor vehicle and a knife? Moreover, firearms and explosives were definitely used during The Troubles. It was just an anti-gun cheap shot. \nPerhaps the most recent event that rebuts the New York Times report about the lack of political violence in the UK because of its gun laws is the tragic case of British soldier Lee Rigby. \nReturning to his base in London, Rigby was struck behind by an automobile by radical Islamists, who then killed him while attempting to decapitate him. It was a horrific death for an Afghan war veteran. \nNeither he nor the police who arrived at the scene nearly 10 minutes after his death were armed. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:00:31.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
