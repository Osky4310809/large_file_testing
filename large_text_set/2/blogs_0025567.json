Eventually, the mistake would be acknowledged while the producers delivered their speeches, leading to some VERY awkward moments.\nWell, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News , Trump felt politics were at fault.\n“I think they were focused so hard on politics that they didn’t get the act together at the end,” President Trump said. “It was a little sad. It took away from the glamour of the Oscars. It didn’t feel like a very glamorous evening. I’ve been to the Oscars. There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad.”\nThe accounting firm responsible for the Academy’s ballot-counting, PricewaterhouseCoopers, has taken responsibility for the screw-up , as one of the ballot holders inadvertently handed the presenters with the Best Actress envelope. (There are two briefcases — one on each side of the stage — with an identical set of envelopes.)\nThis would appear to be Trump’s first comment on this year’s Academy Awards broadcast. Host Jimmy Kimmel tried to troll the president on Twitter to respond live on the air, sending out a tweet from the stage.\n[image via screengrab]\n—\nFollow Justin Baragona on Twitter: @justinbaragona\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/02/27/pricewaterhousecoopers-oscar-flub-we-made-human-error/98481348/", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Ftrump-claims-best-picture-oscar-snafu-occurred-because-they-were-focused-so-hard-on-politics%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/trump-8-1.jpg&description=Trump%20Claims%20Best%20Picture%20Oscar%20Snafu%20Occurred%20Because%20%26%238216%3BThey%20Were%20Focused%20So%20Hard%20on%20Politics%26%238217%3B", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/02/27/exclusive-president-trump-oscar-fail-focused-hard-politics-not-get-basics-right/", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Ftrump-claims-best-picture-oscar-snafu-occurred-because-they-were-focused-so-hard-on-politics%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://twitter.com/#!/justinbaragona"], "published": "2017-02-28T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:11:09.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
