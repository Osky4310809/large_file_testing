On my test system running the latest Current Branch build, Windows 10 version 1607, it was only visible after I had successfully installed the latest cumulative update and then returned to Windows Update. \nThe \"Yes, show me how\" link leads to a fairly bland \"Coming soon\" web page offering a few details about the upcoming release of version 1703 and information on how to get an early look by signing up for the Windows Insider Program. (If you follow my Windows 10 tips collection, you already had detailed instructions on how to cut to the front of the line .) \nToday's other Windows Update news is potentially far more significant, especially for harried IT pros trying to stay on top of the new Windows-as-a-service release cycle. \nThe first \"delta updates\" for Windows 10 version 1607 and Windows Server 2016 are now available in the Microsoft Update Catalog . If you search for KB4013429 (the official Knowledge Base ID for the March 2017 Cumulative Update to Windows 10 version 1607), this is what you'll see. \nThis month marks the first time that smaller delta updates are available for download. \nThe full Cumulative Update packages, listed in the bottom of the list, is a hefty one indeed. For the 64-bit editions, the download is well over 1 GB in size, and even the 32-bit version clocks in at over half a gigabyte.
