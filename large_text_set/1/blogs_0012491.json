The network has moved “His & Hers” co-hosts Michael Smith and Jemele Hill to the 6 p.m. edition of “SportsCenter” effective next month, shifted Stephen A. Smith’s debate-style “First Take” to ESPN from ESPN2 and a week ago confirmed Chris Berman’s departure after 38 iconic years on “Sunday NFL Countdown” among other shows.\nThe decision to bring an end to ESPN Radio’s signature morning show, which has aired since 1998 with Greenberg and Golic at the helm, opens uncharted territory for both veteran ESPN employees.\nAccording to SI, Trey Wingo, a current host of “SportsCenter” and “NFL Live,” stands as the leading candidate to replace Greenberg on “Mike & Mike” (“Mike & Trey”?). Wingo, who has previous experience on ESPN Radio, is also in the running to take over Berman’s NFL duties, too. Golic’s son, Mike Jr., is also expected to have some role in the new program. He is currently a college football analyst for the network.\nThe move opens a new opportunity for Greenberg, but jeopardizes a consistent program and a known revenue provider.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:43:59.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
