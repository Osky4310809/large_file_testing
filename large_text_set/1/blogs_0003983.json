They’re almost always underwhelming and are often made only to please a tiny sliver of people who are smugly in the know. Sometimes they even remove you from the feeling of the movie you just watched. End credits, though? Those can be pretty damn awesome because you don’t have to wait through the scroll. They happen right after the last scene.

And different movies do that in different ways. \nGood Will Hunting lets that last feeling roll on by showing Will Hunting’s car on his drive away from home and toward Skylar. Comedies continue the laughs with gag reels while other movies provide an epilogue or a recap to what happened. All of those end credits are much better than any post-credits scenes, right?
