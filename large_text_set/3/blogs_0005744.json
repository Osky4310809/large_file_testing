This time, the handset was photographed posing next to its larger sibling, the Galaxy S8 Plus.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com By now, you’re probably pretty familiar with the appearance of both devices, so it won’t come as a surprise to hear that this latest batch of images doesn’t uncover any new design features. It does offer the clearest side-by-side size comparison we’ve seen to date, however.\nA handful of close-up photographs of the Galaxy S8 also clearly highlight the positioning of the SIM tray on the top, and headphone jack and USB-C port on the bottom.\nMore importantly, though, they appear to confirm that the device will ship with a persistent on-screen home button to compensate for the removal of the physical key.\nWith regards to specs… Recent rumors point towards the Galaxy S8 sporting a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display, a Snapdragon 835 octa-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, a 12MP rear-facing camera, an 8MP selfie shooter and a 3,000mAh battery.\nThe Galaxy S8 Plus, on the other hand, is expected to pack almost identical specifications, though it should have a larger 6.2-inch Super AMOLED screen, dual 12 rear-facing cameras and a 3,500mAh battery cell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:06:50.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
