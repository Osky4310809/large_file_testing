They’re trying to correct the course of a sport that’s seen the amount of boys age 6 to 12 playing organized tackle football fall by 20 percent since 2009. Most of their solutions involve trying to reconfigure the game so that players hit each other less.

Enthusiastic ESPN NFL yowler Jon Gruden was a keynote speaker at the event and he brought up an important threat to football as we know it: geniuses. \n“There are a lot of geniuses out there that are diminishing football right now,” said Jon Gruden, a former coach of the Oakland Raiders and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who now works as an analyst for ESPN. “There are a lot of geniuses that are trying to damage the game, and ruin the game. Do you feel it? There are a lot of geniuses that want to eliminate all sports, including recess.” \nThe people were with him.
