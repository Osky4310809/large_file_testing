The guys are joined by Brooklyn Nets Assistant General Manager Trajan Langdon to talk Duke, his time at CSKA Moscow, and the Nets organisation, before Golden State Warriors guard Ian Clark jumps on to talk about his rise up the team’s rotation, and why the Warriors’ chemistry is so good. \nSubscribe to the podcast on iTunes by CLICKING HERE. Matthew Dellavedova.

For him to be asked to start and run the team with Giannis and Jabari, he has handled everything we’ve thrown at him. He was great tonight.” \nWhile Dellavedova has proven himself to be the more capable playmaker — averaging 5.6 assists per game, compared to Brogdon’s 3.6 — the Bucks’ starting point guard position seems to be better suited to a guard who’s more scoring-oriented. \nThe team’s leading assist-man isn’t its point guard; it’s its ‘point forward’, Giannis Antetokounmpo, who’s averaging 5.9 assists per game. With the ‘Greek Freak’ running the point, it makes sense to surround him with scorers, which is why Jabari Parker is in the midst of a career scoring year, and Tony Snell’s three-point shooting is improving with every month. Malcolm Brogdon is in impressive form. Source: AP \nThe question isn’t whether Dellavedova is a starter in the NBA, because he has the ability to start for several teams. The question is: is Dellavedova the right type of player to be starting for this team? \nWith Brogdon proving himself to be the more versatile, efficient scorer of the pair, he’s been able to excel next to a play-making, ball-dominant wing like Antetokounmpo. \nOn the other hand, Dellavedova, who has impressed, may be better suited to return to his ‘super sub’ role, running the point for the team’s second unit. \nDellavedova’s hamstring injury isn’t expected to keep him out for much longer, so, when he’s ready to return to the court, Jason Kidd has an important decision to make. \nOlgun Uluc covers basketball for Fox Sports Australia.
