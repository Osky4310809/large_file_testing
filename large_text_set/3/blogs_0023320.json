As we were winding down, she began throwing a bevy of random financial planning questions our way. \nOne great question she asked—and the topic of this post—is whether the Dow reaching 20,000 was a good thing or a bad thing. While nobody knows for sure, I knew instantly this question was worth exploring a little more. \nOver the years, many people have tried to guess the direction of the stock market. Almost without fail, the vast majority of investors who try to time the market bomb the task. Although some people get lucky now and then, numerous academic studies have shown that no one successfully guesses the direction of the stock market consistently. \nDue to a myriad of factors, it’s impossible to know when what goes up must come down. And if anyone tells you where the market is headed next, they are probably trying to sell you something. \nWhile you might hate the idea you have no idea what the stock market will do next, the solution is simple. No matter what, you should strive to create an investment strategy that will perform regardless of when (not if) the next market crash occurs.

Investing for the Next Market Crash: Three Strategies for Success \nInvesting for the next stock market crash isn't rocket science, but there are several proven principles for investing success to consider. Those principles include: Buy and hold Pick the portfolio that’s right for your risk tolerance 1. Buy and Hold: Stay the Course \nStaying the course is a surefire way to get the investment return of the stock market. Why? Because you simply can’t determine when the next stock market crash will happen. Jumping in and out of your investments only guarantees that you'll pay more in trading fees, eroding your investment return over time. \nHistorically, staying the course has generated handsome investment returns—even through some of the worst market dips imaginable. \nIf you had stayed the course through market corrections , you would have been handsomely rewarded. \nHow much would you have earned if you stayed the course from 1980 to 2016? How about 11%+ per year on average over a span of 37 years. This is the type of reward people typically see when they hang in there for the long run.

By not putting all your eggs in one basket, you are reducing risk, giving you the potential to score on investments that zig while others zag. \nHow would you like an investment that tends to increase in value when the U.S. stock market declines? Then look no further than United States government bonds—arguably the most valuable asset of a diversified portfolio. Government bonds tend to increase in value during domestic stock market drawdowns. This is just one example of how diversifying can help you weather the ups and downs of the stock market, but there are plenty more where that came from. (For related reading, see: Diversification: Protecting Portfolios From Mass Destruction .) 3. Pick the Right Stock/Bond Mix for You \nAnother great way to design your portfolio for the next stock market crash is to create a portfolio that you can stick with. If you can’t stomach the ups and downs of the market, either: Don't look at your investments! Opt for fewer stocks, picking up more U.S. government bonds for your portfolio instead. \nWhile bonds have historically earned a smaller investment return than stocks, being able to stick with your investments through the ups and downs is more important than arranging your portfolio for the maximum investment return. \nWhy? Because if you choose a portfolio of all stocks and then sell everything at the next market bottom, you’re going to lose money. If your portfolio is conservative enough that you can stick with it, that’s always a winning strategy.

It Doesn’t Matter if the Next Market Crash Is Around the Corner \nWhile it’s impossible to know if the next market crash is around the corner, you can design your portfolio so that if the next crash happens tomorrow, you will be prepared because: You know to stick with your investments Have diversified into U.S. government bonds You have created a portfolio that suits your appetite for risk \nDon't let current market movements fool you into investing like a madman—or worse, becoming too conservative. No one knows where the stock market is headed next, and that includes you. The best investment move you can make today, tomorrow, and in the future , is to choose an investment strategy that will last for the long run, then stick with it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T09:48:25.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
