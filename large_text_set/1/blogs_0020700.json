This accounts for the major reason why many pregnant women find it extremely difficult to give birth through the normal way,” Mbakwem said. \nHe assured that UNICEF was working assiduously to ensure total elimination of FGMC practice by 2030, when the sustainable development goals must have been achieved. \n“FGMC not only violates the sexual/reproductive health/right of a woman/girl, but also endangers their sexual/reproductive health”, Mbakwem said. \nEarlier in his welcome address, the State NOA Director, Mr. Vitus Ekeocha, described FGMC practice as “very harmful and has several health health and psychological effects on women”. \nHe said that because the practice is prevalent in Imo, UNICEF and UNFPA are collaborating with the Federal Government and other agencies to fight the malaise.
