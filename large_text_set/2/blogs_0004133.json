It is forecast to move northwest at the speed of 11 kph. \nNo tropical cyclone warning signal was raised in any part of the country as of noontime yesterday. \nBased on the latest forecast track, the weather system will continue to move closer toward Eastern Visayas until this morning before heading northeast away from the Philippine area of responsibility. \nIt is expected to be at 405 km east of Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur this morning and at 450 km east of Guiuan, Eastern Samar tomorrow.   \nBising is expected to exit the Philippine area of responsibility on Wednesday. \nWhile not expected to make landfall, the cyclone may still bring light to moderate rains in the eastern part of the country, PAGASA weather forecaster Loriedin de la Cruz said. \nSea travel is also risky on the eastern seaboards of Southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. \nDe la Cruz said the cyclone enhances the northeast monsoon, which brings rain to the northern and central part of Luzon. \n“Cloudy skies with light rains is expected over Cagayan Valley region and the province of Aurora. Partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated light rains will prevail over Metro Manila, the regions of Ilocos and Cordillera and the rest of Central Luzon,” PAGASA said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:50:48.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
