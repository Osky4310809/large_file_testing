SPUR, Texas (AP) — Three storm chasers were killed when their vehicles collided at a rural crossroads during severe West Texas storms on Tuesday.\nThe storms spawned multiple funnel clouds and an occasional tornado in open areas of West Texas on Tuesday afternoon. No damage was reported. \nThe crash happened at a remote intersection near the town of Spur, about 55 miles southeast of Lubbock. Tornadoes had been reported nearby at the time of the crash and heavy rain had been reported in the area, according to the National Weather Service. \nThe Texas Department of Public Safety identified the three storm chasers killed as Kelley Gene Williamson, 57, and Randall Delane Yarnall, 55, both of Cassville, Missouri, and Corbin Lee Jaeger, 25, of Peoria, Arizona. \nJaeger, according to his Facebook page, has ties to Colorado, where he attended Douglas County High School. At an early age, Jaeger caught the “weather bug” growing up in Colorado where he saw many high plains storms, according to his profile on the website madwx.com. \nDPS Sgt. John Gonzalez said the Chevrolet Suburban driven by Williamson ran a stop sign and slammed into the Jeep driven by Yarnall with Jaeger as passenger. All three were killed instantly. \nIn Oklahoma, video from KOKH-TV showed a semitrailer that overturned on Interstate 40 near El Reno due to high winds. \nOn Wednesday, the threat shifts eastward, and forecasters say about 19 million people in Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana could see stormy weather, including the possibility of strong tornadoes.
