X HSE puts St Senan’s psychiatric hospital on market at €780,000 Three-storey 19th-century redbrick blocks on 46 acres in Enniscorthy closed in 2015 17 minutes ago \nAn Taisce has described the St Senan’s psychiatric hospital in Enniscorthy as “one of the most impressive 19th-century institutional buildings in the country”. The former St Senan’s psychiatric hospital in Enniscorthy , Co Wexford , is to be offered for sale at a knockdown price by the Health Service Executive . Waterford auctioneers Purcell Properties are guiding €780,000 for the 49-bay, three-storey redbrick blocks with five towers and an overall floor area of 12,077sq m (130,000sq ft). It served as a county asylum when it first opened in 1868 and continued to provide a range of medical services until its closure in 2015. Standing high above the Slaney Valley on the edge of Enniscorthy, the Italianate-style buildings could be converted into a variety of uses including a hotel, leisure centre, nursing home, office complex, educational facility or refugee accommodation. The buildings stand on a site extending to 46.3 acres, including 15 acres zoned for residential use. Close by, Purcell Auctioneers are also guiding €630,000 for a separate landholding extending to 44 acres, which is to be auctioned on February 7th. Although zoned for a housing development, it is likely to remain in agricultural use because of its out-of-town location and poor access road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T08:18:53.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
