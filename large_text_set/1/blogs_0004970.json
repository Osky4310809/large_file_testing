She's known for her irreverent interviews. We'll call them that. Getting more than 9,000 celebrities to curse. The goal today is to get you to. Not happening. I want a job. You're sharing some of the best stories in your memoir, everybody curses, I swear. Is that a record? We can break a new. Why is swearing important? It's the language of the people. The second that you let one fly, everybody knows who you are and where you're coming from. It's like sitting down and having a beer with George Clooney. That's what he's going to do. He's going to open up and let a few fly. When we're little, the word fart might as well be a swear word and it makes us giggle. The same happens with bigger f-bombs now. That's why swearing works. It's easy to break down people and get to know who they really are. Colin Farrell was an interview that didn't go as planned. Because he didn't swear or because of something else? That was my problem. I was so preoccupied that I was interviewing Colin Farrell for the first time. You get a little awe struck. I was worried about hair, clothes, fake tan. When the interview was over, I was devastated. He didn't swear for me. Turns out, I watched the tape, he did. I didn't notice because I wasn't in the moment. We're so happy you're with us. \"Everybody curses, I swear\" Good morning. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate. The four-time NASCAR champion reflects on his career and family, and talks about his new book with \"GMA\" anchor Michael Strahan.
