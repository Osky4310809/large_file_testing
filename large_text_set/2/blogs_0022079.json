Millennials have taken the power suit look and turned it sexy. The Pretty Little Liars star rocked some sleek black Elizabeth and James spring suiting to Vanity Fair and L’Oréal Paris’ Toast to Young Hollywood, and the effect was stunning!\nCelebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta did a heavy black winged liner on the Shades of Shay star’s almond-shaped eyes and kept the rest of her face matte and neutral. Shay’s usual strong brow framed the eye perfectly, and a nude lip let the eyes take the spotlight.\nThis eyeliner means business.
