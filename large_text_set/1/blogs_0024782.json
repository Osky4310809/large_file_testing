Charlotte McKinney is looking for a new man and she’s even gone as far as to tell us what she’s looking for in one.\nThat’s right. Let’s suspend reality for a few moments and pretend for a bit that any of us really have an actual shot at dating this…\n\nIn a recent interview with E! News , our 23-year-old dream girl hammered home just how available she is these days… \n“I am so, so single right now,” she said. “It’s so funny. I’m like, even in hair and makeup, I’m like, ‘I am so single, it’s crazy.’ Usually I have some little things here and there.”\n“Starting this year off, I’ve been really focused on work,” she added. “But I’m really out there. I’m open, I’m here!” \nAnd I’m here!!! Hello?!\nThe actress told [E! News’ Will] Marfuggi she is currently looking for a funny guy.\n“A lot of people know, for me, my biggest thing is humor,” she said. “A funny guy and that doesn’t take themselves too serious and who doesn’t talk about themselves all day. That’s what I find in L.A.—that every guy…so there’s a lot of guys who just, yeah, just overdo it on themselves.”\nI can do that. I can do all of that!\nHere’s the entire interview…\n\nWow. \nI think this calls for a little celebration. How about we take a look back at the mind-bendingly hot photo shoot that we did with Charlotte and think about the possibilities before crawling back into awful reality?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall me.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T04:22:10.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
