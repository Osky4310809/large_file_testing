Being an off-ball play, there was little awareness (by the officials or internet sleuths) until after the game.\nWith about five minutes left in the first, B.C.’s Connar Tava set a screen on Allen, the two getting entangled. It appeared that Allen’s kneejerk reaction was to donkey kick his leg into dangerous Tava territory. Tava half hopped over Allen’s outstretched leg, stumbling a bit as play continued.\nOn Twitter, Tava appeared to call out Allen.\nCan't stop, won't stop https://t.co/P46bgDIsZG \n— Connar Tava (@megacon_2) January 7, 2017 \n\nAllen twice overtly tripped last season and once this year, which resulted in an indefinite suspension from Mike Krzyzewski on Dec. 22 — which lasted all of one game.\nThis was Allen’s second game back and Duke’s first without Krzyzewski, who is expected to miss up to four weeks following back surgery.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T01:38:27.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
