Just Tweets. Nothing else.\nCofounders Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone launched the site with these 20 characters each:\njust setting up my twttr\n— jack (@jack) March 21, 2006\njust setting up my twttr\n— Biz Stone (@biz) March 21, 2006\nBut over the last few years, Twitter has transformed into a site offering images, video, and most recently, live video. To say nothing of all the change its basic text product has spurned throughout the world, for better or worse.\nThat said: Video is the future . Or so says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. And while Dorsey (two-time, part-time CEO) touts the word \"live\" more than video , he's shown that they're on the same quest: to capture the attention of consumers, and the passion of creators. Video's where the eyes are, and therefore, the ad dollars (something Twitter desperately needs if it wants to appease its skeptical-if-not-increasingly-critical investors).\nOn Tuesday, Twitter released the Periscope Producer API, allowing creators to broadcast from external hardware and integrate software services to the app. This update means anyone can sign up for access and create high-end video for Periscope, similar to what you'd see shared on television—or, even more aptly—on YouTube.\nLive video on Twitter's a bit confusing, at the moment.\nTwitter now offers:\nTwitter Live: High-end, live video streamed directly to Twitter, like what you saw at SXSW with \"The Mashable Show\" and every weekday with Bloomberg TV\nTwitter Video: Video uploaded to Twitter.com, or the Twitter app, that isn't live.\nPeriscope: Live video taken via the Periscope app, or directly on the Twitter app .\nPeriscope Producer: High-end, live video streamed directly to the Periscope app, which can be shared to Twitter as well.\nFor the broadcaster, they've now got access to show professional content to Twitter's 310 million monthly active users (and anyone logged-out who chooses to access the site, or app). That's a much smaller audience compared to Facebook's nearly 2 billion monthly active users, but for some brands, that's good enough.\nFor example, PBS NewsHour has partnered with Twitter to share live video. Twitter, in its blog post on the announcement, also spotlighted Wild Earth, a daily safari which streams to Periscope.\n\"He’s not a celebrity, but his content is fucking awesome.\"\nPeriscope CEO Kayvon Beykpour had endorsed the channel , as well, in conversation with us earlier this year:\n\"He’s not a celebrity, but his content is fucking awesome. I go to bed and watch this,\" Beykpour said. \"Every night I go to bed at 10 p.m. and then every morning at 9 a.m. they’re producing professional produced safaris in real-time.\"\nFor Twitter, Periscope Producer offers another way to share.\nBut, as noted above, it's also left people confused on what Periscope has become. As we reported last month, the thought at the top of many creators' minds: \"In the wake of Twitter's decision to give up on Vine, there's a question that is hanging over Periscope: Could it be next?\"\nBeykpour says Periscope disappearing isn't gonna happen anytime soon. Indeed, as of today, Twitter has another product with the Periscope name.\nTwitter also chalked up a bunch of partners to help them promote the new feature. Telestream’s Wirecast software lets you control multiple devices including iOS and desktop cameras. Livestream’s Mevo camera has already been used as well as Switchboard Cloud ’s web platform.\nOne important aspect Twitter didn't discuss in its blog post or in conversation with us is monetization on the platform. Meanwhile, Facebook cut up big checks last year to a bunch of celebrities and media partners, and they're now experimenting with ad breaks in live videos.\nTwitter's always been true to its core of not paying people to tweet, despite conspiracy theories that Kanye West receives some checks. That's come at a cost, however. During the time when Twitter desperately attempted to keep Vine afloat, the app's top creators suggested offering them money per video. But, the company refused. Cue: R.I.P. Vine .\nWhat'll happen to Periscope? And Twitter, at large, for that matter? Maybe you'll be able to watch it live, with all the production values your heart could possibly desire.\nWATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge WATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge WATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge WATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge WATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge WATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge", "external_links": ["http://t.sidekickopen61.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XX4RJm1RW65jJnP5vwbYvW4Wzrfn56dByvf25XrX602?t=https%3A%2F%2Fswitchboard.live%2F&si=4859057579229184&pi=a0469781-ad9f-412b-bdd2-d0b12e04ac85", "https://twitter.com/biz/status/21", "https://blog.twitter.com/developer%20", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/bpG6bH19.jpg", "https://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm", "https://twitter.com/jack/status/20", "https://getmevo.com/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/bpG6bH19.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-21T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:12:53.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
