Only five units will be produced by the end of the year, as the automobile is intended for collectors and visionary enthusiasts, combining racing car features and performance alongside type-approval for use on normal roads.\nPredominantly constructed from carbon fiber, the car boasts a 5.2-liter V10 engine, taking you from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.2 seconds.\n“The exterior is characterized by the two sides of the same medal,” said Filippo Perini, Head of Innovation Design. “Above the tornado line, outlines are distinctly softer and smoother in keeping with the Italian Gran Turismo tradition. The lower part is modeled from aerodynamics. To achieve the performances we had in mind, we had to dare beyond all limits from styling and even purely technical points of view. The outcome ensures extremely high impact without ever being design for design’s sake.”\nIn providing further insight, Italdesign Chief Technical Officer Antonio Casu revealed,“The development of the one-off was based on the know-how achieved in the designing of hundreds of cars in our 49-years history. To reach the timing target we applied the latest CAx and Simulation Technologies. Styling has been integrated since the very beginning with early engineering and production processes. All this allowed us to produce a state-of-the-art car in terms of performance and safety.”\nCustomers will then have the opportunity to customize the car to their liking, thanks to finishing and performance packages.\n“Important for us was to run this project based on our development and production process for Ultra Low Series Cars,” Massimo Martinotti, Head of Project Management and Business Development, stated. “With this and a precise milestone tracking we achieve an outstanding quality and a very short time to market. We think that we can set with this process as a benchmark that we are looking forward to repeating for all current or future OEM customers.”\nJust yesterday we got an early glimpse at the 2018 Range Rover Velar and its massive glass roof. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:53:09.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
