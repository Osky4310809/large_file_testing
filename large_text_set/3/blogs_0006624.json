This is the result of 12 months of above average sea temperatures across the Reef. Brett Monroe Garner / Â© Brett Monroe Garner / Greenpeace ID: 10674812 “We can no longer expect these things [coral bleaching events] to be future events. They are happening now,” Hughes warned.\n\nEnvironmental groups have heavily criticised the proposed construction of the world’s largest coal mine in Queensland’s Galilee Basin, which will produce 60 million tonnes of coal a year and significantly contribute to Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions.\nAdani’s Carmichael coal mine has the backing of the federal and Queensland state governments, who say it will create thousands of jobs. But environmental groups say it will destroy the reef, taking millions of tourist dollars with it.\n“We have on our doorstep the clearest signal that climate change is happening, and that governments aren’t moving fast enough to stop it. We can still stop the Reef’s destruction if we dramatically reduce global emissions,” Alix Foster Vander Elst, a campaigner for Greenpeace Australia Pacific.\n\n“While the reef is fighting for its life, the Australian government is funding its destruction. Tackling climate change is the only real solution here, and that starts by stopping public funding for climate-killing coal projects.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:09:37.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
