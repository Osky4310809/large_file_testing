So it‚Äôs no surprise that for me, a professional jet-setter, most of the year‚Äôs highlights were far away from home. Here are the five places that stole my travel-editing heart over the last 12 months ‚Äîsome classic, some new, but all ones you should consider for yourself, too.\nEarly üê§ gets the ‚òÄÔ∏è #tlpicks #tleditors #heaven\nA photo posted by Nikki Ekstein (@nikkiekstein) on Mar 20, 2016 at 9:23am PDT\nCabo San Lucas, Mexico I‚Äôd long overlooked Cabo as a nightlife hub that was way farther from New York than low-slung Tulum. But I‚Äôm officially a convert to what‚Äôs really one of the great resort destinations on earth, second only to such places as Phuket or the South Pacific. Truth is, Cabo has some of the most compelling farm-to-table projects in Mexico, a ubiquitous knack for fried fish tacos, and‚Äîsince they were all redone right after Hurricane Odile struck in 2014‚Äîone of the highest concentrations of gleaming, new five-star resorts under the sun. Pile on Cabo‚Äôs natural splendor (stunning rock formations, cliffside beaches, whale watching, waterfalls, you name it) and its propensity for excellent swim-up bars, and you‚Äôll find a place where it‚Äôs hard to complain about anything.\nRecreate my trip: Plan a long weekend in Cabo as a respite to cold winter temps. That‚Äôs when you‚Äôll have the best chance at spotting mama and baby whales in the Sea of Cortez. Angle for a stay at One & Only Palmilla , where you‚Äôre waited on hand-and-foot in unparalleled fashion, or Auberge‚Äôs Esperanza , for more of a romantic honeymoon vibe.\nCalm before the storm. @pure_theshow #changeworlds\nA photo posted by Nikki Ekstein (@nikkiekstein) on Sep 12, 2016 at 2:21am PDT\nMarrakesh, Morocco My husband and I first visited Morocco as freshly minted college grads ‚Äî we spent less than $70 per night on accommodations that reliably took our breath away (not just because we were starry-eyed and unaccustomed to luxury). It‚Äôs been one of our favorite trips.\nNearly a decade later, Marrakesh was every bit as spectacular as my memory had made it out to be, though this time, I saw it a little differently. First was the fact that I inadvertently arrived in time for Eid, a feasting holiday that involves the public slaughter of many, many sheep. I missed the bloodbath but saw plenty of the lead-up and spent several days chatting with taxi drivers and shop keepers about their celebrations. I tried my first hammam, which I‚Äôd been loathe to do the first time around, since my then-boyfriend and I would have had to split up. (A friend described it to me as a gleeful regression to childhood, where you‚Äôre being scrubbed like a baby at bath time. She hit the nail on its head.) And I made my best purchase of the year: a multi-colored, hand-woven rug from a collective in the Rif Mountains, which I found with the help of my local guide, Mohammad. The upgraded hotels were just icing on the cake.\nRecreate my trip: The jaw-dropping resorts outside the old city may be tempting, but be sure to spend most of your trip in the medina itself. I loved my stay at the city‚Äôs grand dame, La Mamounia , right outside the Djemaa El Fna‚Äî it‚Äôs the epitome of an urban resort. Then, if you want to soak up some sun and escape the city‚Äôs frenetic pulse, decamp to the palatial Mandarin Oriental , or better yet, head up to the Atlas Mountains for a taste of the Kasbah life.\nLast day in the company of these cute critters. Today, Cuzco. Tomorrow, Bogota!\nA photo posted by Nikki Ekstein (@nikkiekstein) on Nov 11, 2016 at 3:56am PST\nMachu Picchu, Peru My drive for visiting under-explored places took me to Ecuador‚Äôs cloud forest and the coffee farms of Brazil long before I set sights on Machu Picchu, but the wait was worth it. It doesn‚Äôt matter that you‚Äôve seen hundreds of the exact same photos of this iconic world wonder ‚Äî in the flesh it still leaves you breathless. Plus, the photos don‚Äôt show you that dozens of llamas still live in the Lost City of the Incas full-time, which I found terribly entertaining.\nRecreate my trip: With so many incredible hikes in the Sacred Valley area, there‚Äôs no need to join the crowds on the full-blown Inca Trail. Instead, take the Vistadome train to Aguas Calientes and plan to get your park entry scanned by noon. That way, you‚Äôll miss the morning crowds but still have time to walk the grounds twice ‚Äî for photos in both midday and afternoon light.\nSpringtime in Paris really is all it's cracked up to be‚Äîespecially when you catch accidental views like these, all awash in purple. Hard to say goodbye! üå∏üåøüòç . . . #travel #travelgram #travelpics #tlpicks #beautifuldestinations #paris #france #spring #vacation #europe\nA photo posted by Nikki Ekstein (@nikkiekstein) on May 13, 2016 at 8:15pm PDT\nParis Counter-intuitive as it sounds, I‚Äôd never wanted to go to Paris more than I did in the wake of last year‚Äôs terrorism attacks. Tourism was plummeting and planning a trip felt like more than just a springtime indulgence; it was also my version of showing solidarity. Since tourism is still struggling to rebound in the City of Light, let me twist your arm to do the same: The croissants at Sebastien Gaudard will change your life, neo-bistros such as Clown Bar will make you feel like a (very well fed) local, and the city‚Äôs most illustrious hotels are all ready to impress. To wit: the Ritz Paris came back online shortly after my visit, Rosewood‚Äôs legendary Crillon will reopen this summer after a years-long renovation, and the Peninsula , where I stayed, has just been given palace designation. And what‚Äôs more inspiring than this view of the Eiffel Tower surrounded by purple blooms?\nRecreate my trip: Even if you‚Äôre not sleeping in the 16th arrondissement, it‚Äôs worth going out of your way to hit Le Patisserie Cyril Lignac , where I ate the best sandwiches I think I‚Äôve ever tasted; they‚Äôre made with top-notch charcuterie and fresh-from-the-oven baguettes. Take them to the Jardins du Trocad√©ro to get the view shown above, and then pay a visit to the grande dame of cheesemaking, Marie Anne Cantin , for a follow-up picnic in the 7th.\nFirst view of the San Juans. üö¢üèù\nA photo posted by Nikki Ekstein (@nikkiekstein) on Jul 18, 2016 at 3:26pm PDT\nThe San Juan Islands, Washington This little chain of islands off Washington‚Äôs northwest coast had something of a mythical appeal to me. Everyone I knew who had been there was taken by their beauty and bounty, but the islands seemed like places that simply had to speak for themselves. ‚ÄúYou just have to go,‚Äù people would constantly say. So I did. As the ferry crawled from the port town of Anacortes to tinier-than-tiny Lopez Island, the land masses grew increasingly verdant and became draped in swooping clouds, as if we were sailing into a dream. Ultimately we landed somewhere straight out of the 1960s: a place where you can get burgers in red plastic baskets and ice cream from old-timey windows before hiking to a private beach cove with your free-loving Ph.D. neighbors.\nRecreate my trip: Sorry, dear readers, this one‚Äôs all mine. Sure, you can bypass Lopez for Lummi Island, where the acclaimed Willows Inn awaits. But I‚Äôd highly advise bypassing the traditional hotel. Instead, befriend someone with relatives in the San Juans ‚Äî ideally ones with access to kayaks, which you can use to visit sea lions and fish for Dungeness crab. Then round up a group you love and go, en masse, for a back-to-basics getaway you‚Äôll never forget.\nBONUS: This German chef knife is made out of wood This article originally published at Bloomberg here", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BKQCrVpgkKa/", "http://www.sebastiengaudard.com/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-30/the-five-places-that-stole-my-heart-in-2016", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-16/best-new-luxury-hotels-in-paris-ritz-peninsula-le-meurice-le-roch", "http://www.crillon.com/en/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BIBP-rqh6Z9/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BFX0pdYKjBW/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/sADuBnQe.m3u8", "http://www.eater.com/2016/10/19/13314418/paris-clown-bar-veal-brain", "http://www.perurail.com/trains/vistadome/", "https://esperanza.aubergeresorts.com/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BDLnHRfqjHU/", "https://www.mashpilodge.com/en/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/sADuBnQe.jpg", "http://paris.peninsula.com/en/default", "https://www.willows-inn.com/", "https://www.oneandonlyresorts.com/one-and-only-palmilla-los-cabos", "http://www.mandarinoriental.com/marrakech/", "http://www.cantin.fr/?lang=en", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BMq0GlYgUmi/", "http://www.lapatisseriecyrillignac.com/en/", "http://www.mamounia.com/en/"], "published": "2017-01-09T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T19:09:07.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
