On the Monday, January 16, episode of Teen Mom 2 , the moms all had different domestic struggles. From Jenelle Evans ’ fight to bring son Jace home, to Leah Messer ’s West Virginia town being hit by a flood, there were plenty of problems, but few quick fixes. PHOTOS: Teen Mom Stars, Then and Now! \nLeah’s Kid Is MIA \nAs the single mom was preparing to move herself and her three girls into their new home, Leah’s town was hit by a devastating flood. Her family was fine, but Jeremy Calvert ’s parents’ home was wrecked. PHOTOS: Celebrity Splits of 2016 \nWhile she stressed out about trying to push back her move-in date and volunteer with local-aid efforts, Jeremy took daughter Adalynn, since he was back in town to help his parents and hadn’t seen their child in a while. Out of nowhere, he took Addie with him on a trip to Ohio and wouldn’t answer Leah’s calls. PHOTOS: Biggest Costar Feuds Ever! These Celebrities Can’t Stand Each Other Off-Screen \n“We’re supposed to get another flash flood warning, and she’s in another city, and I know nothing!” fumed Leah, who texted Jeremy and begged him for better communication. When she finally heard from him, he was defensive, and in her words, “lied his way out” of the conversation about why he was being so hard to reach while he had their child in another state. Chelsea see's her babies heartbeat MTV \nJenelle’s Kid Is Still in Barb’s Custody \nWhile still in Orlando on vacation, Jenelle took Jace to Legoland! They had so much fun that the mom of two wanted to keep Jace with her a little longer. \nToo bad Barbara Evans had other plans. As the one with custody of Jace, Jenelle’s mom wanted him back with her right away. Her insistence that Jace be returned to her immediately after the Orlando trip led to a huge fight. \nThis episode didn’t give Us a resolution, but we’re sure the battle will continue. Janelle MTV \nChelsea’s Kid Is on the Way \nPregnant Chelsea Houska was eager to make her big baby announcement, but wanted to wait until after her first sonogram. She actually bought herself a machine, so she could hear the fetal heartbeat whenever she wanted, but even hearing that didn’t ease her nerves. \nLuckily, Chelsea’s sonogram proved that the pregnancy was going just fine, so she was free to share the happy news. \nAfter she posted the announcement to social media, she squealed and celebrated with her fiancé, Cole DeBoer, her daughter Aubree and a producer. LEAH MTV \nKailyn’s Kid Feels Confused \nKailyn Lowry took her children to Puerto Rico ahead of her husband, Javi Marroquin , returning from deployment. They had already filed for divorce, but she was still anxious about seeing him. \nWhen she got back, ex Jo Rivera came over, and the two chatted about whether she was bad at relationships. He said “no comment,” but made a point to tell her he doesn’t want the dynamic to change between himself, Javi and the sons they share with Kailyn. Kailyn MTV \nLater, she finally told the kids that when Javi got back, he wouldn’t be living with them anymore. Lincoln and Isaac took it well, but Isaac was confused about why only Lincoln would be going over to Javi’s new house for the week.
