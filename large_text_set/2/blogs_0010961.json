A similar trick seems to work for the recently released set of generation two critters. \nThe Silph Road ‏recently reported that if you rename your eevee Tamao before you evolve it then it will evolve into an Umbreon. Likewise, if you name your eevee Sakura it will turn into Espeon. We were able to confirm that this trick works when we tested it ourselves. Hopefully you stockpiled a few extra eevees. Happy Pokémon hunting!
