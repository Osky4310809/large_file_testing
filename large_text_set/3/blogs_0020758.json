Morgan has his own history of controversial comments about women , and recently suggested a \"Men's March\" in opposition to the \"rabid feminists\" participating in January's Women's March on Washington. \nHawking's views on women's rights, on the other hand, proved more progressive. Morgan broached the subject by mentioning that the five most powerful people in the UK are all women — the queen, Prime Minister Theresa May, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, and Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick. \n\"Is this the clearest scientific evidence we've had yet of gender equality?\" he asked. \nThis was Hawking's response: It is not scientific proof of gender equality that is required, but general acceptance that women are at least the equals of men, or better. This is coming. If we factor in high-powered women in Europe as well, such as Angela Merkel, it seems we are witnessing a seismic shift for women to accede to high-level positions in politics and society. I welcome these signs of women's liberation. But there may still be a gap between those women achieving high public status and those in the private sector. \nWhen Morgan went on to ask Hawking if he is a feminist, his answer was a straightforward one. \"Yes, I have always supported women's rights,\" he said. \"I moved the admission of women to my college, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The results were wholly good.\" \nOne subject for which Hawking does look to science is climate change. In the same interview, he asked United States President Donald Trump to take environmentalism seriously, suggesting he replace Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA. \"Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it's one we can prevent.\" You can watch Stephen Hawking's full interview with Piers Morgan below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:52:42.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
