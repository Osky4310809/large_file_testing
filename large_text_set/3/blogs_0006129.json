According to Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald , the Dolphins fielded \"a call or two,\" but aren't actively looking to deal the two-time Pro Bowler. Talk of Landry's availability began Monday when Jeff McLane of the Philadelphia Inquirer said the following on 97.5 The Fanatic, per 975 Mornings: 975 Mornings @975Mornings “One name I’ve been hearing is Jarvis Landry who could find himself on the trade block, Miami might like Stills more” - @Jeff_McLane 3/6/2017, 12:34:40 PM Kenny Stills is set to hit the free-agent market, and if Miami is unable to re-sign him, it will be left with Landry and DeVante Parker as the only established wideouts on the roster. Landry has developed into one of the NFL's best slot receivers since entering the league as a second-round pick out of LSU in 2014. The 24-year-old has topped 1,100 yards in each of the past two seasons, and he reeled in 94 receptions in 2016 after registering 110 the previous season. Landry doesn't find the end zone often with just 13 touchdowns in three seasons, but he keeps the chains moving and is quarterback Ryan Tannehill's most reliable target. Perhaps the only logic in trading Landry is the fact that he will become a free agent in 2018 and require a significant raise from the less than $900,000 salary he'll make in 2017, according to Spotrac . With no viable replacement available, however, Miami is best off keeping him around as one of the NFL's best values in 2017 and attempting to reach the playoffs for the second consecutive year.
