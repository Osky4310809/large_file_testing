As kids we used them to keep our big pants in place, and our fashionable mothers used them to appear like they have an hourglass figure. So, when we were moving towards body positivity and accepting who we are, we threw the belts in the air and celebrated womanhood in all sizes. Or, maybe they just went out of fashion! But recently, designers all over the world, the icons of street style fashion, and celebrities displayed how belts are not a mere tool of optical illusion anymore, but a beautiful accoutrement that needs a special drawer in your closet. From dainty, slim fabric strips, to chunky and studded pieces of raw leather, belts have made a huge comeback. It is amazing how a boring outfit can move towards the glam section with the use of a statement belt. They are here not just to cinch your waist but also to put in place your ancient style sensibilities. Much like pieces of statement jewellery, belts are now like the fancy icing on the cake. These recent celebrity looks are here to add credibility to our argument! 1. Anushka’s never-ending belt. 2. Sridevi’s Gucci piece. 3. Deepika’s bold and black. 4. Shilpa’s iconic green! 5. Neha’s one of a kind belt. 6. Taapsee’s much need touch. 7. Kirti’s chunky old treasure. 8. Kiara’s cowboy inspired brown belt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:18:08.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
