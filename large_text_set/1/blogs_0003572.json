According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, requests for home loans were down 12% to close out the year. While part of that decline may be attributed to the holidays, several other factors may have put a damper on buying a home in the new year. Rising Interest Rates & Mortgage Applications \nIn mid-December Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen announced that the Fed would raise the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to between 0.50% and 0.75%. That move was prompted in part by a desire to keep pace with a growing economy , rising wages and low unemployment . \nWhen interest rates increase, the cost of buying becomes more expensive. (For more, see The Impact of the Fed Interest Rate Hike .) \nFor example, a home buyer who qualifies for a $200,000 mortgage at a 3.25% interest rate would pay roughly $870 a month, assuming a 30-year loan. That doesn’t include escrow for property taxes , private mortgage insurance or homeowners insurance . If that rate were to increase to 3.75%, the base payment would climb to $926. Once the escrow is added in, the final payment amount could make homeownership unaffordable for some buyers. (For more, see Understanding the Mortgage Payment Structure .) Home Prices Are Rising, Too \nThe housing market continues to make a steady recovery, and one of the key indicators is a jump in home prices. A recent CoreLogic report found that home prices increased by 7% year over year between November 2015 and November 2016. \nThat trend is set to endure for 2017, albeit at a slightly slower pace. CoreLogic forecasts an increase of 4.7% in home prices year over year through November, due largely to the anticipated impact of higher interest rates. Again, as homes become more expensive the pool of buyers could shrink. (For more, see How Interest Rates Affect Property Values. ) Tough Lending Standards Can Hurt \nA third issue that could be behind the drop-off in mortgage applications is the fact that qualifying for a home loan continues to be challenging for certain buyers. A report from the Urban Institute estimates that tight lending standards prevented 5.2 million mortgages from becoming a reality between 2009 and 2014. \nThis was the case even though a substantial share of borrowers saw their credit scores improve. The Urban Institute’s data show that roughly 70% of new-purchase borrowers in 2014 had a FICO score of 700 or higher, while a little more than 10% had a score of 660 or below. Those numbers represent a decline of 7.5% and 77%, respectively, from 2001 to 2014. \nThe question of credit can be especially tricky for younger buyers, who may not have had as much time to build up a solid credit history. According to Experian, M illennials ​ have the lowest credit scores of any generation, with an average VantageScore ​ of 625. The minimum credit score required for a conventional loan backed by Fannie Mae is 620, which leaves very little wiggle room for Millennials who have less-than-perfect credit. Even if they’re able to qualify for a loan, they’re likely to pay higher interest rates, which will affect how much home they can reasonably afford. The Bottom Line \nAs 2017 gets underway it will be interesting to see whether mortgage applications rebound ahead of the spring buying season. There’s speculation that additional rate hikes will follow the December 2016 one. The Fed has adjusted its initial projections from two rate increases to three over the next year. \nFor would-be home buyers, the big question is whether to pull the trigger and apply for a mortgage before rates take another climb or wait to see if the pressure on home prices eases off. One possibility is that sellers may be motivated to reduce their asking prices if buyer demand begins to drop because of rate hikes. For now, buyers, sellers and real estate investors should watch closely to see how the market develops in the months ahead.
