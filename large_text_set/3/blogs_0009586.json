He said it was however important to know the true status of Buhari’s health so as to avoid embarrassment among the comity of nations. \nHe said, “There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the state of health of President Buhari and many Nigerians, particularly the over 70 per cent of the Yoruba people, who voted him into office, are even being denied information about the President’s state of health. \n“As much as we wish him speedy recovery and good health to continue the good work he has started in the country, we want to say that the President must ensure he takes as much rest as he needs if he finds himself still unhealthy enough for the rigours of the office. \n“The health of the President is more important to the nation. As such, we call on the National Assembly to set up a committee or panel to investigate the fitness and health status of the President, so that Nigerians will know the level of support to offer him.” \nOn the Ile-Ife crisis, the group called on the Governor of Osun State, Rauf Aregbesola, security operatives, particularly the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to set up an investigative panel to get the perpetrators and bring them to justice. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:20:50.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
