Sources: Sean McVay had a second meeting with the #Rams . Interviewed for head coaching job last week. Things heating up in L.A. \n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 11, 2017 \nThis comes on the heels of NFL.com’s Mike Silver reporting that McVay had “crushed” both his first-round interviews with the Rams as well as with the San Francisco 49ers. Related: Washington OC Sean McVay reportedly 'crushed' his interview with the Rams \nAll indications at this point are that McVay is a finalist for the job. \nAccording to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, he’s already started considering who he would like to bring in as his defensive coordinator: Wade Phillips. If Sean McVay lands the Rams' HC job, his top option for DC would be Broncos DC Wade Phillips, per league sources. \n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 11, 2017 \nThings just got real, folks. Wade Phillips is one of the NFL’s most lauded defensive coordinators — a vacancy the Rams have with Gregg Williams now in Cleveland. \nAlex Marvez reported that Phillips was being eyed by the Cleveland Browns before they decided to move forward with former Rams DC Gregg Williams. Source tells @sn_nfl that @Browns making change at defensive coordinator. Offered job to Gregg Williams; Wade Phillips also contacted \n— Alex Marvez (@alexmarvez) January 6, 2017 \nIf the Rams have done anything well recently, it’s to build a defense with some serious potential for explosiveness. \nIn his forty years as an NFL coach, Phillips has been a part of twenty top-10 defensive units. Related: Should Rams hire Washington offensive coordinator Sean McVay as coach? \nOver the last two seasons he has been at the helm of the Denver Broncos defense; a unit that all but single-handedly won Super Bowl 50. \nHere’s what Phillips said about defensive schemes, considering the Broncos run a 3-4 but the Rams run a 4-3 ( via Denver Post ): \n“We try to fit what the players can do in the defense rather than saying, ‘OK, we’re a 4-3 or we’re a two-gap 3-4.’ We’re a team where if a guy can stunt and rush the passer, we let him do that. If a guy is a power guy, we try to let him be that. It’s all what individual players can do.” \nAdditionally, the Broncos are nearing a deal to hire Miami Dolphins DC Vance Joseph as their new head coach. \nJoseph reportedly has plans to promote current Broncos defensive backs coach to defensive coordinator. If/when Vance Joseph gets @Broncos HC job, @sn_nfl is told DBs coach Joe Woods would be promoted to DC replacing @sonofbum . \n— Alex Marvez (@alexmarvez) January 5, 2017 \nThis move would leave Phillips looking for a new home, making him a perfect target for the Rams job. \nIt’s an enticing prospect, particularly because of his expertise coaching up some of the best defensive lines over the last twenty years.
