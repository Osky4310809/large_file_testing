Close to 3,500 signatures were collected on online petitions, and the hashtags #FreeLupita, #WhyIResist and #GuadalupeGarcia were used to generate support on Twitter.\nRayos’ family blames President Trump’s executive order to deport illegal immigrants who have been convicted, charged or suspected of committing crimes for the woman’s deportation.\nDuring the Wednesday night demonstration, Rayos’ 16-year-old son, Angel, told the crowd, “My mom did nothing wrong. My mom is not a criminal.”\nBut Rayos does have a criminal record because of her conviction on a felony charge of identification theft. She was arrested during one of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s workplace raids.\nICE officials said Rayos’ removal under a voluntary deportation order was finalized by the Department of Justice in May 2013.\n“Ms. Garcia De Rayos is currently being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) based on a removal order issued by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review which became final in May 2013,” read the ICE statement. “Relevant databases indicate Ms. Garcia De Rayos has a prior felony conviction dating from March 2009 for criminal impersonation.”\nRayos’ husband, who asked that his name not be used, said she had worked out an agreement with the Department of Justice under the Obama administration and everything was going well until Trump moved into the Oval Office.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2017/02/09/phoenix-mayor-slams-trump-deportation-of-mexican-born-mother-of-two-as-travesty/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.12news.com/news/politics/family-of-mesa-mom-facing-deportation-vows-to-fight-for-her/406067638", "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/arizona-mom-may-be-facing-deportation-due-to-trump-order.html", "http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2017/02/08/could-woman-first-arizonan-deported-because-trump-orders/97637928/"], "published": "2017-02-10T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:27:45.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
