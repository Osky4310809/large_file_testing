They never do these things.” Expand Photo: Eva Al Desnudo \nThe result is a somewhat experimental looking sneaker, with A Cold Wall’s angular textual logo sewn on the outer edge of the foot, as well as the tongue. “A Cold Wall and Nike individually offer unique, innovative, and curated products that celebrate design culture as much as street culture,” added Ross. “It’s a tangible conversation.” \nThe shoes were made solely for the show—but, we imagine, Ross might rethink that decision and put them into production if demand is strong enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T01:00:56.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
