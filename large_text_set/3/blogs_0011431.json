(Photo: JessicaFarrar.org) More A Texas lawmaker has put forth a sarcastic new bill that would penalize men in the state for what are deemed “unregulated masturbatory emissions,” according to the document. State Rep. Jessica Farrar filed the satirical “men’s health” bill in response to potential laws filed by men regarding women’s health care. Farrar, a Democrat who represents the 148th distict in Houston, put forth House Bill 4260 after being angered about how women’s health care is being regulated in the state by legislation she feels is harmful. “A lot of people find the bill funny,” Farrar said in an interview with SF Gate . “What’s not funny are the obstacles that Texas women face every day, that were placed there by legislatures making it very difficult for them to access health care.” Farrar’s bill states that a man must remain abstinent and only make infrequent “emissions” inside health and medical facilities. If a man does so outside of these respective facilities, or without a female partner, he would have to pay a $100 fine, as it would be considered “an act against an unborn child, and failing to preserve the sanctity of life,” according to the legislation. Monies collected would go towards the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. In a tweet posted this weekend, Rep. Farrar wrote, “#HB4260, ‘A Man’s Right to Know,’ mirrors real Texas laws and health care restrictions faced by Texas women” every #txlege session” — which hammered home the stance she’s taking by addressing what she sees as gender health care inequality. #HB4260 , “A Man’s Right to Know,” mirrors real TX laws and health care restrictions faced by TX women every #txlege session. \n— Jessica Farrar (@JFarrarDist148) March 11, 2017 The response to the tweet has been largely positive, with one user writing, “ I just want to thank you & your staff. I know you’re all working hard for Tx women, & we truly couldn’t do it without y’all.” @JFarrarDist148 I just want to thank you & your staff.

Thank you for representing the women of your district with heart, integrity and a touch of humor. Cali stands w/u.” @JFarrarDist148 Brilliant!

Newman (@marmaladenewman) March 12, 2017 Others cited what they saw as issues with Farrar’s proposed legislation. @JFarrarDist148 No, it's a waste of taxpayer resources, it shows a lack of scientific understanding, &, worse than both, it's incredibly stupid. \n— just alan (@anythingbutdem) March 12, 2017 The bill also looks to provide men with safe environments for vasectomies, colonoscopies, and Viagra use via “A Man’s Right To Know” booklet, which would mirror the booklet “ A Woman’s Right To Know ,” which women are given before requesting an abortion. Farrar referred to the booklet as a way to guilt women out of terminating a pregnancy. Texas legislators have yet to weigh in on the bill.
