Oh, and Cher helped. \nNaturally, much of their celebration was posted to Instagram in real time, such as this Dynasty -esque moment in which Haynes hurdles Leatham into a pool. \nLeatham captioned the moment: “Sabotaged by #TeamLeatham and my LOVE @coltonlhaynes – forgiven BUT they are next” Sabotaged by #TeamLeatham and my LOVE ?? @coltonlhaynes – lol ???- forgiven BUT they are next – A post shared by JeffLeatham (@jeffleatham) on Mar 19, 2017 at 1:33pm PDT \n\n“An absolutely beautiful celebration for our loving journey ahead,” Haynes wrote. “Thx to all of our friends &a family for sharing your love with us.” An absolutely beautiful celebration for our loving journey ahead @jeffleatham . Thx to all of our friends &a family for sharing your love with us A post shared by Colton Haynes (@coltonlhaynes) on Mar 19, 2017 at 12:27pm PDT \nOverwhelmed by all of the love & support y'all have been sending @jeffleatham & I on our engagement. The fact that so many people love love as much as we do is truly inspiring and I feel so humbled. Who woulda thought that a lil ole kansas boy would meet a country boy from Utah & embark on journey that truly feels like one in the movies? I wish the same for everyone out there. No matter who you love…don't be afraid to love hard :) #whatmoviesaremadeof #LoveWins A post shared by Colton Haynes (@coltonlhaynes) on Mar 13, 2017 at 6:56am PDT \nI SAID YES!!! ???? @jeffleatham A post shared by Colton Haynes (@coltonlhaynes) on Mar 12, 2017 at 11:04am PDT \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:22:04.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
