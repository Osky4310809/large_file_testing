The Premier League will start on August 12th. \nThe east London club have requested to have their opening weekend played on the road before switching the designated home game the following match-day to their visitors’ ground - similarly to Liverpool this season. \nA club source told football.london: \"We have special dispensation to play the first game away from home, and then will seek to switch the second game, therefore will play the first three games away from home. Liverpool did the same this season due to their new stand.\" An Andy Carroll mural adorns the outside of the stadium, where Dimitri Payet was once pictured (Photo: West Ham United FC/Getty) Read More West Ham boss Slaven Bilic insists he has no interest in taking Joe Hart to the London Stadium \nSlaven Bilic's men only won one of their first seven Premier League games in the ground. \nThe Hammers pay an annual rent of £2.5 million on the 99-year lease at the former Olympic Stadium. \nInitially expected to cost £250 million to build, London Stadium's costs eventually tripled to £752 million.
