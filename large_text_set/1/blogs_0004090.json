(Supplied) \nWe now know which new song will be ushering in every Calgary Eyeopener radio show — and it has strong ties to Calgary. \nThe new song C-G-Y made its debut on Friday's show. \nThe original version was released in 2008 by local music producer Adam Hicks, who is also one-half of the hip-hop duo Dragon Fli Empire. \nHe says he and his sister grew up listening to the Calgary Eyeopener. \n\"She was air-fluting that theme back from the early to mid-80s,\" Hicks said. \nAlthough it never occurred to the DJ he would one day produce the show's theme himself, he says the honour is a little mind-boggling. \n\"Children now could be humming this 30 years from now,\" he said. \nHicks says the new track is meant to be peppier, more dynamic and upbeat. \nUrban Behaviours by Richard Dubuc has been the show's theme for the past 13 years. \nIt will be officially replaced on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:15:45.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
