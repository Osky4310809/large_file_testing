Gen. Michael Flynn said last year during the heat of the presidential campaign that people who accept immunity from the federal government “have probably committed a crime.” \nThose comments, which Flynn made about Hillary Clinton aides during a Sept. 25 interview on “Meet the Press,” took on new significance on Thursday, following a report from The Wall Street Journal that the former national security adviser has told the FBI and Congress that he is willing to be interviewed in exchange for immunity from prosecution. \n“Five people around [Clinton] have had, have been given immunity, to include her former Chief of Staff. When you are given immunity, that means that you have probably committed a crime,” Flynn told “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd. \nSeveral Clinton aides — including her former chief of staff Cheryl Mills, State Department lawyer Heather Samuelson, and her computer technician Bryan Pagilano — received immunity in exchange for their cooperation with the FBI investigation into Clinton’s private email server. No charges were filed against Clinton or any of her aides in the case. \nThe Daily Caller has not confirmed The Journal’s report that Flynn has asked for immunity, but Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, confirmed in a statement that he has been in discussions with congressional lawyers. \n“General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” Kelner said in a statement. \nFlynn was fired 24 days into his job as Trump’s national security adviser after it emerged that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about phone calls he had with Russia’s ambassador. Flynn also retroactively registered as a foreign agent of Turkey for work he did during the presidential campaign. \nWATCH:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:36:25.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
