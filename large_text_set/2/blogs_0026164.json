Jerry Brown and Democratic legislative leaders want to change that, and Californians would pay more as a result. \nIn what would be the biggest shakeup of state transportation funding since the early 1990s, they are trying to craft a package that would raise billions of dollars for road upkeep, goods movement and public transit, mostly through a mix of higher taxes and fees. \nDepending on how much a person drives, their car’s mileage and other variables, the Democratic proposals would cost the typical motorist anywhere from roughly $9 a month extra to more than $13 above existing charges. \n“I think it’s a matter of priorities and philosophies,” said Assemblyman Jim Frazier, D-Oakley, the author of one of the funding bills. “What we’ve tried to do was formulate something that would create balance for all the users in California, with the primary focus of maintaining our roads.” \nBrown and Democratic leaders working to come up with an agreement recently set a deadline for April 6, when lawmakers leave for spring recess and before the annual budget process begins to dominate the Capitol. Officials point to tens of billions of dollars in road maintenance and repair backlogs, with this month’s crisis at Oroville Dam presenting a case study of what can happen as public works age. \nYet hopes for a transportation deal still could be optimistic. Brown called a transportation special session almost two years ago, and multiple hearings and lobbying by an influential coalition of cities, counties, businesses and labor groups have failed to produce agreement. \nOfficials have disagreed on the size of any funding package and what the additional money should pay for. The biggest stumbling block, though, has been the prospect of higher taxes. \nRepublicans have criticized the proposed tax increases, recommending that the state reallocate its existing money to pay for roads. They haven’t said which programs they would cut in exchange. \nAssembly Republican leader Chad Mayes of Yucca Valley, said his members have been largely excluded from the talks. \n“Either they’ve decided to go it alone, or they don’t want a transportation deal,” Mayes said. \nDemocrats achieved legislative super-majorities last November that allow them to raise taxes on their own, yet such votes historically are rare and politically perilous, particularly when they involve people’s cars. A restoration of higher vehicle license fees helped fuel the 2003 recall of Gov. Gray Davis. \nYou have to do it the right way. And I think our bill is the right way. \nState Sen. Jim Beall, D-San Jose, the author of SB 1 \nState Sen. Jim Beall, D-San Jose, the author of another funding bill, SB 1, said the backlog of road projects and their cost will only increase unless lawmakers act now. \n“I think the political reality is … we’ve had a series of governors who haven’t focused on the subject,” said Beall, chairman of the Senate transportation panel, one of three Senate policy committees assigned to review his bill. “The Legislature was turned into short-term legislatures, and the tendency was not to look long-term. \n“And the political risk of raising any of these things is very difficult,” he said. “You have to do it the right way. And I think our bill is the right way.”  ; \nThe similar bills by Beall and Frazier would generate almost $6 billion a year. They include a mix of higher taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, raising vehicle registration fees by $38, imposing a new charge on zero-emission vehicles, and other revenue. \nBrown, meanwhile, has put forward a plan that would generate an average of $4.2 billion annually over 10 years. It includes a smaller gas tax increase, while creating a new road-improvement charge of $65 on all vehicles. \nProponents of the Democratic bills conducted focus groups around the state to come up with the most palatable mix of new revenue. \n“It’s trying to address a large problem, and it’s doing it in a way that tries to spread the revenue increases across several fronts,” said Mark Watts of Transportation California, who has been involved in crafting the Assembly and Senate bills. \nThe bulk of the billions raised would go to pay for state and local road maintenance and repairs. Public transit and goods movement projects also would receive several hundred million dollars. In addition, some money would go to the state program that pays for new roads and other expansion projects. \nAny agreement would be the biggest transportation funding measure in more than a decade. \nIn 2006, voters approved Proposition 1B, a $19.9 billion borrowing measure to build new roads, improve goods movement and reduce congestion. Backed by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and a bipartisan coalition, it received more than 61 percent of the vote and passed in all but two legislative districts. \nBrian Kelly, Brown’s transportation secretary, helped negotiate the 2006 bond legislation. The latest talks are more difficult – “It’s easier to get a vote for a bond than a tax” – but more important to the state’s transportation system, he said. \n“We’ve ignored some of the fundamentals for too long,” Kelly said.  ; \nFunding for California road and related projects once followed a fairly simple path. \nMotorists paid the gas tax, and that revenue paid for new roads and to maintain existing ones. Lawmakers raised the gas tax in 1982, and in 1990, voters approved Proposition 111, which phased in four years of gas tax increases, up to the current base rate of 18 cents a gallon in 1994. \nThe flow of dollars became increasingly constrained and convoluted during the chronic budget shortfalls of the 2000s and the recession, as lawmakers looked for ways to prevent cuts to general fund programs. \nLawmakers repeatedly shifted money from transportation accounts. In addition, the Legislature approved complicated tax swaps in 2010 and 2011 to shift the cost of paying Proposition 1B debt service away from the general fund. \nThe shortage of road money meant that some counties with transportation sales taxes sometimes had to front the state’s share. \nMeanwhile, the base gas tax’s real value declined over time. Today, it is worth less than two-thirds of what it was in 1994. In addition, low gas prices mean the tax created by the swap several years ago is about one-half its initial rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:46:18.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
