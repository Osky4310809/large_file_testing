And you see gang violence that you’ve read about like never before, all of the things, much of that is people that are here illegally. And they’re rough and they’re tough but they’re not tough like our people,” he added.\nThe comments came as the US’ top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Department of Homeland Security secretary, John Kelly, were in Mexico for a meeting with their counterparts.\n“Right now, Rex, who, as you know, he’s in Mexico. I said, ‘That’s gonna be a tough trip,’ because we have to be treated fairly by Mexico,” Trump said. “That’s gonna be a tough trip.”\nTrump had the business leaders introduce themselves and when he got to GE’s Jeff Immelt, he asked him to tell all assembled about the time he hit a hole in one. “Jeff actually watched me make a hole in one. Should you tell that story?”\nImmelt said the two had golfed during negotiations for the NBC show “The Apprentice,” with Trump telling him was the best richest golfer in the world.\n“I actually said I was the best golfer of all the rich people,” Trump said, correcting the CEO.\nOther CEOs at Thursday’s meeting included, Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical Company, Inge Thulin of 3M, Mark Fields of Ford and Mario Longhi and U.S. Steel.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:38:19.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
