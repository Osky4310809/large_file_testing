The banished shade will only be available in boxes that are already on store shelves.\nThough it hasn’t officially retired colors before, Crayola has discontinued and renamed hues, as thoroughly documented on website Crayon Collecting. \nCrayola introduced the controversial “flesh” color in 1949 but renamed it “flesh tint” and “pink beige” before finally settling on “peach”– as its known today, according to the website.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:53:47.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
