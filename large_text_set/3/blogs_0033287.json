I had no idea this was coming,” said Barnes, who is moving to Boston. “My wife took early retirement, we have a lot of family up in the Boston area,” said Barnes who added that while he’s “retiring from TV news he’s not retiring from work.” \nBarnes was the original co-host of FBN’s morning show Money for Breakfast. Seven months later, in 2008, Barnes moved to Washington D.C. as senior correspondent. \n“I just want to thank all my colleagues here, the best group of people that I have ever worked with,” said Barnes. \n“I wish you all the best my friend,” said Bartiromo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:38:44.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
