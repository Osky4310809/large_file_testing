Their sophomore album CULTURE is now the number one record in America, they have more TV appearances than they can count and apparently a collaboration with Drake is on the way. But all of these accomplishments pale in comparison to their latest: an official studio version of a song titled “Dab of Ranch.” Stream it below.\n\nRecorded for Spotify, “Dab of Ranch” is the culmination of the saga of a very bizarre video the trio made back in the fall. Created as a joke that only people who are very stoned seem to get, the video sees Migos in the studio freestyling over a beat about their delicious snacks which are best served with a, well, dab of ranch. Watch it below.\n\nIf there was any doubt as to whether Migos truly are this generation’s Beatles, look no further. Who else could spin such beauty from a song about ranch? \nRevisit the video for “Bad and Boujee” below.\n\nIn other music news, Juicy J has dropped a video featuring Wiz Khalifa and Ty Dolla $ign that is wild in about every way imaginable. Watch it right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:36:57.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
