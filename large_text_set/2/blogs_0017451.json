We are fascinated by their agility, speed, instincts and behaviors. It’s easy to see similarities big cats share with their smaller, domestic cousins in our homes. Pound for pound, both share tremendous strength, wonder and grace. Anyone who shares their life with a cat can agree that domestic cats carry the same independent streak that we see in big cats.\nDespite these and many more similarities, big cats and the smaller cats that live among us are often seen very differently in the public eye. Yet when we apply the same scientific lens that we use for big cats to the domestic cat species, Felis catus, we can benefit from some dramatically changed perspectives.\nCats in the Landscape\nSmall cats have always had a place in the natural landscape. As cat behavior expert John Bradshaw wrote , “Cats still have three out of four paws firmly planted in the wild, and within only a few generations can easily revert back to the independent way of life that was the exclusive preserve of their predecessors some 10,000 years ago.”\nThe ancestors of Felis catus first settled alongside humans in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East. As earliest human civilization began amassing stores of grain, the food attracted rodents, which in turn attracted cats. Since then, cats have traveled the world with humans, living side-by-side with us, most living self-sufficient lives outdoors. Today, we often refer to these outdoor cats, who don’t always rely on or seek close companionship with people, as feral or community cats.\nCats in our homes, by contrast, are a result of human influence. Only with the advent of spaying and neutering and the arrival of kitty litter just 60 years ago did it become practical for cats to live inside with us full-time. However, the cat’s history makes it very clear that it is just as natural for Felis catus to live outside as it is for lions and tigers, or, closer to home, for squirrels, raccoons and birds.\nFood and Survival\nAll cats choose to live near food and shelter. Just as big cats such as lions move to follow their food, community cats gravitate toward the food sources that are available near human development, as they did with ancient settlements thousands of years ago.\nSo it is no surprise that studies have shown feral cats eat discarded food, bugs and small rodents. When cats hunt, their successes are limited to animals that are convenient and easy to catch. When it comes to birds, according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , they are most often “weak or sickly” individuals. Predation is a normal process in nature that biologists explain plays a part in strengthening the prey species’ gene pool by ensuring the fittest survive to procreate.\nIn recent years concerns have been raised about what impact outdoor cats might have on wildlife populations. It’s important to remember that cats have been a part of the outdoors for thousands of years, and predation by cats, big and small, is a natural part of the ecosystem. The main threats to all species on our planet are habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and other human activities. The solutions to these problems rest in our hands. We humans need to adjust our behavior if we wish to see extinctions decrease. Condemning Felis catus ignores the real causes of species loss and is based on a disturbing ignorance of the feeding habits of stray and feral cats.\nCat name: Burt\nBalancing the Cat Population\nAccepting that cats around the country live outside with limited human contact is key to understanding and helping these animals. Just as many kind people feed birds to help them through winter, so too do others offer food and shelter for outdoor cats.\nPeople can further help cats through a process called Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) in which they humanely trap, spay or neuter, vaccinate, and return cats to their outdoor homes. TNR stabilizes cat populations, stops cats from breeding and making more cats, decreases euthanasia rates at shelters, keeps cats from being killed simply because they are unfriendly to humans and therefore unadoptable, reduces the number of calls of concern about cats that local governments receive, and saves taxpayer money. Even for those who are not interested in feral cats, this last point – saving taxpayer dollars – is a compelling reason to support TNR. For these reasons, TNR consistently produces the best results among all options available to coexist with community cats.\nOne approach that has repeatedly failed is catching and killing outdoor cats. After 100 years of catch-and-kill policies in cities across America, many people are finally understanding that it doesn’t work.\nHere to Stay\nWhen cats are removed from an ecosystem in a catch-and-kill program, neighboring cats move in to take advantage of the food and shelter. These new cats reproduce and the population rebounds. This is called the vacuum effect. Catching and killing cats is an endless cycle that is a waste of money. Millions of cats are killed year after year, yet feline populations persist.\nMore importantly, this is a compassionate country whose people don’t want cats rounded up and killed . When calls are made to round up and kill massive numbers of cats, time and again society balks. Our discomfort with government policies to catch and kill cats is compounded as we become aware that this lethal method is grossly ineffective and morally questionable.\nMore and more cities and towns across the nation have come to see that cats are part of the fabric of the modern American landscape. They are embracing TNR programs in numbers that have transformed it into the mainstream approach to humanely manage families of outdoor cats.\nEvery cat, big and small, should be valued and protected. We strive for a world where all domestic cats have a safe community in which to live, including those whose homes are outdoors.\nAlley Cat Allies is the only national advocacy organization dedicated to the humane treatment of cats.
