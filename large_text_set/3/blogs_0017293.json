Holmes just posted a doppleganger photo of Suri on Instagram, and honestly, baby girl is Holmes’ identical mini-me .\nIn the photo, Suri looks beyond stoked to be hanging out with her cousins in Los Angeles.\nHolmes captioned the pic, “ Love these sweethearts who inspire me with all of their accomplishments and beautiful hearts and for bringing so much light to all of our lives! #lalaland #losangeles#family #love #ontopoftheworld#followyourdreams” Love these sweethearts who inspire me with all of their accomplishments and beautiful hearts and for bringing so much light to all of our lives! #lalaland #losangeles #family #love #ontopoftheworld #followyourdreams \nA post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Mar 19, 2017 at 8:01am PDT \nDid Katie Holmes shrink or…? If you need further proof that Suri and mom are basically the same person, check out this #tbt picture Holmes posted on Instagram a few weeks ago. Keep in mind that the picture is of Katie, not Suri.\n#tbt my big brother and me #proudsister @stjohnsjesuit \nA post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Feb 16, 2017 at 7:08pm PST \nAnd also this #tbt of Holmes at age four: #tbt summer days Me at age 4 ☀️ \nA post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Jan 5, 2017 at 9:35pm PST \nAnd, while we have you here, please just also look at this #tbt of six-year-old Holmes: #tbt me at age 6 cheering on my sister's basketball team ❤️ #girlpower #family #sisters #ohio \nA post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Nov 17, 2016 at 10:39am PST \nWe’re not totally convinced that Holmes isn’t some sort of time-traveling clone or something! According to People Magazine, Suri has been spending a lot of time with Holmes on set of T he Kennedys: After Camelot, in which Holmes plays Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis. Director Jon Cassar said that Holmes even made Suri a director’s chair to hang out in on set.\nHanging in a director’s chair while your mom plays Jackie Kennedy Onassis is probably one of the coolest things a 10-year-old can experience, if you ask us (and Holmes is also directing several eps. NBD).\nBirthday vibes continued ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ so grateful today \nA post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Dec 18, 2016 at 7:35pm PST \nWe guess that old saying, “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree” rings true. This adorable little girl is growing into a beautiful woman just like her mama. But seriously, Suri, take your time growing up. The fact that you’re already 10 makes us feel ancient…\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:25:11.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
