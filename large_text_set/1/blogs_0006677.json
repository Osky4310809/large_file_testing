The twins were found with an urn containing their mother's ashes, it has been claimed (Photo: Stone Sub) \nWhen their mother died in 2014, the twins moved to the small village of Elton in Cheshire. \nA neighbour said: \"I heard the twins were found with her ashes. \n\"It’s not clear whether they slipped and fell as they tried to scatter them or if they jumped holding them – just wanting to be all together at the end.\" \nA family friend added: \"The twins were quiet but were also inseparable.\" Police found the body of Scott Enion at the same time as the twins' bodies were discovered (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nA coroner will ultimately rule whether the twins' deaths were intentional or not. \nIn the meantime, officers from Kent Police are still appealing for help to trace their final movements. \nThey were wearing dark-coloured wet weather gear and may have been seen at the top of the cliffs in the period between Boxing Day and New Year's Day. \nForty-five-year-old Scott Enion from Manchester has been revealed as the man whose body was also found at the bottom of the cliffs on January 1. \nOfficers have confirmed that they are not linking his death with those of the Burgess twins. Anyone with information that could help with the enquiry into the twins’ movements please contact Detective Sergeant Stuart Ward on 01843 222289, quoting incident number 01-980. \nIf you have been affected by this story you can contact Samaritans by clicking here or call 028 71265511 - local call charges apply.
