LOUIS • When a crime victim advocate asks police officers to write down the three things that matter most to them, the most common responses are: \nJob. Spouse. Children. \nThen Jessica Meyers pairs the officers up and tells them to have a conversation without mentioning those topics. That’s how she starts a three-hour long training program meant to show officers how gay, lesbian, transgender or bisexual crime victims may feel when talking to them. \n“It really appeals to police officers because they love to interrogate each other,” said Meyers, the director of Advocacy Services for the Crime Victim Advocacy Center of St. Louis. “But they soon find out that a simple question such as, ‘What did you do this past weekend,’ can force someone to make a choice: tell the truth and out themselves, lie or become evasive. \n“It shows them what it’s like to be closeted about something for fear of being outed.” \nThe training that some officers went through Thursday is a far cry from the department’s first documented gay sensitivity training in 1950, Meyers said. \nThe 1950 version included a reading from the book of Leviticus and the use of terms such as “sexual perversion.” Back then, most police encounters happened during raids at gay bars because homosexuality was illegal, she said. \nPolice Chief Sam Dotson could not recall how much training on the topic has taken place since then, and he acknowledged that Meyers’ training was “long overdue.” \nThose early roots have led LGBT victims of crime, such as domestic violence in same-sex partner relationships, to mistrust police and believe officers won’t help. They have also led some aggressors to use those stereotypes of officers to silence their victims, Meyers said. \nGay and transgender people are often victims of human trafficking, hate crimes and homelessness and are not as likely to call police when they are victims of domestic violence, she said. \n“A man might tell his male partner a police officer isn’t going to do anything for them because they don’t believe a man can be beaten by another man,” Meyers told a group of commanders at police headquarters. \nThe topic has become particularly relevant as President Donald Trump on Wednesday rescinded the Obama administration directive to let transgender students use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. The issue has put the unique issues that the gay and transgender community faces again in the spotlight, Meyers said. \nAnd earlier this month, a gay police officer drew national attention after he said in a lawsuit against the St. Louis County police department that he was told to “tone down” his “gayness” if he wanted a promotion. \nDotson said the training Meyers is running for the St. Louis police department has been in the works for months. It’s funded by the nonprofit Meyers works for. \n“I want our officers to have an awareness and understanding about how to communicate better at a time of crisis,” Dotson said. “I think this has been an enlightening and eye-opening experience for a lot of them.” \nAbout 30 officers in St. Louis and about 20 commanders have undergone the training, and there are plans to train the entire 1,200-member department by June. \nThe nonprofit offers its services to every police department, but so far the city’s force is the only one to undergo the training, which also asks officers to write down thoughts and beliefs about gay and transgender people to be read and discussed aloud in class. \nA lot of time in Meyers’ first class with officers Wednesday was devoted to whether homosexuality was a choice, and how officers’ own religious beliefs affect their decisions. \n“I’m not asking you to set aside your religious beliefs. I’m asking you to treat people with respect, because that is accepted by every religion,” Meyers said she told them. \nCapt. Angela Coonce serves as the department’s liaison to the gay and transgender community. \nShe said the department is looking internally to change policies and protocols to better serve gay and transgender residents. \nThe department requires officers to search people of their same gender, but now, the department will give transgender people a choice. Officers also are being trained to inform transgender people that they will have to refer to them by their biological sex in official paperwork, but can refer to them by their pronoun of choice in conversation.
