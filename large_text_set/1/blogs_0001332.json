For the health and for every individual and for the physical part of the point of view for everyone that is in the game, you need rest. \n“There’s no superman. There’s no strength that can recover from a game so fast, and I cannot do anything about it. If the coach wants me to play, I’ll play. \n“I feel good, but let’s be realistic. \n\"From a game, you need two or three days to recover. We’ve just recovered from the last game, played again and we have another game within 48 hours, so let’s be intelligent and recover good.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:53:04.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
