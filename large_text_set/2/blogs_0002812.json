One day, Park-Pettiford, recalls, he brought Brahim and his family a few essential toiletries from the PX, including soap. \"When I presented it to him, he cried,\" Part-Pettiford tweeted. \"Literally bawled his eyes out and said he give his life for me. OVER SOAP. Completely sobering.\" \nBrahim served as an interpreter and liaison for Park-Pettiford and his fellow airmen for a year, \"essentially saving (their) lives on a daily basis\" as he recalls. \nWhen Park-Pettiford's deployment was up, he had a feeling he'd never see the teenager again. At the end of my tour in Iraq, I knew I was leaving him to die. I knew I'd never see him again. Was just kinda like \"take care kid.\" \nA few years later, Park-Pettiford was out of the military. He found himself on his way from Hawaii to Arizona after his brother was murdered during a carjacking. \nUpon landing in Arizona, Park-Pettiford got into a cab at the airport. I get in the first taxi that pulls up and we're off. Driver starts to make the standard small talk.
