It is hot. Go slow.” I wished she had been there on my first visit, when I fished a pepper out of the jar and ate it whole. Time stuttered. In such heat, universes are born. Then, when I thought it was over, the throb started in my ribs, fire engulfing each one. “My mother carried hot sauce in her purse,” said Chris Scott, the chef of Butterfunk Kitchen in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. In her honor, he equips every table with a fury of Scotch bonnets — the black mambas of chiles — roasted alongside milder smoked poblanos until the skins are nearly ash, then left to rage in a pot all day with vinegar, garlic, sugar and cayenne. “So no one has to sneak in their own,” he said. Mr. Scott opened Butterfunk Kitchen in April with his wife, Eugenie Woo. They’re never late to work: They live with their two children upstairs, above the restaurant and the space they converted from a laundromat to a cafe, Brooklyn Commune , in 2010. Cafe and restaurant share a kitchen, and at dusk, when one goes dark, the other starts to glow. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Family photos crowd the wall at Butterfunk Kitchen, including portraits of Ms. Woo’s great-grandparents in South Korea and seven generations on Mr. Scott’s side, from antebellum Virginia, where his ancestors worked as slaves, to Pennsylvania Dutch country, where he grew up. He built his menu on memories of his nana’s cooking, church picnics and neighborhood potlucks. So here are deviled eggs, made wickeder by breading and deep-frying the whites, crunchy veneer giving way to wobble. The yolk mousse is piped high in spirals and trimmed with a collard green crisp.

It’s a state-fair snack, not fussily elevated but enriched, with an ooze of house-made ranch and slab bacon slapped on top. The sweet-sour corn chowchow below is a Pennsylvania Dutch tradition; Nana used to can it and keep a hoard in the basement. Mr. Scott takes some license with Nana’s scrapple. After simmering pig feet, smoked hocks and pork butt for hours with pork bones and mirepoix, he pulverizes the meat and skin in a Robot Coupe food processor before stirring it back into the strained broth. Nana thickened her mixture with buckwheat and a dusting of cornmeal; he splits the difference. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story And while she fried her scrapple with fat from an old coffee canister stashed by the stove, Mr. Scott primes the griddle with melted salt pork, then finishes the loaf in the oven. The crust has a touch of crackle; the inside is all velvet. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.
