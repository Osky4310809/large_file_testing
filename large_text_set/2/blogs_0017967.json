Maybe we should assess demonetisation.\nFM: The first thing we should assess is if demonetisation should have been called demanytisation.\nPM: Demanytisation? What do you mean?\nFM: It’s not what I mean that matters, it’s what you meant that matters. And you seemed to mean many things. To begin with you said demonetisation was aimed at flushing out all the black money.\nBut before anyone could say Doh Numberi Maal, you’d switched tracks and said that demonetisation was actually about getting rid of all the counterfeit Made-in-Pakistan notes that were sabotaging our economy and funding terrorism. Right?\nPM: Right. I kept thinking up new things that demonetisation was about. It was about flushing out black money and also about getting rid of counterfeit notes and terrorism. Ek ticket, doh mazaa. Or, rather, ek ticket, teen mazaa.\nFM: It was more like ek ticket, dozen mazaa. Because after fake Pakistani notes and terrorism, you said demonetisation was really about coming to the aid of public sector banks which were stressed by bad loans and non-performing assets.\nPM: Yup, I remember saying that too.\nFM: And right after you said that you went on to say that demonetisation was actually about lower interest rates and would promote business and industrial expansion. And having said that , you said that demonetisation was truly about being pro-poor and uplifting the rural economy. So, according to you, demonetisation was many things to many people. Which being the case it should be called demanytisation.\nPM: Hey, I like demanytisation. It shows I’m good at multi-tasking. Rather like those many-armed deities who do different things with all their different hands. Right?\nFM: Right. Except for one problem – in your case all your left hands didn’t seem to know what all your right hands were doing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:50:03.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
