Monday, 9 January, 2017 Deutsche Bank is looking to use platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn to connect with job candidates it might otherwise miss © FT Montage / Getty by: Laura Noonan , Investment Banking Correspondent \nDeutsche Bank has turned to social media feeds such as Twitter and LinkedIn to find promising millennials who could be persuaded to consider a career in finance. \nGermany’s biggest bank launched a programme late last year to monitor the online activity of university students to identify those who might be a good fit for the bank but would not apply through traditional channels such as on-campus recruitment drives. \nIn the first two weeks of the initiative in late November, a special team at the bank identified 250 potential hires, who were then encouraged to take part in the bank’s UK graduate recruitment programme. \nThe scheme — which Deutsche says is the first of its kind for a bank — is the latest attempt by Wall Street and European banking groups to move beyond their traditional hiring pool of economics and finance graduates. \nDeutsche turned to the scheme following a decline in the popularity of banking among top graduates and a recognition among executives that broader skills and experience could benefit banks by producing a staff more adept at challenging existing practices and innovating.

Deutsche hires about 750 graduates globally each year and has no target for the percentage of graduates who should be found through social media. \nThe bank has begun the programme in London and will then launch it in the US and Asia. Deutsche also uses behavioural profiling so that it can recruit from a broader range of graduates in the US. \nMore on changes in bank hiring", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:52:57.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
