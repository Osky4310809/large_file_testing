Now, when Priyanka Chopra shares a throwback picture with him on her Instagram, it is sure to give us the feels. We can't see their faces, thanks to the eye masks, but don't you think they'd make one fab couple onscreen? It would be fun to watch PeeCee romance the 17 Again hunk in a movie, or in a TV series. \nJust recently, the actress shared her poster from the upcoming film, Bayatch , with the tagline, 'Summer is coming'. Yes, she got creative, and the tagline surely fits the bill as we can't wait for this summer to come. So while Baywatch's poster became the talking point on social media, PeeCee shared yet another pic that would set the online medium buzzing. Her pic with Zac catching some sleep, while tucking themselves in, takes cute to another level! Although it's a pic that was taken during the time of shooting, we wonder what made the diva share it today. But, we can guarantee it's the cutest thing you will see today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T08:22:40.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
