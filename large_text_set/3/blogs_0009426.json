Trump indicated on the campaign trail that he believed the authority of such matters belonged to the states, not the federal government.   \nIt’s hard to disagree with that reasoning: The less involved the federal government is in our lives, the better off we will be. \nWhile the decision doesn’t necessarily kill the case, it will make it more difficult for transgender people to file anti-discrimination cases using Title IX law because the Education Department no longer equates “sex” with gender identity. \nTransgenders can, and probably will, still pursue cases based upon the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. \nWhile the court’s decision is a major setback for gender-bending leftists in America, it is a victory for conservatives, science and traditional values.
