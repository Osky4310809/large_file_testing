Plans raise the possibility", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Plans filed with the state have generated speculation that Walt Disney World is planning a cable car system on its property.\nRumors have circulated about such a project for months.\nReedy Creek Improvement District, the Disney-controlled government agency, submitted plans to the South Florida Water Management District this week for a project associated with “various building, roadway…and parking lot modifications.” Plans show buildings – including one with a V shape – that are elevated 100 feet.\nDisney isn’t disclosing more details yet. “At any given time, we have numerous projects in various stages of development across our resort. If a project moves forward, we will share details when it makes sense to do so for our business.”\nAccording to the plans, work will take place in spots including south of Epcot and Disney’s BoardWalk and east of Disney’s Hollywood Studios.\nBoth Epcot and Hollywood Studios are getting overhauls, with a Star Wars land set to open in 2019 at Hollywood Studios. Disney executives have said they plan big changes to Epcot, though they have not revealed what.\nTheme park fans who saw the permits on the WDWMagic.com website theorized the work could be for the rumored gondola lift system.\nTheir idea makes sense to Dennis Speigel, a theme park consultant whose firm recently worked on a project that included a cable car.\n“What we think it is is a gondola ride, a cable car,” Speigel said after inspecting the plans. “It makes sense.”\nSpeigel found the buildings’ locations and elevations particularly interesting along with the V-shaped building.Also, Speigel said, “they’re doing a fill-over the swamp area. That’s where we think they would be putting the free-span poles.”\nSpeigel’s company, International Theme Park Services, designed a project in Vietnam that includes a cable car ride across Ha Long Bay.\nHe said a cable car ride is “the way things are going now.”\nPatrick Radden, a construction project manager in Lexington, Ky., and a Disney fan, has analyzed the plans along with another frequent contributor to the WDWMagic site.\nThe two also looked at structures from other Reedy Creek permits and reached the conclusion Disney appears to be planning a cable car or gondola system.\n “We started noticing these odd structures being on these permits,” Radden said.“When we overlaid them onto maps we started noticing they connect on straight lines.”\nRadden said others on the site had talked about a skyway or gondola system, and “we took that and basically ran with it, put two and two together.”\nDisney did not answer requests for comment.\nReedy Creek District Administrator John Classe said the permit filed this week with the South Florida Water Management District was a joint one between his agency and The Walt Disney Co.\nClasse said he had no information on what the buildings depicted on the permit would be.\nDisney has not spoken with him about any new transportation system, he said. “I only know when they submit applications to us,” he said.\nAn engineering company that works on a variety of projects including transportation-related ones, Atkins, worked with Disney on the plans. Locally, Atkins has done work for the Central Florida Expressway Authority.\nDuncan Dickson, a former Disney executive, said a cable car system connecting parks or resorts would be cheaper than expanding the monorail system. “Anything you can do to get people off the roads is probably pretty intelligent,” he said.\nDisney has also been working on a series of road transportation projects to prepare for more traffic from its expansion.\nspedicini@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5240; Twitter @SandraPedicini\nCaption Disney sets 'Rivers of Light' debut and replaces 'Wishes' fireworks show “Rivers of Light,” the first nighttime spectacular planned for Disney’s Animal Kingdom, will debut Feb. 17, Walt Disney World announced Thursday morning.\n“Rivers of Light,” the first nighttime spectacular planned for Disney’s Animal Kingdom, will debut Feb. 17, Walt Disney World announced Thursday morning.\nCaption Disney sets 'Rivers of Light' debut and replaces 'Wishes' fireworks show “Rivers of Light,” the first nighttime spectacular planned for Disney’s Animal Kingdom, will debut Feb. 17, Walt Disney World announced Thursday morning.\n“Rivers of Light,” the first nighttime spectacular planned for Disney’s Animal Kingdom, will debut Feb. 17, Walt Disney World announced Thursday morning.\nCaption Ticket prices are increasing at Disney theme parks General admission prices are set to increase at Walt Disney World theme parks starting Sunday.\nGeneral admission prices are set to increase at Walt Disney World theme parks starting Sunday.\nCaption Lawsuit alleges injury on Disney's PeopleMover ride Two sisters have sued Disney Parks and Resorts, alleging they sustained injuries on the Magic Kingdom’s Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover.\nTwo sisters have sued Disney Parks and Resorts, alleging they sustained injuries on the Magic Kingdom’s Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover.\nCaption Disney reveals opening dates for Avatar and Star Wars Lands During an earnings call, Disney revealed that the Avatar Land would open May 27 and Star Wars land will open in 2019.\nDuring an earnings call, Disney revealed that the Avatar Land would open May 27 and Star Wars land will open in 2019.\nCaption Get immersed in the arts at new Epcot festival - Theme Park Ranger The Epcot International Festival of the Arts focuses on visual arts, performing arts and culinary arts.
