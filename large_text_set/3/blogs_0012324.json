It's time to get going. The players are on the field. Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara walk out to the centre. News from the Indian dressing room is that VIRAT KOHLI IS PADDED UP. Really good news for the home fans. Steven Smith tosses the ball to Josh Hazlewood, who will kick off proceedings. Pitch report - The cracks have started to open and batting is going to get hard, opines Sunil Gavaskar. Jadeja was effective yesterday after bowling in the rough and Steve O'Keefe too can exploit that area of the pitch. Hello and welcome to the third day of the third Test between India and Australia. The hosts have got what they just would have wanted, a solid start. Though they would be disheartened to lose KL Rahul's wicket, the experienced pair of Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara is at the crease. The home side's aim would be to bat out the whole day as Umesh Yadav pointed out yesterday that each session averages almost 100. Steven Smith's side, on the other hand, will try to make early inroads to put pressure on the hosts. Can India build on the solid platform or will Australia swing the pendulum into their side? Stay with us to find out ...DAY 3, SESSION 1... Australia's bowling was decent on an unresponsive pitch. Pat Cummins was the standout bowler for them, as he bowled his heart out and impressed with his pace and smart variations. Their spinners, however, failed to leave any impact and the visiting team will be hoping that they turn things around tomorrow. India still trail by a big margin and will have to continue batting well to narrow the gap. It promises to be an exciting day 3. Do join us at 0930 local (0400 GMT) for all the action. Cheers! A good session for India! They scored 100 runs for the loss of one wicket and will be pretty pleased with their effort.

But after that, Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara joined forces and didn't allow any more opening to the Aussies. 39.6 OVERS India: 120/1 S O'Keefe to Vijay, Tossed up ball outside off, Murali leans forward and defends it with an angled bat.
