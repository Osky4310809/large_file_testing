The segment opened with vision of newborn babies screaming in hospital cots, and the voiceover: “It’s quite feasible that at least one of these babies will grow up to be homosexual. Even though there’s a strong scientific theory that says none of them has actually been born that way. In fact, at birth, they were all potentially bisexual. But already, after only a couple of days, they’ve begun a so-called learning process that will virtually teach them to be heterosexual. Like any other kind of education, there’ll be some dropouts from the system.”\nID: 10667422 3. Using footage of 100 schoolgirls standing on an oval, Couchman explained how many women were likely to be homosexual.

It’s probably because lesbianism is relatively inconspicuous, that a lot of people find it difficult to believe that it really does exist.\n“This is how the figures work out for 100 girls…\nID: 10668091 5. “Eighty out of the 100 will be entirely heterosexual. The other 20 will probably be involved in some kind of lesbian experience during the course of their lives.

Some 92% of women told HILDA they identified as heterosexual; 1.3% of women identified as bisexual; 0.8% identified as “other”; 0.8% said unsure; and 3.7% said “prefer not to say”.\nIt’s worth noting this is just one study – there is no scientific consensus on how many people are straight, gay or bisexual.\nID: 10667957 TAG YOURSELF I’m entirely heterosexual.
