We're speaking about the whole performance. He gave everything to lead Barcelona to the domestic double. \n\"That also applies for Argentina where he did everything possible to win the Copa America, but he wasn't lucky.\" \nThe former Inter and Valencia coach added that, while Ronaldo's titles may lead him to the award, he was outplayed by his great rivals. \"Ronaldo won titles also, but I don't think his performances were good enough to be the player of the year,\" he said. \n\"Performance won't be in his favour, it's just the titles that would help him to be in the nominations. You can say I chose Messi for several reasons, not just because he's Argentine.\" \nCuper will lead Egypt into the 2017 African Cup of Nations in January, having steered the country back into the prestigious tournament after missing three consecutive editions.
