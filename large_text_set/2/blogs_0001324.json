They were living in Kentucky and their case was investigated out of the Bowling Green FBI office. \nBoth men pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges: Mohanad Shareef Hammadi was sentenced to life in federal prison, and Waad Ramadan Alwan received a 31- to 40-year sentence. \nConway admitted her mistake on Twitter Friday morning, writing that she \"meant to say 'Bowling Green terrorists'\" – but not before Twitter mercilessly mocked her for the error.
