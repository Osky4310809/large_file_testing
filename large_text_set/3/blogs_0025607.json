And when you returned home, you couldn’t stop talking about the people you met and the things you did. \nI get that same kind of feeling every year from my annual trip to spring training camps in Florida and Arizona. \nSo as a way of taking readers along for the ride, here are some of the major things I’m bringing home with me this spring — minus the sunburn and dirty laundry.   \nSpring risers \nThere’s always a danger in putting too much stock in small sample sizes, which is exactly what spring training is. However, the things we see in person tend to stick in our memory banks for easy recall. \nOne thing that was almost impossible to miss is how locked in Bryce Harper seems to be. \nThe day I visited the Washington Nationals’ new spring training home in West Palm Beach, Fla., Harper ripped an RBI double to the opposite field off the Houston Astros’ Mike Fiers in his first at-bat. When Bryce Harper is hitting the ball the opposite way with authority, that's when he's locked in. #Nationals pic.twitter.com/9dHshuVB8i — Steve Gardner (@SteveAGardner) February 28, 2017 \nThe 2015 National League MVP is my pick for the award this season. And while it’s difficult for his stock to rise any more, he looks completely healthy this spring and is leading everyone in home runs. \nOutfielder Andrew Benintendi of the Boston Red Sox had an impressive 34-game stint at the end of last season (.295 batting average/.359 on-base percentage/.476 slugging percentage in 105 at-bats). \n“That definitely boosts my confidence. It’s nice to get off to a hot start and prove to yourself that you deserve to be there,” he told USA TODAY Sports in Fort Myers, Fla. “But here now, I’ve still got a lot to prove.” \nBenintendi seems to have picked up where he left off. Through Sunday, he’s hitting .308 with a pair of homers and eight RBI. \nManager John Farrell likes having a left-handed bat to break up Xander Bogaerts and Mookie Betts, so Benintendi — after hitting at the bottom of the order last season — is getting a look in the No. 3 spot this spring. His fantasy value would get a nice boost if he stays there. \nSince the Oakland Athletics were so bad last season, it was easy to miss the .305 average and .524 slugging percentage third baseman Ryon Healy posted once he was called up after the All-Star break. He took a .125 spring average into the game I saw him, but he launched a long home run off the San Francisco Giants’ Chris Stratton. Wearing McGwire's number, A's DH Ryon Healy connects on a Big Mac special, a long homer to left. #SwinginAs pic.twitter.com/P7TXVo53lt — Steve Gardner (@SteveAGardner) March 3, 2017 \nSince then, the 25-year-old has lifted his average above the .300 mark and taken over the team lead in RBI. With the A’s adding third baseman Trevor Plouffe this offseason, Healy likely will be the regular DH, although he could see some time at first base and potentially gain eligibility there. \nThe Chicago White Sox’s decision to release veteran second baseman Brett Lawrie handed the starting job to 27-year-old utilityman Tyler Saladino. While Saladino has enjoyed an outstanding spring (.389/.450/.750 in 36 at-bats), it seems only a matter of time before the headliner they received in the Chris Sale trade takes over. \nYoan Moncada, 21, is starting to heat up in Cactus League play. Last year’s consensus No. 1 prospect offered a glimpse of his potential recently when he hit two home runs in one game against the Kansas City Royals. His power still might be in its early stages, but he already is a stolen base threat, having swiped 49 and 45 bases in two minor-league seasons. Even if he doesn’t start the season in the majors, Moncada has the talent to be a fantasy factor this season. (Eligible only at third base on draft day, he went for $14 in AL LABR.) \nSpring disappointments \nComing off the worst statistical season of his career (.230, seven HRs), Chicago Cubs outfielder Jason Heyward is attempting to overhaul his swing. \nBy the time I made it to Arizona to check on his progress, Heyward was hitless in his first 15 at-bats. \nBut what does he do the first time I see him? A home run over the right-field wall. Then later in the game, he ripped a two-run double to left. Maybe more impressive than his home run the first time up was Jason Heyward's bases-loaded double the other way against a left-hander. #cubs pic.twitter.com/GsdICCr49A — Steve Gardner (@SteveAGardner) March 6, 2017 \nThat’s the key for Heyward: finding a way to drive the ball more consistently. He had the highest percentage of soft contact of any qualified hitter in the majors last season (27%). Something had to change, but so far, the new swing hasn’t led to any dramatic improvement. \nMinnesota Twins third baseman Miguel Sano hit 25 home runs in 2016, seven more than he did the previous year as a rookie. However, his strikeout and walk rates both got worse and his on-base-plus-slugging percentage dropped from .915 to .781. \nAccording to Fangraphs, Sano’s 65.8% contact rate was one of the worst in the majors in 2016 . And he didn’t look any better when I saw him swing and miss at three consecutive pitches in the dirt in his first at-bat of the spring. \nSano can do serious damage when he connects, but it’s much harder to do if he’s expanding the strike zone like that. \nAnother potential power source, Milwaukee Brewers first baseman Eric Thames is generating a lot of preseason buzz after hitting .321 with 40 homers last season in Korea (and racking up an eye-popping 47 HR, 140 RBI and 40 SB in 2015). The Brewers released last year's NL home run co-champion Chris Carter in the offseason, so Thames is a virtual lock to start there this season. \nBut he has only one home run and one steal in 46 plate appearances so far this spring. The day I saw him, he went 0-fer with a strikeout and a couple easy outs. At age 30, after a couple of so-so MLB seasons in 2011-12, will he be better the second time around? At this point, it seems the $22 he went for in NL LABR was a bit of an overpay. \nOne of last year’s biggest pitching disappointments, Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Shelby Miller, hoped to put his 3-12 record and 6.15 ERA behind him this spring. \nThere were some encouraging signs early in camp, too, when he reportedly hit 99 mph on the radar gun. However, I caught him on a day he was matched up with Oakland’s Sonny Gray, another pitcher looking to rebound from a poor 2016. \nGray allowed five runs to the first five batters — and seven runs total in his two innings. He complained of soreness afterward, which turned out to be a strain in his side. He’s now out until sometime in April. \nMiller yielded six runs in 2 2/3 innings but was upbeat afterward. “Physically I feel good. Stuff-wise I feel good,” he said. “I was just leaving pitches over the middle of the plate.” \nNews you can use \nMiller brings up a good point: Health is more important than performance in spring training, especially with rosters depleted for several weeks because of the World Baseball Classic. \nAs any fantasy owner who bought into outfielder Michael Brantley last season can tell you, injured players tend to stay injured. That’s why Gray has fallen further down my rankings this spring than almost anyone else. \nDavid Wright’s shoulder injury has opened the door for Jose Reyes to play every day and hit leadoff for the Mets. He’s now knocking on the door to the top 200 overall. \nIan Desmond’s broken hand is expected to keep him out a month, possibly longer. His value among outfielders (and once he returns, first basemen) takes a hit, but he should be fine once he has a chance to heal. Downgrade him, but don’t cross him off your draft list. Even a generic replacement in his fantasy roster spot could end up producing 30 homers and 20 steals when added to what Desmond can do going forward. \nAnd after last year, Miller’s and Heyward’s price tags have dropped so low that if they’re healthy, they’re almost guaranteed to turn a profit. \nIn the end, that’s what we’re looking for on draft day — any little bit of information to give us an edge. If there’s some here, then the sunburn was totally worth it. 10 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:33:13.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
