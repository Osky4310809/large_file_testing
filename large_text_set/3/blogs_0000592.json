Adam Schiff, D-Calif., after a briefing with FBI Director James Comey. \n“I appreciate we had a long briefing and testimony from the director today, but in order for us to do our investigation in a thorough and credible way, we’re gonna need the FBI to fully cooperate, to be willing to tell us the length and breadth of any counterintelligence investigations they are conducting,” Schiff said. “At this point, the director was not willing to do that.” Advertisement - story continues below \nSchiff said Comey needs to cooperate “because we’re gonna need that information.” Rep. Schiff: \"It's going to be vital that we get the full cooperation of the FBI.\" pic.twitter.com/AWdxd0qNMi \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) March 2, 2017 \n“And we’re better off getting that through the voluntary cooperation of the FBI than having to contemplate whether we need to subpoena the FBI,” he said.

It doesn’t mean they don’t exist … What I’ve been told by many folks is that there’s nothing there,” Nunes said on Monday. \nFor months, U.S. intelligence agencies have been investigating Russian attempts to interfere in the presidential election. Democrats and some Obama administration officials have advanced the theory there was an inappropriate level of contact between Trump’s campaign and Russia.

And regardless of what side of the aisle you sit on, our country has a vested interest in fully understanding exactly what happened, outside the fog of accusation and political jostling,” Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. said in a statement on Monday. “Any review conducted must have the full confidence of the American people, which is why I recommended an independent review.” What do you think?
