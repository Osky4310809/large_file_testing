Is Kylian Mbappe really 'the new Thierry Henry'? It is too early to tell in either case but what is clear is that the game is currently brimming with exciting youngsters. \nRevealed: Who funded Wenger banners \nBut who are the most promising players on the planet? Well, on Wednesday, Goal will unveil its new series, NxGn , which will unveil the top 50 talents born on or after January 1, 1998. \nWe've asked the judges from across Goal's 37 editions to rate football's most exciting teenagers in terms of first-team experience, potential and overall ability and ranked them by their final tallies. \nDonnarumma is certainly a contender for top spot, having firmly established himself as AC Milan's No.1 since breaking into the first team in October 2015 at just 16 years of age. \nWATCH: Luis Enrique wakes up journalist! \nMbappe, meanwhile, looks set to become the next Monaco academy product to go on to do great things, with the forward already being linked with Europe's elite clubs thanks to his scintillating displays in Ligue 1 and the Champions League this season. \nDortmund trio Christian Pulisic, Alexander Isak and Felix Passlack are also being tipped for the top, while Donnarumma's team-mate Manuel Locatelli produced one of the moments of the Serie A season so far with his winner against Juventus at San Siro. \nThe Bianconeri have their own prodigy, though, with Moise Kean having become the first millennial to play in the Champions League when he came off the bench in the group-stage win at Sevilla on November 22. \nRUMOURS: Barca chase Coutinho \nHistory was also made at Anfield seven days later when Ben Woodburn displaced Michael Owen as Liverpool's youngest ever goalscorer by netting in a League Cup clash with Leeds. And what about Real Madrid-owned prodigy Martin Odegaard, who debuted for Norway at the age of 15? \nDoes Odegaard deserve to be considered the best Under-19 in the game today, though? All will be revealed on Wednesday at 1300CET. The NxGn is coming soon! Don't miss it!
