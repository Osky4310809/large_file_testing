More by John Smallwood Feb 19 \nThis is the time of year when NFL players start complaining about being tagged as a franchise player. \nEstablished in 1993 as a way to help teams hold on to their top unrestricted free agents, the tag allows a team to prevent that player from testing the market by offering a one-year contract for the average salary of the top five highest paid players at that position or 120 percent of his previous year’s salary, whichever is greater. \nI understand why most players don’t like to be tagged as franchise players because it is only a one-year deal and the high chance of injury in football makes longer term financial security more desirable. \nWashington quarterback Kirk Cousins isn’t complaining. In fact, with his coming off a career year in 2016, he is reportedly going to refuse to negotiate a long-term contract until after the team puts a franchise tag on him. \nIt makes sense. \nCousins was a fourth-round draft pick in 2012, which was the same season that Washington mortgaged the farm to move up to the No. 2 spot and draft quarterback Robert Griffin III. \nWith RGIII becoming one of the bigger quarterback busts in recent history, Cousins moved into the starting role and became a Pro Bowl performer in 2016. \nDespite Cousins starting 16 games and leading Washington to the NFC East title in 2015 – the last year of his rookie contract - he could not reach a long-term agreement with the team. \nWashington used the non-exclusive franchise tag on Cousins, meaning a team that signed him as a free agent would have to surrender two first-round draft picks. \nThat effectively killed Cousins' ability to score a big free agent contract but he was guaranteed a one-year, $20 million deal with Washington. \nAfter reaffirming himself as one of the top young quarterbacks in the league, Cousins will now use the tag to his advantage. \nIn all likelihood, Washington wants to sign Cousins long-term – quarterbacks who complete 60 percent of their passes for 4,900+ yards with 25 touchdowns aren’t easy to find. \nCousins probably wants to stay in D.C., but by insisting on first being tagged, he would guarantee that he would be paid $23.9 million for 2017. \nSigning that one-year deal, however, would not prevent Cousins from still negotiating a long-term deal. It would just make sure he has a giant payday if a longer deal could not be reached. \nThat means that for two seasons, Cousins will have banked over $42 million. \nIf you consider that long-term NFL contracts are rarely worth the actual amount of money stated because most only have partial guarantees, you can see how Cousins has found a nice way to game the system. \nAccording to Business Insider magazine, only 23 players in NFL history have earned over $100 million for their career. \nCousins will most likely have almost half that total in the bank within the next nine days – when Washington must use the franchise tag or let him become an unrestricted free agent. \nHeck, if Cousins, 28, was to gamble on himself, he might play this same routine for 2018. If Washington tagged him going into next season, his guaranteed salary would be a 44 percent increase or $33.1 million. \nThe most Tom Brady has made in a single season is $28.8 million. \nCousins might cause players to start viewing the franchise tag in an entirely different light.​ \nFebruary 21, 2017 — 1:06 PM EST Philadelphia Daily News We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
