The show aims to increase the group’s popularity by making the members promote themselves on their own. \nThe members will be given certain missions to complete during each episode, and the show will realistically capture all the adventures members go through. \nWhat’s interesting is that viewers will be able to enjoy two versions of this reality show; one will be publicly broadcasted on TV, while the other one will be available online. Short clips of the show will be revealed every Monday night through Mnet’s digital channel M2, and those clips will be combined for a full one-hour broadcast that will air every Tuesday on Mnet. \nMoreover, APRIL’s official social media account will be updated real time while the members film the show and complete their missions. This way, the members will be able to communicate with fans even more closely as they show their true personalities. \nThe teaser video for their new show “A-IF-RIL” will be released on March 15 at 7 p.m. through M2’s official Facebook page and YouTube channel. \nWhat do you think about the unique format of the show?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:18:36.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
