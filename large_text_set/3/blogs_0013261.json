They only release their big videos a few times a year, but they really go all out with their costumes, makeup, production design, and choreography. Their latest is called Suicide Squad Parody , which is the perfect name for a parody of 2016’s hit movie, Suicide Squad . Not content to make fun of one thing at a time, the girls are also parodying Lady Gaga’s 2011 hit song/video, Judas . Check it out. \nJust to give some perspective, here’s Lady Gaga’s video for Judas . They really nail the look, right? \nHilly and Hannah also nailed their scenes from Suicide Squad . @HillywoodShow IT LOOKS THE SAME AS THE MOVIE OMG pic.twitter.com/I0G81d31Cw", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:14:14.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
