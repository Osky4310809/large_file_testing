Mutch had been booked for less, much less. \n\"Obviously that was a sending off so the referee hasn't done his job. He hasn't been consistent.\" \nOn the defeat itself, Allardyce speculated that losing and being knocked out of the cup could prove to be a blessing in disguise. \n\"Only time will tell whether that defeat is a blessing or not,\" he added. \"Every game you play you want to win it. We've lost that habit of winning. \n\"Our game is okay in parts, we sometimes look quite good and then a mistake creeps in and the opposition punish us.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T03:59:06.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
