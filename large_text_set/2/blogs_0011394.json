As a surprise for the hipsters of Los Angeles, Vanity Fair decided to insert Bolton behind the counter at popular third wave-coffee shop Alfred , and film him singing drink orders for unsuspecting customers. The trendy crowd instantly loves it. One especially stunned young man named Jay tells the camera: “I can’t go to Starbucks now — I’ve got to come here in the hopes that maybe Michael Bolton will return.” Michael Bolton’s Big, Sexy Valentine’s Day Special is a collaboration between the soft rock singer, the Lonely Island guys, and Scott Aukerman of Comedy Bang! Bang! The Lonely Island trio met Bolton while working on the song “Jack Sparrow” ( 161 million YouTube views and counting), and decided to keep in touch. Akiva Schaffer tells Vanity Fair: “When we find ourselves in the same town, we go out for drinks or lunch or something... It’s always a high point of my year.” Can't get enough of Eater?
