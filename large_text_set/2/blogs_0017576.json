Hmmm, go on!\nRelated: Anne Frank Center CONDEMNS Trump's 'Late' Denunciation Of Anti-Semitism! \nReportedly, Drumpf and his lackeys are planning to rescind a policy, put in place by Barack Obama 's camp, which mandates that federally funded schools must treat a student's selected gender identity as his or her sex. Of course Spicey, being the official spin doctor for the White House , danced around what the Trumpster had in store for the policy, but DID acknowledge it was an issue the Departments of Education and Justice are looking into. *eye roll*\nMelissa McCarthy 's muse stated: \n\"I think there will be further guidance coming from DOJ in particular with respect to not just the executive order but also the case that's in front of the Supreme Court .\"\nIn case you forgot, the Supreme Court is slated to hear transgender teen Gavin Grimm 's case on March 28, as he is suing his school so that he may use the boys' restroom.\nWe can't believe THIS is the administration Caitlyn Jenner wanted in office. Spicer continued:\n\"The president has maintained for a long time that this is a states' rights issue and not one for the federal government. So while there will be further guidance coming out, I think that all you have to do is look at what the president's view has been for a long time: that this is not something the federal government should be involved in. This is a states' rights issue.\"\nWay to be on the wrong side of history, AGAIN, you guys! In fact, this statement directly contradicts everything the Obama administration stood for. While there are no federal civil rights protections when it comes to sexual orientation and/or gender identity, Michelle Obama 's husband's administration claimed these students were protected by Title IX — a law which states no student will be discriminated on the basis of sex.\nHowever, after the policy faced a roadblock due to a judge's injunction, the Trump administration decided to not move forward with the appeal filed by his predecessor's team. SRSLY???\nAnd the LGBTQ community is certainly pissed with Donald as Eliza Byard , the Executive Director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network told the Huffington Post :\n\"I find it obscene that Mr. Spicer would characterize the well-being, the health and the very safety of transgender young people as an issue of states' rights. The fact is that no child in America should have their rights subject to their zip code.\"\nHear!
