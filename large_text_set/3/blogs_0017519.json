Sheri L Giblin via Getty Images \nFlorence told Popsugar that when you boil potatoes in water and then drain them, you’re essentially pouring away all of the flavour. \n“So what I do with mashed potatoes - because you finish them with cream and butter anyway, right? - is I’ll take that same cream and butter and add that to the potatoes and cook the potatoes in cream and butter,” he explained. \nFlorence said that he tends to place peeled, chopped potatoes in a mixture of cream (or milk), butter and olive oil in a pan. He also adds garlic, sage, rosemary and a little bit of thyme. \nHe then simmers the concoction on the hob for around 20 minutes until the potatoes are tender. \nNext he puts a bowl on the kitchen worktop with a colander inside and pours the potatoes through the colander, so the cream collects in the bottom. \n“Then I’ll put the potatoes back into the pot and take the potato-infused garlic cream and fold that back into the potatoes, and it’s the most incredible flavour profile,” he added. \nThis is easily as life-changing as when we found out we’d been breaking Toblerone incorrectly. \nNow go forth and make epic mash.
