Thirty-nine international caps for Northern Ireland, a Cup Winners’ Cup medal in the cabinet and a career that took him from Arsenal to QPR to Dallas probably deserves to be remembered for more than a calamitous fall to ruin what is almost certainly the high point of his working life. But as David Baddiel and Frank Skinner were at pains to point out a few years later, Morrow’s ill-fated tumble off the shoulders of his captain, Tony Adams, after the 1993 League Cup final would eclipse everything else, even the winning goal Morrow had scored for Arsenal not half an hour previously.

Photograph: David Giles/PA Archive \nArsenal had fallen behind to a Sheffield Wednesday opener through John Harkes, but a Paul Merson equaliser and Morrow’s strike had even George Graham dancing on the Wembley turf come the final whistle. Everyone knows, or should know, when climbing a ladder the rule of three points of contact, particularly when your ladder is an excitable 6ft 3in centre-back, giddy at the prospect of running up those famous steps. And so, as Adams hoisted Morrow with just a little too much enthusiasm and Arsenal’s match-winner raised a clenched fist into the air towards the celebrating fans, down Morrow went, breaking his arm on the turf, requiring an emergency oxygen mask and ambulance, which would lead to him missing the medal presentation. “Tony, bless him, saw my arm was in a very unnatural position and went to lift it and put it back,” Morrow revealed years later. “The doctor stopped him, thankfully!” \nMorrow would miss the rest of the season, including Arsenal’s FA Cup final win the following month, before which he finally received his League Cup medal. “Tony was devastated,” Morrow admitted. “He was the first at the hospital the next day. But I wasn’t angry, it was a complete accident.” 2) Stuart McCall \nThe year 1999 was a good one. The first season of the Sopranos had just been aired. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater had just been released on PlayStation. Professional footballers were still able to celebrate promotion to the top flight by dancing around Yorkshire car parks with Dean Windass and climbing on top of their affordable cars. Stuart McCall’s calamitous stumble in the car park outside Valley Parade after Bradford’s first promotion to the top flight in 77 years is particularly spectacular if you notice that he manages to not spill a drop of his beer despite headbutting the car’s roof, and if you focus on his thousand-yard stare, just before he disappears from view, almost in slow-motion. 3) Paulo Diogo \nWhat do you remember about Jean Beauséjour? Maybe that he won the League Cup with Birmingham City and the FA Cup with Wigan Athletic . Perhaps you remember him scoring in the World Cup for Chile or his part in the two Copa América triumphs in 2015 and 2016 . You may not recall him once scoring a goal that led to a team-mate losing a finger in the Swiss Super League. \nIt is probably the easiest goal Beauséjour ever scored, the hard work already done by his then Servette team-mate Paulo Diogo, who broke the offside trap, drew the goalkeeper and laid it across to the Chilean to tap in the final goal of a 4-1 win over Schaffhausen, back in 2004. But while Beauséjour wheeled away to the corner flag, Diogo went rogue, leaping over the advertising boards and climbing the metal perimeter fence that separated him and the travelling fans. Except that when the newly-married Diogo descended back to the pitch, his wedding ring, and ring finger remained, caught on the fence. At first Diogo did not seem to notice the blood and bare stump, severed at the first knuckle. Neither did the referee who, unimpressed by Diogo’s celebrations, rubbed salt into the not-so-proverbial wound by issuing the 29-year-old a yellow card for over-exuberance. \nQuickly, though, it became apparent what had happened. Diogo collapsed to the ground, unable to look at his hand. Medical staff were scrambled. Stewards began the search to find the finger, and the ring. Both were eventually retrieved but after being carted off to a Zurich hospital, surgeons were unable to reattach it and Diogo’s stump was amputated. 4) Sergio Ramos \nBy 2011, Real Madrid had gone 18 years without winning the Copa del Rey. Madridistas were hurting: not only had they failed to win this competition in nearly two decades, they had not won any competition since 2008, a relative lifetime for any self-respecting Real fan. To compound supporters’ anxiety going into the 2011 Copa del Rey final against Barcelona, they had not beaten their biggest rivals in nearly three years. They would not beat them again for another eight matches in all competitions, as Barcelona redefined football, winning consecutive La Liga titles and multiple Champions League titles to become arguably the best club side that ever existed. The Joy of Six: goals going in off the woodwork Read more \nSo it is fair to say that those dressed in white had every right to go berserk when Cristiano Ronaldo scored an extra-time winner in that Copa del Rey final to end the drought, and finally get one over their old enemy. Rather than stick about at Mestalla, Madrid’s players flew home that night for an early-hours open-top bus tour through the city, a wild canvas of white shirts painted blue by sirens and red by flares. Front centre of the bus was Sergio Ramos, the club’s vice-captain, his head – then adorned with shoulder-length locks – supporting the 75cm-tall trophy that weighed in at a hefty 15kg. But then he dropped it, and suddenly Real’s new, shiny jewel went under the bus. For a good five seconds it was mangled before someone noticed – a sheepish-looking white-haired member of the emergency services eventually returning what was left of it to the bus, reportedly in 10 different pieces. \nReal’s PR machine went into overdrive. A spokesman insisted it was fine but also being fixed. Within hours a copy was on display at the Bernabéu. Ramos tweeted, tongue firmly wedged in cheek: “What happened with the cup was a misunderstanding, it didn’t fall ... it jumped when we got to Cibeles [the square in Madrid] when it saw so many Madridistas … Hehehehe … everyone, don’t worry, it’s fine ... Hope you have a good day.” For the first time in a long time, they had. 5) Loris Angeli \nThe premature celebration is arguably the best celebration gone wrong. There are many examples in football – Manchester United fans at Sunderland in 2012 , Bayer Leverkusen’s Hans-Jörg Butt getting lobbed on his way back from scoring a penalty in 2004, this guy – and while a sudden-death, penalty-shootout misadventure in the Italian seventh tier might lack the grandeur of the Premier League or the Bundesliga, it certainly had the schadenfreude to make this list. \nThe protagonist here is Loris Angeli, Dro goalkeeper. In a winner-takes-all match to decide promotion, and the score 4-4 in the shootout, Angeli watched on as the Termeno player Michael Palma crashed his spot-kick against the top of the crossbar. As the ball spiralled into the air, Angeli ran towards his bench to celebrate, arms outstretched, ecstatic at Palma’s apparent miss. But despite the ball bouncing outside of the six-yard box, the ball remained live, backspin sending it slowly crawling back towards the goal before settling a yard over the line. With Angeli still completely oblivious, the referee correctly awarded the goal to put Termeno 5-4 up. Dro’s next taker had his penalty saved and, from a seemingly impossible situation, Termeno were promoted, sparking pandemonium in the stands. 6) Robbie Simpson \nPopular on wedding dancefloors and football pitches, the kneeslide really is the people’s celebration. Coventry City fans will take the laughs where they can get them these days, even if it is at the expense of one of their own. Robbie Simpson’s faceplant, so good it almost looks deliberate, was just the ticket in 2009 against Sheffield Wednesday.
