Justin Tallis ID: 10490993 Until now there had been few updates on the progress of the scheme, angering Dubs and pro-refugee campaign groups, which had grown impatient by the lack of action.\nOpposition parties said the government was meeting the letter rather than the spirit of the law.\n“The government has done the bare minimum, helping only a tiny number of youngsters and appearing to end the programme while thousands still suffer,” said Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron. “At the end of December last year the government had failed bring a single child refugee to the UK under the Dubs scheme from Greece or Italy where many of these children are trapped.”\nGoodwill said that in 2016 a total of 900 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children were transferred to the UK from Europe under various schemes including the Dublin regulation, largely as a result of the the clearance of the Jungle refugee camp in Calais.\nThe Dubs amendment, named after the Labour politician, is unrelated to the broader Dublin regulation that also governs some aspects of European asylum cases involving children.\nIn total there were 33,000 asylum claims in the UK last year, including some children travelling with relatives.\nThe minister said the government paid local authorities £41,610 per year for each unaccompanied asylum-seeking child aged under 16 and £33,215 per annum for those aged 16 and 17.\n“By the end of this parliament,” he said, “we will have resettled 20,000 Syrian nationals through our Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme and a further 3,000 of the most vulnerable children and their families from the Middle East and North Africa region under the vulnerable children’s resettlement scheme.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:40:53.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
