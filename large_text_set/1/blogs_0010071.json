We were far superior,\" Luis Enrique told reporters afterwards. \n\"We managed the game well, they scored on their only opportunity but my players knew how to be calm to start again. \n\"The fans responded and supported us when we needed them. \n\"We must now chain the victories to regain confidence in our game.\" \nBelief is unlikely to lie too far away for a side with Messi at their disposal. \nEurope's most expensive squads \nAfter arrowing a free-kick into the top left corner to snatch a point against Villarreal, he whipped home a set-piece from a similar position via the bottom of the right-hand post to spark wild celebrations at Camp Nou. \n\"Leo Messi has been decisive, as usual, and no one has ever been better than him,\" Luis Enrique added. \n\"In all areas of the game, either on a stopped kick or on an action, he feels the game and manages to find the best solution every time. He even makes his team-mates better.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:09:26.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
