South Korea’s version of Saturday Night Live — SNL8 on tvN every Saturday at 9:15 pm — has created a recurring sketch version of Marvel’s Doctor Strange who is far more “boastful YouTube street magician with hype men” than he is “self-serious sorcerer supreme played by Benedict Cumberbatch.”\nThe second of SNL8 ‘s Doctor Strange sketches is available above, expanding on the original sketch ( video below ) in almost every conceivable way. There’s his uncanny ability to make phones ring ( astounding ), opening a single-serve biscuit packet without breaking it ( amazing ), and even a “magically” rising elevator filled with presumably screaming — but silenced — hype men. ( That’s levitation, Holmes! )\nAs /film points out, it has a similar humorous conceit as the viral “David Blaine: Street Magic” sketch from a decade ago. We’ll admit, as much trippy Escher stuff as was in Doctor Strange , we still wouldn’t have objected to Cumberbatch also doing some overly dramatic street magic.\ni know jack shit abt dr strange but i already know that this korean snl parody is better pic.twitter.com/SWe8ZxCA8B \n— Z-01 ʟᴀɴᴄᴇʟᴏᴛ.
