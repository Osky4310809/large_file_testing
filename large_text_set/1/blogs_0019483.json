Product Manager for @HelloWallet by @MorningstarInc. just now An open letter to my conservative friends and family about my attendance at the Women’s March Dear conservative friends and family, Some of you are clearly uncomfortable with my participation at the Women’s March. I’d like to clarify why I attended and what my attendance means about me and my views. I marched to tell President Trump that I will hold him accountable for the prosperity of our nation. I will speak out during his presidency when I disagree with his actions or leadership. I added my voice to the hundreds of thousands who will hold him accountable in four years with our votes. In his inaugural address, President Trump stated that he took “an oath of allegiance to all Americans.” I applaud this sentiment. I marched in solidarity with Americans whose issues and identities he demeaned and insulted during his campaign. I marched to remind him that that he is no longer his own boss. He has signed up for one of the most demanding jobs in the world. He now has millions of bosses who can use their votes to remove him from office in four years. That’s why I marched. But I joined hundreds of thousands of Americans who marched for their own reasons. Reasons with which I may or may not agree. Let me be clear: I hold liberal views about what is best for our country. I would call myself a liberal. But do not confuse me with your worst imagination of who a liberal is or what a liberal does. Let me explain… I do not endorse violent protest. There have been a few isolated instances of violence since Donald Trump’s inauguration. I do not condone them. They were not representative of the Women’s March. I have condemned the violence I have seen in my own city of Washington, DC. These criminals are likely anarchists who would have protested any new president. They do not represent those marching peacefully for progressive government and accountability. I value the rule of law. The legitimacy of a nation depends on its ability to stay true to the laws of its people. It depends on a fair and agreed-upon process to update those laws to reflect the changing needs of its people. A nation should hold those who choose to break the law responsible for their actions. This includes protesters who commit crimes. I believe in the constitutional right to assembly and free speech. You will not find me opposing the rights of conservative groups to assemble and protest, so long as they abide by the law. I participated in this right in my own way by attending the Women’s March. Assembly and free speech are not always the most productive political activities. However, history has proven that at the right time and place, assembly and free speech can change nations. I do not share every view expressed by every other protester at the Women’s March. In fact, I explicitly disagreed with many views expressed at the march. You cannot assume all hundreds of thousands of marchers to be carbon copies of one another. There was a unifying theme of the march, but also a plurality of contrasting views. There are signs that I did not raise, speakers for whom I did not applause, and chants I did not cheer myself. I refrained from expletives and crude language, but often found humor from those who did. Do not assume another’s voice to be my own. Instead, ask me. I am happy to clarify my view. Donald Trump is our president. A minority of marchers expressed that Donald Trump is not our legitimate president. This is not true. Donald Trump won the election fairly. Those who use #notmypresident are free to do so, but you will not find me using that hashtag. I also have great respect for the office of the president. If I were a member of Congress, it would not have been my style to boycott his inauguration. I hope to vote for President Trump in 2020. I hope he is successful in moving our country forward. That said, I disagreed with how he led his campaign. I disagree with his proposed approach for a prosperous America. I hope he will prove me wrong. In the three elections for which I have been eligible to vote, I have voted once for a Republican and twice for a Democrat. Marching in the Women’s March does not make me a party hack. I value empiricism and fact. I will entertain political spin but will not entertain negligent dismissal of fact. I support the constitutional right to a free press. I also hold them accountable to report fact through an empirical lens. I recognize the difference between reporting and the opinions section. I follow conservative news sources to reduce the confirmation bias of my own bubble. I marched to protest how our President has manipulated, distorted, and disregarded facts. My views continue to grow and change. I will change my opinion when presented with empirical evidence to do so. I attempt to practice this skill every day. There is no view that is closed to evaluation, no issue closed to discussion. Evidence suggests that I will become less liberal as I age. I am eager to arrive faster to my own ultimate perspective of truth. Attending the Women’s March gave me an opportunity to observe a plurality of views and contrast them to my own. I appreciate respectful, fact-based dialogue. I enjoy discussing the issue of the day with you. It often widens my perspective and empathy for a more conservative viewpoint. I am fortunate to have friends and family who engage in respectful dialogue. I promise to do my part to ground our discussion in empiricism and fact. Please do not take this letter to suggest that I do not want to have these conversations with you. In fact, I want to have more of them, as they are the antidote for blatant partisanship and polarization. I would be happy to discuss the Women’s March with you. I am a proud American. I firmly believe our country is exceptional. This demands of us a global responsibility to lead by example and to fight for the prosperity of all people. I hold sacred the duty to take part in our own self-governance. I oppose the notion that my involvement in the Women’s March is damaging to our country. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am your friend/cousin/son/nephew. While we can all be defined by our political opinions, my political opinions do not define my relationship with you. Our relationship is defined by car trips, tree forts, and kickball games. It is defined by family reunions, marching band performances, and soccer practices. It is defined by Boy Scout camping trips, bowling nights, and weddings. You have made me who I am today. I am proud of who I have become, but humbled by all that I do not presume to understand. I am interested in your life: the new baby, the medical issues, your recent travels, and the family gossip. I am grateful for those of you who have expressed an interest in my own life and my wife’s life despite our contrary political beliefs. So conservative friends and family, I hope this letter clarifies why I attended the Women’s March. I hope it dispels any misconceptions you may have had about my views. The media is not always incentivized to perfectly represent political views and actions. It is unlikely they perfectly represent mine. The only way for you to know is to ask me. I’ll try to do the same for you :-) Love, David P.s. No, I did not set fire to that limo. That was some criminal anarchist a**hole.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:23:03.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
