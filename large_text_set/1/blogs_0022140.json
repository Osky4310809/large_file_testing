An Australian kindergarten has banned birthday cake because it has too much sugar (file image) The kindergarten sent an email explaining 85 per cent of parents supported the ban (pictured) 'Why can't we just let kids live?' she wrote. The mother explained if every child brought in cake for their class mates to celebrate their birthday it would amount to just 'one cupcake per fortnight'. 'Obviously a number might have sugar issues but 85% against?' she wrote. The letter from the school explained the 'team' in charge of kindergarten will 'develop exciting new initiatives to celebrate birthdays'. 'Your children will still celebrate this special milestone with their friends at kindy.' Other mothers commenting on the post appeared to be shocked, saddened and angered by the news.
