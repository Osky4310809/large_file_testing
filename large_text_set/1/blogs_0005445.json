The video above isn't the first time they've used Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez in some sort of wacky challenge. \nOnly last month the Barcelona duo were trying to kick down a manually piloted drone with footballs. It's great, honestly - watch it here . \nNow the two deadliest attackers in world football are taking on a challenge on a much grander scale - long distance keepy-uppies. Luis Suarez shows a decent touch (Photo: Yu -chan / Youtube) \nStarting at 10m the pair must keepy-uppy pass it to each other without the ball hitting the ground. \nAfter each successful pass, Messi must move back another 10m. The aim is to see how far the pair can get until the ball touches the ground. Lionel Messi dispatches a pass (Photo: Yu -chan / Youtube) \nSlowly but surely the pair make it to an incredible 56m! To put that in perspective, that's over the halfway line if you're kicking from the goal. \nEventually, Messi is the one who loses it for the pair after sending his volley desperately wide. But it's still a valiant effort by the Barcelona duo. Incredible skill.
