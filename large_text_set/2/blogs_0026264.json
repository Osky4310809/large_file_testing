Real big.\nLenovo Yoga 720 Convertible laptops have by-and-large settled into the 10-to-13-inch range, with a few 14-inchers scattered about. Much larger than that and it becomes awkward to use as a tablet. But don't tell that to Lenovo and their new Yoga 720. Coming in 13-inch and 15.6-inch sizes, the updated convertibles pack the latest chipsets and all of the little features we've come to love and expect.\nWe're talking a processor specced up to an 7th-gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i7, up to 16GB of RAM, and varying SSD and HDD storage options depending on the model. They're also packing Windows Hello-compatible fingerprint readers (no IR facial recognition cameras, though) and a USB-C + Thunderbolt 3 port. The nicest bit is in the 15-inch version: an NVIDIA GTX 1050 GPU â€” the best graphics card you'll find in a convertible laptop. Gaming on a convertible? Now you can. If the 13-inch Yoga 720 is more your style, then you'll have to settle for the still-decent Intel HD Graphics 620 GPU.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:01:41.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
