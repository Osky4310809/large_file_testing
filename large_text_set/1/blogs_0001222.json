Activists say that the threat of being accused of blasphemy has created a climate of fear, where anyone can be targeted and the law can’t be discussed.\n“I’m now in a position something like Salman Rushdie,” said Mr. Taseer, referring to the novelist who has had to live in hiding since a 1989 edict condemned him to death. “They have called for my assassination.”\nHis father, Salmaan Taseer, then governor of Punjab province, was shot dead in 2011 by his own bodyguard, Mumtaz Qadri, after he criticized Pakistan’s blasphemy laws. Mr. Qadri was executed last year after a Supreme Court verdict, but his funeral was attended by huge crowds , and his followers are building an ornate shrine just outside Islamabad over his grave.\nAccording to the fatwa, issued by a group called Tehreek Labaik Ya Rasool Allah, the younger Mr. Taseer has “crossed all limits of insulting God and the prophet” and is now “condemnable to death”. The group, which is legal, is from the Barelvi sect, the biggest Muslim denomination in the country, which is normally considered moderate but on the issue of blasphemy, it is the most hardline.\n“In no unclear terms, they’ve told their supporters to prepare another Mumtaz Qadri,” said Mr. Taseer, adding that he had received hundreds of messages of hate and death threats since he was accused.\nPolice in Lahore also registered a case against Mr. Taseer under the blasphemy law. The case is under a section of the law meant for hate speech.\nAccording to the charge, dated Dec. 30, police found a recording on a memory stick left outside a police station in which a person “ridiculed a religious law, which may cause provocation.”\nNasir Hameed, the police officer in charge of the Islampura police station in Lahore where the case is registered, said officers were investigating further. The case doesn’t name Shaan Taseer, but he identifies himself by name in the recording.\n“Having a fatwa and a blasphemy case against you is putting a target on your back,” said Jibran Nasir, a lawyer and activist. “These fanatics can motivate people to get you anywhere.”\nMr. Taseer, aged 45, is currently outside Pakistan and asked for his location not to be revealed. Activists fear that the fatwa still puts him in danger abroad and also prevents his ability to return.\nIn Pakistan, crowds often surround police stations to pressure police into registering blasphemy cases, in which both Muslims and non-Muslims are targeted. Activists say that the evidence is usually flimsy and the blasphemy law is regularly used to settle personal scores. Allegations of blasphemy have repeatedly in the past motivated mobs to kill the accused.\nSeparately, the same religious group threatened on Dec. 31 to issue a fatwa against leading opposition politician Imran Khan, unless he apologizes for a supposed insult to the Prophet Mohammad in a speech. There was no immediate response from Mr. Khan’s spokesperson.\n–Qasim Nauman contributed to this article.\nFor breaking news, features and analysis from India, follow WSJ India on Facebook .\nShare this: Blasphemy Law Pakistan Salmaan Taseer Shaan Taseer Previous 5 Things That Will Impact Indian Shares in 2017", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/wsjindia"], "published": "2017-01-03T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T16:23:24.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
