Now it appears that Micromax is also planning to launch a similar device. According to The Economic Times , Micromax is betting on a budget feature phone that supports 4G and VoLTE (voice over LTE) to revive its market share after getting pushed to the bottom by aggressive Chinese manufacturers. \nAs per the report, Micromax is working on a feature phone called the Bharat One, which will offer 4G and VoLTE connectivity, and will be priced below Rs 2,500. The brand is also planning to launch another device called the Bharat Two, which will be a budget VoLTE-enabled smartphone that will be priced below Rs 3,300. \nIt’s worth mentioning that Reliance Jio has been planning to launch entry-level 4G-enabled feature phones priced between Rs 999 and Rs 1,500 this month or next. If ET’s report is true, Micromax’s feature phone will sit between Reliance Jio’s upcoming offerings and the Lava 4G Connect M1. Micromax’s offering is also expected to come bundled with digital payments feature. \n“While the VoLTE feature phone could lead to operator tie-ups to push the category and acceptance, the smartphone may have a back-end tie-up with Transerv and MVisa that could enable digital payments,” adds the report. \nThe touch-and-type device will be aimed at users who do not want to move from feature phones but are looking to access basic internet services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T13:47:38.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
