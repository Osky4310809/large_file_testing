The confrontation escalated and Houser shot Nieves. Nieves’ sister, Angelica, has said her brother was moving furniture with his girlfriend at the time. \nPolice have said Nieves did not have a weapon. Houser was stripped of his police powers a day after the shooting. Jose Nieves (Credit: Facebook) \nNieves’ family has filed a federal lawsuit against the city and Houser. The lawsuit does not offer details of the fatal shooting, but alleges “Houser illegally detained and threatened to arrest and physically harm” Nieves on the morning of the shooting. \n“Without cause or provocation, Defendant Officer Lowell Houser shot Jose Angel Felipe Nieves to death,” the lawsuit alleges. \nThe lawsuit also alleges the Chicago Police Department was warned Houser “had illegally detained and threatened to arrest and physically harm” Nieves on one or more occasion before the shooting. \n“The family is seeking fundamental and transformative change within the Chicago Police Department. Their son, their brother was killed for no reason by a man who was operating with his police powers.” \nAngelica Nieves said Houser had pulled a gun on her brother in the past. \nA Chicago police department spokesperson told CBS 2 that police were called to Jose Nieves’ home on Dec. 11 for an alleged assault he was committing. At the time, Nieves told police that a man who identified himself as a Chicago police officer pointed a gun at him. Internal Affairs was trying to determine if that officer was the same one who fatally shot Nieves. A department spokesperson could not say if Nieves had been charged with a crime after that December police call. \nNieves’ family members also believe the confrontation might have had something to do with one of the officer’s family members, but police said they could not confirm that. \nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, Houser has been the focus of 20 disciplinary investigations since the 1990s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:45:18.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
