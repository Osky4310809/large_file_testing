Oxbridge cut Jones’ lead to 57-54 with 22 seconds left on a three by Nashani Gilbert-Taylor.\nThe Tigers missed four straight free throws from there and Oxbridge drove for a layup on a fast break just before time expired.\nJones trailed 37-21 early in the third quarter and 47-33 entering the fourth before going on to outscore Oxbridge 14-0 over the final eight minutes to force overtime.\nCaption Talking state soccer, girls basketball playoffs, wrestling and softball An update on winter sports tournament time and spring sports.\nAn update on winter sports tournament time and spring sports.\nCaption Talking state soccer, girls basketball playoffs, wrestling and softball An update on winter sports tournament time and spring sports.\nAn update on winter sports tournament time and spring sports.\nCaption Public defender arrested for DUI An Orange County public defender pulled over for a DUI last week asked the trooper not to take him to jail because he was a good person, video shows.\nAn Orange County public defender pulled over for a DUI last week asked the trooper not to take him to jail because he was a good person, video shows.\nCaption Varsity basketball and soccer playoffs for the week of 02-06-2017 Rankings of varsity basketball and soccer playoffs for the week of 02-06-2017\nRankings of varsity basketball and soccer playoffs for the week of 02-06-2017\nCaption Tiebreakers factor in boys basketball district seeding Top seeds for boys basketball district tournament\nTop seeds for boys basketball district tournament\nCaption Nine Dr. Phillips High School athletes honored on National Signing Day Nine student athletes signed their letters of intent at a ceremony at Dr. Phillips High School Wednesday.\nNine student athletes signed their letters of intent at a ceremony at Dr. Phillips High School Wednesday.\njcarnahan@orlandosentinel.com\n Varsity Basketball", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-589919d5/turbine/os-varsity-basketball-and-soccer-playoffs-for-the-week-of-01-06-2017", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58993009/turbine/os-public-defender-arrested-for-dui", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58890500/turbine/os-tiebreakers-factor-in-boys-basketball-district-seeding", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ae1f00/turbine/os-sp-hs-jones-0222", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58a25027/turbine/os-state-playoffs-for-the-week-of-02-13-2017", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58924b2b/turbine/os-nine-dr-phillip-high-school-athletes-honored-on-national-signing-day-20170201"], "published": "2017-02-23T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:30:21.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
