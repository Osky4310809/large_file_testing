Back away from the tweets, for your own good. \nBaldwin speaks from experience, having quit Twitter in 2013 before returning with a much more subdued style of tweeting. It's a difficult medium filled with trolls and criticism. \nAlec Baldwin as President Trump on 'Saturday Night Live.'

And I tried to do that. Therefore when people picked a fight with me, whether they were mean to me or they spit on me in the digital world, I got angry. And I would get into these rants with people. And I stopped and said to myself, ‘What the hell am I doing?’ And you let it go.\" \n\"No matter what you do, you’re never going to be able to control the opinions of all of these people,\" says Baldwin, who lampoons the president on Saturday Night Live and has sparred with Trump on Twitter. \"They hate, because that is what they need to do, my political opposites.\" \nAlec Baldwin can smile about Twitter again, after quitting in 2013.
