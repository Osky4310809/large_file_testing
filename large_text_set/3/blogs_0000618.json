Jio’s Happy New Year offer forced the other operators to launch several promotional offers to compete against the newcomer. If that wasn’t enough, Jio recently dropped another bomb by launching its Prime membership package . Jio’s latest offer is quite attractive, and has again forced rival operators to launch new offers to stay relevant in the highly competitive Indian telecom sector. \nAirtel, Vodafone and Idea, all three operators have launched their latest promotional offers to compete against Jio’s Prime membership plans. To find out how the new prepaid plans stack against each other in terms of the benefits, let’s compare the latest offers. Airtel \nIndia’s leading telecom operator with over 260 million subscribers has launched a promotional plan priced at Rs 345 (Rs 348 in some circles). The new pack offers 1GB of data and unlimited free calls to any network for 28 days. You get 1GB of data every day, but you can only use 0.5GB of data during the day and the remaining 0.5GB at night between 12 am and 6 am . Vodafone \nTalking about Vodafone, the company recently launched a new Rs 346 tariff plan. This plan gives you 1GB of data every day and unlimited free calls for 28 days. Also, on first recharge, Vodafone users will get double data (56GB) and unlimited free calls along with double validity of 56 days. The brand said that it runs various offers, and this is just one of those, only valid till March 15th. Idea Cellular \nAs for Idea, the company’s new plan is priced at Rs 348, and has a validity of 28 days. It comes with perks like unlimited voice calls to any network and 500MB of 4G data every day. Unfortunately, this plan is not available to every user as the brand is offering it the subscribers who don’t consume much data. Reliance Jio Prime Membership plans \nJio users can enrol for its Prime membership till March 31st for a nominal fee of Rs 99. Then they can choose the Rs 303 monthly plan, which offers 1GB of data every day and unlimited free calls to any network alongside access to Jio’s premium apps suite for 28 days. If this isn’t enough, if you recharge before March ends, you get 5GB of extra data in April. Conclusion \nAs you can see from the comparison, Reliance Jio’s Prime plans appear to be offering the best value at the moment. While Airtel, Vodafone and Idea are running limited-period promotional offers, Jio’s Prime membership plans ensure a year of unlimited free calls and 1GB of data every day at just Rs 10/day till March 31st, 2018.
