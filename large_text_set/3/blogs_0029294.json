Perez has only started two Premier League games for the Gunners (Photo: Getty) \nPerez joined the north London club from Deportivo La Coruna last summer for £17.1million, but has failed to make any impact and has only started two Premier League games. \nBut the Spanish forward is adamant he is still happy at Arsenal and feels Wenger is the best man to carry the club forward. \nPerez, speaking on Radio Marca, said: \"Although I'm not a starter, I have a very good relationship with Wenger. He is an icon and I think he is going to continue Perez expects Wenger to sign a new deal (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"People respect him. His relationship with the players is very good and he has been here 20 years. \n\"I would like him to continue but that's his decision. He has not communicated his decision to the team or the club yet.\" \nDespite his lack of first-team starts, Perez has still managed an impressive record in front of goal scoring seven goals and registering five assists during his 21 appearances for the club.

The coach can only choose 11 and the only thing I can do is make the most of the chances I'm given. \n\"Whenever I've played, I've done well and that gives me confidence. I have to be patient and continue to fight.
