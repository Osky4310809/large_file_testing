As an explanation for the new (old) policy, he tweeted this statement about the new (old) direction of the brand:\npic.twitter.com/sL1nSF6fYC\n— Cooper Hefner (@cooperhefner) February 13, 2017\nHe sites that \"nudity was never the problem\" and by re-instilling nudity back into the magazine, Playboy is taking back their identity and reclaiming the cultural icon they once were.\nHowever, in reality, Playboy isn't really changing its policy in a drastic manner. Under the ban, models were technically still nude, but had their hands placed strategically over areas that had previously been freely displayed. Now, the new issue will feature butts and breasts, but no full frontal nudity that was allowed before the no nude ban.\nThe decision to eliminate nudity in the magazine was originally a plot to make it easier to sell more magazines in stores, but subscription sales plummeted as a result.\nBasically, the nude ban and the reinstatement of nudity are just statements of technicalities. By trying to rebrand the magazine, Playboy has revealed more than naked woman: it might not know where it belongs.\n[H/T: Jezebel]\nBONUS: 100 years of bunny beauty: Playboy’s got nothing on these heart-thumps", "external_links": ["http://jezebel.com/forget-what-they-told-you-playboy-now-says-naked-is-no-1792309555", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NakedIsNormal?src=hash", "https://t.co/sL1nSF6fYC", "https://twitter.com/cooperhefner/status/831169811723939842", "https://t.co/FhCkcmnV0S", "https://t.co/WSxMElDa94", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/ghgdf3RM.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/Playboy/status/831155991064506368", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/ghgdf3RM.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-14T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:26:25.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
