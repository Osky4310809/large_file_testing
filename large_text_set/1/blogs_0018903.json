It was clear to me that America is getting more polarized than ever. We too rarely hear from moderates, in the media or even in social conversation. I call them The Silenced Majority. \nAlas, many moderates, including me, feel we cannot state our views, which on some issues can be liberal, conservative or moderate, without getting our heads chopped off. This is not an a priori fear . For example, Increasingly, when I do speak up, the response is often non-responsive or an ad hominem attack, even name-calling. \nFor example, today, I ran into a neighbor while walking my dog. I asked how he felt about the inauguration. He said, “Angry. In grief .” Because he’s normally an easy-going guy with whom I’ve had a number of pleasant conversations at block parties and such, I told him that I was agnostic on Trump. I said, \nYes, Trump strikes me as both pre-senile and hubristic. Also I’m concerned that despite his protestations, Trump cares too much about the wealthy. Also, I'm very pro-choice and I’m afraid his Supreme Court picks won’t be. \nHe nodded. But because Trumps downsides are so well publicized, I then talked more about a Trump administration's possible upsides. \nOn the other hand, we’ve had 40 years of domestic policy based on identity politics and redistribution to women and minorities. Yet despite a $22 trillion taxpayer spend , the achievement gap is as wide as ever and race and gender relations are more polarized than ever. Internationally, we’ve had a foreign policy that literally and figuratively have drawn empty lines in the sand, which has made the U.S. perceived as a paper tiger. \nSo yes, I hold many liberal views: pro-choice, gay marriage , anti- materialism , pro-right-to-die, see myself as a world citizen more than an American, and favor not discrimination nor reverse discrimination but equal opportunity. \nBut I also holds some conservative views: For example, I think government is a poor steward of our tax dollars. As a Ph.D. in the evaluation of innovation , I’ve grown pessimistic about the power of education and social programs to be worthy of yet more tax dollars. The failure of Head Start is a notable example. And I know that the statistic that women earn 79 cents on the dollar for the same work is a canard. \nSo, I cannot, with broadbrush, hate Trump or, as a recent article in The Nation urged, that we all mobilize to throw sand into every Trump initiative. Rather, while I'm agnostic about it, it's possible that Trump’s core principles around meritocracy and a strong military may not be so bad. \nHe called me a racist and sexist and walked away. \nIn recent weeks, I have tried to avoid political conversations, let alone those about race and gender, because we are so polarized. Just as it’s foolish to try to reason with someone when furious, it seems foolish to try to advocate moderation and reflectiveness in our very overheated environment . I’m outspoken by nature and I feel there's duct tape around my mouth now, and the shyer moderates I've spoken with truly have felt silenced. So it seems that society’s mind-molders: the schools, colleges, and media--have indeed created a Silenced Majority. \nRegular readers of my work know that, when I describe a problem, I almost always propose one or more possible solutions. I’m more cautious here. Merely encouraging extremists to be more tolerant somehow feels like fighting a tidal wave with a thimble. Until society’s mind-molders---the schools, colleges, and media—replace their new role as agitators-in-chief with their time-honored appropriate role as presenter of the full-range of responsibly held ideas, I believe we’re headed to Civil War II with the Silenced Majority too cowed to be the peaceable voice of moderation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T03:23:14.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
