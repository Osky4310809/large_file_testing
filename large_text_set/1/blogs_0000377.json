Michael van Gerwen said it felt great to beat the two players he lost to in the last two years, Gary Anderson and Raymond van Barneveld, to win the title \nThe Dutchman reeled off the opening set in a blur of green, pinning the bullseye for a 122 finish in the very first leg, and would open an early lead with a composed 36 checkout. \nBut Anderson had expertly held his nerve in the previous two finals and applied the brakes to 'The Green Machine' by finding double 20 to level the match. \nThe first break would come in the following set, with Anderson hitting tops again with arrow-like accuracy, and he pinched the third set on double 12 after more stray darts from Van Gerwen.
