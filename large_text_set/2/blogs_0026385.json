At least my daughter was never left alone.” \nAnd in her cruel outburst she added: “Don’t get me onto the McCanns, we’ve all got something to say about them. \n“We’re too lower class for them but we can still have an opinion. There seems to be one rule for them and another for us but she was a dreadful mum.

My Shannon was kept away from her family but she was never left alone.” \nMadeleine, three, disappeared from the family’s holiday apartment in Praia de Luz, Portugal, in May 2007. \nThe following February, Shannon vanished from her mum’s home in Dewsbury, West Yorks.

Karen Matthews was jailed for kidnapping her own daughter \n“Karen was guilty and put her hands up but she wasn’t the brains behind the plot to kidnap her daughter. \n“I’m not excusing her in any way but I and the rest of the neighbourhood want to know the real reason for what happened. We want answers.” \nMatthews, served just four years of her sentence, and was freed in April 2012. She is now living at a secret location in the south of England.
