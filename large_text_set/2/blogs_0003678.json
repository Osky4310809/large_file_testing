AU also is concerned that vouchers will be used at private religious schools that teach religion, such as creationism and anti-LGBTQ curriculum. AU notes that these school don’t provide the same civil rights protections — including those that protect students with disabilities and young women against discrimination — that public schools do. \nVoters have shown their lack of confidence in voucher programs by voting them down in ballot referenda across the country, including in DeVos’ home state of Michigan. And the nature of her confirmation — requiring Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote for the first time in our nation’s history for a cabinet appointee — should send a clear signal that she lacks public support. \n“We’re disappointed that more senators didn’t listen to their constituents who have protested DeVos’ nomination for weeks,” [Executive Director Rev. Barry W.] Lynn said. “We hope the American people will join us in continuing to loudly voice support for public education and opposition to misguided voucher schemes.” \nDeVos has long believed her job as an education “reformer” is to “advance God’s Kingdom.” \nGod’s not going to help her, but she’ll finally be in a position where she can dismantle the public education system from the inside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T20:19:06.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
