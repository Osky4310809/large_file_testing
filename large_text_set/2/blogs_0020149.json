To give you some tips on who to choose, our Fantasy Football scout share his selection based on the players current form, shooting accuracy and goal scoring record. These are the strikers on this week’s shortlist Gareth Bale \nThe Welshman was in fine form on his return from injury and scored the goal that clinched victory for Real over Espanyol. Bale scored the last time Madrid played away to Valencia and he looked sharp enough at the weekend to suggest he can find the net again. He has scored 5 goals in 11 appearances and has a shooting accuracy of 49%. Raheem Sterling \nSterling has only scored 1 goal in 5 appearances in the Champions League this season, but his recent performances have been encouraging. City host Monaco in this first leg tie and this is the type of game Sterling enjoys playing in. He has a shooting accuracy of 40% and there are odds of 15/8 for him to score in 90 minutes. Chicarito \nThe Mexican striker has scored 3 goals in his last 5 games for Leverkusen, who will host Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. Chicarito only has 1 goal in 6 appearances this season but he has an impressive shooting accuracy of 80%. The odds on him scoring are 9/4. Zlatan Ibrahimovic \nThe United talisman has scored twice in his last 5 games and he currently has a 75% shooting accuracy. With United holding a comfortable 3-goal lead over St. Etienne, he may not start the second leg in France. But if United struggle, they may need to bring him on. The odds on Zlatan scoring in this tie are 6/5. Edin Dzeko \nThe Bosnian has to be on this shortlist, he has scored in his last 5 games and scored 3 in Roma’s away leg victory against Villareal in the Europa League. He has a shooting accuracy of 62% and has scored 8 goals in only 6 appearances. Gonzalo Higuain \nHiguain is another Serie A striker in excellent form, having scored 4 goals in his last 5 games. He has 3 goals in 5 appearances in the Champions League and he will look to add to that record when Juventus travel to Porto on Wednesday. Higuain has a shooting accuracy of 54% and there are odds of 11/8 for him to score. Cristiano Ronaldo \nReal Madrid will travel to Valencia on Wednesday night in an important game in the Primera Division. CR7 scored twice in the reverse fixture in September and now has a total of 14 goals in 16 league appearances. He has a shooting accuracy of 51%. \nDo you agree with these selections?
