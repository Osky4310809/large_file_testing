James Daichendt's new book Kenny Scharf: In Absence of Myth . This particular chapter, entitled \"Art in the Streets,\" covers the SoCal native's relationship to the street art world. \nStreet art has become the largest art movement of the 21st century. Developed from graffiti, the post-museum art form was first established in New York in the 1970s, when [Kenny] Scharf and his colleagues borrowed aspects of graffiti and successfully took the art form beyond letter writing. This spawned artists like Shepard Fairey, Barry McGee and Banksy, who carried the torch for street art in subsequent decades. \nStreet art again experienced a significant jump forward in the 2000s as social media became a way to spread these accessible and riveting images instantaneously. Dubbed the “art of the people,” it’s acknowledged as art the second it is stumbled upon, reversing many of the attributes conceptualists left the art world. This surge of activity began as Kenny found his legs in Los Angeles, a combination of events that culminated in Kenny painting murals and using the streets as prominent aspects of his work again. \nIn 2004, after years of not painting outside, Kenny was asked to paint something at the Pasadena Museum of California Art in conjunction with the exhibit \"Kenny Scharf: California Grown.\" Kenny’s idea was to paint the garage, which was inspired by Barry McGee’s garage installation at LACMA, and he knew it would last longer than the show itself. This was followed by an invitation from longtime supporter Jeffrey Deitch, who began curating the Wynwood Walls a few years later in Miami. The momentum continued to build through the years with an invitation to paint the infamous Bowery Wall in New York City in 2010 and a host of projects across the country in 2011.

This invitation marks his latest wave of success, as street artists are quick to acknowledge his contributions to their history. A host of publications, exhibitions, and documentaries also followed these events, which expanded the knowledge base and fandom for the work of street artists around the world. The new West Hollywood Library was scheduled to open in October of 2011, and the parking garage was a collaboration with the city of West Hollywood and the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA). The commissioned murals were considered to be an extension of the wildly popular exhibition Art in the Streets, the first major U.S. museum survey of graffiti and street art at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Along with Shepard Fairey and Retna, Kenny was asked to paint on this monstrous surface. Spray painting had always had a big impact in Kenny’s art, and while he never called himself a graffiti artist, he was clearly being written into its history. \nSoon after the mural was completed, Kenny received a call from The Simpsons television show. Shepard Fairey was to play a lead character and the show hoped to include Kenny, Ron English, and Robbie Conal to round out a group of historically important street artists. On the episode called “Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart,” Kenny’s character is busy spray-painting his characters in an alley. One of the antagonists on the show teases Kenny’s character as he works on the wall by asking if he was designing a Mommy and Me store. After which Kenny mocks him and adds his face to the mural. The episode aired in 2012, and being included on a Simpson ’s episode is a bit like being knighted in pop culture.

A list was published of The Simpsons creator, Matt Groening’s 100 favorite things, and art by Kenny Scharf was listed as number 85. This very cool development exemplified how Kenny’s influence was being recognized by creatives and artists across the communities that he had been shaped by as a kid and now impacted by as an adult. The support and appreciation that Kenny desired over the years was returning and on a much larger scale, acknowledgment that the artist could not have been more grateful for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:29:01.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
