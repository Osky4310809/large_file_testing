Credit Jessica Hill for The New York Times \nHow does money, work or social class fit into your life, and did you write about it in the college application essay that you submitted this school year? \nFor the fifth year, Ron Lieber, the New York Times’s Your Money columnist, is asking high school seniors and people applying to college during their gap years to send in undergraduate application essays on these topics. To get an idea of the kinds of things we like to publish, here are some essays we’ve featured in The Times: 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 . \nNo topic is too weighty and no stunt too flighty or approach too light for our taste, as long as the essay has at least something to do with money. In the past people have written about their own jobs or their parents’ work (or lack thereof), what it’s like to be poor, what it’s like to be rich and what it’s like to work at McDonald’s. One essay threw shade on the waste and expense of the college admissions process, while another described fellow high school students and their specialization in marijuana, Adderall and test answers. \nWe’ll pick a few of the best entries to run in early May and pay the writers our normal freelance rate. \nPlease use the form below to send your essays to us by Friday, April 21. \nA new twist this year: Anyone who wants to send in a bit of multimedia to go with the essay is welcome to do so. Videos, Instagram or Snapchat stories or anything else is welcome. If you are submitting a story from either Instagram or Snapchat, please download it and send it as a video file. \nNot doing this won’t hurt your chances, but we’re open to the possibility that something in addition to words on a page might bring your relationship with money to life.
