Tonight, he beat the Warriors with a pair of ballsy threes. He’s the King of Miami now , those are the rules. Advertisement \nThe first one was this step-back shot to give the Heat a five-point lead deep in the fourth quarter. It’s typical Waiters fare—low-percentage, high-difficulty—only he made it. \nWaiters ended up with 33 points on 20 shots, the most important of which was the game-winner. \nLook forward to Waiters shooting 13 threes per game now because he thinks he’s a superstar.
