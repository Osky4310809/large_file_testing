Ukrainian Forces Blow Up Power Tower Near Donbass City of Horlivka - DPR The situation in southeastern Ukraine has escalated over the past few days, in particular near the town of Avdiivka in the Donetsk region, where clashes between Kiev forces and the militia of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) have intensified.

Kiev has since been conducting a military operation, encountering stiff local resistance.\nIn February 2015, Kiev forces and Donbass independence supporters signed a peace agreement in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.
