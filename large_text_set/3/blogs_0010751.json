The project is being produced in conjunction with Sofia Vergara’s talent management and entertainment marketing firm, Latin World Entertainment . \n“Manolo finally graduated, and I am very happy for his alliance with Fusion to create such an innovative series,” Sofia Vergara said in a statement. She’s best known for her turn on ABC’s “Modern Family.” \nFusion, a joint venture of ABC News and Univision Communications , aims to reach a millennial audience — and sees Snapchat as a key content-distribution partner. Fusion was among media companies that launched on the Snapchat Discover service in January . The Discover service lets partners post video and content “stories” that are available for 24 hours; ordinarily, messages posted between Snapchat users vanish after 10 seconds or less.
