Blanchard recently had multiple sclerosis diagnosed. (Photo courtesy of Julie Persell) The first warning sign came last April, when Kara Blanchard ’s feet became so numb her flip-flops would slide off. The sensation subsided, but then in early December her vision became so blurry she could hardly catch a basketball and she began experiencing excruciating headaches.\nOn Dec. 12, at the suggestion of an ophthalmologist, the Chesapeake senior and her parents went to Johns Hopkins to determine the cause of her symptoms. A brain MRI brought a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.\n“When they first told me those two words, I started crying. I started hyperventilating,” Blanchard, 18, said. “I thought I would be wheelchair bound.”\nThe tears dried, and Blanchard returned to Pasadena for basketball practice later that day. The senior guard wasn’t allowed to participate since she had missed much the majority of the school day for her appointment, but she didn’t want to be alone.\nIt was a week before Blanchard finally told her teammates she has an autoimmune disorder that attacks the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. But once her fellow Cougars found out, the support flooded in. With her school community behind her, Blanchard has felt empowered to become an ambassador for high school athletes with the disease.\nHer influence has started to seep into the local basketball community, and it’ll be on full display Tuesday when the Cougars host MS Awareness Night during their game against Glen Burnie .\n“My daughter tries to transcend playing sports,” said Joe Blanchard, Kara’s father and the Cougars’ junior varsity girls’ coach. “She always goes out of her way to lift other people up.”\nThat’s a sentiment echoed by those around Blanchard. Chesapeake varsity Coach Maria Gray said Blanchard could be the fastest one running sprints at practice, but if one teammate is lagging behind, Blanchard will slow and offer a helping hand. So it’s little surprise that Blanchard’s story is gaining attention.\nChesapeake printed orange T-shirts — the color associated with MS awareness — that read ‘Cougars for Kara’ on the back and ‘Help Cure Multiple Sclerosis’ inside a ribbon on the front. The front is also dotted with Cougars claws, but that didn’t stop rival Northeast from sporting the shirts before its 67-32 loss to Chesapeake on Friday.\n“Northeast and Chesapeake are big rivals,” Joe Blanchard said. “To have them wear Chesapeake T-shirts, it was an amazing show of solidarity.”\nBaltimore Ravens players Crockett Gillmore, left, and Brandon Williams pose with Chesapeake senior basketball player Kara Blanchard while helping out with a T-shirt drive for the school's upcoming MS Awareness Night.

But that reality was threatened when she received the diagnosis a couple weeks before Christmas.\nWhen her vision began blurring early December, Blanchard didn’t connect it to the tingling in her feet from last April. She figured all would be fine once she flushed a hair strand from her eye.\nShe flushed and she flushed, but no strand came out. Her sight worsened. She started having trouble seeing her teammates on the court. Then she started suffering from severe headaches on the left side of her head.\nBlanchard eventually went to an ophthalmologist, who suggested she might have more than an eye issue and should see an MS specialist at Hopkins.\nAfter her MRI, Blanchard returned the next day with her father and mother, Michelle Blanchard. The lesions on her brain confirmed the worst.\n“It hit me super hard,” Blanchard said.\nWhen Gray finally gathered the team to break the news, senior Hallie Persell had a strong reaction. Her uncle has an advanced stage of the condition and is in a wheelchair.\n“She started crying,” Gray said. “No one knew why Hallie was crying so hard. And I knew she had an uncle dealing with it. I told Kara and said, ‘You two should talk to each other.’”\nThey did, but Blanchard didn’t stop with Persell. She joined a Facebook group called ‘ Athletes Fighting Multiple Sclerosis ’ and has been in contact with players from Northeast, Severna Park, Glen Burnie and Annapolis who know people suffering from MS.\nShe’s even received uplifting direct messages from random people on Twitter, and Baltimore Ravens player Crockett Gillmore and Brandon Williams helped out at a T-shirt sale last week.\nAfter Blanchard’s opthamologist prescribed a five-day intravenous steroid to curb her optic neuritis, a common result of MS, Blanchard’s vision returned to normal. She expects to begin taking medication later this week that should help prevent future lesions and relapses.\nShe has maintained her active lifestyle, and said she’s working harder than ever in practice; the exertion can only help her.\nWhen Blanchard checked into her first game back on Dec. 27 against Southwestern, nothing felt out of the ordinary.\nThat won’t be the case Tuesday. Gray isn’t quite sure what the gym’s maximum capacity is, but she expects to see bleachers packed with community members clad in the ‘Cougars for Kara’ shirts.\nBlanchard is typically the Cougars’ first player off the bench, but she’ll be in the starting lineup against the Gophers. She’ll hear her name called, run onto court and look out on the sea of orange surrounding her.\n“She’s the best one to have gotten it,” Joe Blanchard said. “She’s the one that’s going to beat it.”", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Athletes-Fighting-Multiple-Sclerosis-194861167327/"], "published": "2017-01-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:26:25.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
