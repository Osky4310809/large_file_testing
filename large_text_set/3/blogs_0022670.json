It was lucrative — plus painting glow-in-the-dark radium on soldiers’ wristwatch faces meant she and her young female co-workers were helping in the war effort.\nThe fact that they were also sudden local celebrities — dubbed the “ghost girls’’ because of their ever-present green glowing skin — didn’t hurt, either.\nThen Maggia’s teeth started inexplicably to fall out. Her body became racked by aches, and within two agonizing years, she was dead.\nNext came co-worker Helen Quinlan. Then Irene Rudolph. Then Catherine O’Donnell. Then Hazel Kuser.\nToday, 100 years later, the young women’s bodies still glow in their graves, the effects of radiation poisoning.\nBut while their story is laden with tragedy, their deaths set the stage for one of the most famous workers-rights court cases in US history — and ultimately saved thousands of lives.\nFew if any residents in the town today know the history of the former plant site. Quietly tucked into a tree-lined residential neighborhood, it has been renamed High & Alden Street Park and features a playground — perhaps a fitting tribute to the young lives lost.\n“I think it’s a good idea they [made it a park],’’ resident Robin Laurent, 40, recently told The Post after learning of its past. “It’s good for the people in the neighborhood and the people of Orange.’’\nThe playground that now stands on the site Richard Harbus ‘My beautiful radium,’’ Marie Curie once said of the element that made her famous, earning her two Nobel Prizes.\nShe discovered the mysterious substance in 1898 while working in a wooden shed serving as a laboratory across a courtyard from the Sorbonne’s School of Physics in Paris, France.\nSoon the world couldn’t get enough of it. It was the most powerful potential energy source that anyone had ever seen, even compared to a mythological super-being. In 1903, the Reno (Nev.) Gazette-Journal wrote that radium might have the power to turn metal into gold — and lead to communication between planets.\nBut in reality, very little was known about it.\nScientists were aware it could break down human tissue, and it had a wide, early success with cancer patients; it is still used today in cancer treatments. But it didn’t discriminate in the tissue it broke down.\n“It causes horrible sores, which are difficult to heal, while it will heal some of the most malignant,’’ the San Bernardino County (Calif.) Sun noted in 1909.\nMarie and Pierre Curie themselves suffered extreme burns from handling the element, and her prolonged exposure to its radiation ultimately killed her in 1934.\nBut despite the danger, radium became wildly popular with the public starting in the 1900s. There were super luxe, high-end radium “spas” where the rich and famous shelled out big bucks to cleanse and rejuvenate themselves with radium’s reputed magical, healthful effects. There also were radium waters, suppositories, toothpastes, lipsticks and perfumes.\nDoctors and businessmen eager to make a buck claimed that radium could cure everything from arthritis and gout to constipation, impotence and cancer.\nLittle did the public know it was a highly toxic substance that meant a death sentence for anyone regularly exposed to it.\nScientists were aware it could break down human tissue, and it had a wide, early success with cancer patients; it is still used today in cancer treatments. But it didn’t discriminate in the tissue it broke down.\nKatherine Schaub was 14 years old when she first heard about the Radium Luminous Materials Corp., which had just opened up in her neighborhood of Newark around 1917, according to Kate Moore’s book, “The Radium Girls.”\n“A friend of mine told me about the ‘watch studio’ where watch-dial numerals and hands were painted with a luminous substance that made them visible in the dark,’’ Schaub told Moore, whose book hits US shelves May 2.\n“The work, she explained, was interesting and of far higher type than the usual factory job.”\nThe company also was paying better than anywhere else in town — and, best of all, it gave the area’s working-class young women access to its coveted radium.\nSchaub and dozens of other girls flocked to the factory, which was opened in Newark before the nearby Orange site was established and they transferred over.\nThey began earning up to $20 a week, or nearly $40,000 annually in today’s dollars, about three times what the average factory worker was making. In some cases, the girls were earning more than their fathers, Moore says.\nWhen they left work, they literally glowed in the night from the radium powder on their bodies.\n“Nasal discharges on my handkerchief used to be luminous in the dark,” former worker Grace Fryer recalled.\nShe and her co-workers were the envy of the town. They painted their nails, lips and hair with radium. It was sexy and exhilarating.\nThey took extra pride in their job knowing that the glowing wristwatches they were painting were being used by World War I soldiers deep in the trenches who worked in the dark.\nAnd there was an element of romance. The girls would sometimes inscribe their names and addresses on the back of the watches and receive a note back from a soldier abroad, Moore writes.\nThe US government became one of the company’s biggest clients. By the end of 1918, one in six soldiers owned a luminescent watch, according to Moore.\nThe girls used ultra-fine, camel-hair brushes to paint the miniscule numbers, putting the brushes in their mouths to keep the points fine. It became standard operating procedure: Lip, dip, paint.\nThe radium hardened the brush, and “lip-pointing” softened it. One dial-painter noted that without lip-pointing, “It would have been impossible to have done much work.”\nRichard Harbus Managers at the plant, presumably aware of at least some of the danger, tried several times to stop the lip-pointing, but told the girls it must be done because the other methods wasted too much of the precious paint.\nIn the 1920s, a gram of radium — a mere thimbleful — cost more than $100,000, more than $2 million by today’s standards.\nMae Cubberley, another dial painter, recalled questioning bosses about lip-pointing.\n“The first thing we asked [was], ‘Does this stuff hurt you?’ And they said, ‘No,’ ” Cubberley recalled.\nThe boss in charge told the girls, “It wasn’t dangerous” and they “didn’t need to be afraid.”\nBut behind closed doors, company brass knew radium was a force to be reckoned with.\nSabin von Sochocky, the firm’s founder and lead chemist, delivered an ominous warning to Fryer one afternoon in the studio after he saw her lip-pointing.\n“Do not do that,” he said to her not once but twice, Moore writes. “It will make you sick.”\nFryer asked her manager about von Sochocky’s warning. The higher-up dismissed the chemist’s claims and said she had nothing to worry about.\nSo the girls lipped, dipped and painted away— blissfully unaware that they were slowly killing themselves.\nThen a co-worker, Maggia became seriously ill, and her doctors were perplexed.\nThey had no idea what was causing her afflictions, and they began pulling more and more teeth, desperate to stop the spreading infection. Eventually, Maggia’s jawbone broke in her doctor’s hands, and she died on Sept. 12, 1922, five years after she first began working at the company.\nThe girls lipped, dipped and painted away— blissfully unaware that they were slowly killing themselves.\nScores of her co-workers quickly followed. It all started the same way, and they all died slow, painful deaths shrouded in mystery.\nTheir “ghost girls’’ nickname was no longer glamorous. Instead, it took on a dark meaning, as many of them realized their deaths were imminent — and their employer, knowingly or not, had poisoned them for the sake of money.\nIn the early 1920s, workers’ rights were virtually nonexistent. The US Department of Labor was tipped off to the “ghost girls’ ’’ plight, but it barely registered a blip on the agency’s radar.\n“The Department of Labor was pro-business,’’ Moore notes. “Under state law, it had no authority to stop an industrial process, even if it was harmful.”\nAfter a brief investigation, government officials gave the plant a “clean bill of health.”\nEssex County’s medical examiner at the time, Dr. Harrison Martland, was the first to prove the deaths were caused by radium poisoning.\nIt was 1925, and the first male employee of the company, Dr. Edwin Lehman, had just died. Martland conducted an autopsy and found radium in Lehman’s bones and grew suspicious.\nMartland then performed a different test on some of the female workers who were still alive and realized they all had extreme levels of radium and it was poisoning them, too. After further studies, he determined that their condition was “incurable.”\n“When I first found out what I had and learned it was incurable . . . I was horror-stricken,” Fryer said. “I would look at people I knew and I would say to myself, ‘Well, I’ll never see you again.’ ”\nFive of the dying girls filed suit against the company — which by then had been renamed the United States Radium Corp. — in 1927, asking for $250,000 each.\nEvidence came from beyond the grave.\nWhile Maggia’s official cause of death had been recorded as syphilis, authorities didn’t even have to perform tests on her corpse when it was exhumed during the trial in 1927. Her body was aglow with a “soft luminescence,” clearly pointing to death by radiation.\nWith radium’s half-life of 1,600 years, she and the more than 50 people who died after working at the company’s factories are still glowing in their coffins to this day.\nBut her co-workers’ cases still dragged on with incessant postponements.\nCritics said the company was hoping the girls would die before they had the chance to testify. Some gave testimony from their beds, too weak to come to court.\nIt was later revealed the judge was a shareholder of the USRC.\nThe five young women ended up settling with the company, which admitted no wrongdoing. They were given $10,000 each and $600 a year for each year they lived, plus damages for their medical bills. They all died by the 1930s.\nSimilar companies would be litigating the same cases at different factories across the United States into the 1930s.\nUSRC finally closed in 1941, bankrupt and with no way out, given that it couldn’t find anyone willing to work in its factories anymore.\nAfter the lawsuits were settled, a government public-health conference was convened on radium-factory safety standards.\nJames Leake, a US Public Health Service official, commended the move to guarantee workers’ safety.\n“The martyrdom of a few may save many,” he said in reference to the tragic “ghost girls.’’\nAround the former factory site in Orange, it is hard to find anyone who has heard of its disturbing past.\nOnce told of the story, residents are sympathetic to its doomed workers’ plight — but then wonder in the same breath if the old site is safe for them and their kids.\n“I watched them recycle the dirt over and over and over,” said dad Jean-Claude Jacques, 55. “I figured it was safe, but now that I’m hearing people had died that used to work there, I don’t feel that it is.”\nA man who works at a barber shop down the street from the park added, “It’s not good, especially with kids out there playing. . . . I hope it doesn’t harm them.”\nBut Laurent says the park is a popular and necessary element to the neighborhood.\n“I think the way it is right now, it is better for the kids,” he said. “I don’t think there’s anything toxic here anymore.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:12:07.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
