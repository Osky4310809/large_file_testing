The musical apocalypse is here. Coldplay and the Chainsmokers have a song together, and it sounds exactly the way you’d expect a Coldplay/Chainsmokers song to sound. The gentle house beats! The gooey synths! The Chris Martin doo doo doo s! The guitar solo that sounds like morse code! The first line on the song is “I’ve been reading books of old,” and Martin somehow delivers it with what sounds like a straight face! Chris Martin is looking for someone with some superhuman gifts! Somebody he can talk to! Somebody he can kiss! It’s all just so wonderfully foul! The song will appear on the Chainsmokers forthcoming album Memories… Do Not Open , and you can experience it below. \nMemories… Do Not Open is out 4/7 on Disruptor / Columbia .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:25:48.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
