He was 94.\nDuva died of natural causes, according to his son Dino Duva, ending more than seven decades of contribution to the Sweet Science. Duva handled the careers of 19 world champions — including Holyfield, Pernell Whitaker and Meldrick Taylor.\n“The overwhelming number of calls and sympathy wishes from so many friends and associates shows how much our father was loved and respected,” Dino said in a statement. We sincerely appreciate the support from everyone.”\nLou Duva was born on May 28, 1922, in New York City to Italian immigrants. The family later moved to Paterson. He was introduced to boxing at age 10, and by the 1950s he was hanging around area gyms and helping to train fighters.\nIn 1978, his son, Dan, formed Main Events to put on boxing shows in Totowa, N.J. Lou Duva served as manager and trainer to the fighters. Soon Main Events was attracting top talent from across the country and became one of the most powerful boxing promotional companies in the world.\nDuva always was quick with a joke or a smile. But he could be as combative as some of his fighters if he thought his side wasn’t getting a fair shake. Holyfield once said he regretted firing Duva as his trainer after Holyfield lost to Riddick Bowe in 1992.\n“Lou Duva wouldn’t let anyone do anything to me,” Holyfield once said. “I let Lou go and all of sudden everyone started trouble from all over. A lot of things I went through wouldn’t have happened to me if I still had Lou. I made my life harder when I got rid of the man. I didn’t know how important it was to have somebody argue for you.”\nDuva is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame, the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame and the Meadowlands Sports Hall of Fame.\nA viewing is scheduled for 3-7 p.m. Sunday at the Festa Funeral Home in Totowa, N.J. The funeral is at 10 a.m. Monday at St. Mary’s R.C. Church in Paterson.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:52:49.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
