With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won't.\" Patriots Martellus Bennett & Devin McCourty raise clenched fists at end of “The Star-Spangled Banner’’ Sunday night. pic.twitter.com/nNPTdQt9ts — John Nichols (@NicholsUprising) September 12, 2016 \nMcCourty is the second Patriots player to take this stance. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters shortly after their historic come-from-behind victory on Sunday that he would not attend any ceremony at the White House. When pressed about why, Bennett urged people to check out his social media feed, which includes statements in opposition to Trump policies like the immigration ban that was imposed on seven Muslim-Majority countries before being halted by a federal judge Friday. America was built on inclusiveness not exclusiveness. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) January 30, 2017 \nIt is perhaps not surprising that McCourty and Bennett would be united in their opposition to Trump. They were the only two Patriots players to raise their fists in silent protest while the National Anthem played during the regular NFL season. The act was in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's similar demonstration , meant to raise awareness about police brutality and racial inequality. \nRelated: Colin Kaepernick National Anthem Protest Catches On in NFL \nOn Monday, in an interview ESPN's \"SportsCenter,\" Bennett, now a free agent, further explained why he would sit out a White House visit. While he said he didn't begrudge any of his teammates for going, his decision was \"a personal belief and a personal thing for me.\" \n\"Is it a big deal? I think so,\" he said. \"I think for the people I represent and the culture I represent, it's huge.\" Play", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T19:12:15.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
