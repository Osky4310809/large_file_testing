The popular anime block left audiences of all ages glued to their televisions as they watch warriors like Goku and Vegeta take on insanely powerful enemies who wanted to destroy their home. Other anime series like Sailor Moon also aired alongside the Super Saiyan spectacle, and it looks like Toonami is gearing up to revisit its glory days. This year, the late-night program is kicking things off right with a stellar line-up of popular shows, and it will make a night owl out of any anime fan. UP NEXT: Dragon Ball Super Toonami Premiere Date Announced \nOver on Facebook, Toonami debuted a brand-new trailer for its 2017 program, and it is a doozy. The program will kick off a half hour earlier than normal to debut the English dub of Dragon Ball Super at 11:30 p.m. on January 7th. Afterwards, Dragon Ball Z Kai: The Final Chapters will have its dubbed premiere as Goku and the Z-Fighters enter the Majin Buu Saga. \nStarting at 12:30 a.m., Toonami continues with JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure followed by Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn . Hunter x Hunter then has its start at 1:30 a.m. before Naruto: Shippuden comes in ahead of One Piece and One-Punch Man . \nFor shonen fans, there may be not better time to get in on Toonami’s action than 2017. Sure, the program may run late, but it is one of the best ways to catch-up on all things anime before 2017 rings in a slew of new seasons and shows. \nFor instance, whe Dragon Ball Super makes its debut, it will be doing so from the first episode. It will take awhile for Toonami to catch up with the show’s 70+ episodes, but it will be worth the wait. In February, a brand-new story arc is set to kick off with the ‘Universal Survival’ saga. You can check out the brief synopsis for it below: \n“At Goku’s request, the Omni-Kings’“Tournament of Power” martial arts tournament between universes now begins! …But this also proves to be the beginning of universal destruction. What awaits the victors of this tournament, and the vanquished…?! How will these intense team battles between the elites of each universe turn out…?!” \nShortly after the arc was announced, producer Shunki Hashizume had this to say about the impending saga. “Dragon Ball Super enters its new chapter, the “Universe Survival Arc”. As you can see from the main visual, it’ll be a full-throttle story where Goku and the rest of the Universe 7 warriors form a team to take on a tournament between universes!” he wrote. \n“Artificial Human No. 17 and Majin Boo are there too, so personally I can’t contain my excitement at the thought of what kind of fights we’ll see! Look forward to this new chapter that’ll be sure to feature super-intense battles with nonstop appearances by the elites of each universe!” \nSo, what do you think?
