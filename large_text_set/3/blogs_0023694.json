(But be warned, if you don’t know how to flash your device, you’re probably gonna screw something up and brick your phone. Again, this version is strictly for developers.) \nAssuming Google follows Nougat’s rollout, Android O will likely get a public beta version at its annual I/O dev conference in May, with a public rollout sometime in the fall. \nThough Google’s not quite ready to reveal everything on Android O, the company shared a number of new features that should get Android fans excited. 1. Improved battery life \nAs always, Google’s clamping down on power consumption to improve battery life. In Android O, the operating system automatically limits background app activity to help conserve power. 2. Tidier notifications \nNotifications can now be sorted into “channels,” as opposed to just grouping them all by app. For example, Android O can group all notifications from a single user from, say, a chat app into a channel, which sounds like it’ll be way tidier. 3. Picture-in-Picture \nAndroid O also supports picture-in-picture (PiP) so you can watch a video while looking at another app, a new app overlay window, and the ability to launch an activity on a remote display using multi-display support. 4. Adaptive icons \nApp icons can also be adaptive and change shapes based on different themes. Additionally, Android O can animate icons when they’re touched. 5. Better-sounding wireless audio \nListening to music through wired headphones on Android is fine. Using wireless headphones, however, can be a crapshoot. With a new Audio API, wireless sound should get a boost thanks to higher performance codecs like Sony’s LDAC, which allows for cleaner sound with less latency. If you’ve ever used wireless headphones to watch videos on your Android phone, only to realize the audio is out of sync with the picture, you’ll know wireless audio still has a ways to go. 6. Wide-color gamut support \nPhone displays keep getting better and better. Not only are they brighter and crisper than ever before, but they can also display a wider range of colors. With wide-color gamut (WCG) support, apps will be able to display more colors for more expressive designs. WCG support also means photos and videos will look even better on WCG-supported screens. 7. Keyboard navigation \nAndroid O’s also getting better keyboard support for improved app navigation. Google says it’s “focused on building a more reliable, predictable model for ‘arrow’ and ‘tab’ navigation” for Chromebooks and devices with larger form factors. \nWhile these seven features are definitely worth getting excited for, they’re by no means the only new things in Android O. You can find a full list of all the less flashy features coming here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:53:13.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
