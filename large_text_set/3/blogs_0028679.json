Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFrank Lampard has been backed to become a top manager by his former Chelsea teammate Graeme Le Saux following his retirement last month. \nThe former England international has wasted little time in making the transition towards a new career after ending his spell in MLS with New York City and has joined Le Saux at the Blues' Cobham training ground to begin his coaching education. \nLe Saux, a Premier League winner with Blackburn and once the most expensive English defender after moving back to Stamford Bridge for Â£5.5m in 1997, believes Lampard's intelligence and great experience can help him become a top manager. \n\"We are both at very early stages but you find out a lot about yourself as you're going through it,\" Le Saux told Mirror Sport on behalf of the FA Mars Just Play programme, which has just reached one million attendances at sessions across the country. \n\"You're always learning, that's the key about being a top level coach. I've known Frank since he was a young player at Chelsea, coming for a huge price tag from West Ham.

What he's achieved and the experience he has are all fantastic qualities he can bring to management. \n\"It's down to him if he wants to do it and use those experiences he has had and put a stamp on what he wants to do. It's fascinating.\" \nAntonio Conte has become an instant favourite at Le Saux's former club thanks largely to his 3-4-3 system, which has put the Blues on the brink of a fifth Premier League title.
