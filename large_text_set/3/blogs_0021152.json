SportsLine \nDuke freshman Jayson Tatum will declare for the NBA Draft and sign with an agent, the program announced in a statement on Wednesday. \n“I have absolutely loved coaching Jayson Tatum,” Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “His skill set and work ethic will make him a star in the NBA . Whichever team selects him will be getting a humble, thoughtful and talented young man who we are proud to call a member of the Duke basketball brotherhood.” \nAt 6-foot-8 and the ability to score it from anywhere on the floor, Tatum will be a hot commodity in the draft. He is a versatile forward who played both small forward and power forward last season. CBS Sports experts Gary Parrish and Howard Megdal both project he will be a top-10 pick in the upcoming draft. Tatum averaged 16.8 points and 7.3 rebounds per game for the Blue Devils this season.
