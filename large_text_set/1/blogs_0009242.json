They’ll be busy dealing with its effects,” Obama said in his Chicago speech. \nObama said that to “deny the problem not only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country,” clearly taking aim at the incoming Trump administration. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump promised to rollback Obama administration energy and environment regulations he sees as hampering U.S. competitiveness, including signature global warming rules for power plants. \nTrump also pledged to “cancel” a United Nations agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions the Obama administration spearheaded. \nDemocrats and environmentalists attacked Trump for appointing “climate deniers” to top administration posts. They’ve taken special aim at Trump’s pick to head the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt; there’s no evidence he ever “denied” global warming . \nObama’s farewell speech not only highlighted his presidential legacy, but gave his thoughts on major problems still facing the country — from race relations to economic inequality to global warming. \nHe also claimed Americans won’t be able to solve problems “without some common baseline of facts.” Obama was probably referring to liberal complaints of “fake news” propelling Trump to victory in November. \nFollow Michael on Facebook and Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
