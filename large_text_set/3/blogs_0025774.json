He grew up as a talented multisport athlete, dabbling in soccer, hockey, and competitive diving. \nHe also had fixation on a particular holiday feature. \n“I’ve always been obsessed with Christmas elves,” Elf said. “At Christmastime, they are the ones who are all smiley and the driving force behind making kids happy. I played an elf in a school play four years in a row and everyone just knew me as the elf around Christmas.” \nHe thought it was fun and wanted to make the passion part of his identity. So two years ago, he underwent a five-hour operation to morph the tops of his ears into a point. The procedure cuts out a pie-shaped portion of skin, then sews the ends back together to form the sharpened apex. Elf (then with the last name Sayles) was awake during the surgery. He watched Interstellar , and of course, the Will Ferrell-classic, Elf , to distract himself from the pain.

His passport and other legal documents now read “Jessey The Elf.” \nTwo weeks after he broke 16 minutes with his dog at the Frosty 5K in southern Ontario, Elf spoke with Runner’s World on a video call to talk about another part of his identity—becoming an elite triathlete. He appeared wearing no shirt, sporting luminous green hair. \nFor the past seven years, Elf has established himself as a rising talent in southern Ontario’s triathlete scene. He discovered the sport at 15, when a high school friend dared him to compete in a race. \n“I absolutely hated it,” Elf said. “I breast-stroked like half the swim and started walking halfway through the run. But at the finish they gave me a medal, and I felt so accomplished, so I started signing up for more.” \nSince then, Elf has notched several podium and overall finishes in triathlons around Canada and the U.S. In 2016 he took 18th overall at the Canadian National Triathlon Championships. \nHe trains with a club in Waterdown, Ontario, called the Fighting Koalas. He said that his swim and bike times are in good enough shape to compete with the country’s top triathletes, but he knew he needed to improve his running to get to that next level. \nTo do this, he runs about 65 percent of his weekly miles with Hunter Buxbaum, a Hungarian Viszla that he and his partner brought home a year and a half ago. A post shared by Jessey The Elf (@jesseytheelf) on Feb 23, 2017 at 12:37pm PST \nThe dog/elf duo started registering for local 5Ks last year, breaking 18 minutes in their debut. \nThey won their next 5K together in 16:57, taking home a free year’s worth of dog food for the top finish. Elf also submitted the time to Guinness World Records. There is no current category for the record, but Guinness did confirm that they've received the application and it is under review. Hunter and Elf have since broken the mark twice, their best being the 15:26 in March. \n“People always say that Hunter is pulling me along during the race,” Elf said. “He does not know how to pace, so anything over a kilometer I have to keep him under control and pull him along to the finish.” \nElf’s short-term goal is to break 15 minutes in the 5K with Hunter. He admits, though, that his long-term goal is to qualify for the Olympics in Tokyo as a triathlete. \n“Qualifying will come down to the run,” he said. “When the Olympic champions are running a 29-minute 10K off the bike, that is scary to me right now.” \nElf said that changing his name and ears has helped his training. \n“I am having a lot more fun,” he said. “I used to be really serious and competitive. It would destroy me if I had a bad performance. Now I just enjoy competing and I smile a lot more.” \nHe said spectators and other competitors are curious, and ask him a lot of the same questions before and after races. \n“People ask if, psychologically, I actually think I am an elf,” Elf said while laughing. “It is not to that level. I just think it is cool having such a different name and pointed ears. It’s really out there.” \nHe does, however, ascribe to at least one essential aspect of an elf’s lifestyle—making the four elf food groups a regular part of his diet. \n“I always have my maple syrup,” he said, while holding a large jug of the sweet topping. “My candy canes are in the other room.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:25:27.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
