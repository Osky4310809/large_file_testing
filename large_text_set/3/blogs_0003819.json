McKibben also lost a vacation day for the accident after the Denver Department of Safety determined he had violated a rule against rough or careless handling of city property, according to a copy of his disciplinary letter obtained by The Denver Post.\nThe German Shepherd lost a piece of her ear but recovered from other non-life threatening injuries, the letter said. She has returned to full duty.\nThe accident happened on Dec. 14 at Denver International Airport after McKibben took Nicki, an explosives detection dog, on a play break, the letter said.\nWhen it was time to leave, McKibben ordered Nicki to get into her kennel in his patrol car. At the same time, the officer mistakenly threw the dog toy under the car, the letter said.\nMcKibben thought he had secured the latch on Nicki’s kennel and got into the car to pull it forward so he could reach the toy. But Nicki had jumped out of the kennel and had scurried underneath the car to get her toy, the letter said.\nRelated Articles January 9, 2017 Denver police horse dies after officer forgot he was tied in stall without food or water March 3, 2017 Off-duty Castle Rock police officer fatally shoots attacking dog on Parker trail February 24, 2017 Dog shot by suspect in Colorado Springs home-invasion robbery, police say McKibben drove over the dog.
