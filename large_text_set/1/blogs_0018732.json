Some thought a recall was imminent, but that investigation has now concluded, with no recall in sight.\nThough the loss of life is tragic and shows Tesla still has much work to do, the 13-page report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) seems to suggest the vehicles are still safer on the whole because of the feature.\n“This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us.\nFIND OUT WHY A key finding was that airbag-deploying crashes dropped “by almost 40 percent” since Tesla introduced the Autopilot feature. That doesn’t seem to control for any other Tesla updates that could have improved safety in the same time window, but it’s still a significant figure.\nWho would’ve thunk it; computers may be better at driving than humans at driving after all. But it’s also important to understand their limitations.\n\nAn important argument in the report is that Tesla’s automatic emergency braking (AEB), and those of other companies, are not designed to avoid all types of accidents.\nIn particular, none of the vehicles studied by the administration were designed to prevent collisions in which another vehicle is crossing perpendicularly in front of you. The report notes that “braking for crossing path collisions, such as that present in the Florida fatal crash, are outside the expected performance capabilities of the system.”\nEmergency braking systems are not yet designed to consistently prevent this kind of accident. The report also differentiates between Autopilot mode – which is meant to basically be an enhanced cruise control with some steering – and AEB, which is a separate system that works regardless of Autopilot being on or off.\nData from the crash shows that Tesla’s emergency braking system did not activate – again, it wasn’t designed for that kind of collision – but also that the driver had “at least seven seconds” to see the truck the vehicle crashed into, where most of the crashes studied develop in less than three to four seconds.\nEven with such short notice, the report suggests that most drivers will try to break or steer away, but in the Florida crash, the driver took “no braking, steering, or other actions” to prevent the crash. The driver of the truck he crashed into said the man had been watching a Harry Potter movie , but there is no evidence to confirm that claim.\n\n\nOf course, part of the argument against Tesla is that you wouldn’t even be", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:47:11.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
