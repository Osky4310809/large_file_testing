Terrill \nLOS ANGELES — Stephen Curry scored 29 points despite making just three 3-pointers, Kevin Durant added 26 points and 10 assists, and the Golden State Warriors defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 133-120 for their fifth straight victory on Thursday night (Friday Manila time). \nBlake Griffin had 31 points, making 11 of 13 free throws, for the Clippers. They have lost nine in a row to their Bay Area opponents, the franchise's longest active skid against a single team. \nThe rematch wasn't the debacle that occurred last weekend when the Clippers lost by 46 points at Golden State. \nBut they still never led and trailed by 21. The Clippers got beat in every category despite Griffin's hard-charging effort. The Warriors were dominant in the paint, on second-chance points and fast break points. \nGolden State has won 11 of its last 12. \nThe Clippers got within seven on a 3-pointer by Jamal Crawford with 1:55 remaining in the game. But Durant answered with a 3-pointer and Klay Thompson added another.   \nThe Clippers' defense was no match for Curry. He slipped through the lane for a fastbreak layup with Raymond Felton dogging him on the left and DeAndre Jordan on the right. Curry fell down scoring, drawing the foul and completing the three-point play that kept the Warriors ahead by 15 in the third quarter. \nThe Warriors toyed with the Clippers, who got within four points in the first quarter and then five in the second quarter, only to have Golden State immediately push the lead back to double digits. \nGolden State barreled around the court, knocking down former Warrior Marreese Speights and J.J. Redick in one fell swoop after Durant pushed Austin Rivers on another possession. It was all part of a rollicking first half when the Warriors bobbed, weaved and whipped circus-like passes around before scoring. \nThe Clippers gave up three dunks and had four turnovers to start the game. Curry forced two steals, feeding Durant and JaVale McGee for consecutive dunks that stunned the Clippers. \nLos Angeles outshot Golden State in the first quarter when the Warriors took nearly twice as many shots as the Clippers. \nMaking history \nCurry hit his 200th 3-pointer of the season with 2 ½ minutes left in the second quarter, making him the first player in NBA history to have 200 or more 3-pointers in five consecutive seasons. He missed his first four 3-pointers in the game. Curry came into the game 4 of 28 from 3-point range in three previous games at Staples Center this season. \nHighlight reel \nGriffin's windmill dunk over Warriors forward Kevon Looney drew oohs from the crowd and merited multiple replays on the video board. He took one large step through the lane and pushed his left hand off the head of a ducking Looney as Griffin elevated before slamming the ball down with his right hand. \nTip-ins \nWarriors: Curry had 11 assists. ... McGee and James Michael McAdoo each finished 5 of 6 from the field. They were among seven Warriors in double figures. ... Curry got a technical for smacking the ball out of bounds in the second quarter. ... They have reached 100 points in each of the last 26 games. ... They were missing starting forward Draymond Green, who has a left shoulder contusion. \nClippers: Griffin passed Hall of Famer Bob McAdoo to move into second on the franchise scoring list. ... Los Angeles is 2-5 in its last seven without injured Chris Paul. ... Jordan will participate in the slam dunk competition on Feb. 18 during All-Star weekend in New Orleans against Orlando's Aaron Gordon, Phoenix's Derrick Jones Jr. and Indiana's Glenn Robinson III. Jordan leads the league with 152 dunks this season.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:12:07.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
