Until it's official, fans will be nervous By Benjamin Hochman St. Louis Post-Dispatch 5 hrs ago \nMizzou fans don’t get cautiously optimistic; they get minimally pessimistic. \nThe nation’s No. 1 basketball player said he’s considering playing for the Tigers? \nHere’s the fans’ fear: They’ll enter their home one night, turn on the light, and there’s Tyus Edney, Nebraska receiver Matt Davison, the 2012 Norfolk State basketball team and a guy holding a fifth-down marker, all simultaneously screaming: “Gotcha!” \nThings like Michael Porter Jr. don’t happen to Mizzou often. Things like this happen to (dare I say) Kansas. But on Wednesday, the mythical figure spoke, and no, he didn’t announce he’s coming to Mizzou — but darn if it he didn’t sound like he’s serious about doing so. \n“To be able to go back (to Columbia), I know those Mizzou fans are hungry — and I’ve been shown a lot of love from Mizzou fans,” Porter Jr. said on a conference call upon winning Gatorade’s award for national player of the year, which Jayson Tatum won last year. “It could be something real, real special just to come home and do my thing there, it would special.” \nMPJ confirmed that his father, Michael Porter Sr., has been offered a job as a Cuonzo Martin assistant at Missouri. \nMPJ affirmed that he’s getting out of his national letter of intent with Washington, which fired Lorenzo Romar. \nMPJ shared that he met Martin in the past week, and that “I’ve heard all great things about him.” \nTo think — what Porter Jr. could do to the Mizzou way of thinking. \nIt could reprogram the Mizzou psyche. \nAnd it could reignite the Mizzou imagination. \nIf Porter Jr. and his brother, Jontay, both play for the Tigers next season, is an eight-win team an Elite Eight team? How about this — the Tigers are, at least, a tournament team. When your best player becomes, arguably, your third-best player, that’s elevation. And to think, point guard Terrance Phillips cut down on the turnovers significantly in the final six games. And Jordan Barnett had some standout performances. And Kevin Puryear is my favorite current Tiger to watch play basketball — he’s forever voracious. \nOn Wednesday, Porter Jr. mentioned these fellows. It was almost surreal — wait, the best high school player in the whole country can even name some Mizzou players? \nHe did, of course, live in Columbia from elementary school through his junior year in high school. And two sisters play for Mizzou’s heralded women’s team, coached by Porter Jr.’s aunt. \n“It would be amazing to back there with them,” he said. “Family is important to me, so that’s a big consideration.” \nWednesday was an important day, I say. He spoke! And the kid didn’t shy away from questions about Mizzou. He said the right things about “weighing my options” and all that. But he gave clarity to questions that loom, notably: Will he play wherever his dad accepts a coaching gig? \n“It’s not a for-sure thing that I would follow him but, it does make sense if he goes to a big school,” Porter Jr. said. “I do want to play under my dad. It’s not him forcing me or anything, I just trust my dad, love my dad and I just want to be close to family. And that would be a great situation for me.” \nAnd, despite all the adorable Columbia ties, why would the best player in the whole country go to a team that won only eight games? \n“I’ve always been the type of kid who wants to go make a difference at a school,” said Porter Jr., whose prep team won three games the year before he and Jontay arrived. “Coming out here to Seattle, that being who I am, I decided to go to Nathan Hale (High School) even before I knew Brandon (Roy) would be the coach. I went there knowing I could make a big difference at a school that didn’t have anything like that before. So with college, I don’t want it to be any different. I want to go somewhere where I feel like I can help change the program and do something special.” \nThis all just sounds too good to be true.
