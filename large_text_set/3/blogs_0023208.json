At no fault of yours, you were out of carriers and said you could not take my empty cup (trash).\n(Picture: Reddit) ‘I was less than understanding and my manner was curt. I need to apologize. The thought of leaving a trail of unkindness like that is not the path I want to reflect. Not for you, not for me. You are a young man, clearly working hard to build a fortune and you should be commended.\n‘Keep your attitude of cheer & hope. Stay hopeful no matter what kind of people cross your path (or drive thru). Surely, God has good blessing in store. You taught this ole lady something yesterday about kindness, compassion & staying humble. I thank you!\n‘God bless you today and all your todays. Debbie.’\nThe barista was so overwhelmed by the apology that he took a photo of it and uploaded it to Reddit , where he explained the reasoning for the letter.\n(Picture: Getty) The barista, Reddit user CircleAddict, explained that rude customers are something he experiences on a daily basis – but he always manages to keep his calm.\nHe said: ‘One thing I’ve really experienced in customer service is misplaced anger and frustration. People have a very hard time venting and healthily getting rid of their anger and they end up taking it out on others.\n‘I get it from customers, my fellow co-workers, my manager, and many others. I try not to let my anger and frustration influence my behavior much.\n‘Obviously, it still happens at times, I’m not perfect. I still try to put on a happy face and be helpful even when I’m angry and super negative on the inside. It definitely has helped with my interactions.’\nBut the user has said that he forgives the rude customer completely – as he found the note to be such an ‘incredibly kind gesture’, that doesn’t happen often – and so he’s got to appreciate it.\n(Picture: Getty) More: Food 10 ways to tell if your glass of wine is any good \nPepsi have released the UK's first cola and ginger soft-drink combination \nA breastfeeding cafe is about to open - and they're looking for staff \nHe explained: ‘People seldomly apologize for rudeness, and she went above and beyond to apologize to me. She obviously felt bad and is a genuinely good person. The card was still incredibly heartwarming to read.\n‘Funny thing is that I didn’t even think she was that rude even. I had forgotten about the incident 5 minutes later.’\nMORE: Spring is coming: Starbucks are about to launch their first-ever Spring cups \nMORE: Starbucks have a secret code for if they forget your name ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:25:33.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
