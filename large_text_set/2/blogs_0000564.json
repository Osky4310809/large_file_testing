At a ruck contest, she guided the ball down to her deadly foot and slotted it through the goalposts before anyone had time to think. \nThe third came when she got on the end of Carlton’s cleanest passage of play — a coast-to-coast goal which was signed, sealed and delivered by Carlton’s marquee star. \n“It was a team effort, I just finished off their hard work. I’m happy about it,” Vescio told Channel 7 post-match. \n“I think we just played with a lot of freedom and brought in our strengths into the game. Everyone just played a ripper and we played just as a team. It was unreal.” \nVescio, like Betts, is a nightmare to match up on. Darcy Vescio kicked four goals.

Play too small and she’ll defeat you in the air. \nAgile, explosive, crafty and dynamic, Vescio has the star power to match her marquee status. And she backed it up with her magic in the historic inaugural AFLW match. \nA big time player who took home the best on ground honours in Darebin’s 2016 flag, she again rose to the occasion. \nHer Darebin skipper Daisy Pearce remarked Vescio had been an “out and out star tonight, not just with her skills but in the air and at ground level”. \nFor much of the match, Nicola Stevens — Collingwood’s first draft pick — was her opponent. \nIf it weren’t for an ACL injury in 2014, Stevens would have more than likely earned marquee status. She’s no slouch, making Vescio’s feats all the more impressive. \nLike Betts, Vescio doesn’t need too much of the pill to have a profound effect on the result. At half time, it was six possessions for three goals. \nIn the third term, it was a long run that will only show for one kick. But it involved a bounce, an error, a recovery and a 50 metre entry. \nThen it was a handball out of congestion that led to the first goal of the second half, a stand and deliver from her marquee sister Brianna Davey that gave the Blues a 20-point buffer. \nBut not to be outdone, she booted the next major, an around the body snap from 30 metres that dribbled through with delight. Carlton’s Darcy Vescio led her team to victory. Picture: Wayne Ludbey Source: News Corp Australia \nLike a true star, it was a siren-to-siren performance. When lining up for her fifth she selflessly gave the ball off to her skipper Lauren Arnell, who was closer to goal. \nShe missed, but it showed Vescio has equal spades of disciple and design. \nIn front of a packed home crowd, Vescio loved every minute. \n“That was insane. Just the numbers, the crowd, the game — it was so fast and the girls did so well,” Vescio said. \n“The roar, we could hardly here anything out here. It was just amazing, hearing the crowd get up \nand about and that is what it is all about. We just want people to come and watch us play and see what we create.” \nAnd so for all the talk of the damage Collingwood star Mo Hope would inflict, Vescio emerged at the opposite end as the player most likely. \nA livewire forward is back at Carlton. \nJust don’t tell Adelaide.
