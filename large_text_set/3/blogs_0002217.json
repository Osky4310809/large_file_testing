The Philippine delegation’s hard work to lobby the 1.5-degree climate goal during the Paris negotiations has finally paid off,” De Guzman said in a statement. \n“This is a clear articulation of his marching orders for the Climate Change Commission in the succeeding months… I share our President’s vision for a healthier and more sustainable future for the Filipino people,” he said. \nDuterte on Tuesday inked the Instrument of Ratification, which will be submitted to the Senate at 2 p.m. Wednesday to concur in its ratification, according to Sen. Loren Legarda. \nThe President earlier said he would not honor the Paris climate pact, questioning the Philippines’ ability to meet the 70-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. He also said the cap would hinder the country’s economic growth. \nBACKSTORY: Duterte says ‘No’ to historic climate change pact \nDe Guzman said the climate agreement’s goal of reducing global temperature increase to 1.5°C was “our last threshold of chance and hope.” \n“I believe that our President’s resolve for climate action will keep us in the right direction of attaining social justice. With this greater task at hand, we, in the CCC, will remain steadfast in our commitment to pursue efforts in keeping with the principles manifested in the Paris Agreement,” De Guzman said. \n“I commend Senator Loren Legarda, UN Global Champion for Resilience, who has been passionate and constant in her commitment and advocacy to ratify the Paris Agreement,” he added. \nLegarda, a climate expert, was tapped by Duterte as de facto chair of the CCC when he convened the commission last Jan. 31. To date, 133 countries of the 197 parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change have ratified the Paris accord.
