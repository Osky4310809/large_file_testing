Answering questions for Sky Sports , the prominent journalist said the Galacticos have no bias between the potential signings of the Manchester United and Chelsea stoppers. \"I'm not sure if there is a preference toward one because they have targeted both, and that's a normal approach,\" Balague said. \"Go for both and either get one of them, or force the other to think they are not first choice, both outcomes which work in the club's favour.\" OLI SCARFF/Getty Images According to Spanish journalist Eduardo Inda (via Charles Perrin for the Express ), De Gea has set his heart on returning to the city of his birth and wants to sign for Real despite previously featuring for bitter rivals Atletico Madrid . \"Real Madrid are still thinking about a single goalkeeper, who is De Gea, but [Jose] Mourinho is determined not to [let him] leave United,\" Inda told Spanish TV show El Chiringuito (h/t Perrin). \"De Gea believes that Manchester is hell because every day is black. The player has privately said that he wants to play for Real Madrid.\" Ian Walton/Getty Images Mourinho's intervention will be key for the Red Devils, as the manager attempts to sell his ambition to his widely respected No. 1. The self-proclaimed Special One recently said he believes the Spain international is settled in Manchester. \"The only thing that is real is that [De Gea] is my player, I am happy with him, I know that he is happy with me,\" he said, per Luke Edwards for the Telegraph . De Gea has continued his fine form in the nets for United, achieving 10 clean sheets in 26 Premier League appearances, according to Squawka . Mike Hewitt/Getty Images Chris Hatherall of the Sunday Mirror reported Courtois could be tempted to move back to Spain in a Â£ 25.9 million transfer. Both players are elite goalkeepers, and it is not a surprise Balague believes Real would be happy with either man. De Gea has risen through the ranks to be on par with Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer as the world's best, but Courtois was hugely respected during his loan spell at Atletico. United and Chelsea are likely to fight hard to retain their world-class players, forcing Madrid to be aggressive when agreeing an asking price for their services.
