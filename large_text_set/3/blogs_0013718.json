Similarly, commodities can be an important way for investors to diversify beyond traditional stocks and bonds, or to profit from a conviction about price movements. \nIt used to be that most people did not invest in commodities because doing so required significant amounts of time, money and expertise. Today, there are a number of different routes to the commodity markets , and some of these routes make it easy for even the average investor to participate. This article should help you determine which tools will suit you best for investing in commodities . Futures Market \nA popular way to invest in commodities is through a futures contract , which is an agreement to buy or sell, in the future, a specific quantity of a commodity at a specific price. Futures are available on commodities such as crude oil , gold and natural gas, as well as agricultural products such as cattle or corn. \nMost of the participants in the futures markets are commercial or institutional users of the commodities they trade. These hedgers may use the commodity markets to take a position that will reduce the risk of financial loss due to a change in price. Other participants, mainly individuals, are speculators who hope to profit from changes in the price of the futures contract. Speculators typically close out their positions before the contract is due and never take actual delivery of the commodity (e.g. grain, oil, etc.) itself. \nInvesting in a futures contract will require you to open up a new brokerage account , if you do not have a broker that also trades futures, and to fill out a form acknowledging that you understand the risks associated with futures trading . \nEach commodity contract requires a different minimum deposit , depending on the broker, and the value of your account will increase or decrease with the value of the contract. If the value of the contract goes down, you will be subject to a margin call and will be required to place more money into your account to keep the position open. Due to the huge amounts of leverage , small price movements can mean huge returns or losses, and a futures account can be wiped out or doubled in a matter of minutes. \nMost futures contracts will also have options associated with them. Options on futures contracts still allow you to invest in the futures contract, but limit your loss to the cost of the option. Options are derivatives and usually do not move point-for-point with the futures contract. \nAdvantages: It's a pure play on the underlying commodity. \nLeverage allows for big profits if you are on the right side of the trade. \nMinimum-deposit accounts control full-size contracts that you would normally not be able to afford. You can go long or short easily. \nDisadvantages: \nThe futures markets can be very volatile and direct investment in these markets can be very risky, especially for inexperienced investors. \nLeverage magnifies both gains and losses. A trade can go against you quickly and you could lose your initial deposit (and more) before you are able to close your position. Stocks \nMany investors looking for a commodity play use stocks, which are less prone to volatile price swings than the futures market . Stock investors need to do some research to help ensure that a particular company is a good investment as well as a good commodity play. \nOil companies allow investors to select from drillers, refiners, tanker companies or diversified oil companies . Stocks are easy to buy, hold, trade and track, and it is possible to play a particular sector. \nStock options , which require a smaller investment than buying stocks directly, are another way to invest in commodities. While risk is limited to the cost of the option, the price movement will not usually directly mirror the underlying stock. \nAdvantages: \nInvestors usually already have a brokerage account, so trading is easier. \nPublic information on a company's financial situation is readily available. The stocks are often highly liquid . \nDisadvantages: \nA stock is not a pure play on commodity prices. Its price may be influenced by company-specific factors as well as market conditions. Exchange Traded Funds and Exchange Traded Notes \nExchange traded funds (ETFs) and exchange traded notes (ETNs), which trade like stocks, allow investors to participate in commodity price fluctuations without investing directly in futures contracts. \nCommodity ETFs usually track the price of a particular commodity or group of commodities that comprise an index by using futures contracts, although a few back the ETF with the actual commodity held in storage. \nETNs are unsecured debt designed to mimic the price fluctuation of a particular commodity or commodity index , and are backed by the issuer . A special brokerage account is not required to invest in ETFs or ETNs. \nAdvantages: \nBecause they trade like stocks, there are no management or redemption fees to worry about. They provide an easy way to participate in the price fluctuation of a commodity or basket of commodities. \nDisadvantages: \nA big move in the commodity may not be reflected point-for-point by the underlying ETF or ETN. \nNot all commodities have an ETF or ETN associated with them. ETNs have credit risk associated with the issuer. Mutual Funds and Index Funds \nWhile mutual funds cannot invest directly in commodities, they can invest in stocks of companies involved in commodity-related industries, such as energy, agriculture or mining. Like the stocks they invest in, the fund shares may be affected by factors other than commodity prices, including stock market fluctuations and company-specific risks. \nA small number of commodity index mutual funds invest in futures contracts and commodity-linked derivative investments, thus providing more direct exposure to commodity prices. \nAdvantages:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T13:26:20.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
