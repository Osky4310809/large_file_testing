Mata and Fellaini hand United first-leg advantage over Hull \n“I always think we are responsible for the way the fans participate in our games. It is our responsibility. It you play very well and enthusiastically, the fans come to the pitch and play with us. When we don’t play with emotion or intensity, then they don’t. \n“We have amazing fans and I can only say good things about them; they were supporting us when things were not good earlier in the season but Sunday is a special match for us. My invitation to Manchester United fans is: ‘don’t come to the theatre, come and play with us.’” \nMourinho confessed that much of United’s play, especially in the first half, had been far too slow. “It complicates things,” he said. “There was always one more touch or one more second to delay the decision and we lost some very important chances.” \nAlthough Manchester United lost their last League Cup semi-final, when David Moyes’s side somehow failed to overcome Sunderland, the two players signed by Moyes – Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini - combined to score the goals that, barring an extraordinary turnaround in the second leg on Humberside, should see them through to Wembley. \nFor Mata it was another fine performance in an outstanding season. However, when Fellaini scored what should prove to be the decisive second goal, he ran over to embrace his manager. During Manchester United’s 1-0 win over Tottenham last month, Fellaini was jeered as he warmed up.

He played phenomenally in the FA Cup against Reading and he has changed the dynamic with the fans.” \nMourinho said that Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who missed the semi-final with illness, should be fit to face Liverpool but said he doubted Marcos Rojo would be fit enough for the game. He also expressed his regret that Morgan Schneiderlin was leaving the club to join Everton for a £22m fee. \n“I am sad and happy because he could have been an option for us in midfield,” he said. “But this is what he wants to do – he wants to play – and he has been a very good professional.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:18:29.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
