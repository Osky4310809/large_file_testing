Hampi, Karnataka \nOne of India's top historical destinations , the laid back village of Hampi was once the last capital of Vijayanagar, one of the greatest Hindu empires in India's history. It has some extremely captivating ruins, intriguingly intermingled with large boulders that rear up all over the landscape. The ruins, which date back to the 14th century, stretch for just over 25 kilometers (10 miles) and comprise more than 500 monuments. An incredible energy can be felt at this ancient place. Hampi is commonly visited from Goa, as there are a number of transport options from there. More Â» \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Tips to Make Coach Feel Like First Class Badami, Karnataka.

They're rich in monuments, temples and ruins from the Chalukya empire, which ruled there between the 4th to 8th centuries. The renowned Chalukya style of architecture originated in Aihole and the village is filled with around 125 stone temples, which unfortunately don't get the attention they deserve. Badami is one of the top places to see caves in India, with four sets of magnificent ancient rock-cut cave temples. Pattadakal is smaller, with one impressive temple complex.

Kerala Backwaters \nCruising along the palm-fringed Kerala canals, known as the backwaters, is a quintessential experience during which time truly seems to stand still. Indian food cooked by a chef and chilled beer on board the boat make it even more enjoyable. You can spend the night on the boat, out in the middle of the water, surrounded by serenity. Bliss! And while you're in the area, why not stay a night or two at a resort or homestay on the backwaters?
