When the bill is passed, we will go a step further on the criminality of some hoodlums. We are on top of the situation. \n“I inherited a state where everything is comatose; criminality was on its peak but with the steps we have taken, you all are witness to the fact that crime in the state has been reduced to barest minimum. \n“But as a leader with fear of God I will continue to pray for him, let God help him to succeed, I leave him with his conscience.” \nAbout 52 persons, including women and children, were on Monday shot dead, with several other people sustaining various degrees of injury, after gunmen invaded Zaki Biam, in Ukum Local Government Area of Benue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T20:17:33.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
