It also nullifies a ruling handed down by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals opposing the order. \nWhat the new order will do: \n-Temporarily ban refugees from the same previously selected countries of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya. The selection of these countries comes from an Obama administration recommendation. \n-Allow green card holders from the seven selected countries to travel in and out of the United States \n-Those in transit on visas at the time when the new order is signed will not be detained at the airport and sent home \n-Refugees citing religious persecution, such as Christians under genocide in the countries listed, will not receive special consideration \nHow is it different than his first executive order ? \n-The first executive order issued in January did not exempt green card holders from being barred entry in to the U.S. \n-The first executive order allowed refugees being persecuted on the basis of religious to receive special consideration for entry \nThe new executive order is expected by the end of the week. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday the administration is confident the new executive order will pass legal muster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:57:38.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
