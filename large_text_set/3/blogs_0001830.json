In an appearance on Fox Sports One’s Undefeated with Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe on Wednesday, the former forward said his ex-coach is up to his old tricks again.\n“He went to go get the Rasheed Wallace , like the Spencer Hawes and the [Mo Speights],” he said. “ J.J. Redick comes off all the screens, that’s a Ray Allen. He went to go get an old Paul Pierce . Paul Pierce is great, but he’s not the same Paul Pierce. \n“He’s fishing for things that he once had, but at the same time he’s with another team. So being a coach, you have to adjust. You have to see, ‘Hey, you know what? I don’t have a KG on my team, so this is what I need to do to be a better coach.’ “\n\"[Doc Rivers] is so caught up in being the President... you need to be the coach.\" — Glen Davis ( @iambigbaby11 ) pic.twitter.com/nyfpszVPJy \n— UNDISPUTED (@undisputed) March 1, 2017 Davis, who spent four-plus seasons under Rivers with both the Clippers and the Boston Celtics , lit into the Los Angeles president, claiming he has fallen short of his coaching duties with his dual role in the front office. \n“I think he’s so caught up in being the president that hey, you need to be the coach,” Davis said. “Danny Ainge was the president, and he got everything done the way it was supposed to be done. He didn’t need to worry about that. Coach the game like you know how to coach.”\nDavis’ follow-up jab comes just weeks after he took a dig at his ex-coach in mid-February on Chris Broussard’s “In the Zone” podcast, where he called the Rivers “overrated” as a head coach and “lucky as hell” to win a championship in Boston.\nThe discussion begins at the 20:45 mark:\n\"Because what Doc had in '08 was special,\" Davis said on the podcast. \"And he was lucky as hell. Lucky as hell. The year before that they were wearing trash bags (in the crowd). ... But then the next year they win it, now he's one of the best coaches ever? I'm just not feeling that, you know what I mean?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T21:23:52.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
