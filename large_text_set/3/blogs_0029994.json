Harder to discern is how firms are doing on the inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. LGBT employees do not necessarily make their sexual orientation known in the workplace, and thus are sometimes considered an “invisible” minority.\nIn the U.S. and Europe, approximately 20% of LGB employees experience discrimination at work . Transgender employees typically report higher rates of discrimination, perhaps because they are more visibly gender nonconforming. In a 2014 study by an advocacy group, a majority of LGBT employees reported  that they had overheard jokes about gay or lesbian people, and one-third said they felt compelled to lie about their personal life in the workplace.\nTo better understand the causes and consequences of homophobia in the workplace, we conducted a study of gay and lesbian auditors in the Big Five audit firms in France. The challenge of tackling LGBT inclusion is particularly crucial in professional service firms, in which work interactions are key to the functioning of the organization. We chose to focus on audit firms for two reasons. One is what sociologists call the predominance of men: The Big Five firms in France employ roughly 50% women overall, but this proportion shrinks to 20% at the partner level. The second is that there are clearly agreed-upon norms about what auditing entails: ensuring a firm’s activity follows accounting rules and is meeting social and financial expectations. This focus on norms influences the perception of behaviors and gender within the firm. In other words, auditors are expected to follow norms themselves as they ensure that norms are followed by the firms they audit.\nWe conducted in-depth interviews with 18 gay and lesbian auditors, and followed up with them over the course of two years. Our data was collected at a time when the French government was passing a gay marriage law that had polarized public opinion and triggered months of protests. Our study unveiled subtle forms of homophobia and the identity struggles experienced by gay and lesbian auditors.\nHow Homophobia Can Be Commonplace at Work The good news is that our study revealed no obvious discrimination against the 18 gay and lesbian employees. The bad news is that almost all of them reported hearing a number of comments or jokes aimed at sexual minorities in the work context. Previous psychology research has shown that in comparison to workers who are not out, employees who are open about their sexuality tend to experience higher job satisfaction and better relationships with their managers. Most of the auditors we studied kept their sexual identity hidden from their coworkers. They felt that doing so could prevent them from suffering overt discrimination, but could also allow their colleagues to assume that using homophobic slurs is “harmless.”\nOur subjects were reluctant to reveal their sexual identity for fear of being judged. Auditors are regularly rated by their peers and managers, so being harshly judged by colleagues could have negative career consequences. Beyond the prospect of being the subject of overt discrimination, LGBT employees were afraid of losing control of information about their sexual identity, by being talked about by colleagues, for example, or being the object of office rumors.\nTo hide their sexuality, gay and lesbian auditors lied constantly about their personal life while at work. Since they worked long hours, they spent a significant share of their time concealing part of their identity and feeling insecure during personal discussions. Something as mundane as a discussion about dinner plans for Valentine’s Day can be difficult for employees who are not out. Should they tell the truth? Should they lie by omission? Or should they plainly and simply lie about it? Each option is risky. More generally, gay and lesbian auditors reported a constant social discomfort, as they needed to repeatedly decide whether to disclose or to conceal their sexual identity, and in the latter case, decide how to conceal it.\nWhy the Rhetoric of Corporate Performance Can Be Damaging We observed that the rhetoric of performance in the workplace is consistently associated with virility and heteronormative masculine values. This has been noted by researchers in a variety of professional service firms, such as investment banking , consulting , and auditing . Because homosexuality is prejudicially thought to diverge from those values, it is considered at odds with performance. Several of our respondents reported their discomfort when they heard their manager or colleagues shout “This is not some faggot’s audit!” (“C’est pas un audit de PD!”) as a way to signal the importance and significance of the mission and to encourage strength and combativeness among team members . \nBecause of this association between performance and virility, some employees engaged in extreme demonstrations of their masculinity when they felt it was threatened, and to reassert their commitment to achievement at work. For example, they made overtly sexist comments, demeaning the behavior of other male colleagues as “effeminate.”\nMaking Professional Service Firms More Welcoming to LGBT Staff To fix the problem of workplace homophobia, managers should be on the lookout for toxic performance rhetoric, and they should certainly stop using such rhetoric themselves.\nMentoring, while an imperfect solution to diversity issues, can play a role. We observed that in the global firms’ UK offices, just on the other side of the Channel, there were more active networks for mentoring LGBT employees. The challenge for such schemes is to actually find LGBT employees who are out at the most senior level to act as mentors.\nMentors can help junior employees navigate the implications of disclosing or concealing their identity and help them obtain organizational support. For example, one of our respondents who was being sent abroad for a work assignment explained how the firm supported his partner in his job search. Being part of a network of employees based on this invisible attribute is also a way to reveal one’s sexual identity in a dispassionate way.\nMuch remains to be done for professional service firms to address the challenges of invisible minorities. Rethinking those firms’ culture should be first on the agenda.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:47:27.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
