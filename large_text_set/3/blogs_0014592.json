This fellow Bhagat, he does not look strong and muscular”, lawyer Vikram Varma said. \n“I doubt he had the strength to overcome Danielle on his own. If she was intoxicated there would have been no need for the terrible injuries she suffered”, he added. media_camera British backpacker Danielle McLaughlin (left) was brutally raped and murdered in Goa.

He will face rape and murder charges later. \nMeanwhile, a man who was seen with Ms McLaughlin in haunting final pictures has denied having any role in her killing. \nThe last known pictures of the much-loved jetsetter show her in a bikini top and holding the hand of Rajesh Sarokomart Pant — a local taxi driver known as ‘Kanar’. \nThe 37-year-old reportedly spent hours drinking with Ms McLaughlin, who lived and worked in Liverpool before going travelling, but denies he was holding her hand. \nHe is one of six men brought in for questioning by police investigating her murder and has since been released on bail. \nHe said he had been drinking with the traveller in Green Park bar on the night of her death. media_camera British backpacker Danielle McLaughin was gang raped before being slashed to death, according to her family’s lawyer.

We call the crime scene experts and forensics. \n“But in this case it might have taken a couple of hours for the team to turn up. \n“The accused was identified by some witnesses, but it was done with due diligence.” \nPolice revealed Ms McLaughlin was strangled and slashed to death after she was raped. \nHer body was discovered naked in a field near a beach after her face was mutilated with a broken beer bottle. \nA post-mortem revealed evidence of sexual assault and “compression of the neck”, local media said. \nUmesh Gaonkar, of Goa Police, said the examination showed that Ms McLaughlin suffered cerebral damage as well as constriction of the neck, causing her death. media_camera Explosive claims cast doubt on the police operation in Goa, India.
