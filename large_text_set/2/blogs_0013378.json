News of David's death is described as a blow to the whole hometown back in Ireland \n“I would have known the chaps. They are a very big family. \n\"Hard working people, Johnners is a self-employed builder, all of those chaps worked with their father from the ages of 12, 13, 14,” said Cllr Mythen. \nHe added: “They would have been roofing, carrying slates up rooves… nothing came easy to that family they had to work very hard for everything. They could turn their hands to anything. They’d be gifted that way.” \nHe described his death as “a parent’s worst nightmare”. \n“How they’re going to get there I don’t know. They’ll have so much to try and arrange to get the body home. It’s an awful situation,” he said. \nJunior minister Paul Kehoe, who lives just outside Enniscorthy, said: \"I already spoke to Charlie Flanagan last night as I had heard it was somebody from Wexfod and I'll be speaking to him again.\" David Walsh was a father of three who emigrated to Australia (Photo: Facebook) \nHe added: \"This is very sad and tragic. For it to happen so far away makes it even more difficult for the family. I offer my sympathies and condolences.\" \nA friend posted on social media: \"Absolutely heart broken an thats putting it mildly cant believe it cant get me head around it at all, just waiting wake up an it be all a bad dream so so many good memories.\" \nNew South Wales Police said: \"Police from Bankstown Local Area Command established a crime scene and arrested a 25-year-old woman, who is known to the dead man. \n\"A 36-year-old Revesby man was also arrested and both were taken to Bankstown Police Station. \n\"Bankstown detectives are being assisted by officers from the State Crime Command’s Homicide Squad. \n\"Later this afternoon, the woman, who is an Irish National, was charged with murder. \n\"She has been refused bail and will appear in Parramatta Local Court tomorrow (Sunday 19 February 2017). \n\"The Revesby man continues to assist police with their inquiries. \n\"NSWPF is working with the Irish Consulate in Sydney.\" \nA spokesperson for the Department of foreign affairs said they are providing consular assistance for the family.
