And you have a right to be exactly who you are. But I also want to be very clear: This right isn’t just handed to you. No, this right has to be earned every single day. You cannot take your freedoms for granted. Just like generations who have come before you, you have to do your part to preserve and protect those freedoms. And that starts right now, when you’re young.” If you’re not sobbing yet, just watch the full speech below. And be sure to keep a box of tissues handy — because it’s a doozy.\nWhile this event at the White House marked her last official speech as First Lady, Michelle will appear on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on January 11th. So tune in then to get one more dose of one of the greatest First Ladies our nation has ever known.\n*Sob sob*\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:10:44.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
