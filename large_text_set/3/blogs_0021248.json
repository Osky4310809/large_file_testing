The 47-year-old musician posted video of himself in handcuffs on Instagram, telling police that he's a recording artist, and for someone to give officers the address to the recording studio he was coming home from. He also says he's going to sue the LAPD. \"Y'all see the police have handcuffs on me,\" he says in the video. \"They just took off my Haitian bandanna. That's what's going on right now with Wyclef in L.A. right now. The LAPD have me in cuffs for absolutely nothing.\" A post shared by Wyclef Jean (@wyclefjean) on Mar 21, 2017 at 4:52am PDT A post shared by Wyclef Jean (@wyclefjean) on Mar 21, 2017 at 6:23am PDT A Los Angeles Sheriff's Department spokesperson confirmed to ET on Tuesday that Jean was detained in West Hollywood, California, at around 12:40 a.m. \"The victim that was robbed gave a description of a vehicle and a suspect which matched the vehicle that he [Jean] was a passenger in, and the suspect’s description matched his description, that's why he was detained,\" the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said the \"Gone Till November\" singer was detained for approximately 10 minutes before being released. \"When we detained him, the officers were speaking to the handling unit that was still with the victim and were able to ask some clarifying questions, and hear some details to determine based on their investigation in the field that he was not the suspect, so they continued on with the investigation,\" the spokesperson said. The Sheriff's Department added that they found the actual suspect vehicle four blocks away \"that once again matched [Jean's] vehicle description and the actual suspect which matched [Jean's] description.” Jean tweeted about the incident, and said that he was \"treated like a criminal.\" \"I was asked by the police to put my hands up,\" be wrote. \"Then I was told do not move. I was instantly handcuffed before being asked to identify myself. Nor was I told why I was being cuffed. In the process I said my name and told them they have wrong person.\" \"They proceeded to ignore me and I was treated like a criminal until other police showed up and pointed out they had wrong person,\" he continued. \"I am sure no father wants his sons or daughters to see him in handcuffs especially if he is innocent. As some one who has law enforcers in my family, I was appalled by this behavior of the LAPD.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:40:23.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
