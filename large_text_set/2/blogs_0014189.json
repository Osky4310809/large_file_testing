Even with a month-and-a-half to go until the biggest show of the year, there are a number of matches rumored to be on the card, and some will end up cemented in place soon. Of course, things could always change, but let’s see what is possibly going to happen on that incredible night. \nAs of this writing, there is only one match confirmed and in place to happen at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando. That one has been set for a few weeks now and it will see Brock Lesnar and Goldberg in a third and final match to determine who is the better beast of the two. \nInquisitr recently reported that this match could end up being for the WWE Universal Championship currently held by Kevin Owens. Goldberg is facing him at Fastlane and it is rumored that he will be taking the title away from KO to defend against Lesnar. [Image by WWE] \nNow, the only other confirmed item for WrestleMania 33 is the fact that Bray Wyatt will defend the WWE Championship against someone. Randy Orton said he would not fight Wyatt even though he won that right in the Royal Rumble , but then, who does that leave as Bray’s opponent? \nA huge battle royal is scheduled for this week’s SmackDown Live and it is set to determine a new number one contender, but it may not be that simple. Sports Keeda reports that WWE is considering a triple threat match for the title with Luke Harper winning the battle royal and Orton wanting to rejoin the match. \nCageside Seats is reporting that WWE is still moving forward with the idea that Seth Rollins will be healthy enough to take part in WrestleMania 33 . If he is, he will face Triple H as has been the plan for months, but if not, the company is working on a backup plan for the match with “The Game.” \nA lot of the wheels were set in motion at the Elimination Chamber , and Forbes reports that the plan is still for a mixed tag match of John Cena and Nikki Bella vs. The Miz and Maryse. If they go through with this bout, it will likely do a lot for Total Divas . [Image by WWE] \nEverything was laid in place last year at WrestleMania 32 , and The Sun reports that Big Show vs. Shaquille O’Neal is still in the plans for this year. The two have been taunting one another on social media and Big Show looks to be the better shape than ever, and Shaq is ready to have his first-ever match. \nThis past week on Monday Night Raw , Chris Jericho and Kevin Owens saw their best friend relationship break up for good. Bleacher Report thinks that feud will be one of the hottest things over the next month and that their match at WrestleMania must be for the Universal Title. \nRumored matches for WrestleMania 33 : WWE Championship: Bray Wyatt (c) vs. Randy Orton vs. Luke Harper John Cena & Nikki Bella vs. The Miz & Maryse Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal Fatal 4-Way for Raw Women’s Championship : Charlotte Flair vs. Bayley vs. Nia Jax vs. Sasha Banks Naomi & Becky Lynch vs. Mickie James & Alexa Bliss Big Show vs. Shaq", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:22:08.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
