I think the idea of community is being questioned, maybe even threatened, and all soaps are about community.\n\n‘EastEnders is not realistic, it’s always been a fantasy, a fiction of what community is but in that fantasy or fiction there is a deeper truth, and it’s to do with the robustness of the format.’\nHe also touched upon the much talked about deaths of Ronnie and Roxy Mitchell earlier this year, in an episode that saw the doomed sisters drown together after Ronnie married Jack Branning.\nHe said: ‘They were not the sort of characters that would leave in the back of a taxi – we wanted to give them an operatic ending.’\n(Picture: BBC) Another huge talking point recently has been the re-cast of Michelle Fowler. Sean is pleased with how the return of the massive character is going, adding that new star Jenna Russell has the ‘full seal of approval’ from her predecessor Susan Tully.\nHe shared: ‘She is one of the iconic, original characters of the show. We had the choice that we never investigate that rich, fertile character again or we get someone else to do it and that’s exactly what we’ve done.’\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: A family is torn apart by an unexpected event that changes life forever \nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Huge week revealed as Michelle Fowler’s affair sparks explosive disaster ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:11:58.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
