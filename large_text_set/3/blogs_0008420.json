Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen hit the barriers and crashed on day two of the second Formula 1 pre-season test in Barcelona \nBut the Scuderia's hitherto-serene progress in pre-season running hit the barriers midway through the afternoon when Raikkonen spun at the high-speed Turn Three and crashed into barriers. Although Raikkonen was unhurt in the crash, the damage inflicted to the car meant he was unable to return to action. \nVerstappen's participation was also compromised, first by an engine change for the RB13 and then a late stoppage on track. However, Red Bull's day proved positive overall and they reached 100 laps in one day for the first time in 2017. \n\"We had a similar issue as this morning, but they are on top of it now and they should have solutions in place for the future,\" Verstappen told Sky F1 . \"So it should be alright.\" \nIt was the second day in a row that the new Renault power unit has had to be changed after the works outfit made what was termed a 'precautionary' switch on Tuesday. \nMeanwhile, McLaren's Fernando Alonso completed just 46 laps - the fewest of any driver in a car for the entire day - and finished a distant 12th in the timesheets. The team denied, however, that it had been forced into another engine change despite Alonso being inactive for over four hours at one stage. \nAre Williams 2017's dark horse? After Massa headed the timesheets on Tuesday, the Brazilian all-but repeated the trick with a lap of 1:19.420 which was three-tenths up on his Day Two best. \nOn this occasion, Massa was running on the ultrasoft compound, the fastest compound in the Pirelli portfolio. But after also running on the purple-coloured tyre, Bottas in the Mercedes was unable to extract any more lap time out of the ultrasofts than he had produced on the supersofts with his test-best lap of 1:19.310. \nMassa's lap was therefore the fastest any car has produced on ultrasofts and there was further encouragement in the afternoon running when, after Massa had handed over the car to his rookie team-mate, Lance Stroll went fifth fastest ahead of Hamilton.
