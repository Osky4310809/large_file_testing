The site’s removal may draw alarm to the millions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens who might feel concerned about losing some of the protection granted to them under the Obama administration. \nPreviously, whitehouse.gov/lgbt provided information about legislative LBGT progress over the past eight years.
