It’s reliable. It might cloud up, but we know it’s there.”\nThe positive qualities we associate with the hue , like dependability, constancy, and loyalty, might point to why we’ve traditionally assigned the color to boys. We want them to embody these values as they become men.\nGive the color to girls, especially iconic role models, and they’ll get to embody those values, too. Walt Disney Co. “You’re adding a bit of power to the character by giving her the blue,” Eiseman says. “It’s a very subtle way of saying, ‘Yeah, but young women, young girls, can be empowered, too.’” The blue dress Belle wears at the beginning of the Disney tale serves as a symbol of her transition from her sheltered girl’s reality to her expanding experience as a woman.\nAlice, tumbling down the rabbit hole in a blue dress, returns home with a grander world view. The same is true of Dorothy, returning home from Oz. Walt Disney Co. Or, take Cinderella’s transition from her homemade pink dress to her crystal blue ball gown: the symbolism is strong. \nvia GIPHY \n“There is a sort of refinement and crispness to light blue, but there’s also blue in workwear,” Eiseman explains. “It is a practical color, and a color that you can work in. In that sense, it is full of active strength.”\nActive strength: There’s a quality we want to instill in all girls .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T17:20:42.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
