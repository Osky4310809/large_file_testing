It didn’t.\nTo thousands of people watching a television broadcast of the Rockets and the Hawks , it looked like Trevor Ariza had just tied the game with a three. See for yourself! Down three in the final minute, Ariza swishes this shot, doesn’t he?\nWell, no, despite what several fans think in the background. Here’s another angle that shows it wasn’t close.\nIt’s the optics of the swishing net. The ball ends up exactly where the ball would end up on a swished made shot, and from angle of the television camera, your eye assumes that’s what happened. It briefly stunned the players on the court, too — Kent Bazemore held the ball for a couple seconds after the rebound before Rockets players realized they needed to foul him.\nThat totally looks like it could be a ball swishing through the hoop. Unfortunately, it wasn’t, and the Tim Hardaway Jr. explosion in the fourth quarter for 23 points meant Houston lost in embarrassing fashion. \nWhat’s funny is this isn’t even the first time it has happened to Ariza, who once shot a potential game winner that tricked both television announcers into calling it like it was a game-winner.\nLike this one, it was an airball that hit the net just right. It slowly dawned on the announcers that the shot hadn’t gone in, leading to a sheepish explanation that Ariza hadn’t actually hit it. On the replays, it looks so obvious. But from those first angles, it’s a totally different story.\nTrevor Ariza has made 1,086 threes in his career. If you asked a television camera, just know they might say 1,088, not knowing any better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:00:26.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
