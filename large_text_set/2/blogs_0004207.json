Peter Roskam’s office to discuss Obamacare with the Congressman. But when a staffer learned a reporter was present, the meeting was canceled. Katherine Skiba and Marwa Eltagouri reported : \n“I am flabbergasted that Peter Roskam and his staff would turn us away,” Sandra Alexander, who organized the meeting, said . “They didn’t have the courtesy to listen to us. We are a peaceful group.” [...] \nA Facebook group called \"6th District of Illinois-Holding Peter Roskam Accountable\" has sprung up to urge calls to Roskam. \nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is taking the unusual move of targeting Roskam, an unusual move for a representative serving a persistently Republican district. And the DSCC is not the only opposition. By Friday, 80 or 90 people had signed up to attend the Palatine Township Republican Organization's monthly meeting where Roskam was scheduled to speak and expected protesters. And were there ever. As you can see in the video below, there were hundreds. x \n\"You can't hide anymore\": Constituents line up to protest Rep.

The townhall meeting set up in a local theater by Republican Rep. Tom McClintock in Roseville, California, drew a huge crowd inside and out. Angela Hart reports : \nFacing a packed auditorium and raucous crowd, Republican Congressman Tom McClintock on Saturday defended his party’s national agenda and voiced strong support for President Donald Trump’s disputed executive actions to scale back Obamacare, ban refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. \n“Vote him out,” hundreds of demonstrators chanted outside the Tower Theatre in downtown Roseville, the Republican-heavy population center of McClintock’s sprawling congressional district. Inside the theater, more than than 200 people gathered for a town-hall event hosted by McClintock. \nAttendees, carrying signs that read “Resist,” “Dump Tom McTrump,” and “Climate change is real,” repeatedly pressed McClintock to denounce Republican plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, acknowledge the science supporting the human causes of climate change, and oppose Trump’s executive order temporarily banning refugee admissions to the U.S. x \nThe line to get into the @RepMcClintock town hall goes around the block and then around another block. pic.twitter.com/SRiRNmfuXW — McClintock disliker (@MaryHartmanx2) February 4, 2017 x — Katie Orr (@1KatieOrr) February 4, 2017 \nMeanwhile, in at least four cities of West Virginia, protesters showed up in at least four cities to oppose Sen. Shelley Moore Capito’s support for Betty DeVos, Pr*sident Trump’s choice   U.S. Department of Education. x \nPeople are gathering outside @SenCapito 's offices across WV today to convince her to change her vote.

Cory Gardner’s office to protest his support for DeVos. \nGardner has riled people with claims that people who are emailing and calling his office urging him not to vote for DeVos are “paid protesters.” x \n. @SenAndyKerr took a trip to @SenCoryGardner 's #Colorado office today to tell him loud & clear- protect #education , vote NO on #BetsyDeVos pic.twitter.com/g4AxixUeQ8 — SiX Action (@SiXActionNews) February 4, 2017 \nAnd in Janesville, Wisconsin, hometown of House Speaker Paul Ryan, to challenge for his stance favoring draconian immigration laws and the proposed wall on the Mexican border.
