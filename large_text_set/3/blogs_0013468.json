Sinha, an upper caste Bhumihar, has considerable administrative experience. 57-year-old Sinha an MP from Ghazipur in Poorvanchal. With an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP is making sure the Chief Minister that it selects must please every sections. With speculation rife over the BJP’s chief ministerial pick for Uttar Pradesh, party chief Amit Shah yesterday had left everyone guessing with his remark that he has given the responsibility of choosing the CM to state unit chief Keshav Prasad Maurya. \nEarlier, Sinha had ruled out himself out for the post. “I am not in the race,” he had said at an election rally. \nWatch this video \nMaurya, who is himself seen as one of the probables, then told reporters that how can he choose himself, when asked if he is a contender for the post.
