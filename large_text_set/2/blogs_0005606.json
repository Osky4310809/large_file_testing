Just two of the times I have seen someone run this script.) \nDo you get the joke? They’re anxiously waiting because you haven’t replied quickly enough. \nOf course, this is intended to be light-hearted. The idea is to get a laugh, and for that laugh to inspire you to click “Reply”. They don’t mean anything else by it. \nAnd I totally believe that. They also don’t mean to prove to you that they are an entitled fucking asshole who was raised by wolves (read: narcissistic parents). But they did. They definitely proved that. \nImagine the mindset of someone who thinks this is a good idea: You’ve just made a request of someone you don’t know. Your request isn’t time sensitive, and you know the person you’ve just emailed is probably very busy, but 24 hours have passed without a response, and now you’re hoping really, really bad that this person will do something for you. So, of course, you figure it only makes sense to email them again—to “ping” them, in the obnoxious, literally anti-personal language of modern entrepreneurialism. And though you may deny it, the message you compose, reads: “Hey You! Stranger! I’m waiting over here. Give me what I want now!” \nPeople actually do this. Even many who would pull back at sending a finger-tapping GIF, wouldn’t hesitate 17 hours after their first email, to follow up. “Hey, did you get my email?” “Hey, what’s going on?” “Hey, when are you going to give me an answer?” \nIt’s unfathomable to me. When I see it, all I think is: I’m sorry, am I inconveniencing you by not promptly responding to the email I never wanted to receive in the first place? By god man, do you think the world revolves around you? \nThe said reality is we don’t have to “imagine” someone acting this way. Because it happens every day. \nThere are fundamentally two types of people in this world: 1) People who think they are entitled to other people’s time and 2) decent, civilized human beings. The latter are those who respect time (because they understand that time is finite). The former ask indiscriminately to chat or meet . The latter are straight and to the point and aim to conduct their business with as little imposition on other people as possible. The former are the ones who always seem to want to “hop on the phone” or make some other request without any consideration of other people or why someone might want to do that. They are the people who are always taking, taking and taking. Because the latter wouldn’t conceive of stealing someone else’s time, they are often the marks that the former attempt to exploit. They are prey to the trickery (like I’ve discussed above) and laziness of the former. Like the folks who send audio-texts instead of bothering to write out an email or god-forbid a few sentence text. \nAll of these modern practices probably began with some selfish person who didn’t stop to consider the person on the other end of the exchange. That’s their right, just as it’s the right of the person who receives their GIF-y email to shake their head and write them off as rude and ridiculous . \nThankfully, that’s what 99% of the people who encounter these tactics do. The problem is that the other 1% see them and think: “Oh my god, that’s brilliant! I should totally do that too.” And so like a cancer, this selfish, entitled way of interacting spreads through our culture, infecting and spoiling idiots who don’t understand decorum or manners or basic human decency. \nAnd it’s been this way since the beginning of civilization, since long before the invention of the telephone or email. Two thousand years ago, Seneca observed how interesting it is that if your neighbor came over and asked for a piece of your property you’d think they were insane. But if someone asks you for five minutes, you go “Sure!”. “ No person hands out their money to passers-by,” he said , “but to how many do each of us hand out our lives! We’re tight-fisted with property and money, yet think too little of wasting time, the one thing about which we should all be the toughest misers.” \nTo apply that to this new kind of email parasitism, it’s not just that they expect a piece of your property—they expect it on their timeline. And if you don’t hand it over quickly enough, what you get in return is a guilt trip. It’s passive aggression at its worst. Cookie Monster, with his insatiable, unstoppable appetite for cookies is such an apt image for this. Because like him, these people are never satisfied and want more and more and more. \nSince what they want is important to them, it’s the most important thing in the world. \nThis kind of explicit selfishness is repulsive, but it’s also refreshing. Like a lot of people, I feel bad if I am slow to respond to something and I feel rude when I say no . That’s because I do consider the person on the other side of the exchange (for starters, I realize that there is a person on the other side of the exchange—not an ATM) and I put myself in their shoes and think about how I’d like to be treated. \nWhen someone goes and proves that they are operating on an entirely differently level—that all they care about is themselves, that they can’t even be polite when asking you to fork over minutes of your life you’ll never get back—it makes responding very easy. As I told the last kid who sent me that email, I’m actually grateful. \nThanks, I said, you’ve made this very easy for me. No, no, no—a thousand times no. Don’t email me ever again.
