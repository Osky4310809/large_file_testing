However, it still took 19 fire engines and 110 firemen to control the situation, according to the South China Morning Post .\nSEE ALSO: Everything we think we know about the Samsung Galaxy S8\nThe Note7 was recalled twice and permanently discontinued after replacement phones with \"safe\" batteries produced by another supplier, China's Amperex Technology Ltd, also started exploding.\nmore picture about Samsung SDI in tianjin is on fire… pic.twitter.com/Ui6J4mGwSj\n— 萌萌的电教 (@mmddj_china) February 8, 2017\nLocal firefighters told the SCMP \"lithium-ion batteries and some semi-manufactured battery products\" were amongst the materials that caught on fire.\nAfter months of investigation, Samsung announced last month it finally knew what caused the Note7 to explode. The Korean electronics giant blamed the phone's explosions on two issues: batteries, made by Samsung SDI, that were slightly too big to fit into the Note7's slim body and manufacturing problems for batteries supplied by Amperex, related to \"abnormal weld spots\" and missing insulation tape that caused internal circuits to short circuit.\nTo reassure consumers and quell fears of future phone batteries exploding, Samsung will implement an 8-point battery safety check involving more extreme testing, X-ray inspection and more human reviews.\nBONUS: 5 awesome Android phones to replace your Galaxy Note7", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mmddj_china/status/829191051021844481", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/BztWrBtQ.m3u8", "https://t.co/Ui6J4mGwSj", "http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/8-point-battery-check/", "http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2069166/fire-breaks-out-chinese-factory-makes-samsung-note-7-batteries", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/samsung-sdi-puts-out-minor-fire-at-tianjin-battery-factory", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/BztWrBtQ.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-09T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T19:01:32.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
