Next month, the popular streaming site will release Marvel’s Iron Fist to the public, leaving fans to become acquainted with Danny Rand and his mystical martial arts. The comic book icon will be joining the likes of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones with his own standalone series. And, now, Daredevil is teasing fans with a fun Iron Fist easter egg over on Twitter. \nIf you check out the Twitter page for Daredevil , you will see the account shared what appears to be an unassuming image of a newspaper article. “Look closely, you never know what you’ll see,” the photo’s caption reads. So, naturally, fans began searching the page for easter eggs to great success. \nIn the bottom-left corner of the spread, fans can see a headline which reads, “New Theories Shed Light on Lost City.” Comic book readers should quickly connect the phrase to Marvel’s Iron Fist series. In the comics, the mysterious city of K’un L’un is often referred to as the Lost City since it only appears on Earth once every ten years. The city is where Rand trained after a tragic accident left him parentless and isolated away from humanity. And, apparently, the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe is aware of its existence. \nThe clever find is connected to Daredevil because of the newspaper itself. The article is published in the fictional New York Bulletin, a publication which Ben Ulrich wrote for before he was murdered by the Kingpin in Daredevil Season One. Next to the smaller article, fans can also see that the Punisher is mentioned. A massive headline reading “Punisher Punished: Ruthless Vigilante Captured” can be seen written. \nYou can check out the full synopsis for Iron Fist below: \nFifteen years after being presumed dead in a plane crash, Danny Rand (Finn Jones) mysteriously returns to New York City determined to reclaim his birthright and family company. However, when a long-destined enemy rises in New York, this living weapon is forced to choose between his family’s legacy and his duties as the Iron Fist. \nMarvel’s Iron Fist was developed by Scott Buck. The Netflix series stars Finn Jones as Danny Rand, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. The cast also includes Jessica Henwick, David Wenham, Jessica Stroup, Tom Pelphrey, and Rosario Dawson. \nLook closely, you never know what you'll see. #Daredevil pic.twitter.com/mGMokcdFIB — Daredevil (@Daredevil) February 16, 2017 \nIron Fist was created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane for Marvel Comics. Iron Fist made his first appearance in Marvel Premiere #15 in 1974. Though he has headlined his own series, he is best known for being Luke Cage's partner in the Heroes for Hire. \nMarvel's Iron Fist premieres March 17, 2017 exclusively on Netflix.
