The Malaysian police have arrested two women, who are accused of smearing Mr. Kim’s face with the nerve agent VX . Malaysia said the women were recruited by several North Korean suspects. North Korea has repeatedly denied involvement. On Tuesday, it said it was barring all Malaysians from leaving the country until there was a “fair settlement” of the dispute. Malaysia responded in kind, preventing all North Koreans from leaving Malaysia until the safety of Malaysians in North Korea could be assured. Shortly after Mr. Kim was killed, South Korean intelligence officials said they believed that his family, which has lived in Macau in recent years, was under Chinese government protection. But Kim Han-sol did not show up in Kuala Lumpur after the Malaysian authorities looked for the next of kin to formally identify his father’s body. \nAdvertisement The video was posted by a group called Cheollima Civil Defense, which said it focused on rescuing North Korean defectors and refugees. A video in which a man identified himself as the son of Kim Jong-nam. Cheollima Civil Defense On its website , the group said it had responded last month to “an emergency request by survivors of the family of Kim Jong-nam for extraction and protection.” \nAdvertisement “The three family members were met quickly and relocated to safety,” the group said. “This will be the first and last statement on this particular matter, and the present whereabouts of this family will not be addressed.” Both Mr. Jeong and Mr. Do said they had never previously heard of the group. “This video means that Kim Han-sol’s family is in safety and working together with this group, whoever they are, to attack the North Korean government,” said Mr. Do, an activist who has rescued North Korean refugees for years. \n  The group thanked the countries that it said provided “emergency humanitarian assistance” in its efforts to protect the Kim family: China, the Netherlands, the United States and another nation it did not name. In particular, it thanked A.J.A. Embrechts, the Dutch ambassador to South Korea, “for his timely and strong response to our sudden request for assistance.” \n  The Dutch Embassy did not immediately comment. The United States Embassy also did not comment. Kim Han-sol was born in Pyongyang in 1995 but has spent most of his life abroad, living with his father in Macau, the Chinese gambling enclave, and attending schools in Bosnia and France. \n  Speaking to a European broadcaster in 2012, Kim Han-sol said he had never met his uncle Kim Jong-un , the current leader of North Korea, or his grandfather Kim Jong-il, who ruled the North until he died in 2011. In the same interview , he said he did not know how his uncle became a “dictator.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
