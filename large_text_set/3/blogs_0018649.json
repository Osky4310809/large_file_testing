They decided to make use of the beach town’s earth-friendly recycled water program —and came away from the experiment with surprisingly positive results.\n“Among the pale ales that I’ve made, it’s probably in the top three,” Senior Manager of Brewing and Innovation Steve Gonzalez told San Diego’s KGTV , noting that it’s a “very clean tasting beer.” The local mayor Kevin Faulconer was actually among one of the first to take the plunge and try the ale and give it a glowing review.\nJust goes to show: one man’s trash can still be turned into another man’s (liquid) treasure. All it takes is an industrial-scale recycling system and some creative, alcoholic additives. \n. @StoneBrewingCo brewed the Stone #FullCircle Pale Ale with purified water from the City’s demonstration Pure Water Facility #PureStone 🍺💧 pic.twitter.com/DKZ4dchVfn \n— Pure Water San Diego (@PureWaterSD) March 17, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:25:37.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
