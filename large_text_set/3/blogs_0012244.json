Well, the Ryzen 5 line of processors will take on Intel's own incredibly successful Core i5 brand, which is the sort of processor we'd recommend for most mid-range to lower-high-end PC gaming builds. It used to be the default choice, but with the announcement of Ryzen 5, things just got a whole lot more interesting. \nThese are the specifications of the four new Ryzen 5 chips. Two of them will be six-core, while the other two will be quad-core, and all will launch on April 11. \n6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 1600X, 3.6-4GHz 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 1600, 3.2-3.6GHz 4-core, 8-thread Ryzen 5 1500X, 3.5-3.7GHz 4-core, 8-thread Ryzen 5 1400, 3.2-3.4GHz \nThere are loads of interesting things to talk about here. The first is that AMD has entered a six-core chip (1600X and 1600) into the mid-range market, which could prove to be a brilliant gaming/video editing workhorse. The top-end 1600X has a decent maximum clock speed of 4GHz, although this is behind Intel's all conquering Core i5-7600K, which tops out at 4.2GHz and can be overclocked to well beyond that. \nClock speed is the biggest influence on gaming performance right now, so Intel would appear to have the upper hand in this regard. \nWhile all Ryzen chips are unlocked for a bit of automatic or manual overclocking, we weren't hugely blown away with the performance with our eight-core Ryzen 7 1800X sample. \nRelated: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review \nIf this continues with Ryzen 5, we wouldn't be surprised if it trailed Intel slightly in gaming benchmarks. However, with simultaneous multi-threading (read more below) that results in 12 threads from six cores, it could be quite the video editing beast. \nThat's what AMD chose to market in its initial presentation slides shown to the press: the only performance comparison it opted to make was that the 1600X can manage a Cinebench rendering peformance that's up to 69% better than a Core i5-7600K. \nThis isn't a huge surprise since the Ryzen 5 1600X has three times as many threads as the quad-core Core i5. \nRelated: Intel Skylake review \nThe key will be price, and AMD hasn't managed the same headline-grabbing price difference as it did with its top-end Ryzen 7 processors. \nIndeed, the Ryzen 5 1600X will start at $249 in the US (about £250 inc VAT), which lines up almost exactly with the Core i5-7600K's current RRP. Dropping down to the Ryzen 5 1600, which will likely rival the £212/$229 Core i5-7600, the price falls to, $219 (about £214 inc VAT). \nThe two quad-core chips, the 1500 and 1400, are perhaps the most interesting here as they have RRPs of $189 (about £184 inc VAT) and $169 (about £165 inc VAT), respectively. This is a price bracket that Intel doesn't really have covered, aside from with its fairly unexciting i5-7400 so it'll be fascinating to see whether these processors can come remotely close when it comes to gaming. \nThe only thing we don't know yet is thermal design power (TDP). This determines the sort of cooling the chips will need to get up to full speed and whether you'll realistically be able ot slot them into a compact PC case. We'd suspect they'll match Intel fairly closely, but the slides we've been shown don't confirm this. \nAll four of these new chips will slot nicely into AMD's new AM4 chipsets, which you can read more about below. \nThe Ryzen 5 1400 will ship with AMD's new Wraith Stealth cooler, while the 1600 and 1500X will get the larger Wraith Spire. \nAMD is expecting to launch its budget-end Ryzen 3 chips in the second half of this year. \nRead on for a full primer on AMD's Ryzen architecture. What is AMD Ryzen? \nRyzen is AMD's newest brand of high-end processors, taking on Intel's own Core i5 and i7 chips at their own game. The technology is based on AMD's Zen architecture, which uses a 14nm process for manufacturing smaller and more power-efficient chips. \nAMD has long struggled when it comes to so-called \"instructions per clock\" (IPC), and while its processors of old have all had high clock speeds (measured in GHz), they often ran hot without the same efficiency as Intel's finest. Read on for more technical info on AMD Ryzen, as well as the latest news. \nRelated: Best CPU coolers AMD Ryzen: Why is it important and what can it do? \nAlthough the PC market may be in decline, there's one area that's showing growth: performance and gaming. It's no surprise, then, that AMD is aiming Ryzen at that market, hoping to attract PC gaming fans away from Intel rigs. \nThis also shows that AMD is once again ready to compete with Intel properly. In the past, as discussed above, AMD didn't have Intel's performance per clock. This meant that the only way the company could match Intel's performance would be to increase clock speeds and power consumption. \nWith Ryzen and the Zen architecture in general, AMD has revamped its processor architecture to make it more efficient and capable of performing more work per cycle. \nVideo: Watch AMD's Ryzen launch event \nFast forward to 15 minutes in for the start of the stream \nAMD has confirmed that Ryzen is capable of doing 40% more work per clock cycle, compared to the previous-generation Excavator core. Impressively, power consumption per cycle remains the same. AMD had these goals from the outset, but it's good to know that this has been achieved. \nSo, how did AMD achieve Ryzen's performance boost? Partly, it's down to the new 14nm process, which means more transistors can fit onto a given piece of silicon, resulting in improved performance without a big increase in power consumption. \nAn entirely new architecture also helps. Importantly, Ryzen chips support “Simultaneous Multi-Threading”, which is similar to Intel’s Hyper-Threading tech. This allows for better distribution and handling of multiple tasks. For the high-end chip, there are eight cores that can handle 16 threads. SenseMI drives performance and efficiency \nUnderpinning the processor are a series of new technologies bundled under the SenseMI umbrella term. These are technologies to make the processor more efficient and powerful. \nPure power is first. This uses monitors on the processor to work out the amount of energy required for any given task. In other words, the processor will run only as fast as it needs to, saving power when the system is relatively idle. \nPrecision Boost is AMD's equivalent to Intel's Turbo Boost, increasing clock speed on the fly to deliver maximum performance when you need it. The company is promising that its speed-boost tech is super-smart, providing 25MHz steps with no latency or queue drain. \nExtended Frequency Range (EFR) is an automatic overclocking that kicks in if there's enough thermal headroom. EFR needs no user intervention and licks in automatically, while the processor remains cool. For those users who like to set everything manually, Ryzen can still be overclocked in the usual way. \nNeural Net Prediction is designed to speed up the CPU, by pre-loading instructions and choosing the best path through the CPU. With the right prediction, the CPU no longer has to wait for instructions to be loaded. \nSmart Prefetch is the final tool, designed to work out where the code is, anticipating the location of future data. This data can then be stored in the cache, so that the CPU isn't slowed down waiting for comparatively slow system memory. The new platform is AM4 \nAMD's new AM4 platform will accompany Ryzen. It brings all of the new tech that you'd expect, including DDR4 RAM, PCI-E Gen 3, USB 3.1 Gen 2, NVMe and SATA Express. AMD is promising that this is a platform that you can \"buy and know that this will work for years and years\". AMD Zen Performance \nYou can read more about performance in our AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review, but in short Ryzen offers blistering multi-core performance up against a more expensive Intel CPU, but is still sligtly wanting in gaming performance versus cheaper Intel CPUs. These are problems that are hopefully going to be ironed out through software updates, but it is a minor mark on an otherwise very clean report sheet. \nRelated: Best gaming PC \nAMD says the Zen architecture won’t only be limited to enthusiast desktop chips. Laptops and servers are also expected to benefit from Zen in the future, although the laptop part (Raven Ridge) won't launch until the end of 2017. \nZen architecture will also make it to AMD APUs, meaning you’ll be able to buy a full chip with both Zen architecture and AMD Radeon graphics on board. These have proven relatively successful for budget gaming PCs in the past, so with better processing performance and graphics, AMD could really take a bite out of the budget gaming market. \nAMD Ryzen 5 or Intel Core i5, which do you think will prevail? Let us know in the comments below. 0 shares cheese king December 14, 2016, 10:30 am \nVery nice to see AMD finally catch up, unless this is just hype. I wonder though if this will drive Intels prices down or whether AMD will simply load their prices to match, we'll have to see, Intels prices have been frankly ludicrous for years now which is one of the reasons I still using a 2700k. Adrian S December 14, 2016, 11:17 am \nI do not really need I7 perfomance, so I hope AMD will make something that compares with the I5 at a lower price, saying that if AMD do produce a I7 comparable chip for a good price then I will get it. Hardscrabblehammer December 14, 2016, 1:52 pm \nGaming enthusiasts like myself realize that we don't need something that beats the fastest Intel offering. A lot of us are using i7-3770K or even i7-2500k without issues. My CPU feeds all the info my GTX 1070 can use. But someday my mobo, and/or cpu will go to binary heaven, and so what I, and a lot of other people need, is an upgrade path that gets us close to Intel for an affordable price. I probably won't want to pony up the cash for the 8-core 16 thread chip, but if they come out with a quad or hex-core variant for $300, which to be honest would be very much an ADM thing to do, I'd be all over that. Athenasius December 14, 2016, 2:54 pm \nAMD's 8 core is probably going to be far cheaper than people think. And far from the price of the 6900k. Thomas December 15, 2016, 9:17 pm \nMy 5 year old 2550k at 4.5 Mhz has kept my Nvidia 670 rocking my HDTV at 1080p 60Hz just fine. Until I can get a HDR 4k 120Hz TV/Monitor with freesync I have no reason to upgrade. Perhaps an AMD 490 / Zen combination will make sense. I refuse to pay the extra $100-$200 for a G-Sync monitor over a freesync monitor, and would rather put that money into a better graphics card. Once it makes sense to get a better monitor then I will upgrade. HDR rocks ! Zero'clock Gaming January 20, 2017, 5:59 pm \nidk man, a 3770k cant stream at 1080p 60fps with slow or more compression, so I would love a better cpu. John 'Genryu' February 2, 2017, 12:48 am \nThe only real growth sector with CPU's is at the $200 - $300 price point. If AMD cannot bring out a CPU with good performance at that point, this will be a massive failure. Very few care about $700 CPUS enough to buy them. Also the article makes the same mistake as many others, there will be a six core CPU on offer practically from launch. Dave Bristel February 7, 2017, 8:33 pm \nI'd expect the R5 and even the lower side of the R7 range may land in that range. A critical issue has always been when the OEMs suck up supply of processors, making it difficult to find what you want for yourself. AMD is aware of this, and for the initial supply, we SHOULD be able to get a chip, leaving HP, Dell, and Lenovo to wait. \nAs far as $700 processors, the real key is that those who really need that level of CPU will pay, not just the enthusiast group. Getting something that will last for 7 years without being seen as an old and slow piece of junk also appeals to some people. Hell, my Phenom 2 X4 955 still does well enough with 8GB of DDR2 memory to keep up with the $450 computers on the market, and it really does need to be replaced. Still, quad core 3.2GHz....seems like it fits into the current $450-$500 desktop computer market, doesn't it? Azmodan February 8, 2017, 6:35 am \nThe good thing is you will get something to compete with the i5 and with hyperthreading to boot. mode11 February 8, 2017, 7:54 am \nBit weird that (according to the article at least) most of the range is 6 and 8 core chips with hyper-threading. That's a tiny market. What they need is a decent ~3.5GHz i5/i7 competitor at a lower price. Given that Intel desktop CPU performance has plateaued in the last 5 years, that shouldn't be an unachievable goal. Intel's concentrating on mobile CPUs these days - they're performance per watt at the lower end would be much harder to reach. Adrian S February 8, 2017, 8:45 am \nLets hope so, but it just seems to be taking ages.# putin and the greeks February 9, 2017, 4:48 pm \nthe whole cpu market is very suspect ,,,i need 24 cores right now stop giving me tiny updates ,,,dam you intel and amd ,,i need more power stop selling me toys...i'm very angry ZoubIWah February 10, 2017, 4:11 am \nof course it canyou forgot to specify what compression, and blabla. it can play a 1080p60fps h264 main profile no problem.and all games no problem (gpu is the bottleneck) \nive a i7-2600k for 5 or 6 years (basically when it came out) and any cpu replacement today will only barely help in any game. ZoubIWah February 10, 2017, 4:12 am \nthe thing is, you'll need a much better gpu to enjoy a 4k 120hz (thus 120fps unless u wanna play around 25fps with freesync but then why... ;-) \nby that time the cpus will be even cheaper. Bennett Russell February 11, 2017, 8:19 am \nuntil you look at the IPC, and the power consumption of your processor, the fact that you can get ddr2 for practically free, and the fact that it has no SMT/Hyperthreading Bennett Russell February 11, 2017, 8:25 am \nno, your GPU is syncing with you monitor to force an average of roughly 60 FPS, with a 1070 you should get atleast 120 FPS at 1080p in ANY game before the GPU becomes the bottleneck. paradroid2 February 12, 2017, 9:17 am \nStill on a 45 watt AMD here. I think it's fine for everyday tasks. Surfing the web on heavy sites or photoshopping and such is noticeably slower than my skylake i7 at work, but not annoyingly so. I'm hoping this 65w Ryzen will be a good cpu to replace mine with. Yo Hannis February 13, 2017, 9:36 am \nme too, i'll go for 65W ones. i think i'll get AMD Ryzen 5 1400X Bob Rooney February 15, 2017, 4:14 am \nthis. then again, that amd chip will last 4 chipsets. thats what go me through the phenom 2 years. 790fx mobo, 870a, 990fx. 2008 to god knows how long. its still running in my mom's home as a pass-me-down. A Glass of Water (IN VR) February 17, 2017, 6:42 pm \nYep found the Intel fanboy Glib February 18, 2017, 12:50 am \nSo, if AMDs 6 core (regardless of clockspeed) costs more than $250, you're going to buy a $425-$600 Intel chip? All because you think a debugger will reduce crashes? It won't, FYI: at best it'll halt the process and crash the software. So you know, the top-end 6 core Ryzen is rumoured to cost $247, though I'm sure you'd come up with some other illogical reason why you wouldn't buy it. \nAs well, in case you didn't know, you're WAY more likely to reduce the number of crashes (as if that even happens to modern CPUs outside of server applications) with ECC RAM, which the Intel's you're speaking of do NOT support, but the Ryzen ones might (we will soon see, I'd presume yes). Zaven February 18, 2017, 5:44 pm \noh there is a misunderstanding. i am NOT saying Intel i7 will be FASTER than AMD. Intel comes with integrated graphics worth like 40-60 dollars and I am an video, software programming professional who doesn't need a video card other than integrated graphics. With that being said, an i7, quad core 8 thread will have similar performance to AMD 6 core 12 thread (since not everything is about cores and processing speed). IT COMES DOWN THAT BOTH HAVE SIMILAR PRICING FOR SIMILAR ABILITIES. AMD shouldn't try to out-compute Intel but try to create slightly slower processors at a cheaper price. Right now, AMD is doing the first, not the latter. If both are at similar speeds at similar prices, i will buy intel for the name because i am not stupid. I mean who wouldn't buy a macbook with the same specs as a windows laptop for the same price???? who woulldn't buy a good that cost similar to another but has a way better name??? Zaven February 18, 2017, 5:48 pm \nbtw i am talking about unlocked ryzen 5 processor being equal to an i7 7the gen and that costs 320+ while the i7 costs 420+ Zaven February 18, 2017, 6:02 pm \nbtw i am not an AMD fan i am using FX 8350 right now because its is cheap octa-core where as the new octacores from amd costs $500 and hyperthreading does not make your processor twice as fast but approximately 1.4 times faster because strings cant be strung at same time and it needs a refresh phase. Zaven February 21, 2017, 6:28 am \nyes someone finally understands me!!! AMD target audience is not professionals but people who want performance for little pricing. if you make amd and intel same price, i will get intel not only because of branding but also better drivers, able to operate at higher temperatures, supports linux better, contains a gpu, and so much more.
