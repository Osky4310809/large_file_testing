(Photo: Instagram) More Kristen Cavallari doesn’t hold back on social media. After her followers body-shamed her husband, football player Jay Cutler, on Instagram in January, the 30-year-old defended him in a follow-up post — calling out the rude comments . She also recently shared a personal post describing what her time living in Chicago meant to her. However, Cavallari shared even more than usual when she posted a nude photo of Cutler while on vacation on Tuesday. “‘Good times, no tan lines. Let the sea set you free” – @tony2coats ,'” she captioned the image, quoting Tony Scheffler, Cutler’s former Denver Broncos teammate. Cavallari’s followers, naturally, had a lot to say about the image — and some weren’t exactly fans. “Not sure this is your usual class of a post.

Kristin I’m sure you and Jay get a good laugh at all these idiot haters. Have fun on vacay!” another user commented. Some took the opportunity to poke fun at Cutler’s free agent status in the comments. “Hahahaha I mean I guess he’s enjoying his early retirement,” one user, richshepherd29, wrote. “Someone give Jay’s naked a** a job! He’s going crazy over there,” another added. “A candid look at Jay Cutler, as defenses have seen him for the last 8 years…naked, with his a** out,” another user, Ahman Hicks, added. Cavallari later uploaded a scenic beach shot from their oasis in Mexico, adding a cheeky caption referencing her earlier post. “ In case my last post gets deleted, here’s the unobstructed view #GonnaMissThisPlace ,” she captioned the shot.
