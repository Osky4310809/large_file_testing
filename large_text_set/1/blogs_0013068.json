Images via \nThis article was originally published on December 1, 2014 but we think it still rocks! \nGIF-iti is a different kind of creature: equal parts street and GIF art, it represents an important shift in digital arts culture, one in which the artwork itself breaks free of its restrictions both against a wall and on a computer screen. Artist Ryan Seslow and Vandalog editor-in-chief RJ Rushmore launched Encrypted Fills , a digital gallery space and archive to showcase the intersection of digital art and street art. For their inaugural exhibition, they have curated a broad range of works by GIF-iti pioneer, INSA , as well as Broken Fingaz, Rone, Peter Drew, John Fekner, Olek, Swampy, and more. \nRushmore and Seslow noticed the growing tide of experimentation with digital mediums by street artists. “Sometimes the aesthetics of the work are nearly indistinguishable from static street pieces, and other times these digital works are hardly recognizable as related to street art or graffiti, but we believe that these new works come from the same place,\" says Rushmore. \"Artists who have been getting up outdoors are now reaching out to a similar digital public, and it’s opened the door for those artists to reach beyond static images.” Seslow adds that their goal is to promote the unique genre of grafitti combined with digital art as a distinct from other art forms, and to preserve the creations for future reference. \nBelow, some original GIF artworks from Encrypted Fills: \nOnline Love by INSA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T11:36:37.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
