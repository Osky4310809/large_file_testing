You’d think he has a business to run. \nBut I digress. \nIn our call, we talked about how Rentify is attempting to make life a lot easier for landlords by taking on much of the risk regards managing and letting out a property — with the help of technology, of course. And we touched on how difficult it is to scale a tech startup that still employs a lot of human labour. \nBut where things got most lively is that Spencer doesn’t like the tech press very much. In fact, he basically thinks we suck, with the exception of his “very good friend” James Cook at Business Insider. Actually I’m not sure I got that bit right. Naturally, I pushed back a little. And then some. \nYou can listen to the full interview below. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T11:27:16.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
