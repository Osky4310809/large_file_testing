It's causing a bit of a debate. \nMums in Brazil are concerned that people aren't able to differentiate between boys and girls, so are resorting to the accessories to define gender (boys can wear bows if they like). \nVideos have been posted to Facebook about something called 'Girlie Glue', which is used to stick accessories to babies. It's made of agave syrup and water – so is essentially harmless. But has provoked outrage in some circles nonetheless. \nMum and customer Heloise Katharine Kieper says in one video: \"In a daily stress, there is no time to take good care of the baby and put on nice pink clothes. \n\"I can only do the ponytail and put a bow on her hand, but she ends up looking like a boy. This is perfect and it also does not hurt when I paste the glue.\" Is this okay? (Photo: Facebook) Read More \nOne video, shared by Playground, has been viewed over three million times since Tuesday. It seems gender identification is a big issue for mums. Many support the use of the substance on babies: \nMafer Becerra Quiroz said: \"I love the idea of ​​a nice little bow on a baby. I mean, there is absolutely nothing wrong. Not like it's super glue. There are people who are confused when they see a girl or boy because there are babies that are very ugly and with a nice bow it changes everything.\" \nAnother said: \"If it doesn't hurt the baby, if it's animal cruelty–free and it's proven that it really won't hurt the baby, I don't care if they use it or not. If to them they look prettier, go ahead and do it. \" Should 'gender statements' like this be a thing of the past? (Photo: Moment Open) Read More 'Inspirational' youngster left for dead by hit-and-run motorist makes recovery against all odds But others found Girlie Glue completely weird. Others argued that while agave syrup and water aren't actual adhesives, there could still be problems. Would it have an effect on cradle cap? \nCommenting on the Playground video, Roberto Dominguez wrote: \"Do not need a bow on [a baby's] head to identify gender. Stop it. It's demeaning, absurd and distasteful\". \n\"This is so stupid,\" added one mum. \"First, I don't think using glue is healthy, even if it's special, on the head of a baby. Second, who cares if it's a boy or a girl? While they are at it why don't they glue a neon sign on the parents' chest saying they are idiots.\" \nAnd another mum said: \"I don't need a bow on the head to identify a girl – the name and the mom telling me she's a girl is enough. This is shameful, absurd, and total bad taste.\" poll loading What do you think about Girlie Glue? 0+ VOTES SO FAR It's fine, it doesn't harm the baby! It's totally ridiculous and isn't appropriate I'm undecided and don't want to judge until I've seen it in real life \nGirle Glue isn't a new product, but the latest round of videos have sparked renewed interest in what's clearly a controversial thing. There is, obviously, a point about feminism and gender identity as well as welfare. \nA representative of Girlie Glue spoke to BuzzFeed about the bows. They rejected the idea that it is inappropriate. \n\"There will always be individuals who want to force their negative opinions on others,\" they said. \"People like to find fault and point fingers, when there is really nothing behind their accusations. We have never discriminated gender. \n\"We have never said it is important to distinguish baby girls from baby boys. We force our product on no one. We love and stand by our product. Those who criticize us just do not understand the product. If people don't want to use it they don't have to! \n\"Our product is completely safe to be used on hair and skin. We always recommend that small accessories, as with any small object, should be used with adult supervision.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:18:03.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
