Still a college student and new to the startup world, he nonetheless came up with one in three hours.\nIt was raw, but convincing enough.\n\nView and download this document on Slideshare . Here’s the spreadsheet of the financial projections. \nBy 2012, Willis had built a core team of 11, and tripled the site’s monthly pageviews. To grow further, he had to raise another round of funding .\nThis time around, his slide deck wouldn’t look out of place in today’s startup world.\n\nView and download this document on Slideshare . \nGlimpse of the future Investor pitch decks are about promoting not just the company’s current strengths, but also what it can become. They sell the beautiful story of the constant upward climb into rapid user growth and abundant moolah.\nReal life is far more complicated though, and you can see this when you compare where Tech in Asia is today with what was pitched in those presentations.\nMany of our plans died. Our expansion into China failed as we couldn’t find product-market fit.\nWe tried building a wiki of startups and investors, but were let down by an outsourcing firm we engaged. Willis eventually ditched the idea as he felt building a product wasn’t his cup of tea.\nThe lack of a startup database also meant that the idea for a jobs board couldn’t take off.\nA lot of people complained that the ads were very annoying. So we decided not to do it. Another idea that was pitched in both presentations was that we’d monetize through advertising. Willis pulled the plug even though he was seeing much-needed revenue from it. He made S$3,000 (US$2,100) a month from advertising before any external funding came in.\n“I didn’t know how to build products but I cared about our users. A lot of people complained that the ads were very annoying. So we decided not to do it,” he says.\nA big regret that Willis has – and perhaps his biggest mistake so far – was not investing in product and engineering fast enough.\n“We became more product- and engineering-focused only much later,” he adds.\nWhat went right It’s still heartening to see, though, how many of the ideas pitched since 2011 have come to life today.\nOur conferences now span four countries. We have a solid product and engineering team. We finally have a database of startups and investors, as well as a jobs board.\nWe’ve found an advertising model in branded content that promises a superior user experience over banner ads.\nAgainst this backdrop, it’s amusing to see Willis get embarrassed over the mistakes in the first business plan as we look at it together.\nWhat he isn’t embarrassed about, however, is what Tech in Asia has achieved.\n“I feel happy I surpassed these numbers,” he says. “Whatever I promised investors, they tended to be close to what I achieved in the end.”\nGot a cool slide deck you want to share?
