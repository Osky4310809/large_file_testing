Police said the vehicle was moving at a high rate of speed on Roosevelt Road when it hit the man as he was crossing the street at Des Plaines Avenue. \nThe victim suffered major injuries — his leg may have been severed — and he was rushed to the hospital. His condition was stabilized Monday morning. \n“There was a lot of blood, so they applied a tourniquet,” Police Chief Tom Aftanas tells CBS 2’s Dana Kozlov. \nPolice have released an image of the car, recorded by a nearby red light camera. \n“The offending vehicle described by witnesses is a possible Chevrolet Camaro, black in color, with darkly tinted windows,” Forest Park police said in a news release.
