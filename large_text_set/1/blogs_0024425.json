US travel ban – a brief guide \nTrump’s executive order suspends the US’s entire refugee resettlement programme – the largest in the world – for 120 days, places a temporary 90-day ban on visitors   countries, and an indefinite ban on the arrival of Syrian refugees. \nTrump frames the policy as one of keeping the US safe from terrorism. But a quick glance at the list – Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – shows that it clearly omits several major candidates for a US anti-terrorist “no-fly list” such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. \nThis is because the list is not a top seven terrorist producing countries list but a list of the top seven countries which produce refugees who have been given sanctuary in the US – often fleeing state terrorism and war. \nTrump has declared the aim of his policy is to cut the number of UNHCR-nominated refugees resettled in America this year from the planned 110,000 to 50,000. \nThe UN refugee agency’s resettlement programme, in which US presidents have taken the biggest role since 1980, is the largest in the world. It has, up to now, been seen as a crucial component of America’s national identity as welcoming the “huddled masses yearning to breathe free”. \nBut Trump’s adoption of temporary bans and “extreme vetting” in the name of anti-terrorism now threatens to undermine the international system of refugee protection and the global stability it helps to provide. It will also leave in limbo 60,000 UNCHR-nominated refugees who have already been through a lengthy vetting process and now banned from entering the US. \nAt the heart of the matter is Trump’s rejection of the UNHCR vetting process , despite the fact that those nominated have to be approved by no fewer than 24 US departments and agencies before they are accepted for resettlement. \nThe UNHCR says it is “acutely aware” of host countries’ “entirely legitimate” concerns about the resettlement programme being used as a cover for terrorists, and adds that it uses biometric data, audit trails and an electronic registration database to ensure the integrity of its programmes. \nBut this is not enough for Trump. He is clearly going to substitute a US-only vetting system, further undermining trust in the UNHCR system. \nTheresa May is already way past him. When David Cameron pledged Britain to take 20,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees May insisted that the UNHCR not be involved in nominating them. Instead Home Office officials have been sent to the camps to select by their own criteria those who should be brought to Britain. The Guardian view on Theresa May’s speech: back to the nasty party | Editorial Read more \nMay wants to go much further. In her party conference speech in October 2015 , amid the world’s worst refugee crisis since the second world war, she outlined a new asylum strategy under which only temporary protection would be given to all but the world’s most vulnerable refugees. She said she was keen to see the international legal definition of a refugee made much stricter. \nThe prime minister may well have been embarrassed by the clumsy “dual-national” interpretation of Trump’s temporary bans that led to the prospect of Farah and Zahawi being told they were no longer welcome in the US. \nTrump’s underlying policy on refugees is to undermine the accepted international system of refugee protection that has been in place since 1951. Theresa May is already ahead of him on that road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T16:18:38.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
