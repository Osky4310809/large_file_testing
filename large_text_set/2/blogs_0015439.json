Feb 17, 2017: Zlatan scores his 17th treble, 17th goal v St Etienne and his 17th goal/assist in 17 Old Trafford appearances 😲 pic.twitter.com/cA4Nn2Lisu — FOX SPORTS Football (@FOXFootballLive) February 16, 2017 \nBut put his scoring records to one side for a moment, and there are even more impressive figures. \nNo Premier League player has played more games in all competitions this season than Ibrahimovic (36). \nThat says a lot considering there were initially doubts over his durability in English football at his age. \nHis form even prompted Red Devils legend Ryan Giggs to agree there are similarities between Ibrahimovic and Eric Cantona, who was nicknamed the ‘King of Manchester’. \n“I think there’s similarities because of that confidence they have in their own ability and the goals that they have scored,” Giggs told The Mail. \n“It didn’t faze Eric or Ibrahimovic coming to United and being the No 1 player. \n“Even when they are playing well and getting all the adoration, they don’t get carried away. \n“It’s their job and you can see that he is a good professional, he is always fit and at his age to play centre-forward and to produce the goals he is producing is unbelievable.” \nIn reality, the only thing that may be playing on Ibrahimovic’s mind is ensuring his emphatic form converts into trophies with Manchester United. 36 - No Premier League player has played more games in all competitions this season than Zlatan Ibrahimovic (36).

Realistically, their PL ambition is to reclaim a top four spot. \nEven though he’s already lifted almost 20 club trophies and countless individual awards, it’s obvious that his desire to win more hasn’t diminished at the end of his career. \nAfter the Europa League win last week, Ibrahimovic emphasised that by comparing himself with fictional archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones. Zlatan gifted by St Etienne 0:41 \n“Every trophy for me is incredible, everywhere I came I won so if I can win something here I will be super happy,” he said. \n“People that know me know that I play in many clubs and I try to do my best. \n“Wherever I went I won, so I am like Indiana Jones.” \nPerhaps the whole United squad can take something from his 10 secrets to success and happiness that he shared in 10 video clips on the club’s Instagram feed.

But the smile needs to be a real smile.” \n2. “Enjoy life, because life can be short, can be long, but make sure you enjoy it because life is beautiful.” \n3. “Don’t be too serious because if you’re always serious, people may think something different about you. Make sure you joke, smile, have fun, give people energy.” \n4. “Practice, practice and practice because without practice, you cannot become what you want in whatever you want.” \n5. “Work hard because when you work hard, everything comes back to you. For whatever you want to be, work hard because it shouldn’t be easy, because we don’t like it the easy way, we like it the hard way.” Ibrahimovic in a training session. Source: AFP \n6. “Master your man stare. I have mine, make sure you find yours. Like this, people will be afraid of you.” \n7. “Why do it normal? Why do it more than normal? Do it brilliant. We want to be brilliant in whatever we do because people remember brilliant.” \n8. “Whatever happens, your family will always be there. So make sure you take care of your family from day one until the end because they’re the important ones. Whatever anyone else says is not important but what your family says is very important.” \n9. “Have respect and gain respect. Once I learned in my life, when I met Fabio Capello, he said to me, ‘You don’t ask for respect, you get your respect.’ Make sure you also get your respect.” \n10. “In whatever you do, you need to believe in yourself and you need to have confidence for what you are doing, or else it will be very difficult.” Zlatan Ibrahimovic of Manchester United celebrates with a fan.
