So are they.\nThe Untitled Space gallery in New York City opened a powerful exhibition titled UPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN on Tuesday, featuring the work of 80 female contemporary artists responding to the current social and political climate in America in light of the 2016 presidential election.\nCurated by gallery director and artist Indira Cesarine, the exhibit displays 80 pieces of art created by American, female-identifying artists, created between the election and President-elect Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.\nSEE ALSO: Watch a fiery congressman explain why he'll be holding his wife's hand at the Women's March this year\n\"The day after the election results were announced, in fact - that afternoon that Hillary conceded, I just personally felt compelled to like start working on the exhibit,\" Cesarine told Mashable. \"It just struck me that...a lot of artists would have very passionate works and statements to say with their art work right now with regards to... subjects revolving around a lot of the issues that were revealed over the course of the Trump campaign.\"\n\"Donald Trump with a Crown of Roadkill\"\nImage: CARA DEANGELIS / UPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN\n\"F$@KTrump\"\nImage: Kristen Williams / UPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN\nSet to run from Jan. 17-28 in the Tribeca gallery, the exhibit will be displayed throughout Trump's inauguration week, purposefully timed with the Jan. 21 Women’s March on Washington , the J20 Art Strike and various inaugural protests around the country.\n\"It’s important for the work to be timely and relevant with what’s going on,\" the curator explained, \"It’s a series of art that responds directly to the election, and to Trump’s presidency... as well as his attitude and comments and campaign.\"\n\"We’re voicing our anger and using that as a tool to challenge the status quo.\"\nWith over 1800 submissions of artwork by over 400 artists, it was one of the most challenging exhibits the curator had to date.\n\"It was a far bigger response than I was expecting,\" she said. \"Particularly as we noted that we were prioritizing new works created specifically for the show.\"\"Every artist responded in such a different way,\" Cesarine explained.\n\"American Angst\"\nImage: Annika Connor / UPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN\nImage: Bia Monteiro / UPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN\n\"Every artist responded in such a different way,\" Cesarine explained. \"Some artists had very figurative, emotional responses of anger, fear, sadness, feeling like the world is over...and other artists had very satirical works that are actually very amusing.\"\nThe name of the exhibit, UPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN, is no arbitrary choice.\n\"The idea of women who are strong and powerful being angry is often used against them. A powerful female boss is often referred to as a ‘bitch,’\" Cesarine said. \"Our show title sort of plays on not only … the feeling with having such a sexist, misogynist, racist president being elected, but also challenge that whole stereotype of a powerful woman with an opinion.\"\n\"We’re voicing our anger and using that as a tool to challenge the status quo in art,\" she said.\n\"Wrong Side Feelings\"\nImage: Mila Rochenne / UPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN\n\"Dear Partriarch\"\nImage: Tracy Brown / UPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN\n\"I can be bold and unapologetic in my paintings... I'm angry.\"\n\"Painting allows me to say...things and convey ideas and concepts that I would not normally speak out loud,\" artist Kristen Williams wrote of her work in the exhibit, \"I can be bold and unapologetic in my paintings.\"\n\"I'm angry at America for electing a reality TV star, racist, misogynist, to be our new commander in chief,\" the artist continued, \"I am angry for so many reasons...my way of dealing with this anger is not to pick up a gun, not to fight physically, but to pick up my paintbrush and to put my feelings on canvas.\"\nThe aim of the exhibit is to create, \"A platform for the artwork to be visible, for it to be seen, and to make sure that that artwork gets out there and is represented,\" according to the curator. \"I think that there’s a lot of artists that are responding with their own works of art right now on these subjects, but at the end of the day if it’s not exhibited – on a public platform, in an art gallery…it just ends up lost in the shuffle.\"\n\"I thought it very important...to take the opportunity the minute that the election results were announced to make sure that we channel all that passion and rage that people...and artists are feeling right now,\" she continued.\n\"Artists, as we all know, are a reflection of populous and have always represented... how society is feeling.\"\nUPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN\nImage: CHRISTINA CAREAGA/MASHABLE\n\"I really wanted that to reflect in the work and not just specifically be a New York City show, but be an American show about the issues,\" Cesarine said, highlighting that artists featured in the exhibit come from diverse backgrounds across the country.\n\"CurrentMood\"\nImage: Jen Dwyer / UPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN\n\"Winning-Personality Target\"\nImage: Lili White / UPRISE / ANGRY WOMEN\n\"I see this exhibit not only as a collective of feminist and political work, but also as an act of protest in itself against [Trump] being elected,\" she continued.\nAll of the exhibit's powerful art is for sale, with 25 percent of the profits being donated to the ERA Coalition's Fund for Women's Equality, an organization working to raise awareness on gaps in the law that leave women without legal recourse from sex discrimination, and expanding educational resources on the need for a constitutional provision to protect and promote equal rights for women.\nUPRISE / ANGRY
