Hameed Ibrahim Ali (retd), that the NCS would soon begin to impound vehicles being used in the country without Customs duties papers. \nOnuesoke, who spoke to journalists at Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja, Lagos, appealed to the Senate and the Presidency not to allow the directive by the NCS to take effect, adding that the directive will put more hardship on the already financially distressed citizens and provide a platform for bullying and harassment by law enforcement agencies. \nHe argued that the Customs policy has exposed the agency’s incapacitation and incompetence to perform its duty of preventing smuggled goods from entering the country. Onuesoke \nAsking the Presidency and the National Assembly to call Ali to order, Onuesoke said: “We need to examine the brains of the officers of the Customs. \nInstead of keeping quiet for failing the nation, they have turned their failure to strength to harass Nigerians. In civilised climes, this directive will be an admission of failure of the Customs to carry out its mandate efficiently. \n“Instead of organizing Customs to efficiently carry out its mandate, it wants to collect duties retroactively. If indeed duties were not correctly paid, who should be held responsible? This situation is thrust upon the nation by these same men of Customs. This directive is dead on arrival. It cannot stand. Nigerians must rise against it.” Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T02:23:24.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
