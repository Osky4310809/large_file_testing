Shares \nBethesda has revealed details of the second free Dishonored 2 update, set to arrive on the PC in beta on January 18. The update will bring two major additions to the game: More custom difficulty settings, and a \"Mission Restart/Select\" option. \nMore than 20 new difficulty sliders will be available following the update, covering aspects of the game ranging from the speed of sleep dart effectiveness to the number of enemies who will attack you at a single time, and even how effectively you can lean out from behind barriers to get a look at what's going on around you. It will also add a new Iron Man option for new games that not only exposes you to the cruel whims of permadeath, but also disables manual saving and loading, ensuring that you will live—and die—with the consequences of your actions. \nThe Mission Restart/Select option will open up the ability to replay any unlocked mission, \"giving you a better shot at nailing that Ghost or Clean Hands run.\" That seems like the sort of thing that should've been in place right from the start, but better late than never I suppose. Selected missions will begin with the state of your character (chaos level, runes, money, and that sort of thing) as it was at the start of the mission during your initial playthrough. \nNaturally, the update will also include various bug fixes and gameplay improvements. Bethesda said a detailed breakdown of the update will be announced soon.
