I looked up to Michael Owen and Stevie Gerrard and I used to dream of scoring at Anfield. Hopefully, it’ll be on Sunday – you never know. \n“No one will give us a chance, but, if we stick to our game plan, you never know what can happen in the FA Cup. \n\"You have seen it down the years… it can happen.” \nCarey, 27, expects Argyle to be ball-chasing for much of the game – but still reckons they can pull off an unlikely win. \nHe said: “It will be a great challenge for us and it will be a day that we can test ourselves against one of the best two teams in the country. \nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's pre-Plymouth press conference: Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:45:59.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
