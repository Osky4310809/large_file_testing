Ask the Lord to help you deal with the struggles you face each day. Prayer for Temptation \nDear Lord, \nYou know the temptations that I am facing today. I need your help in this battle. My flesh is weak, so I need your help and the power of your Holy Spirit to fill me with strength. Your Word promises that I will not be tempted beyond what I can bear. I ask for your strength to stand up against temptation each and every time I encounter it. \nHelp me stay awake so that temptation won't catch me by surprise. I want to keep on praying so that I won't be dragged away by evil desires. Help me keep my spirit well fed with your Holy Word so that I always remember that greater are you, Almighty God, who is living in me than any power of darkness and sin that is in the world. \nYour Word also tells me you will provide a way of escape from temptation. Please, Lord, give me the wisdom to walk away when I am tempted, and the clarity to see the way out that you will provide. Thank you, God, that you are a faithful deliverer and that I can count on your help in my time of need. \nIn the name of Jesus, I pray, \nAmen. Bible Verses for Dealing With Temptation \nStay awake and pray that you won’t be tested. You want to do what is right, but you are weak. (Matthew 26:41, CEV) \nKeep watch and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak. (Mark 14:38, NLT) \nThere he told them, “Pray that you will not give in to temptation.” (Luke 22:40, NLT) \nBut remember that the temptations that come into your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you can't stand up against it. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you will not give in to it. (1 Corinthians 10:13, NLT) \nThe Spirit and your desires are enemies of each other. They are always fighting each other and keeping you from doing what you feel you should. (Galatians 5:17, CEV) \nWhen tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.
