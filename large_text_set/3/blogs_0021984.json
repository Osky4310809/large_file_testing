The best British series spark innumerable remakes here in America, while the UK seems to only want our reality television. They work well as binge-able Netflix series as long as you’re willing to focus a little bit more than usual. Sure, you might need to pay a little more attention to them, but just look at how many series you can get through in one sitting! Thankfully, the streaming service has a wide variety to choose from, from crime thrillers to absurd comedy. So sit back with a pint and enjoy the 15 best British shows on Netflix right now.\nRelated: The 27 Best Netflix Original Series Right Now, Ranked \nBBC\nThe Detectorists (2 series) \nIt might be easy to write off the premise of two grown men who spend the majority of their time traipsing across open fields waving metal sticks around as boring, but all you have to do is give The Detectorists an episode or two to get hooked. The series centers on Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Stone), two metal detectors (sorry, “detectorists”) who are proud members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club as they spend their days digging up rubbish in other people’s property. The Detectorists could have easily gone ultra-comedic by snickering at asocial weirdos, but it treats its protagonists as just regular blokes with girlfriends, friendships, and aspirations who just happened to be passionate about their hobby. Crook (who also wrote and directed the series) and Jones and their delightful banter, and the series’ comforting music and sprawling landscapes make its 13 episodes fly by, almost too quickly.\nAdd To Netflix Queue \nBBC\nSherlock (3 series) \nIn a world chockfull of Sherlock Holmes iterations, Sherlock manages to stand out, with no little thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch’s striking charm, Andrew Scott’s crazed, over-the-top Moriarty, and the tight writing that fills its ten 90-minute mini-movies. Despite the familiar structure — Holmes and Watson crack an uncrackable case with plenty of quips and eye rolls — each episode keeps viewers guessing, laughing, and maybe feeling a little slow for not deducing as fast as the master sleuth. Packed with winks to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s original works and the intense fanbase behind it, Sherlock still manages to tell complex crime stories and breathe new life into the 130-year-old character.\nAdd To Netflix Queue BBC\nThe Office (2 series and a special) \nThe king of uncomfortable British comedy, The Office keeps it short and sweet with its treasure trove of workplace situations and peak Ricky Gervais/Stephen Merchant wit. The mockumentary follows David Brent (Gervais) in his quest for fame, approval, and a laugh at the expense of his actual job and the employees counting on him to avoid downsizing. Fans of the American version may not be as keen on the melancholic tone of the original, but there’s a place in your Netflix queue for both the hilarious, digestible Michael Scott and the cringe-inducing, delusional David Brent. The payoff of the series finale is enough for any new watcher to dig in to the hysterically painful moments. But if you need more convincing, you’ve got the best dance scene of all time .\nAdd To Netflix Queue \nNetflix\nLovesick (a.k.a. Scrotal Recall – 2 series) \nThere’s a reason why not many people have seen or even heard of this show, and it’s not just because of its original name. Lovesick isn’t groundbreaking as a dramedy, but it works because of its nonlinear storytelling and its realistic portrayal of that awkward grey area that can form between love and friendship. After Dylan learns that he has an STD, he’s forced to pass along the diagnosis to his past sexual relationships. Each episode is then a snippet of Dylan’s life along with those of his two best friends, Luke and Evie (played by Antonia Thomas, a recognizable face to Misfits fans). While chronicling Dylan’s sexual past, Lovesick really depicts the ever-changing feelings between Dylan and Evie. It’s a simple rom-com depicted in a refreshing way with an even blend of comedy, heart, and chlamydia. \nAdd To Netflix Queue BBC\nBlack Mirror (3 series) \nTo call Black Mirror bleak is a bit of an understatement, but that’s what makes the sci-fi anthology so intriguing. In each episode (13 so far), we’re given glimpses into the future or near-future where our attention- and soul-sucking technology has run amuck. Some plots may be more feasible than others , but each story is chilling in its own way and makes you want to shut your computer screen. (It may seem counter-productive for Netflix to produce episodes for a show that offers grim looks at tech, but maybe that’s why the most recent season has a few more happy endings.) It’s an Outer Limits for the digital generation, driven by series creator Charlie Brooker’s strong ideas, ideas that could dissolve any hope you have left for the future or humanity, in the most entertaining way possible.\nAdd To Netflix Queue \nBBC\nThe Fall (3 series) \nWith a serial killer (Jamie Dornan) on the loose in Belfast, the authorities bring in a cold, calculating detective (Gillian Anderson) to put an end to the murders. The Fall presents a compelling, frightening look at an intelligent murderer without dumbing down the authorities on his trail, unlike other serial killer-themed shows out there. While the series gets slowed down by a few subplots in its most recent season, the performances of Dornan and Anderson are captivating, turning the series into an intense game of cat-and-cat. Anderson has even said this is her all-time favorite role even over Dana Scully, with good reason.\nAdd To Netflix Queue Sky1\nAn Idiot Abroad (3 series) \nThe Office came from Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s diligent, hard work. Karl Pilkington was their found money. A goldmine for absurd perspectives and memorable quotes, he’s been a staple of their non-scripted projects for years, culminating in this travel show where the traveler would rather be sitting on his couch eating crisps. With Pilkington finally front-and-center, he’s let loose to be his whinging self in An Idiot Abroad , taking in the sights of the world and always finding something wrong with the beautiful cultures and scenery. The first two series are stellar, but the show picks up in hilarity in the third with the addition of Warwick Davis. Gervais and Merchant could have probably made a few more seasons out of Pilkington and Davis bickering and sightseeing, but that’s not really their style.\nAdd To Netflix Queue \nChannel 4\nDead Set (1 series) \nA zombie outbreak overtakes the set of Big Brother, but don’t be fooled into thinking that this will be a Shaun of the Dead satire of the genre. It’s gruesome. It’s gory. It’s a strong entry in the walking/running undead. All you need to know is that it’s written by Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker, meaning it’ll be bleak as hell. Much like Black Mirror , Brooker also draws underlining parallels within Dead Set about the global obsession with TV and its perversion of reality. With just five episodes, it’s around just long enough to set itself apart from a cluttered genre before its bloody end.\nAdd To Netflix Queue BBC\nLuther (4 series) \nA gritty crime drama, Luther focuses on the brooding and rage-filled John Luther (Idris Elba), a London detective whose passion and anger sometimes gets the better of him while working his near-impossible-to-solve cases. While series creator Neil Cross found inspiration in Sherlock Holmes and Columbo for the titular character, the role comes to life thanks to Elba’s unbridled performance. He solidified his status as one of the strongest leading men out there, but the show is really stolen by Ruth Wilson’s entrancing Alice Morgan, the Moriarty to his Holmes. The series starts out with more episodic “bad guys of the week” but finds a more stable status with longer cases in series 2, giving more time to flesh out its suspects and how Luther must adapt to catch them. \nAdd To Netflix Queue \nBwark Productions\nThe Inbetweeners (3 series) \nIf you thought your own high school experience was awkward, be grateful you weren’t an “inbetweener.” Living in the murky area between cool and uncool, four teens try their luck at just getting by and getting laid. Each scenario the boys go through magnifies a variety of painful youthful memories (only Inbetweeners gets to end after 25 minutes.) Making it all bearable: the likable leads and the sharp dialogue that’s true to the adolescent experience.\nAdd To Netflix Queue Channel 4\nBlack Books (3 series) \nSomewhere between dry British wit and absurdist comedy lives Black Books. Bernard Black, a crotchety bookshop owner (Dylan Moran, who also co-created the show) strives to find the balance between his love of books, his hatred of customers, and his need to drink and smoke, with his only two friends Manny and Fran along for the ride with plenty of their own flaws. The trio of oddball misfits find themselves in many a wacky situations, but it’s their strong bond and plenty of booze that keep them grounded, even if Bernard doesn’t want to admit it. The two-time BAFTA-winner is peppered with plenty of cameos and is a must for any fan of the Brit-com.\nAdd To Netflix Queue \nBBC\nBroadchurch (2 series) \nA young boy is found dead in a seemingly idyllic small town, and the detectives charged with solving the case turn up twist after twist in tracking down the murderer. Despite its familiar premise (see also: Twin Peaks, The Killing ), Broadchurch relies on its ensemble cast — specifically the impeccable David Tennant and Olivia Colman — to keep viewers caring after each red herring is tossed back into the ocean. The first series centers on the hunt for the killer while the second is on both the suspect’s trial and a reopened case from the past, but they both don’t let up in intrigue. A word of warning, though: This isn’t one of those TV dramas you should binge even if you want to. It gets heavy and emotionally exhausting, and unrestrained streaming kinda negates the effect of the show’s mysteries.\nAdd To Netflix Queue Endemol UK/The Weinstein Company\nPeaky Blinders (3 series) \nWay more than the British Boardwalk Empire , this BBC series gives Cillian Murphy the principal TV role no one knew they needed as Tommy Shelby, head of the Peaky Blinders and his family clan. Taking place in a post-WWI England, Shelby leads his gang as they seize more power and evade the scrupulous C.I. Chester Campbell (Sam Neill). Murphy kills it as the boss willing to get his hands dirty on the front lines. While the first series is a great but slow foray into the world, Peaky Blinders really builds and finds its footing in series two, including the addition of the wild Alfie Solomons (Tom Hardy).\nAdd To Netflix Queue \nFreemantle Media/Channel 4\nThe IT Crowd (5 series) \nAnother classic comedy from creator Graham Lineham, The IT Crowd shined a light on those oft-neglected saviors of any office, the I.T. department, and the hapless management working above them. The series comes to life from its ridiculous yet relatable humor and its endearing tech team. The three-person team, played by Chris O’Dowd, Richard Ayoade, and Katherine Parkinson, play off each other so well that more than makes up for the multi-cam laughter. It’s a fun show, so much so that it’s best to not think about the American version that almost happened .\nAdd To Netflix Queue BBC\nHouse Of Cards Trilogy (3 series) \nAs the Chief Whip of the British Conservative Party with enough maniacal plans to embarrass a comic book villain, what Francis Urquhart wants, Francis Urquhart gets. Ian Richardson stars as the antihero you hate to love as he schemes to seize power and become the Prime Minister of the UK. Unlike the American version, Urguhart seems much more charming and non-threatening than his Underwood counterpart, which only makes it more wicked when he makes his murderous moves. With only four episodes per series, the trilogy cuts out any fluffy subplots and gives Urcuhart enough room to weave his webs at his own pace.\nAdd To Netflix Queue \n\nFor everything else you should be streaming on Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, check out our comprehensive What To Watch guide.
