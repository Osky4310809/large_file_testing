Chelsea ready to loan Loftus-Cheek with Brighton and West Ham keen \nStandard Sport understands that Championship side Brighton are looking to take the 20-year-old on loan, while West Ham are also interested in the midfielder. \nLoftus-Cheek has started just two games — both in the EFL Cup — for new coach Antonio Conte. His only other appearance was as a late substitute in a League game in October. Last term, the England Under-21 international featured 17 times for Chelsea. \n\nJoin eToro and discover a new way to trade on the world’s leading social trading network.
