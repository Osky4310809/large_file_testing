Health & Families Are smarter kids are more likely to smoke cannabis than their less gifted peers? \nClaim of link between intelligence and cannabis use in adolescence provides fresh headache for researchers. Academic ability may determine whether a child will use cannabis in later years Tuesday 28 February 2017 00:00 GMT Click to followIndy Lifestyle Online Over 1.8m people in England and Wales, aged between 16 to 24 years, have used cannabis at least once in their lives Getty \nChildren with high and medium academic ability at age 11 are more likely to use cannabis in late adolescence compared to children with low academic ability, according to a new study published in BMJ Open. Researchers, from University College London, examined the school records of more than 6,000 children. Their analysis showed that children of medium academic ability at age 11 were more likely to go on to be either occasional or persistent users of cannabis than children of low academic ability. This was the case for both early adolescence (13 to 17 years of age) and in late adolescence (18 to 20 years of age). \nFor children with high academic ability at age 11, the results were less certain. Although they were more likely than the low ability children to use cannabis in early adolescence, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. In other words the association could have been down to chance. However, for the period between 18 and 20 years, the high ability group was significantly more likely to be either occasional or persistent users of cannabis than the low ability group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:09:19.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
