(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File) \nLOS ANGELES—Troubled singer Chris Brown has been ordered to stay away from an ex-girlfriend, model Karrueche Tran, after she said he punched her and threatened to kill her. \nIn documents made public Tuesday, a Los Angeles court granted a restraining order requested by Tran, with Brown facing arrest if he comes near her. \nTran, who has had an on-off relationship with Brown, said that he punched her in the stomach and pushed her down the stairs several years ago but that she did not call the police. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe model, who has also appeared in television series, said she requested the restraining order as Brown had recently sent her threats by text message. \n“He told a few people that he was going to kill me. He said if no one else can have me, he’s gonna ‘take me out,'” she wrote. \nBrown, who rose to fame at a young age with his R&B voice and later rap, has become notorious for allegations of abuse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:17:10.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
