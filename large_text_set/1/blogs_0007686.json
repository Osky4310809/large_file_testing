The deer, named Faline, had been a member of the Mcgaughey family for almost two years when state wildlife officials started investigating the Ulysses, Kan., family and their pet.\n“She was a very much a big pet. There was no reason for her to be killed,” Kim Mcgaughey told reporters . While it is illegal to keep a wild animal as a pet in Kansas, the family says the deer domesticated itself. “Her being domesticated was her own doing,” Mcgaughey said. “She chose to stay. I never kept her from going away and being with other deer.”\nBut state wildlife officials said something had to be done about the 2-year-old mule deer. The Mcgaughey's claim that they asked if they could vaccinate Faline or give her to a zoo or sanctuary, but the game warden shot and killed her instead.\nMcgaughey, who has always had “a way with animals,\" is devastated.\nVia The Wichita Eagle:\nAs a child she had a pet mouse she could walk on a leash, and her horses, dogs and cats were especially well trained, she said. A few times she’d mentioned to neighbors in Grant County she’d always wanted a pet deer. Her wish came true in March 2014 when she walked over to the house of some neighbors who’d been keeping a mule deer they’d found as a fawn the year before.\n“It was an instant connection and she just followed me home, about four miles,” said Mcgaughey. “She’d bonded some with the other people but not like she did with me.”\nWithin a few weeks the mule deer, which they named Faline, after Bambi’s friend and future mate in the cartoon movie, “considered herself part of the family,” Mcgaughey said. The deer continually followed Mcgaughey in and out of their home 12 1/2 miles from town, and played with all members of the family and their pets.\nTaryn Mcgaughey, Kim Mcgaughey’s daughter, has photos of her 8-year-old son playing with the deer, as well as the animal standing on the couch looking out the window or being hugged by family members. They say the deer never made a mess in their house, and would butt its head against a door, or bleat loudly, when it wanted to be let in.\nMore via The Stanly News and Press:\nShe put colorful knitted collars on the deer so that hunters would know not to shoot her. Taryn Mcgaughey, who said she believes Faline \"thought she was a dog,\" has photos and videos of the deer inside the home, standing on furniture and playing with her 8-year-old son.\n\"She was house-trained. She would come into the house behind me, sleep on the floor while I watched TV,\" Kim Mcgaughey told the commission Thursday, describing how the deer would knock on the door with her head or bleat when she wanted inside. \"I would answer her with a bleat back, because it sounded like she was hollering, 'Mom.'\"\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/01/09/details-emerge-about-pet-deer-that-was-shot-dead-by-kansas-game-warden/\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.thesnaponline.com/cnhi_network/national-game-wardens-in-kansas-killed-a-deer-in-front/article_08a78a61-dccc-5d5b-ae9a-618adb8f9c7a.html", "http://www.kansas.com/sports/outdoors/article124627634.html", "http://www.kctv5.com/story/34195700/kansas-family-speaks-out-after-pet-deer-shot-by-game-warden"], "published": "2017-01-10T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T06:26:43.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
