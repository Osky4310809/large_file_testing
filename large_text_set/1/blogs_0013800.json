Responsibilities will include research, teaching, examining, supervision and administration.\nThe Lego Foundation, who helped pave the way for Cambridge’s Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development and Learning (PEDAL) in 2015, will fund the position. The Centre examines the importance of play in education globally, according to the University’s website . \nApplications for this position closes in two days, and candidates should be sure to include a cover letter, a statement of current and future research plans, a curriculum vitae and a publications list, as well as details for three references. The job listing states pay is competitive, which can be kind of vague. But according to The Guardian , the average salary of a Cambridge professor is £83,981 ($103,489).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T19:16:58.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
