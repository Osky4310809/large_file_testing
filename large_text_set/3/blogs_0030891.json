Close queensland schools ordered to close in unprecedented move UP NEXT VIDEO Queensland schools ordered to close in unprecedented move. source: 7 News queensland schools ordered to close in unprecedented move \nEx-tropical cyclone Debbie is drenching the southeast, with flooding already closing some roads in the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast and Brisbane areas. \nThe Queensland government has ordered every school in the region to shut, from Agnes Waters in the north, the NSW border in the south and west to Nanango. \nThis includes 763 state schools, 1286 Catholic and private schools and 546 child care centres. \nIn Brisbane, university and TAFE campuses were closing early, all the theme parks on the Gold Coast were shut and beaches along the entire south eastern coast from Mackay were also closed. \nVirgin flights into the Gold Coast are also expected to cancelled from noon. \nBrisbane has already recorded a month's worth of rain in 24 hours but the worst is yet to come, with authorities saying the heaviest falls will occur on Thursday afternoon and evening. \nBrisbane's average March rainfall is 110mm but parts of the city have already seen more than that in the past day. \nDamaging winds of 90km/h, and possibly gusting to 125km/h, are also expected along the coast. \nState Police Commissioner Ian Stewart warned people in the southeast not to underestimate the danger. \n\"We're not sending a message that you might have 400 or 500 millimetres of rain in a particular area - it could actually happen everywhere,\" he warned. \nPremier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who's back in Brisbane after visiting cyclone affected areas, said Debbie was far from done with Queensland. \n\"Everyone thinks because the cyclone has now been downgraded to a low pressure system, that everything's OK,\" she told Nine Network. \n\"This is the time where we can see maximum damage and also loss to human life.\" \nDeputy Premier Jackie Trad said the risk posed by flash flooding was real, underpinning the unprecedented decision to close all south eastern schools, order public servants to leave work early and put on free public transport to get people home before the worst of the weather hits. \nJust after 10am, Queensland Rail said inbound services from Bowen Hills to Newmarket had been suspended. \nAuthorities are keeping a close watch on dams in the southeast, but so far the facilities are coping with a vast amount of water. \nBut Ms Trad said water releases from Wivenhoe, west of Brisbane, are likely on Friday or Saturday if the dam hits 90 per cent of capacity. \nNon-gated dams are overflowing on the Gold Coast but that's not unusual during heavy rain falls. \nEveryone in the southeast should find a safe place and prepare for what's ahead, Ms Trad. \nThose in low-lying areas prone to flooding should consider staying with family and friends in higher areas. No evacuation centres have been opened. \nBureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Matt Bass said the weather system should be offshore by dawn on Friday. \nBut until then, the rainfall will be extreme. \nThere are delays on the Bruce Highway at Deception Bay, north of Brisbane, with water over northbound lanes. \nBrisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk said the primary threat to the city was creek flooding. \nHe said fast rising water was likely to cut roads quickly, with the worst of the weather expected from about 3pm. Conditions are predicted to ease from 3am on Friday. \n\"Also we are going to see later tonight, and potentially later this afternoon, wind gusts of up to 100km/h,\" he told reporters, and urged residents to secure items that could become projectiles. \nHe said the council had so far distributed 40,000 sandbags, and five depots were producing them at a rate of 4000 an hour. \nThe SES has received 2800 calls for help across the state, with the number steadily rising. \nThere have been reports of people being rescued from flood waters at Toowong and Greenslopes in Brisbane, and at Logan Village south of Brisbane. \nMost of the calls have come from the central region, but also from people in the Sunshine Coast and other southeastern locations who want help with sandbagging. \nQueensland Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Katarina Carroll warned of \"horrendous\" conditions ahead, as news cameras captured significant flooding in some parts of the city, including East Brisbane, Moorooka and Greenslopes. \nShe again warned people to stay away from flood waters as the weather worsens, because emergency crews might not be able to respond. \n\"We will respond for as long as we can, but there will become a point later tonight where we mightn't be able to.\" \nShe said there had been 400 calls for help to the SES from the Brisbane area alone. \n\"There will be strong winds this afternoon, 95-100kmh winds, so it's a combination of that wind and the rain, but they will spiral those SES tasks.\" \nPower outages are also starting to occur across the southeast, with about 2000 customers losing supply.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:06:04.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
