To get back in the game, he will need the help of an eager young race technician, Cruz Ramirez, with her own plan to win, plus inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet and a few unexpected turns. Proving that #95 isn’t through yet will test the heart of a champion on Piston Cup Racing’s biggest stage! \nCars 3 features the return of Larry the Cable Guy as Mater, Bonnie Hunt as Sally Carrera, and Cheech Marin as Ramone. There’s also some brand new characters, including Jackson Storm (voiced by Armie Hammer) and Cruz Ramirez (voiced by Cristela Alonzo ). They are joined by Kerry Washington, Nathan Fillion and Lea DeLaria. In addition NASCAR’s Jeff Gordon, Richard Petty, Chase Elliott, Ryan Blaney, Daniel Suárez and Bubba Wallace will lend their voices as well. \nCars 3 opens in theaters on Friday, June 16. \nDisney•Pixar ‘s Coco features the voices of Gael García Bernal ( Y Tu Mamá También , The Motorcycle Diaries ), Anthony Gonzalez ( Icebox ), Benjamin Bratt ( Despicable Me 2 , Doctor Strange ) and Renee Victor ( Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones , Confessions of a Shopaholic ). \nDespite his family’s baffling generations-old ban on music, Miguel (voice of newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) dreams of becoming an accomplished musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice of Benjamin Bratt). Desperate to prove his talent, Miguel finds himself in the stunning and colorful Land of the Dead following a mysterious chain of events. Along the way, he meets charming trickster Hector (voice of Gael García Bernal), and together, they set off on an extraordinary journey to unlock the real story behind Miguel’s family history. Character actress Renée Victor also joins the cast as Abuelita, Miguel’s grandmother. \nAnimation for Disney•Pixar’s Coco began back on April 12, 2016, according to a tweet from the director, Toy Story 3 ‘s Lee Unkrich ( Monsters, Inc. , Finding Nemo ). Unkrich spoke about the film and its inspiration, Dia De Los Muertos, back at the D23 Expo in 2015, saying, “I’d seen it portrayed in folk art. It was something about the juxtaposition of skeletons with bright, festive colors that captured my imagination. It has led me down a winding path of discovery. And the more I learn aboutDia De Los Muertos, the more it affects me deeply.” \nUnkrich will direct the film with co-director Adrian Molina ( The Good Dinosaur ), who also wrote the script. Disney•Pixar’s Coco will be released on November 22, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:41:24.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
