Here’s a peek at the menu, which includes several Boston-exclusive items — again, all vegan — that play on a few of the city’s traditional dishes: clam chowder (cauliflower cream, shiitake mushroom, corn, potato, parsley), lobster roll (hearts of palm, celery, smoked paprika, dill), Boston cream whoopie pie (vanilla custard, chocolate ganache), and Boston cream pie Chill (ice cream with vanilla custard, chocolate twist, dark chocolate ganache). By Chloe Menu — Seaport District, Boston by Eater Boston on Scribd This is the largest location for the growing chain, reports Boston Magazine , and while its design is similar to its New York siblings, there’s a hint of Boston — abstract seaweed-patterned wallpaper in the bathroom hallway. (Likewise, the forthcoming Fenway location will have some baseball wallpaper when it opens this spring.) By Chloe will be open in the Seaport from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekends, with brunch service from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends. Keep an eye out for the spring arrival of By Chloe in Fenway as well as in Providence, Rhode Island.
