While a few fast food restaurants are cleaning up their ads, Taco Bell decided to air a commercial that includes foul language. The newest Taco Bell commercial says, “When your morning is hell, just go to Taco Bell.” They should not use the word hell in a jingle. We all know children repeat what they hear.\nTaco Bell’s ‘Morning is hell’ ad is irresponsible and offensive. This inappropriate advertisement is airing during primetime when children are likely watching. It is extremely destructive and damaging to impressionable children viewing the commercial.\nTAKE ACTION: Please contact Taco Bell through our website and ask the company to pull the current ad immediately! Also, encourage Taco Bell to be more responsible in future marketing campaigns. If Taco Bell wants our business, it must no longer use foul language in its ads.\nAnd there you have it.\nWatch the mordantly destructive ad below — if you want to burn forever in hell and destroy all the helpless children: \n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:23:31.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
