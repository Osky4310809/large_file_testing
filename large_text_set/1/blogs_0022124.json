The singer cum host who is all set to enthrall the audience with his hosting skills on Colors' reality show, Rising Star says that it is going to be tough to host a live performance with no retakes. \"It's definitely going to be exciting and challenging for us as hosts and in fact everybody to be a part of a live format show. As hosts, I feel we are going to have the most difficult time and are at risk, but I am also sure that this risk will definitely pay off well,\" said Chang. So how does Chang plans to motivate the nervous contestants, considering he himself has begun his career as a contestant on another singing reality TV show. \"I might not be able to help them much but if I have more time, I'll tell them that it's absolutely okay to be nervous and goof up things. But just be prepared with your best and give every act a fine shot. Considering the younger generation, it's surely going to be distracting for them because of the social media and all the fan attention they get. But I'll definitely ask them to take a leaf out of our senior's experience book and make sure to focus on the art that they have been blessed with. You just make the most of the opportunity.\" As per the ongoing reality shows hosted by popular faces, despite the format and judges being different, one thing that is majorly in common is the fun nok jhok angle between the host and the show's female judge. When we asked Chang over his apparent equation to be seen with his once upon a time GF Monali Thakur, who now is a judge on the show, Chang replied, \"I am still going to pull her leg. When I came to know that Monali was a part of this show since she was the last one to be locked, I was sure that I was going to pull her leg and I am sure she's going to do the same. It's actually become a template that if there's a male anchor and female judge so that flirtatious angle has to build up, it's actually not needed. With us, we still share that comfort level even after whatever history that we had, we are still great friends. And actually, even in real life when we meet we just end up pulling each other's leg. But I don't want to overdo it because she's a judge here. But yes, as the show progresses, there's a lot of fun element that's going to come out in between Monali and me.\" Monali and Chang, a few years ago, were into a steady relationship. But they soon broke hearts of their fans after parting ways stating no compatibility to be the reason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T10:12:18.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
