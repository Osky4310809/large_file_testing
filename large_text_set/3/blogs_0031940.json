When a fire broke out on the ninth floor of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York in 1911, 146 garment workers died—123 of whom were women. In the wake of one of the deadliest workplace tragedies in American history, it was the women of the International Ladies Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU) who worked on the front lines to help mold our modern day workplace. It is also a little-known fact that a woman—Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins—shaped the New Deal and supported the 40-hour work week, a minimum wage, and workers compensation.\nAdvertisement \n\nWomen have been at the front of the labor rights movement since the very beginning. Eva Valesh was a journalist in Minnesota and labor rights activist. She helped organize other Minnesota women who worked in the garment industry, and eventually reported on the working conditions of Minnesota garment workers. In 1888, Eva published an exposé in the St. Paul Globe about how terribly women were being treated in garment factories in the Twin Cities. This piece, along with her activism, helped Minnesotan garment workers win better working conditions, higher pay, and better safety regulations.\nAnd women today are still shaping and invigorating the fight for working people.\nAdvertisement \n\nTake Saru Jayaraman, mother of two and co-founder of Restaurant Opportunity Centers (ROC) United, a group organizing restaurant workers across the country. Saru’s priorities for restaurant workers are the same as those she holds for herself—achieving a work-life balance, for example. This means the ability to work, make enough money to support your children, and also get the flexibility and time you need to be with them when they are sick. That’s why two of ROC’s priorities are paid sick leave and establishing one fair minimum wage (this means eliminating the tipped minimum wage, which currently sits at just $2.13 nationally). In fact, 70 percent of tipped workers in America are women who work at chain restaurants like Olive Garden, Red Lobster, and IHOP.\nOr take Naquasia LeGrand, who helped launch the first fast-food worker’s strike in 2012. With Naquasia’s help, the campaign became known as the “Fight for $15,” and swept the nation with its “take it to the streets” mentality. So far, New York City, Seattle, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and several other cities have increased the minimum wage to $15 an hour. But the Fight for $15 won’t stop there, as thousands of workers are continuing to organize in hundreds of cities.\nAnd finally, there’s the women janitors leading the ¡Ya Basta! (“Enough!”) Movement in California in order to fight sexual harassment and rape in the workplace. These brave women have come forward to share their stories of assault on the job and lead the fight to protect their fellow workers from this kind of violence. Other strong women are joining their cause. California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez has introduced Assembly Bill 1978, which would establish janitorial workforce protections against sexual assault. And working with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), these women have also made sexual assault and rape prevention a centerpiece of contract negotiations now taking place across California. SEIU is headed up nationally by—you guessed it—a woman. Mary Kay Henry became the first women elected to run this national union in 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:55:20.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
