Working with spiritual and occult undertones like much of the group's existing material, the song sound as if it could soundtrack a malevolent engagement with a hypnotist, ushered along all the while by a vocal sample imperiously proclaiming \"I am that bitch.\" \nThe duo told THUMP about the track's origins via email. \"This track was made for a collaborative performance we did with the House of Kenzo in December,\" they said. \"We focused on making club-oriented music for them to perform to, and it fits into a lot of the sets we play.\" \nThe duo shared the track ahead of their upcoming show at Sunnyvale in Brooklyn on February 17, where they'll perform alongside Local Action affiliate LiL JaBBA and APOCALIPSIS founder Riobamba. Last year they launched the MAJ√çA label and shared their debut EP of original productions, Oraciones . \nFollow Alexander on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:42:48.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
