It also drew criticism from players, donors and former coach Jerry Kill, still a wildly popular figure among sports backers in the area, and has put an athletic director who was hired just six months ago right in the pressure cooker as he looks for a replacement. \n“When you’re dealing with somebody that you like in a program that has shown some improvement, you want to say, `Are we sure we’re doing the right thing?'” Johnson said, referring to Claeys. “Which I did. But if you go against the people you’ve hired, they lose confidence in you as well.” Best of 2016 FOX Sports North's Photos of the Year \nJohnson called Claeys, who led the Gophers to 9-4 record in his only full season as coach, “an upstanding man, an honorable person” and said “from a human standpoint, it doesn’t feel very good.” \nBut Coyle pushed for the move after the team threatened to boycott the Holiday Bowl when the university suspended 10 players for their alleged involvement in a case where a woman said multiple players pressured her into having sex. Hennepin County authorities twice declined to press charges citing a lack of evidence, but the school has a lower standard of proof and decided to suspend the players. \nClaeys publicly backed the players’ stand, putting him at odds with Kaler and Coyle. And Coyle said on Tuesday that he made the move “to find a coach that shares that commitment to excellence academically, athletically and socially.” \nJohnson said Coyle cited the program’s poor performance in recruiting rankings and a dwindling season-ticket base as two primary reasons to fire Claeys, though the ticket issue was also due in part to former athletic director Norwood Teague’s decision to drastically increase ticket prices for the 2016 season. \nCurrent players and alumni as notable as former All-American safety Tyrone Carter assailed the decision. And Kill, who was forced to retire in 2015 due to health reasons and handed the job to his longtime assistant Claeys, told 1500 ESPN radio that he was furious with Coyle’s assertion that program was in need of “integrity and class.” \n“I won’t be stepping foot back in the stadium,” Kill said. “And I won’t be stepping back into the university.” \nCoyle said he was aware of some of the hard feelings that his decision has brought on, and he was determined to find a new coach that can help heal the wounds that were opened. \n“I get they’re upset. I get they’re frustrated. I understand that,” Coyle said. “It’s our job to find a leader who will take this program forward and unite all of them in one direction, one goal.” \nThere was also a rally on campus on Wednesday that was initially called earlier in the week to demand the firing of Claeys. But the Star Tribune reported that 75 people turned out to celebrate the decision. \n“Minnesotans love their college football team and they want them to win,” Johnson said. “And that’s fine. But we also expect a high standard of conduct from our student-athletes and all of our students.” \nJohnson was asked if he left the meeting with Coyle believing that firing Claeys was the right move. \n“More so than not,” he said. “I had questions. I had thoughts and feelings about it. If you’re asking me if it was 100 percent one way or another, the answer is no.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T02:13:40.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
