Their 18-year-old daughter was charged with abuse of a corpse. \nThere are no court records indicating whether they have an attorney to speak for them or home telephone listings so they can be contacted. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
