By Robert Purchese   \nNorthern Realms, Nilfgaardian Empire, Scoia'tael, Skellige, Monsters - which do you prefer? Will you rush the table and overwhelm by number, or will you wait and watch, tease and toy? \nWill you win at standalone Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, or will you lose? We've got 10,000 keys to the closed beta - on PC or Xbox One (you play with people on both systems) - to give away so you can find out. EG Gwent Beta Giveaway \nOur giveaway coincides with today's arrival (probably later in the afternoon) of a big Gwent patch introducing the Nilfgaardian deck to the game. The Nilfgaardian deck can reveal opponent's cards, reorder their decks and use disloyal units. More than 60 new cards are being added to the game in all, new cards for other factions among them. \nI previewed Gwent: The Witcher Card Game recently and found it played a much better game of cards than Gwent in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt did. There are so many more mechanics, so many more tactics in play. It's smoother, slicker, faster, and best of all, you don't have to traipse across the game world to find new cards. 2016: A year in review Recommended. \nGood luck getting a key. If you don't, and you signed up for the beta in 2016, then fear ye not for you will be invited in by the end of this week. That is CD Projekt Red confirmed. Deck wipes will also be a thing as the game's testing opens up but there are rewards for long and loyal testers to ease the pain. There's more information on the Gwent: The Witcher Card Game website .
