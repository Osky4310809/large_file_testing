Dunkin' will be releasing several other cold and frozen beverages at the end of March including Dunkin' Energy Punch Powered by Monster Energy, Caramel Shaved Ice Espresso and Fruited Teas. \nFrozen Dunkin' Coffee is made with Dunkin' coffee extract, blended with ice, liquid cane sugar and dairy. Customers can customize the drink in any way they want, adding additional flavors or picking a different dairy mixer. \n\"You just can't have it black,\" said Molly Zimmerman, senior research and development technologist. It took Zimmerman four years to bring frozen coffee to fruition. \nWhile the new Frozen Coffee is billed as a having \"a more authentic, energizing coffee drinking experience\" than its predecessor, not all customers are excited about the change. \nSocial media users took to Twitter on Wednesday to express their displeasure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:09:47.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
