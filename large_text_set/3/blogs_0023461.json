And for curious potential players, Tripwire is holding a 50% off sale and a \"Free Weekend\" promo for Killing Floor 2 on Steam starting Thursday, March 23 at 10:00am Pacific. Folks on PlayStation 4 also have a free trial and a sale (33% off) that's already live.\n[*No less than half the bullets fired in our match were mine, but Zack got 99.8% of the kills.] \nThe Descent Pack [Killing Floor 2]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:02:58.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
