The two were traveling from Montego Bay, Jamaica. Khalilah reportedly showed officers a photo of her with her ex husband, and she was let go. Muhammad Jr. was detained for two hours.\nWhile he was being held, he told the Times , he was asked twice about his religion. A family friend, Chris Mancini called the incident an “outrage,” saying, “I don’t know what is going on with Mr. Trump’s claim that his ban is not religion-based. We do not discriminate in this country based on religion.”\nAccording to Mancini, he has no criminal record and his passport is from the United States.\n[featured image via Wikimedia Commons]\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/muhammad-alis-son-illegally-detained-at-fort-lauderdale-hollywood-international-airport-attorney-says-9164544", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fmuhammad-alis-son-was-reportedly-detained-at-an-airport-asked-whether-hes-muslim%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fmuhammad-alis-son-was-reportedly-detained-at-an-airport-asked-whether-hes-muslim%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Muhammad_Ali_1966-e1487973054343-650x366.jpg&description=Muhammad%20Ali%26%238217%3Bs%20Son%20Was%20Reportedly%20Detained%20at%20an%20Airport%2C%20Asked%20Whether%20He%26%238217%3Bs%20Muslim"], "published": "2017-02-25T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:05:51.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
