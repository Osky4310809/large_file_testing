You love the organised mess, we know. It has the best homely vibes.If you live alone, or with a flat mate, keeping things in place get a bit tough and tricky. You love the organised mess, we know. It has the best homely vibes. \nHowever, problem arises when you have an unexpected guest coming over with whom you may have plans to more than just chill platonically (ahem). Most of us clean up faster in 10 minutes before a guest is coming, than we actually do on a dedicated cleaning up day. Things get slightly crazy when it's a boy, whom you are maybe crushing on, coming to visit. FIRST IMPRESSIONS have to be made, and you almost go in Ninja mode cleaning up and then acting like you were cool all along. 1. You are thrilled about the visit, but only for a second. Because you just realised that you spent Saturday afternoon waxing, and everything is out there perfectly visible to the naked eye. 2. Plus your roommate has hung out her entire's week's laundry on the balcony. That red and black lacy bra needs to be hidden. \n3. You also need better home clothes. PJs with a hole don't suddenly seem all that comfortable. 4. And because you were supposed to spend the whole day at home, your entire stock of lingerie is in the washing machine. Damn! 5. You also realised that your \"I woke up like this\" selfies are far better than the way you look, right now (if only filters were available in real life). 6. You get into Ninja Cleaning Lady mode. Everything goes into that cupboard in the hall. 7. You waste 10 precious minutes convincing your roomie that it's a good idea to put on some pants, and go to the coffee shop... for three hours. \n8. A quick bedroom sweep ensures that all your dirty clothes and Chetan Bhagat books are under the bed. 9. That's the bell. Okay, calm and composed. 10. Oh shit there is a sanitary pad in the bathroom that you rolled up but forgot to bin!
