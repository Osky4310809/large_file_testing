Pictures from President Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009 show many more people on the mall than on Saturday, and WMATA, D.C.'s transport agency, told the Washington Post that 570,557 people took trips Friday compared to 1.1 million trips in 2009.\nNielsen also estimated that about 31 million viewers watched TV coverage of the day — less than Obama and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations.\nNot to mention, Spicer claimed that Trump's inauguration was the first time \"floor coverings\" had been used to protect grass on the National Mall, making empty space more obvious. He was also wrong: Tarps have been used before.\nNow people on the internet have suggestions for some other \"yuge\" inaccurate facts Spicer could share next. Of course, there's already the inevitable Twitter account @SeanSpicerFacts as well as the #SpicerFacts hashtag.\nGuess the number of jelly beans.\nMe: 87\nWife: 134\nSean Spicer: 1.5 million #spicerfacts pic.twitter.com/dq7MmhgG3H\n— Mark Zohar (@markzohar) January 22, 2017\nDonald Trump was the first person to walk on the moon, despite what the dishonest media claims. #SpicerFacts\n— Sean Spicer Facts (@SeanSpicerFacts) January 22, 2017\nA picture of the press secretary mid-briefing proved the meme's most popular incarnation.\nDid you know, for example, that \"you're free to leave the Hotel California whenever you'd like?\" Or, perhaps, that \"Nickleback has sold more records than any band in history.
