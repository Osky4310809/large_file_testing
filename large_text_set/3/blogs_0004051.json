The Guardian and Telegraph both reported that Sanchez stormed out of a training session during the week and then clashed with teammates in the dressing room. \nSanchez's future at the club had already been in serious doubt as he has refused to sign a contract extension, and the fallout with Wenger only increases the likelihood of the Chilean leaving the club this summer. \nIt's the latest blow for the Gunners, which comes on the heels of big losses to Chelsea in the Premier League and Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Alexis Sanchez did not start in Arsenal's 3-1 defeat at Liverpool on Saturday. \nThe 5-1 loss in Munich is said to have contributed to Sanchez becoming increasingly agitated with his teammates, and Wenger in turn becoming frustrated with the forward's attitude. \nSanchez is Arsenal's leading scorer this season with 17 goals and nine assists in the league, but has often let his frustrations show on the pitch after disappointing results. \nFellow star Mesut Ozil missed the Liverpool game with an illness, and the German's future is also in doubt as he is in the same contractual situation as Sanchez. Arsenal play Bayern in the second leg of their round-of-16 tie at the Emirates on Tuesday. \nMattias is ESPN FC's Arsenal correspondent.
