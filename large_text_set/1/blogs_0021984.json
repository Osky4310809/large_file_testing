Shaq threw out to Barkley that he knows nothing about winning back-to-back rings, and things got a little loud in the studio: The TNT crew has a heated discussion surrounding LeBron James' recent comments üòÅ pic.twitter.com/YbsmP8LWxP ‚Äî NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) January 27, 2017 \nBarkley added this: \n\"This ain't like a 7-Eleven you can just go in and buy anything. They're trying to make trades ‚Ä¶ they've got the highest payroll in the league, they're paying $40-50 million in luxury taxes.\" \nUltimately, the entire group seemed to agree James going public was the wrong approach, but LeBron is a sensitive subject even after winning a ring in an incredible comeback effort.
