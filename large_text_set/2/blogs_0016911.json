We started with our newest readers on Snapchat, and plan to roll it out on our other platforms in the coming weeks.” \nStill, the new slogan provoked some chuckles on social media from those who found it somewhat overwrought. Wow the new Post logo is bleak but I’m digging it. pic.twitter.com/ZSTIrhZB8f", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:35:20.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
