There’s two main things going on today so far, one of them, handily, in the morning, and the other taking up the rest of the day. \nTo the latter event first, it’s another day of debate in the Commons for the government’s bill allowing ministers to trigger article 50 and thus begin the formal process of Brexit. This week there are three days scheduled to cover the third reading and committee stages. \nThis is the period when amendments are debated, and there are many dozens of them tabled. Today is more focused on amendments connected to process, with the more fundamental ones – notably on the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and whether parliament gets a final say over the eventual Brexit deal – coming tomorrow. \nBut today should see signs of whether any Conservative MPs are mustering a rebellion on either of those issues, especially now the government has indicated it is not minded to back down unilaterally. PM 'unlikely to change terms' of parliament vote on final Brexit deal Read more \nBefore all that, Theresa May is due to host the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , at Downing street for a morning meeting and working lunch. \nAfter Donald Trump and the Turkish PM, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Netanyahu is the third somewhat divisive world leader May will have met in little more than a week. Expect some occasionally tense talk focused on Iran and on new Israeli settlement building. Benjamin Netanyahu to press Theresa May for tougher line on Iran Read more \nDon’t, however, expect a press conference, as there is not one planned. This is becoming something of a habit for May, who also dodged the media almost entirely at Friday’s EU summit in Malta. \nDo comment below, and I’ll look out as best I can.
