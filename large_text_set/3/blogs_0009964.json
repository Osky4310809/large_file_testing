It's just about playing football.\" \nShe says she saw a clear demand for the sport in Scotland. The task now is to try to spread out across the country. \nIn among the men on the pitch is one woman. In fact, she is the only woman playing in the amputee football league in the UK. \n\"All amputees are used to being the odd one out in the crowd,\" Rebecca Sellar explains. \n\"So coming into this as the only woman, you get on with it and over it.\" \nShe would like to get more women involved. \nRebecca says that since she started she has been welcomed into the game and on a personal level has gained fitness as well as the enjoyment of taking part in a team sport. \nShe says: \"Our numbers are growing and the more word we can get out there to encourage people to get involved the better we can have it as a sport for Scotland.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T07:38:06.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
