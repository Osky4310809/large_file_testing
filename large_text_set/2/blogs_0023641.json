Upjohn's 11 grandchildren, will be celebrated today during a memorial service at the Gilmore Car Museum. She died Monday, Feb. 20 at the age of 91 from complications of heart disease. \nParfet's generosity is one of the reasons Kalamazoo is known as a city of givers. \nThe granddaughter of both the founder of The Upjohn Co. and historic Gilmore Bros. Department Store, her family's story is inexorably tied to the history of Kalamazoo and its legacy will be felt for many years. Mark Bugnaski | MLive.com Memoirs chronicle family history \nIn 2015, Parfet released a two-volume book on her family's history, titled \"Keep the Quality Up,\" after a long-held Upjohn Co. motto. It chronicles the stories of two of Kalamazoo's most renowned families, the Gilmores and the Upjohns. \nIn her memoirs, Parfet wrote that W.E. Upjohn wasn't just a very successful capitalist. He also held \"socialist\" ideas, according to Mary Corcoran, who helped Martha Parfet with the research and writing for the book project. \n\"He had a wonderful quote about believing God had given him this great wealth, but that he was just a steward of the wealth to see it disbursed and used for everybody responsibly,\" Corcoran said at the time of the book release.

Upjohn founded the Upjohn Co . in Kalamazoo in 1886. Upjohn invented the \"friable pill,\" which meant it was easily crushed to a powder, to compete with the bitter and insoluble pills at the time. W.E. Upjohn served as president of Upjohn for nearly 40 years. He was known as \"Kalamazoo's First Citizen\" and his death in 1932 left the community in mourning. \nUpjohn merged with Pharmacia in 1995. It's now a part of Pfizer.

Upjohn M.D. Campus of the Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine \nThe Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine's W.E. Upjohn Campus opened in 2014. \nThe medical school building was donated by William U. Parfet, CEO of MPI Research. He is the great-grandson of Upjohn Co. founder W.E. Upjohn, after whom the campus is named. William Johnston and Ronda Stryker, granddaughter of the school's namesake, donated $100 million to make the school possible. \nW.E. Upjohn has another connection to health care in Kalamazoo. He directed the construction of Bronson Hospital, now Bronson Methodist Hospital, in 1904.
