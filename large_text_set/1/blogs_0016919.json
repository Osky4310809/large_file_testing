Great seasons Pittsburgh and Green Bay! \nONTO THE FALCONS! dispozblcopy says: Jan 22, 2017 9:48 PM \nIn terms of the Steelers‚Äô ‚Äúkiller Bs‚Äù, someone did some research into ‚Äútriplet‚Äù teams ‚Äî teams that have an elite qb, and lights out rb and wideouts. According to this guy on PatsPulpit, BB has faced five of them over the years, including the ‚ÄúGreatest Show on Turf‚Äù‚Äî Warner, Bruce, Faulk, and Manning, James, Harrison, and so on. BB‚Äôs record against stacked ‚Äútriplet‚Äù teams was 5-0, now 6-0. Falconies coming up. \nDiscarding the first half of the season, seems reasonable to assert that two very deserving and top-drawer teams will be facing off in the SB. \nOne storyline is that TB12, he of the huge CHIP on his shoulder and on a revenge tour to boot, will walk into the Houston stadium knowing that the NFL just hung the MVP award on the guy on the other sideline. Tens of millions of people get to tune into seeing his response. \nCan‚Äôt wait. Jan 22, 2017 9:48 PM \nLet the hate begin!
