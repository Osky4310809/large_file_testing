Harassment: The man starts taking a picture as she waits at the crossing (Shiver Productions ) \nWhen Ms Hefter confronts him, he insists he is allowed to take photos of whatever he wants. \nAnd when she asks him to delete the picture, he responds: “If you ask me with a smile, I will do it.” \nShe said the incident left her feeling \"violated.\" \nHarassment Uncovered – Tonight, which airs at 7.30pm tonight, discovered that more than half of women in London had been sexually harassed by strangers on the streets or in public spaces. Harrassment Uncovered - Tonight - ITV - Woman is harrassed on street \nOf the 513 18 to 34-year-old women questioned, 53.5 per cent said they had suffered verbal or physical abuse in public and 56.7 per cent admitted to experiencing it in one of London’s bars or clubs. \nAnd more than half these women said the harassment they were subject to has left them in fear of violence – or even led to a violent situation. \nThe investigation comes after British Transport Police saw almost 900 reports of sexual crimes in the last across London’s Tube network – an increase of 20 per cent from the previous year. Confrontation: The man insists he can take pictures of whoever he wishes (Shiver Productions ) \nIt is running a campaign, alongside Transport for London, to encourage people to report such incidents. \nBut still 41 per cent of women fear for their safety after being heckled or harassed in London. \nMs Hefter walked around the capital for four hours and, during that time, endured comments about her appearance and lingering looks and stares. Sexual harassment: Ms Hefter said she had been catcalled and followed home in the past (Shiver Productions ) \nShe said she has suffered from sexual harassment in the past, which has even led to men following her while walking home. \n“I must’ve been 15 or 16 coming home from college and a guy on a bike stopped and touched me and from then to now it could be as little as a beep in a car to men even following me,\" she said. Grieving mother of Oliver Dearlove hits out at women who 'walked away' \nReferring to the man who took a photos of her on the street, she added: “The idea of how he thought it was okay to do that, the entitlement, is just beyond belief. I felt quite violated by it.” \nRachel Krys of the End Violence Against Women Coalition said: “Sexual harassment is not a come on, it’s not a precursor to a relationship, it’s about men controlling what women do and wanting to stop women being free to walk down the streets, to just take the space that they’re entitled to. \n“It’s about saying, ‘I’m in control of this space, I’m in control of you, I have a right to comment on your body, to comment on what you’re wearing.’ \n“And so it’s a really important issue that we need to challenge, and it’s the men we need to challenge, and we need to stop the perpetrators harassing women in the street.” \nHarassment Uncovered - Tonight is on ITV at 7.30pm on Thursday.
