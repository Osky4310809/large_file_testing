Rose says the U2 guys were in pursuit of a new sound, listening to new music, including his own. \nThe lawsuit reads: \"Although perhaps the most popular rock band in the world in the 1980s, by that decade's end the band felt in need of reinvigoration.\" \nA report from NY Post reads: \"Rose's lawyer, Thomas Mullaney, said his client is only coming forward now - some 26 years later - because he was just starting out at the time of the alleged theft and he didn't want it to ruin his career. \n\"Rose also only recently found an ex-Island Records employee who will corroborate his story, including that 'Nae Slappin' was often played at Island records when U2 was looking for inspiration of 'Achtung Baby,' Mullaney said.\" \nYou can take a listen to the two tunes below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:43:54.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
