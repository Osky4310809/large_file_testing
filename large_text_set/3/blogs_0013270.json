By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 18, 2017 10:08 AM Venkaiah Naidu says that Rahul Gandhi has been running Congress for last 10 years. (Source: ANI/Twitter) \nUnion Minister of Urban Development, Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation and Information and Broadcasting, Venkaiah Naidu has once again fired shots at the Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi by saying he has been running the party for last 10 years while Sonia Gandhi is the President only for namesake. Naidu’s comments have come after Congress lost the 2017 assembly elections by a huge margin in Uttar Pradesh. It could win only 7 seats independently in the state which was even less than Apna Dal’s 9 seats. Congress also failed to form governments in Goa and Manipur despite finishing as the single largest party and since then many leaders have raised fingers at the party leadership. \nGoa MLA Vishwajit Rane and party member Savio Rodrigues gave their resignation after BJP -led government took charge of the state. “Sonia Gandhi president for namesake, Rahul Gandhi is running the party,” Venkaiah Naidu. Speaking about the appointment of new Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister he said nothing has been finalised yet and the final decision will be taken after the MLA meeting on Saturday evening. \nYou may also want to watch: \nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will hold its legislature meet today to elect the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in Lucknow. All MLAs will meet at 5 p.m. to pick the next Chief Minister of the state. Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu and BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav will also be present at the meeting as party’s central observers. The swearing-in ceremony of the new Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister will be held at the Kanshiram memorial ground tomorrow. \nPrime Minister Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah will also attend the ceremony. The BJP marked an astounding victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections by winning 324 seats out of 403, thus dislodging the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) from power. \n(with input from agency)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T07:00:12.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
