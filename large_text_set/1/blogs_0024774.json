Reportedly the two actors made jokes on the set of the drama, raising the energy level all around, and exchanged hand warmers in the cold weather. \nOn January 20, the two actors filmed a scene in which Chae Soo Bin slaps Yoon Kyun Sang across the face, but the atmosphere on set remained full of smiles and laughter. Yoon Kyun Sang also took care of Chae Soo Bin when she had to film outside on a mountainside in her thin hanbok [traditional Korean clothing]. \nTheir chemistry was apparent even at the press conference for “Rebel Hong Gil Dong,” with Chae Soo Bin describing her co-star as “someone who makes everyone around him feel comfortable” and Yoon Kyun Sang saying, “Thanks to the lovely Chae Soo Bin, I’m able to enjoy the filming.” \n“Rebel Hong Gil Dong” will premiere on January 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:54:08.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
