I’ve heard gun shots. I’ve seen people get shot at. I’ve seen it all,” Zorian Flowers tells CBS 2’s Audrina Bigos. \nAnd he’s dealt with loss — his own brother killed at 27. But his eyes stayed on the prize. \n“It took me almost a year and a half a half to finish my West Point application,” Zorian says. \nThat turned out well for the water polo competitor. It all makes his mother proud. \n“He said, ‘Mom, you will never have to struggle again. I’m going to succeed in life to make sure I take care of you,’” Zalinka Bunch says. \nZorian says he’s excited to attend the prestigious and historic military school. But his heart will always be in Chicago. \n“I want to show people in this neighborhood that there’s something out there better for them,” he says. \nAudrina Bigos Audrina Bigos is a general assignment reporter for CBS 2 A multi-media journalist and educator, Bigos previously worked for WCCB-TV in Charlotte, N.C. since 2011.
