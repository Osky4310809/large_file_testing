So I'm just making sure I'm doing the right things - cryotherapy, massage, eating the right things, trying to turn vegan. After scoring on his return to the England team, Sunderland forward Jermain Defoe feels he could play his way into Gareth Southgate's World Cup plans \n\"That's a funny one because when I go to my mum's she's got every kind of meat you can imagine out on the table. \n\"It was my girlfriend's idea. She said to me, 'You've got to do it' and she's always showing me these documentaries and that. It's always nice to have someone around you to who helps you and drives you on and wants you to do well.\" \nDefoe happily embraces every marginal gain he can get his hands on, a function of his professionalism and a lingering hunger for putting the ball in the back of the net. \n\"I don't find anything hard because I know the feeling of scoring goals,\" he said. \n\"So getting in an ice bath and all that isn't nice, but I just think, 'You know what? I'm going to do this and be rewarded'. It's hard, but in another way it's easy because all I want to do is play well and score goals. \n\"The key thing for me is recovery, giving yourself the best opportunity to perform in the next game, and I seem to have got that to a tee. There's a lot of things I do away from training and away from matchday that help me perform, so I'll just keep doing that.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:44:00.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
