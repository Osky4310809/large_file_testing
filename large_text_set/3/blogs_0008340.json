Over the last few years, creations like unicorn toast , rainbow bagels , and galaxy pastries became viral sensations. And now, a food stylist named Adeline Waugh is giving Instagram a new dish to obsess over . Say hello to mermaid toast : A post shared by Adeline Waugh (@vibrantandpure) on Mar 7, 2017 at 8:44am PST The colorful spread is a mixture of blue-green algae powders and almond milk cream cheese, and it looks like Waugh added some flecks of gold leaf for an extra bit of visual pop. This morning, the food stylist offered a bit of an explanation as to why she created this unusual toast: I am just having fun! I am a food stylist and I like to create beautiful things using food — I’ve never claimed to be starting a trend or a putting out a new recipe that is super practical — it's 100% impractical, I just like to play around in the kitchen and attempt to create something aesthetically pleasing and unique from time to time. Also, I don't know about you, but with everything going on in the world today, sometimes I just want to look at some colorful food. Like many popular viral foodstuffs, mermaid toast’s appeal is entirely visual, so it’s nice that Waugh is pointing out that she’s just trying to make something that looks good, regardless of how it tastes.
