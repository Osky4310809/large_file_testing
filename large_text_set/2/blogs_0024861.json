It is amazing. I am here with my mom…It is a beautiful and special moment and I am absorbing it now.” \nDev looked daper in a white Burberry tuxedo, while his mother looked elegant in a black sari and added a touch of bling with gold work on it. With her hair tied up in a bun, Dev’s mother opted to go for minimalistic with just long earrings to finish up her look. \n“Lion”, based on Saroo Brierley’s best-selling autobiography “A Long Way Home”, is a true story about an Indian boy who falls asleep on a train only to wake up and realise he is miles away from home in a strange land where he does not speak the language. \nHe experiences many challenges before getting adopted by a couple in Australia. Years later, he sets out to find his lost family. \nHe also said that with the role he had to “kind of battle my own resume” and convince people that he could disappear, change skin and be accepted as Saroo. \nDev also had his eight-year-old “Lion” co-star Sunny Pawar at the red carpet. \nTalking about Sunny, Dev said: “He was icing on top and beautiful to work with him.” \nDev also won a BAFTA Award for the Best Supporting Actor for his performance in “Lion” earlier this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:57:57.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
