In a video on Manny's channel, the two got together for a reveal. We knew that the collab would include some liquid lipsticks and a highlighter, but we know what the shades inside are. \nAs you know, the packaging (including the boxes, compact, and tube) is black, and this is a first for Jeffree's range. The accent is holographic, which is so hot right now. We're particularly enamored that both Jeffree and Manny's signature logos — a star and a moon, respectively — are on every aspect of the products, including the sticker on the back of the highlighter compact and pressed into the powder itself. \nThe collection officially launches at 10 a.m. PT on April 8, and you'll be able to purchase all three items in a bundle for $50. However, if you'd rather buy items one piece at a time, the liquid lipsticks will cost $18 and the Skin Frost will be $29. In another first, Jeffree is allowing the use of a discount code on his website. Enter MANNYMUA at checkout and you'll be able to get 10 percent off individual items from the collaboration. \nWatch the video above to see the products in action, then keep reading to see the products themselves and swatches of each shade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T04:00:23.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
