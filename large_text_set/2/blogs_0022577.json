Fireball Roberts, 1962 \nRoberts drove the No. 22 Jim Stephens-owned Pontiac to victory in his qualifying race for the third consecutive year in 1962. \nBut this time, Roberts was able to notch a Daytona 500 win a couple days later. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images Cale Yarborough, 1977 and 1984 \nThe three-time Cup champion is the only driver to accomplish this twice. \nOf his four Daytona 500 victories, Yarborough preluded it with a qualifying race win in 1977 and 1984. Bill Elliott, 1985 \nElliott had a wildly successful Speedweeks in 1985, winning the Daytona 500 with a then-record speed of 205.114 miles per hour in his No. 9 Melling Racing Ford Thunderbird. \n“Awesome Bill” backed it up with a win in his qualifying race, followed by his first of two victories in the Great American Race. Focus on Sport/Getty Images Focus On Sport Bobby Allison, 1988 \nAllison scored a victory in his qualifying race before winning the 1987 Daytona 500 in the iconic No. 12 Stavola Brothers Racing Buick, the final win of his illustrious career.

RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images Dale Earnhardt Jr., 2004 \nIn 2004, the two-time Daytona 500 champoin won a qualifying race for the first time, and rolled into Victory Lane for first time in the Great American Race. \nAfter putting his No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet on the outside pole for this year’s Daytona 500, he has a strong enough car to do it again as he returns to Cup competition. Matt Kenseth, 2012 \nKenseth scored his second Daytona 500 victory in the No. 17 Roush Fenway Racing Ford in 2012, but he also won his first of two career Duel qualifying races a few days before. \nHe joins Earnhardt Jr. as the only two active drivers to have accomplished this feat. © LAT South LAT Photo USA LAT South", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:45:37.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
