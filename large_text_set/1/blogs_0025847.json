Photo: Caviar \nStill looking for the perfect gift for Valentines Day? In the year 2017, nothing says I love you more than a set of matching custom gold iPhones with engravings of US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nThe modified iPhone 7 designs were created by the Russian company Caviar which makes luxury smartphones only someone like Donald Trump would want to buy. Caviar created another customized iPhone bearing Trump’s face after he won the general election last year. It also created a Putin iPhone two years ago. \nTo celebrate the bromance of Donald and Vladamir, Caviar created a unique gift box that cradles the iPhones so that the face of the leaders are fixed on each other in a romantic gaze. Caviar is calling the exclusive packed “One World” and says its a symbol of the beginning of a new stage in Russian – American relations. \nThe back of the phones features words from the national anthems for Russia and the USA. You can pick up the set of gold iPhones for around $6,500 . Or you can buy the phones separately along with the gold-plated charging station.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:30:34.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
