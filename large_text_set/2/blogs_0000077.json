If none of the switches you can lay hands on are to your liking, you can modify them. The inner workings of a mechanical switch are fairly simple. Some common mods include opening a switch to apply lube and swapping the stems and springs to create hybrids. For instance, adding the clicky stem from an Aristotle to a Zealio housing gets you a super-smooth and clicky switch dubbed a \"Zealiostotle.\" \nIf this all sounds a bit tedious, you're right on the money. Imagine doing this for dozens of switches. But it's a labor of love that can get you exactly the right key feeling. \nIf this all sounds a bit tedious, you're right on the money... but it's a labor of love. Artisan keycaps \nIf you thought spending hundreds of dollars on a full keyset was extravagant, that's nothing compared to artisan keycaps. These are essentially little sculptures for your keyboard that you can attach in place of a regular keycapâ€”probably one you don't use constantly like escape, F-something, or print. These hand-made caps are usually resin casts with colorways designed to match popular keysets. There are artisans that look like robots, monsters, tortoises, blowfish, skulls, gems, and so much more. \nBecause they're all hand-made, the supply of artisan caps vastly outstrips demand. That means you have to join raffles to win the chance to buy a cap from the maker, usually for $20-50 each. While that seems like a lot for a keycap, you have to remember some of these caps are genuinely beautiful art and there are only a few of them in the entire world. Hand-made keycaps. \nThings get crazy when you try to obtain them after missing out on a raffle. Owners of rare caps often won't even sell them for money. You have to trade for other rare artisan caps. If you do find someone willing to accept cash, you'll pay several times the original price. For example, the popular BroBot v2 commonly sells for $200-300 per cap. It's even more for a Clack Factory Skull. \"Our community is growing everyday, and growing fast. The artisans can't possibly keep up with the demand without automation by implementing manufacturing process,\" MiTo told me. \nPeople care deeply about art of all sorts, and artisan keycaps are no different. Madness or magnificence? \nSpending hundreds of dollars customizing a keyboard seems bizarre at first glance, but think about some of the things gamers and other computer enthusiasts already do. We spend $500 on video cards, deck out PC cases with custom lighting or water cooling, and buy monitors that are nicer than our TVs. Sometimes you go all-in on a theme. \nPursuing the perfect keyboard is about the typing experience as well as aesthetics. It does look bonkers at first, but as Zeal pointed out to me, that's how things are when you're on the outside looking in: \"Any unfamiliar hobby will always look crazy or weird. There are other hobbies that seem weirder such as collecting of plastic outdoor chairs or . That said, it wouldn't be fair for anyone to judge those hobbies from the outside as we haven't fully experienced what those hobbies have to offer.\" \nKeep an eye out for my expose on the dangerous world of vintage washing machine collecting.
