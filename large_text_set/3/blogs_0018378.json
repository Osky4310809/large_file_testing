The HIV-preventive medicine is a daily pill taken orally with a \"clear potential\" to reduce the spread of the virus responsible for more than a million deaths in 2015 alone, the report said. \nRead: The Cure For All Disease?

Meanwhile, the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group will begin researching whether PrEP is a cost-effective prescription drug to introduce to the national market. \nPeople gathered around lit candles in the shape of a ribbon during a HIV/AIDS awareness campaign ahead of World Aids Day, in Kathmandu, Nepal Nov. 30, 2016.
