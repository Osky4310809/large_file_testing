What is the Alt Right?: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published Updated 7:25 pm EST, November 17, 2016 17 Comments By Jessica McBride 12.1k Alt Right leader and white nationalist Richard Spencer. (YouTube) \nThe term “Alt Right” has been under increasing scrutiny since Donald Trump was named president-elect. \nWhat is the Alt Right? The term is shortened from “alternative right,” and it’s associated with white nationalism, leading to a growing chorus of concern because Trump’s new White House strategist, Steve Bannon , is a well-known Alt Right-affiliated Internet provocateur. \nThe term has been defined as “a loosely organized group that espouses white nationalism” and “emerged as a counterpoint to mainstream conservatism.” Alt Righters – often young white male intellectuals who are wired into social media – have repackaged white supremacy into what they label a white identity movement. Considered racist by those who monitor hate groups, Alt Righters rail against traditional Republicanism, express support for Trump, and trash multiculturalism, political correctness, and globalism. \nThe Anti Defamation League says the Alt Right pits itself against “establishment” conservatism, writing, “People who identify with the Alt Right regard mainstream or traditional conservatives as weak and impotent, largely because they do not sufficiently support racism and anti-Semitism. ” \nHere’s what you need to know: 1. The Alt Right Is Associated With Anti-Semitism, Masculinity, Opposition to Multiculturalism & White Nationalism On Monday, Donald Trump announced that Steve Bannon had been appointed as a senior adviser. Bannon is the former head of Breitbart News, a far-right website known for racist and anti-Semitic articles. His hiring was praised by white nationalists, denounced by Democrats, and met with silence from Republican lawmakers. (Getty) \nThe Los Angeles Times defines the Alt Right as “a far-right ideology that promotes what many consider to be white nationalism, racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia and misogyny.” \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center says the Alt Right blends many ideologies: “At the heart of the Alt-Right is a break with establishment conservatism that favors experimentation with the ideas of the French New Right; libertarian thought as exemplified by former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas); anarcho-capitalism, which advocates individual sovereignty and open markets in place of an organized state; Catholic traditionalism, which seeks a return to Roman Catholicism before the liberalizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council; and other ideologies.” \nThe Anti-Defamation League defines the Alt Right as “a range of people on the extreme right who reject mainstream conservatism in favor of forms of conservatism that embrace implicit or explicit racism or white supremacy.” \nSome in the Alt Right are white nationalists who “want to preserve the white majority in the U.S., claiming that whites losing their majority status is equivalent to ‘white genocide,'” says the Anti-Defamation League. \nAccording to the Anti Defamation League, “a number of Alt Righters are also blatantly anti-Semitic and blame Jews for allegedly promoting anti-white policies such as immigration and diversity.” 2. The Alt Right Grew Out of the Internet Culture and that concludes our intensive three-week course pic.twitter.com/cCJp8sav7a \n— Peter Bowden (@petercbowden) November 16, 2016 \nBreitbart, the website affiliated with Alt Right views formerly run by Donald Trump’s White House strategist Steve Bannon, has a page explaining the alt right from its perspective. Alt Righters deny they are racist. “The alt-right is a movement born out of the youthful, subversive, underground edges of the internet. 4chan and 8chan are hubs of alt-right activity,” wrote Breitbart. \nHowever, even the article acknowledges that a group known as the “1488” exist within the Alt Right circles, saying it’s a “reference to two well-known Neo Nazi slogans,” adding that others in the Alt Right movement don’t like this group. The article continues, “The current consensus offers, at best, mild condemnation of identity politics on the Left, and zero tolerance for identity politics on the right.” \nBecause of its origins in Internet culture, memes are important in Alt Right circles. \nThe Alt Right’s adherents also unite over opposition to political correctness. Mother Jones said adherents tend to be young white males who rail against “traditional movement conservatism,” especially on immigration and globalism. \nThe Alt Right’s numbers are not known, but some Alt Righters on Twitter have used the medium to harass people of Jewish descent, said CBS. 3. Some Groups Classify the Alt Right as a Loosely Organized Hate Group & The Alt Right Has Its Own Code Words US President-elect Donald Trump has supporters among the Alt Right. (Getty) \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center describes the Alt Right as “a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that ‘white identity’ is under attack by multicultural forces using ‘political correctness’ and ‘social justice’ to undermine white people and ‘their’ civilization.” \nThe SPLC says the Alt Right is “characterized by heavy use of social media and online memes, Alt-Righters eschew ‘establishment’ conservatism, skew young, and embrace white ethno-nationalism as a fundamental value.” \nAlt Righters are known for using euphemisms or code words to make the accusations of racism tougher. \nThe Anti-Defamation League says the Alt Right likes “to try to use terms such as ‘culture’ as substitutes for more lightning rod terms such as ‘race,’ or promote ‘Western Civilization’ as a code word for white culture or identity.” \nAlt Right circles have popularized their own vocabulary. For example, they use the word “cuckservative,” to refer to, in their minds, cuckolded conservatives who “pro­mote the inter­ests of Jews and non-whites over those of whites.” \nThe Alt Right split with mainstream Republicanism starting with President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq, and they are also “suspicious of free markets” because they are most concerned with “cultural preservation and homogeneity,” NPR said. \nTrump earned controversy when he retweeted a Star of David, which originated on Alt Right websites. 4. Trump’s New White House Adviser is a Member of the Alt Right & the Alt Right Has Embraced Trump Trump campaign CEO and former executive chairman of Breitbart News Steve Bannon arrives for a Wisconsin rally. (Getty) \nThe Los Angeles Times says former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon was quoted as saying he turned the website into “go-to platform of the alt-right.” Trump has elevated Bannon to a key position as White House strategist. According to Mother Jones , Bannon said of Breitbart in July, “We’re the platform for the alt-right.” The Bannon appointment has been hotly criticized as bringing racism into the White House. \nThe Alt Right has embraced Trump’s candidacy, and Hillary Clinton attempted to connect Trump to the Alt Right movement during the campaign. Glenn Beck called the movement “terrifying” and said Bannon gave a voice to it at Breitbart. Those who once worked at Breitbart said its founder had despised racism, but Bannon moved the site more toward the Alt Right after taking it over, said Mother Jones. \nRichard Spencer, the founder of the Alt Right name, applauded Trump’s election, telling The Dallas Morning News that his election “is the first step, the first stage towards identity politics for white people.” The newspaper said Alt Right members regard Trump as an “alt-right hero.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T03:40:47.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
