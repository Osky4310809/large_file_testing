They eventually worked space for Senatla to go over under the posts for his record breaking try. \nSenatla 180th try in the HSBC Sevens World Series saw him break Fabian Juries' record for South Africa. \nBranco du Preez converted for the Blitzboks to lead 7-5 at half-time. \nThe Blitzboks extended their lead two minutes into the second half with Rosco Specman getting over under the poles for a converted try after more excellent work from Justin Geduld and Senatla. \nRuhan Nel then scored a third to extend the lead to 19-5 after he cut inside two Fijian defenders and then used his strength to get over the line. \nNel put the game beyond doubt after an excellent breakout by the Blitzboks, scoring under the posts without a Fijian defender near him. \nAfter conceding just 4 tries in the whole tournament, South Africa certainly deserve the title in Wellington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T10:22:30.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
