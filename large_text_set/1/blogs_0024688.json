Poor bloke never stood a chance\". \nBut fans weren't happy that after all the build up of drama, it was just the poor bus driver who snuffed it. \nWhen one person tweeted: \"i bet none of the major characters die\", another fan replied: \"wasn't even a minor character it was just the bus driver lmao\" The driver was taken away in a body bag (Photo: BBC) \nAnother posted: \"I feel like there was too much emphasis on that body bag for it to have just been the bus driver...\" \n\"All that in eastenders and the bus driverthat no one cares about died,\" said another. \nOne fan wrote: \"i got so excited over who was dead but i bet it was the bloody bus driver, why does eastenders do this to me\" Fans were upset that \"just\" the driver died (Photo: BBC) \nAnother sarcastically commented: \"'omg who died omg' the bus driver died you f**kwits\". \nOn Tuesday night's episode, the fallout from the accident was shown on screen as everyone started to figure out what to do next as they begin to hunt for friends and family, and save them from the rubble. \nHowever, viewers watching at home were quick to suggest that it seemed the poor bus driver - who appeared to suffer a heart attack at the wheel, leading to the crash - had been forgotten by other characters, although there is still more to come.
