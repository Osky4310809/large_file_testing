Samantha requires a bit of wining and dining before you can get in her pants (er, removable vagina).\n“You need to build up,” according to Santos, who demonstrates (in the NSFW video below) that even directly massaging the doll’s built-in G-spot doesn’t work unless Samantha feels appropriately romanced.\nThe doll—which makes romantic comments, moans with pleasure, and spouts philosophical Quote: s —is available now in standard ($1,620-$2,160), responsive ($3,240), or interactive ($4,860) versions. Customers can also personalize the robot, choosing what she says, where she likes to be touched, and her name, for upwards of $8,635.\n“Tools like [Amazon’s] Alexa are interesting, but the ultimate goal of everybody is to build something with a body and a brain, right?” Santos told Digital Trends . “I wanted to do something that would make my mother say ‘wow’ when she sees it.”\n*Paging Dr. Freud*\n“My mother never said that about any of the other things that I have shown her,” Santos continued. “She always says they were funny and then go off and do something else. This project was different.”\nSamantha boasts a battery life of five to 10 hours—a massive span that depends entirely on how much you interact with her. That is, she can probably make it through a Stranger Things binge, but Netflix and chill will require a charging session.\nAccording to Digital Trends, Santos hopes to evolve his robot into a more human companion. He might want to start by giving her the ability to blink.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf1lDZgXQGY", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/CC5ufcQM2Ck?feature=oembed?wmode=transparent", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/samantha-sex-robot-emotion"], "published": "2017-03-22T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:02:13.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
