All 79 of his major league plate appearances came with Philadelphia, which designated him for assignment June 2 after he hit .239/.342/.313 there and .270/.331/.365 in 139 PAs with its Triple-A affiliate. Lough also struggled with Miami’s Triple-A club, albeit over a mere 32 PAs, with a .200/.226/.267 line. \nIn 820 trips to the plate with the Royals, Orioles and Phillies, the lefty-swinging Lough has batted .254/.300/.371 while garnering time at all three outfield spots. Detroit has two proven corner outfielders in Justin Upton and J.D. Martinez , but its only center field options – Tyler Collins , Mikie Mahtook , JaCoby Jones and Anthony Gose – haven’t established themselves. Neither has corner outfield reserve Steven Moya , so Lough could perhaps find his way to the Tigers’ bench at some point this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:50:49.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
