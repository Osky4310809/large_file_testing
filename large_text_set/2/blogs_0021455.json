"persons": [], "text": "Jemal Countess/Getty Images Like us on Facebook \nSome filmmakers spend their whole careers trying to nab one of the Academy's five annual \"Best Director\" nomination slots. But in some rare cases, a director's debut film will make such a lasting and deep impression that the Academy of Arts and Sciences takes notice. Here are 21 directors who were nominated for an Oscar for their first efforts. 1. ORSON WELLES // CITIZEN KANE (1941) \nOften considered the greatest movie of all time, Citizen Kane was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1942 — including one for Best Director for its director (and star and writer) Orson Welles— but only won a single award for its original screenplay. While Welles was one of the youngest filmmakers to receive a directing nomination at the age of 26, the prestigious award went to John Ford for the film How Green Was My Valley . 2. DELBERT MANN // MARTY (1955) \nIn 1955, first-time feature film director Delbert Mann and screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky made the film adaptation of the teleplay Marty (which the pair had also collaborated on two years earlier). The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Actor for Ernest Borgnine, and earned a win for Chayefsky’s screenplay and Mann’s direction. 3. SIDNEY LUMET // 12 ANGRY MEN (1957) \nAt 33, Sidney Lumet was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for his debut feature film, 12 Angry Men .

JACK CLAYTON // ROOM AT THE TOP (1959) \nIn 1959, British director Jack Clayton received international critical acclaim for the harsh indictment of the British class system he depicted in Room at the Top . Based on author John Braine’s novel of the same name, the black-and-white film earned six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director. Interestingly, Hermione Baddeley’s supporting performance as Elspeth in Room at the Top holds the record for shortest performance to be nominated for an Academy Award, clocking in at only 2 minutes and 20 seconds of screen time. Clayton didn't take home the best directing trophy; it went to William Wyler for Ben-Hur . 5. MIKE NICHOLS // WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966) \nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was nominated for every eligible category during the 39th Academy Awards in 1967.
