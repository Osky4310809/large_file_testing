We have, by far, the highest IQ of any cabinet ever,” Trump said. \nMany of Trump’s Cabinet picks have been criticized for lacking experience in the areas in which they will now be heading. Most recently, Trump’s energy secretary nominee, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, faced widespread criticism after a New York Times article claimed Thursday that Perry didn’t know what the energy secretary even does when he accepted the position.
