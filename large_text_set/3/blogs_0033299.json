And all the car #brands are in on it. Normally most of these are bad. But this one is good, kind of, even if it’s an unintentional send-up of Lexus drivers. \n\nLexus announced today that it has has a new feature for “all models” called Lane Vale. Using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology, Lexus says the tool “will connect to the car ahead and shift the vehicle into the correct lane,” solving the perpetual crisis of left-lane hogs who drive slow as shit. But this is a joke, a very obvious one. \nAdvertisement \n\n“Lane Valet was conceived by top Lexus engineers who understand the importance of safe and steady driving conditions,” said Brian Bolain, Lexus product and consumer marketing’s general manger, in a statement about a feature that is not real whatsoever, and is a real human? Who can say.\n“An appropriate vehicle speed without excessive braking offers optimal fuel efficiency, better traffic flow and decreased driver frustration. We’re just trying to give everyone the best possible driving experience.”\n\n\nHow Cars Could 'Talk' To Each Other In The Future—And Why That Has To Happen How Cars Could &apos;Talk&apos; To Each Other In The Future—And Why That Has To Happen How Cars Could &apos;Talk&apos; To Each Other In The… The phrase V2V, meaning vehicle-to-vehicle communication, gets tossed around a lot when autonomous… Read more Read more \nA Lexus spokesperson confirmed the company went ahead and issued the press release a day early, because April Fool’s falls on a Saturday this year, and us auto writers need some Things to put into our Blogs and Tweets. \nAdvertisement \n\nThing is, it’s not a bad idea at all! Who the fuck wouldn’t want to magically control a slow car in front of you and “initiate a careful but prompt lane change” for them. \nThe slow driver’s right turn signal will illuminate as the system confirms the adjacent lane is clear of other vehicles or obstructions. Lane Valet will then carefully deposit the unhurried driver into the right lane before disengaging, thus allowing others in the lane to continue moving at their previous pace. \nFuck those people. Stay out of the left lane.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:05:07.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
