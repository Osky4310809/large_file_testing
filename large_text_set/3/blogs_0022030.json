In this case, Gibbs was accused of posting this picture to make herself look skinnier, standing next to Katie. Yes, that's right. The trolls even went to the extent of saying that Georgia had photoshopped the image to make herself look thinner. \"We posted this picture online, just as best friends going out on the weekend, it got reposted a lot and the controversy started... You have photoshopped yourself thinner or your friend bigger, what kind of friend are you? Was one of the comments. It broke my heart because Kate and I are best friends. Why would I do that? The fact that a simple picture of two people together went so viral purely because of their body types shocked me.\" But the two women turned this around, and started a joint account by the name of Any Body where they now post pictures of the two of them together, showcasing that any body, every body is beautiful!

All I see here is two women... not one \"skinny\" woman and one \"curvy\" woman. Stop comparing everyone to each other, and accept every person as beautiful in their own right.\" A post shared by Any Body ðŸ’¥ (@any.body_co) on Mar 21, 2017 at 7:09pm PDT A post shared by Any Body ðŸ’¥ (@any.body_co) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:05pm PDT A post shared by Any Body ðŸ’¥ (@any.body_co) on Mar 10, 2017 at 2:14pm PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T09:30:20.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
