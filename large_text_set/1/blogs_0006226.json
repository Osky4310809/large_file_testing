Squandering $1 trillion over the course of a decade? Absolutely. All in the name of repealing health care for America. The Washington Post writes : \nIn a dramatic reversal, many members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus said Thursday they are prepared later this month to support a budget measure that would explode the deficit and increase the public debt to more than $29.1 trillion by 2026, figures contained in the budget resolution itself. [...] \nThe growing conservative consensus comes nearly one year after the approximately 40-member group announced it would rather torpedo the entire budget process than vote for a fiscal blueprint that increased spending without balancing the budget. [...] \nThe Freedom Caucus has not taken an official position on the budget — 80 percent of them need to agree to do so — but many members said the dramatic spending increases created in the 2017 budget measure were only technicalities. They contend that voters understand some sacrifices need to be made to gut the health-care law. \n\"Technicalities.\" Exploding the deficit by $1 trillion over a decade in order to rob people of health care—a technicality and a sacrifice worth making. That is just stunning. \nThe budget Republicans have put forward projects “a $9 trillion increase in the debt by 2026” and there’s only one Republican overtly making a stink about it: Sen. Rand Paul. Will be interesting to see if the “Freedom Caucus” decides to officially endorse the budget—including all its debt and deficit hikes. That decision is reportedly coming on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:13:23.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
