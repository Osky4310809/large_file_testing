Now White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus reveals that this was done quite intentionally . \nChuck Todd pressed Priebus for answers during an interview on NBC News’“Meet the Press.” \n“Mr. Priebus, do you understand why many Jews were offended by the White House’s decision not to note that the Holocaust was about eradicating the Jews?” he asked. \n“Well, I recognize in fact obviously that that was what the Holocaust was about, and it’s a horrible event, and obviously a miserable time in history that we remember here at the White House and certainly will never forget the Jewish people that suffered in World War II and obviously still incredible wounds that remain and a time in history that was of great incredible horrific magnitude and everyone’s heart here is impacted by the memory of that terrible time,” Priebus said. “And so, for the record, that’s the case and certainly we don’t mean any ill will to anybody.” \n“Do you regret, does the President regret not—do you regret the statement?” Todd asked. \n“I don’t know about regret. No, there’s no—” Priebus began. \n“There’s no regret, not acknowledging the pain that—” Todd interjected. \n“We acknowledge it,” Priebus said. \n“But you didn’t,” Todd pressed. \nPriebus is learning from his boss that if you just babble long enough, people will think you actually made a coherent argument. And another spokesperson said this: \nAdministration spokeswoman Hope Hicks said that the statement did not specifically mention Jews because “despite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered,” as quoted in a CNN report published Saturday. \nOh, I see. Not bothering to mention the primary victims of the Holocaust on Holocaust Remembrance Day makes you “inclusive.” They could, of course, have simply said something like, “The Holocaust killed six million Jews along with millions more gypsies, homosexuals, and other demonized minorities.” That would actually be inclusive. You know what I think this was all about? Steve Bannon and his white supremacist pals who hate Jews as much as Hitler did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T15:32:35.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
