And in rural counties, the proportion of drivers wearing seat belts has dropped as low as 70 percent, with 15 mostly rural counties registering below the state average. The proportion of drivers wearing seat belts was 70.7 in Pueblo County, 76.8 in Morgan County and 77.8 percent in Delta County. Pickup drivers and passengers are among the worst offenders, with 24 percent, on average, not wearing seat belts, CDOT officials said — a lower rate of use compared with drivers of other vehicles. \nA similar “click it or ticket” blitz run by the State Patrol in 2016 led to issuance of 1,605 tickets to drivers and passengers in rural areas who didn’t buckle up. Fines for not buckling up start at $65. Parents and babysitters caught driving children who aren’t safe are fined at least $82.
