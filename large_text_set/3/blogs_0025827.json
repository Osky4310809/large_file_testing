Most bore the likeness of Messi and his name while the rest were wrapped in black packaging with a logo saying \"King\" with a likeness of the King of Spain. \nA spokesperson for the Peruvian National Police's Anti-drugs Office (Dirandro) said that no one has been arrested or detained yet. \n\"Most of the 1,288 packages of drugs were camouflaged as squid filets and had a label that said 'Messi' along with a picture of the Argentina player Lionel Messi wearing the shirt of the Spanish club Barcelona,\" the news release said. Se incauto una tonelada y media de cocaína en el puerto del Callao. https://t.co/Iou5PZPHQi pic.twitter.com/vGxQauEyx9 - Policía Peruana (@PoliciaPeru) March 21, 2017 \nThe logos are used to guarantee the purity of the drugs by the gangs who traffic them, the official said, as well as guaranteeing that drugs, which are packaged in bricks, remain sealed. \nThe shipment was found over the weekend after arriving in Lima over land from Valle de los Ríos Apurímac, Ene y Mantaro (Vraem) and headed west with a final destination as the port of Callao. \nThis is the second major police intervention this year, the news release said. \nIn January, Peruvian police found more than 4,508 pounds of cocaine worth $174 million in street value hidden in packages of asparagus destined for Amsterdam. The group arrested was part of an international drug-trafficking network that shipped cocaine to European countries, Reuters reported in January. \nPeru is believed to rival Colombia as the world's largest producer of coca leaves, from which cocaine is made. \nDirandro officials said they believe cartels from Mexico operate in their country and use their distribution networks to send the drugs to Europe and the United States. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:48:52.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
