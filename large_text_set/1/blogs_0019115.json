They did all this shit and said I resisted, but I called out to the motherfucking road to hide out. I didn’t resist shit. They just did that shit they’re trying to hide it from the news people, but I’m here right now.” \nWhile being escorted from the room, Lloyd shouted, “whatever man. Fuck you,” at the judge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T21:04:47.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
