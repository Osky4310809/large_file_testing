Charlton lost the match 4-1 . \nBoylett was also found guilty of violent disorder. He has been in the dock during the two-week trial alongside Colin Kitto, 49, of Eltham, Andy McConville, 48, of Rochester, Kent, Billy Cowcher, 32, of Greenwich, south east London, and Sam Donegan, 25, of Welling, Bexley, in south London, who had been charged with football violence. \nKitto was found guilty of violent disorder. Donegan was cleared of violent disorder but found guilty of an alternative charge of affray. \nKayla’s handler Chris Belsey had been walking her around the Selhurst Park pitch on his forearm when a punch was thrown from the crowd. Prosecutor Daniel Higgins previously told the court: “As he passed the stand he noticed three or four fans were shouting abuse and one of these three or four lent over the barrier and threw a punch directed at Kayla. Mr Belsey is unsure if the punch directed at the eagle had landed.” \nMr Higgins said Kayla “seemed unhurt”, but added “due to her delicate bone structure if she had been hit with force, her bones could easily break”. \nMr Higgins said there “was disorder at the match before, during and after” the game. Before the kick-off police had also spotted a “distinct group” of about five or six fans who had met at a pub in Thornton Heath, south London, before the match, according to Mr Higgins. \nThe first scuffles broke out as police escorted the Charlton supporters to the ground. Officers stood shoulder to shoulder as the crowd tried to push and break the police cordon to get to the rival fans. One officer suffered a cut lip after being hit by what he thought was a bottle. \nAfter the match, Donegan ran at a police cordon wielding a large yellow cone. He ignored police shouts to stop and was subdued with a baton strike. \nDuring his police interview, he said: “I was just annoyed, obviously. We just got battered. I just picked it up and let my anger out.” \nMcConville was found not guilty of violent disorder. The jury were directed to acquit Cowcher, Boylett, Kitto and McConville on a count of violent disorder due to insufficient evidence earlier this week. Not guilty verdicts were recorded. \nThe defendants were released on bail to be sentenced on 28 April.
