He presented a nose stud to the Goddess. \nIn a brief chat with media persons outside the shrine, Rao said he came to the shrine to offer prayers and make the offerings as well to Lord Venkateswara as a fulfillment of his vow. \nRao had made vows for realisation of separate Telangana in the name of deities of different famous temples during the statehood agitation. \nApart from Rs 5 crore for Lord Venkateswara Swamy, Rs 59 lakh has been sanctioned for other deities. \nThis was KCR's maiden visit to the famed hill shrine after becoming the chief minister \nIn the coming days, he is expected to visit Veerabhadra Swamy temple in Warangal to present \"Golden Moustaches\" to Lord. \nThe opposition had criticised the move when government orders were issued, raising questions on spending crores from state exchequer for fulfilling a personal pledge. \nAccording to a report in the Deccan Chronicle , the revenue-surplus Telangana state is facing a huge revenue deficit in the ongoing financial year, with expenditure surpassing earnings. The auditing done by finance department for the April-October period revealed that the state is facing a deficit of nearly Rs 7,000 crore despite revenue-earning departments witnessing a decent growth rate of 15 per cent. \nIn October 2016, KCR had presented Rs 3.5 crore worth golden crown weighing 11.7 kg to Goddess Bhadrakali in Warangal. \nPhotographs: ANI Photo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:21:52.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
