However, one righteous man among all the people of that time, Noah , found favor in God's eyes. \nWith very specific instructions, God told Noah to build an ark for him and his family in preparation for a catastrophic flood that would destroy every living thing on earth. \nGod also instructed Noah to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, both male and female, and seven pairs of all the clean animals, along with every kind of food to be stored for the animals and his family while on the ark. Noah obeyed everything God commanded him to do. \nAfter they had entered the ark, rain fell on the earth for a period of forty days and nights. The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days, and every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out. \nAs the waters receded, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat . Noah and his family continued to wait for almost eight more months while the surface of the earth dried out. \nFinally after an entire year, God invited Noah to come out of the ark. Immediately, he built an altar and worshiped the Lord with burnt offerings from some of the clean animals. God was pleased with the offerings and promised never again to destroy all the living creatures as he had just done. \nLater God established a covenant with Noah: \"Never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.\" As a sign of this everlasting covenant, God set a rainbow in the clouds. Points of Interest from the Story of Noah God's purpose in the flood was not to destroy people but to destroy wickedness and sin. With more detail in Genesis 7:2-3, God instructed Noah to take seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, and two of every kind of unclean animal. Bible scholars have calculated that approximately 45,000 animals might have fit on the ark. Genesis 7:16 interestingly points out that God shut them in the ark, or \"closed the door,\" so to speak. The ark was exactly six times longer than it was wide. According to the Life Application Bible study notes, this is the same ratio used by modern shipbuilders. In modern times, researchers continue to look for evidence of Noah's Ark . Check out this article by Joe Kovacs from Â© WorldNetDaily.com on the \" Ararat Anomaly .\" Question for Reflection \nNoah was righteous and blameless, but he was not sinless (see Genesis 9:20-21). Noah pleased God and found favor because he loved and obeyed God with his whole heart. As a result, Noah's life was an example to his entire generation. Although everyone around him followed the evil in their hearts, Noah followed God. Does your life set an example, or are you negatively influenced by the people around you?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:15:12.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
