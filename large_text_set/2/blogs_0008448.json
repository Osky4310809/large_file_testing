It also allows her to splash out on luxuries like designer dresses and meals at expensive restaurants. \nThe unorthodox job even has the support of her boyfriend, Jack, 20, who said: ‘We are all in college, like it’s very expensive, everyone is trying to eat.’ \nEmily had only been on a few dates with Jack when she decided to start ‘sugaring’ and initially kept her unusual job a secret. But as her commitments as a sugar baby became more regular, Emily told Jack, 20, about the other men in her life. \n‘It was getting difficult to explain why I was never free to go out on a Friday,’ she joked. ‘He was really shocked when I first told him. We had just gone to the gym and I sat him down on the bench and I told him that I had a date that day. \nHe said: ‘If we continue dating I wouldn’t want this to be a lifelong career path for her. But in college, it just doesn’t bother me that much, everyone needs the money.’ \nSo listen: It’s that very attitude at the end that’s going to ruin this dude’s life with this girl. You can’t change a leopard’s spots and once you get a girl who gets a taste of effortless life with other men, it’s going to be hard to turn off that switch with her. Especially if you’re a dude who was trying to “sugar” her at 20 when you theoretically don’t need to do that or have that money to burn. But I do admire his approach to her doing it right now to pay the bills while he reaps all the benefits. Especially since she has these guidelines: \nHowever Emily only agrees to meals and drinks in public places and says even a kiss is strictly off-limits. \nShe said: ‘I think it’s okay to have a friendly hug or your hair touched. I think that’s okay. I think that is about the extent of it for me.’ \nAnd she has strict consequences for men who overstep the mark. \n‘Guys have tried to coerce me to their homes or they’ve grabbed my butt or something, and those guys I don’t ever talk to again,’ she said. \nNow don’t get me wrong, eventually this will end. Some rich dude will swoop in and offer something different and she’ll realize that she can’t do this forever, he can pay for all her shit AND also get the hamster wheel in her loins moving, and now she can try her luck reconditioning a ho as a housewife. But for now if she’s got these rules, is just squeezing these dudes dry, it’s not the worst thing in the world when you’re some 20-year-old fuck boy. And then you get the added bonus of her coming over after the night out and raw dogging her after these dudes kept her bathed in the finest caviars and Swarovski crystals, a virtual cuckolding of some older guy who’s theoretically a class above. The psychology there just makes sense to me, way more for Jack than it does on the “sugar daddy who doesn’t even get a sloppy bar makeout” sugar daddy side. If you’re strong enough to pull it off and keep the ego aside as she’s jet setting around with a 40-something mini mogul, it’s not a bad place to be. \nBut on the flip side, if you’re going to be a sugar daddy guy who doesn’t fuck, there are worse ways to spend your hard earned money I’m sure: \nOh yeah", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:18:09.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
