Neymar is the greatest actor in football.” \nUtd to face City and Barca in ICC \nWhile frustrated at seeing the 25-year-old go to ground too easily, Lustig admits that opponents are often forced into adopting a strong-arm approach in an effort to level the playing field with one of the world’s best. \nHe added: “Neymar is better than me, so to compete you try to be close and sometimes you need to do tricks and get into his head to guess what he will do.” \nNeymar drew a blank in the aforementioned European contest at Celtic Park, but Barcelona emerged as 2-0 victors and have progressed to the quarter-final stage of the Champions League thanks in no small part to the contribution of their Brazilian forward in a remarkable 6-1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16.
