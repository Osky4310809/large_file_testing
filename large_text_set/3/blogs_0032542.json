publisher McClatchy reported similar allegations about Mr Kalugin earlier in March. \nMr Steele's report said: \"A leading Russian diplomat, Mikhail KULAGIN [sic], had been withdrawn from Washington at short notice because Moscow feared his heavy involvement-in the US presidential election operation ... would be exposed in the media there.\" \nMr Kalugin denied being a spy and complained to the press about “lies and fake news” told about him. \nThe BBC also reported Mr Steele had previously provided the US separate intelligence relating to Russia and Ukraine from 2013 - 2016. \nThe former MI6 agent is held in high regard in the UK, this increasingly appears to be the case among his US colleagues as well. The FBI reportedly reimbursed Mr Steele for some of the expenses incurred by his work Mr Trump and Russia.
