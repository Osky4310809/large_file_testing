Jun Acculador/CC BY-ND \nMANILA, Philippines — British companies are looking for growth opportunities outside the capital as the local organization of UK companies embarks on a trade visit to Mindanao later this month. \nChris Nelson, the executive chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines (BRITCHAM), told Bloomberg Philippines that despite some risks the Philippines, especially Mindanao, remains a good opportunity for growth for UK firms, especially in line with the thrust of the national government to channel more investments outside of Metro Manila. \n“I still think from SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) from the British companies the Philippines is still a good, attractive story for growth, and of course Mindanao fits into that because we're looking for growth outside the main urban area of Metro Manila,” Nelson said. \nNelson said that BRITCHAM’s trade mission to Davao City at the end of March was meant to bring and expose companies to business and investment opportunities on southern Philippine island. \nNelson said that their group has monitored growing interest from member SMEs as seen by the success of their chamber’s activities in recent years. Business ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \n“It's growing in interest. We've had over 1,000 companies in three years. We've just had companies set up business recently. We just had the great British festival 500,000 visitors. We've just had companies doing business in terms of whiskey imports,” he said. \nThe executive chairman of BRITCHAM said that the total trade to the country of UK companies was at $74 billion dollars, and this grew by 38% in 2015. \nHe said that this growth came from different sectors such as pharmaceuticals, electrical machinery and even beauty products. \n“The total trade to the Philippines is 74 billion, but we grew by 38%. And the reason that it grew actually the key areas were electrical machinery, pharmaceuticals. We also had some development in food and beverages and cars,” he told the television station. “From our side of the British chamber actually there are a lot of SMEs and they're looking at ICTs. They're looking at beauty products. They're looking at food and beverage, and they're looking environmental to support the economy in terms of waste.” \nNelson also expressed his belief that the power sector, which was the focus of British companies last year, remained a viable business opportunity. \n“Power and infrastructure will always be a focus and I think it's linking into Mindanao. But we're also broadening out to other segments,” he said. \nNelson said that opening up the Constitutional provision on foreign ownership of businesses in the Philippines would boost foreign direct investments (FDIs) in the country. In the first half of last year, the European Union (EU), of which the UK is still a member, was the top sources of FDIs in the Philippines. It accounted for 27% of FDIs during that period. \nAlthough aware of developments in this area, Nelson said that the country could still improve its business climate be enhancing the ease of doing business in the country. \n“We're very supportive of the 10-point plan of opening up the Constitution obviously in terms of foreign ownership. I think it will boost FDI if that occurs. I've seen tremendous growth. I think we also would like to see ease of doing business improve,” he said. \nNelson said that currently their chamber was composed of 280 companies, and one of their main objectives in their Davao trade mission was to link their member-companies with others in exploring business opportunities. \n“We're gonna try and do match-making when we're in Davao,” he said. \nNelson said that British companies were looking at business opportunities in areas such as agribusiness, infrastructure, ICT and professional services. \nHe added that their mission would include a good section of companies ranging from big-ticket companies such as GSK to SMEs.
