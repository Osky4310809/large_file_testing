It's been 20 years since the best show of all time premiered, and without it, I wouldn't be the person I am today — and I know countless others can say the same. My obsession with BTVS began when I was in fourth grade (I had to sneak episodes while my parents were out), and that obsession hasn't wavered since. \nThe show, created by Joss Whedon, is extremely well-written, with a perfect mix of humor and horror, of seriousness and silliness. It's undeniably and infinitely quotable . With an iconic performance from Sarah Michelle Gellar , Buffy taught me how to be a feminist , she taught me how to be open-minded, and she taught me to be strong. The show stands the test of time, so here's why even after two decades (!), it's still one of the best shows of all time. And in the wise words of the leading woman herself, if you don't agree — bite me.
