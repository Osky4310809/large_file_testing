Ken Livingston is facing a disciplinary hearing following his comments on Hitler(Lauren Hurley/PA) \nArriving at the disciplinary hearing on Thursday, he said: “The SS set up training camps so that German Jews who going to go there could be trained to cope with a very different sort of country when they got there.” \n“When the Zionist movement asked the Nazi Government, would they stop the Rabbis doing their sermons in Yiddish and make them do it in Hebrew - he [Hitler] agreed to that. \n“He also passed a law that said only the Zionist flag and the Swastika were the only flags that could be flown in Germany.
