Seriously you can find us singing this song for the rest of the week after watching this performance.\nWith seven Grammys to her name since 2007 and Keith Urban winning his first Grammy in 2006 for the song “You’ll Think of Me,” what better duo to perform at the Grammys than these two! Although the Grammys kicked off in a big way with Adele opening the show and Chance the Rapper winning in the best new artist category, people were talking about Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood before the show even began.\nThe pair offered a 24-hour “first look” of the video for their song “The Fighter.” The track, which originally appeared on Urban’s album “Ripcord” is such a feel good song, so we love that we got to see the performance live. The performance included a technicolor lit up stage and Underwood and Urban singing back and forth “What if I fall?” as Urban answered, “I won’t let you fall.”\nWhat we love the most about this duo performing together is that Urban already had Underwood in mind to join him when he wrote the song.\n“I thought I really would love to write a duet that isn’t the traditional guy and girl singing together, but the girl maybe asking a question and the guy answering her,” Urban previously told Sounds Like Nashville . “Then we set about thinking about who would be the right voice for this and Carrie — I love, love her voice and always have. And so I sent her the song and fortunately she loved it.” This is definitely the feel good song we need going into the spring!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:59:20.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
