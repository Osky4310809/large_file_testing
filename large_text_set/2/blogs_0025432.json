King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 18 hours ago 13 \nSteven Adler was recently asked by Eddie Trunk on why he thinks Izzy Stradlin wasn't involved in the ongoing GN'R reunion, to which he replied (via Blabbermouth ): \n\"Because he wants to do it like me - the right way or not at all. The reason I did it and needed to do it was because I got kicked out of the band for reasons I still don't know. \n\"To say that I'm a drug addict in that band and getting kicked out for drugs is ridiculous. They were doing drugs way more than me, so it's like calling the kettle black. \n\"But it was different stuff. Axl wanted more control of the thing. Then he wanted control of Izzy, and then he wanted control of Slash and Duff, and so one at a time everybody left until it was the Axl Rose band. \n\"Like I said, Izzy wants to do it the right way, with the five of us, and I needed to do it, because I needed closure. I got kicked out. I had a road crew, I had management, I had accountants, I had stage people, I had a band, and then one day, literally in one afternoon, I had nobody - I was all alone. And I was scared shitless. I didn't know what to do. What do I do? All I knew was what I was doing. And then I was left all alone. So being able to at least play the one or two songs at the five shows I did was severe closure for me.\" \nThe drummer also talked about being banned to play more songs with the band, saying: \"Dude, I was in Argentina. Why would they let me play only one song? I have no idea. And out of respect for Fernando [Lebeis, from GN'R management team], I have nothing negative to say, 'cause I was just so glad to be able to do it. And even though it wasn't what it could be and should be, I got closure, and I feel so much better - like there's a billion-ton weight lifted off of me, where I can move forward again.\"Asked whether he approached the management to talk about why he's not allowed to play more, Steven replied: \n\"Of course! I'd start playing another fucking song, and they'd tell me to get off. They'd say, 'Okay, you're done.' And I'd start playing another song, and they'd just turned the sound of. 'Beat it. You're done.' I was, like, 'Okay. Cool.' I got to do that. It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, and I got to rock with those guys. And I love Slash and Duff and Axl, and I got to meet some great people that are working with them. And Fernando, who is GN'R's main guy, he's got some good ideas for hopefully this summer, for the 30th anniversary [of 'Appetite for Destruction'] in July, something for the fans. I don't know what it is, but he's a good guy, and I think he's gonna do the right thing… And there never will be an explanation [for why I can't play more songs with them]. It is what it is, and that's that.\" \nAsked whether he's open for doing more shows with the band, Steven replied: \"If we did it the right way, yes. I can't watch somebody… I will share the stage with Frank any day. I'll do the 'Appetite' stuff, which is the great stuff anyways and the fun stuff anyways, and I'll do the 'Lies' stuff, I'll do a couple of 'Illusions' [songs], and let Frank, in the middle of the set, play the 'Chinese Democracy' stuff, some of the 'Illusions' stuff. If we split it, I wouldn't mind sharing the stage with him at all. I mean, if that's what it came down to, I'm cool with that. He's a great guy. [But] I can't [just play one or two songs per show anymore]. It's just too hard. It's too hard. I wanna play more, and I want Izzy to be there. It was the five of us that made magic, and I know we can make that magic again, 'cause it's just who we are. Even though we're twenty-five years older, I know if we got in a room together and started playing, it would be fucking magic.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:52:10.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
