On Saturday evening, however, the Seattle Seahawks wide receiver made a name for himself with just one ridiculous catch against the Detroit Lions.\nOn fourth and goal in the second quarter, Russell Wilson lofted a pass in Richardson’s direction in the right corner of the end zone and the 24-year-old wideout did the rest. He needed only one hand to secure what is one of the best catches you will see at any level and, for good measure, Richardson drew a defensive pass interference penalty from the Lions defensive back Tavon Wilson. Lions fans were probably irate, though, as Richardson got all of Wilson’s face mask on the play.\n\n*Referee clears his throat\nPass interference on the one guy whose head is no longer connected to his neck. pic.twitter.com/Sfk47xGTYX \n— Isaac (@WorldofIsaac) January 8, 2017 \n\nIn the early going in this Wild Card match-up, it was the pass-catching group from the Lions that was making headlines with drop after drop to the point that Matthew Stafford was virtually helpless. Seattle’s offense sputtered to some degree as well, but Richardson’s masterful execution here was enough to save a potentially fruitless drive for the Seahawks. \nPaul Richardson entered the night with 51 catches and 599 receiving yards over a three-year NFL career. That is nothing to sneeze at, but if this is the best catch he ever makes, there will be absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T04:18:00.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
