The full-service restaurant doubles as a bar and lounge, and comes complete with a wide array of games to enjoy. Double Take slips into the former BLVD 16 space, offering an upscale casual vibe that toys with a Hollywood backlot look. That means exposed ceilings that look like a lighting grid, general movie-themed touches and big artsy film murals spread around. The main draw might be the games though, as Double Take drops Skeeball, darts, pool and more into their big, open space. Guests can pull into a few different enclaves to enjoy the festivities with friends, belly up to the bar for a solo meal, or enjoy the dining area in the main room. That’s not to say food and drink isn’t also a focus. Chef Bryan Podgorski steps into the kitchen after stints at The French Laundry and as chef de cuisine of Bouchon in Las Vegas, but was most recently the corporate chef for the iPic slate of theater restaurants. Dishes span the gamut from avocado fries and deviled eggs to pan-roasted salmon and ricotta toast. Today’s arrival of Double Take marks the succession of similar spots around town, including Koreatown’s new hideaway The Venue , which offers a chic feel while keeping guests entertained all night. Hours for Double Take, located on the Hotel Palomar property, run 6:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. daily for breakfast, with dinner daily from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:57:53.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
