It turns out that Katherine Heigl and John Mayer have known each other for quite some time — and by chatting with him, Heigl actually got a bit of insight on her relationship with now-husband Josh Kelley , who she married back in 2007.\nHeigl appeared on The Late Late Show With James Corden to discuss how it all went down.\nJohn and I grew up in neighboring towns…I think we met at one of his concerts, and…friends, just friends,” Heigl admitted, making sure we all knew that there’s absolutely no romance on their side of this story. Love aside, he still had quite an impact on her. Watch and see how he helped influence what turned into an extremely strong relationship. Again, did you know that they were just friends? \nHeigl emphasizes this point, since she might have just lead Josh Kelley to believe otherwise.\n“I had run into John who was in town making a record or something…I knew it was friends,” Heigl said. “But Josh didn’t know that. Josh, to this day, doesn’t quite believe me.” Heigl, who was a month in with her relationship with Kelley, made it look like she was interested in Mayer to seal the deal with her now-husband. Tricky, but hey — it worked. And it seems like Mayer had no idea. In his mind, he was just catching up with a totally platonic buddy.\nIs it wrong? Well, no. In Heigl’s mind, pretending to see Mayer “put a fire” under Kelley to make it official. Really, it’s actually pretty smart. That in-between stage of relationships, where you’re not sure where you stand, can get pretty irritating.\nThese days, Kelley and Heigl are extremely secure with three beautiful children . No word on whether or not she still chats with John Mayer on occasion, but we’re guessing he’d at least have a good laugh over Heigl’s side of the story.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:55:37.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
