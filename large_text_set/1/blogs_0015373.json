Now they expect their return. “We’ve had promises, especially on controlling spending, from Republicans, and it’s time for them to really keep their word,” AFP President Tim Phillips said in an interview Friday. “Before, they had a reasonable point when they would say, ‘Well, we don’t control the White House.’ There was a time when they only had the House and not the Senate. They have all three now, and so the ability to genuinely get these actions, take these actions, get this agenda done — now they have that opportunity.” \nThe new AFP agenda is being rolled out after a long campaign where the Koch network focused its energy on state and congressional races — not on the presidential race, in what was widely interpreted as a rejection of Donald Trump. […] \nThere are plenty of signs that any tensions between Trump and the Kochs are in the rear-view mirror. Marc Short, a former top Koch network official, will be serving in an influential post in the White House as director of legislative affairs. And the Washington Post reported last month that many Trump transition advisers on veterans affairs had ties to Concerned Veterans for America — a Koch group that was recently brought under AFP’s umbrella. \nWhat that means is killing Obamacare, privatizing whatever government-provided healthcare programs—like the VA's—they can get their hands on and doing away with all the regulations. Particularly the ones that give us clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. You know, the ones that prevent the Kochs from totally maximizing their profits. The people who matter, after all, can afford to buy their own oxygen and bottled water. Oh, yeah, tax cuts, too: \"real tax reform that lowers rates, eliminates loopholes, simplifies the code for everyone, and protects consumers from new tax increases.\" \nThat's what they expect for the $250 million they spent in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T05:08:09.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
