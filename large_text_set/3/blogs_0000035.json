The film is putting up a poor performance in the week days too. According to early estimates, the film collected approximately 1.30 crores* on its fifth day. \nThe film now stands with a total collection of 20.95 crores* at the domestic box office. Rangoon being an expensive affair, needed to perform big in its first week but with its collections dropping already, looks like the film is headed to become a flop. \nStarring Saif Ali Khan, Kangana Ranaut and Shahid Kapoor in lead roles, the war drama received average reviews from the critics.
