AFP \nLOS ANGELES, United States — Cleveland star LeBron James, who has been urging Cavaliers management to add some talent, said Wednesday he’d have no problem if they fill a roster spot with forward Lance Stephenson, despite their on-court history. \nStephenson once tried to rattle James by blowing in his ear during a playoff game between James’ former team, the Miami Heat, and the Indiana Pacers in 2014. \nBut James said that if Stephenson can help the Cavaliers retain their NBA title, he’d be all for his arrival. ADVERTISEMENT \n“I just want to win, man,” James said after the morning shootaround before the Cavaliers’ home game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. “That’s all that matters to me. I got no personal problems with nobody.” \nCleveland was set to work out several free agent players on Wednesday afternoon, including guards Mario Chalmers, Kirk Hinrich and Jordan Farmar, and Stephenson. \n“I’ve got a history with all those guys except Jordan,” James said. “I’ve got a history with Lance too, obviously. I’ve got a history versus Kirk. I played him in a lot of playoff series. And I’ve got a history with Rio (Chalmers). … At the end of the day, Rio is recovering from his Achilles tear. I hope he’s been doing everything he needs to do just to get back on the floor. He loves to play the game.” \nJames played four seasons in Miami with Chalmers as the Heat’s primary starting point guard. \nStephenson was on the Pacers teams that the Heat faced in the playoffs for three consecutive postseasons from 2012 to 2014. \nStephenson averaged 9.7 points, 4.8 assists and 3.0 rebounds for the New Orleans Pelicans in six games this season before needing groin surgery. He was cut by the Pelicans in November. \nThe Cavaliers have a vacant roster spot and could create another by releasing Center Chris Andersen, who has a season-ending knee injury. \nJames, who had not suffered a losing month in an NBA season since 2006, has called upon owner Dan Gilbert to add a veteran playmaker to the roster, preferably as a reserve to star point guard Kyrie Irving.
