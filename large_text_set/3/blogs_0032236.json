They said they didn’t want to ask their parents for money or items they needed because they knew their parents had little to spare. \nOne nine-year-old girl said she and her brothers took it in turns to beg strangers or friends and family for money when family finances reached breaking point. \nOne 11-year-old boy told researchers: “I’m just thinking why couldn’t they let us live in one place instead of keep moving around… if we stay there for two, three, four months then we have to start packing again, then we have to leave, unpack. Yes, it just keeps going like that.” \nA boy,10, said:”Some of the houses had a problem, like… there were rats… Then when we moved to [the next place] there was just dead rats, they were just dead and no-one took them out.” Children in poverty are all too aware of their situation (Photo: Getty Images) \nOn school costs, a boy,11, said:”You get dinner and a pudding and then you go to, like, the sandwich place and just get a drink, but that will be £2.30, but you only get £1.85 for a free school meal.” \nAnother boy,aged 11, said:”Sometimes I save [my pocket money] up but sometimes I spend it on shopping like food, toilet roll, butter, bread, stuff like that.” \nThe charity is calling for the government to ensure that financial support for housing costs increases in line with local rents for families who are renting privately. \nMatthew Reed, Chief Executive of The Children’s Society, said: “The heart-breaking testimonies of children in this report offer a glimpse into the harsh realities of life for the 4m children growing up in poverty in the UK. \n“Moving from place to place, living in neighbourhoods where they are frightened to go outside, and travelling for hours to get to school are pressures that no child should have to deal with. \n“Yet for some of the children we interviewed, these have become normal parts of their lives. This lack of stability and security is hugely damaging to children’s wellbeing and could have long term repercussions for their mental health.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:58:35.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
