The question is: why do they have so many?\n“It is, quite frankly, the ministers who should be held responsible for these expenditures,” he said.\n“If there’s a necessity for a monitor or a television in a particular location, there may be a defence for that, but I am not sure there is a defence to spend over $10,000 per unit.”\nMost Canadians would be surprised tax dollars are going toward $14,000 TVs for government departments, added Aaron Wudrick of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, noting the figure is substantially more than what the average person would spend.\n“I’m not saying the government should not have any TVs,” he said. “The question is: why do they have so many? What are they using them for and are they getting the best value?”\nSpokespeople for ministers of the departments note there is a process in place to ensure standards for approving all expenses, adding the units are used for business purposes.\n“All of the televisions that were purchased since Nov. 4, 2015, were for videoconferencing purposes,” Indigenous Affairs said.\n“The use of videoconference allows the department to reduce travel costs.”\nJordan Owens, a press secretary for Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, noted the Canadian Forces is replacing broken and obsolete equipment.\n“Modern audio visual equipment is an integral tool our military uses for situational awareness, public outreach, and morale and welfare support,” she said in a statement.\n“The department of National Defence has strict checks and balances in place to ensure that all purchases adhere to prudent stewardship of public funds.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T07:12:47.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
