The US is the single largest donor to family planning in the world, but the latest version of the rule would cordon off even more money than that: Trump’s version is broader than his predecessors’, affecting all US global health aid, not just family planning funding.\nTrump’s proposed federal budget, meanwhile, would cut US diplomacy and foreign aid funds by 28%, and experts fear these cuts could roll back major public health gains of the last years.\nIt’s not the first time Cohen’s work has found itself in the center of political debate. This study was initially supposed to be funded by money from the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), initiated by President George W. Bush, but he said the funding for the study was revoked in the waining days of that administration — the last one, before Trump, to invoke the global gag rule and to sustain political sensitivities around family planning services.\nIf Trump’s global gag rule rolls out as expected, it could pose major problems for the model that the study proved was successful. In the public health world, its success is a big deal: There’s lots of different ideas about how to “integrate” family planning services, and groups like the World Health Organization have long thought that “linking” services — referring a woman from the exam room to a family planning clinic just down the road, or across the hall — is as effective as combining them into a “one-stop shop.”\n“There wasn’t any real empiric evidence that one model was better than the other. No one had ever done a definitive scientific study [like the one] that we have done,” Cohen said. “It’s important to test various models head to head and not just presume that all are equal or one might be better than the other.”\nIn this case, combining services into one appointment had significantly better results than the referral or “linking” system. In that system, said co-author Dr. Dan Grossman, “women get lost along the way.”\nFamily planning clinics often have different hours than primary care providers, so women have to make a second trip — which means shelling out yet more money for transportation, a significant burden for low-income women, or organizing child care, or taking time off work.\n“The barriers mount up, with the end result being women aren’t able to get the contraceptive method that they want,” Grossman said.\nIf clinics that use the integrated model don’t sign on to the global gag rule, it could mean the dissolution of the system. US funding supports many aspects of health care in developing countries, and USAID is one of the largest purchasers and donors of contraceptive supplies around the world.\n“They would end up having to go back to the referral model, which we were comparing [integration] to in Kenya, and that just doesn’t work as well,” Grossman said.", "external_links": ["http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172992"], "published": "2017-03-23T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:34:30.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
