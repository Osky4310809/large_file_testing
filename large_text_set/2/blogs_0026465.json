Timothy McLay Using These Files The files of this electronic edition are in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format. The current version of the Adobe Reader is available at no charge. You are free to download these files for your personal, scholarly purposes. They may not be sold or redistributed. For details, refer to the copyright information. These files are protected: you cannot copy from them or print them. However, they are easy to search within Adobe Reader. At this time, Oxford University Press does not have a separate electronic edition of NETS. However, NETS is currently available as a module in Accordance, and we expect that other electronic Bible databases will also license it from the Press in the future. We have provided a list of corrections and emendations incorporated into the second printing of 2009 and a list of corrections and emendations made in June 2014. These lists are also in PDF format. Users of these files are encouraged to report any errata to the editors. Searches If you download any or all of the files to a folder in your computer, you can use Adobe Acrobat Reader to search all PDF files in that folder for a word or phrase. To do this, choose \"Search\" from the Edit menu, type in the word or phrase you're looking for, and for browse for the directory in which you wish to search. Acrobat Reader will go through each document in order and list all of the results of the search. Copyright All translations and introductions are protected by copyright. A detailed copyright notice is included with each file. Critical Editions of the Old Greek Texts The Executive Committee of the International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies offers recommendations regarding the best available critical editions of Septuagint or Old Greek texts for use in scholarly discussion and development, including electronically based research. About NETS NETS is a new translation of the Greek Jewish Scriptures, entitled A New English Translation of the Septuagint and the Other Greek Translations Traditionally Included Under that Title .
