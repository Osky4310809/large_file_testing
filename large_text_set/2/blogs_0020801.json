The gains made from using a new engine from the end of last year to the start of 2017 was estimated at 0.3 seconds per lap, according to Cyril Abiteboul of the Renault F1 team in a report by James Allen on F1 . \nThe R.S.17’s chassis is developed at the team’s base in Enstone, United Kingdom, while the engine was developed in Viry-Châtillon, France. The F1 car itself now measures 2,000 mm in overall width, while front and rear tracks are 1,600 mm and 1,550 mm respectively. The upsized tyres across the board are said to contribute to more exciting racing, too. \n“The cars are an awful lot quicker, they are more visually appealing and that’s going to make the sport more exciting. We will see performance increase by 5 per cent this year, which means that we will see lap times drop by around three to four seconds per lap,” said technical director Bob Bell. “They have a lot more mechanical grip in the corners, we are hopeful that it will make the racing better,” he added. \nWith the new powerplant, Renault will be aiming for better results on track than it had managed last year, while behind the scenes, restructuring and new recruits are aimed at improved results as well. Team principal Fred Vasseur parted company with the team citing differences of opinion, while former Red Bull Racing staff Pete Machin is now Renault F1’s head of aerodynamics. \nThe Renault driver line-up now comprises former Force India driver Nico Hulkenberg, who joins Jolyon Palmer. The Enstone-based team managed ninth placing in last year’s season; Renault aims for fifth in 2017 with the changes it has implemented.
