Their upcoming eyeshadow palette is inspired by all things Dirty Dancing , and we’ve finally gotten a look at one of the amazing shade names. We love anything having to do with Dirty Dancing , and it’s not surprising that the palette would have incredible names with so many cheeky phrases to choose from the iconic movie.\nWe are getting a release date later this week, and it can’t come soon enough! The little glimpses we have seen so far have definitely been enticing.\nThe first shade we’ve gotten a look at is called I Carried A Watermelon, could that be more perfect?\nSNEAK PEAK #2 - Here is one of the eyeshadows from our Dirty Dancing Beauty Palette. And, of course, we had to name this beautiful shade, \"I Carried A Watermelon\". We will be announcing the release date later this week!

Any guesses? You know one of these has to be called Baby.\nDIRTY DANCING BEAUTY PALETTE IDEAS! 2017. #nobodyputsbabyinacorner \nA post shared by Sola Look (@solalook) on Nov 1, 2016 at 7:36pm PDT \nWe love that range of shades, from classic ’80s-inspired bold tones to softer ’60s-inspired shades, which is when the movie takes place.\nSola Look has got the market cornered when it comes to themed palettes that are adorable and lighthearted without being overly kitschy. Please tell us you’ve seen their Flashdance palette, it’s such a treat!\nWhat a feeling! We always love seeing your product shots of our #flashdancepalette. All of the Flashdance pics we used on the palette are original photos provided to us by Paramount Pictures.

Totally evocative of the ’80s without feeling super cheesy.\nAre you on board with Sola Look’s movie-themed eyeshadow palettes? At the very least you have to admit that the shades themselves are really lovely and worth a look. And how funny is that shade name? We love a brand that doesn’t take itself or its products too seriously and knows how to appeal to the film’s fan base. This is definitely the way to our hearts!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:30:12.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
