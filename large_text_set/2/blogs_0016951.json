Chelsea had been regularly linked since January, even after the transfer window slammed shut. “I can be no clearer in saying there is absolutely no discussion between me and Celtic about Moussa leaving in the summer or even next January. We can’t stop people from thinking or talking, but if people can’t see the benefit of Moussa Dembele being at Celtic, there is nothing I can do about that.” It may of course prove to be nothing more than lip service in the end, but Dembélé’s agent appears to be genuinely concerned about more than just money as far as his star client’s future is concerned, and in a way, that’s quite heartening to see even if it does mean that Chelsea miss out on signing the 20-year-old who’s got the world at his feet. “I am not even thinking of the future. I don’t wake up in the morning thinking where Moussa will go in the summer. The future does not exist. The past has gone. It’s about being a better player right now.” “The plan with Brendan and the club and Moussa is private, but I can say it will remain the same and it stays the same. We are there for the boy to become a better player, for the club to achieve more things and the club wants to keep their best players. If Celtic ever wants to sell Moussa, it will be a common decision which is taken between everyone.” Or maybe that’s all just a bit too idealistic once the bidding does start, especially if Real Madrid are sniffing around, too. Money talks, as they say, and £40m is no laughing matter. “Moussa doesn’t stress. He signed a four-year deal at Celtic and, in his head, he’ll be at Celtic for those four years. If he has to leave, that will happen at the right time, but it’s not in Moussa’s head or my head.” “In January, there was speculation, but there will always be speculation if he does well. It’s good. It means we are all doing well. The boy is doing well, Celtic is doing well and we as agents are doing the right things for everyone. But it’s so important to focus on the right things. Moussa remains cool.” -Mamadi Fofana; source: Daily Record So, time to shelve this rumor for a week or two or maybe even a month. See you then!
