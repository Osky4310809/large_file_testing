He then wanted to know if compelling anyone to attend is “political correctness.” \n“It’s interesting because on this part they’re saying it is political correctness that they don’t want to attend,” Lemon noted. “But isn’t it political correctness to make someone attend if they don’t want to attend an inauguration?” \nHe continued, “It seems to me, Matt, that it’s backwards here. If these stars don’t want to attend, they’re not being politically correct. It would be politically correct to do it and say I’m doing it because it’s for the country.” \nLemon was obviously making a reference to one of Trump’s major campaign themes, where he decried political correctness . \nWatch the clip above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
