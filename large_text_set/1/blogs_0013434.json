Lukaku fires home for Everton's opener (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Mirallas drives home for Everton's second (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nAnd their inept second half display, where they looked shattered and totally lacking in ideas, was put into context late on, as youngster Tom Davies capped a fine display with a third, before debutant Ademola Lookman fired home in stoppage time. \nSo who impressed on Merseyside? And who floundered? Here are John Cross' player ratings: Lookman wrapped it up in stoppage time (Photo: REUTERS) Everton \nMade a terrific and crucial block from Silva. Lucky not to concede a penalty. Seamus Coleman 7 \nHas remained consistent this season and full of energy again. Solid. Mason Holgate 7 \nBooked. Looks a real prospect. Some outstanding blocks and interceptions. Holgate slides in on Sterling (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) Ashley Williams 7 \nSome scary moments in the first half, but generally marshalled the defence well. Ramiro Funes Mori 6 \nEnjoys stepping out of defence but also gets dragged horribly out of position. Ramiro Funes Mori challenges Raheem Sterling (Photo: Reuters) Leighton Baines 7 \nEnjoying brilliant renaissance as he defended and got forward well. Gareth Barry 7 \nProvided a steady head and composure in midfield. Still going strong. Tom Davies 8 \nHair straight out of a 90s boyband, he was terrific. And scored first senior goal. A delicious finish from Davies (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Ross Barkley 7 \nCrowd turned the first (and only) time he gave the ball away. Two assists. Kevin Mirallas 8 \nGreat assist for the opener and then brilliant finish for the second. Excellent. Romelu Lukaku 8 MOTM \nFantastic finish for Everton opener. His power bullied City’s defence. Another goal for the Belgian (Photo: Getty Images) \nSubs used: Schneiderlin 7 (Mirallas, 64), McCarthy 6 (Barry, 73), Lookman 7 (Barkley 89) \nSubs not used: Jagielka, Lennon, McCarthy, Valencia, Stekelenburg. Man City Claudio Bravo 5 \nLooks vulnerable in every game. Neither a sweeper or a keeper. Shaky. Claudio Bravo fails to saves Kevin Mirallas's shot giving Everton a 2-0 lead (Photo: Getty Images) Bacary Sagna 6 \nSaw a header cleared off the line and was the better of City’s full backs. Nicolas Otamendi 5 \nOften dragged out of position by Everton’s movement. Uncomfortable game. John Stones 7 \nBooed on his return. Did OK but it is hard playing in this City defence. Gael Clichy 5 \nGave the ball away horribly in the build-up to Everton’s opener. Pablo Zabaleta 5 \nCity spend so much money and end up with Zabaleta in midfield. Hooked early. Zabaleta struggled in midfield (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) Yaya Toure 6 \nStill possesses great quality but you can’t play him and Zabaleta together. David Silva 6 \nBooked. Some quality moments in the first half but needed to be far more ruthless. Kevin De Bruyne 7 \nGood performance particularly first half. Full of ideas despite the result De Bruyne was City's most likely man in attack (Photo: Getty Images) Raheem Sterling 6 \nLong range shot hit the post, unlucky not to get a penalty and was generally lively. Sergio Aguero 6 \nWent close on numerous occasions. Needed to be far more ruthless and clinical. \nSubs used: Iheanacho 6 (Zabaleta, 62) \nSubs not used: Kolarov, Caballero, Navas, Delph, Sané, I, García.
