Spiller Signs with Kansas City Chiefs Al Pereira/Getty Images The Kansas City Chiefs announced an addition to their backfield Friday, signing veteran C.J. Spiller . Spiller appeared in just six games last season with the Seattle Seahawks and New York Jets , totaling 18 rushing yards, 50 receiving yards and one touchdown. Kansas City currently has running backs Spencer Ware, Jamaal Charles , Charcandrick West and Darrin Reaves under contract for the 2017 season. Ware was the Chiefs' primary starter in 2016 since Charles missed all but three games last season due to a knee injury . Charles has appeared in just eight games over the past two seasons, and according to insider Nick Athan , Spiller's signing could lead to the four-time Pro Bowler's release. The 29-year-old Spiller was originally a highly touted first-round pick by the Buffalo Bills out of Clemson in 2010. He showed flashes of brilliance early in his career, especially during the 2012 season, when he set career highs with 1,244 rushing yards on 6.0 yards per carry to go along with 43 receptions for 459 yards and eight offensive touchdowns en route to his only Pro Bowl. Injuries and a dip in usage marred the end of Spiller's tenure in Buffalo, which led to his signing with the New Orleans Saints ahead of the 2015 season. Spiller lasted just one year with the Saints, however, and saw little action between the Seahawks and Jets in 2016. The Florida native figures to slot behind Ware and West if the Chiefs release Charles. While that won't give him a ton of responsibility, he could be a high-value signing due to his pass-catching ability and elusiveness in the open field.
