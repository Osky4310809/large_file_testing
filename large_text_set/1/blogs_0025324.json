Now, she makes sure to make time for it every day. \n“I always thought I was not hungry and now I realize how much energy this actually gives me,” she said, making time for a breakfast of oatmeal, fruit and a smoothie at her desk. \nSt-Onge points to studies that show eating earlier in the day – when your body can better metabolize food – may lower heart disease risk factors such as obesity , high blood pressure and high cholesterol. \nSpreading out your day’s calories across smaller, more frequent meals also seems to benefit the heart. \n“Consume a balanced diet, obviously, but if this can be done in the context of more frequent meals during the waking hours – not so close to bedtime, and earlier in the day – that would be the ideal,” St-Onge said. \nShe also recommends planning your meals, and avoiding eating due with stress, boredom, or fatigue. \nFor Alonzo, sticking to a breakfast routine is also important. \n“If we don’t ritualize something it’s really easy for it to fall away,” she said.
