He is set to take over as the chairman of Tata Sons, which owns TCS. \nIndia’s largest IT company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will consider a proposal to buy back its shares at a board meeting to be held today. In a filing to exchanges last week, TCS said, “Pursuant to Regulation 29(1) of Sebi (Listing Obligations and Disclosure requirements) Regulations, 2015, we would like to inform you that the board of directors will consider a proposal for buyback of equity shares of the company at its meeting held on February 20, 2017.” The board meeting today will be the last for N Chandrashekharan as the CEO of the company. He is set to take over as the chairman of Tata Sons, which owns TCS. \nThis will be the first time TCS will be buying back its shares if the proposal is approved. The company has cash and equivalents of R38,831 crore as of December 31, 2016. The promoters have 73.33% shares in the company as on December 2016.In CY2016, firms spent more than R26,853 crore on buybacks, the highest since 2011. \nTCS had consistently been building up cash to meet the business requirements and for any possible acquisition. Earlier, Chandra had said that he would not want the company to fall short of cash in case any opportunity for an acquisition came along. Over the years, TCS has been increasing its dividend payments to shareholders, Chandra said to CNBC TV18. \nAccording to Sebi rules, a company can buy back shares either from its existing shareholders on a proportionate basis through a tender offer, the open market or odd lot holders. In the case of a tender offer, the company has to deposit 25% of the consideration in the escrow account if the consideration does not exceed R100 crore. \nYou may also like to watch: \nCompanies offer buybacks to enhance their value since the shares bought back are extinguished and the earnings per share (EPS) gets a boost.
