The Independent's Ed Malyon relayed as much: Ed Malyon @eaamalyon Lucas Perez's agent says he hasn't spoken to CalcioMercato about his client wanting to leave Arsenal. Quotes have been picked up elsewhere. 2/20/2017, 1:17:17 PM Calciomercato (h/t Football Italia ) had reported that Rodrigo Fernandez Llovelle said Perez wants out this summer and hopes to join a club of similar stature to the Gunners, although no offers have been received yet: \nIf Lucas leaves London — and he will leave because he's had no chance with [Arsene] Wenger — he wants to go and play for a big club like Arsenal . \nMilan is a great club and he likes them very much, even if we've never talked with the Rossoneri hierarchy. \nLook, the truth is that Lucas wants to leave at all costs and is not happy at Arsenal, he hasn't settled and hasn't had a chance to play and show what he can do. \nNo matter who is the manager in the future, we want to go. The player must have the chance to play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:03:06.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
