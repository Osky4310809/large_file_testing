One fan said the culling was the “end of an era”, while another added, “Tis a dark dark day”. Is there any hope? \nAn O2 spokeswoman said: “We constantly review all the deals available on Priority which gives our customers access to some great offers that help them to save money. \n“Customers can still enjoy access to other £1 lunch offers on Mondays by checking out the latest deals through the Priority app (subject to availability).” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:43:13.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
