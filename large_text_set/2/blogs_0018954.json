Daily Kos is closing in on $1 million raised for Ossoff in the April special election for this suburban Atlanta seat, and now Ossoff has picked up an endorsement from End Citizens United : \n“We need an anti-corruption reformer like Jon Ossoff in Congress to lead the fight against President Trump and his allies, who are doubling down on a rigged system,” said Tiffany Muller, Executive Director of End Citizens United. “Since taking office, Trump has surrounded himself with mega-donors and corporate special interests, and his policies cater to their needs. Jon Ossoff will put the needs of Georgia families ahead of big money and push for reforms to our campaign finance system so it works for everyone. Our members are passionate about these issues and eager to get to work electing him to Congress.” \nWhile Price won easily in Georgia’s 6th District, Donald Trump barely eked out a win in the district. That means an opening for Democrats if they can unite behind Ossoff and help him run a strong campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:10:47.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
