Nasiru Abdul Magaji of no. 50, Sabo Street, Ile-Ife, Osun State reported at the Moore Police Station that one Oba Ademola Ademiluyi the Lawarikan of Apoje land, one Eluwole Akeem and Kuburat wife of Eluwole Akeem all of Ile-Ife, brought some hoodlums with cutlasses and other dangerous weapons to attack the Hausas resident at Sabo area of Ile Ife over a fight between one Abubakar Mohammed of Sabo and Kuburat the wife of Eluwole Akeem. ”The affray which arose from an altercation between the said Kuburat and Mohammed, was amicably settled on Monday, 6th March 2017. He added: “Based on the report at the Moore Police Station, a case of conduct likely to cause breach of the peace was made against the duo of Kuburat and Mohammed and on getting to the scene; the Police team met two groups comprising the Hausa and the Yoruba throwing stones at each other. ”The riotous groups were dispersed and calm was restored. The responding Police teams maintained presence at Sabo area of Ile Ife up till the next day. ”Unexpectedly, on Wednesday 8th March, the peace of the area was shattered with the eruption of crisis that led to the gruesome killings of 46 people. ”A total of 96 other persons were taken to Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital (OAUTH) out of which 81 of them were treated and discharged, while 15 of the victims are still on admission receiving treatment. ”The Special Intervention Force deployed to quell the crisis did not engage in indiscriminate arrests as being reported in some media but worked on actionable intelligence and other information gathered during and after the crisis. And that is why 18 suspects found not to be involved in the crisis were released unconditionally.” One the suspects, Oba Ademiluyi, who denied been involved in the clash said he was on his way home when he noticed that some people blocked the road in Sabo area of Ife. ”I was in Sabo area around 7pm, I noticed that vehicles were turning back. Three guys approached me and said I should try to quell the tension but I told them that I could not speak Hausa. I went home that day using the Lagere route. I arrived home around 9pm. The following day, I went to Lagos and I decided to report the case at Barbeach police station and I was given a serial number. But unknown to me that I would be arrested later. I have no involvement whatsoever in the clash”, he insisted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:55:21.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
