Time to work, we will improve.\" \nMessi's 16th-minute spot-kick separated the two South American giants at the Estadio Antonio Vespucio Liberti. \nThe referee awarded a penalty after Jose Fuenzalida had brought down Angel Di Maria in the area. \nChile had a goal correctly ruled out for offside before Nicolas Otamendi missed a golden opportunity for Argentina. \nAlexis Sanchez rattled the crossbar with a free-kick as Chile left empty-handed. \n\"I'm very happy because we won a game that came out as we imagined it,\" Bauza said. \nAguero flops for awful Argentina \n\"For me, the team played a great game that contained a great team like Chile. \n\"We failed to recover the ball. We could not have it in the last 15 minutes. We won against a great rival. \n\"For me, we did not play a bad game.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:38:21.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
