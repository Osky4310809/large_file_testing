Wiley, who was the much loved character Poussey until [SPOILER ALERT] the end of the last season, and Morelli, who is a writer on the show, have been dating for a few years and got married over the weekend in the same area they got engaged. Martha Stewart Weddings released pictures of the affair, which will be turned into a full spread in an upcoming issue, and it should come as no shock that both ladies (each of them a wearing custom Christian Siriano creation) looked absolutely radiant. \nThe relationship had an unconventional and unexpected beginning, with Morelli realizing she was gay while married and working on the set the hit Netflix series and eventually falling in love with Wiley, but their wedding was nothing short of magical.
