The Eagles would have had every right to feel optimistic off the back of a grand final appearance in 2015. \nYet they simply didn’t reach that height — in fact, they were far from it. \nThe Eagles had somewhat of a reputation as flat track bullies last season — and their losses arguably reflected that. \nWest Coast lost to fellow finalists Hawthorn, Sydney, Geelong, the Western Bulldogs and Adelaide — along with Collingwood — then were knocked out at home by the eventual premiers in the elimination final. \nPASS MARK \nFinals is an absolutely minimum requirement for Adam Simpson’s team in 2017. \nTo put it simply, West Coast’s squad is too good not to justify a spot in the top eight. \nThat said, it’s going to be very difficult to lock down a finals spot, given the amount of teams — think St Kilda and Melbourne in particular — looking to break in. The absence of Nic Naitanui for most, if not all of the season, doesn’t help. But they’ve got to plan for that. \nBut with their best available players aged 25 and above, now is the window for success. \nAnything less than finals footy and it’s back to the drawing board. \nJAKE’S TAKE \n“In Mitchell, out Naitanui — that change should balance out. Overall, the Eagles are well-placed and they’re capable of pushing into the top four even if their team has less midfield strength than a few other sides. In market terms, I’d buy.” \nCHAMPION DATA SAYS … \n“While the overall list ranks third in quality, the Eagles have a big question mark hanging over their head. Their best and most influential player, Nic Naitanui, is injured for the entire season. Take him out of the equation and the quality falls to fifth. It’s not a write off, but it makes it a lot harder with the superstar out.” BUY THE BOOK. \nTHE TRADE PERIOD \nThe Eagles brought in experience and filled some crucial gaps with their recruiting at the end of 2016. \nThe biggest headline was securing Hawthorn legend Sam Mitchell, with the onballer set to slot straight into the midfield mix. \nMeanwhile, well aware of the injury issues plaguing Naitanui and Scott Lycett, the Eagles went out and secured talented — if injury-prone — tall Nathan Vardy. To add further depth, they secured ex-Roo Drew Petrie as another ruck/forward option in the rookie draft. Sam Mitchell of the Eagles.

Remarkably, the Eagles have six players rated elite by Champion Data, with just about every area of the ground covered. \nThat said, you can’t really go past Josh Kennedy. Josh Kennedy celebrates a goal. Picture: Sarah Reed Source: News Corp Australia \nThe Eagles’ spearhead has been the picture of consistency in recent years, booting 60, 61, 80 and 82 goals over his past four seasons. \nAt his best, he’s brilliant and is incredibly hard to stop, especially when he has support around him. \nBut when he’s down, his team can struggle to kick a winning score. \nTHE NEXT BIG THING \nHe’s only played 13 games so far but Tom Barrass has already shown the potential to become a key pillar in West Coast’s defence for years to come. \nThe 21-year-old key defender was exceptionally impressive in the latter part of 2016 and should kick on again this year. \nAs it stands, he’s already rated ‘above average’ by Champion Data as a key defender, while he averaged an elite 2.9 intercept marks and nine spoils per game. \nWith All-Australian Jeremy McGovern for company in the back six, Barrass should continue to learn, grow and improve moving forward. \nBEST 22 \nB: Tom Barrass, Will Schofield, Shannon Hurn \nHB: Sharrod Wellingham, Jeremy McGovern, Brad Sheppard \nC: Andrew Gaff, Sam Mitchell, Chris Masten \nHF: Elliot Yeo, Jack Darling, Mark LeCras \nF: Jamie Cripps, Josh Kennedy, Josh Hill \nFOLL: Scott Lycett, Matt Priddis, Luke Shuey \nI/C: Mark Hutchings, Dom Sheed, Drew Petrie, Lewis Jetta \nEMG: Liam Duggan, Jack Redden, Eric Mackenzie \nOTHERS: Matthew Allen, Sam Butler, Tom Cole, Jonathan Giles, Malcolm Karpany, Tom Lamb, Kurt Mutimer, Nic Naitanui, Jackson Nelson, Luke Partington, Willie Rioli, Josh Rotham, Nathan Vardy, Daniel Venables, Jake Waterman \nROOKIES: Tarir Bayok, Paddy Brophy, Tom Gorter, Fraser McInnes, Jordan Snadden, Simon Tunbridge, Francis Watson Nic Naitanui is out injured. Source: Supplied \nIT’S A BIG YEAR FOR … \nElliot Yeo. After an excellent first season at West Coast, the midfielder/forward dropped off in 2016. \nYeo averaged 16.7 disposals per game last season, down on the previous year. \nHe also dropped off in terms of his contested possession numbers, along with his marks and contested marks. \nBut crucially, he didn’t really improve, when at 22 (last season), improvement should have been a guarantee. \nAt 23 and with 84 AFL games under his belt, Yeo should be well-equipped to bounce back with a strong season. \nOtherwise, the question marks will really come. \nSUPERCOACH MUST HAVE \nAGAIN, you can’t go past Josh Kennedy, who looms as another big point-scorer at $532,200. Players can rack up as many disposals and marks as they want, but goals are ultimately the most valuable source of SuperCoach points in the game. Kennedy has kicked more than most over recent years — and there’s no reason why he can’t top the Coleman Medal table again in 2017. \nWHY SHOULD IT BE YOUR SECOND CLUB? \nThe likes of Luke Shuey, Kennedy and Jeremy McGovern make the Eagles a fun team to watch when they’re on song. \nThe Eagles love to force turnovers, spread the ball and attack in waves. \nPlus, they have the potential to finish just about anywhere in the top eight, if it all comes together. \nIt would make for a fun, if frustrating ride.
