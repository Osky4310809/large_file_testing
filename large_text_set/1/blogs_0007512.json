More than 30 groups have applied for permits. \nThe park service typically reserves space on and around the National Mall for use by the Presidential Inaugural Committee. But the attorneys representing protesters said the agency went too far this time in blocking access to public space. They had threatened to sue by Friday if permits weren’t granted. \nAttorney Mara Verheyden-Hilliard calls the park service announcement “a significant victory for free speech.” \nFollow @CBSDC on Twitter \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
