Photo: Wolter Peeters \nThe temperature at the park is 41.6 degrees in the shade. But Mr Fox's equipment reveals that some of the soft play surfaces in the children's playground are around 84 degrees. By contrast, the bitumen of the car park is a relatively tolerable 64 degrees. \n\"Bitumen is one of the worst surfaces for absorbing heat,\" said Mr Fox. Working with the University of NSW's Faculty of the Built Environment and the Co-operative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living, his research aims to improve city liveability and sustainability through climate-sensitive design.

It's just as well; while sprays of water have cooled the ground down to around 34 degrees, the surrounding areas are registering 77 degrees. \nThe western suburbs are beyond the reach of the cooling sea breezes, which only offer relief for about nine kilometres inland, and the Blue Mountains help trap the hot air. Mr Fox said the density of housing and lack of vegetation also helped raise temperatures in the west. \nResidents are also feeling the heat because aside from what the weather is throwing at the city, there are urban heat islands to contend with. Mr Fox said urbanisation contributed to the formation of two kinds of heat islands, surface and atmospheric, with shade, vegetation, moisture and building materials creating significant local variations in temperature. \nSurface heat islands are observed as variable day and night time surface temperatures, while atmospheric heat islands - which typically peak after sunset - describe differences in nocturnal air temperatures between urban and non-urban areas. The contrast can be as much as 12 degrees. \nBuilt-up areas tend to have more hard surfaces that retain heat for longer and emit that heat at night, raising air temperature, while tall buildings and narrow streets alter breeze paths and reduce radiation loss to the sky at night, Mr Fox said. Urban activities also release heat into the atmosphere - \"think air conditioning, car engines and exhausts and industry\". \nHe said a combination of technologies and strategies can be used to mitigate the heat and make people feel more comfortable: planting trees, providing shade through design, using cool materials on paving, roads and building facades, maximising prevailing breeze paths and introducing water-based elements like ponds, fountains and mist. \nThe president of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, Cr Stephen Bali, wants a coordinated, strategic approach to heat mitigation. \nHe pointed out that western Sydney endured eight days in January when temperatures were 40 degrees or above, while the region's average temperature of 33.9 degrees was more than four degrees higher than the city average. \n\"As Sydney's population is growing there's more houses, less trees, less green, more roads ... it's adding to the heat.\" He said the Office of Environment and Heritage had warned that further development could result in even more extremely hot days in western Sydney by 2030. \n\"The way we're going - and adding another million people plus an airport, more roads, more pollution, more industry, we can expect 10 more extreme hot days a year over 35 [degrees],\" he said. \"It will become the norm. Without the proper designs [and planning] the problem will only get worse.\" \nCr Bali said western Sydney councils including Parramatta and Blacktown were working on innovative programs to tackle urban heat at the local level, and invited government planning agencies to work with councils \"to see whether there is potential for these programs to be rolled out on a regional scale\". \nIt cost councils extra to keep community facilities like public swimming pools open longer, Cr Bali said, and not everyone had air conditioning or could afford to keep it running. \"You can't expect everyone to sit in a shopping centre,\" he said. \nJanuary was the hottest month on record in Sydney and the east coast is bracing for the longest heatwave of the summer , with temperatures in western Sydney expected to climb as high as 45 degrees over the weekend. \nThe heat is not just uncomfortable, but deadly. Since 1890, heatwaves have killed more Australians than every other natural hazard combined, according to a Climate Council report . \nAuthorities have warned that an expected record surge in electricity demand could lead to power shortages during the heatwave , with NSW Energy Minister Don Harwin calling on residents to reduce electricity use and turn their airconditioning up to 26 degrees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:01:35.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
