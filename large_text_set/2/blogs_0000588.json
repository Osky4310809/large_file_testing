Following hefty contributions from Google, Uber and Lyft , the ACLU has reportedly accumulated over $24 million in online donations over the past few days.\n“This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us.\nFIND OUT WHY According to TechCrunch , nearly a thousand Twitter employees pledged a sum of $530,000, which was later matched by CEO Jack Dorsey and executive chairman Omid Kordestani. Twitter says the total allotment stands at $1.59 million.\nAmong other industry heavyweights, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, Nest founder Tony Fadell as well as Slack CEO Steward Butterfield have also backed the ACLU in their battle against the Trump administration.\nThe support for immigrants from the tech industry so far has been nothing short of outstanding.\nEarlier this week Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky extended a helping hand , promising the homestay service will offer free housing to anyone who’s been left stranded as a result of Trump’s executive order.\nAirbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US. Stayed tuned for more, contact me if urgent need for housing\n— Brian Chesky (@bchesky) January 29, 2017\nApple CEO Tim Cook similarly voiced out his dissatisfaction with the travel ban , pleading to the Trump administration to rescind the order.\nIn addition to his appeal, Cook added the Big A has opened a public fund dedicated to refugees and those affected by the anti-immigration order, promising to match all employee donations on a two-to-one basis.\nDeeply moved today visiting @FordsTheatreNPS and Peterson House where Abraham Lincoln took his last breath.
