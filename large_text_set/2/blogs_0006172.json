Jeff Sessions (R-AL) as attorney general. \nDespite bitter and outspoken resistance from Senate Democrats - particularly in the last 24 hours - Sessions was elected as the nation's 84th attorney general along a near-party line vote. \nSessions became just the fifth Cabinet nominee approved by the Senate, joining Trump's choices for Defense, Homeland Security, Education and State. \nOn \"The First 100 Days\" tonight, Charles Krauthammer said that Sessions' confirmation was never in doubt. \n\"Everybody has known that Sessions was going to be confirmed. What we saw over the last 24 hours or so was kabuki theater,\" Krauthammer said. \"The Democrats are completely powerless.\" \nHe said the Democratic opposition to Sessions was \"all for show,\" as they tried to placate their base, which is still furious about the party's devastating defeat in the election. \nSee more from Krauthammer below, and share your reaction in the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:43:10.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
