The Woman Who Filmed the Video Has Started a Fundraising Site for the Store Employees \nJessie Grady, who filmed the first incident with her cell phone, started a fundraising GoFundMe site for the store employees. As of December 1, it had raised more than $32,000. \nShe wrote: “I’m overwhelmed by this response. This is unbelievable!!” \nThe site says, “On the night before Thanksgiving, I witnessed a white woman engage in a 30 minute racist rant (complete with yelling and cursing and repeated references to the fact that employees were African American) against the employees at a Chicago Michaels store – because she did not like that they offered her the option to purchase a re-usable shopping bag for her larger items. I was directly in front of this customer in line, I stopped at the exit to show my 2 year old a Christmas ornament and witnessed first-hand that the Michaels’ employees did nothing to provoke this verbal attack, and in fact treated all customers with professionalism and courtesy.” \nGrady continued, “I was so shocked by this unprovoked attack that I captured 17 minutes of it on video on my phone. I am starting this gofundme because I’d like to do something to try to make it up to the employee who was the main target of this racist attack. I’d like to show her that many people are horrified by how this woman treated her, and that we stand with her and appreciate her hard work. She inspired me because despite the hateful words that were being hurled in her direction, she stood in that entranceway calm and unmoving to protect her staff and customers. Her calmness calmed me and I saw a true leader, which in today’s world, is something to be rewarded. All proceeds from this gofundme will be given to this employee, who has three children, to try to make her busy holiday season brighter. In the current climate I believe it’s very important that we go out of our way to treat each other with dignity, kindness and politeness, and that we stand up for each other when we see people being mistreated.” \nAs for Boyle, she has deleted her social media pages.
