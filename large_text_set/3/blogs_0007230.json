In doing so, Nike joins a long list of clothing companies with designs specifically aimed at Muslim woman, such as Dolce & Gabana’s Abaya Collection and retailer H & M.\nNike said it created their performance hijab in answer to complaints from Muslim women about the difficulty of wearing traditional head scarves during sports activities.\nIn 2015, a Nike ad featured Muslim Egyptian mountain climber Manal Rostom, whose head covering looked like a loose black hoodie. The Pro Hijab is much sleeker.\nEmirati figure skater and elite Nike athlete Zahra Lari. (Nike)\nEmirate figure skater Zahra Lari has tried a prototype.\n“I was thrilled and a bit emotional to see Nike prototyping a Hijab,” she said. “Once I put it on and took it for a spin on the ice, I was blown away by the fit and the light weight.” \nNike spent 13 months designing the Pro Hijab. It is opaque, with breathable fabric and will come in different neutral colors with the distinctive Nike swoosh just at the temple. \nThe Nike Pro Hijab goes on sale in 2018.\nCBSSF.com writer, producer Jan Mabry is also executive producer and host of The Bronze Report.
