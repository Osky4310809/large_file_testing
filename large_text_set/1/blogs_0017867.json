The minority population of women determined to make the rest of us look like mental patients is marching around in their vagina costumes in the deep blue cities again (where the voices of the rest of America are suppressed and ignored).\nPlease recall that these are the same women who claimed to be offended by the use of the word \"pus*y,\" and yet one of the rallying projects for this march was to knit your own \"pus*y hat.\" And they wonder why no one takes them seriously.\nFrankly, with this few brain cells and their inability to comprehend irony, they deserve smaller paychecks. Perhaps the worst thing about these marches (and it's hard to pick just one terrible, awful, horribly bad thing because there are so many) is the fact that the \"women\" they represent are not diverse at all. They are the women of the left (Democrats) only. No other women need apply (and according to them no other women exist). The media is out in force declaring it to be the biggest march in history with all women everywhere united against Trump and for all the left-wing agenda items! If that were true then it begs the question: who were the women who voted in massive numbers on Election Day against all those things? Who was this march missing?\nWomen like the New Wave Feminists who are pro-life were disinvited . Other pro-life women's groups were told not to come. There were no women's gun rights groups in attendance. I didn't see any Catholic women's signs. So the only women these marches included were women who march in lockstep with left-wing, Democrat ideology.\nNewsflash for the terminally slow: THIS IS WHY YOU LOST. You ignore and excoriate the multitudes of the women on the planet who disagree with you at your peril. There are millions of us out here. Instead of talking to us, you ban us. Instead of reaching out to see if we can find common ground, you treat us like we do not exist, and when we smoke you in an election, you blame it on the Russians!\nWe are mothers, sisters, grandmothers, aunts, and daughters and we have women's reproductive organs (that we don't like to run around exposing). We disagree with you broads in every way politically and so we are silenced and banned. We aren't losing any sleep over it because this is seriously not our scene.\nWhat an embarrassing display of vulgarity and naked partisanship. This was a march against Trump and for abortion. That's it. The following are the worst of the worst photos from the event to show you. If you were laboring under some false assumption that this was some general \"women's rights\" march, you were seriously misled. So unless you're a radical, pro-abortion, man-hating, Trump-hating, Christian-bashing ideologue, you shouldn't have been there.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/22/most-embarrassing-photos-from-the-women-who-love-abortion-and-hate-trump-march/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/01/21/womens_march_erects_a_pro-life_barrier_132860.html"], "published": "2017-01-22T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:13:13.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
