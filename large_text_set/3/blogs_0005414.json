Nobody would deny that Russ is at least in the mix for MVP this season. Nobody except for Mark Cuban that is.\nMark Cuban says MVP is a toss-up between James Harden and LeBron James. Where is Russell Westbrook in that mix? \"He's not.\"\n— Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) March 6, 2017 Cuban’s comment is not an opinion that a lot of people share of Westbrook, but it is not necessarily surprising considering the history between he and Westbrook. During the playoffs last year, Mark Cuban said that the Thunder only had one superstar and that superstar was Kevin Durant.\nMark Cuban says Kevin Durant is the Thunder's only superstar. What about Russell Westbrook? \"He's an All-Star but not a superstar.\"\n— Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) April 25, 2016 And much like how Westbrook handled the criticism from Cuban last year, we would expect Westbrook to respond to Cuban on the court rather than in a postgame interview.\nIn the Thunder and Mavericks last meeting, the Thunder won 109-98 and Westbrook went off for 45 points. He has 30 triple-doubles on the season and ironically, will tie Wilt Chamberlain for the 2nd most triple-doubles in a single season, if he pulls one off tonight against the Mavericks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:13:14.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
