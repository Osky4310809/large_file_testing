As Urbanize LA reports , permits were recently filed with the city for construction of a seven-story mixed use development at 6007 West Sunset. \nThe project would replace a row of low-slung commercial buildings across the street from Emerson College’s flashy new Morphosis-designed campus . Plans call for 63 apartments above a parking structure and one level of commercial space. Additionally, the project would include a swimming pool on the fourth floor.\nThe project is being designed by architecture firm Shubin + Donaldson. Renderings spotted by Urbanize LA (but since removed from the firm’s website ) show an orderly design with boxy units and floor-to-ceiling windows. The structure dips down on the western side, where the top level becomes the fourth-story pool deck, surrounded by a ring of commercial space.\nRenderings also show several common areas, marked by yellow-colored walls and greenery, dispersed on multiple floors throughout the building.\nPermits don’t specify a developer for the project, but property records show the project site was purchased in April of 2016 for $15.5 million.\nTake a Tour Through Emerson's Sexy New Hollywood Campus [Curbed LA] Mapped: Hollywood's Out-of-Control Hotel Boom [Curbed LA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:48:33.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
