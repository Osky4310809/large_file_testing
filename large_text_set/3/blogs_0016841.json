The Minister, in December last year, had written to all the chief ministers to identify the beneficiaries in those districts,” the official said. \nWatch this also: \nThe devices to be distributed among the beneficiaries will be of high quality and conform to the standards laid down by the Bureau of Indian Standards. \nHe said that to avail the facilities under the scheme, a beneficiary should be of at least 60 years and will have to be certified by competent authority as a person living below the poverty line. \nAccording to the official, the department had suggested three names for the scheme out of which the Prime Minister’s Office has given nod to ‘Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojna’. \nThe scheme aims to address the disabilities like low vision, hearing impairment, loss of teeth and locomotor disability. \nThe beneficiaries will get walkers, crutches, wheelchairs, tripods, spectacles, hearing aids and dentures among others. \n“The government wanted to roll out the scheme in January, but had to postpone it in view of the assembly elections in five states,” he said. \nThere are 10.38 crore senior citizens in the country as per the Census of 2011 and 5.2 per cent of them suffer from some sort of old age-related disability. \n“It is projected that the number of senior citizens will increase to around 173 million by 2026,” the official added.
