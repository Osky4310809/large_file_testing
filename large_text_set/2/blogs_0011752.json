To keep track of all the facts and figures, he wrote down notes for everything. \n“I think it hid my Alzheimer’s from me—I wasn’t relying on my brain, I was relying on calendars and reminders,” he says. \nBut by the beginning of 2015, Kursonis developed symptoms no time-management method could mask. At least once a day, he’d “blank out,” waking up unsure how many seconds or minutes had passed. \nThinking he might have a sleep problem, he drank more coffee and began eating dark chocolate for an extra hit of caffeine. That didn’t help, and eventually, his consciousness began slipping every 10 minutes or so. When he’d snap back, it took him a minute or longer to understand the information in front of him. \nRelated: 10 Surprising Things That Are Messing With Your Sleep \nHis job required intense focus and comprehension, so his productivity began to suffer. Kursonis talked to his doctor, who’d previously told him his symptoms were nothing out of the ordinary. \nThis time, his fiancée went with him, and helped push for answers. She emphasized how frequently he forgot things, how often she’d find his morning coffee in the microwave in the evening. \nThis time, the doctor referred Kursonis to a neurologist, who did some basic thinking tests. More extensive cognitive testing pointed toward dementia, and MRI scans found no other cause. \nA PET scan revealed plaques of a protein called amyloid in the brain, one sign of Alzheimer’s disease. And a test of his spinal fluid found high levels of amyloid and tau, another protein linked to the condition. \nBy then, Kursonis wasn’t surprised. Though he had no family history, he’d begun doing research on Alzheimer’s disease when he began the testing process. \n“What really hit me was everything that I came across told me my lifespan had just shortened drastically,” he says. “There’s no cure, and in 20 years of drug trials, nobody’s gotten close.” \nHe tried medications that treat symptoms, but they made him feel worse both mentally and physically. Now, he’s not on any drugs, though he realizes that may change as the disease progresses. He knows exercise helps—and before his diagnosis, he’d regularly run 5K races with his daughter and log more than 10,000 steps per day on his FitBit. \nRelated: 4 Ways Your Brain Suffers When You Stop Working Out \nBut now, Kursonis admits he struggles to find the motivation to walk his three beloved dogs. He might log 1,000 steps on a good day. It’s not that he hurts or feels weak—he just doesn’t want to move anymore. \n“You used to be one person, and now you’re another person, and there’s nothing you can do to change that,” he says. \nHis new purpose in life is his website, withALZmyHEART , which shares his personal story and news articles on the condition. \nEventually, he hopes to include a wide range of resources for others in his position. The challenge, he says, is that sometimes the entire day slips away before he remembers to work on the site. And even when he does, he can’t focus for long. \n“I can usually get two maybe three hours in before my brain just shuts down, the way it would if you’d stayed up for three days straight,” he says. “And so I do what I can when I can.” \n“That’s really all I can do,” he says. 4/5 Photograph courtesy of Mike Belleville “I was told it was depression, then Lyme disease.” \nName: Mike Belleville, 54, Bellingham, Mass. \nAge at diagnosis: 49 \nAt first, Mike Belleville laughed off his minor memory lapses as signs of stress or normal aging. \nEventually, his struggles grew more noticeable. The telecommunications technician found himself asking employees he’d previously trained how to do his own job. Once, he got lost on his regular commute; another time, he made it home, but pulled into the wrong driveway. \nAlways a laid-back guy, he now angered more quickly. The turning point came one morning, when he got the cold shoulder from his wife of more than 30 years and didn’t know why. She filled him in on a terrible argument they’d had the night before. \n“I did not remember any of the conversation, at all,” he says. “I had tears in my eyes because of some of the things she told me I had said to her. That was the biggest red flag.” \nBoth personality shifts and short-term memory loss are common in Alzheimer’s disease. Belleville didn’t know for sure that was the problem—but he was worried enough to immediately made a doctor’s appointment. But getting answers took about a year and a half. \nAt first, he was told he had depression, then Lyme disease. (Here are 8 things this editor never knew about Lyme disease—until she got it herself .) \n“I’ve had three spinal taps done now,” he says. “I’ve had multiple MRIs, scans, and neuropsych exams. All these types of things take time to get answers. It’s a very frustrating process.” \nThe results of all these tests combined pointed his doctors toward a difficult conclusion—early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. \nBut about three years later, doctors revised their diagnosis based on new symptoms, including a tremor in his left arm similar to what Parkinson’s disease patients experience. They now believe Belleville has Lewy body dementia, a related condition that involves a different protein in the brain, alpha-synuclein. \nBelleville can no longer drive, a major blow to his independence. He was forced to retire at age 54. What bothers him most, however, is the effect on his family. \nOn Thanksgiving, he couldn’t cope with having all three children and four grandchildren—ages six months to 6 years—in the same place. Their movements and noises make him too anxious. So, they split the holiday over two days. \n“I had to watch one of my granddaughters asking her mom why her cousins aren’t there, and crying because we can’t all be together,” he says. “There’s a real big sense of guilt, knowing it’s because of me.” \nWhen he was first diagnosed, Belleville withdrew and became depressed. Now, he does the best he can to stay active and engaged. He attends regular support group meetings and serves on a national board of early-stage dementia advisors for the Alzheimer’s Association. \nHe encourages others with the disease to get involved, too. “The diagnosis doesn’t mean it’s the end of your life right now,” he says. “You may not be able to do the things you could do as fast as you used to be able to do them but, you still have more to offer.” 5/5 Photograph courtesy of Greg O’Brien “I was my mother’s caregiver—but in denial when it happened to me.” \nName: Greg O’Brien, 67, Cape Cod, Mass. \nAge at diagnosis: 59 \nGreg O’Brien is an investigative journalist, but he didn’t have to go undercover to learn about Alzheimer’s disease. He’d already watched his mother, father, uncle, and maternal grandfather progress through the condition. \nNow, he’s constantly at work on his biggest story yet: What it’s like to live with progressively worsening dementia. His book On Pluto: Inside the Mind of Alzheimer’s details the process. \nHe was in his mid-50s when the symptoms first started: not recognizing people he knew well, getting lost in familiar places, and feeling rage. And then there’s the haze. \n“I describe it as a fog creeping up on the horizon, where you feel it on the back of your neck and it rises up and envelops your head,” he says. “The brain just feels numb.” \nAt this time, he was still the caregiver for his mother, so he put his own health on the back burner to focus on dealing with hers. When he finally went to the doctor, he flunked the cognitive tests, showed signs of Alzheimer’s disease on brain scans, and also tested positive for a genetic mutation called APOE4. \nInheriting this mutation increases your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease between four and 10 times, Fargo says. And many inherited cases begin at a younger age. \n“It looks like there are copies on both sides of the family, so I worry about my own kids, and my grandkids,” O’Brien says. \nTwo serious head injuries—from a car crash and a bicycle accident—also played a role in the timing for O’Brien. \nRelated: Why 30 Former NFL Players Are Donating Their Brains To Science \n“Doctors said these unmasked a disease in the making,” he says. “They won’t cause dementia—but if you’re predisposed to it, they can bring it on.” \nAs the years pass, his symptoms have worsened. About 60 percent of his short-term memory is gone. He regularly hallucinates, sometimes seeing swarms of insects, other times his mother, who passed away in 2008. \nA lifelong runner, he’s long used exercise as a way of staving off his symptoms, which worsen at night. Working out boosts blood flow to the brain and reduces what’s called sundowning, a confusion that occurs in some dementia patients when darkness falls, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. \nBut thanks to a painful narrowing of his spinal cord and numbness in his feet and shins, he can no longer run. Instead, he cranks the treadmill incline up high and walks quickly, still trying to outpace the demons he feels are chasing him. \nO’Brien also has prostate cancer, but has decided not to undergo treatment. (Find out if you should get the PSA test to screen for prostate cancer .) \n“It’s my exit strategy,” he says. “I don’t want to take my family to that final stage [of Alzheimer’s disease]. They saw it with their grandmother, they saw it with their grandfather.” \nStill, he maintains a wicked sense of humor, saying that’s one of the key ways to bring Alzheimer’s disease out of the dark. \n“The other day, my wife looks in the dishwasher and pulls my business cards out. Well, my brain told me that the cards were soiled and they needed to be washed. How could you not laugh at that?” he says. \n“It’s OK to laugh at yourself, and in doing so, have other people laugh and say, ‘Okay, well, if this guy got through it, I could get through it,’” he says.
