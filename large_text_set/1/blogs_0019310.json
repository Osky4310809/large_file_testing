With comedian Aziz Ansari slated for hosting duties, the yearlong tension between the former reality television star and the storied sketch comedy show continued. \nDuring Ansari’s opening monolog, he even compared President Trump to Chris Brown. \n“I don’t know about that other stuff, I just like the dancing and the music, I don’t condone the extracurriculars,” Ansari said. He goes on to expound on the comparison, “If you think about it, Donald Trump is basically the Chris Brown of politics,” he added, “and ‘Make America Great Again’ is his ‘These Hoes Ain’t Loyal.’” \nOf course, the controversial R&B star had a response ready via Instagram shooting back at Ansari “FUCK NO Somebody tell ALADDIN HOP OFF MY DICK.” A video posted by 1 YOU ❤️ 2 HATE (@chrisbrownofficial) on Jan 22, 2017 at 5:04pm PST \nBrown later posted (and deleted) a video where he told his followers not to trust everything they see. “Even salt look like sugar,” he said while claiming he can’t catch a break. “I swear, I’m moving, getting the fuck outta here.” A video posted by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Jan 22, 2017 at 6:08pm PST \nInterestingly enough, Brown collaborator Big Sean performed tracks off his upcoming I Decided. album on the same SNL episode.
