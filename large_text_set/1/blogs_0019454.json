This is seemingly great news, since you can now indulge in your guilty pleasure in a public place instead of shamefully scooping the bottom of a baking bowl before your girlfriend loads her cookies into the oven. DO (pronounced “dough”) will offer raw cookie dough in cup, cone, brownie, cookie, sundae, and milkshake forms. All of these options sound positively delightful, but there’s still the small matter of whether or not eating raw cookie dough is actually safe . While you could get lucky and enjoy the dough without consequence, there’s always the risk of getting sick with a food-borne illness. \nMultiple ingredients in raw cookie dough could be contaminated by pathogens like Salmonella and E. coli , says Soohyoun Ahn, Ph.D., an assistant food safety professor at the University of Florida. Ingesting these pathogens can trigger symptoms ranging from vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea to more series diseases like hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is characterized by anemia and acute kidney failure, says Ahn. Fortunately, DO founder Kristen Tomlan says she’s developed a pasteurized-egg product and heat-treated flour that keeps her cookie dough in the clear.
