Did you know that Aulani Resort was the first Disney property to recognize Hawaiian language proficiency on cast members’ nametags? If you would like to experience a unique and beautiful language, you need only say, “aloha” to one of our Hawaiian-speaking cast members.\nAt Aulani Resort, we have a saying: Look twice, and think three times. With that thought, we begin a series on the Disney Parks Blog : The Language of Aloha. I will take you on a journey through the Hawaiian language that may inspire you to read twice, and think three times. Let’s begin with a word that I am rather attached to: manako, meaning mango.\n\nIn Hawaiʻi, the mango tree commonly towers over our backyards, providing shade and sweet nectars. At Aulani Resort, you can experience mango scents at Laniwai Spa . Or, after a long day at the beach, you might enjoy a mango-flavored beverage at the ʻOlelo Room , a lounge where you will find cast members who are fluent in Hawaiian! There you can learn more about the Hawaiian language and all the beauty it holds. E kipa mai! (Come visit!) And when you do, try some manako, it’s delicious!\nA hui hou, until we meet again.\nNote: In printed materials, Aulani uses the contemporary spelling of Hawaiian words, which includes marks such as the kahako (macron). Because these marks do not often display correctly in electronic formats, including the text of the Disney Parks Blog, we’ve omitted them to ensure clarity. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:43:41.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
