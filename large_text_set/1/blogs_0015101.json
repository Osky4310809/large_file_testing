Upstairs, in the residence, movers will rush around, simultaneously packing up the outgoing family’s last belongings as they unload those of the Trumps. \nBy lunchtime, Obama will have handed over the reins of the world’s most powerful nation to a man who vowed to tear down his biggest achievements and who defeated Obama’s chosen successor. A military aide with a briefcase holding the U.S. nuclear launch codes will stop trailing Obama and leave the U.S. Capitol in Trump’s entourage. \nAfter a rancorous campaign that blew away precedent, an election result that shocked the political establishment and a transition by Twitter that upended convention, the unorthodox will be overtaken -- at least for a few hours -- by tradition. \nThe inauguration is “one of those great turning points” in the nation’s political consciousness, historian William Seale said. “Everything was going along one way and suddenly there’s a turnaround, and he won. A stop and a change. A re-evaluation.” \nTrump’s swearing-in will be “the moment on the head of a pin,” he said. \nOne of the most intriguing aspects of the day will be the limousine ride that Obama and Trump will share on the ride to the Capitol past thousands of onlookers. It promises to be especially awkward: Trump, the real estate magnate and reality-TV star who never held political office, spent years stoking false doubts about Obama’s legitimacy to hold office. Obama spent months telling voters that Trump was uniquely unqualified to be president, declaring that it would be a personal insult were he elected. ‘Heal the Wounds’ \n“His instruction to me was, ‘The campaign is over, I am now president for all the people,”’ Tom Barrack, the chairman of Trump’s inaugural committee, said at Trump Tower this week. Barrack, the chairman of Colony Capital said that the Republican wants to “heal the wounds” of the election, to reach out to Americans with questions and doubts and “build a bridge and tie them back in.” \nLaw enforcement officials expect between 700,000 and 900,000 people to attend inauguration events, about half the 1.8 million the Washington D.C. local government estimated were at Obama’s first inauguration. About 100 different organizations are planning demonstrations either for or against Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said. Tight Security \nMuch of downtown Washington will be closed to traffic to maintain tight security for the occasion. At recent inaugurations, dump trucks and buses have blocked streets just inside the perimeter to protect against truck bombs. About 28,000 personnel will be dedicated to security, from agencies including DHS, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Capitol Police, U.S. Park Police and local law enforcement, Johnson said. \nIn a nod to the heavily rural constituency that helped propel him to the presidency, country singers Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood will be featured performers along with military bands at a “Make America Great Again!” event on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial the evening before the inauguration, the inaugural committee announced. Trump will address the crowd at the concert. \nThe inauguration itself will reflect Trump’s background in reality television. Jackie Evancho, a teenager featured on “America’s Got Talent” is to sing the national anthem. Swearing-In \nTrump is seeking a “delicate balance between abiding by tradition” and leaving “his own fingerprint on a fresh canvas,” Barrack said, but added, “Mostly he’s abiding by tradition especially in the swearing-in ceremony.” \nThat tradition includes having the chief justice of the U.S., John Roberts Jr., administering the oath of office to Trump; Vice President-elect Mike Pence has chosen Justice Clarence Thomas for his swearing-in. \nTrump will parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, past a flashy new hotel that bears his name, back to the White House, to rest up and get changed for the evening’s inaugural balls. He may use his presidential authority to issue executive actions even before the night-time balls -- as Obama did eight years ago -- though Trump hinted in his news conference last week that he may wait until the following Monday, first business day of his presidency, to begin a week-long sprint of policy making. \nWhen Obama was inaugurated, he and first lady Michelle Obama stepped out of the armored presidential limousine and walked a stretch of the parade route. Trump’s team hasn’t said yet whether he will do the same. \nThe is always the potential for drama. Since the early days of the republic, the transfer of power often has been an awkward hand-off. President Dwight Eisenhower thought President John Kennedy too young and inexperienced for the job, and Kennedy’s wife Jackie hated that the Eisenhowers let them know it. Rosalynn Carter and Nancy Reagan didn’t talk in the motorcade limo they shared on Inauguration Day. \nThis year, more than two dozen Democratic lawmakers have said they will boycott Trump’s inauguration, according to a tally by CNN. Last Flight \nWhile most of focus will be on the Trumps’ arrival, the Obamas will have their own emotional experience, said Kate Andersen Brower, a former Bloomberg News reporter and author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies.\" Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.
