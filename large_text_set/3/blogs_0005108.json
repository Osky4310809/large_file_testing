Harry Kane's double brings him to a Premier League leading 19 goals, as Spurs held off Everton 3-2. Mauricio Pochettino applauds Harry Kane's mentality of never settling and always being hungry for more goals. HEROES \nHarry Kane is, as Tottenham supporters are increasingly keen to remind everyone, the ultimate three-season wonder. Against Everton he was virtually unplayable at times, but that is hardly new; impressive on this occasion was that the 25-yard drive from which he opened the scoring came from his first meaningful involvement after a subdued start to the game. He has become the man to light up an occasion and, after coolly slotting in a second, came close to scoring a fourth hat trick in 10 games. But let's not be greedy; Kane, with 24 goals this season in 28 games across all competitions, may well be the best centre-forward around at the moment. \nIs there a player in the Premier League who attacks headers more thrillingly than Fernando Llorente ? It is hard to think of one, and if Swansea complete their escape act under Paul Clement, they will, at least in part, have the Spaniard's neck muscles to thank. Last weekend's goal in the defeat at Chelsea was impressive enough but it was only a warm-up for what he produced in the dying-seconds win over Burnley. His first contribution, thundering home Leroy Fer's cross, was impressive enough, but the execution of his dramatic late winner -- finding the leap, direction and power to head the ball past Tom Heaton -- was simply magnificent. If the header is a dying art, then Llorente should be teaching it at a Ph.D. level. Artur Boruc made save after save against Man United, none more important than the one on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's penalty. \nThere are games when Artur Boruc , now 37 and prone to more than the occasional bobble, barely looks like a Premier League goalkeeper. At Old Trafford, though, he provided a highlight reel of saves that gave Bournemouth a draw they hardly deserved. Manchester United threw everything at Eddie Howe's side, but Boruc saved superbly from Paul Pogba, Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial among others -- before getting down low to his right and saving Zlatan Ibrahimovic's penalty in the last 20 minutes. It could be a huge point for a Cherries side that had appeared to be in free fall. \nIt would have been hard to script a more perfect start to managerial life for Craig Shakespeare , but he has staked a convincing claim to take the Leicester job until at least the end of the season. The champions put in their second assertive, convincing performance of the week to record a second 3-1 win, this time against Hull. They are looking far more like last season's team and applying themselves in the way that they had appeared to forget in recent months. Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy look in the mood once more. And what once appeared a distinct possibility, relegation now seems a less pressing concern. Leicester have a full nine days to prepare for a toppling of Sevilla -- something that would surely hammer Shakespeare's case home. \nIt is no exaggeration to say Sadio Mane is Liverpool's difference-maker these days. When he is in full flow they are an entirely different proposition, and Saturday saw the Senegalese forward at his coruscating best. An assist and a cracking goal were only part of the story in the first half when Arsenal simply could not handle Mane; player and club just need some consistency now, because the frustration is that this was light years ahead of the fare they had served up at Leicester five days previously. If Liverpool stay in the Champions League spots from here on, it seems a reasonable bet that Mane, possibly the division's most improved player over the last year, will have learned that lesson. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's flying elbow on Tyrone Mings could land him in hot water after further review. VILLAINS \nIt had just gotten to the stage where Zlatan Ibrahimovic , lovable old Ibra, appeared capable of doing no wrong in the eyes of his British public. He had won the League Cup final virtually on his own; and he has carried much of Manchester United's season similarly, but when things finally went wrong against Bournemouth the list of offences was somewhat severe. Whether or not he was provoked into it, the blow he landed upon Tyrone Mings was inexcusable, and he must have known that nobody would seriously buy into his excuse that the visitors' defender \"jumped into my elbow.\" It felt as if a degree of justice had been meted out, especially to the unfortunately red-carded Andrew Surman, when he fluffed that penalty later. In the longer term, he may receive a punishment even more damaging to him and United. \nThat said, Tyrone Mings can't get away scot-free either. He may well not have meant the stamp on Ibrahimovic's face that catalysed the ruckus at Old Trafford. One is minded to believe him in saying that, especially as the alternative would be utterly damning, but if his intentions were innocent, then he was at best clumsy. Mings had been keen to get under Ibrahimovic's skin from the opening minutes, clearly determined not to be cowed by his opponent, and the pair had exchanged words on a few occasions before their set-to. It did not necessarily help Bournemouth's case -- Mings was positionally caught napping on several occasions during a first half when United should have pulled well clear. Arsene Wenger may have shot himself in the foot by benching Alexis Sanchez against Liverpool. \nOh, Arsene Wenger . Landing blows on the Arsenal manager is becoming an increasingly popular -- and easy -- sport, and it is hard not to feel sympathy for somebody who has dedicated mind, body and soul to his club for so long. But he does not always help himself, and the decision to drop Alexis Sanchez for the 3-1 defeat at Anfield --- almost certainly a warning to his star forward that nobody is immune to censure with reports suggesting he walked out of a training session last week -- was disastrous. Arsenal offered nothing in the first half before unsurprisingly improving when Sanchez arrived at the break. Even if there was merit in the idea of going with the aerial strength of Danny Welbeck and Olivier Giroud, why couldn't Sanchez start in place of the callow and inconsistent Alex Iwobi? \nA couple of months ago Middlesbrough seemed fairly nondescript but stable enough. They have hardly set the pulses racing all season, but hearts may now start to quicken on Teesside after they entered the relegation zone upon losing limply at Stoke. Aitor Karanka's side is set up conservatively, and that is reflected in their statistics: this was their fourth consecutive league game without a goal, and their tally of 19 is comfortably the lowest in the division. Only Hull and Sunderland, the teams below them, have scored fewer, and Karanka has never satisfactorily resolved Boro's issues in attack. At Stoke he fielded the ineffective Rudy Gestede in place of Alvaro Negredo, while Patrick Bamford did not even make the bench. Middlesbrough, a team with no real personality, are in danger of sinking. \nIf Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman were both in frame for the Barcelona job, the latter's claim looks considerably less convincing after the manner of Everton's defeat at White Hart Lane. A 3-2 reverse flattered them, and the real wonder was that Koeman's team scored twice: he had set them up to battle and scrap in midfield, adding Gareth Barry to the numbers in the centre of the park, but they were comprehensively outplayed for the first 80 minutes and only managed their first shot on target after 70. Koeman wanted to stifle Tottenham, but instead handed them the initiative and gave Kyle Walker and Ben Davies -- who had possibly his best game for Tottenham -- space to dictate matters out wide. The plan quickly unraveled; such a negative approach would certainly not be tolerated at Nou Camp. \nNick Ames is a football journalist who writes for ESPN FC on a range of topics.
