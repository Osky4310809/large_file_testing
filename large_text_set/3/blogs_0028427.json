Coleman is facing a length spell out (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \n\"There was no malice in the tackle and he certainly wouldn’t have intended to hurt anyone. \n\"I know him as well as anyone and I think everyone is disappointed and from Seamus’ point of view it doesn’t look great.\" \nAllen was involved in an unsavoury incident of his own when he clashed with Stoke teammate Glen Whelan. \nThe Wales midfielder reacted angrily to what he perceived to be an elbow from Whelan and the pair had to be separated by other players.

At the time I thought I was caught by an elbow. Who knows? But I couldn’t really care less at this point.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T16:39:08.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
