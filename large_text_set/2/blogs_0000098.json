The chiefs were told the arrests came as part of a procurement scam, although officials acknowledged the men — who staff were told were brothers — had access to virtually all of the computer systems used by the affected lawmakers. Members were also told Thursday night to change the passwords to their email and other applications. \nThe news has rattled nerves on Capitol Hill, especially after the series of high profile political hackings over the last year. “They said it was some sort of procurement scam, but now I’m concerned that they may have stolen data from us, emails, who knows,” the lawmaker said.
