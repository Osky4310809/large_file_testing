Their deals expired in late 2016 and they had been working on per-appearance deals. TNA officials have been trying to sign the couple to new deals. They reportedly agreed to terms at one point but later informed the company that they would not be re-signing. They will not be working this week's Impact Wrestling tapings.\nBennett and Kanellis join The Hardy Boys and Drew Galloway as notable talents now gone from the company. \nFollow Marc Middleton on Twitter at @this_is_marc .
