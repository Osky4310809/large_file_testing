\nThe 2016-17 NBA regular season has hosted some incredible individual performances, but James Harden’s latest triple-double might be the most impressive of them all. \nThe Rockets superstar made NBA history with his triple-double — 53 points, 16 rebounds, and 17 assists — leading his team to a 129-122 win over the New York Knicks. \nHarden became the first player in league history to record 50 points, 15 rebounds, and 15 assists in a sing game, according to Elias Sports, and tied Wilt Chamberlain for the most points scored in a triple-double. \nThe 53 points was a career-high for Harden, while the assists tied a career-high, as the 27-year-old continues to excel under new head coach, Mike D’Antonio. \nPODCAST! The guys are joined by Brooklyn Nets Assistant General Manager Trajan Langdon to talk Duke, his time at CSKA Moscow, and the Nets organisation, before Golden State Warriors guard Ian Clark jumps on to talk about his rise up the team’s rotation, and why the Warriors’ chemistry is so good. \nSubscribe to the podcast on iTunes by CLICKING HERE. \nHarden shot 14-for-26 from the field, 9-for-16 from the three-point line, and 16-for-18 from the free throw line; the Rockets having now won 15 of their last 17 games, improving to 26-9 on the season. \nRyan Anderson finished with 25 points for the Rockets, and was in awe while being interviewed, post-game. \n“Never, in my whole life, have I ever seen that,” an astonished Anderson said. \n“He came up huge tonight. We had our moments where we didn’t play out best basketball, but, obviously when a guys plays that well, he holds us together.” \nBrandon Jennings led the way for the Knicks with 32 points, while Joakim Noah finished with 15 points and 16 rebounds. media_camera James Harden. \nAUSSIES IN ACTION \nJoe Ingles finished with nine points in the Utah Jazz’s 91-86 win over the Phoenix Suns, including 3-for-3 from beyond the arc. \nThe perfect three-point shooting performance brings his season average up to 49.5 percent on the season, which leads the NBA. \nDanté Exum remains sidelined with knee tendinitis. \nThon Maker played just two minutes in the Milwaukee Bucks’ 116-96 win over the Chicago Bulls, hitting one three-pointer in his limited time on the floor. Matthew Dellavedova sat out his second straight game with a hamstring injury. \nThe Associated Press contributed to the remainder of this report. \nMEMPHIS GRIZZLIES 112 — SACRAMENTO KINGS 98 \nMike Conley had 22 points and eight rebounds, and the Memphis Grizzlies used a big third quarter to beat the Sacramento Kings 112-98 on Saturday. \nJaMychal Green made four of Memphis’ 17 3-pointers and finished with 18 points. Zach Randolph and Vince Carter each scored 14, and Tony Allen and Troy Daniels had 11 points apiece. \nThe Grizzlies went 17 for 35 from long range while avenging an earlier home loss to the Kings. \nDeMarcus Cousins had 26 points, eight assists and five steals for Sacramento, which has dropped two in a row after winning a season-high four straight. A frustrated Cousins, who finished with just four rebounds, got called for his eighth technical this season in the third quarter. \nMatt Barnes made five 3-pointers and scored 20 points for the Kings, and Anthony Tolliver and Darren Collison each had 16 points. \nCLEVELAND CAVALIERS 121 — CHARLOTTE HORNETS 109 \nLeBron James scored 17 of his 32 points in the first quarter, and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Charlotte Hornets 121-109 on Saturday night. \nKevin Love added 28 points and 10 rebounds for Cleveland, who played without Kyrie Irving after the point guard injured his right hamstring during Thursday’s 124-118 victory over Boston. Jordan McRae had 20 points and Kay Felder finished with 13. \nJames was 6 for 7 from the field in the first quarter, including a perfect 3 for 3 from beyond the arc. Love scored 15 points in the second, helping Cleveland to a 71-59 lead at the break. \nJames was 12 for 25 from the field in 35 minutes. He also had nine assists and six rebounds. \nKemba Walker scored 37 points for the Hornets, who had won five of six. Frank Kaminsky added 15 points and Nicolas Batum finished with 13 points and eight assists. media_camera Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James. \nMILWAUKEE BUCKS 116 — CHICAGO BULLS 96 \nGiannis Antetokounmpo scored 35 points, Jabari Parker added 27 and the Milwaukee Bucks used a huge fourth quarter to beat the Chicago Bulls 116-96 on Saturday night. \nThe Bucks outscored the Bulls 36-20 in the fourth to break open a tight game and come away with a lopsided win after dropping four of six. \nAntetokounmpo dazzled with an array of layups and dunks. He also had nine rebounds and seven assists in another strong all-around performance. \nParker scored 18 in the second half. Malcolm Brogdon finished with 15 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. Greg Monroe scored 15, and the Bucks pulled away in the fourth quarter after pounding the Bulls on back-to-back nights two weeks ago. \nChicago held out struggling point guard Rajon Rondo, hoping Michael Carter-Williams could provide a spark. But the Bulls lost for the eighth time in 11 games. \nJimmy Butler scored 26 points for Chicago, and Robin Lopez added 12 points and 10 rebounds. Dwyane Wade had eight points on 3-of-13 shooting. \nPHOENIX SUNS 86 — UTAH JAZZ 91 \nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS 88 — OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER 114", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T06:23:52.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
