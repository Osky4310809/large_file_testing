The Fishfinder can also be detached and used as a standalone device.\nAn onboard camera and Wi-Fi system can transmit images, data and realtime 1080p streaming, which can be accessed using an iOS or Android app. Users can also set up notifications on the app, so the robot can do all the work until an interested fish comes by.\nIf you really want to dive into the action the PowerRay can also hook up to PowerVision VR Goggles. Using this feature, the operator can control the robot by simply tilting their head.\nAdding to the unfair fishing advantage, the device has a blue-tinted light intended to lure fish, as well as a \"precision remote bait drop,\" which can deliver bait to a desired location using the mobile app.\nImage: powervision\nConsidering the whole thing relies heavily on a camera, we're unsure how practical this could be unless used in extremely clear water, but the concept is pretty cool and there is always the sonar view from the Fishfinder if the water is murky.\nPreorders for the PowerRay are supposed to start in February, though the price has yet to be announced.\nBONUS: Faraday Future just unveiled a super fast Tesla competitor — here's what it looks like", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/l5UEy6VFX1P_flsDwTwGdkIBQVs=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F336770%2Ff2eff3c3-e982-4956-9913-c98590cd0f87.jpg", "http://giphy.com/embed/3o7TKWtKaPF23NA0ec?html5=true", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/MSMfgnzs.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/MSMfgnzs.m3u8", "http://powervision.me/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/JYt9FAMtGI5tyMcGNXwfAgMpszQ=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F336770%2Ff2eff3c3-e982-4956-9913-c98590cd0f87.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-05T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:29:06.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
