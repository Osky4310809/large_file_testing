UBC helps its employees prepare for the future with retirement planning assistance, phased-in work options for those nearing retirement, and generous contributions to the pension plan. UBC employees can easily access health and wellbeing lifestyle opportunities, with subsidized memberships to the state-of-the-art onsite fitness facility that includes instructor-led classes, swimming, skating, tennis and even rock climbing. \nUBC has over 23,000 faculty, staff and student employees at our campuses in Vancouver and Kelowna, as well as the distributed medical program, hospital, farm, forest and other locations. We are the largest employer of students in the province of British Columbia, with nearly 8,000 student employees working at UBC every year. \nRead more about BC’s Top Employers Awards at http://www.canadastop100.com/bc/ . \nLooking to join UBC?
