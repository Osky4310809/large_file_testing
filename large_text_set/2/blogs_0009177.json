My parents immigrated to this beautiful country as young adults. My Dad is easily the hardest worker I know. My Mom did everything in her power to provide a better life for my sisters and I. My parents knew that in order to do this they would have to leave the country they were born and raised in, Nigeria. This was not an easy decision for my parents. Moving is never easy, especially when you are moving to a place which is completely different from where you have called home all your life. Leaving Nigeria to come to America was scary, courageous and bold all at the same time. When reflecting more deeply on the attributes of my parents, I have quickly come to realize that they had to have some of the same characteristics as a large majority of other immigrants to America, including the colonial settlers. People who have willingly come to America decided to travel here to pursue a better life. This similar characteristic provides a bedrock for what it means to be American; life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Growing up When I was 6 years old sitting in a classroom in PS 24, I did not realize then what I know now. I did not know that the majority of countries around the world do not offer a free public education to all children. I did not know that I was considered an English learner student in the school I was attending. I did not know that it was not normal for my older sisters to work at a young age so we could pay the rent for the apartment we lived in. I did not know a lot of things. I was a typical 1st grader who was more interested in Transformers and playing Kung fu with my friends during recess than having a full understanding of the sacrifices my family has made. My story is not unique. The Lord has blessed me in unbelievable ways. Access to a free education was key in allowing me to pursue my dreams. I have a beautiful, intelligent and amazing Wife and we have 3 spectacular children. I am grateful to be an American and am thankful for what this country has allowed me to do. Furthermore, I am grateful to have parents who dared to dream big and come to a new land to have their children and start a new life. I have a high level of empathy for immigrants. I believe this is because I am a first generation American. I truly believe the majority of immigrants have come to America to pursue a better life. This goal is no different from why the earliest colonists decided to leave western Europe and gain independence. However, I am quickly realizing that a large group of Americans feel the American Dream should only be prioritized to a certain region of the world versus looking at each individual person uniquely. The Bible states in 1 Samuel 16:17 “ … for God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said “I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” I have to admit that this is easier said than done. However, I believe it can be done.I look to children for inspiration here. Lessons from a child As I was boarding a plane to fly to Los Angeles, a child about 4 years of age said to his Mom “why is he so dark”. The Mom appeared to be embarrassed and quickly apologized to me and reprimanded her child for asking this question. As I took my seat, I reflected more deeply on what had happened and realized that there was nothing wrong with her child asking the question. Actually, it is probably a pretty smart question to ask if you have never seen anyone with skin as dark as mine. Her child did not say it as a negative or a positive, but out of pure curiosity. In order for us to view people’s heart and character, we have to be comfortable with asking each other questions out of curiosity and better understanding. This allows us to have empathy for one another. Empathy is the ability to share in and understand the feelings of another. This is a quintessential attribute to have when trying to look toward the heart of individuals. I would like to challenge all of us to be more like a child and ask questions out of understanding so we can learn more about the person’s heart. Keeping the American Dream Alive The American Dream is about this idea that anyone can be anything with hard work and perseverance. This is why my parents came to this magnificent land years ago. This is why millions of people from all around the world have immigrated here. George W. Bush stated these words in one of the most challenging times in recent history, “Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shattered steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. America was targeted for attack because we’re the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining.” My parents’ story is one of millions of examples of immigrants coming to this country because it is a beacon for freedom and hope. It is a place where you can Dream Big and go after your goals. Let us not ever let this light stop shining. I would like to conclude with a verse my Wife has been using as a mantra for our family, Micah 6:8. “…and what does the Lord require of you? To act justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:13:23.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
