The America’s Got Talent alum, who sang at the presidential inauguration last month, is speaking out against President Donald Trump ‘s plan to rescind protections for transgender students . “I am obviously disappointed in the @ POTUS decision to send the # transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. # sisterlove ,” Evancho, 16, tweeted on Wednesday. The classical singer’s older sister Juliet, 18, came out as transgender in 2015 in an exclusive interview with PEOPLE . “ @ realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor to sing at your inauguration. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u to talk transgender rghts,” Evancho added, tweeting the president directly. As the New York Times reports , the Trump administration plans to reverse an Obama era order that allowed trans students to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identified. I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 22, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts ❤ — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 23, 2017 After Evancho’s inauguration performance was announced in December, the star — who previously performed for President Obama — opened up to PEOPLE about the hate she and her family received online. “My family is kind of a big target. I have a transgender sister, and so a lot of hate goes towards us,” he said at the time. “I also get a lot of love. We pay most attention to that. Sometimes we get really annoyed with the hate — everyone does, we have to admit it. But we just ignore it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:42:56.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
