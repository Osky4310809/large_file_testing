Authorities reportedly found the man dangling from the fence, where he had gotten stuck.\nThe man had reportedly tried to scale the fence at 15th Street shortly before 11 PM, but became \"entangled in security features affixed to the top of the fence,\" TMZ reports. The man, the third attempted White House intruder in March, was reportedly taken down by Secret Service.\n\"He was up there dangling on the fence, and the Secret Service grabbed him,\" said Republican representative Jason Chaffetz.\nPreviously in March, a man was able to wander on the White House grounds for almost 20 minutes before finally being detained by Secret Service. Jonathan Tuan-Anh Tran, 26, claimed to be a \"friend\" of the president, adding that he \"had an appointment,\" according to the NY Times.\nTran was charged with entering a restricted area \"while using or carrying a dangerous weapon,\" for the two cans of pepper spray in his backpack. Tran was also reportedly carrying a book by President Donald Trump as well as a letter to Trump, where he talked about \"Russian hackers.\"\nWhen Trump heard about the incident, he reportedly said that the \"Secret Service did a fantastic job last night,\" adding that Tran was a \"troubled person.\"\nThe Washington Examiner reported that the Secret Service had recently removed security sensors from the part of the fence that Tran scaled on March 10, according to Western Journalism. Chaffetz said that during Tran's 17 minutes of \"lingering\" and \"hanging out\" on the White House grounds, he tied his shoes and at one point \"jiggled\" a White House door knob, seen on security footage that was revealed later.\nOne week after Tran's intrusion, another man stopped his car at the White House checkpoint, reportedly claiming to have a bomb in his trunk. \"This is a test,\" the man is reported to have said as the Secret Service detained him.\nThat man, identified as Sean Patrick Keoghan, 29, was charged with making false bomb threats, as well as unauthorized use of a vehicle, after it was discovered that the car he had been driving was reported stolen.\nEarlier the same day, William Bryant Rawlinson, 58, was arrested after jumping over barricades to enter a restricted area, but never entered the White House grounds. Rawlinson was reportedly \"yelling nonsensical statements.\"\nIn response to the recent incidents, Chaffetz, who serves as the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said that the Secret Service's practices needed to be improved.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:53:17.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
