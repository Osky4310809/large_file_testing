Photograph: Bryan Cox/AP   23.23   23.25 GMT \nA young woman applying for the renewal of her Daca status was arrested and detained by immigration agents in Jackson, Mississippi on Wednesday, shortly after she addressed a press conference in support of undocumented migrants’ rights. \nDaniela Vargas, a 22-year-old who came to the US as a seven-year-old child from Cordoba, Argentina, had told the rally how she dreamed of returning to college and becoming a math teacher, according to her attorneys.

Vargas had been a recipient of Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program, which allows undocumented migrants relief from deportation and education and work rights. \nBut her Daca status had recently expired, with her attorneys lodging an unresolved renewal application in recent weeks, Elmore said. \n“She is not a danger to society. She is a good person who can contribute and she’s the sort of person that the Daca legislation envisaged. It was correct for her to be under there, and we hope she can get under that statute again,” said Elmore. “But first we have to get her out of jail.” \nThe Trump administration has empowered immigration agents to effectively target most, if not all, of America’s 11 million undocumented migrants for deportation under sweeping reforms that vastly expand the agency’s powers. Nonetheless, the president has been cautious to comment on the Daca program, which still remain in place. Homeland security officials have suggested that Daca recipients will not be a priority for deportation.

Vargas told local media at the time she had hid in her bedroom closet out of fear, and was eventually handcuffed by officers who broke down her door after a five-hour standoff. On that occasion, however, Vargas was released. \n“During that time, I couldn’t even breathe, honestly,” Vargas told the Clarion Ledger in February. “I just watched them handcuff my dad and take them. I was scared for my life. I didn’t know. I didn’t know anything. I called my mom and I just let out a cry. I didn’t even get to see my brother leave; I think that was the harshest thing for me.” \nElmore said his firm had not heard from Vargas since her arrest earlier on Wednesday, but he believed she had been transferred to Ice detention in Louisiana. He would not comment on whether the arrest was retaliation for Vargas’s conversations with the media. \nIce did not immediately return a request for comment. \nSince Trump has assumed office, a handful of Daca recipients have apprehended by Ice agents and remain in detention.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:43:11.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
