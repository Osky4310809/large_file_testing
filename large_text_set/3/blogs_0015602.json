Devin Nunes asked whether there was any evidence Russi ans directly altered vote tallies in key states Trump won. Rogers answered that there was \"nothing generated by the NSA\" to suggest there was direct hacking of voting machines.\nThe president's Twitter account quickly shared the response in a short clip, tweeting equivocally: \"The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process.\"\nThe NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process. pic.twitter.com/d9HqkxYBt5\n— President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017 But the clip took Nunes and Rogers' response out of context, a point Democrats were quick to point out.\nRep. Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, later read Trump's tweet to Comey and Rogers and asked them to correct the record.\n\"I asked you whether the intelligence community had undertaken any sort of study to determine whether Russia interference had any influence on the electoral process and I think you told me the answer was no,\" Himes said, referring to questions earlier in Monday's hearing.\n\"That's correct,\" Comey said.\n\"I've got a tweet from the president an hour ago,\" Himes said, reading the tweet. \"That's not quite accurate, that tweet?\"\nAfter saying he hadn't \"been following anyone on Twitter\" during the hearing, the FBI director reaffirmed the agency did not study whether Russian interference affected the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\"It's hard for me to react to that, let me just tell you what we've said is. We've offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact, because it's never something we've looked at,\" Comey said.\n\"So it's not too far of a logical leap, that the assertion that you have told the Congress that there was no influence on the electoral process, is not quite right,\" Himes asked.\n\"It certainly was not our intention to say that today, because we do not have any information on that subject,\" Comey replied. \"That's not something that was looked at.\"\nHimes then asked about a separate video Trump tweeted on Monday slamming the so-called unmasking of individuals involved in intelligence investigations.\nNSA Director Rogers tells Congress unmasking individuals endangers national security. pic.twitter.com/jTwjPINvNh\n— President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017 \"My understanding was, as a member of the committee, that there is a lengthy and very specific process for the unmasking, but it does not inherently of itself endanger national security,\" Himes asked after reading the tweet.\n\"I assume the comment is designed to the leaking of such information,\" Rogers said. \"But again, I have not read what you are saying to me, so I'm not in a position to comment on it.\"\nThough they attempted to avoid politicizing the investigation further, Comey and Rogers on Monday appeared to rebut several Trump claims.\nComey confirmed that the FBI had no evidence suggesting President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump, which the president accused his predecessor of doing, without evidence, earlier this month. And Comey said law enforcement officials were investigating potential links between top Trump campaign figures and the Russia government.\nSEE ALSO: As an expert witness for Whole Foods, Kellyanne Conway gave testimony that was deemed 'fundamentally flawed' and thrown out NOW WATCH: Watch Trump's budget director explain proposed cuts for after-school programs that feed children Donald Trump James Comey", "external_links": ["https://t.co/jTwjPINvNh", "https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/843867194954076161", "https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/843865267008655360", "https://t.co/d9HqkxYBt5"], "published": "2017-03-20T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:09:05.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
