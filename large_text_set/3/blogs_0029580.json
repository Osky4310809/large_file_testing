They chose abdominal stem cells because they were the kind most easily obtained through liposuction, says researcher Lars Lund, DMSci., a professor of urology at Odense University Hospital in Denmark. \nEach participant received a single, stem-cell injection into their corpus cavernosum, a spongy, cylinder-like structure that runs the length of your penis. Out of the 14 men who were still urinary continent after their prostate surgery, over half of them regained their sexual function, meaning it effectively reversed their ED. \nSo how does this treatment work to improve your erection? It’s able to address the blood flow issues of ED on a cellular level, says Lund. \nBasically, when your penis can’t spring a full erection, your penis tissue remains in a hypoxic state, which means it’s not getting enough oxygen. This can negatively affect blood flow—not enough blood can flow in to make you get hard.

(Should you get your PSA levels tested to screen for prostate cancer ?) \nBut the findings still may be applicable to men with other types of ED, says Lund. It could be especially useful for those with diabetes or high blood pressure , since those conditions usually involve blood flow dysfunction, Lund says. And that, of course, can affect erectile function and contribute to ED. \nWhat’s more, this type of treatment may be preferable to temporary treatments like Viagra or injections like alprostadil because it has fewer side effects than those avenues. Also, it allows for more spontaneity, since you don’t have to pop a pill or get an injection beforehand to get hard, he adds.

The next step is a randomized trial with placebos to make sure that it was the treatment, not just the belief that something was being done to help the ED, that truly made the difference, Lund says. \nThe researchers are already beginning a larger phase two trial, so stay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:24:40.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
