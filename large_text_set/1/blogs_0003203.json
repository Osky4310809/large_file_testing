Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t,” he said in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” President-elect Donald Trump is expressing more doubt that Russian hackers interfered with the U.S. election. As the Obama administration's sanct... \nSpicer was asked if Mr. Trump agrees with Mr. Obama’s actions or whether he plans to reverse them. In response, Spicer said that the president-elect plans to sit down with the leaders of the Intelligence Committees on Capitol Hill to receive a full briefing next week. \nDuring the interview, Spicer also questioned why Mr. Obama acted now. Spicer said the administration didn’t appear to respond, at least publicly, to the 2015 hack by Chinese hackers into records held by the Office of Personnel Management. \n“China took over a million records, sensitive data of people like me who had worked in the government at any time,” Spicer said. “Not one thing happened.” \nSpicer was asked whether Mr. Trump can accept the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia was behind the cyberattacks during the U.S. election, and he deflected and refused to give an answer. \nLast Thursday, the Obama administration announced a new series of sanctions against Russian intelligence agents and entities that the U.S. says were responsible for hacks into the Democratic National Committee and other servers. Part of the move also called for the expulsion of 35 Russian operatives from the U.S. \nA number of top Republicans in Congress, including Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, applauded the president’s actions. \nMr. Trump, on the other hand, said it was time to “move on.” Over the weekend, he continued to express doubt about the assessment that Russia interfered with the election and claimed that he has insider information no one in the public knows . © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
