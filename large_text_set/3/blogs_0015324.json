During an interview with GQ, he let his feelings be known about the project. Kaluuya will play W’Kabi, the chief of Wakandan security and T’challa’s second-in-command in Marvel’s comics world.\n“This is an African blockbuster, bruv. This is like Game of Thrones ,” Kaluuya said. “This is crazy. And Ryan Coogler is just, man dem. He’s like us! He’s a normal dude, in a Golden State hat and a Tupac T-shirt directing the whole set. It’s the most beautiful thing to see.” I’m assuming he’s referring to the scale and the hype surrounding HBO’s Game of Thrones , rather than those problematic rape storylines.\nAnd to his sentiments, it’s beautiful to see is how many people, especially black Marvel fans, are stoked about Black Panther . The excitement even sparked #BlackPantherSoLit (started by @ ChadwicksChill ) and has been used by everyone from Ava DuVernay (whose name was tossed around as director early on) to @Luvvie .\nFollowing the events of Captain America: Civil War , T’Challa returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his rightful place as King. But when an old enemy shows up, he finds himself tested as both King and Black Panther in a conflict that threatens not only his country, but the entire world.\nThe film stars Chadwick Boseman in the titular role, as well as Lupita Nyong’o, Michael B. Jordan, Forest Whitaker, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Sterling K. Brown, Daniel Kaluuya and possibly Andy Serkis. Black Panther is directed by Creed and Fruitvale Station’s Ryan Coogler and is slated for release on February 16, 2018.\nWill you go see it?\n(via SlashFilm , image via screencap)\nWant more stories like this?
