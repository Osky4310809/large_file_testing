The actual targets could be people under federal investigation, but they could also be any foreign power the government is keeping an eye on.\nThe natural inclination here is to assume this is part of the whole dust-up over ties between the Trump administration and Russia. Funny there's news on that today , too. Nunes wouldn't say a whole lot about what was happening (which makes his run to the media a little weird) but insisted that this incidental surveillance was not connected to Russia at all. He also seems to think the incidental collection itself was \"legal,\" but isn't entirely sure.\nIt seems as though the press conference is intended to bolster the argument coming from some Republicans that the problem here is the leaking or spread of information within the intelligence community. Nunes said that some names had been \"unmasked\" in intelligence reports that had been distributed internally. This means that, much like what might have happened with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, the names of Americans who had been swept up in this surveillance may have gotten into the hands of intelligence community workers who weren't supposed to have them.\nNunes is a mass surveillance supporter , and so he's trying to thread a needle here. He wants to present Trump and Trump's staff as having their privacy violated by leaks while not wanting to suggest there's a problem with the amount of surveillance that takes place.\nBut there is a definite \"Switch places, everybody!\" mentality on surveillance authority now that Trump and Trump's people have been targeted. This tweet by Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) is quick to say that the surveillance must have been connected to an investigation or influence by a foreign power. Lieu, however, is also a big opponent of mass unwarranted surveillance , and you'd think he'd be a bigger skeptic than this. Getting your private data and information \"incidentially\" collected in surveillance is not and should not be treated as evidence of wrongdoing, and that was partly the point of efforts to restrict federal authorities collecting whatever they could.\nIn all likelihood, mass unwarranted surveillance played absolutely no role in this snooping, and the intelligence officials had secret warrants though the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts. But for somebody who sits on Congress' Fourth Amendment Caucus to jump in the direction that suggests an assumption of guilt on the basis of it being a political opponent is a problem.\nClearly, there will be a lot more to come on this issue. Watch a bit of the presser with Nunes below. Trump has said he feels \"somewhat vindicated\" (according to the Associated Press) about his insistence that he had been wiretapped:\n. @devingnunes : \"I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the President-elect and his team were, I guess, at least monitored…\" pic.twitter.com/wCxJu3irPZ \n— CSPAN (@cspan) March 22, 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:14:42.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
