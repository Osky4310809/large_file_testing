He plays Mick Carter in the soap (Photo: BBC) \nA source close to the programme told Mirror Celeb: \"It's absolute nonsense, just looking at the video you can tell he's not having a meltdown or having a go at his co-stars. \n\"The situation is that everyone was trying to leave the arena but couldn't at that moment so everyone was just stood around talking. \n\"Danny didn't even go to the after party and he wasn't drunk. He had a couple of beers but wasn't in a state and didn't have to be calmed down. It's just nonsense.\" \nMirror Celeb has contacted Danny's representatives for comment.
