(Photo: AP/USA TODAY) \nDave Chappelle's criticism of comics Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele is making headlines again, thanks to a new interview with Gayle King . \nBefore Chappelle's two new stand-up specials arrive on Netflix on Tuesday, the comedian stopped by Monday's CBS This Morning, where he Chappelle joked about the conflicted relationship he has with his former Comedy Central hit Chappelle's Show. \n\"I was in this very successful place, but the emotional content of it didn’t feel anything like what I imagined success should feel like. It just didn’t feel right,\" he said. \" Chappelle’s Show ’s like breakin’ up with a girl and you still like her. But in your mind you’re like, ‘That (expletive) is crazy. I’m not goin’ back.\" With critiques on Cosby and race, Chappelle's back at the top in new specials \nThe comedian famously walked away from Chappelle's Show, and its $50 million payday, at the height of the program's success in 2005, escaping to South Africa and spending the next 12 years away from TV. His two new specials from his personal comedy vault, which Netflix acquired last year in a $60 million deal, mark a major return for the once-reclusive star. \n“Did the fame scare you?” King asked. \n“Fame, yeah, but not so much that I get on a plane to Africa,\" he said. \"Fame is not that kind of scary. But it is – fame is a horrifying concept when it’s aimed at you, you know? At the end of the day...you don’t have that much control over it. You just try to conduct yourself as best you can.” \nKing also referenced Chappelle's past criticism of Key & Peele , Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele's Comedy Central sketch comedy. In previous stand-up sets, Chappelle blasted the duo for copying his show, joking about \"watching Key and Peele do my show the last five (expletive) years.\" \n“I think there was a speculation that Dave doesn’t like Key & Peele or Dave thinks, ‘Okay,’” King said. \n“No. I’m a fan of this show,” Chappelle said, before explaining why Key & Peele sometimes rubs him the wrong way. \n“I fought the network very hard so that those conventions could come to fruition,” he said. “So, like the first episode I do, that black white supremacist sketch . And it’s like, ‘Well, that’s 10 minutes long. It should be five minutes long.’ Why should it be five minutes long? Like, these types of conventions. I fought very hard.\" \n\"So when I watch Key & Peele and I see they’re doing a format that I created, and at the end of the show, it says, ‘Created by Key & Peele,’ that hurts my feelings.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2nslUzK Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:07:35.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
