Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJurgen Klopp doesn’t buy trophies – but the Liverpool boss is ready to splash the cash in the summer. \nKlopp, a two-time Bundesliga champion and German Cup winner with Borussia Dortmund, turned down an offer to purchase replicas of the silverware he won in his homeland – because he prefers memories to medals. \nBut after making an £11.5million profit for Liverpool in the transfer market last summer, the Kop boss has declared that his hopes of adding the Premier League to his honours list this season has been undermined by injuries. \nAnd he revealed that he is planning to spend big when the transfer window opens.

Look, it’s only March, but I know what needs to be done and we have a plan. \n“One thing we must not forget is that the players who are already here can improve, but the other thing is the transfers. \n“Are we looking for transfers? Yes. For players? Yes. Are we close to signing them? No, there is nothing to say about that. \n“It’s not that we say we want exactly four players or five players, but we have different plans and we know what we want and we are working really hard.” Klopp got rid of Benteke in the summer (Photo: Getty) Read More Jamie Carragher admits he is still angry over Xabi Alonso's Liverpool exit in 2009 \nLiverpool cashed in on Christian Benteke and Joe Allen last year. And Klopp admitted that the injury problems suffered by Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Danny Ings have highlighted the lack of depth in his squad. \nKlopp also insists there was no pressure on him to sell last summer – although Liverpool’s American owners will be delighted by the German’s promise that he isn’t one for wasting cash. \n“When I won the league in Germany I could have bought a replica of the trophy,” he added.

I am lucky to win a lot of things already, but that doesn’t help my programme here. \n“That’s why I won’t buy a player if he isn’t the right player. Not buying is better than doing that.” poll loading Will Liverpool finish in the top four? 4000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:30:24.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
