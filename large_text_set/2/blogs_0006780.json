The film has received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics ahead of its release date, with IndieWire’s own David Ehrlich giving it a B+ and said that it’s a “thrilling reminder of what can happen in the increasingly rare instance when a visionary filmmaker is given serious cash without constraints.” \nREAD MORE: ‘A Cure For Wellness’ Super Bowl Trailer: Gore Verbinski’s Creepy New Horror Film Poses as a Pharmaceutical Commercial \nBefore the film hits theaters, listen to an exclusive track from the film’s dark, ominous score by composer Benjamin Wallfisch , whom Verbinksi describes as “the progeny of musical genius” and that he has the unique ability “to take abstract ideas and render them sonically.” \n“This track opens with ‘Hannah’s Theme,’ a dangerous lullaby, deceptive in its innocence, that weaves its inevitable web throughout the movie, promising absolution,” says Wallfisch about the track. “About halfway through the track, this evolves into the other main theme of the score, ‘Volmer’s Theme,’ a darkly chromatic melody that never resolves, endlessly searching in vain for its harmonic center, its home. It’s an examination of the ‘dark spot on the X-Ray of our conscience.’ as Gore Verbinski puts it.” \nWallfisch also composed the score for the film “Hidden Figures,” for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe. He also recently scored the thriller “Within” and the horror film “Lights Out.” Wallfisch has been credited as a conductor or orchestrator on a number of major Hollywood films, including “V for Vendetta,”“Atonement,”“Moon” and the Best Picture-winner “12 Years a Slave.” \nREAD MORE: ‘A Cure for Wellness’ Trailer: Mia Goth Contends with a Bathtub Full of Snakes \n“A Cure for Wellness” will be released in theaters nationwide on Friday, February 17, courtesy of 20th Century Fox.
