New haircuts \nThere’s no better way to wipe the slate of your shitty life clean than by getting yourself a sweet new ‘do. But when Venus is in retrograde, you probably won’t be nailing that pixie cut. \nYou could walk into your stylist’s salon with a binder bigger than Mitt Romney’s filled with women who showcase perfectly what you want. \nBy the time you walk out of there, though, you’ll be wondering if she was looking at pics of a dog. I’m talking about a dog, like, BEFORE it gets rescued. \nAnd that is a choice you’ll have to live with. Giphy Botox \nObviously, this is a risky endeavor whether Venus is in retrograde or in the passenger seat of your Chevrolet. \nBut the truth is, if you’re going to fill your face with a toxin to erase the sands of time, you’re going to need to wait until Venus speeds the fuck up again. \nThe universe doesn’t screw around, you guys. Do NOT test her on this one. New clothes \nOnce, when Venus was in retrograde, I went through a T-shirt dress phase, even though they made me look like I was a teen mom. \nI have hilarious pictures that I won’t share here because I use them specifically for ritualized self-love practices when I need to forgive myself for things I’ve done in the past. \nDo you want to have to do this, too? Probably not. \nStick with your reliable wardrobe, at least until April 15. Besides, when Venus is in retrograde, money tends to come in slowly. Giphy Experimenting with new makeup \nI want to tell you this, and I want you to listen carefully: NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO CONTOUR. \nYou will look like a doll from the 1840s that has been sewn up several times. You are not a Kardashian, and you do not have makeup artists to figure this face witchcraft out for you.

Stop testing fate!

So, whatever you’re thinking of doing to alter your perfect appearance, it can wait. I promise! \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
