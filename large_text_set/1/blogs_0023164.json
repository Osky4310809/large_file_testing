It isn't pretty. Nintendo/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nWhen the hype has subsided and the reality sets in, the awakening can be harsh. \nWhat once seemed exciting and glamorous is suddenly just another gadget you use in the toilet. \nThis is something Nintendo understands. Last year, everyone was excited about the idea of its Switch, a gaming console that seems like the perfect hybrid . \nNow Nintendo has decided to come clean on the grimy truth. It wants you to use it on the toilet. \nIn a new ad released in Europe, you see the Switch being picked up in the first shot. \nThe second shot is a pair of jeans. They're around a young man's ankles. Just in case you're wondering where he is, a helpful overhead shot leaves very little to the imagination. More Technically Incorrect Elon Musk says he'll start digging LA tunnel in a month \nThere's a shot in between those last two. It shows the young man is happy. It leaves unclear the true reason for his happiness. \nLet's assume, though, that because this is a Nintendo ad, here is a young man whose life perspectives have been significantly broadened by the existence of this machine. \nYou may be delighted that the ad shows a little multiplayer action. You may also be delighted that this action doesn't occur in the toilet. \nEven at launch, there were those who wondered whether the very name \"Switch\" enjoyed certain, well, dirty connotations. \nNow it's a little clearer that Switch seems to be about switching locations -- anywhere, any place, anytime -- rather than whipping your lover into a frenzy. \nCNET Magazine : Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition. \nLife, disrupted : In Europe, millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle. Tech should be part of the solution. But is it? CNET investigates.
