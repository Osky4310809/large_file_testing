He was 67. \nDownes said that Wetton died “after a long and tenacious battle with cancer.” \n“It is with great sadness and a heavy heart, that I have to report we have lost my dearest friend, brother, bandmate and long term musical collaborator, John Wetton,” Downes said on Facebook. “He will be remembered as one of the world’s finest musical talents, and I for one of many was wholly blessed by his influence. It was a massive privilege for me to have worked with this genius so closely on our numerous projects together over the years.” \nAlso Read: Rick Parfitt, Status Quo Guitarist, Dies at 68 \nA mainstay in the prog-rock scene, Wetton boasted credits including King Crimson, Roxy Music, Uriah Heep and Wishbone Ash. \nWetton’s biggest musical success, however, would come as the frontman of ’80s supergroup Asia, which, in addition to Wetton and Yes keyboardist Geoff Downes, included Yes guitarist Steve Howe and Emerson, Lake & Palmer drummer Carl Palmer. Releasing their self-titled debut album in 1982, the group enjoyed hits with songs including “Heat of the Moment” and “Only Time Will Tell.” \nWetton departed the band in 1983 under murky circumstances, with the band stating that Wetton had quit and Wetton saying that he had been fired.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:17:35.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
