It’s not a surprise that he became world No. 1; to many, it’s a surprise that it took him so long , in his 10 th full season on Tour. \nLook, we cannot predict the future. Johnson’s stay at No. 1 could be two weeks, 20 weeks or 200 weeks. But at age 32, with the major monkey off his back and with his personal life in order, Johnson has the potential to reign for a while. Last year’s Player of the Year campaign felt like the start, not the pinnacle. \n1. The rankings have finally caught up to the eye test – right now, Johnson is the best player in the world. \nJohnson has a slim lead (by about .50 over Day), but to his peers it’s about time the math worked in his favor. He is remarkably consistent. Of the 50 events that count toward Johnson's world ranking, 30 – THIRTY! – have gone for top-10s, and over the past eight months he counts victories against top fields at Oakmont, Firestone, Crooked Stick and now Riviera. \n“Honestly, I’m surprised it took so long for him to get to No. 1 in the world,” said Wesley Bryan, who attended the same high school and grew up playing junior golf with Johnson in South Carolina. “He’s got all the talent that you could ever want in a golfer.” \nSaid Jordan Spieth: “No surprise to us players, and I don’t think too much surprise to many others.” \nSaid Day: “He deserves it because he’s been playing great golf.” \n2. Johnson doesn’t overthink much. He claims he didn’t think about the No. 1 ranking on Sunday, even when he was a few hours from taking over. \nUnlike many of the recent world No. 1s, DJ didn’t publicly express that reaching the top spot was a significant goal. Win tournaments, he reasoned, and I’ll get there eventually. And so he did. \n“I don’t really understand it,” he said of the OWGR math, “but I can read 1-2-3. I guess that’s all that matters.” \n3. There’s been a revolving door at the top in this post-Tiger era. \nJohnson’s rise to No. 1 is the 24 th (!) change at the top of the world rankings since October 2010. That followed a five-year run in which Woods was the only No. 1 in golf. \nThe players who have held the spot the longest since 2010: Rory McIlroy (95 weeks) Luke Donald (56) Jason Day (51) \n4. About the only thing Johnson didn’t accomplish Sunday at Riviera was setting a new tournament scoring record. \nLanny Wadkins’ 20-under 264 has held up since 1985, the longest standing record on the Tour schedule. Johnson moved to 20 under after a birdie on the sixth hole, but he made three meaningless bogeys over his final 10 holes to keep Wadkins’ record safe, for now. \n“Next year,” Johnson said with a smile. \n5. DJ’s ascension ended Day’s 47-week stay at No. 1. \nIt’s been an uneven start to the year for Day. He has struggled with his driving accuracy and iron game, but most concerning is his putter. The Tour’s best putter a year ago, he entered Riviera ranked 193 rd . Then he had another brutal week on the greens in LA, losing nearly 1.9 strokes to the field and ranking 59th out of 71 players. \n6. That Sunday 63 was an important round for Thomas Pieters’ immediate future. \nTrying to earn his PGA Tour card so he can play both tours in the future, Pieters took a big step toward earning special temporary status with a tie for second at the Genesis Open. (He needs just 13 more FedEx Cup points to match the total of No. 150 last year.) The high finish earned him a spot in both WGC events next month, essentially locking up status that would give him unlimited sponsor exemptions for the rest of the season. \n“It’s not going to change [my schedule] for this year probably,” he said. “It will just make my schedule a little bit easier next year. \n“I’d like to combine both of them. Ideally I want to play here until May and then go back to Europe and play the events I want to play.” \nPieters will be in the field this week at the Honda. \n7. Something to keep an eye on: Justin Rose’s thumb. \nTaped up during the final day, Rose said that there’s a “little flare-up” on the top side of his left thumb that only affects his chip and pitch shots, not full swings. He still tied for fourth. \n“It was good motivation to try and hit as many greens as possible,” he said. \n8. Rarely does a regular PGA Tour event have such a scoring disparity between the two waves. \nThe early-late starters (like, say, DJ) were greeted by scoreable conditions in the first round that became more difficult as the afternoon progressed. By Friday morning, those in the late-early wave (like, say, Spieth) encountered 40-mph winds and a cold, driving rain. Johnson was among those who began their second round Saturday, after the worst weather had rolled through, and found a rain-softened Riviera with hardly any wind. \nThe stats bear that out: Early-late wavers in Round 2: 70.47. Late-early wavers in Round 2: 72.86. \nThat’s an Open Championship-like imbalance, but an unfortunate part of the game in an outdoor sport. Players can only hope their misfortune evens out over the course of a year. \n9. No result last week was as surprising as the play of Hideki Matsuyama. \nA combined 146 under par over his last 10 starts, he ballooned to a second-round 80 at Riviera. Sure, Matsuyama has blown up before – in fact, he has four scores of 78 or worse since March – but he’s been on a tear of late, with five wins in his last nine worldwide starts. This was his first missed cut worldwide since The Barclays. \n10. In other Hideki news … his familiar disgusted follow-through moves have only gotten worse. The shot below kissed the flagstick, but he looked as though someone ran over his dog. \nIt’s OK to have high standards – these are the best players in the world, after all. But someone needs to get in his ear, because this is really annoying, both to fans and his fellow playing competitors. The highest of standards. pic.twitter.com/Ln4KpD8VhP — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) February 18, 2017 \n11. Here are the biggest storylines to watch as the PGA Tour begins the Florida/Mexico/Florida/Texas swing and the road to Augusta: The status of Rory McIlroy: In his only appearance this year, the world No. 3 finished second while playing with a stress fracture in his ribs. He hasn’t played since, but he plans to return at next week’s WGC-Mexico Championship . Will he log enough competitive rounds this spring to complete the career Grand Slam? Who will emerge as the favorite?: According to oddsmakers, Spieth is the narrow favorite over Johnson, but five players in all (Rory, Day and Hideki) are better than 12/1. Which one of these studs will pick off another one or two titles in the next six weeks as the Masters draws nearer? Will another star step forward?: The first two months of the next year have been awesome, with Justin Thomas, Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, Sergio, Spieth and now DJ all hoisting trophies around the globe. If players like Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott, Patrick Reed or Rickie Fowler enter the fray, it’ll be one of the most wide-open Masters in recent memory. \n12. The format was a bit confusing, and Sunday was emotionally draining for players, but stroke-play medalist Brett Rumford won the experimental World Super 6 . \nTwenty-four players competed in five six-hole matches on the final day, with the top eight players after 54 holes of stroke play receiving byes. Afterward, Rumford called it a “really, really tough week.” \n“It was a unique challenge in trying to win a golf championship and feeling that same emotions, tension and pressure for six holes in four straight matches,” he said. \n13. Who did Rumford beat in the final match? Thailand’s Phachara Khongwatmai, who is only 17. Viewed another way, he was born two years AFTER Tiger’s first Masters victory. \nThis kid already has two pro wins and is ranked inside the top 150 in the world. \n14. Lizette Salas’ bid to make it 2-for-2 for the Americans went up in flames with a final-round 78 in Australia. \nInstead, it was Ha Na Jang who closed with a 69 to steal the title . Only Ariya Jutanugarn (five) has more wins over the last 13 months than Jang (four), who moved to No. 5 in the world. \nSpeaking of Jutanugarn, she placed third as she looks to tighten the top of the world rankings. World No. 1 Lydia Ko, making her 2017 debut after wholesale changes last fall, didn’t break 71 and tied for 46 th . \nThis week, in As the Tiger Turns … \nWoods scheduled a news conference for Tuesday, rescheduled it for Wednesday and then canceled it altogether. Doctor’s orders. He also wasn't able to present the trophy. \nThis would seem troubling, that the “back spasms” were so intense that he couldn’t even appear at the tournament that now benefits his foundation. But not so, said Tiger’s agent Mark Steinberg: “We’re not talking about an extended break.” \nOf course, that doesn’t add up. Woods has taken off the past three weeks, which means that whenever he’s cleared to resume physical activity – right now, he’s been advised to “stay horizontal” – he’ll again have to ramp up his fitness and practice. And that takes time, lest he put his body in another vulnerable position. \nIt wouldn't surprise if he didn't play again until the Masters. \nThis week's award winners ... \nUnsung Heroes: Riviera and PGA Tour grounds crew, which began work at 2 a.m. Saturday to try and get Riviera playable. Without these guys, the Genesis Open doesn’t end on Sunday, simple as that. \nNope, Nothing to See Here: USGA and R&A. In an unintentionally hilarious study released last week, they found little driving distance growth from 2003 to now. A convenient window for analysis, since there was a 25-yard increase the previous decade … \nNot What He Was Looking For: Phil Mickelson. The 46-year-old just wrapped up a busy West Coast swing, with five consecutive starts after offseason hernia surgery. His best finish was a tie for 14 th , and Mickelson said it was his normally reliable short game – lag putting, chip shots – that cost him strokes. \nEnd of a Hot Run: Spieth’s under-par streak. His 1-over 72 in the third round at Riviera ended a streak of 27 consecutive rounds in red numbers. He tied for 22nd. \nWelcome Back: Fred Couples. Boom Boom won the Chubb Classic for his first Champions title since 2014. It also completed some cool symmetry, as this was the 25-year anniversary of Couples’ victory at Riviera. \nMore Disappointment: Bryson DeChambeau. Looking for just his second top-30 worldwide in the past nine months, the eccentric 23-year-old instead withdrew from Riviera with a hand injury. He even posted a picture of his bandaged palm , claiming the injury was a result of, gulp, working too hard. (Not surprisingly, this did not go over well in the comment section.) DeChambeau’s absence, coupled with his Microsoft Cloud commercial, touting his scientific background, added up to a rough weekend. \nNot Havin’ It: Grayson Murray. You don’t need a physics background to figure out to whom he was referring. Hey @PGATOUR there should be a rule if you get a sponsor invite and withdraw after 28 holes your not allowed any other invites rest of year — Grayson Murray (@GraysonMurray) February 17, 2017 \nBut How Do You REALLY Feel?: Colin Montgomerie. He told Golf.com he wouldn’t trade his career for Tiger’s , because Monty says he over achieved, becoming a Hall of Famer despite never winning a major. Some pros wouldn’t trade their careers for Tiger’s because of the fishbowl existence, and that’s understandable. But here’s guessing Monty (31 Euro Tour wins) would gladly trade his career résumé for Bernhard Langer’s (42 wins, two majors) or Nick Faldo’s (30 wins, six majors), no? \nWhy Are We No Longer Yelling “Fore!”?: Pat Perez (and everyone else in his group). During the third round, Perez brained an unsuspecting fan to the right of the 12 th fairway. Not a single player in the group yelled to signal the errant shot, and the ball made a sickening sound when it bounced off the fan's forehead. Fortunately, the guy was OK, but he needed help to stop the bleeding. Three holes after the scary incident, Perez pegged another spectator, this time in the arm, again without a warning. Yelling \"fore!\" should not be optional. \nRough Week for Media Members, Non-Trump Division: Golf photographers/cameramen. First, photographer Cy Cyr got drilled in the stomach by a worm burner, then a CBS cameraman nearly was taken out by a Sergio Garcia tee shot. Anyone know the number for workers’ comp? Coming in hot!!! — Golf Channel (@GolfChannel) February 16, 2017 \nBlown Fantasy Pick of the Week: Bubba Watson. A winner at Riviera twice in the past three years, Watson was careening toward a missed cut before he no-showed for the resumption of his second round Saturday morning. He’s been all out of sorts this year. Sigh. Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:59:07.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
