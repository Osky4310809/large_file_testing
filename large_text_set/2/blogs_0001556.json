Earlier Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself had advocated for electoral reforms including tightening the noose around anonymous donations made to political parties. Jaitley went on to announce that parties will now not be allowed to accept donations of more than Rs 2000 in cash from an individual donor. While BJP has gone into an overdrive hailing it as a revolutionary move, sadly, it will do little to usher transparency in political funding.\nAs per section 29C of the Representation of the People (RP) Act, 1951, political parties were allowed to accept donation up to Rs 20,000 from anonymous individuals. Now this limit has been reduced to Rs 2,000. Assuming that only one percent of the 125 crore population decides to donate Rs 2,000 anonymously, it would amount to Rs 2,500 crore. There is no limit to the number of people who can make contributions. In effect all the government has done is to reduce the cap on the amount which can easily be countered by increasing the number of anonymous donors.\n#BudgetTimes | Big step for transparency in political funding: @arunjaitley pic.twitter.com/Ok6bNUXMXo\n— Times of India (@timesofindia) February 1, 2017\nSince government’s note-ban decision on November 8 last year, there has been public outcry over why political parties have been given special privileges at the expense of the common man. In his public address just after the budget, Modi lauded the move to limit cash donation to Rs 2,000 describing it as ‘aasha aur akaanksha’ of the people. But how does that bring in any transparency or curb the rampant use of black money in political funding?\nI also welcome the historical step to bring transparency and cleanliness in political funding by restricting the cash donation to Rs 2000.\n— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) February 1, 2017\nAs per data compiled by the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR), only 25% of the annual income of BJP and Congress comes from known sources. Nearly 75% of their income comes from anonymous donors. If the government was really serious about bringing in transparency, it could have done away with cash donations altogether. One the one hand our Prime Minister mentions a video going viral online in which a beggar is seen using a swipe machine, yet his finance minister leaves a loophole for cash transactions for political parties to breathe easy.\nThe intent is good but much more clearly needs to be done to make political funding reform meaningful.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/BudgetTimes?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/AmitShah/status/826715693349343232", "https://twitter.com/arunjaitley", "https://t.co/Ok6bNUXMXo", "https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/826697910272266240"], "published": "2017-02-01T12:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:03:35.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
