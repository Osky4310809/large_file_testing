(Supplied: Bathurst Real Estate) \nAn inquest into a murder-suicide in central-west New South Wales has found a prominent businessman had tried to convince his former partner to remain in a relationship with him on the night of the incident. \nThe bodies of Elie Issa and Nadia Cameron were found in a home at Kelso, just east of Bathurst, in July 2015. \nMr Issa, 60, was a well-known businessman and owned a popular cafe in the city for more than a decade. \nMs Cameron, 52, had lived in the area for about 12 years and had been working in the real estate industry. \nA coronial inquest into the pair’s death, held in Bathurst on Tuesday, heard they had been in a relationship since September 2011, and that Ms Cameron had discussed leaving Mr Issa more than two years before the incident. \nAdvocate assisting the coroner Paul Bush said Mr Issa was known to be controlling and jealous in their relationship, and would not let his partner see friends or go to social functions. \nMs Cameron’s father had died in a car accident in June 2015, which the inquest heard prompted her mood to change quickly, and later that month she ended the relationship with Mr Issa. Pair met at Mr Issa’s home to discuss relationship \nThe inquest heard that on the night of the incident, the pair had planned to meet at Mr Issa’s home to discuss the future of their relationship. \nSergeant Bush said Mr Issa shot Ms Cameron four times before shooting himself, after trying to convince her to remain in a relationship with him. \nDetective Sergeant James Allan, who was in charge of the investigation, was the only person who gave evidence at the inquest. \nHe said Mr Issa’s controlling nature was a motivating factor behind the shooting, and Mr Issa had planned to kill Ms Cameron if she refused his advances. Mr Issa was a well-known businessman who owned a popular cafe in the CBD. (Facebook) \nDuring cross examination, Detective Sergeant Allan said the murder was premeditated, as Mr Issa had asked a friend who had been staying with him to leave the house, saying, “I just need to sort some stuff out with Nadia”. \nHe said depression may also have been a factor, as Mr Issa took two mental health tests in 2012, with the second one recording him as being in the “extremely severe range” of depression. \nThe inquest heard there was no record in his medical files of any further treatment following the tests. \nDetective Sergeant Allan said Mr Issa likely shot himself to avoid prosecution or embarrassment. \nMs Cameron’s son, Jordan, told the inquest his mother was “elegant, stylish and popular” and that she had made “huge sacrifices”, including allowing him to move to the Central Coast to live with his dad and further his education. \nHe said he wished she had not been taken away in such a “selfish, violent” way. \nCoroner Michael Allen said he was satisfied with the evidence that Ms Cameron died after being shot by Mr Issa, who then killed himself. \nMr Cameron’s step-sister, Debbie Majella Nolan, has previously called for more education to make people more aware of the signs of an abusive relationship.
