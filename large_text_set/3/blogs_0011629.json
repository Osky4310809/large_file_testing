He was released a short time later on a $100,000 bond. He told reporters outside the jail after being charged that he would have a comment soon. But on Friday afternoon, he still had not commented, and he did not respond to email messages or telephone calls to multiple numbers associated with him. An operator at the state legislature building said no one was in his office, and it could not be determined whether he had a defense lawyer. \nAdvertisement   It has been a staggering rise and fall for Mr. Shortey, who was 28, unemployed and living on his wife’s savings when he first ran for office in 2010, winning as an underdog. Representing an urban area in southern Oklahoma City, he depended on volunteers from his Baptist church for campaign help and made the centerpiece of his platform a promise to protect families. \nAdvertisement   He vowed to crack down on illegal immigration, calling undocumented workers a threat to families and comparing them to terrorists . He said he would fight to restrict abortion, saying his advocacy was cemented after his family’s second child, a girl, survived a breached birth. “We need a leader who, as a parent, truly understands the urgency and priority of caring for God’s little ones,” he wrote on his campaign website . \nAdvertisement   In the past six years in the Legislature, he became a dependable champion of conservative causes. Randy Rose, a retired Oklahoma City firefighter who ran as a Democrat against Mr. Shortey in 2010, said he became friends with him after the election and they met every so often, including three weeks ago, to discuss how to help firefighters. “He was kind of a like a big giant teddy bear,” Mr. Rose said in an interview. “He was a young guy and inexperienced, but I think he was trying.” \nAdvertisement   A year ago, Troy Stevenson, the executive director of Freedom Oklahoma , a gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group in the state, said he was searching for a state senator to help stop proposed legislation that would have required schools to provide separate bathrooms for students who objected on religious grounds from sharing restrooms with transgender students. The night before it was to come before a Senate committee, Mr. Stevenson said he approached Mr. Shortey and urged him to vote against it. He said Mr. Shortey told him that he could not openly defy his Republican colleagues but promised to leave the room during the vote so the bill would have less chance of passing. “He showed up in the chamber and voted for the bill,” Mr. Stevenson said. “It was pure hypocrisy.” \nChristine Hauser contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:35:23.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
