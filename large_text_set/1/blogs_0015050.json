Not quite a one horse town, more like a horse and a donkey. Everyone know everyone. Our Main Street is occupied by Mom and Pops that greet you by your first name when you stop in for a burger and fries. Yet, even our own little slice of Mayberry on Earth is not immune to Evil . \nEvil came to our town this week. \nEvery Sunday, on my way to the grocery store, I stop in at a tiny restaurant by the store. I go there often enough that they don’t necessarily greet me by name but by my usual order: hot sour soup with a slice of lemon. \nA young married couple runs the little place. As I sip my soup, their little girl runs around the floor with boundless energy and an endless laugh. She comes over and talks to me. I show her photos on my phone of my pet deer Dillie and she laughs some more. She tells me her name, Ashley. Then she’s off like a shot to say hello to the one other diner at the handful of tables. \nI smile as watch her twirling in her little red dress and hear her laugh. Seeing a child so sweet and happy is like watching a dramatic sunset or strolling in a lovely, fragrant flower garden. It’s one of the joys of life, one of those fleeting moments of pure beauty and serene joy that say with you forever. Not even Evil can destroy the beauty of a moment like that. \nOr so we thought. \nLast week, the mother of that sweet little girl, that precious child, murdered her. Beat her to death. She was five years old, and her mother beat her to death. Afterward, her father wrapped her in a trash bag and buried her unceremoniously in a Tupperware bin full of powdered sugar, and stashed her tiny body in their restaurant freezer. Then, they nonchalantly opened their restaurant and served patrons all day, going in and out of that freezer all day long. . At the close of business, they called 911 with a bogus story, saying the child had wandered out the back door some time that evening. \nOur entire town, both the horse and the donkey, responded immediately. That night, in seven degree weather, our entire police and fire department searched for that child like she was their own. As far as they were concerned, she was. They used drones and search dogs and called in the biggest dog of them all, the FBI. \nWord swept through the town. Everyone was on the watch for this baby. We all took solace in the fact that our small town police had not small-towned the investigation. That child’s disappearance was handled like she was the most important person in the world. For that moment, she was just that. \nAfter searching the frozen landscape all night, the trained instincts of the police kicked them in the guts. They knew there were cracks forming in the parents ’ story that were beginning to widen like the San Andreas fault. The police dismantled the restaurant and found the bin housing the tragic truth. \nToday is the Sunday after this horrific event, and I am on my way to the grocery store again. The parents are in jail under a five million dollar bond. A closed sign is on the door of the restaurant where I last saw this little girl twirling and laughing . A mound of pink teddy bears, flowers, and balloons is in front of the familiar door. We are all grieving the loss of this child. \nThings like this aren’t supposed to happen in Mayberry. Evil changed us. Evil stole our innocence. \nI am a person that always makes lemonade from the bushels of lemons life throws me. A cold, grey January Ohio day is one day closer to the first flowers of Spring. Another embarrassing loss by our hapless football team is just one more step to rebuilding the team. Four harrowing years of chemo was my time in the world’s most expensive hair salon. Lots and lots of lemonade. My middle name should be Minute Maid. But, I am struggling to find any sweetness in this story of little girl lost, this bitter fruit. The only drop of nectar I see is that my town has taken this child to their hearts and is holding her, protecting her, comforting her in death the way they never could in life. I am so proud of my fellow Mayberrians and the love we show eachother and this tiny stranger. Evil cannot take that from us. \nWe’ll never know what gifts little Ashley would have given to our world. Maybe she would have been an artist. Or a doctor. Or maybe she would have traded in her little red dress for a tutu at the American Ballet Theatre. Maybe she would have had the most important role of all, a loving mother – the very thing that fate so cruelly denied her. I am grieving like the rest of our town. I was compelled to vent that grief in the only way a writer can. My words are my tears. Yet, even when I think of that little child pirouetting in her red dress, I smile. The joy she brought the world lives on. She never got to read Keats, but she taught us his poetry. A thing of beauty is indeed a joy forever. Rest now, sweet angel, rest.
