During the holiday season, Brian McBride can only hope Sebastian Giovinco remains in MLS long-term. ESPN FC's Sebastian Salazar speaks with Sebastian Giovinco concerning his fitness and the hype building up to MLS Cup. \nSebastian Giovinco's agent says he has received a \"huge offer\" for the playmaker from a club in China, though Toronto FC has not had any contact over transfer discussions. \nGiovinco, who turns 30 this week, has enjoyed massive success in Major League Soccer, scoring 43 league goals in two seasons and winning the 2015 MVP award. \nAnd his prowess has caught the attention of an unnamed Chinese Super League club, Andrea D'Amico told Sky Sport Italia on Tuesday. \n\"He received a huge offer from China,\" D'Amico was quoted as saying. \"We need to analyze the situation. But it won't be easy to make Toronto let him go. \n\"We received an important offer from China and we'll talk to Toronto to decide, along with Sebastian, what to do.\" Toronto FC appears unlikely to sell Sebastian Giovinco despite his agent revealing interest from China. \nDespite the agent's comments, a Toronto FC spokesperson confirmed to ESPN FC that the club has not received any bids from Chinese Super League teams, as earlier reported by the Toronto Sun and Sportsnet . \nA source also confirmed that the MLS league office, which holds all players' contracts for the purpose of international transfers, has not been contacted about a potential deal. \nAsked about his status in Toronto earlier in the day, Giovinco told reporters he was content. \n\"When I was back in Italy my friends ask me about MLS,\" Giovinco said, according to TSN . \"I say I am happy, I like it here.\" \nThe Chinese Super League has recently handed out some giant contracts, with Carlos Tevez and Oscar signing major deals. But this month the Chinese Football Association said it would limit the number of foreign players permitted to play in the 2017 season and threatened to ban clubs who overspent on players . \nESPN FC's Doug McIntyre and Jeff Carlisle contributed to this report. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T02:27:19.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
