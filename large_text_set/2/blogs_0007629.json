The larger trailers improve the economic feasibility of hauling logs from more remote areas. This is especially true of timber damaged by the mountain pine beetle, which producers may not have chosen to bring to market previously due to the cost of transporting them longer distances. (flickr.com) \nTransportation accounts for about 50% of the forest industry’s costs and hauling logs costs an estimated $750 million each year. Maximizing vehicle payloads could reduce costs by $2 to $4 per cubic metre of wood harvested, including reduced fuel costs. \nThe lower fuel use will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, since forest-sector transportation produces about 640 million kilograms of CO2 emissions each year. Fewer logging trucks on the road also will contribute to improved road safety. \nGiven the heavier loads that these trailers can carry, each public road where truckers want to use the trailers must be reviewed and approved to confirm that it can handle the extra weight and that the trailers can traverse the route safely. Each truck/trailer also needs to be pre-authorized by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. \nThe Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has tested and approved an initial trucking route in the Vanderhoof/Fort St. James area. This route provides access to the Fraser Lake, Plateau and Isle Pierre sawmills. Currently, four nine-axle trailers are being used by truckers on that route. They also have been cleared to operate on forest service roads branching off from it by Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations engineers. \nThe B.C. government and FPInnovations (a not-for-profit organization that researches and supports sustainable innovation in the forestry industry) are currently evaluating another four major trucking routes where the larger trailers could be used. \nUp to 800 nine-axle trailers could be incorporated into logging operations in B.C., which would result in savings of $30 million to $40 million annually for B.C.’s forest industry. This project is one example of how government and industry are working together under Strong Past, Bright Future: A Competitiveness Agenda for British Columbia’s Forest Sector. The agenda contains 49 strategic actions to support the inter-related goals of healthy, resilient forests and a globally competitive and diverse industry that support stable communities and First Nations. \nThis project has been a collaborative effort involving the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations, FPInnovations and forestry partners that include Canfor, West Fraser and Tolko. \nSupporting innovation is one of the key ways the B.C. government is taking action to strengthen and grow rural communities. To further support the needs of rural communities and grow local economies, the Province will be releasing a Rural Economic Development Strategy in the near future.

That sort of commitment not only benefits the people of Vanderhoof, but the entire region. It’s an example of how ingenuity in rural B.C. can benefit B.C.’s larger economy.” \nDonna Barnett, Minister of State for Rural Economic Development – \n“More than 140 rural communities in B.C. depend on the forest sector for their economic livelihood. Any competitive advantage that helps bolster rural economic development is a positive step that benefits all British Columbians.” \nTodd Stone, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure – \n“Our government welcomes innovation and encourages the development of ideas that give our communities a competitive edge while improving road safety at the same time. I’m looking forward to seeing how this project evolves in the months to come.” \nPaul Stewart, business manager of P & H Supplies/FreFlyt Industries Ltd. – \n“FreFlyt Stretch Super B Trailers allow short-log haulers to improve their payload to the mills by delivering higher volume, all at nominal increase of expense.” (flickr.com)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:03:06.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
