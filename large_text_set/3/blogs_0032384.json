No decision on casting has been made. \nThe film will mark the first big-screen turn in a central role by Batgirl, who first appeared in the DC comic-book universe in the 1960s. The character is the alter ego of Barbara Gordon, daughter of Commissioner James Gordon and has a dramatic past: she was paralysed from the waist down by the Joker in Alan Moore’s controversial 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke , but regained her ability to walk 23 years later when DC rebooted her storyline in 2011 . Alicia Silverstone played the character in the poorly received 1997 film Batman & Robin . 1960s Batgirl, played by Yvonne Craig.

Whedon directed The Avengers (titled Avengers Assemble in the UK), the crossover film that brought together Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the Hulk, and its follow-up, Avengers: Age of Ultron . Both films were hugely successful, helping to create a blueprint for the superhero crossover film that DC is looking to replicate with its forthcoming Justice League film, released later this year. \nBatgirl is not the only female superhero receiving her own movie. In June, Warner Bros will release a Wonder Woman film , starring Gal Gadot, and has an all-female villains movie in production. Marvel are planning its own female superhero movie based on the character of Captain Marvel , with Brie Larson in the title role.
