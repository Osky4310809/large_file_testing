During a recent segment of the right-wing news show Fox & Friends , the network aired a clip of Waters speaking out against Donald Trump’s supporters and their often bigoted, discriminatory practices. Instead of commenting on the content of the clip, O’Reilly thought it would be, somehow, humorous (??) to attack Waters’ appearance, saying, “I didn’t hear a word she said. I was looking at the James Brown wig. Do we have a picture of James Brown? It’s the same wig.” You May Also Like Hair Kim Kardashian's \"Bobby Pin Hairstyle\" Is Coming Under Fire for Cultural Appropriation Co-host Brian Kilmeade laughed at the tactless comment, and added his own joke about James Brown, who died in 2006: “He’s not using it anymore. They just — they finally buried him.” Fortunately, Ainsley Earhardt — another co-host — stepped in to defend Waters, telling her male colleagues, “You can’t go after a woman’s looks. I think she’s very attractive.” O’Reilly then tried to backpedal, arguing he “didn’t say she wasn’t attractive,” but by then, the damage had already been done. Waters responded to the racially charged, gendered, and deeply offensive words of the two Fox correspondents on MSNBC’s All In With Chris Hayes on Tuesday afternoon, Business Insider reports. She fired back, “Let me just say this: I am a strong black woman, and I cannot be intimidated. I cannot be thought to be afraid of Bill O’Reilly or anybody. I’d like to say to women out there everywhere, don’t allow these right-wing talking heads, these dishonorable people, to intimidate you or scare you. Be who you are. Do what you do. And let us get on with discussing the real issues of this country.” She also Tweeted a similarly empowered missive. https://twitter.com/MaxineWaters/status/846894257222795265 Which is not to say Waters wants to sit around talking about her hair, or those insulting her hair, for one minute longer. The democrative democratic representative has been one of the leading voices in the movement against the discriminatory and alarming policies put forth by the Trump administration. And she has every intention of returning to that message. https://twitter.com/MaxineWaters/status/846560274945654784 Of course, this isn’t the first time O'Reilly's made ignorant jokes at the expense of women or people of color. As the Huffington Post reports , last year, O’Reilly said that Hillary Clinton would do better among non-white voters if she played music by soul group the O’Jays during a rally. He also blamed the Black Lives Matter movement for rising murder rates in 2016. While still offensive, O'Reilly's comments weren't surprising.
