The teenagers agreed to change their clothing and take a later flight, Guerin said, but the airline’s actions sparked a quick backlash on Twitter. \nActivist Shannon Watts of Denver tweeted that she witnessed Sunday’s events and questioned United’s decision to police women’s clothing. \nWatts said the girl’s father was allowed to board while wearing shorts and called the airline’s policy sexist. The father had shorts on. Two young women in leggings booted from flight and a girl had to put a dress on over leggings in order to board. https://t.co/sCCP01gWcA \n— Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 26, 2017 \nRegularly ticketed passengers are not subject to the same dress code and can wear leggings, Guerin said. But the airline was standing by its policy for pass travelers because they are essentially representing the company, he said. To our customers…your leggings are welcome!
