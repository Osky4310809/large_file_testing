We're on an equal footing next week and we need to make sure we come away with the three points. \n\"We go into every away game wanting to win and we went into Liverpool wanting to win, but it just didn't happen. \n\"It's the rub of the green. The luck will change for us if we keep performing against the top sides like we have done.\" poll loading Will Burnley finish in the top half? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T20:04:32.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
