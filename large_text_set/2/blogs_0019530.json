Chances are this bird can sing better than you, and you will need to accept that as fact. I wouldn’t be surprised if this bird got a three-album contract, that’s what we are dealing with.\nThis parrot who takes parroting to a new level, lives in South America and mostly speaks Portuguese, according to NME . But the bird has made an exception for Rihanna, mastering some lines from the singer’s 2013 collaboration with Eminem, “Monster.”\nCompare the samples above, perhaps with your eyes closed, and prepare to be blown away by this parrot’s pipes. Before you go making a request for your favorite Rihanna track, it’s important to know this bird only sings “Monster.” This parrot has found what it’s good at and it isn’t changing for anybody. We have to respect that.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:45:35.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
