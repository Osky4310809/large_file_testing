But these days, the gaggle of far-right lawmakers is hoping to work more as party power brokers, looking to shape legislation for the GOP that can get all the way to the president’s desk. \n“There’s clout, you know, especially in a unified government where you’re not going to be looking at necessarily making a piece of legislation more moderate and picking up Democrats,” caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told USA TODAY. “We’re well-aware of the numbers and I think it increases, I guess, our responsibility to be well-informed and making sure that we make good decisions.” \nThe Freedom Caucus consists of roughly 40 members — “roughly” because members can choose whether they want to make their membership public. And while Republicans have a majority in the House, it takes just a couple dozen lawmakers to rebel for the party to lose its majority on any given bill. \nCaucus members have exerted their influence before. The group — unhappy with compromises that former House speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, made with the Obama administration — was behind Boehner’s resignation in the fall of 2015. \nBut now the group is working closely with the new leadership under Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Ryan has put in place an open-door policy for all House Republicans and texts frequently with rank-and-file members. Meadows and other Freedom Caucus members attend weekly advisory board meetings with more moderate representatives from throughout the House GOP membership. \n“We’re working well with them. And they also see that as a block we can help propel a decision and we can also help stop legislation, so I think they want to work with us,” Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, told USA TODAY. \n“House Republicans are working as a team to now implement major provisions of our Better Way agenda rolled out last year, including Obamacare repeal and replace and tax reform,” Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said when asked about the speaker's relationship with the caucus. \nWithout the threat of former president Barack Obama’s veto, Republican lawmakers see a window to work together and get GOP-endorsed legislation signed into law under President Trump. And Freedom Caucus members want to put their imprint on what ends up in the bills. \nRead more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:09:18.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
