Femi Kuti \n“People need to have a sense of the reality in the northeast – from people walking around hungry to mothers with malnourished children,” Kuti said during his visit to Borno. \n“I hope more celebrities will visit and engage with their fans,” Kuti told the Thomson Reuters Foundation after accompanying the International Rescue Committee (IRC) on visits to local communities hosting the displaced and a health clinic. \n“Then more people will see what is going on, share it on social media, and put pressure on the government to do more.” \nBoko Haram’s insurgency has killed about 15,000 people and forced more than two million to flee their homes since 2009. \nThe Nigerian army, backed up by neighbours, has retaken most areas held by the Islamist militants. \nYet the jihadist group has stepped up attacks and suicide bombings in the past few weeks as the end of the rainy season facilitates movements in the bush. \nWhile calling on more support and aid for people in the northeast, Kuti said he was struck by the generosity of local communities towards those uprooted by the insurgency. \n“It is heartening to see so many displaced people welcomed into the homes of local families … and community elders offering to give up land to displaced for farming,” Kuti said. \nIn Maiduguri, which has seen its population almost triple to five million in recent years, there are signs a sense of normality is gradually returning to the city. \nThe curfew has been pushed back to 10 pm from 6 pm and clubs are packed and pulsating as DJs play the tunes of artists like Kuti and his late father Fela, the 1970s Afrobeat pioneer. \nYet there is still much to be done, and many people to help, before Maiduguri can be considered back to normal, Kuti said. \n“There are still so many young people who are displaced, who have lost their parents, who cannot go home yet. They cannot party, and it is them we must worry about the most.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T14:47:44.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
