This is also terrorism,\" the SHC remarked. \nConfirming the ban on entry of heavy traffic in the megapolis, DIG Traffic Asif Ejaz Sheikh, however, said that oil tankers, water tankers and vehicles with government contract will be exempted from it. \nHe said the heavy vehicles will only be able to move through the bypass outside the city, for which three routes have been fixed. \nThe traffic en route to New Karachi Industrial Area will get through the Super Highway, according to Karachi Traffic Police. Heavy vehicles will use Manzar Pump from National Highway and Jam Sadiq flyover from Daud Chowrangi. \nTraffic police officials said that Northern Bypass, RCD Highway and Mauripur Road will also be used for heavy traffic. 0 0 Entry of heavy vehicles banned in Karachi from 6am to 11pm   , Banned, Casualties, Heavy Traffic, Karachi, Dig Traffic Asif Ejaz Sheikh, Accidents, Casualties, Karachi Traffic Police, Sindh High Court.   \"Entry of heavy vehicles banned in Karachi from 6am to 11pm\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/136246-Entry-of-heavy-traffic-banned-in-Karachi-from-6am-to-11pm+geo%2FGiKR+%28Geo+Pakistan+- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-01T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:36:24.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
