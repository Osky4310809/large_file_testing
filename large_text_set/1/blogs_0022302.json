The goal: To establish a strong US presence in the region so that, in essence, the Asian signatories would not \"be left alone on a dark street with China\" and there would be collective bargaining power, among other benefits, including lowering tariffs and non-tariff barriers for imported goods among the signatory nations. \nBut reducing tariffs was not really the driving point of the TPP, since the economic benefit would have been minimal for the US -- it was about putting our country in the position of establishing trade rules in Asia and getting member states to comply with them, specifically as it related to intellectual property and patents of American corporations. \nAlso: Turnbull pushes TPP as Japan calls it 'meaningless' without the US | Robots need rights, and kill switches too, warn politicians | Plug car security holes before self-driving vehicles arrive | Intel, ARM forge foundry partnership in bet on manufacturing prowess \nPulling out of the TPP will almost certainly have the opposite effect on China than what President Trump intends -- which presumably is to stem the flow of jobs and manufacturing and money to foreign nations. \nInstead of punishing China, it now puts them firmly in the driver's seat in the Asia-Pacific region when it comes to trade. \nPulling out of the TPP is just the first step in what will likely be more aggressive steps by the Trump administration to make importation of foreign-made goods unattractive. Almost certainly, larger tariffs are going to be in store for China. \nTrump wants iPhones made in the United States, not in Shenzen and Chengdu. At a fundamental level that's not a bad thing. We all want to increase skilled labor jobs in this country. \nUnfortunately, while we might realize some domestic production of the kind of sophisticated manufactured goods that line the aisles of CES every year, it may have a negligible impact on the job market. \nYou see, the goods are likely to be made by robots. special feature AI, Automation, and Tech Jobs \nThere are some things that machines are simply better at doing than humans, but humans still have plenty going for them. Here's a look at how the two are going to work in concert to deliver a more powerful future for IT, and the human race. Read More \nWhile China has a lower cost of labor than the US, and has tremendous government subsidies in various industries, costs in that country for manufacturing are increasing substantially. Rising costs have prompted companies like Foxconn, the primary contract manufacturer of the iPhone, to deploy fully automated manufacturing methods. \nAs of December 2016, the Taipei-based manufacturer -- with major plants in Shenzen, in Guangdong province in southern China; Chengdu in Sichuan province in Western China; and Zhengzhou in Henan province in Northern China -- has deployed over 40,000 homegrown \"Foxbots\" and it intends to replace most of its human workforce with them. \nFoxconn is considering opening a plant in the United States specifically to make displays, as it now owns Japanese electronics firm Sharp, following completion of a $3.5 billion acquisition in August of 2016. \nAt an estimated cost of $7 billion, the display manufacturing facility would employ as many as 50,000 people. On paper that is, at least according to the company's CEO, Terry Gou. \nGiven the company's accelerated trend towards automation in China, I am under no illusion that Foxconn will not do the same thing in the US. That 30,000-50,000 job figure is almost certain to fall dramatically. \nPerhaps the robotic factories that Foxconn wants to build will need skilled technicians to keep the coffee break-free automated workers running smoothly. But how many does each factory need? A few thousand at most, if that. \nCertainly with the advancement of 3D printing and rapid prototyping, the most skilled people don't actually have to be based in the US, and there are a lot of economies of scale that come into play. \nWhere stuff is made will have no real bearing on where the jobs are. \nBut surely they need people to run the distribution and transportation side, right?
