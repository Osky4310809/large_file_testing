It's almost like they're really brother and sister. Shares \nA new Mass Effect , with a new cast of characters, naturally means new voice actors. Heading up the cast this time around are Tom Taylorson and Fryda Wolff, the voices of Scott and Sara Ryder, who recently took a few minutes to talk about what it was like working together on the game. Sibling Rivalry with Tom Taylorson & Fryda Wolff https://t.co/bGxfigECAFThe space twins cometh, March 21st. Brace thy girdles. January 5, 2017 \nIt's a brief video, but it hits some interesting highlights. Fryda appears to have a competitive streak that borders on the unhealthy, while Tom is apparently afraid of sex. Or maybe he's just shy, it's hard to say. \nEither way, I can't imagine that this particular strain of sibling rivalry will actually make it into Mass Effect: Andromeda, but it'd be a lot of fun if it did. \nBioWare also released a good whack of new screens yesterday, and a new gameplay trailer last night during the Nvidia keynote at CES. And we finally got a release date , too: Mass Effect: Andromeda will be out on March 21 in North America, and March 23 in Europe.
