HBL is the settlement bank of SCT. The bank said is working to open a yuan-based settlement account at Bank of China. \nAccording to Malla, they have planned to issue the SCT-UnionPay co-branded cards in May this year. With the partnership with SCT, UnionPay will enable foreigners, particularly Chinese tourists, who visit Nepal to draw necessary cashes through ATM counters of 52 banks and other financial institutions in Nepal. \nOn the other hand, the HBL said they were in final phase of issuing yuan-based pre-paid travel cards. \"We are in the final testing phase of the cards with UnionPay,\" said Ujjal Rajbhandary, deputy general manager of HBL, who oversees the card-related businesses. \n\"If things go as per the plan, we should be able to issue renminbi-based cards in the next two months.\" \nHBL is the first Nepalese bank to issue UnionPay cards in Nepal and it has so far issued around 1,000 such cards. \n\"People still have tendency to carry cashes instead of cards but using UnionPay card in China is very easy,\" said Rajbhandary.
