Soulja Boy and Chris Brown are still on the same bullsh*t they were on in 2016. The former friends are now fighting on social media over Emmy-award winning actress Karrueche Tran, and it’s getting out of control. \nAs we all know, Breezy dated Karrueche up until March 2015 when Kae dumped him for cheating and having a break baby . Well, Chris wants that old thing back because he’s been leaving comments and emojis under Kae’s thirst traps for a few days now. One person also leaving heart eye emojis is Soulja Boy.\nYoung Draco claims Chris Brown called his phone and threatened to kick his ass for double tapping on Karreuche’s bikini picture. “Chris Brown just called me and said he wanna fight me because I liked @karrueche picture on Instagram. This n**** a bitch.” And it was on from there as Soulja Boy continued tweeting, telling a “coked up” Breezy “to pull up” if he wanted to catch that fade. \n\nChris brown just called me and said he wanna fight me because I liked @karrueche picture on Instagram this nigga a bitch \n— Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) January 3, 2017 \nAye @chrisbrown pull up nigga I'll knock yo Bitch Ass out stop snorting so much coke nigga. FRUITS \n— Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) January 3, 2017 \nFuck @chrisbrown \n— Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) January 3, 2017 \nThat nigga @chrisbrown better not tweet shit with his pussy ass. He called my phone trippin so now I'm trippin Fuck nigga. Fruits! \n— Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) January 3, 2017 \nChris brown think he hard cuz he hit a woman. And jumped a fan at his house party on New Years lmao u can't fight Bitch do that shit to me \n— Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) January 3, 2017 \nChris bitch ass aint even trending no more. But I am lmao irrelevant ass woman beater. can't wait to see this fuck nigga don't shake my hand\n— Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) January 3, 2017 \n\n\nChris, who’s been off probation since 2015, responded with an Instagram story and accused Soulja Boy of being a snitch. Last month, Soulja was arrested for violating his probation by carrying guns. He was released a day later. “You on probation for weapons and all that gangsta sh*t you talk about and you get out less than 24 hours later? You told!,” Chris accused.\nSoulja Boy hit back with another video and said his high-priced lawyer got him out of jail and that he was ready to fight Chris. “This Fruit Town Piru, n****. You ain’t even good in the hood, n****. We from the same hood, n****. On Bompton. When I see you, you catching that fade. You got me fucked up.” Just want to say that Soulja Boy was raised in Atlanta, Georgia, while Chris was born and raised in Virgina. So…. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nAll that gang talk prompted Chris to share his own video of his “Fruits” gang friends with their gun collection. Chris’ friends denounced Soulja Boy’s claim that he’s from “the hood” and reps their Bloods gang. “Cut it! You ain’t from the hood, you ain’t came to the hood, you ain’t do none. Stop it.” \nNow Chris is asking Soulja Boy to meet him in the boxing ring if he’s serious about getting a “grown man ass whopping.” Sigh.\nVideo below.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T15:50:07.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
