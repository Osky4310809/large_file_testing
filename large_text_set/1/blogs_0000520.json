If so, then Soccerway’s weekly betting guide could be for you. \nFor the past 15 weeks the best betting minds behind the site have been putting together a free document to examine the upcoming matches from around the globe and highlight which selections may be of interest. \nThere is a new edition due for release on Friday January 6 and the first guide of 2017 promises to be a valuable resource to bettors who are looking to use information to influence their weekend activity. \nEdition 14 of the Soccerway guide was the most successful in the publication’s short history, landing a second 9/1 (10.0) accumulator of the campaign as well as eight other stats-based winners. \nThe picks cover several areas from head-to-head records, current form, goal time analysis and much more. There’s also a look at the latest Opta facts and what they can add to the betting landscape. \nThe weather claimed several of the fixtures on the shortlist for last week’s guide but there were still a handful of winners, including a 6/4 (2.50) shot for the Old Firm meeting between Rangers and Celtic. \nWith coverage of the upcoming FA Cup third round as well as analysis of the Football League plus picks from Serie A, La Liga and beyond, the new release is not to be missed. It’s available free to all Soccerway members and will be distributed by email as soon as it’s released. Some of the teams covered include Roma, Barcelona and Napoli, plus there's another accumulator for those who are chasing a bigger return for their wager. \nMissed the mail or prefer to read a copy online?
