The episode airs tonight, and well, we can say it is not the best one. The most exciting moment of the episode came around the climax. The host Karan Johar reveals that he wants Kareena to co-host Koffee with Karan with him. \nThis was Kareena’s fifth appearance on the popular talk show. She has been coming as a guest on the show since season 1. And season after season she has given MEMORABLE quotes, some of which even shaped the fate of Bollywood. I mean why do you think we never got to see Kareena and John Abraham work in a film together? A little credit goes to Koffee with Karan! The actress also doesn’t deny that she has been on the show way too many number of times, and takes proud in it. She goes on to tag herself as “legend”, or as corrected by Karan, a “Koffee Legend”. Host Karan says, as he wraps up the episode, that he wants Kareena to keep coming on the show as long as it runs. “I hope till the time I host this show, you are always the guest. And one day I aspire you to co-host the show with me.” he concludes. So, is this a hint? We are totally on-board for a Koffee with Karan season 6 co-hosted by Kareena Kapoor Khan. Gracing the couch with Kareena was Sonam Kapoor – who might as well have given the show a miss. Seriously, if the episode is re-edited and you remove all the chunks of Sonam, it will still retain its essence. Also Read: Karan Johar calls Kareena a ‘pregnant stalker’ and the reason might shock quite a few actresses \nKaran Johar has made us dream. And now he better make it come true. How has anyone not thought of this yet? A chat show co-hosted by Kareena and Karan. There would be so much gossip, so much fire. Kareena just replies to idea by exclaiming “Oh God! Impossible”. Don’t break hearts of your ardent fans like this Kareena! One can still hope. Karan Johar is no less than a fairy who can make things happen in the industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T18:47:09.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
