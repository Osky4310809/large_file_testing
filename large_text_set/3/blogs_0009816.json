Even as we speak, set buildings, costume designers and trauma specialists are snapping into action, the better to bring you even more upsetting episodes, all because of your reputed enthusiasm for this grim so-called family programming. \nI hope you’re happy. Because you won’t be, ever again. \nWith all due respect, \nLemony Snicket \nThe series, which premiered in January, drew high praise from many critics, including Variety ‘s own Sonia Saraiya , who wrote, “Tonally, ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ is a weird, wonderful masterpiece — a self-consciously droll gothic dramedy that might be what would happen if Wes Anderson and Tim Burton decided to make a television series about children together.” Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T19:09:47.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
