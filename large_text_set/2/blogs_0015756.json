It’s perfect just the way it is. The American League, the National League differences are perfect right where they are. I don’t think we need to change the game of baseball. It’s a great game. It’s a beautiful game.” \nEvidently, many of his peers agree. \nDuring a media gathering in Arizona, commissioner Rob Manfred said there would be no significant rule changes for 2017. He added “unfortunately.” To reporters present, Manfred detailed how the players’ union was “uncooperative” during discussions on rules, and he added that a year from now some of those changes could be unilaterally imposed by Major League Baseball, per the new CBA. \nThere is little support in the game for a runner to start at second base in extra innings — one idea floated — but shifting or shrinking the strike zone is on deck for 2018. A pitch clock has been experimented with at lower levels, and Major League Baseball officials have explored the idea of limiting visits to the mound. Eliminating the four pitches for an intentional walk also might get approval. \nThe goal of such changes is often misunderstood as reducing the time of game. In truth, the commissioner’s office has made it a goal to quicken the pace of games. The idea is that a smaller strike zone — raised from the hollow of the knee, to the top — would create more action. \n“People will say that it’s not that big of a difference. It’s only 2 inches or so,” Wainwright said. “Well 2 inches is the difference between a home run and a grounder to short a lot of times. … That rule, to me, does not make sense as far as speeding up the game. The thought process is that with more balls in play there will be more outs, but those are different types of pitches. If you bring it up that’s where these guys want the ball. So there are going to be more doubles and homers. I know fans like action. But it’s not going to speed the game up because what pitchers are going to do in a reaction to it is they’re going to pick more. They’re going to nitpick more. They’re going to fall behind in the count. They’re going to walk guys.” \nAn elevated strike zone would prove particularly problematic for the Cardinals, who annually lead the league in groundballs coaxed and have built a rotation around inviting meek contact. \nIn Phoenix, Manfred said the game has more inactivity during games than at any other time in history. He said he was “disappointed” the union would not agree to “modest” changes. Manfred stressed that his office will keep some of the proposals active, eyeing 2018.. \n“If you’re looking from a straight fan perspective and how we enjoyed watching baseball, I think people want to see an offensive game,” infielder Matt Carpenter said. “Any time you can increase the chances for a hitter’s success it’s good for the game. I know there are 25 pitchers in the clubhouse that would disagree with me. They already have all the advantages in the world. Now, if it was three balls and three strikes then we’d have some fun. That would be really, really fun.” Big Carp will visit \nThe year after his induction into the team’s Hall of Fame, former ace Chris Carpenter will return to the team this spring as a special instructor. Carpenter is scheduled to join the team late in spring training, and he’ll be in uniform and available to pitchers for advice. \n“This is something he and (manager) Mike (Matheny) discussed and we were able to work something out,” general manager John Mozeliak said. “He’ll spend a few days in uniform.” \nCarpenter, the last Cardinal to win a Cy Young Award, briefly served in Mozeliak’s front office before he left the team to attend to family matters. At his induction last season, Carpenter mentioned a hope to return to the game in some capacity but with two kids and a new wife, scheduling was going to be tricky. During his time on Mozeliak’s staff, Carpenter did visit minor-league clubhouses and spoke to prospects about competitiveness and his preparation. \nMozeliak, somewhat dryly, said his role will be “teaching pitching.” \nCarpenter will be one of the last of the alumni to arrive and guest-instruct at spring training. Willie McGee, an employee on Mozeliak’s staff, will arrive in time to work with minor-league campers, and Jim Edmonds will visit in early March. Bob Gibson is set to arrive around the time games start or soon after. Lou Brock is expected. The Cardinals are hopeful that Red Schoendienst and Whitey Herzog will be able to spend time in camp, too. Invitations are out. \nDerrick Goold", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:42:55.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
