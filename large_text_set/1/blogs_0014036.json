The Seahawks went on a 14-play drive that ended in a touchdown, and the Falcons also had a scoring drive, theirs taking 13 plays.\nThe final play of the Falcons’ drive was this touchdown pass to Julio Jones :\nThe play might have looked similar to Seahawks fans, because it’s the same pick route that the Seahawks ran in Super Bowl XLIX against the Patriots when Malcolm Butler intercepted the pass to seal the victory.\nIt was a nice little troll job by the Falcons. In case you are wondering, the pick play is absolutely legal. It is legal to pick, as long as it happens within one yard of the line of scrimmage in the NFL.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:34:08.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
