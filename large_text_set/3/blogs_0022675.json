It will cost ¥4800 (about £35 or $43).\nAs reported by Gematsu , Seiken Densetsu 2 and 3 will support up to three-player multiplayer, while new features will include a quick-save option and the ability to listen to any of the games' music from the home menu.\nWith any luck an English version of the collection will makes its way to western shores. At the least, the Switch is region free, so importing is an option for Japanese-speaking players.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/60tMD5TDQog", "http://gematsu.com/2017/03/seiken-densetsu-collection-announced-switch"], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:53:46.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
