As it uses the main Opera servers to compress pages, it offers you the possibility to use only a tenth part of the data that the rest of browsers use . All the latter with a very well-kept interface and with a panoramic view and zoom that makes it easier to browse in a more intuitive and natural manner . Great features for an excellent web browser \nIts appealing features include browser synchronization and quick access to any computer and mobile device via Opera Link, as well as including Facebook and Twitter to quickly share any contents. \nWith Opera Mini on your Android device you'll enjoy a much more comfortable and optimized browsing experience. Requirements and additional information: The version, size and requirements of Android vary depending on the device. The installation of the app by means of the APK file requires the activation of the \"Unknown sources\" option within Settings>Applications.
