Future (in hoodie) on the Falcons sideline \nSeattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, his wife Ciara, and Future have a bit of a history together. So the speculation ran rampant that when the Seahawks came to town, the Falcons would play Future’s music over the Georgia Dome speakers to get in Wilson’s head. \nThey’re not doing that. But Future’s on the Falcons sidelines anyway, so … it’s a push? \nThe celebrity-gossip portion of this story is as follows: Ciara and Future were briefly engaged, and had a child together, but that relationship fractured. Ciara later met and eventually married Wilson. Ciara also reportedly filed a defamation suit against Future. And this past summer, Future allegedly posted some threatening emojis (footballs and guns), though he denies doing so: \n“Nah, I didn’t do that,” he sad in an interview with The Breakfast Club . “They thought I did that. [Seeing him with my kid], it will make you feel a way, but not to the point where I’m putting emojis on a Facebook. It was a fake Facebook page. They put it on media. She even thought it was real! She got lawyers start calling about that. It got serious for something I wouldn’t even do.” \nSo, yeah: no love lost there amongst these three. You’d expect a football team in the heat of the playoffs to look for every advantage, but when asked whether the Falcons would go for the jugular and try to get into Wilson’s head, literally, Quinn was emphatic : “We will absolutely not go down that road.” \nIt’s worth noting, however, that the Carolina Panthers did indeed go down that road in the playoffs last year: They got Future tracks in rotation #PantherNation pic.twitter.com/dgwRfPjrxa \n— National Champions! (@iCantGetWright) January 17, 2016 \nBut the Falcons saw the Panthers playing Future’s music, and raised them the actual Future, on the Falcons sideline, less than an hour before game time: Future is here, Falcons fans https://t.co/IxT7Wwrnrz pic.twitter.com/xIrqSO24wU \n— vaughn mcclure (@vxmcclure23) January 14, 2017 \nYeah, that’s some high-level ATL gamesmanship. Still to be determined whether or not it works. ____ Jay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports and the author of EARNHARDT NATION , on sale now at Amazon or wherever books are sold.
