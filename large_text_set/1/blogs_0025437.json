But the climax was more cruel than vivisection. View gallery \nTwo goals from skipper Paul Hayes and a soaring header from sub Garry Thompson gave Spurs all the headaches they could handle. \nSpurs players had warmed up in No.8 shirts bearing the legend 'Get Well Soon Ryan' as a tribute to their former team-mate Ryan Mason, who remains in hospital after suffering a fractured skull in Hull's 2-0 defeat at Chelsea last weekend. \nBut after being led out by manager Gareth Ainsworth's son, Kane, as mascot, Wycombe led Tottenham a merry dance from the first minute as Adebayo Akinfenwa headed Sido Jombati's deep cross back across goal and Chairboys skipper Paul Hayes headed against the bar when he should have scored. \nSon's radar was also on the blink as he dragged wide of an open goal for the home side, and midway through the first half it became an expensive miss. \nJoe Jacobson's right-wing corner reached the far post and Hayes atoned for his earlier miss with a sublime left-foot volley beyond Michel Vorm. Dele Alli struck late to deny the Chairboys (Photo: REUTERS) \nAnd Wycombe were in dreamland nine minutes before the break as Sam Wood was brought down by a naïve challenge from Cameron Carter-Vickers and Hayes doubled their money from the penalty spot. \nIt should have been 3-0 within a minute, only for Akinfenwa to head wide from six yards, and Spurs – unbeaten at the Lane this season - were booed off at the interval by a disbelieving crowd. \nInevitably, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino sent in the cavalry, and two goals in four minutes restored business as usual. \nFirst Son's deflected shot beat Jamal Blackman at his near post to reduce the deficit after an hour, which was the cue for Poch Spice to send on midfield aristocrats Dele Alli and Mousa Dembele. \nAnd when Aaron Pierre checked half-time sub Vincent Janssen in the box, the Dutchman picked himself up to level the tie confidently from the spot. \nBut what a fabulous performance from the Chairboys. In the very best of Cup traditions, they took Spurs to the wire. Garry Thompson thought he'd won it for Wycombe before Alli's equaliser (Photo: REUTERS) \nHere are five things we learned: 1. Sissoko stuck on autopilot \nThere is a world of difference between a European Championship final and thankless Cup assignments when you're on a hiding to nothing. \nMoussa Sissoko might have looked a £30 million player when he raised his game for France last summer, but on this evidence you can see why Mauricio Pochettino has been unable to trust his big-money summer signing. \nJust as he went missing too often for Newcastle as the Toon slipped through the relegation hatch last season, Sissoko was a strolling aristocrat for 45 minutes as Wycombe threatened to bridge the 70-place gap between the teams. Moussa Sissoko failed to impress (Photo: REUTERS) 2. Janssen in the dark \nNow Vincent Janssen can't even get in the starting line-up when League Two minnows come calling at White Hart Lane. \nIt would be fair to say Janssen's Tottenham career has not yet taken off. In fact, it has not even left the departure gate, let alone the runway. \nIf manager Mauricio Pochettino was sending Harry Kane's £18 million understudy a coded message among his nine changes from the side who salvaged a 2-2 draw at Manchester City, it was surely along the lines of: Now, where did I put the receipt? \nBut Poch Spice had seen enough, after 45 minutes of remarkable complacency, to send for the Dutchman in place of Georges-Kevin Nkoudou, and his fourth penalty of the season made it 2-2 as Tottenham fought back after a slipshod first half. Janssen scored from the spot (Photo: AFP) 3. Akinfenwa is an absolute best \nFor all the cheap shots about his 16st frame and, ahem, physical attributes, Adebayo Akinfenwa has scored 169 goals in his career for a reason. \nThe 'Beast' was never going to tiptoe around White Hart Lane and exit the Cup with a whimper if he could enjoy a good stomp, and England star Eric Dier didn't need a warning klaxon to know when Akinfenwa was around. \nIt was the Beast whose header set up a glorious chance for his captain Paul Hayes in the first minute and, as ever, if Wycombe were looking for a target man, they could hardly miss him. Adebayo Akinfenwa gave Tottenham all they could handle (Photo: Dan Istitene) 4. Spurs home before the postcards \nTottenham's four-day warm-weather training camp in Barcelona almost backfired on them. \nThere is plenty of evidence on film to show Spurs pulled their weight in the 1992 Olympic stadium after Mauricio Pochettino decided to escape the grey chill of an English winter – nice work if you can get it – but his much-changed side played for 45 minutes as if they had not finished writing their postcards. Tottenham's warm weather training didn't pay off (Photo: Harry Kane / Instagram) 5. Ainsworth destined for bigger job \nOn the day his son was a mascot, Gareth Ainsworth went through one of his most memorable 90 minutes as a manager. \nWycombe were 25 seconds from promotion two years ago until Southend's stoppage-time equaliser in the League Two play-off final at Wembley took the game to penalties, where the Shrimpers prevailed. \nBut Ainsworth has worked miracles on a pauper's budget at Adams Park, and surely there has to be a job higher up the scale for a manager who plays in a band called Dog Chewed The Handle. poll loading Will Tottenham win a trophy this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T19:18:58.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
