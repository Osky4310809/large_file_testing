Christian Broadcasting Network (!)Wow. \n— Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) February 15, 2017 Trump calls on Christian Broadcasting Network for staged question. #AmericanFascism \n— Pedro da Costa (@pdacosta) February 15, 2017 David Brody of CBN gets the first question. Gutless @realDonaldTrump won’t call on the mainstream media to ask a question. Scary stuff. \n— Jason Page (@TheBackPage) February 15, 2017 Advertisement - story continues below \nCNN’s Jim Acosta said Trump’s behavior was “no accident” and the “fix is in.” \n“The two questions that were asked or called upon from the president in this news conference went to the Christian Broadcasting Network, no accident, which is obviously owned by Pat Robertson, the televangelist down in Virginia,” said Acosta. “It’s a very conservative broadcasting network.” \nAchosta also labeled Townhall as “a conservative website.” \nAcosta also accused the White House of not wanting to take critical questions related to Trump’s closest aides, advisers and contacts.

People complain how Trump called on the Christian Broadcasting Network, but their reporter just smartly asked about both Flynn & settlements \n— (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) February 15, 2017 \nCNN Host John King claimed the president’s actions come at a time when the White House is “in crisis.” \n“You have a White House now that is in crisis,” said King. “And calling on conservative news outlets, fine. But it doesn’t answer questions the people should have. Questions that the American people, not just the news media, have.” \nTrump has often accused the media of treating him unfairly, both throughout his presidential run and since his inauguration. \nThe president tweeted Wednesday morning, taking aim at two of his most highly criticized media outlets, CNN and MSNBC. \n“The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracies and blind hatred,” he tweeted. “@MSNBC & CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!” What do you think?
