Francis Pangilinan said yesterday. \nPangilinan made the statement in response to the decision of the Duterte administration to have a low-key commemoration of the EDSA anniversary to “move on from the past.” \n“Why should we move on from that moment in history when, through our collective will, we regained freedom and restored democratic rule?” Pangilinan asked. \n“Regaining our freedom and ending the abuse and brutality of dictatorial rule should always be remembered by the nation,” he added. \nPangilinan said the spirit of EDSA is as important today as it was 31 years ago when Filipinos took to the streets to oust former dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a peaceful uprising. \nThe EDSA revolt should continue to be a source of pride, strength and inspiration, Pangilinan said.   \nSenate President Aquilino Pimentel III said he would always be a partner for change and would never abandon the dream of making life better for every Filipino. \nPimentel said that while not all the problems of the country were solved, the political climate produced by the EDSA revolution allowed the people to hold the government accountable for its failures. \nSen. Leila de Lima, in a statement, said the peaceful EDSA revolt garnered admiration, not only from Filipinos, but from the entire world. \nSen. Panfilo Lacson said the legacy of the EDSA uprising would never be taken away. \nHowever, he said that many questions remained unanswered 31 years after the revolution. \n“What has changed in the lives of the Filipinos? What has changed aside from the restoration of democracy? What else did we gain from the EDSA revolution?” Lacson said. Live the spirit of EDSA – Leni \nVice President Leni Robredo called on Filipinos yesterday to live the spirit of EDSA and continue believing in the power of the people. \n“Let us not be resigned to the evil that is happening. Let us acknowledge that real power lies in the hearts and minds of the ordinary Filipinos and we should harness it,” Robredo said. \nRobredo attended the mass organized by different groups at the La Salle Greenhills as part of the commemoration of the 31st EDSA anniversary. \nDuring a forum on People Power at the University of the Philippines on Friday, the Vice President called on the public to protect the freedom that the country obtained following the fall of the dictatorship. \n“The real success of EDSA was that it proved the power of the people: that when citizens come together in courage and in hope, we can be the change that we aspire for our country,” Robredo said. \nShe criticized the country’s leaders who she said attempted to revise history by letting the public forget the atrocities of martial law. \n“Some leaders are happy to glorify the Marcos dictatorship, to revise the history so that he is remembered as a hero and not the thief and murderer that he was. Some leaders want to raise the fist of authoritarianism, to sow fear and discord among ourselves, to divide us with lies, violence and bloodshed,” she said. \nRobredo called on the public to reject these lies and work toward achieving the objectives of EDSA. War on poverty \nRobredo took President Duterte to task, saying the continuing political bickering has diverted the government’s attention from solving the real issues such as poverty and joblessness. \n“In behalf of the Filipino people, we ask the President to focus on the war that really matters: the war on poverty. Our people are hungry, jobless and poor,” Robredo said. \n“Please use your leadership to point the nation toward respect for rule of law, instead of disregard for it; to uphold the basic human rights, instead of encouraging its abuse. Be the leader you promised to be, and stop the lies that are distorting the truth in our society today,” she added. \nMeanwhile, the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) urged the Duterte government to fulfill its promises of change. \n“This year’s EDSA anniversary happened amid a backdrop of repression and political crisis. Human rights violations and illegal arrests amid the drug war are on the rise,” Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes said. \nBayan joined other groups at a protest at the People Power Monument in Quezon City yesterday. \nThe Akbayan party-list group said the Duterte administration should be made accountable for anti-poor, violent and corrupt practices. – With Janvic Mateo, Non Alquitran, Rhodina Villanueva  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T09:39:21.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
