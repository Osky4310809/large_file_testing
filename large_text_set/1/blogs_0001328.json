That’s not the change we wanted,” Jones said apprehensively with a smile on his face. \nJones made some suggestions for potential leaders of the party. “I think you’re gonna be surprised at some of the people who become stars quickly. You have Kamala Harris from California. She is unreal,” Jones said excitingly. “She’s gonna be out there defending those DREAMer kids because they’re a big part of her constituency.” (RELATED: Kamala Harris Defeats Fellow Democrat To Win Barbara Boxer’s Senate Seat) \nJones also referenced Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison.
