Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool fringe player Daniel Sturridge has been urged to join Paris Saint-Germain by former England and Arsenal ace Ian Wright. \nSturridge isn't in Jurgen Klopp's first choice XI and Wright reckons a move abroad could help the ex-Manchester City and Chelsea man revive his career. \n“He should go somewhere else to revitalise himself. I’m not sure if that will happen in this country. He’s been at all the top teams but Arsenal,” Wright told The Sun. \n“You look at it and think somewhere like PSG that he might look at. I think he is fantastic. He is a super player. It isn’t going to happen for him at Liverpool.” Gerrard: We should sign Van Dijk \nSteven Gerrard believes Liverpool should attempt to sign Virgil van Dijk from Southampton - but reckons the Reds' record of poaching Saints' best players in recent years could count against them. Steven Gerrard reckons Virgil van Dijk would be a good signing for the Reds (Photo: Alex Livesey) \n\"Who I think we need, I would go and try and bid for Van Dijk from Southampton,\" Gerrard told BT Sport. \n“But we’ve had enough of their players so that will probably go down like a lead balloon.\" Klopp won't delve into transfer market this month \nIf the title run-in began this weekend - as Jurgen Klopp had claimed on Friday - then it ended too for his Liverpool side with their seismic home loss to bottom-club Swansea, writes David Maddock. \nThe question now is not whether the Reds can be champions in May, but rather, why they will not. \nAnd chief among the reasons offered by a disbelieving support is the lack of signings in this January window. View gallery \nMake no mistake, Saturday's 3-2 victory was something approaching a miracle from the Swans. Yet it always somehow seemed possible, given the Reds’ struggles against sides who defend deep and in numbers in recent weeks. \nThose calling for new faces to freshen up a squad missing key figures such as Sadio Mane, the back from injury but still tentative Philippe Coutinho and political pawn Joel Matip suggest the problem lies with excessive Anfield caution in the winter window. \nYet a pained Klopp, struggling to hide his disappointment after such a devastating defeat, explained that as much as he would have liked to call in the cavalry, the January window simply doesn’t lend itself to that sort of business. \n“I understand it is absolutely normal, people ask whether we should have brought players in – but it is not that we don’t want to bring players in. We do,” the Liverpool manager explained. \n“Yes, on the one side pretty simple. But on the other hand it is pretty difficult. The thing is, the players we want because we think they help us, the clubs don’t sell. It is not about money in this situation, it is the winter transfer window.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T11:19:03.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
