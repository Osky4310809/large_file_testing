He did, however, state outright that “President Trump is not trying to be a dictator,” so that’s a cool vote of confidence.\nAs the Daily Intelligencer suggests , McCain spends the brief interview talking out of both sides of his mouth. When articulating his concerns regarding the new administration, he avoids uttering Trump’s name. But when pressed by host Chuck Todd, McCain, albeit protractedly, admits that he lacks confidence in Trump’s “understanding of some of these issues and his contradictory articulations.” What McCain is referring to, specifically, is Trump’s perspectives on national security and foreign policy — particularly our relationship with Russia.\n\nTrump Defends Vladimir Putin By Arguing U.S. Is Not 'So Innocent' Either Trump Defends Vladimir Putin By Arguing U.S. Is Not &apos;So Innocent&apos; Either Trump Defends Vladimir Putin By Arguing U.S. Is… Donald Trump—an autocratic embodied Twitter egg who also happens to run the country—implicitly… Read more Read more \nTwo weeks ago, Trump spoke with Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly about Vladimir Putin’s reputation as “a killer,” to which he responded , “There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country’s so innocent?”\nAdvertisement \n\nAdvertisement \n\nAccording to McCain, drawing this “moral equivalency” between our two countries “[contradicts]...everything the United States has ever stood for in the 20th and the 21st century.” Moreover, he forebodes that implementing Trump’s European foreign policies—namely, breaking away from the “obsolete” NATO—“would upset the last 70 years of a new world order.”\nThese are strong words. One wonders why, if McCain harbors such negative sentiments, he voted to confirm all but one of Trump’s appointees. Collectively, these decisions do not cohere with his so-called “maverick” reputation, nor does his painfully ginger critique of the administration for which he seems to have such little respect.\n\nI Don't Want To Hear Another Fucking Word About John McCain Unless He Dies Or Actually Does Something Useful For Once I Don&apos;t Want To Hear Another Fucking Word About John McCain Unless He Dies Or Actually Does… I Don&apos;t Want To Hear Another Fucking Word About… John McCain—the original Maverick, ol’ Walnuts, the brave teller of truths—is somehow once again… Read more Read more \nTo be clear, I agree with much of what McCain has to say in his interview with Todd. But as Alex Pareene wrote on Friday, I see no evidence that significant action will follow. He has not condemned his party for docilely placating the new POTUS, nor has he supported the Democrats in their efforts to oppose tragically destructive Cabinet appointments like Betsy DeVos . He is even loathe to call Trump by name — to firmly hold him accountable for the chaos he has summoned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:50:22.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
