Sapphires Come in Almost Any Color Except Red \nSapphire is one of two gemstones composed of the mineral corundum.

Daniel d'Aix/Getty Images 3. Red Sapphire (Corundum) is Actually Ruby \nWhen trace amounts of chromium is found in corundum, the resulting color is either pink or red. This is where defining gemstones can get a little tricky. If the resulting color is a light pink shade, then the stone is considered a sapphire. If the resulting color is a deeper reddish pink shade, the stone is considered a ruby . Neo Vision/Getty Images 4. Sapphire is the Second Hardest Gemstone Next to Diamond \nJust like ruby, sapphire is ranked 9.0 on the Mohs scale , making it equal to ruby in terms of durability and second only to diamond that ranks 10.

Stephen J Krasemann/Getty Images 7. Most Sapphires are Heat Treated \nMost commercial grade sapphires have been heat-treated to enhance both color and clarity. The picture displayed here shows rough sapphire on the right prior to having undergone heat treatment. On the left you can see rough sapphire after it has been treated. It is much lighter and brighter in color. Some really high-quality sapphire that have not been heat treated command very high prices per carat. Rob Lavinsky, iRocks.com via Wikimedia Commons 8. Color Change Sapphire is Similar to Alexandrite \nSapphires with strong color change capabilities are among the rarest sapphires in existence. These sapphires act very similar to alexandrite in that they appear blue in natural lighting and purple in incandescent (light bulb/lamp) lighting. ProArtWork/Getty Images 9. Synthetic Sapphire was Created in 1902 \nSimulated sapphires made of glass have been around for hundreds of years, but synthetic sapphires that have the same chemical composition as a natural sapphire were invented in 1902. It can be very difficult to tell the difference between a natural and a synthetic sapphire, so if you plan on spending thousands on a sapphire, be sure it is accompanied with a gemological certification.
