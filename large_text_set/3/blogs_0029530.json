The board can't say nothing to me and if they do, I will go and get a licence somewhere else.\" \nHaye said after the fight that he expected to be fined for his pre-fight comments. \nThe ex-WBA heavyweight champion has said he intends on returning to the ring after recovering from Achilles surgery.
