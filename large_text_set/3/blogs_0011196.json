She was an MMA fighter in DIRECTV's Kingdom and a sheriff in Under the Dome , and plays a not-so-hapless victim in the home-invasion flick Keep Watching , out March 24. \n\"In this one audition I had, I was supposed to be a girl who got kidnapped,\" Martinez says. \"The director said I did great on the audition but that my portrayal seemed too capable. He was like, 'You seem as if you could have taken out the two guys who were snatching you.' I guess I just like being seen in that strong female lead. \nIt's her same mentality in the ring. \nOn a rainy Sunday afternoon, the actress is in West Hollywood's pedigreed Fortune Gym, a training venue for such boxing notables as Manny Pacquiao and Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. Martinez has studied boxing and martial arts for years. Here she's working on her flying knees, Superman punches, and jumping roundhouse kicks with her regular coach, former U.S. Muay Thai champion Johnny Hunt. \nThe benefits of a kick-ass workout go way beyond the physical. \"When I'm training regularly, I can see the difference in my life. My posture is different. My moods are better. I'm more calm and poised for auditions. I just feel so much happier,\" she says. \"And when I'm happy and training and have my mood, I'm untouchable.\" \nMost important, she adds, is finding a path to self-acceptance. \"You need to be honest with yourself, to accept your body, to accept yourself, both your talents and your limitations. Like, I'm a foodie. There are times when I'll work out and then eat a pizza right afterward because I deserve it. Life's too short to really deprive yourself. You have to find a healthy balance.\" \nWith that, Martinez climbs through the padded ropes and bounces her bare feet around the boxing ring, ready to kick some butt—and find some inner peace along the way. \nIf her workout in the video above inspires you to incorporate boxing into your own gym routine, try this workout. You'll quickly find out why kickboxers are some of the leanest, toughest, most graceful athletes you've ever seen. Kick It into Gear \nRound 1 (warmup) JUMP ROPE INTERVALS At a consistent pace, jump rope continuously for 3 minutes. (Don't worry if you get tripped up a few times.) Rest 30 seconds. Repeat 2 to 4 times, depending on your fitness level. \nRound 2 SHADOW-BOXING Keeping your stance loose and bouncing from foot to foot, deliver medium-strength punches and jabs for 3 minutes. Rest 30 seconds. Repeat 2 to 4 times. \nRound 3 HEAVY BAG Apply the same shadowboxing approach, varying the intensity of blows and circling the bag for 3 minutes. Rest 30 seconds. Repeat 2 to 4 times. \nRound 4 CORE CONDITIONING As a finisher, do 3 to 5 rounds of either standing medicine ball twists or mountain climbers—you choose. Rest 30 seconds after each round. \nWith additional reporting by Tyler Daswick", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:45:20.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
