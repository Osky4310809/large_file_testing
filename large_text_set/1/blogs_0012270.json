These new supplies of nuclear material originate from Pyongyang’s reprocessing of its spent fuel rods, the report says.\nAn unnamed defense ministry official told the Times that its conclusion came after South Korea and the U.S. “analyzed various aspects such as the operation situation of the North’s nuclear reactor.”\nThe ministry also suggests that Pyongyang is developing both intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, although the same defense official told the Times that the North’s ICBM capabilities have “yet to reach a reliable level.”\nRead More: American Tourism Might Be Helping North Korea’s Weapons Program \nThe report comes just days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said the country was “in the final stages of test-launching” ICBMs, which attracted a stern warning from the Pentagon .\nWith less than nine days to go until the next U.S. President assumes office, there are concerns that the incoming administration either has no solid plans to respond to Pyongyang’s advances in nuclear weaponry, or that it might inadvertently escalate the Korean Peninsula’s already contentious security situation.\nIn addition, Seoul also noted the further expansion of the North’s conventional armed forces in the white paper, reports the Korea Times . According to the white paper, total number of North Korean soldiers rose from 1.2 million to 1.28 million, and a unit engaging in cyber warfare has expanded from 6,000 members to 6,800.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T06:35:35.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
