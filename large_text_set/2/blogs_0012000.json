Trey Gowdy , R-S.C., noted Tuesday that their zeal has vastly changed now that the party holding the White House has also changed. \nGowdy, who chaired the House Select Committee on Benghazi, told Martha MacCallum of Fox News that his “colleagues have amnesia.” \n“I will say this,” he said. “They are very well rested because for eight years, they didn’t lift a finger to do oversight.” Advertisement - story continues below O’Reilly Critical Of Trump Administration’s Lack of Discipline \nDemocrats on Tuesday demanded select committees and special investigations related to Flynn’s connections to Russia and what kinds of information he may have given Russia before his Monday night resignation. Trey Gowdy: Democrats Took ‘An Eight-Year Long Vacation From Doing Oversight On The Exec. Branch’ [VIDEO] https://t.co/U9OEAQlEon pic.twitter.com/1Dzgk7HE7D \n— The Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) February 15, 2017 \n“All of that energy you saw today at their press conference, that is because they went on an eight-year long vacation from doing oversight over the executive branch,” Gowdy said. Advertisement - story continues below \nWhile agreeing there were unanswered questions, Gowdy made it clear there is a right way and a wrong way to pursue an investigation. \n“I am all for the committees of jurisdiction, looking into it. I am also for looking into how classified information can make its way into the public domain,” he said. \n“That is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. It’s a legal issue,” he added. \nThe issue of leaks was noted by commentator Andrew Mark Miller on Young Conservatives.

Was it the Obama machine? Was it someone on the Trump team? That’s far more important than this hysterical conspiracy theory the liberals are pushing about Trump and Russia,” he wrote. \nAlthough Democrats are claiming not enough attention has been paid to connections to Russia among President Donald Trump’s advisers and Russian influence on the elections, Gowdy said that’s not the case. \n“The Democrats may be new to this investigation. But the Republicans in the House, as it relates to Russia and their attempts to interfere in our elections, we’re not new to it,” he said on the Fox News show America’s Newsroom . \nGowdy said Democrats are more focused on “politics … than actually finding out what happened.” \n“We know they were messing around with it. We don’t think they had any impact on the outcome, but obviously we’re not going to ignore something like that,” he said. \nAsked whether there was evidence Russia impacted the election, Gowdy hedged. \n“I don’t think anyone knows. I’ve seen no evidence of it,” he said. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
