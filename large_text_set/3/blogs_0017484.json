Steve Rosenbloom .\nToo soon? \nI think it's a rule that we have to compare players, and i mean immediately. Failure to do so in my business could result in jail time, I believe. So, let's play the comp game in this giddy time for the Blackhawks . \nI could’ve gone Andrew Shaw there, but the 5-foot-9, 179- pound pony keg that is Shaw always comes with a threat of tapping some stupid. \nHayden, meanwhile, comes from Yale, so there’s no reason to fear weapons-grade idiocy. What’s more, his 6-foot-3, 223-pound frame is not just closer to Saad’s, but surpasses it. \nSaad is a man-child along the boards and going to the net, and early indications are Hayden is willing to go to the tough spots and make plays. \nIn his three NHL games, Hayden went scoreless in Ottawa on Thursday, scored a goal in the Hawks’ 2-1 win in Toronto on Saturday, and picked up the two primary assists on the two goals that helped the Hawks tie the Avalanche at 3-3 in a spectacular third period that would see the Hawks score five times Sunday. \nHayden’s five-on-five Corsi For percentage sits under 50 percent, according to NaturalStatTrick.com, but here’s the thing: He has yet to be on the ice for a goal against and the Hawks have had more high-danger scoring chances than they’ve allowed when he has been out there. \nIt’s worth noting that while trying to get the puck back, Hayden led the team with 12 hits last weekend. \nIf Hayden was tentative in making his debut in Ottawa last week, he’s looks past that now. Ivy League kid. Catches on quick. That’s a Hawks characteristic going back to 2009.

You also can say Hayden’s strong numbers come from playing with Jonathan Toews , but remember this: Toews and his linemates haven’t automatically had strong numbers all season. \nFirst, though, remember this: Stan Bowman ’s history of acquiring young talent. \nIn broad strokes, go back to Nick Leddy , draw a line to Teuvo Teravainen , put a star next to Artemi Panarin, underline Nick Schmaltz and Ryan Hartman, among other youngsters this season, and now circle Hayden’s name. \nIt never stops with Bowman. It can’t. Not when there’s a hard salary cap set by the NHL and a hard demand to win the Stanley Cup set every year by Bowman’s bosses. \nThe Hawks began this season with five rookies on the roster. They have used seven rookies to this point. They are in first place in the Western Conference . \nThe Hawks, do you hear me? The Hawks have done this while bringing seven rookies to a coach who allegedly hates kids, which has always been a lie because Joel Quenneville doesn’t hate kids, he hates mistakes. \nTo cite just one example, Schmaltz is one of the seven rookies to skate for the Hawks this season. He was sent back to Rockford to find confidence to make the right play instinctively, then he was recalled, and bang, his speed, vision, passing and eely ability to find spaces at center and on the wing on any line seems to be why laments about Teravainen don’t even echo these days. \nSo, back to Hayden, when I see the incoming talent and the growth of their games, even small growth in a short time, I’m going to think big until a player’s game tells me otherwise, same as I do with the Cubs, because, look, Bowman is hockey Theo Epstein. \nOr maybe it’s the other way around. Either way, it doesn’t take long to call roll in that club around here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:43:32.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
