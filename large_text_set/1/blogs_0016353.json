Tiny bit \nDoctors developed three-person IVF to help women who are at risk of passing on serious genetic disorders, called mitochondrial disease, to have a healthy child. \nEggs from a mother with unhealthy mitochondria and a donor with healthy mitochondria are collected. \nThe resulting babies that are made have DNA from three people - the mum, the dad and a tiny bit from the egg donor. \nThe Nadiya clinic in Kiev used the technique to treat an infertile couple, not a couple carrying a mitochondrial disease. \nUK experts said this was \"highly experimental\". \nValery Zukin, who led the work, said they had a hunch it would work for the Ukrainian couple who had not been able to conceive with conventional IVF. \nHe said he had a second patient - in a similar situation - who is expected to give birth in early March. \nThe UK has already passed laws to allow three-person IVF for couples with mitochondrial diseases, although no such baby has been born in Britain yet. \nThe science is new and controversial and raises ethical questions, including how any child from the technique might feel about having DNA from three people. \nProf Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: \"Pronuclear transfer is highly experimental and has not been properly evaluated or scientifically proven. \n\"We would be extremely cautious about adopting this approach to improve IVF outcomes.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T05:39:03.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
