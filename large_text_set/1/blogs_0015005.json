Tutto Mercato Web exclusively reports that Antonio Conte and Diego Costa have made peace. They don’t go into too much detail about this but confirm that he’ll be back in the team this weekend. \nChelsea host Hull City at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Costa checks his cards \nThe Blues got on just fine without their star striker when they travelled to Leicester on Saturday. Marcos Alonso stepped up to the plate in the Spain international’s absence. He bagged a brace and came close to getting a hat-trick – not bad for a wing-back. Pedro got the other goal in a very comfortable 3-0 stroll. \nPerhaps it made Costa review his hand. \nAntonio Conte refused to relent to player power by approaching Costa first. The argument was started by the forward and if it was to have a happy ending, it would be up to Costa too. Now Chelsea can concentrate on their title bid again.
