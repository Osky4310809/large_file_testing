We have triggered a major extinction event. The question is: How do we stop it?” Biologist Paul Ehrlich, of Stanford University in California, told the paper.\nThe report, commissioned for the a Biological Extinction conference, notes that poaching has also prompted a plunge in animal populations.\nThere are, for example, only 5,000 black rhinos left in the wild. Hunters kill and bag them because their horns worth more than $120,000 per pound and are used in Chinese medicine.\nLeading biologists will meet at a Vatican conference this week to brainstorm how to prevent extinction.\n“The living fabric of the world is slipping through our fingers without our showing much sign of caring,” the report notes.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:00:54.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
