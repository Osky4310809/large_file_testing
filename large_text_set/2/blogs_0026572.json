Beth Latimer (Jodie Whittaker) is woven into this new tale as she is working in a sexual advice clinic. Her now-ex-husband, Mark (Andrew Buchan) has published a book about his experiences and was too scared to go to his own launch, leaving the hot vicar, Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill) trying to persuade him. \nWe met some impressive newcomers, too. Sarah Parish has joined the cast as Cath Atwood, the hostess of the fateful party and Trish’s colleague at the farm shop, along with her husband, Jim, (played by Mark Bazeley), who apparently uses the same condom brand as the attacker. Sir Lenny Henry plays moody farm shop boss Ed Burnett and Miller has assertive new recruit DC Katie Harford to contend with (Georgina Campbell, known for Bafta-winning Murdered By My Boyfriend ). Sir Lenny Henry plays farm shop boss Ed Burnett \nAway from the thin blue line, we saw the start of the web of storylines to come. DS Miller was losing patience with her bereaved dad and son Tom, now a moody teenager, was caught sharing porn at school “I will not let you be your father’s son,” Miller snapped. DI Hardy’s daughter is also growing up, giving him further motivation to catch the attacker. There are still some light moments, not least DI Hardy and DS Miller’s relationship that veers from sibling-like to a deep mutual respect. “Don’t be a t*** about it,” said Miller when Hardy ribbed her for turning up at his door at 2am with the latest case news, not acknowledging that he himself was also up in the small hours. \nSo it was a lot to take in, but at a pace that reminded us how good this show can be, heightened by Olafur Arnalds’s haunting score. I suspect some viewers might find it a bit oppressive, but I think it ramps up the suspense. DS Miller and DI Hardy have 50 blokes to eliminate from the party suspect list, oh yes, and there was no security at the venue so really they have the whole of Wessex to comb and question. Apparently the cast didn’t know until far down the line who the culprit was and scripts were encrypted, so expect lots of twists and turns and red herrings. And don't say I didn't warn you about the next bout of the fever.
