(Photo: Esquire/Metal) More The idea of women shaving their faces is far from the norm in society, but some publications work to show that gender constrictions are becoming increasingly blurred in today’s day and age. Model Linsey Wixson recently posed — while shaving her face — for the spring/summer 2017 cover of Barcelona-based magazine Metal . The striking cover of the biannual publication was shot by 21-year-old New York City-based photographer Gabriela Celeste . Wixson posted the image on her instagram account, detailing the credits for the cover and adding the hashtags, “ #remakethepast #rethinkthepresent #metal37 #metalmagazine. “ The image is one of eight covers of the issue centered on the concept “Remake the Past, Rethink the Present.” “Remaking, revisiting, reinterpreting: we all do it to some extent. Some call it inspiration, some others call it insolence. That awkward space between respect and temerity is where this issue emerged,” the magazine’s editor in chief, Yolanda Muelas, and creative director Carlos Ramírez wrote in the editor’s letter. This shot in particular — featuring the unconventional beauty regimen — is actually a recreation of Esquire’s March 1965 cover, which was designed by George Lois and featured Italian actress Virna Lisi. Esquire’s March 1965 cover featured Italian actress Virna Lisi shaving her face. (Photo: Esquire) More At the time of the 1965 cover, the artistic concept was not wholeheartedly embraced by all parties involved. “The ad guys hated it. It was too edgy, ” Lois told Esquire . “They were worried about losing clients.” Despite the pushback, Lois was keen on presenting his vision to the world through the concept. “I wanted to capture a woman being manly and still beautiful. It was a spoof of the whole idea of a glamorous Hollywood,” he said. Although the beauty regimen might seem uncommon for women in today’s society, it’s actually embraced by many — and it has some beneficial effects. “Many people feel that men age better than women because they shave their faces,” dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, MD , director of cosmetic and clinical research in the Department of Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, tells Yahoo Beauty . “The regular skin exfoliation that occurs along with hair removal improves skin radiance.” The dermatologist also shared that shaving properly is the key to avoiding irritation. “Be sure to prep the skin with shaving gel, just as you would when shaving your legs,” he says. “After shaving, apply postshave moisturizer to improve skin hydration and minimize the risk of skin irritation.” On the belief that hair will grow back thicker after shaving one’s face, Zeichner offered a different take. “That’s actually a myth. The hair that grows back does so with a blunt edge, but the diameter of the hair is no thicker than it would be before it was shaved,” he said. Dermaplaning — the process of using a special scalpel to remove dead skin and hair on the face — is also also becoming more popular with women.
