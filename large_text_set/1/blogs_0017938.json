This past December, Gabbard introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act, the terms of which her website outlines succinctly: “The legislation would prohibit the U.S. government from using American taxpayer dollars to provide funding, weapons, training, and intelligence support to groups like the Levant Front, Fursan al Ha and other allies of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, al-Qaeda and ISIS, or to countries who are providing direct or indirect support to those same groups.” And Gabbard herself was quoted as saying that the “CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. This support has allowed al-Qaeda and their fellow terrorist organizations to establish strongholds throughout Syria, including in Aleppo.” Gabbard, who is co-sponsoring the bill with Rep. Thomas Massie, also tweeted : “ If you or I gave money, weapons or support to al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail.” Though critics are quick to call such concerns mere conjectures, it seems the facts are there. Anonymous reports : advertisement - learn more \nThey can be verified by none other than suspected war criminal Tony Blair . A think tank founded by the former U.K. Prime Minister released a report in 2015 that concluded it was ultimately pointless to make a distinction between the various rebel groups on the ground since the majority of these groups share ISIS’s core belief system (and would impose Sharia law if they came into power). Gabbard concluded: The CIA has long been supporting a group called Fursan al Haqq, providing them with salaries, weapons and support, including surface to air missiles. This group is cooperating with and fighting alongside an al-Qaeda affiliated group trying to overthrow the Syrian government. The Levant Front is another so-called moderate umbrella group of Syrian opposition fighters. Over the past year, the United States has been working with Turkey to give this group intelligence support and other forms of military assistance. This group has joined forces with al-Qaeda’s offshoot group in Syria. This madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its’ citizens. That is why I’ve introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists bill—legislation based on congressional action during the Iran-Contra affair to stop the CIA’s illegal arming of rebels in Nicaragua. Adding more insult to injury, Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration are said to be entirely aware of the support the Gulf states have provided to ISIS. The bill passing would ensure the federal agency was no longer able to support a terrorist group, and it would prohibit it from funnelling support through other countries directly or indirectly supporting terror groups as well. Below is a great video of award winning journalist Ben Swann shares a number of facts regarding the origin and creation of ISIS.
