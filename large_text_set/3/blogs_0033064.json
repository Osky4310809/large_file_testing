Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe mother knifed to death alongside her 13-year-old son at their home in Stourbridge had 'taken in a homeless man and had given him work', friends revealed today. \nDashcam footage meanwhile has emerged showing police chasing a man wanted in connection with the alleged double murder in the West Midlands town. \nMum-of-two Tracey Wilkinson, 50, and son Pierce both died from their stab wounds - while dad Peter is still fighting for his life in hospital - after all three were attacked at around 8am yesterday morning. \nA man in his 20s was arrested on suspicion of murder and wounding - and police today applied for more time to question him. \nPolice are yet to confirm whether the arrested man was living with the family - but have said they believe he was known to them. \nMore details are emerging today of the generous family's work in the local community to help those less fortunate than themselves. \nLocal Tory councillor Colin Elcock told today how the Wilkinsons had taken in a young man since Christmas and had proudly claimed he was making great progress. \nMr Elcock said: \"They took in a homeless person who was a local and Peter found him a job at his company. Tracey Wilkinson died despite paramedics' best efforts to save her (Photo: Facebook) Pierce, 13, with his father Peter - both of whom were stabbed (Photo: Internet Unknown) \n\"Tracey certainly looked after him with food and that kind of thing and Peter was very pleased to say they were helping him become a member of society again. \n\"We're hoping that Peter will of course pull through. \n\"At the last ward meeting back in February they said they were pleased with his progress and had him doing work for them.\" \n\"Whether it was something in an office or at an engineering workshop he was placed, I don't know but I do know Peter was a managing director of a foundry before taking over at Hill and Smith so maybe he got the man a job there. \n\"It was a good deed and something the family thought they were doing to help and make a difference in society. \n\"They were a lovely couple. Peter was a businessman, and used to travel a lot to the USA and Europe with his job, but both he and Tracey helped me deliver pamphlets for the Mayoral elections.\" Three people were found at the family home with serious stab wounds (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \nAn old colleague of Pete's also confirmed the family had had a lodger for the past few months. \nHe said: \"I knew they had someone staying with them since a few months ago but I don't know under what circumstances. \n\"They didn't really talk about him and just kept to themselves.\" The Land Rover speeds past in a nearby street to the family's home \nA Land Rover was intercepted by police around half an hour after emergency services received 999 calls about three people from the same family being stabbed. \nVideo footage taken from a dashcam on a car travelling down the same road shows a black Land Rover - which police said had been stolen from the family's home - being pursued by cops in a nearby street. \nIt shows cars not connected with the incident being overtaken by a Land Rover being driven at speed - with a police car in pursuit with its blue lights flashing. \nSeconds later the film footage cuts to a scene where the same vehicle can be seen severely smashed up after apparently ploughing into a garden wall - as police jump out of their parked up cars. A police car can be seen clearly in pursuit \nPolice later confirmed that two police officers - who were injured when their 'vehicle was rammed' before the Land Rover crashed - were later discharged from hospital after treatment. \nEmergency services have since described the \"horrific and heartbreaking\" scenes they faced while responding to 999 calls to the alleged double murder. \nThey came across three people suffering life-threatening injuries. Seconds later the Land Rover has been in a collision \nParamedics battled in vain to save 13-year-old Pierce Wilkinson alongside his mum Tracey - who were both stabbed at the family's West Midlands home at around 8am. \nTracey, 50, was pronounced dead at the scene - while her son, who suffered a cardiac arrest after being stabbed, was rushed to Birmingham Children's Hospital but died shortly after arrival.

They were a lovely family. \"I know there was someone living at the house with them. \"I don't know if it was a homeless person but I know they had taken someone in.\" Tribute left at the scene of the alleged murders (Photo: Birmingham Mail) Floral tributes laid outside a police forensics tent at the family's home (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \nPupils at the local Redhill School which Pierce attended are being offered counselling today. \nFriends and neighbours have been laying floral tributes at the family's home in Greyhound Lane, Norton, since news of the deaths broke. \nSome of the flowers being laid at the scene are from classmates who say he will never be forgotten. \nOne tribute read: “RIP Pierce, you will never be forgotten. We had so many good memories and I hope you're safe up there. Fly high bro. RIP Pierce and Tracey. Love Cooky/Jamie xxxx” Tribute left at the scene of the alleged murders (Photo: Birmingham Mail) Tribute left at the scene of the alleged murders (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \nAnother tribute read: “The most amazing family!

Lots of love Sophie, Carly and Elliot xxx” \nThe Midlands Air Ambulances from Cosford and Staffordshire raced to the scene along with two land ambulances, two MERIT trauma doctors, two senior paramedic officers, a paramedic area support officer and a community paramedic in a rapid response vehicle. \nDudley Police Superintendent Lee Kendrick described the scenes as \"truly horrific and heartbreaking\". \nHe said: \"Police and ambulance were confronted with an awful scene: a man, woman and boy all with very serious stab injuries. \n“The woman and boy were found in the house and the man in the garden. \n“Tragically there was nothing that could be done to save the woman – and her son later died in hospital from his injuries. \n\"Our hearts go out to the victims’ family and friends at this devastating news.\" Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the attack (Photo: Birmingham Mail) A forensics tent is set up in the garden (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \nA West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman added: “Ambulance staff arrived on scene to find three seriously injured patients; a woman, a man and a boy. \n“Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of ambulance staff it became apparent at the scene that nothing could be done to save the woman and she was confirmed deceased. \n“The teenage boy was found to be in cardiac arrest and received specialist trauma care and advanced life support from our staff. \n\"He was taken on blue lights to Birmingham Children’s Hospital with treatment continuing en-route. \n“Sadly, shortly after arrival in A&E and despite the best efforts of ambulance staff and hospital medics, he could not be saved and he was also confirmed dead. \n“The man, who was conscious, was also in a serious condition as a result of his stab wounds and was alerted in to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham by land ambulance.” A dog is removed from the home by police (Photo: PA) The vehicle appears to have crashed into a wall (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \nA post mortem is due to be carried out on the bodies of Pierce and Tracey on Saturday. \nHusband and father Peter, a company director, remains in critical but stable condition in hospital. \nThe couple have another daughter, Lydia, an 18-year-old student at Bristol University, who is understood to have not been at home during the attack and is being comforted by relatives today. Crime scene investigators prepare to enter the scene (Photo: PA) A forensics officer leaves the property (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \nWest Midlands Police said in a statement: \"A man has been arrested on suspicion of stabbing a woman and her teenage son to death – and seriously injuring her husband – during a knife attack at their Dudley home. \nAnyone with information is asked to call West Midlands Police on 101.
