Check out the trailer in the player below. \nRave in the Redwoods, the next thrilling chapter of the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare zombies experience, continues the macabre narrative while transporting players into a new decade: the 1990s. Willard Wyler, the enigmatic movie director villain, returns and has trapped the protagonists inside another one of his twisted horror films. The four playable characters from the original story also return, but with fresh, over-the-top roles, as they learn more about Wyler’s evil plot while fighting all-new varieties of the undead in an abandoned, lakeside summer camp where zombie ravers have taken over and turned the grounds into a techno-fueled illusion. Rave in the Redwoods is a tense, spooky thrill ride with shocking twists, surprises, and a slew of new Easter eggs for players to discover. \nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare Sabotage DLC Map Pack also includes four new maps and is available as part of the game’s Season Pass, which can be purchased on its own or obtained as part of the Legacy Pro or Digital Deluxe editions of the game.
