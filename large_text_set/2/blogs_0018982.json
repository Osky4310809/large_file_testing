We will not tear families apart,” de Blasio said last month as he pledged not to “allow our police officers to be used as immigration agents.” \nIn this case, a de Blasio spokeswoman said that despite allegations the illegal immigrant was a member of a gang, he had done nothing that under the city’s rules required him to be held.
