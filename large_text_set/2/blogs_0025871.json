As a result, users were only allowed to use it on one device, severely limiting its accessibility.\nStill in early development, but coming to a desktop near you… #GoogleAllo #SneakPeek pic.twitter.com/f7QNFH7IHO \n— Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) February 24, 2017 \n\nWhile Allo is a lot of fun to use (groups are especially great), the messaging app hasn’t exactly been a runaway success. Allo has dropped out of the top 500 apps chat on the Play Store, suggesting interest from consumers was very low.\nBy bringing Allo to the desktop, Google appears for open to the concept of taking the service multi-platform, and therefore making it much more accessible to users. Judging by the screenshot shared by Fox, all of Allo’s headlining features are in tow, including Google Assistant.\nGoogle should go all out Google’s approach to messaging is still confusing as hell, what with Allo, Hangouts, and the re-branded Android Messages all offering different features and functionality. Outside of the desktop, it’s unclear of Allo will journey to other platforms, something Hangouts offers.\nFox said Allo for the desktop is still in early development, so it will likely be many months before support officially launches. With Google’s I/O planned for May, however, chances are Google will divulge more information then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:00:28.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
