How to Install Yoast SEO Plugin \nFirst,   Yoast SEO   will notice a new menu item in WordPress admin bar labeled SEO with Yoast SEO logo on it. \nNow that you have installed and activated the plugin,   properly setup this powerful plugin. How to Setup WordPress SEO Plugin by Yoast \nYou should remember, that the settings that we select are the ones that we recommend. Other experts may have their own preferences and discretion, so advanced users can ignore anything that they do not like. \nIf you are a beginner, and you want to use Yoast’s WordPress SEO plugin like we do, then please follow along the steps carefully. Step 1. Data Transfer \nMost of you probably have another WordPress plugin like All in One SEO pack , or a theme framework like Genesis dealing with your SEO data. \nIf you want to successfully use this plugin, then you need to make sure that all of your previous data has been transported to this plugin before you deactivate the other one. \nTo accomplish this, we recommend using SEO Data Transporter by StudioPress . If you’re setting this up on a new blog, then skip this step. Step 2. General Settings \nClicking on the SEO icon takes you to settings page for the plugin. Click on ‘General’ tab and you will notice a button to open configuration wizard. We want you to ignore this wizard, because we will be taking you step by step through each option. Step 3. Features \nLet’s switch to the ‘Features’ tab and enable the advanced settings page. \n  save changes button to store your settings. \nYou will notice new items appear under the SEO option in your WordPress menu. \nThese items include Titles and Meta, XML Sitemaps, Social, Advanced, and tools. We will be showing you how to setup each one later in this article. Step 4. Your Info \nNext, you need to switch to the ‘Your Info’ tab. This is where you will provide information about your site and the person or company behind it. \nFirst you need to provide a site name and an alternate name for search engines to consider. Your site’s name could be your site’s title. \nIf you do not enter anything here, then Yoast SEO will automatically use your site’s title as your website name. Search engines like Google can display this information in search results like this: \nThe next option is to choose whether this website is run by a company or an individual person. If you choose company, then you will be asked to provide a company name, and you can also upload a company logo. \nOn the other hand, if you choose a person, then you can add the name of the person behind the website. Step 5. Webmaster Tools \nIf you know a little bit about SEO, then you have probably heard that each of the popular search engines, Google, Bing, Yandex, and Alexa allow site owners to add their sites using webmaster tools area (see our guide on how to add your WordPress site to Google webmaster tools ). \nWebmaster tools let you see insights and other relevant data about your site from specific search engines. \nIn order to verify your site and see those exclusive data, you have to add a meta tag to your site, or upload a file. Most beginners are afraid to add meta tags, so Yoast put this option in to ease the process. Simply add the meta code that you received from the search engines in the respective fields. Step 6. Security \nThe last tab in general settings is labeled Security. This has only one option which disables advanced part of the WordPress SEO meta box. We recommend that you leave it disabled. Disabling advanced metabox will prevent your authors from making advanced changes like and canonical settings (which is good). Step 7. Titles & Metas \nTitles & Metas section under Yoast SEO has several tabs in it. We will cover each one of them. \n1. General \nHere you can choose the symbol you want to use a separator between titles. Default option is dash, you can use it if you are unsure which symbol to choose. \nOn this page, you can also disable readability and keyword analysis tab which appear under the Yoast SEO metabox when you are writing post. We recommend that you leave them enabled. \n2. Homepage Title \nNext, we will work on defining the title for our homepage. By default you will see these fields pre-filled with title-template. So what is the difference between a title and a title template, you may ask. \nIn instances like your homepage, you may want to create a static title, description, and keywords. But for posts, the title will vary from one post to another. \nTitle templates allow you to define a way that the title and other meta information is pulled and organized. \nLet’s take a look at the image below for the home page settings. By default the template variables in the title field work fine for most website however you’re welcome to change it. The next option is to enter your site’s description. Once you are done, click on save settings button. \nNote: If you are using a static homepage , then you will see links to edit your homepage and blog page to add title and meta descriptions. \n3. Post Types Titles & Metas \nBy default WordPress comes with several post types such as post, page, revisions, attachment, and navigation menus . Users can also define their own custom post types . \nYoast SEO allows you to set titles and meta for posts, pages, media, and other custom post types. This site-wide title and meta description will be used if you forgot to add title and meta description for individual post. \nWe recommend leaving the description fields blank for all post types here. We also recommend using only the post title as the title template. \nRemember Yoast SEO plugin also adds an SEO meta box in your post edit area. For maximum SEO benefits, we highly recommend you to manually enter title and descriptions for each post, page, and custom post type on your site. Otherwise Yoast SEO will use the title as defined here and will automatically add description for your posts and pages. \nRead our WordPress SEO Tip for Beginners on optimizing blog posts. \n4. Taxonomies \nOn the taxonomies tab, you can configure titles and meta for categories, tags, custom taxonomies, and post format archives. \nDefault template variables should work for most sites. As for descriptions, please remember that Yoast SEO picks up descriptions from your categories and tags. \nIf you do not have any description for terms in your categories, tags, or custom taxonomies, then WordPress SEO does not add meta description in archives for these terms. Check out our guide on categories vs. tags . \n5. Archives \nOn the Archives tab, you have title and meta settings for author and date archive pages, and special pages such as search and 404 pages. \nWe recommended that you check disable author archives for single author blogs. If you are running a single author blog, then your main blog and the author archives contain exactly the same content. The setting is there to prevent duplicate content. \nLeave other settings as they are and save changes. \n6. Other \nThe other tab has some additional settings. Like you can disable picking up descriptions from Dmoz or Yahoo directories for your pages. If you are unsure what to do here, just leave all of them unchecked Step 8. Social \nAs we said earlier, Yoast SEO is a powerhouse packed with many features to provide comprehensive optimization. \nOne great feature of the plugin is that it integrates your site with Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ social platforms. \nClicking on the Social link under the SEO menu will take you to setup these platforms. We will show you how to configure each of them. \n1. Accounts \nThe first tab under the social settings is for all your social accounts. This allows Yoast SEO to tell Google about your social profiles. You need to simply add the URLs and Twitter username for the main social profiles of your site. \n2. Facebook \nOn the Facebook tab, first make sure that open graph meta data option is enabled. Checking this allows WordPress SEO to add Facebook open graph meta data in your website’s <head> section. \nThis will help Facebook pick up the right thumbnail and page information when a post from your website is shared on Facebook. \nThe next option is to provide a thumbnail for your homepage with SEO title and description. This image and description will be used when someone shares the homepage of your site on Facebook. \nAfter that you can provide a default thumbnail image URL. This image will be used for all articles that do not have a thumbnail or any other image in it. \nThe next option is to associate your website with a Facebook profile. This profile can be a user profile as well as a Facebook app. In most cases, Facebook profile is the way to go. \nYou can add a Facebook admin which will give you access to Facebook Insights for your site. \n3. Twitter \nAs for Twitter, you can add Twitter cards into your site’s head section. \nYou can also choose the card type to use. We recommend using summary with large image. \n4. Pinterest \nPinterest uses Open Graph meta data just like Facebook. Make sure that you have open graph meta data box checked under Facebook settings. \nAfter that you just need to enter the site verification code provided by Pinterest. Simply visit your Pinterest account settings to add and verify your site. You will be provided with a meta tag that you need to enter here. \n5. Google+ \nIf you have created a Google+ page for your business enter its URL here, and then go to your Google+ business page and enter your website’s URL in about section. Step 9. XML Sitemaps \nSitemaps are essential for your WordPress site. It is the quickest and easiest way to get indexed and notify search engines about your content. Sitemaps also allow you to tell search engines how to prioritize your content. \nWordPress SEO by Yoast makes it super easy to add XML sitemaps in WordPress . The XML Sitemaps settings is divided into different tabs. We will walk you through them. \nFirst you need to make sure that XML Sitemaps are enabled. \nAfter that you   ‘User Sitemap’ tab and make sure that author/user sitemap options is disabled. \nMove on to post type tab and disable any post type that you don’t want to be included into sitemaps. \nBy default, Yoast SEO disables Media Attachments from sitemaps. \nRepeat the same process for taxonomies. If there is a taxonomy that you don’t want to be included into sitemaps, then you can exclude it here. \nThe excluded posts tab allows you to remove individual posts,pages, or custom post types from XML sitemap. Simply enter the post IDs in the field and save changes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:58:06.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
