By: FE Online | California | Published: February 24, 2017 2:58 PM Jimmy Kimmel will be hosting the 89th Annual Academy Awards. \nThe 89th Annual Academy awards, commonly known as Oscars, is going to be held on February 26. The ceremony will be held California. Awards will awarded in 24 different categories in film by the cademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). The event will be on air across the globe. In India, people can watch it live on Monday morning in Star Movies and Star Movies Select HD at 5:30 am. \nActor Jimmy Kimmel will host the ceremony for the very first time. Among those who will distribute awards during the function include celebrities like Amy Adams, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans, Dwayne Johnson, Scarlett Johansson, Alicia Vikander, Brie Larson, Halle Berry, Jamie Dornan, Dakota Johnson, Felicity Jones, Kate McKinnon, Janelle Monáe, Emma Stone, Charlize Theron, among many others. \nThis year, Oscars expected to be very exciting as most of the nominations are more than brilliant. Damien Chazelle’s La La Land, starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, tops the list of nominees with 14 nominations including one for Best Picture. But the Best Picture award will probably get grabbed by Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight. The awards function will also feature performances by Auli’i Cravalho, Harold Wheeler, John Legend, Sting, Justin Timberlake and Lin-Manuel Miranda. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nThe 89th annual Academy awards nominations will be digitally streamed on Oscar.org or Oscar.com. And with two consecutive years of all-white nominees the Oscar will hopefully trend in a different directions this year. As Barry Jenkin’s ‘Moonlight, African American drama ‘Hidden Figures’ and Denzel Washington’s ‘Fences’ stand as strong contenders for the nominations, questions also stays on how many nomination this year’s favorite ‘La La Land’ clinches. It will be the first Oscars voted on since academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs ushered in new membership rules and added 683 new members as a way to diversify a predominantly white, male and elderly group, which now numbers 6,687.
