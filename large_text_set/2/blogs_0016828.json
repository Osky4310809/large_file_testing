He’s going to talk about a bunch of different things,” \n“The comments are absolutely indefensible, they’re appalling, and very disappointing that those came out,” he reiterated. “However, there is context. Some of the context is that Milo is a gay man, who was abused as a child. These are not irrelevant.” \nDespite his denunciations, Marlow accused anti-Trump conservatives and liberals of digging up the video as a “coordinated hit.” He also accused the media of hypocrisy, saying that Lena Dunham and Roman Polanski ‘s actions were much worse. \n“There are millions of examples of the left normalizing behavior similar to what Milo describes,” he insisted. \nListen above, via Brietbart.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:15:13.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
