Its been a minute since we last heard from Sam Lachow. In fact, the last time the multi-talented Seattle artist impacted our website was back in April of last year when he released the mixtape Friends, Funk & Liquor , but thankfully that drought ends here today. With an upcoming tour kicking off later this weekend (tix here), Sam decides to treat fans to the 6th installment in his “80 Bars” series that kicked off way back in 2014 . \"I use the 80 bars projects as a way to let my fans know what's been on my mind, and also as an excuse to fuck around on some nostalgic beats. Thanks to you guys, I'll prolly keep making these forever.\" Going in over some classic instrumentals, Sam leaves the hook at home & drops them witty bars for nearly 4-minutes straight.
