Vintage. pic.twitter.com/CV68bl0J3X — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 5, 2017 \nUnited interestingly opted to match Leicester's 4-4-2 from the start, with Marcus Rashford pushed up alongside Ibrahimovic, and both sides cancelled each other out in a scrappy and uneventful opening 20 minutes. \nIt was Rashford who missed United's first presentable chance, side-footing over the crossbar after a brilliant run from Mkhitaryan and some good interplay with Mata. \nUnited's frustrations were beginning to show against an initially impressive Leicester rearguard, with Mata a little fortunate to escape with only a yellow card for his late lunge on Vardy, although Kasper Schmeichel made an excellent save low to his right from another close-range Rashford strike. \nBut just as the teams looked set to go into the break level, United struck in ruthless fashion. \nMkhitaryan netted first, prodding the ball past Robert Huth, racing into the penalty area and firing right-footed beyond Schmeichel despite the goalkeeper getting a touch. \nEighty-eight seconds later, Ibrahimovic doubled the lead, steering Antonio Valencia's low cross from the right back across Schmeichel and into the net after finding clear space 12 yards from goal. 88 - There were just 88 seconds between Mkhitaryan's and Ibrahimovic's goals for @ManUtd . Quickfire. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 5, 2017 \nRanieri brought on Andy King and Demarai Gray at the interval in a bid to inject some life into Leicester's fight, but United needed only another four minutes to quell that resistance. \nMata fed Mkhitaryan on the edge of the area and ran through to meet the Armenia captain's sublime reverse pass, before slotting beneath Schmeichel from six yards. \nRiyad Mahrez whipped a free-kick narrowly wide but Mata should have made it 4-0 when he contrived to lift the ball into Schmeichel's grateful grasp after springing the rusty Leicester offside trap. \nUnited knocked the ball around with ease in the closing stages, though Mkhitaryan skied a half-chance to make it 4-0, while Leicester now turn their attentions to a potentially crucial week in which they face an FA Cup replay against rivals Derby County and a league showdown with fellow relegation candidates Swansea City.
