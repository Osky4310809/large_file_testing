That’s a positive. But man, you’re trying to win the Daytona 500 here, you know. It’s just so disappointing.” \nDefending 500 winner Hamlin was part of a 17-car crash on Lap 128, while rookie Daniel Suarez got crunched in another wreck 14 laps later. Hamlin finished 17th, Suarez 29th. \n“Actually I was so ready to race because I had been taking care of my car a lot, a lot,” said Suarez. “I was asking my team, ‘Possibly, it’s time to race? It’s time to race?’ I guess it was still too early.” \nTruex, the lead driver for Furniture Row, also had some damage in the Lap 128 crash but his team fixed his No. 78 Toyota and with just two laps to go, Truex was leading the race, as it appeared he would earn redemption from being passed at the checkered flag by Hamlin last year. \nAlas, it was not to be. \nInstead, Truex was one of several drivers who ran out of gas at the end, and he fell to 13th place. \n“We did what we wanted to do and that was to put ourselves in position to have a shot at winning this race,” said Truex. “We came close but didn’t get it done in the end. But considering where we came from it was a good effort that should have had a better finish.” \nAfter winning Daytona and sweeping four of the top five spots in 2016, the highest-finishing Toyota in this year’s Daytona 500 was Michael Waltrip in eighth place. \nBut that’s racing for you. \nYou can have fast cars, great drivers and top pit crews and still see your day blow up. And that’s exactly what happened to the top Toyotas on Sunday at Daytona.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:19:38.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
