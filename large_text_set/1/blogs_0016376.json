'Time was running out': Honduran activist's last days marked by threats Read more \nThe Honduran indigenous leader, Berta Cáceres who received the Goldman prize in 2015, was murdered in March 2016 after years of death threats and intimidation linked to her campaign against an internationally financed hydroelectric dam. \nCaceres was among at least 122 activists murdered in Latin America last year while trying to protect natural resources from environmentally destructive mega projects such as dams, mines, tourist resorts and logging, according to research by the NGO Global Witness. In all, 2016 was the deadliest record on year for environmental activists with at least 185 killed. \n“The threats Isidro Baldenegro López faced for his resistance are emblematic of those suffered by countless others who take a stand against the theft of their land and destruction of the environment. Nowhere is it deadlier to do so than in Latin America,” said Global Witness campaigner Ben Leather. \n“The Mexican authorities must act with conviction, prosecuting those responsible for Isidro’s murder and protecting his family and colleagues. Failing to do so will only encourage future violence,” Leather added. \nThe western Sierra Madre mountain range in northern Mexico hosts one of the world’s most biodiverse ecosystems, which includes four colossal canyons each bigger than the Grand Canyon, and is the ancestral land of the Tarahumara people. \nThe forests have long been targeted by illegal loggers abetted by corrupt officials and landowners, forcing the Tarahumara into progressively smaller and more isolated areas. \nAs a young boy, Baldenegro witnessed the assassination of his father after he took a stand against logging. But despite the serious risks, Baldenegro dedicated his life to defending the forest and the lands inhabited by his community for hundreds of years. \nIn 1993 he founded a grassroots NGO to fight deforestation which attracted national attention. In 2002, he organised a series of blockades and marches which forced the government to temporarily suspend logging. The following year a protest led by the wives of murdered community leaders led to a court ruling banning logging. \nBut his efforts angered the powerful network of state officials, landowners and criminal bosses involved in logging, and in 2003 he was imprisoned for 15 months on false charges of arms and drugs possession. His illegal detention triggered widespread international condemnation from groups like Amnesty International, which eventually helped secure his release in 2004. \nHis death was reported by relatives to local media, who said the killers were responsible for a spate of murders and attacks against local indigenous people opposing logging. \nA spokesman from the state prosecutor’s office told the Guardian that one perpetrator had been identified but not yet detained. \nOn awarding him the Goldman prize in 2005, the organizers said: “Baldenegro’s courageous efforts have made him a national and international hero. He brought world attention to the beautiful, ecologically crucial old-growth forests of the Sierra Madre as well as the survival of the Tarahumara.” \nHe is one of only four Mexican activists to have been bestowed the award.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T20:08:22.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
