I think we just need to be a little bit more ruthless against him and see what transpires after that.\" \nExperienced all-rounder Shoaib Malik was also praising the young talent. \n\"I must appreciate and praise Shadab for the way he has been conducting himself, and taking wickets,\" Malik said. \n\"Obviously we all know, if you're playing against West Indies, you have to keep taking wickets. They are big guys, they hit boundaries and I think this is what we have been doing.\" \nThe third T20i between the two teams would be played on Saturday. 0 0 WI coach says batsmen 'gifted' wickets to Shadab   Latest Sport News, Pakistan Cricket, Psl 2017, Sport, Sport   \"WI coach says batsmen 'gifted' wickets to Shadab\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/136254-WI-coach-says-batsmen-gifted-wickets-to-Shadab+GeoSport- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-01T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:17:42.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
