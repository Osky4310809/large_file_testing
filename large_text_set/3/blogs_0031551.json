To what extent BioWare can turn the game around remains to be seen.\nHere's the full statement that was posted to Twitter this evening:\n\"It's been a week since we officially launched Mass Effect: Andromeda worldwide, and we couldn't be more excited that our fans are finally experiencing everything we've worked so hard to create.\nWe've received quite a bit of feedback, some of it positive and some of it critical. That feedback is an important part of our ongoing support of the game, and we can't wait to share more of our immediate plans with you on Tuesday, April 4.\nIn the meantime, keep your feedback coming. Our team is listening, working around the clock to gather information and plan out solutions to improve and build on Mass Effect: Andromeda .\nThanks for your continued support and for joining us on this journey.\"\nI do hope we see improvements, even if they take a while. I'm only several hours in so far and as much as I want to like this game, I've had a hard time convincing myself to sit down with it again.\nBioWare [Twitter]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:34:07.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
