We were NOT ready for this. Not after more than three hours of broadcast. Not after our eyes had started to water, and our brain has literally stopped working. Just as we thought we couldn't handle another President Trump joke, or see one more glimpse of Casey Affleck's dirty mug-rug, the inevitable happened. In a shocking plot list (what some are calling a sensational finale to Black History Month), underdog Moonlight wins over critic favourite, La La Land . But, here's the problem! Warren Beatty who was tasked to announce The Best Picture award, pulled a major Steve Harvey and mistakenly gave it to La La Land . The cast had gathered on stage and speeches were being read, when Beatty informed the stunned audience that he read La La Land after seeing Emma Stone's name on the winner's card. (Stone had just won Best Actress award). \"I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land ,\" Beatty explained. \"That's why I looked at Faye [Dunaway, who was co-presenting with Beatty], and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny.\" Yikes! Watch the cringe-worthy video below! The moment Moonlight really won at the #Oscars https://t.co/lXHipwu3LR pic.twitter.com/L27UMm8iRV", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:25:05.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
