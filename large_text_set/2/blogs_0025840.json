As Hollywood‚Äôs glitterati gathered in LA‚Äôs Dolby Theatre for the annual gift-giving bonanza, it was an event that didn‚Äôt go off without a hitch.\nIn case you‚Äôre still hazy from the weekend and have yet to properly surface, you may have missed the news that somehow, the holy grail award of Best Picture was initially awarded to the wrong movie . Yes, in what has to be the most absurd and outrageous moment in Oscars ‚Äî or any awards show ‚Äî history, veteran Bonnie and Clyde actors Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway took to the podium and accidentally presented the little gold man to La La Land instead of Moonlight. \nNothing like a movie twist. How \"La La Land\" won, then lost, the Oscar for best picture to \"Moonlight\" https://t.co/As9ZR7G5Tb pic.twitter.com/P8OuBRiM8m \n‚Äî Los Angeles Times (@latimes) February 27, 2017 \n\nBy the time La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz took to the stage and revealed the real victor to a bewildered audience, the damage was already done. Not only did this suck for the La La Land cast whose dream had been cruelly ripped away from them, but it also detracted from what is a miracle achievement for a $1.6 million art house movie about the life of a young, gay African-American male. Sympathies must go to Beatty and Dunaway, too, because human beings are fallible and make mistakes every day ‚Äî albeit not in front of such a massive viewing audience.\nAs ever, social media was abuzz at the unfortunate gaffe, with Twitter typically merciless. To save you the hassle, we‚Äôve rounded up some of the best takes below.\nI don't know the name of the bald dude from La La Land but he handled that like a champ. #Moonlight #Oscars #BestPicture pic.twitter.com/AfjZut75il \n‚Äî Cooper J (@nomopain2318) February 27, 2017 \n\nhonestly that bald guy from la la land is the real mvp giving up his award so easily\n‚Äî üçí (@galaxiesedge) February 27, 2017 \n\ni don't know who is the bald head guy who walked up and handle the whole thing but holy shit he saved the whole thing so gracefully\n‚Äî syn„ÄÇ (@supescavill) February 27, 2017 \n\nThe bald guy who pulled the card and kept saying Moonlight won is the real one.
