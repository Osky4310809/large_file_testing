The new projections state that the trio is slated to move between 100-120k units in the first week of sales. Read the original story below. Last week, Migos finally released their highly-anticipated Culture album . The project dropped right as the group's popularity reached heights like never before. With a No. 1 song already in tow, the focus now turns to the whether or not the album can also reach the top of the charts. According to early projections from HDD , the album is slated to move between 70-80k units in the first week, with 28-33k coming from pure sales and the rest streaming.

This would put the album in contention to go No. 1 with country artist Brantley Gilbert projected to do similar numbers. However, seeing that Migos' last album, Yung Rich Nation , only sold 14k in its first week back in 2015, this sort of increase would make it a win for the group no matter what. Though, it would be amazing to see Migos get a No. 1 album. Official numbers won't be out until later this week so we'll have to wait and see. You can stream the album right here .
