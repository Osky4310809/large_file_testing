The girls recently released single Touch (Photo: YouTube) \nShe explained: \"I think with us, we love to just wear what we want to wear. When we feel comfortable on stage, we're not really interested in the negative comments that people are saying about them being provocative. \n\"I don't even think they're that provocative if I'm honest! Beyonce and Lady Gaga were all wearing leotards on-stage and if I'm honest, it's actually quite easy to move in so that's probably why we choose them, because we do so much dancing and choreography! \n\"We are all so body confident now and that has taken a lot of time to build and the fact that we are, I think that's an amazing thing and we want to encourage our fans and everyone to be exactly the same way - wear what you want and be comfortable in it and sod what everyone else thinks!\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T19:17:42.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
