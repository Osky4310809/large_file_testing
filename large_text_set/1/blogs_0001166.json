Almost as much as he loves God, gun rights, and the feeling of his enemies' blood dripping from his brow. For Chuck Norris with more funny and less \"fact\" in it, see Chuck Norris (disambiguation) . “In Soviet Russia, Chuck Norris makes facts up about you.” ~ Russian Reversal on Chuck Norris facts \nChuck Norris Facts are an internet phenomenon that arose in 2005. These amazing statements were leaked from personal accounts of those very close to Norris. Often disguised as \"satirical factoids\" and cleverly camouflaged with utterly ridiculous facts, [1] they stemmed from earlier, less successful attempts at compiling lists of facts about celebrities. Most prominent in these earlier failed catalogs were Vin Diesel facts, such as \"Vin Diesel is a terrible actor\" and \"Vin Diesel is afraid of heights, spiders, and opaque liquids\" . Contents edit Creation of a Chuck Norris fact \nHere's one picked at random (and I mean it was literally picked at random): Chuck Norris was Hercules in Ancient Greece, just using a diffent name to hide his identity from the Gods, who were so afraid of him. \nNotice how the author thought of Hercules, then embarked on his/her brave journey. The slip over the spelling of 'different' was but a minor hiccup and proved non-fatal. Where things turned ugly was when the author decided that Chuck had called himself Hercules to hide his identity from the Gods. This had the insinuation that Chuck was somehow a coward. Rather than admit to themselves that this baldy worked out 'fact' had hit a brick wall, our plucky word juggler merely explained that Chuck's motivation for hiding his real name from the Gods was that they were 'so afraid of him.' Genius, or a completely nonsense narrative contrivance? You decide. edit Example facts \nNote: If you read any of these, and laugh, beware (unless you are laughing with him).
