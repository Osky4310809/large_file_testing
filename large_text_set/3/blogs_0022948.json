US bans electronic devices on flights from eight Muslim countries \n“What appears to be new is this latest overreaction — it appears to be a Muslim ban by a thousand cuts.” \nThe former official, who wished to remain anonymous, said the US had been training airport security across the Middle East on searching for explosives for as long as two years. He added that the rule constituted “unnecessary overreach” and appeared to target a group rather than address specific security concerns. \nMr Trump's controversial travel ban, which bars people from six Muslim-majority nations entering the country, has run into stiff opposition since it was first announced in January. \nTwo federal judges have placed restraining orders on the second version of the directive, which has been branded a \" legal disaster \" by its critics.

Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates are all believed to be affected. \nThe reason for the ban was not immediately clear and US security services would not comment on the matter. \nA US government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because the matter related to security secrets, told the Associated Press that such a ban had been considered for several weeks. \nHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly called politicians over the weekend to brief them on aviation security issues he claimed had prompted the impending electronics ban, according a congressional aide who was briefed on the discussion. The aide was not authorised to speak publicly about the issue and also declined to be publicly identified. \nThe announcement came shortly before Wednesday’s meeting of the US-led coalition against Isis in Washington. Several senior Arab officials were expected to attend the State Department gathering. It was unclear whether their travel plans were related to any increased worry about security threats. \nBrian Jenkins, an aviation-security expert at global policy think tank Rand Corp, said the nature of the security measure suggested that it was driven by intelligence of a possible attack. He added that there could be concern about inadequate passenger screening or even conspiracies involving insiders — airport or airline employees — in some countries.

Spencer Platt/Getty \nAnother aviation-security expert, professor Jeffrey Price of Metropolitan State University of Denver, said there were disadvantages to having everyone put their electronics in checked baggage. \nThefts from baggage would increase, as when the UK tried a similar ban in 2006, he said, and some laptops have batteries that can catch fire — an event easier to detect in the cabin than in the cargo hold. \nMost major airports in the United States have a computer tomography or CT scanner for checked baggage, which creates a detailed picture of a bag's contents. \nThey can warn an operator of potentially dangerous material, and may provide better security than the X-ray machines used to screen passengers and their carry-on bags. \nAssociated Press contributed to this report More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T11:35:40.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
