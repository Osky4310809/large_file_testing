Whether you only enjoy the original films, have love for the prequels or enjoy everything in between, one thing we all can agree on is that John Williams’s composing brings life to this beloved film franchise. Even with lackluster entries into the series, Williams soundtracks are always top notch. These beautiful scores resonate with all of us when we watch this beloved saga unfold.\nLast year it was announced that composer Michael Giacchino would take over composing duties on the first full-fledged Star Wars side story, Rogue One . Whether you enjoyed the film or not, you have to give credit to Giacchino for doing Williams justice by creating a dynamic and enthralling score that fit Rogue One ‘s dark tones perfectly.\nAlthough, if you are a John Williams junkie, rest assure that the legend himself is back in the studio and currently scoring this year’s highly anticipated entry into the Star Wars franchise, The Last Jedi.\nFilmmaker Robert Meyer Burnett recently stated on his Twitter feed last week…\nThis is pretty impressive, seeing as most studios will use a mock score in place to help enhance the editing process, thus giving a more clear vision for the final composer to come in and work their magic. In Jedi’s case, it will be quite the opposite. The already done John Williams score will be in place to help the editing process.\nI think it is safe to say we may be seeing a few dynamic moments with a robust and sweeping score. Just thinking about the editing team sitting down and tying these (hopefully) memorable scenes together, done by the familiar sounds of John Williams leaves me feeling confident that this entry may be one of its strongest in the series.\nWe may just get our first listen of the score during the teaser trailer of The Last Jedi, which is rumored to be attached to Disney’s live action adaptation of Beauty & the Beast , releasing in theaters March 17th, 2017. If not then, definitely the following month in Orlando, FL for Star Wars Celebration.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BurnettRM/status/830816741726969856"], "published": "2017-02-21T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:45:56.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
