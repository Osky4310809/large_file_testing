Viola Davis won her first Oscar (Photo: AFP) \n\"People ask me all the time 'What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola? And I say exhume those bodies, exhume those stories, of people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition, people who fell in love and lost. \n\"I became an artist and thank god I did because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life.\" The actress was in tears as she gave an emotional speech (Photo: AFP) \nPaying tribute to her co-star and director Denzel Washington, she said: \"Oh captain, my captain, Denzel Washington, thank you for putting two entities in the driving seat, August Wilson and God and they served me well.\" \nDavis had swept awards season in the role, taking home a Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild statuette and numerous critics prizes. Denzel Washington plays Troy Maxson and Viola Davis plays Rose Maxson in Fences Davis thanked co-star Washington in her speech \nIn \"Fences,\" the screen version of the prize-winning August Wilson play, Davis played Rose Maxson, a self-effacing wife whose modest life implodes when her charismatic husband insists on keeping a mistress. \nOn stage, Davis heralded Wilson, whom she said \"exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.\" The actress reduced the Oscars audience to tears (Photo: REUTERS) \nDavis won a Tony Award in the same role on stage in 2010. \nA forceful and popular actress, Davis is known for playing strong women and for speaking out for better roles for women and people of colour. \nOn television, she became the first black woman to win a lead actress Emmy award when she took home the statuette in 2015 for playing a conflicted criminal attorney in drama \"How To Get Away With Murder.\" The actress proudly posed with her Oscar statuette (Photo: Rex Features) \nRaised in an impoverished household in South Carolina and Rhode Island, Davis began acting as a teen at school and later trained at the Juilliard School in New York. \nShe began work in the theater, winning early acclaim. After years of doing small parts in movies, she made her breakout with just one scene in the 2008 religious film \"Doubt,\" earning her first Oscar nomination. \nThree years later she was nominated for best actress for \"The Help,\" but lost out to Meryl Streep.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:04:22.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
