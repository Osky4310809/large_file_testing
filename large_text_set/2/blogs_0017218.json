Chris Brown hopped on Instagram Tuesday afternoon to announce that his fight with Soulja Boy isn't going to happen. \n\"It was a legit thing on a positive scale,\" he said. \"All the wrong people got in the way. The middlemen people got in the way. The homies so to speak [...] got in the way because they wanted a piece of the pie.\" \nC-Breezy added that the fight was \"immature\" anyway. Meanwhile, Soulja Boy is livid and still sending IG threats to Brown. But the latter said he won't be forced into something he doesn't want to do. The \"Party\" singer took the opportunity to plug his upcoming \"Party\" tour with 50 Cent , French Montana , Kap G, OT Genasis and Fabolous . \nHe warned his followers not to listen to what's being spewed out there. He didn't refer to Karrueche Tran by name but there's no doubt that the restraining order must weigh on his mind right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:33:18.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
