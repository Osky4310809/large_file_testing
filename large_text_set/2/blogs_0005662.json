The Portuguese cleaner, who is in her 30s, arrived at Tara's west London flat at around 1.30pm on Wednesday and was heard crying by builders renovating the apartment below. The 45-year-old former model had been heard hoovering and walking around her flat the previous Wednesday and had previously complained several times about the builders to the flat's owner. Five builders renovating the property since September say they saw the cleaner visit the flat twice a week.

A footmat with a cartoon image of her carrying designer bags is at the entrance to her flat. One of the builders, who last saw her on Saturday January 14th, said: \"We could hear her walking around upstairs last week. \"She was cleaning. We could hear hoovering on Wednesday. \"It was the cleaner who found her. She was crying and it was very quiet before she arrived and set off the alarm.\" Ambulance crew leave Tara's flat yesterday afternoon (Photo: Ian Vogler/DAILY MIRROR) \nHe added: \"We didn't hear Tara often and the last time we saw her was on Saturday January 14th when there was a leak coming from her flat. \"We didn't ever see anyone going in or out. \"Maybe the cleaner was panicking and set off the alarm. \"She had complained about the noise from here. She was talking to the owner about it.\" Another builder, who didn't want to be named, said: \"I saw her on the stairs on Saturday and she looked tired.\" Builders said Tara had been complaining about the noise they were making while renovating the flat below hers (Photo: Rex Features) \nMinutes after the cleaner set off the alarm an ambulance arrived with several paramedics, followed by three police cars. Undertakers took Tara's body away on Wednesday evening. The builders said they had not been spoken to by police.
