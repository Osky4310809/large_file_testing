Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nKate McCann has threatened legal action against Facebook users who steal and share extracts from 'Madeleine,' the best-selling book she penned about her missing daughter. \nA 'Webmaster,' on behalf of the mum, has warned that sharing the content could result in violating copyright law. \nThe post says that people engaging in \"this illegal activity\" could face prosecution and may result in being struck off Facebook. \nShe has also hit out at claims she is cashing in on her daughter’s disappearance, saying: “For those posting that we are trying to make money, you are absolutely wrong.” \nIn a rare online reaction Maddie’s mum has vented her anger on a Facebook page promoting the hunt for her daughter. \nThe Official Find Madeleine Campaign is endorsed by ex GP Kate and heart doctor husband Gerry of Rothley, Leicestershire. \nAll posts by the site’s un-named web chief, a mum who runs the site with a group of fellow supporters, are approved by the couple. A post on the Official Find Madeleine Campaign threatens legal action against Facebook users stealing Maddie book extracts \nOn Kate’s behalf, she wrote today: “I would like to remind those who are sharing Kate's book online, you are violating copyright law. \n“Kate's publisher has notified Facebook and other social media networks of the links and people engaging in this illegal activity. \n\"You risk having your Facebook account terminated and could face prosecution brought by the publisher. Downloading and sharing copyrighted material is illegal.” \nThe Webmaster urges campaigners: “If you see Kate's book posted online out of the normal ways to purchase an e-book, please let us know. \n“We will notify Kate's publisher and they will have the links removed and determine if the person posting should be prosecuted.” \nKate, 49, and Gerry, 48, are bracing themselves for the painful milestone 10th anniversary of their daughter’s disappearance in less than seven weeks. \nThree-year-old Maddie vanished from a holiday apartment in Portugal’s Praia da Luz in May 2007 while her parents were dining in a nearby tapas bar with pals. \nThey are clinging onto a glimmer of hope that Maddie, who would now be aged 13, nearly 14, would still be alive. \nThe McCann’s have recently been subjected to a cruel torrent of online abuse from minor celebrities and so-called criminal experts. They spouted off after it was revealed Scotland Yard had been handed an extra £85,000 of taxpayers’ money to continue the Maddie hunt. \nSo far the inquiry codenamed Operation Grange and set up in May 2011 has failed to unearth any new clues.

By posting the book online, you are stealing from the publisher. \n“Kate was given an advance for her book which was put into the fund. This isn't about us making money. \n\"It's about participating in an illegal activity and stealing from the publisher, which is punishable under the law. If you don't want to purchase the book, that's fine. Just don't steal it!” \nIn May 2011 Kate penned her memoirs “to give an account of the truth” and to help boost the dwindling public fund set up to find her daughter. The £20 book simply called “Madeleine” and published by Transworld, part of Bantam Press, was a huge success.

Writing this memoir has entailed recording some very personal, intimate and emotional aspects of our lives. Sharing these with strangers does not come easily to me.” \nThe website states: Here's where you can legally purchase Kate's book. http://findmadeleine.com/campaigns/madeleine_book.html Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T19:25:19.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
