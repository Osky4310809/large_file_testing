Shattenkirk will be traded to the Washington Capitals, per multiple league sources. #stlblues \n— Jeremy Rutherford (@jprutherford) February 28, 2017 \nHere’s what the Blues will receive. As @Real_ESPNLeBrun reported, it's 2017 1st rder, cond'l 2018 2nd rder, Zach Sanford to STL for Kevin Shattenkirk. STL retains some salary. \n— Bob McKenzie (@TSNBobMcKenzie) February 28, 2017 \nShattenkirk arguably was the top player available before Wednesday’s 3 p.m. trade deadline. He has tallied 42 points (11 goals, 31 assists) in 61 games this season. \nHe will be an unrestricted free agent if unsigned by July 1 and could command $6.5 million or more per season in his next contract. The Capitals have several important players who will be UFAs or RFAs after the season, so this might be their best chance to win a championship for a while. \nThe Blues had no choice but to trade Shattenkirk. It didn’t appear he wanted to re-sign long-term with the club, and this way St. Louis acquires some assets in return for him instead of letting him walk for nothing as a free agent. \nThumbnail photo via Brad Rempel/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a Bruins/NHL question for Nick Goss?
