Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said that in good conscience, he cannot meet with Obama. \n\"In good conscience, I can't do it,\" Manchin said Wednesday on MNSBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \n\"If anyone listened and paid attention to what the American people said when they voted, they want this place to work. Can you imagine in here ... we have the outgoing president coming up here today to talk to only Democrats. We have the incoming vice president coming up to talk only to Republicans.\" \n\"And that's really what's wrong with the place,\" he said. \"I just think it's absolutely wrong.\" \nManchin continued to criticize Washington, D.C. and politicians on the Hill. \n\"I've been here for six years. We haven't fixed very many things and anyone who has trust or belief that we will fix it, they're living in fantasy land.\" . @Sen_JoeManchin says he won't attend Pres.
