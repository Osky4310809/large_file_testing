During an interview on the Sam Roberts Wrestling Podcast (h/t Dan Gartland of SI.com), the Heartbreak Kid mentioned that WWE had put the dream match on the table: \"I guess I'm breaking something with you and I don't even know if I should, but I could have had that match. They didn't have an opponent for AJ at WrestleMania. I said that I hadn't been asked because I hadn'tâ€”but then I was. ... I said, 'I wish that young man was here 10 years ago, man. I honestly do. I think he's very talented.'\" HBK retired following his WrestleMania 26 match against The Undertaker and hasn't competed since. With Michaels remaining steadfast in his desire to stay retired, Styles has instead been placed in a WrestleMania bout against SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon. The Phenomenal One earned the opportunity to face Bray Wyatt for the WWE Championship at the Showcase of Immortals after Randy Orton surrendered his No. 1 contendership, but The Viper later decided he wanted it back. That resulted in a No. 1 contender match between Styles and Orton in which Styles came out on the losing end. Styles blamed McMahon for the situation and jumped him in the parking lot, and that set the stage for their upcoming encounter. While Styles vs. McMahon promises to create some memorable moments, a match against Michaels could have potentially gone down as an all-time great.
