Thank you and goodbye' Tusk's emotional farewell to UK after Brexit DONALD TUSK this afternoon gave an emotional farewell to Britain after Theresa May formally triggered Article 50, telling the UK: \"We already miss you. Thank you and goodbye.\" PUBLISHED: 12:35,  11, Wed, Mar 29, 2017 Twitter/Donald Tusk Donald Tusk tweeted this picture of him formally receiving   \nAt a highly charged press conference in Brussels the EU Council chief looked devastated as he said Britain's formal notification of its   was a \"sad day\". \nBritain's ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, formally handed in the Government's intention to begin divorce proceedings in an historic meeting with the EU Council president this morning \nMr Tusk tweeted a photogaph of the history defining moment the missive, hand signed by Theresa May, was served saying Britain had finally \"delivered\" on Brexit. \nAddressing reporters in Brussels this afternoon he said: \"There is no reason to pretend that this is a happy day, neither in Brussels nor in London. After all most Europeans includning almost half the British voters wish that we would stay together not drift apart. \n\"I will not pretend that I am happy today but paradoxically there is also something positive in Brexit. REUTERS Tusk was given the letter by Sir Tim Barrow today \n\"Brexit has made us the community of 27 more determined and more united than before. I am fully confident of this especially after the Rome declaration and today I can say that we will remain determined and united also in the future also during the difficult negotiations ahead. \n\"This means that both I and the Commission have a strong mandate to protect the interests of the 27. There is nothing to win in this process and Iâ€™m talking about both sides. \n\"In essence this is about damage control. Our goal is clear - to minimise the cost for the EU citizens businesses and member states. We will do everything in our power and we have all the tools to achieve this goal and what we should stress today is that as for now nothing has changed.\" \n\"Until the UK leaves the EU EU law will continue to apply to and within the UK. \n\"We will act as one and start negotiations by focussing on all key arrangements for an orderly withdrawal. On Friday I will share a proposal of the negotiating guidelines with the member states to be adopted by   on the 29th of April. \nIn apparently unscripted remarks, the visibly emotional eurocrat then told reporters: \"What can I add to this? We already miss you. Thank you and goodbye.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:18:13.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
