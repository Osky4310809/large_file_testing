Thanks to designer Benjamin Geskin , we know exactly what that would look like. Too bad it won’t exist.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com The black on red juxtaposition makes the iPhone pop. The home button melts into the abyss of the black display for a very stealthy look. It also matches the black camera lens on the back. This feels like the combination Apple should have gone with, but for some reason didn’t.\nHow do you achieve this look? So how can you get this version of the iPhone? Well, you can’t get it from Apple.\nThe easiest way is just to slap a red skin on a black iPhone 7. It won’t look nearly as sleek or stealthy, but it’s a sacrifice you’ll need to make. The second way is the most expensive option: buy a PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 7 and replace the white display with a black version. There’s a big second-hand market for displays, so it’s not too difficult to locate one. Replacing the display would be another issue altogether, but if you’ve seen any iFixit videos before, it’s definitely possible.\nThe finished product just might be worth all the hassle.\niPhone 7 (RED) with black front. #iPhoneRED #iPhone7RED pic.twitter.com/wferyEcBwl \n— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) March 21, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:32:15.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
