Proceeds from RED would be in addition to the $130 million Apple has donated since the partnership began in 2007. \nAccording to Cook: “Since we began working with RED 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products. The introduction of this special edition iPhone is our biggest RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with RED, and we can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands.” \nApple is the world’s largest corporate donor to the Global Fund, contributing more than $130 million of the over $465 million generated by the organisation since inception.
