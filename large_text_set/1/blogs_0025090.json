An anonymous reader quotes a report from Electrek: Tesla CEO Elon Musk was already on President Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum , but the White House announced today that he will also be joining the administration's new manufacturing council , a private sector group that advises the U.S. secretary of commerce. He headed a meeting on Monday at the White House . Musk was present along with several other industry leaders who are now also formally joining the manufacturing council. CNBC reports : \"The group of business leaders includes Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk and chief executives of large American companies like Ford, Dow Chemical, General Electric, Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Richard Trumka, president of the labor federation AFL-CIO, will also give advice.\" As we recently reported, while Musk's mission to accelerate the advent of renewable energy might seem at odd with Trump's plan to unlock fossil fuel reserve, but Musk is betting that job creation is more important to the new President than simply satisfying the oil industry. If Trump wants to be the champion of job creation and Tesla shows that renewables create a lot of jobs, then their interests are aligned. Tesla currently employs over 30,000 people, more than 25,000 of which are in the U.S. The company wants to add over 3,000 manufacturing jobs at its factory in Fremont, California, 1,000 at its solar panel factory in Buffalo, New York, and over to 6,500 at the Gigafactory in Nevada .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T03:38:46.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
