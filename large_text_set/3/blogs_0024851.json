Bell missed all of the 2016 season after dislocating his ankle on the first day of organized team activities. \nDallas had a ready-made option to replace Leary, turning to La’El Collins after Leary signed with the Broncos. \nBell now becomes an option to replace the retired Free at right tackle. The ex-Titan offers versatility between the guard and tackle positions. He has started 72 of 78 career games, including all 16 during his lone healthy season with the Titans in 2015.
