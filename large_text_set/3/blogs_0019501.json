Like the outgoing 2016 model, the 2017 CR-V earned a Good score on all crash tests including the difficult small overlap test. \nOn all but the base LX trim, the 2017 CR-V comes standard with a host of active safety and driver assistance features including forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, road departure mitigation, and lane keeping assist. In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2017 CR-V earned the highest score of Superior since it was able to avoid 12- and 25-mph collisions. \nAs for the new test that evaluates the effectiveness of a vehicle’s headlights, the 2017 CR-V with the optional LED headlights received an Acceptable rating. However, models with the standard halogen headlights only received a Marginal rating. In addition to receiving an Advanced or Superior rating in the front crash prevention test, a car must receive an Acceptable or Good score in the headlight effectiveness evaluation in order to qualify for the Top Safety Pick+ rating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:38:30.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
