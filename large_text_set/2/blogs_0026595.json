He will pay a further £20m towards the costs of implementing the new scheme. \nSir Philip said in a statement: \"I have today made a voluntary contribution of up to £363m to enable the trustees of the BHS Pension schemes to achieve a significantly better outcome than the schemes entering the Pension Protection Fund, which was the goal from the outset. \nHe added: \"Once again I would like to apologise to the BHS pensioners for this last year of uncertainty, which was clearly never the intention when the business was sold in March 2015. \n\"I am also happy to confirm that any of the pensioners that have faced cuts over the last year will now be brought back to their original BHS starting level pension and will all be made whole. \n\"I hope that this solution puts their minds at rest and closes this sorry chapter for them.” \nChris Martin, chair of the BHS Pension Trustees, said: “The injection of cash from Sir Philip puts the new scheme on a stable footing. The Trustees have carefully considered all aspects of the deal and we are confident that this is a robust scheme that delivers improved and sustainable benefits. \n\"We are now focused on communicating with members to initially outline the options that will be made available so that they are aware of the next steps and are able to make informed decisions at the appropriate time. \n“I want to thank Sir Philip, the Pensions Regulator and PPF for their efforts over the last year and am pleased that this agreement delivers for all members.” \nBHS went into administration in April last year, putting 11,000 people out of work, and throwing its pension fund into jeopardy, after it recorded a deficit of £571m. \nSir Philip owned the chain, which had 164 shops, between 2000 and 2015, but sold it for just £1 after failing to arrest falling sales and profits. \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:04:55.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
