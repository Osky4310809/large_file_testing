Like so many celebrity social media accounts, Gomez has an assistant who now runs her Insta account and carefully crafts a public image to present to fans. \n“As soon as I became the most followed person on Instagram, I sort of freaked out,” Gomez told Vogue . \nThe 24-year-old celebrity says Instagram was so addictive that it consumed her to the point where she checked it after she woke up and before she went to bed. \n“…I was seeing things I didn’t want to see, like it was putting things in my head that I didn’t want to care about. I always end up feeling like shit when I look at Instagram.” \nIt’s okay Selena. Just breathe. It’s perfectly normal and OK to be be sick of Instagram and take a break from it. It’s also perfectly normal to feel like sh*t when you look at it. We normals feel like sh*t all the time whenever we fire up the app and see everyone’s stupid food pics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T05:30:40.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
