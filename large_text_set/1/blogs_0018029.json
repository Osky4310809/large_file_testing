MAARTEN HOLL/ FAIRFAX NZ \nLabour leader Andrew Little says Paul Eagle has \"everything you would need for a good, effective MP\". \n\"It's a huge honour to be asked to put my name forward, and I have the full support of my family – and Wellington Mayor Justin Lester,\" he said. \nREAD MORE: \n\"My main focus is serving the party and people of the electorate in the best way I can, which I believe is in Parliament.\" CAMERON BURNELL/ FAIRFAX NZ \nEagle with Rongotai MP Annette King in 2014. She is vacating the seat, to stand only on Labour's list at this year's general election. \nHe would now seek the Labour Party's nomination. \n“I am deeply connected and engaged in local issues which include housing affordability, transport and health and education as key priorities,\" said Eagle, who lives in Island Bay. \nWhen Eagle announced in December that he was considering running, one of the potential hurdles was the thought that Labour Leader Andrew Little, who also lives in Island Bay, might wish to run. \nBut Little has since said he will run only on the party list. \nLittle said Eagle had won council elections, organised well, and was a very strong identity with good connections in the area. \n\"He has got everything you would need for a good, effective MP.\" \nEagle, 44, was appointed Wellington's deputy mayor when Justin Lester won the capital's mayoralty in October. \nIn announcing he was putting his name forward, Eagle paid tribute to King. \n\"It’s important to recognise the tremendous and significant contribution that Annette has made to politics over the past four and a half decades, particularly in her electorate,\" he said. \n\"It’s been an honour to work closely with Annette for the past six years and to learn what it means to be a successful electorate MP.” - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T05:52:16.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
