Trump. Because we realize it’s better for us to get along, we decided to introduce our tiny country to him. In a way that will probably appeal to him the most.\nwith subtitles, so @POTUS can understand my introduction #zml https://t.co/MZyIrw98wt \n— Arjen Lubach (@arjenlubach) January 23, 2017 \n\nThanks David Klass ! \nRelated Laughing Squid Posts A Pissed Off Trump Fields a Steady Stream of Media Questions in an SNL Parody of His Press Conference A Bad Lip Reading of the First Republican Presidential Debate in Cleveland, Ohio Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Debate With Sick Rhymes in Epic Rap Battles of History ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:36:06.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
