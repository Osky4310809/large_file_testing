Last Updated: 22/02/17 11:33am \nThe Williams FW40 Williams stole a march on their rivals by becoming the first team to offer F1 fans a look at the sport's new era of cars when they revealed computer-generated preview images of the FW40. It has been a disrupted winter for the Grove outfit with Valtteri Bottas' departure to Mercedes prompting Felipe Massa to u-turn on his retirement. But the team are also expected to announce the arrival of Paddy Lowe in the coming weeks. \nThe Sauber C36 Have Sauber gone 'old school' with their new car? The C36 features a striking new blue and white livery with the front-wing also splashed with gold paint. Under the bodywork, the car will once again be powered by a Ferrari engine but Sauber have also confirmed they will start the new 2017 with a 2016-spec power unit. \nThe Renault RS17 Renault were the first team to physically unveil their car in an official launch, and the London event didn't disappoint. As soon as Jolyon Palmer and new driver Nico Hulkenberg lifted the covers off the RS17, the distinctive wings and livery immediately stood out - with the French outfit adding a large splash of black to their usual yellow. Renault's 2017 challenger is the first car where team bases at Enstone and Viry have combined with 'perfect harmony', and outlining his plans for the season, team chief Jerome Stoll said he wants to jump from ninth to fifth in the standings. \n2017 car launches", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:59:25.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
