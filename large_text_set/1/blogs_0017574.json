Warner's outfield speccy 0:44 \nWarner will be in the second group to travel to the UAE, having earned a break following his latest SCG masterclass in Sunday’s series-clinching victory over Pakistan. \n“David has had a very big summer and will benefit from a break in cricket, both mentally and physically. He will travel to Dubai in the second group of departures to coincide with those players arriving from the one-day series in New Zealand. \n“This gives Aaron an opportunity to return to the side. His form in the Big Bash League has been very good and he has earnt his recall.” \nIn all, there are seven members of Australia’s 16-man Indian touring party selected — including skipper Steve Smith. \nSquad", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:06:03.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
