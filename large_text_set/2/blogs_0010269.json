The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) is formally asking for donations to buy water for Surigao residents,\" Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo announced on Monday, February 13. \nThe DSWD is now accepting cash donations which will be used to buy water sourced in Butuan, Taguiwalo said. Cash donations can be deposited to: \nDSWD Dollar Saving Account para sa Foreign Donation Account Name: DSWD FOREIGN DONATION Account Number: 3124-0055-81 Bank Address: Land Bank of the Philippines Batasan Branch, Constitution Hills, Quezon City \nPeso Current Account Bank Address: Land Bank of the Philippines Batasan Branch, Constitution Hills, Quezon City \nDonors should notify DSWD-Finance Management Service (FMS)/ Cash Division (CD) of their donation through phone or email. They should send the validated deposit slip together with basic information (name, nationality and address) to and or fax to 931-8127. \n“We need to continue the provision of relief assistance to the citizens of Surigao, and this includes water. There is no way that people can function well and survive without a steady supply of water for drinking and for other household needs. Filipinos who want to help our kababayans in Surigao can donate cash to the DSWD and we will immediately purchase more drinking water which we will distribute to communities,” Taguiwalo said. \nThe DSWD Field Office has earlier bought and delivered to Surigao City 3,500 pieces of 6.6-liter bottled water and 500 pieces of 4-liter bottled water, estimated at P1,554,471. There are also 3,900 family food packs ready for distribution to affected families in Surigao City amounting to P 1,324,611. \n“There is a likelihood that the water system repairs will not be completed soon so we must prepare contingency plans to ensure that people in Surigao still have water to drink,” Taguiwalo said. \nTaguiwalo flew Sunday morning to Surigao City with President Rodrigo Duterte. She also coordinated with DSWD Field Office Caraga and officials of other government agencies tasked to address calamities. DISASTER RESPONSE.
