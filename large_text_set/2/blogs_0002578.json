After that, though, Fox will air another X-Men TV series that's directly connected to the movie continuity, with Burn Notice creator Matt Nix attached as showrunner . \nAside from the main story premise (two parents on the run from the government with their mutant child), there's been only vague teases of how this new TV series will fit into the movie continuity, and which X-Men movie characters we may (or may not) see on the small screen. With not an even a title to go on, it's hard to put in any kind of reasonable guesswork. \nHowever, thanks to Production Weekly , we now have at least a working title for Nix's X-Men TV series: \n“X-Men: Supernova” (w/t “Dark Phoenix” / “Teen Spirit”), “X-Men” (aka “Hellfire”– w/t“Heaven”) \nThe first entry is the upcoming X-Men movie from Bryan Singer, but the second one is the new TV series that Nix is running. Some fans may see the \"Hellfire\" part and jump into a frenzy of excitement, but we must caution that \"Hellfire\" was just the name of the old X-Men TV series concept that never fully formed, so it could just be a holdover until Nix's series has an official title. \nThat's all to say: don't jump to any conclusions just yet. \nAs for the working title \"Heaven\"? It is just a working title and, as always, should be taken with a grain of salt. \nHowever, the TV series production sync with the upcoming movie has some fans wondering if a crossover is possible - something that Bryan Singer himself recently teased , saying, \" Some crossover is all I can really say... I think there’ll just be crossover and standalone. It’s just the right thing to do. The X-Men universe is every bit as big as the rest of the whole Marvel universe, so why not? ” \nLegion premiers on FX on Feb. 8.
