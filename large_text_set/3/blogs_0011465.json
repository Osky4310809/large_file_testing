Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe romance in this year’s FA Cup was alive and kicking at the Clock End of the Emirates Stadium. \nNine thousand fans from Lincolnshire sang their songs, waved their banners and generally had a blast. \nIf you are going to enjoy a day to remember then you have to create it. \nAnd boy, did the Impvasion go with a swing. \nFor while the FA are under pressure to reinvent the world’s most famous knockout competition, there is clearly life in the old girl yet, judging by the antics in the away end. Lincoln's fans showed the romance of the FA Cup lives on (Photo: PA) \nThe importance of these fantastic dates on football’s calendar has been lost on many of the glitterati. \nWeakened teams, dwindling attendances and falling interest among supporters, it’s importance has been diluted. \nThis year, the powers-that-be decided to dispense with replays at the last-eight stage. Teams can now make four substitutions if the match goes into extra time. \nBut the FA Cup did not need any artificial stimulation, and Lincoln’s fans did not need any viagra from the authorities to get themselves up for this. \nHowever, that’s where the story had to end. Arsenal were 5-0 victors over their non-league opponents (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nArsene Wenger could not buy into the dream. He just could not afford to. \nFrom the moment the Frenchman handed in his team-sheet to match official Anthony Taylor – the pair came face-to-face for the first time professionally since Arsenal’s boss shoved the referee in the tunnel two months ago – any such notion had to be stamped upon. \nThere was no dewy-eyed sentimentality as far as Wenger was concerned. \nIt was kill or be killed. Arsene Wenger surely couldn't have survived a home loss to Lincoln (Photo: AFP) \nIf Lincoln City, yes Lincoln City, had broken open their tool box and hammered home a nail, then it would have been the final one in Wenger’s coffin. \nArsenal’s punters would not have known whether to laugh or cry. The humiliation of being a national embarrassment for a few days would, possibly, have been outweighed by the fact that the 20-year reign – that has hung like a lead weight around Wenger’s neck these past few months – would have finally dragged him under.
