The Toms and Jax of ‚ÄúVanderpump Rules‚Äù were spotted around the mountain town By Sara Grant , The Know March 13, 2017 \n‚Äî Jax Taylor (@mrjaxtaylor) March 12, 2017 \nOne of reality TV‚Äôs most bromantical bromances visited Colorado this weekend when the Toms (both Sandoval and Schwartz) and Jax Taylor of Bravo‚Äôs ‚ÄúVanderpump Rules‚Äù were spotted tweeting and ‚Äògramming around Breckenridge. \nThe L.A. trio of models/bartenders/bubbas traded in dresses ‚Äî they proudly dressed in drag for Tom Schwartz‚Äôs bachelor party in a recent episode ‚Äî for ski jackets and goggles during a ‚Äúguys weekend‚Äù of shredding a little Colorado powder. \nThe first breadcrumb was dropped by Tom Schwartz Saturday evening, though ominous to those not familiar with the base of Peak 9 or the Breckenridge Resort logo.

Megan Kahler was visiting Breckenridge from Fort Myers, Fla., when she met Sandoval and Schwartz at Jake‚Äôs Dive Bar. She said they were approachable and happy to pose for photos, an added bonus to an already great trip. ‚ÄúThey blended right in and no one I was with knew who they were,‚Äù she added.
