(Photo: National Science Foundation/Youtube) \nWhile SAM has the ability to pick up bricks, apply mortar and lay them, the robot needs to be heavily supervised. \nHuman workers still need to set up the robot, supervise health and safety and assist with laying bricks at difficult angles, as well as clearing up, according to Construction Robotics.
