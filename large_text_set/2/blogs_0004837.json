Jones , USA TODAY Published 10:07 a.m. ET Feb. 7, 2017 | Updated 22 minutes ago \nScarlett Johansson raises her voice at the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 21. (Photo: Noam Galai, WireImage) \nScarlett Johansson isn’t afraid to get Under the Skin when it comes to politics . \n\"(I believe) that it is really important to hear people in various positions of power voice their opinions, their story,\" the actress asserts in her March 2017 Marie Claire cover story, out Feb. 14. \"Why not? Why can't I have the voice? Why can't I use my platform? What's the point of having it if you don't use it? If you don't want to get involved, please, the noise is loud enough. But if you've got something to say, say it.\" \nOn the subject of the gender wage gap, Johansson is plainspoken: \"Just because I'm the top-grossing actress of all time does not mean I'm the highest-paid — I've had to fight for everything that I have.\" \n\"Some people felt I should talk about my personal struggle in order to shed a spotlight on the greater issue,\" she adds in reference to systemic sexism. \"Maybe I'm being presumptuous, but I assumed it was obvious that women in all positions struggle for equality. It's always an uphill battle and fight. My experience with my close female friends and family is that the struggle is real for everybody. Everyone has been discriminated against or harassed — sexism is real.\" \nBut while Johansson acknowledges our culture's woman problem, she stops short of acknowledging how that issue is compounded for women of color, particularly in Hollywood, which has come under fire for its perceived whitewashing of stories. \nJohansson herself was caught up in the whitewashing conversation after her casting in the live-action remake of Japanese manga and anime Ghost in the Shell . But, when asked about the subject, the actress pointed to the opportunity her casting presented for women, overlooking Asian actresses who were shut out . \n\"I certainly would never presume to play another race of a person,\" she told Marie Claire . \"Diversity is important in Hollywood, and I would never want to feel like I was playing a character that was offensive. Also, having a franchise with a female protagonist driving it is such a rare opportunity. Certainly, I feel the enormous pressure of that — the weight of such a big property on my shoulders.\" \nOnly time and press tours — where the issue will undoubtedly raise again — will tell how the star handles it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:45:32.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
