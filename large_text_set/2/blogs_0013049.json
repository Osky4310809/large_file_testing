Davao City Information Office/Released \nMANILA, Philippines – Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio on Thursday slammed Antonio “Sonny” Trillanes IV and challenged him to show proof of the illegal P121 million she allegedly owns. \n“If Trillanes can show where my alleged P121 million is right now and how it became illegal, kunin natin at ibigay ko sa inyo lahat,” Duterte-Carpio said in a statement reaction to Trillanes’ claims. \nTrillanes earlier held a press briefing at the Senate and revived allegations of undeclared wealth that he raised against President Rodrigo Duterte during the election campaign. He said he will resign if proven wrong. \nThe senator also showed a list of bank accounts allegedly owned by Duterte family. He claimed the presidential children, namely Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte, Duterte-Carpio and Sebastian Duterte have an account containing P104 million, P121 million and P143 million, respectively. \nDuterte-Carpio said she read Trillanes’ statement and denied these allegations. She said she never pretended to be what she’s not.   \n“Wala akong postura labas sa kung ano ang nakikita ng lahat,” she said. \nThe presidential daughter said Trillanes’ claim was directed to her father. Trillanes alleged Duterte's bank account reached about P2.4 billion from 2006 to 2015 with money from illegal activities. \nDuterte-Carpio let her father address the challenge of Trillanes \n“Lets us allow PRD to decide on how he wants this issue to go down,” she said. \nDuring the presidential campaign, Duterte presented his Bank of the Philippine Islands peso and dollar accounts before members of the media. \nHe brought 11 passbooks and showed that the current balance of then mayor and his daughter's joint account is at P17,816.98 since March 31, 2014. \nTrillanes however claimed the issue was not addressed and called on the president to release a history of bank account transactions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:26:10.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
