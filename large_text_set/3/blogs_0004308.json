By Tom Phillips Published 07/03/2017 \nBungie's final Destiny event brings back the game's finest hour: its first raid Vault of Glass. \nA newly-released teaser for the upcoming Age of Triumph shows players within the Vault once more - and again tangling with its time-travelling boss Atheon. \nNearly three years on from Destiny's original release, Age of Triumph is designed to be a worthy send-off for the game, and those who are still playing. \nAge of Triumph adds the game's largest Record Book of accomplishments to complete - 12-pages worth - including challenges tied to your class. Will you need all three classes to complete it? \nDestiny's mysterious Speaker character is back. In the original game he's voiced by Bill Nighy, who seems to return here for the first time in three years. Maybe he was in the soundbooth to record for Destiny 2? \nBungie will show off Age of Triumph in three weekly livestreams starting this Wednesday. Our best guess for its arrival would be the game's following Tuesday reset, on 28th March. \nAs for Destiny 2, or whatever subtitle Bungie comes up with, you won't be able to transfer over gear or progress from Destiny 1 .
