(Reuters) \nDays after the Malayalam actress molestation case broke out as a shocker from Kerala, Pulsar Sunil, who is the main accused in the case, has surrendered to Kerala police. This marks a major breakthrough in the case. Earlier, Pulsar Sunil had reportedly phoned his legal counsel on the night of the crime, met him the following day to file the vakalath and thereafter driven to his residence in Ambalapuzha, where the cops had almost nabbed him but missed. Further to his meeting, he had filed an anticipatory bail plea before the Kerala High Court which was deferred to March 3rd. However, his legal counsel said that they had documents to prove his innocence and would fully cooperate with the law. \nYesterday the cops had made his sister call him and plead with him to surrender to the cops. This was slammed by sections of the media as being ‘drama’ concocted by the police to fool the people and to cover up the fact that they were not able to nab the main accused in the case. Political leaders in Congress and BJP had also openly mocked Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan regarding this, alleging that Pulsar Sunil enjoyed protection from the ruling party and that is why the cops are unable to nab him so far. \nAlso Watch: \nFollowing this, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had assured the media that the guilty would not be spared and that the police were in full swing with search operations across the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:40:27.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
