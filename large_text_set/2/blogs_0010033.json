In addition to pulling out a jaw-dropping performance , the artist also joined the winners list for best urban contemporary album. (Hopefully the first of many victories for the night.) Beyoncé went on stage to accept her award — she stopped to say hi to her daughter Blue Ivy , naturally — and offered powerful words about why she made Lemonade . Not only was she hoping to \"give a voice to the pain\" people of color feel at times, but she hopes to inspire children \"of all races\" all over the world.
