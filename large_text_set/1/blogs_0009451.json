There are no fears he could leave. \n\"Juve are one of the best teams in the world and this is a place where you arrive, not pass through.\" \nDybala is contracted until mid-2020 with Juve, who are four points clear atop the Serie A table. \nThe win over Bologna saw the club set a record, becoming the first team in Italian history to win 26 straight Serie A matches at home.
