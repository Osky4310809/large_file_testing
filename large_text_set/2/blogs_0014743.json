Nothing in this world is as distressing and nasty as dealing with a fuckboy. They start up a conversation so carefully that they don’t leave any stone unturned so as to impress you and get into your life. Once they have the access to it, believe it, you’re trapped and you have no way out. No matter how hard you try, you’re not getting out that easy.\nNeither are they going to respect you nor care about your feelings, they’ll just want things to go their way and make you their puppet so you do as they want. Sometimes I feel they have some sort of special powers or the ability to perform black magic to cast a spell upon you so you’re entangled for the rest of your life. They are not going to make you happy, they’re not going to let you move on, they’re not going to listen to anything you’ll say and will still make you want them LOL.\nAnyhow, this blog is a compilation of my personal experiences and what all have I felt as I’ve dealt with these deceptive assholes. Enjoy!\n1. “Let’s chill in the car, it’s too hot/cold outside.” Translation: I’m just desperate and wanting I only want to make out with you, we can’t do that outside.\n2. ” I wanna spend quality time with you, we’ll go some place quiet and alone.” Translation: LOL, I am just finding a chill place where there’s no one so we can make out in peace because obviously I’m so desperate.\n3. “Night stay at hotel? Would be fun with no one around, we’ll chill.” Translation: Hotels are the best place to make out so might as well fulfill my desires there.\n4. “Exchange pictures? You can trust me babe.” Translation: It’s 2 am and I’m clearly horny and desperate.\n5. “I love you but we’re not getting into a relationship just yet.” Translation: Lie,lie,lie. I obviously can’t get my ass in trouble. If I get into a relationship with you I can’t fuck around with rest of the 200 girls I just made fall in love with me.\n6. “Is your home empty? We’ll Netflix and chill.” Translation: Come over and fuck.\n7. “I respect my parents a lot, they mean the world to me.” Translation: I really don’t care, gotta throw some mainstream shit to make you fall for me. I don’t even pick their calls when I’m out with friends even if they call me 20 times LOL.\n8. *insults you* “I’m sorry baby I didn’t mean that.” Translation: Totally meant that. Why would I care how you feel? You’ll always be coming back to me, what have I to lose?\n9. “I’m sorry, I’m not able to give you time, I’m busy with work/college/school. Hope you’ll understand.” Translation: Couldn’t care less.\n10. “I have no clue about my career.” Translation: The fuck’s ambition? I just wanna fuck around my whole life, make bitches fall for me, fulfill my personal desires. I clearly have no clue about my career because I don’t have any goals in my life except being a fuckboy. Thanks for the love and support though. Achieved a huge milestone.\n11. “Why do you want my phone? If you wanna make a call, lemme do it for you, sweetie.” Translation: I’m obviously not handing you over my phone. Let’s get it straight- you the dumb one not me. I don’t want you to find my “secret folders” that have pictures of other lasses I’m fucking around with or read their messages. I got this shit sorted. Giving you my phone is risky as hell as it could ruin everything. Can’t afford to lose even one girl. Desperation runs in my blood.\n12. “We’ll meet soon, I’m busy right now.” Translation: Ain’t hanging out unless I get some action.\n13. “You’re right baby. I was at fault. I’m going to change and never repeating it again.” Translation: 2 days and I’m making a comeback. That’s the most I can do lmao.\n14. “I’ll quit smoking/drinking for you. You’re more important.” Translation: Not happening. Never happening.\n15. “My friends are my family. They’re the best.” Translation: Just another breed of fuckboys.\n16. “It’s okay don’t send a picture/ It’s okay don’t give me a kiss/ It’s okay don’t hangout with me a night. Why would you wanna anyway? You don’t trust me right?” Translation: Just going to make you feel guilty for not doing what I asked you to do and you’ll say yes in no time.\n17. *fights*, *doesn’t text back for 20 days*, *after 20 days* “I’m soo sorry, I miss you so much. I love you. Please come back?” Translation: Wow, that was a real nice 20-day break from one girl. Time to get back to business.\n18. *replies after 7 hours/2 days while still active on other social sites* “I’m sorry I was busy.” Translation: No one disturb me until I complete my daily stalking session. It takes time you know.\n19. *I type a long ass paragraph with lovey-dovey shit* *replies the same every time in one line* “Aww that’s so sweet/ You’re so cute/ I love you.” Translation: Aww you thought I cared because I get that shit like every other day lol.\n20. “I don’t wanna meet your friends right now, I’m very shy. It’ll be awkward. Maybe some other time?” Translation: Your friends are gonna figure everything out and ruin it for me. It’s better to stay away. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:01:23.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
