The Raiders and NFL would provide $500 million while the city would provide $200 million in infrastructure improvements and Fortress would advance $150 million in land, which local government would repay. \nThe NFL previously objected to Fortress controlling seat licensing, sponsorships and suites, ESPN’s Jim Trotter reports . But the revised proposal limits Fortress’ involvement as a partner to providing a traditional loan, similar to what Raiders owner Mark Davis got in a commitment from Bank of America for the proposed move to Vegas. \nLas Vegas already has approved $750 million in public financing for a $1.9 billion stadium on the Strip that the Raiders would share with UNLV. Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer reports that while the NFL would prefer to keep the Raiders in the Bay Area (the sixth-largest TV market in the U.S.) over allowing them to move to Vegas (the 40th-largest TV market), the league rejected Oakland’s previous stadium plan. \nA vote could come next week at the NFL owners meetings in Phoenix, which begin Sunday. Davis needs at least 24 of the 32 owners to approve the move to Vegas. \n“They certainly have not led me to feel unrealistically optimistic about what the results will be on Monday,” Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf told Trotter. “But they have been fair, they have been honest and they have been responsive.” \n“I recognize that this could be our final chance,” Schaaf said, “but we have worked so hard these last two years. We’ve put together a viable deal that satisfies many requirements that we believe is the best deal for the Raiders and the NFL. We hope that they give it full consideration on Monday.” \nThe Raiders applied to move to the Los Angeles area last year, but the league turned down that request in favor of the Rams moving from St. Louis. The Chargers will join the Rams in the Los Angeles area this season and the teams will share a stadium in Inglewood, which is expected to open in 2019. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:16:40.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
