Hormonal changes during pregnancy bring a lot of changes in the body that pop up from time to time. \nAbout half of all pregnant women experience nausea and sometimes vomiting –commonly called morning sickness – in the first trimester. Mood swings, sleep problems, lower back pain and swelling in the feet are also common discomforts associated with pregnancy. \nBut no matter how much you have read up on pregnancy, or how much advice you get from your mother or other elder family members, there are some pregnancy symptoms that should set off alarm bells . \nIt’s important, especially if you’re pregnant for the first time, to know which symptoms should be brought to your doctor’s attention to ensure the safety of yourself as well as your unborn baby. \nHere are 10 pregnancy symptoms that you should not ignore. 1. Reduced Fetal Movement \nBetween 17 and 18 weeks, most mothers start to feel their baby move. Baby movements get stronger around 24 weeks. Many pregnant women even notice that their babies are more active at certain times of the day, as the fetus begins adapting to a more regular sleep-wake cycle. \nBut if your baby’s movements have slowed or stopped all of a sudden and you cannot feel any movement for hours, see your doctor immediately. \nA long absence of movement can signal low amniotic fluid, which may mean the mother is simply dehydrated and drinking plenty of water will resolve the problem. \nAt times, a rupture in the amniotic sac can lead to leakage of the amniotic fluid causing decrease in fetal movement due to problems with nutrition and oxygen for the embryo. Plus, it increases the risk of infection. \nReduced baby movement after the 38th week of pregnancy may raise the need for induced delivery to prevent the danger of the umbilical cord getting compressed, cutting off blood flow to the baby. \nA reduction in a baby’s movements should be taken seriously and brought to your doctor’s attention. Many women who have had stillbirths noticed their baby’s movements had slowed down or stopped. 2. Spotting and Bleeding \nVaginal spotting or bleeding during pregnancy can make any woman freak out. Just a spot of blood is nothing to worry about. Spotting is usually a normal sign that the embryo is implanting in the uterus . \nBut heavy bleeding should not be ignored. It can be a sign of something serious — miscarriage, placental abruption or placenta previa. \nA 2009 study published in Obstetrics and Gynecology reports that heavy bleeding in the first trimester, particularly when accompanied by pain, is associated with higher risk of miscarriage. On the other hand, spotting and light episodes are not, especially if only lasting one to two days. \nA 2013 study published in the Journal of Family and Reproductive Health reports that vaginal bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy may predict further maternal and fetal complications. \nThe study also reports that second-trimester bleeding and preterm labor were significantly more prevalent in pregnant women with first-trimester bleeding. \nRegardless of what may be causing spotting or bleeding during pregnancy, it’s a good idea to call your doctor. 3. Vaginal Discharge \nIt’s normal to have an increase in clear vaginal discharge during pregnancy. But a significant increase in vaginal discharge or a change in the type of discharge, such as discharge that has become watery or contains blood, means it’s time to see your doctor. \nDuring the second trimester, an increase in vaginal discharge may mean the cervix is opening up early. This can be an early sign of miscarriage. \nIf you are leaking fluid from your vagina before 37 weeks, it may mean that your water has broken early and it’s time for your baby to come into this world. \nAfter 37 weeks of pregnancy, an increase in mucus discharge indicates that it’s time to go into labor soon. 4. Fever \nAny fever during pregnancy must be taken seriously. A fever can be associated with a number of reasons ranging from kidney infection or pneumonia. Irrespective of the cause, a fever during pregnancy by your doctor as it can have adverse effects on the health of the pregnant woman as well as the unborn baby . \nIn a 2014 study published in Pediatrics, researchers did a meta-analysis of studies on fevers during pregnancy and health impacts in the offspring. They found that a fever during pregnancy was associated with increased health problems among babies, such as neural tube defects, congenital heart defects and oral clefts. \nThe study suggested between a 1.5- and nearly 3-fold increased risk with fever exposure in the first trimester. \nIf your temperature is above 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius) and you don’t have any flu or cold symptoms, call your doctor immediately. A fever higher than 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) for a prolonged period of time is harmful for the unborn baby. 5. Severe or Persistent Abdominal Pain \nAny kind of pain in your abdomen before the 37th week is a matter of concern and you must see your doctor immediately. \nA pain on either side of the lower abdomen during the first trimester can mean that you have simply stretched a ligament. However, it can also indicate a miscarriage. Such pain during the second or third trimesters may indicate an ectopic pregnancy, premature labor or placental abruption. \nPain in the middle or upper abdomen, with or without nausea or vomiting, can be caused by severe indigestion, heartburn or even food poisoning. It can also be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that requires immediate attention. \nAt times, abdominal pain may indicate an appendicitis, and a delay in diagnosing it increases the risk of fetal mortality. 6. Rapid Weight Gain \nAlthough there are no set guidelines to decide the amount of weight gain considered normal during pregnancy, here are some weight gain recommendations for pregnant women by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: For pre-pregnancy BMI less than 18.5, expected weight gain during pregnancy is 28 to 40 pounds For pre-pregnancy BMI between 18.5 and 24.9, expected weight gain is 25 to 35 pounds For pre-pregnancy BMI between 25.0 and 29.9, expected weight gain is 15 to 25 pounds For pre-pregnancy BMI 30 or more, expected weight gain is 11 to 20 pounds \nHowever, sudden weight gain during pregnancy could be dangerous as it is a key sign of a pregnancy complication called preeclampsia. \nIf you are suddenly gaining 4 or more pounds a week, then you need to see your doctor right away. Excess weight gain during pregnancy could also be a sign of gestational diabetes.
