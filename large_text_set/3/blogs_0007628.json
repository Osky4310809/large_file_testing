Here's a teaser of the same! Check it out. By Aarti Iyengar | Published: March 10, 2017 9:45 am comments \nThe teaser of Game of Thrones season seven has finally arrived and it is just as epic as one anticipated. The official page of GoT on Twitter shared the teaser video that is going to make July seem way too far. The date of release was actually announced in the night via Facebook Live where they created a giant ice block that would melt, provided you typed “FIRE” and “DRACARYS”. Oh yes, it started off as a fun ride but soon turned annoying as all we wanted to do was just know the date! So anyway, finally, we managed to completely break the ice and there flashed the date on the screen, July 16, 2017. But that’s not all fandoms. They have also released a teaser video of the same but with better special effects and a captivating story spelt out by Daenerys Targaryen. \nNow now fans, we know just how excited you are as we can totally relate to it. So we’ve brought together both the videos! There’s the Facebook Live video where the network clearly took a lot of delight to create, so they could unveil the date of release in the most wicked way possible. You can check out the awesome live below and give yourself the pleasure of playing the GoT game. \nALSO READ – Game Of Thrones season 7: The official poster teases Fire vs Ice \nHere’s the teaser! In the teaser, with Emilia Clarke’s v/o, is a story recited of what we have to look forward to. There’s a nice introduction of the houses left who are set to battle it out for the throne. But there’s a catch, they’ll have to first protect themselves from the menacing White Walkers, who have woken from the dead. The teaser has some really badass visuals with house sibils made of stones and how after collisions with each other, have perished into ashes.
