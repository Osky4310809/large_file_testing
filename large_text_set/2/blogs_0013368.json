Confirming that having a toilet had been declared mandatory for Muslim marriages in the three states of the country, Maulana Mahmood A Madani, Secretary General of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind asserted that soon this mandate will be applied in others states as well. \n“Maulvis and muftis in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana have decided that they will not solemnise the ‘nikah’ or Muslim marriage in a house where there are no toilets,” he said. \nMadani, who is also a former Rajya Sabha MP, stated this during the inauguration of Assam Conference on Sanitation (ASCOSAN) 2017 conducted here in Khanapara last week. \nAlso Watch: \n“I feel that all religious leaders from all the religion throughout the country should decide that they will not conduct any rituals in houses where there are no toilets,” he said. \nEmphasising on cleanliness and sanitation, he asked people to use toilets and also to make not only Assam but the country as a whole clean. \n“There are two types of cleaning – one is external and the other internal. Both are interconnected, we will only be able to achieve the internal cleaning if our body is clean,” he said. \nTh conference was held with the aim to showcase Assam’s commitment towards Swachh Abhiyan. Also speaking at the conference, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal emphasised on the importance of sanitation and hygiene.
