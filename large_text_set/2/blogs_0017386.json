Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSutton's reserve keeper Wayne Shaw has denied he broke FA rules when he ate a pie on the touchline against Arsenal. \nThe roly poly goalie could be facing a potential FA betting probe after scoffing a pasty in the 83rd minutes of his side's 2-0 defeat to the Gunners. \nUnited's betting sponsors had offered odds of 8-1 for Shaw to eat the pie live on air. \nFA rules say players should not “instruct, permit, cause or enable” any person to bet the “result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in, a football match or competition.” Shaw scoffs a pie during the loss to Arsenal (Photo: BBC) Sutton United's substitute Wayne Shaw eats a pie (Photo: REUTERS) Read More Sutton United manager slams 'roly poly' goalkeeper Wayne Shaw over pie-eating 'stunt' during Arsenal match \nPlayers are also not allowed to give others insider details “any information relating to football” which has been “obtained by virtue of his or her position within the game”. \nBut 23-stone Shaw insists he did no wrong and did not influence the bet by telling his teammates his intentions. \n“I think there were a few people,\" Shaw told Good Morning Britain. \"Obviously we [Sutton's players] are not allowed to bet. I think a few of the mates and a few of the fans. \n“It was just a bit of banter for them. It is something to make the occasion as well and you can look back and say it was part of it and we got our ticket money back.

He said: “I think Wayne has become this global superstar on the back of being 23 stone. He’s made that a chance to make some more media coverage off the back of it. \n“The reality is I don’t know [if Shaw did it for a bet] but it wouldn’t surprise me. I don’t think it shows us in the best light.” \nThe FA refused to comment on a potential investigation. \nLucas Perez and Theo Walcott netted for the Gunners to set up a quarter-final match-up with National League side Lincoln.
