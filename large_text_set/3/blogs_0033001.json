The act will need to be amended by the Government to ensure Ireland meets its EU obligations as laid down under the 'Polluter Pays' principle. \nRefunds will be paid to those who have already paid their bills, but this will have to be administered by the Government. \nThe committee will meet next week to agree outstanding issues such as the roll-out of metering. \nBut this is unlikely to pose any major difficulty after Fianna Fáil agreed to accept a proposal for all new builds to have meters installed as a precondition. \nIt remains unclear whether this will also apply to refurbishments. \nPolitically, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were claiming victory last night. \nFine Gael said that almost 71,000 households could face penalties as a result. The party also told TDs that maintaining Irish Water represented a major achievement. \nFianna Fáil said it had ensured there would be \"equal treatment\" for all households, including those on group water schemes. The party also said that a referendum on public ownership would be held.
