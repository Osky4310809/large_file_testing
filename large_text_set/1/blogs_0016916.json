Tom Brady and Bill Belichick will look to become the firsts to ever win five championship rings after the Patriots defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers , 36-17, in the AFC Championship .\nIt was one of the best postseason performances of Tom Brady’s career, as the 12-time Pro Bowler finished with 384 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions. In seven career meetings against the Mike Tomlin-led Steelers, Brady has now thrown 22 touchdowns without a single interception.\nThe Patriots jumped on the Steelers early with a 10-0 lead after the first quarter, but it was a 19-0 start to the second half for New England that buried Pittsburgh.\nBrady finished the first half with two touchdown passes, connecting with Chris Hogan for each score. The second came on a flea flicker play that drew Steelers safety Mike Mitchell close to the line of scrimmage and allowed Hogan to run free for a 54-yard touchdown bomb:\nBut what may have been most impressive about New England’s performance Sunday was the shutdown showing of the Patriots defense against Ben Roethlisberger and the explosive Steelers offense. \nRoethlisberger finished the day with 314 yards, one touchdown and one interception. But his only touchdown of the day came in the final minutes of the fourth quarter when the Patriots were well in control. He finished without a touchdown pass in Pittsburgh’s 18-16 win over the Kansas City Chiefs , but he had the play of Le’Veon Bell to complement the pass offense.\nBell suffered a groin injury early in the game and finished with only 20 yards on six carries. While DeAngelo Williams scored a touchdown in his place, the veteran running back managed just 34 rushing yards on 14 carries and Bell’s contributions were sorely missed.\nRoethlisberger appeared to connect with tight end Jesse James for a touchdown late in the second quarter, but a review showed he was just short. \nPittsburgh squandered the goal-line opportunity and was eventually forced to settle for a field goal. Another red zone chance came in the fourth quarter and the Steelers again were unable to punch in a touchdown, instead turning the ball over on downs with an unsuccessful fade attempt to Cobi Hamilton .\nThat drive also had what appeared to be a touchdown pass for Roethlisberger, but it was nullified by an illegal touching penalty.\nAntonio Brown was also relatively quiet Sunday, finishing with 77 receiving yards on seven receptions while dealing with double coverage for much of the day.\nWith the win, the Patriots advance to face the Falcons who are vying for their first ever Super Bowl victory. Atlanta’s only other trip was in January 1999, but the Falcons lost to the Denver Broncos 34-19 in Super Bowl XXXIII.\nThe Patriots have much more history on the biggest stage with four titles, all of which came during the Belichick and Brady era. Chuck Noll is the only other coach with four Super Bowl victories, and Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw are the only other quarterbacks. \nBrady is the all-time leader in every major passing category in the playoffs and reached 60 career postseason touchdowns Sunday. His already tremendous resume has a chance to get even better now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:52:43.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
