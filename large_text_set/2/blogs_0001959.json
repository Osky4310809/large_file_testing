The transports would continue until late February . Seven decades after the end of World War Two , the movement of German troops to eastern Europe, even on a NATO mission, remains a sensitive issue both in Germany and the region. \nOn Monday the U.S. military deployed thousands of soldiers and heavy weaponry to Poland, the Baltic states and southeastern Europe in its biggest build-up since the Cold War. \nThe 28-nation Western alliance decided to move four battalions totaling 3,000 to 4,000 troops into northeastern Europe on a rotating basis to display its readiness to defend eastern members against any Russian aggression. The deployments focus on Poland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which fear Moscow could try to destabilize them by cyber attacks, territorial incursions or other means. \nThe military buildup meant to put pressure on the Kremlin, is the largest since the Cold War and could put into question the NATO-Russia agreement permanently banning the deployment of significant forces by the alliance in Eastern Europe. NATO rejects such notions, saying the agreement did not specify how big a force should be for it to be considered “significant,” and insists that the deployment is rotational rather than permanent. \nThe bloc decided to boost its military presence on the Russian border in the wake of the political crisis in Ukraine. The most vocal members of NATO, such as Poland and the Baltic states, claimed that Russia could attack them after the events in Ukraine, prompting leading members of the alliance to agree on the troop deployments. \nMoscow has denied any aggressive intentions towards NATO members and says the bloc is using a pretext to compromise Russia’s national security. The Russian armed forces have boosted their strength near the western border in response to the buildup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:05:26.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
