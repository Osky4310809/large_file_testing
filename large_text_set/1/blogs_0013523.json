Well just a day after hitting us with the official video for “Drugs ,” the N.O. Crooner decides to waste little time in sharing its follow up single called “Wait.” \nNo word yet is this will see life on the album or not, but considering it's an Apple Music release the chances are highly likely. Hit play and let us know what you think of the sultry R&B ballad. (Single available on iTunes ) \nQuotable Lyrics: \nDon't think for a minute that I'm a foolDon't know what I'll do if I lose youYou need someone who will be there to hold youI can't even say that it's fair, but I doHoping I will always be here if you need meWhat I gotta say isn't easy \n- August", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T08:18:24.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
