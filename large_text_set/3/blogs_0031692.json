Greenberg had been leading the investigative unit on an interim basis since the departure of Richard Esposito in September 2016 . \nNBC News president Noah Oppenheim made the announcement in an internal memo to staff earlier this afternoon. \nGreenberg is an NBC News veteran. Before taking over the investigative unit, he was part of the Standards team, and had a 9-year run as an Emmy award-winning producer for Dateline, specializing in international stories. \nGreenberg was a producer for 60 Minutes and spent time at ABC News earlier in his career. \nHere’s Oppenheim’s note: \nColleagues, \nI’m very pleased to announce that Rich Greenberg will officially become VP & Executive Editor of the NBC News Investigative Unit, a role he has held on an interim basis for the last few months. The Investigative Unit is an essential driver of exclusive and original content, and a personal priority of mine. Under Rich’s leadership, our excellent team has had an impressive run breaking news on Russian interference in the election, the recent Navy SEAL raid in Yemen, and the growing scandal surrounding Dr. Larry Nassar, the women’s team physician for USA Gymnastics. \nRich comes from Standards, where almost everyone in the organization had the chance to benefit from his sound counsel. Before that, he was a producer at Dateline for 9 years, where, among many other things, he developed a deep expertise on Iran, and has helped lead the network’s coverage of the country ever since. He also produced a groundbreaking hour on child trafficking in 2004, which won two Emmys and led to the rescue of dozens of children and the arrest of predators in Cambodia and Canada. Before joining NBC News, Rich was a producer for 60 Minutes. He began his career at ABC News. \nPlease join me in congratulating Rich. \nNoah", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:38:44.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
