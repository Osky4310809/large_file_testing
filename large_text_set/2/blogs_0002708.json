Are you aware of the sizing in this store?” \nAbbie Walsh-Greenfield, 20, believes her treatment on Monday was down to her size and wrote an open letter to the lingerie chain on her blog, Wales Online reports. \nShe wrote: “Stores like this don’t intimidate me. Walking around this store is the same as walking around the next. \n“I didn't feel uncomfortable by the lack of XL’s (I actually don’t believe that I saw one in that size, anyway), nor by the 5 X-Smalls, 4 Smalls, 2 Medium, 1 Large and 0 X-Large ratio that seemed to be a common theme on the rails around the store. It wasn't even that, that had bothered me.” Victoria's Secret says it is reaching out to the customer \nAs she walked around round the store, she says that one of the shop assistants walked past her “average sized friend” and said to her: “Hi.. Are you aware of the sizing in this store?” \nShe said it left her feeling uncomfortable, so she left. \nShe wrote: “I don’t actually know what the sales assistant meant by her comment, but surely there’s no two ways about it. \n“I can’t even imagine another sentence that she could have tried to say.” \nMs Walsh-Greenfield said: “I know I am not a small person and I think that is why she said it. Read More \n“I was going to go back and complain but I did not want to put myself in that store.” \nMs Walsh-Greenfield said she believes off-hand comments can really affect people with low self esteem. \nShe went on to spend money at Ann Summers instead, because she was made to feel comfortable. \nShe finished the letter: “So, just to let you know Victoria’s Secret Cardiff, I spent £100 in Ann Summers that exact day, and probably got double what £100 would have got me in VS.

They made me feel comfortable.” \nIn a statement, a Victoria’s Secret spokesperson said: “Victoria’s Secret expects that all customers be treated with respect. \n\"We are reaching out to the customer and will take the appropriate actions as we’re committed to ensuring that everyone feels welcome in our stores.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:05:47.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
