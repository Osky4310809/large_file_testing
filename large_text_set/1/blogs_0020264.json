Of course they are amazingly talented, and who wouldn’t love to go shopping with them, but the best thing about the pair of sisters is how relatable they come across in their interviews! So during an interview with Variety Studio we couldn’t help but understand when Elle Fanning revealed why she’s glad she stopped being homeschooled . Although we hated the tests , early wake up times to get on the bus, and homework, we would’t trade the lessons we learned in the school hallways and classrooms for anything.\nDuring an interview with Variety Studio, Elle Fanning described what it was like going from home-schooling to being in the classroom. It’s interesting because we just assumed any girl would want to be on movie sets, shooting ad campaigns, and attending award shows, but Elle Fanning just wanted the normal high school experience.\n“I was homeschooled for awhile until I was nine and then I was like ‘I have no friends mom’ that are my own age I need to go to a regular school”. Spring break over. Back to early school wake-ups. \nA photo posted by Elle Fanning (@ellefanning) on Apr 11, 2016 at 7:34am PDT \nWoke up this morning as a High School GRADUATE \nA photo posted by Elle Fanning (@ellefanning) on Jun 14, 2016 at 11:26am PDT \nThis isn’t the first time that Fanning talked about trading in homeschooled life for biology classrooms and cafeteria lunches. But according to her interview with Nylon Magazine, her reason for pushing to go to school involves her parents as well.\nI decided to give myself a birthday present... a public Instagram.... SURPRISE! \nA photo posted by Elle Fanning (@ellefanning) on Apr 9, 2016 at 2:38pm PDT \n“My parents have known each other since second grade, and they’re still together. They didn’t start dating until college, but they always talk about their high school, and I was like, ‘I have to have that! I want to experience all the proms and be able to talk about that one kid everyone knew.'” But just because she loved going to school, did not mean she couldn’t wait to graduate.\nDecided to share a personal photo of me receiving my diploma at graduation \nA photo posted by Elle Fanning (@ellefanning) on Jun 18, 2016 at 11:05am PDT \n“I was homeschooled up until third grade, and I liked it because my grandma taught me, and I loved being with my grandma,” said Elle Fanning in an interview with Interview Magazine. “ “But then I didn’t really have any friends,” she continued, “None my own age. So my mom put me in school in fourth grade. It’s cool because I’ve realized things about myself that I wouldn’t have if I weren’t in school. My favorite subject is science, which is so weird because I would think that my favorite subject would be, I don’t know, something more artistic. I only have two more years left now because I’m a sophomore. But I’m also excited to get out of school.”\nLIVE BY NIGHT LA PREMIERE \nA photo posted by Elle Fanning (@ellefanning) on Jan 9, 2017 at 11:59pm PST \nAlthough we don’t miss going to high school, we can definitely relate with Elle that those experiences made us who we are today!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:32:50.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
