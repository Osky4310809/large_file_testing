A 75-year-old man died in hospital last night , becoming the fourth victim. One patient remained in critical condition. By Thursday evening eight people had been arrested on suspicion of preparing for terrorist acts. The Westminster victims, meanwhile, have been remembered by friends and family . \nAuthorities have named British-born Khalid Masood, 52 , as the terrorist who was shot dead at the gates of parliament. He was born in Kent, reportedly as Adrian Elms, and most recently lived in Birmingham. Masood/Elms apparently assumed a number of other names over the years. He committed a string of crimes including criminal damage, assault, grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. He got on MI5’s radar as a possible violent extremist but was ultimately considered only a “peripheral figure” in that regard . He spent time in jail but not for anything related to terror, according to the government. \nLast night thousands gathered in Trafalgar Square for a vigil where the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, declared there would be no victory for terrorism . We usually appreciate our sketch writer John Crace for his cutting takes on the absurdities of parliamentary happenings – on this occasion he describes a poignant day of proceedings in the Commons honouring victims, praising the brave and voicing defiance towards those who would try, as Theresa May put it, to “silence democracy”. \nHis way or the highway – Donald Trump has delivered an ultimatum for the House of Representatives to pass his Obamacare replacement by Friday or he will let the bill lapse and “move on to other things”. With one of his key election promises, the travel ban, already in limbo, it is genuinely unclear whether divided Republicans can come together to deliver on a second big plank of his electoral platform, despite the party having a majority in both houses. \nAs Trumpcare remained bogged down in Congress, the president met with truckers and jumped into the cab of a prime mover, gurning and air-horning and generally making a bit of a goose of himself in front of onlookers. ‘I love trucks’: Trump involved in some big rigging \nTerm-time holidays – After a court ruled that parents cannot be automatically fined for taking their children on vacation during term, the number of such absences has risen by 100,000 in latest figures . The government in 2013 took away headteachers’ power to permit holidays during term, saying there is clear evidence they harm a pupil’s GCSE prospects. But an Isle of Wight father had a fine overturned after arguing his daughter’s overall attendance was good. School authorities appealed and the supreme court is expected to give its verdict soon. \nFriends reunited? Boris Johnson and David Cameron have been spotted having dinner together in New York. The pair who became foes over the EU referendum ate at the popular Red Rooster restaurant in Harlem . Boris Johnson leaves a restaurant in Harlem, New York, after having dinner with David Cameron. Photograph: Joanna Geary for the Guardian \nFormer Guardian journalist Joanna Geary got a snap and a chat as they emerged. We know the images are blurry but Johnson’s mop hair and Cameron’s rosy features can be readily distinguished. Johnson was over there for a counter-terrorism conference, Cameron for a speaking tour. \n‘No longer able to commit’ – Amy Schumer has announced she is quitting the forthcoming Barbie movie, citing scheduling conflicts. The comedian – who was trolled about her body shape after being announced in the lead role – said she was “bummed” at having to turn it down . Schumer had also been slated to work on the script. Sony films says it will have updates on casting soon. \nOne you, but many mothers – Don’t forget Mothering Sunday (the Briefing has the weekend off and won’t be around to remind you). Nell Frizzell argues Mothers Day is not just about the one who gave birth to you – the other women who have shown you care deserve a place in your thoughts too. You may have a few extra bunches of flowers to lug home from the train station … Lunchtime read: Something’s rotten in movie ratings \n“The worst thing that we have in today’s movie culture is Rotten Tomatoes.” You might tune out upon hearing that the quote came from Brett Ratner, producer of the very rotten Batman v Superman (so rotten I only bought the DVD, not the Blu-Ray). Son of Krypton tries to calm down Bat of Gotham about their Rotten Tomatoes score. Photograph: Clay Enos/AP \nBut Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw says that to some extent Ratner’s got a point about the website, which “mulches up” English-language reviews to produce an aggregate score, then awards metaphorical tomatoes in a corresponding state of freshness. Bradshaw agrees this is “certainly hurting the art of conversing about film. Whenever someone solemnly invokes a Rotten Tomatoes score you can feel the conversation become paralysed .” Sport \nReal Madrid are aiming to pri se Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois away from Chelsea , reports Sid Lowe. Football Association chairman Greg Clarke has condemned the “inappropriate, disrespectful and disappointing” behaviour of England fans in Germany on Wednesday night, while Barney Ronay says such trips are now a gap year for the Brexit generation . \nAs the Melbourne grand prix approaches, Lewis Hamilton says his Mercedes team is “up for the fight” this year, but the immediate prospects of golfer Rory McIlroy aren’t quite as bright: he’s out of the WGC Match Play Championship without hitting a ball in anger. \nAs England prepare for next winter’s Ashes trip, coach Trevor Bayliss says he is not a dictator , and that he’ll be disappointed if his side doesn’t perform well in June’s Champions Trophy tournament. Business \nThe shoe shop Jones Bootmaker may be about to disappear from high streets if a private equity deal to buy the 120-store chain collapses today. More than 1,000 jobs could also be lost as the group struggles with greater competition, the strong pound and higher business rates. \nThe Asian markets have been fairly flat as they wait for the US healthcare vote. The pound barely moved against the dollar, buying $1.25 and €1.16. The papers \nFront pages are again dominated by the Westminster attack but mostly moving on from the event to the background of the killer and the repercussions. \nThe Times revisits the scene of PC Keith Palmer’s death with its picture but uses the headline “Killer was Muslim convert”. The Daily Mirror, 24 March 2017 Photograph: Mirror \nThe Sun splashes with a new picture of the attacker on a stretcher after being shot and reports that on the morning of his assault he told staff at a Brighton hotel: “I’m off to London, it isn’t what it used to be.” \nThe Mirror has a poster front page of a candlelight vigil saying “Evil will not win”. The FT has “Home-grown Islamist named by police as Westminster attacker”. \nThe Mail is probably the oddest of all the fronts. “Google, the terrorist’s friend”, its headline says, while reporting that it took just two minutes of searching online to find a manual for using a car for mass murder. \nFor more news: www.theguardian.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T09:50:48.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
