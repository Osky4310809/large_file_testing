But once I knew Ken would recover, I was thrilled with the storyline. Strong stories are great to do, as an actor they are very enjoyable.” \nTonight viewers watched in horror as Ken was found unconscious at the bottom of the stairs. \nWhile it was initially assumed his fall was caused by another stroke, in Wednesday's episode the police will launch an attempted murder investigation after discovering he’d been hit on the head by a mystery assailant prior to the tumble.

The list includes a murderer (Tracy), a drug dealer (Adam), a former alcoholic (Peter) and a student with a history of violence (Daniel) - and that’s just his family. \nOther contenders include grudge-bearing builder Phelan and Daniel’s girlfriend Sinead, who blames Ken for making her abort her baby. \nIn recent weeks Ken has fallen out with every family member. Unable to remember what happened, he’s now horrified that one of his relatives wants him dead. \n“There is a moment when he looks at them all and is terrified, as it could be any one of them because he has had rows with them all,” Bill said. “To find that it could be someone who is very, very close to you is very frightening. He is deeply hurt that a member of his family might want to kill him.” (Photo: ITV) \nKen goes to stay with Roy because he doesn’t know which of his family to trust. “As each one is arrested he thinks ‘it could be that person’,” Bill explained. “The paranoia would be huge, with each one there is a possible motive, an argument he has had which could have triggered it.” \nThe actor is loving the way that the Barlows have become “almost mafia like”. He added: “It occurred to me that I wanted to remain head of the family and have great stories and this is what is happening.” \nHe revealed that the soap’s cast have only recently been told who tried to kill Ken. “I hope the viewers enjoy trying to work out who it could be in the same way that we all did. It is very cleverly done and I am thrilled to bits with it.” Read More Coronation Street spoiler: Peter Barlow battles with his drinking demons as his life is torn apart by Chloe's lies The family wait at the hospital for news (Photo: ITV) \nHe now hopes that Ken can come back stronger. “I would like him to become the natural wise leader, the patriarch of his new family - a respected elder statesmen.” \nGood luck with that...
