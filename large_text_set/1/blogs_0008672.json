Anis Amri, the Tunisian man German authorities are certain drove a heavy truck into a crowded Christmas market on December 19 and killed 12 people, shot a selfie video of himself on the bridge shortly before the attack in which he claimed his allegiance to the Islamic State. Police have cobbled together a list of places Amri is known to have been just before and after the attacks, including a former mosque known as a Salafist meeting point, the street where Amri hijacked the truck and shot the Polish driver, a restaurant in Gesundbrunnen district where Amri met a fellow Tunisian the night before the attack and the train station where Amri was caught on video just after the attack. Italian police shot and killed Amri on December 23 following a routine check near Milan.
