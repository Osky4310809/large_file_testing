A Guardian/ICM poll suggests they have a 31-pt lead over Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell on economic competence.

With the budget due tomorrow, ICM asked people which team they thought was better able to manage the economy properly. The results were: \nTheresa May and Philip Hammond: 43% \nJeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell: 12% \nNeither: 29% \nDon’t know: 17% \nConservative lead: 31 points \nThis is obviously a terrible figure for Labour, not least because many people believe that economic competence figures provide a better guide to who will win a general election than headline polling figures. The ICM tables, which will go online later this morning, suggest that even among those who voted Labour in 2015, only 26% think Corbyn and McDonnell are better able to manage the economy properly. \nICM asked the same question in a poll in July last year (pdf). In that poll Corbyn and McDonnell were on 15%, so they have gone down 3 points. \nBut is it not all good news for the Conservatives . In July May and Hammond were on 53%. Their figures has fallen by 10 points over the last eight months. \nThat might be because their “honeymoon” is over, or it might be because people are feeling more sceptical about the prospects of anyone managing the economy properly. In July last year 16% responded “neither” to the question. That figure has now gone up 13 points to 29%. \nThere were some more figures in the poll on social care. I will post them soon. \nICM Unlimited interviewed 2,028 adults aged 18+ online on 3 to 5 March 2017. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n10am: The OECD publishes its interim economic outlook. \n11am: Peers resume their debate on the article 50 bill. A vote is likely at around 12pm on a Lib Dem call for a second referendum and then another is due at around 5pm on giving parliament a vote on the Brexit deal. This is the vote the government is expected to lose. Later peers will debate the third reading of the bill and by the end of the evening it will have cleared its passage through the Lords and be ready to return to the commons. \n12.45pm: MPs debate the child and social work bill’s report stage. Some Tory MPs are backing an amendment that would require councils to say whether they can take more children under the Dubs scheme, although it is not clear yet whether this will be put to a vote. \n4pm: Rob Wainwright, head of Europol, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. \n4.30pm: The Labour MP Lisa Nandy gives a speech to the IPPR. \nI will be focusing on the Lords debate mostly today but, as usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter.
