Benjamin has in turned partnered with Swedish global footwear and outerwear brand Tretorn for a new adventure that not only finds him becoming creative director, but he will also be featured in a global brand campaign for Fall 2017, serve as the premiere artist in the Nylite 50 Artist Series, and design a 2018 capsule collection. \n“We’re excited to collaborate with Andre,” said Nick Woodhouse, President and CMO of Authentic Brands Group, owner of the Tretorn brand. “His creativity, unconventional personal style and unique point of view, as applied to our fresh and reimagined designs, will be an adventure.” \nThis year, Tretorn is launching a new global marketing campaign tapping into influential artists and tastemakers to celebrate its 50th Anniversary of the classic Nylite sneaker. The project will, again, feature André, in addition to other influencers to amplify content via digital and social media channels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:42:57.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
