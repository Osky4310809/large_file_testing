We will have to go and find another bike race to do.\" \nAn investigation by UK Anti-Doping is currently ongoing into allegations of wrongdoing in cycling involving Wiggins and Team Sky. \nCope, who used to work for Team Sky, was questioned by MPs earlier this month after he delivered a medical package to Wiggins, who retired in December, when he was racing at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine in France. \nTeam Sky have admitted \"mistakes were made\" around the delivery of the package but deny breaking anti-doping rules.
