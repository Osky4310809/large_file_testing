It's unclear when this screenshot was taken, as the mall could have filled more as the events got underway. \nHere's a screenshot from EarthCam a day later, when an estimated half a million people flowed through the US capital in order to raise awareness of women's rights. \nTwitter/@davidmackau \nIt's difficult to take accurate headcounts at events like these, where attendees often overflow into side streets. But the aerial photos give a more clear-cut look at how crowds compared. \nOrganizers guessed about 200,000 would join the march in DC. By late afternoon, a city official in Washington told the Los Angeles Times that organizers upped their estimate to 500,000. \nThe Washington Metro subway system reported that riders took fewer trips on Friday morning during Trump's inauguration than did during the Women's March a day later. Metro counted 193,000 rides as of 11 a.m. on Friday, as compared to 275,000 rides before the same time on Saturday when demonstrators gathered on the National Mall, according to Newsweek. \nFor more of Business Insider's coverage on the Women's March on Washington, click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:06:34.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
