Other tech leaders like Google’s Eric Schmidt claim that AI is not something we need to necessarily be afraid of. \nArtificial intelligence makes it possible for a software to learn from experience, and make decisions based on its acquired knowledge. This feature results in an enhanced usability , as the AI algorithm observes the behaviour of individual users and with time adapts to their unique needs . \nThere are many of these smart WordPress plugins that utilize AI as their core function.
