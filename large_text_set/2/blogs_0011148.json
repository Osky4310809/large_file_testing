Violating privacy. #RentInOz February 15, 2017 Alex Bruce-Smith (@alexbrucesmith) #11 – my old roommate keeping old mugs in his room until it was basically a steaming pile of mould #RentInOz pic.twitter.com/GIJlKgQY7q February 15, 2017 \nThe most common problems with rental properties were found to be pests; doors or windows that did not close property; peeling paint or tiles coming off; leaks or flooding; and persistent mould. \nOne Twitter user ticked off the list and myriad other problems. “Shall I continue,” she concluded . “That’s just one house.” \nSurveyed tenants were quoted in the Choice report talking about rental properties with significant, in some cases structural, issues that were not being addressed by landlords. \nOne spoke of living in a house with “major plumbing issues”: “Plumber admitted he was close to giving up and [said] the house would be condemned with the sewage not working – a.k.a. all over the yard and laundry.” \nAnother lived in a house with a leaking roof that was “taking ages for them to repair”. \nThat was still an improvement on the experience of another interviewee, who said the roof had “caved in from water damage”, while the boards of the property’s deck were “so old they’re going to snap”. \nOne former tenant would have probably felt validated when “the dwelling was deemed unfit for living by the council”. \nThe survey found fear of retribution was common among tenants, particularly given the short supply of housing. Eighty-three per cent of renters were without a fixed-term lease and faced “constant insecurity”, Choice said. \n“Constantly worried that if I make a complaint we won’t be offered to rent again,” wrote one. “We would not be able to afford to move let alone afford new rent.” \nAnother tenant reported being told, upon signing a lease, that the house would be left as it was, “otherwise the rent would be put up”. \nOne was given notice to leave a property that had been home for five years after requesting some maintenance work be done, including to fix a bathroom that flooded during rain. \n“The owner said it wasn’t worth his while to have tenants … He gave me plenty of notice and got very angry when I secured a new rental property within days of getting his notice, he told me I couldn’t leave now. But bad luck for him as the notice to leave said I had to be out by a certain date, I got out well before.” \nAnother said similar: “I was given a notice to leave after landlord had two minor costs for maintenance. Said he would rather have no tenants.” \nChoice is calling on people to share their experiences using #RentInOz so that it can better campaign for tenants’ rights. But some Twitter users were disappointed to learn that the hashtag did not refer to the rock musical. Gabrielle (@g_coffee) I thought #RentInOz was trending because Rent the musical was coming to Australia. I'm a bit disappointed now :( February 15, 2017 LB 💁🏽 (@hairflipheroine) Was hoping #RentInOz was about Rent the Musical being revived in Oz. It isn't. It's just as disappointing as the rent in Australia tho ✌🏽", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:11:49.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
