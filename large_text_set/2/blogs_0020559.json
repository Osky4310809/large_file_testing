With growing concerns over conflict diamonds as well as the rising costs of owning a diamond , many are leaning toward alternative engagement rings as an ethical, more budget-friendly option. \nOther gems are not only more affordable, they are also uniquely beautiful. Who can forget Kate Middleton's gorgeous heirloom sapphire engagement ring? Even if you're absolutely convinced, don't rush to buy that colored stone just yet. Before you purchase your gemstone engagement ring, there are a few things you should know. The Three Best Gemstone Choices \nEvery gemstone has a different hardness factor. Basically, the hardness of any stone will tell us how resistant that stone is to being scratched. \nWe rank this hardness on a scale of 1 to 10 known as the Mohs Scale . One of the reasons the term \" diamonds are forever\" exists is because diamonds are considerably more durable than any other gemstone and rank 10 on the Mohs Scale. \nThis isn't to say that a diamond can't be broken or chipped, but more that if you rub a nail against the surface of a diamond, it won't leave a scratch. \nThe following gemstones rank close enough to a diamond to be considered durable enough for everyday wear. \ncontinue reading below our video Alternatives to Diamonds | Engagement Ring Guide Ruby \nMohs Scale: 9.0 \nNatural ruby is a timeless choice for an engagement ring because it is one of the three precious stones on the market that will look just as beautiful as the day you bought it for many years to come. Sapphire \nMohs Scale: 9.0 \nSapphire has been one of the most popular stones for engagement rings for centuries, even before diamonds became the gem of choice. This is likely due to the stone's incredible scratch resistance and beautiful navy and cornflower coloring. Aquamarine \nMohs Scale: 7.5 - 8 \nAquamarine will show scratches on its surface over time if proper care isn't taken. It may even chip if you're not careful. However, this stone is extremely popular because of its unique light aqua coloring. \nSome of the lighter varieties of aquamarine can be confused with diamonds. Aquamarine is not quite as hard as blue topaz, but unlike blue topaz, these gems are usually all natural and are much more expensive. The Three Worst Gemstone Choices \nWhen choosing a ring that you will be wearing every day, it's important to take the Mohs Scale into consideration. There are also other factors to consider, like how prone the stone is to being chipped. \nIf you have your heart set on one of the following stones that is ranked poorly, choose a very protective setting. Take extra care while wearing your ring, and make sure your stone isn't scratched or submerged in any liquids for an extended period of time. sisu / Getty Images Pearl \nMohs Scale: 2.5 - 4.5 \nEven though pearl is one of the softest gems available, many people are still drawn to the idea of using a pearl or pearls in their engagement ring. One small imperfection in the nacre or outside layer of the pearl can cause the entire coating to detach and become damaged. \nPearls are also often glued into place which makes them very susceptible to falling out and becoming lost. Jan Sochor / Getty Images Emerald \nMohs Scale: 7.5 - 8 \nEven though emeralds are pretty resistant to scratching, they are not recommended for engagement rings because all the inclusions and cavities within the gemstone make the stone extremely susceptible to cracking and chipping. \nSome jewelers are reluctant to set expensive emeralds without having the customer sign a waiver due to the risk involved. Ton Zwartjens / EyeEm / Getty Images Opal \nMohs Scale: 5.5 - 6.5 \nOpal is one of the most beautiful and magical gemstones, though it has long been known by some to be bad luck. Part of this superstition has to do with how soft these stones are. \nSurface scratches can often be overlooked and hidden due to the opaque nature of the stone, but the tendency for chipping makes this stone a poor choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:41:50.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
