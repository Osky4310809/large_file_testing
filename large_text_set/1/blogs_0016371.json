PUBLISHED: 17:11, Wed, Jan 18, 2017 | UPDATED: 17:20, Wed, Jan 18, 2017 \nThe deadly Mount Paektu, which straddles the borders of North Korea and China, is responsible for one of the deadliest eruptions in human history, and scientists fear that it could blow again. \nNearby nuclear weapons testing from the Kim Jong-un regime could trigger an eruption as rumblings could upset lava beneath the surface, scientists have previously stated. \nNow, new studies show that the eruption could eject far more sulphur into the atmosphere than previously thought, which could devastate life on Earth. \nMount Paektu once underwent one of the most devastating eruptions in history in 946AD when it erupted so powerfully that it formed a five kilometre caldera at its summit and produced enough ash that it even showered Japan â€“ almost 1,100km away.
