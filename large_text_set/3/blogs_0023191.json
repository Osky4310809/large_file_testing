He was a four-time Super Bowl champion and earned 10 Pro Bowl berths, helping turn Pittsburgh into one of the premier organizations in football. He said: \nWhen you sign on with the Steelers, you're signing on with an organization that you gotta put your job, as [former coach] Chuck [Noll] always told us, there was God, family and football. And when you start to put yourself above all of that, then the selfishness comes into place, then you get individual acts like the ones then that I personally think is a detriment to the entire organization and what we're trying to do in Pittsburgh. ... That's a youthful mistake, but in my view, I just don't think that it should be tolerated. \nBrown, the Steelers' leading receiver and arguably their best player, went on Facebook Live following the win over Kansas City. His recording, which was mostly filled with boisterous celebrations from himself and teammates, also included coach Mike Tomlin 's postgame speech to the team. \nTomlin later admonished Brown for the fiasco, who publicly apologized for the distraction. The Steelers lost their following game, an AFC championship clash with the New England Patriots . \nSteelers owner Art Rooney said Brown's antics were \"little annoyances, with the emphasis on little\" in January. The team signed him to a new five-year contract this offseason.
