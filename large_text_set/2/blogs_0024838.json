Associations with adolescent asthma and the relevance of the timing and patterns of exposure are unclear. Knowledge of critical windows of exposure is important for targeted interventions. Methods We used data until age 17 from 1454 children of the Dutch population-based PIAMA birth cohort. Residential SHS exposure was assessed through parental questionnaires completed at ages 3 months, 1–8 (yearly), 11, 14, and 17 years. Lifetime exposure was determined as; a) time window-specific exposure (prenatal, infancy, preschool, primary school, and secondary school); b) lifetime cumulative exposure; c) longitudinal exposure patterns using latent class growth modeling (LCGM). Generalized estimation equations and logistic regression were used to analyze associations between exposure and asthma at ages 4 to 17 years, adjusting for potential confounders. Results With all three methods, we consistently found no association between SHS exposure and asthma at ages 4 to 17 years e.g. adjusted overall odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.67 (0.41–1.12), 1.00 (0.66–1.51) and 0.67 (0.41–1.11) for prenatal maternal active smoking, infancy, and preschool school time window exposures, respectively. Conclusion We assessed lifetime SHS exposure using different methods. Different timing and patterns of SHS exposure were not associated with an increased risk of asthma in childhood and adolescence in our study. More longitudinal studies could investigate effects of lifetime SHS exposure on asthma in adolescence and later life. Keywords Secondhand smoke Asthma Longitudinal data Environmental epidemiology Background Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) along with exposure to other environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors has been found to be associated with asthma [ 1 – 3 ]. Since asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases and most asthma begins in childhood and adolescence, exposure to SHS during these periods is of particular interest [ 4 ]. Prenatal and early life postnatal exposure to SHS has been found to be associated with an increased risk of asthma during the first 10 years of life [ 2 , 5 – 8 ]. Studies of the association of asthma with SHS exposure later in life and studies of the association between lifetime SHS exposure and adolescent asthma are scarce. Consequently, the relevance of SHS exposure later in life and for adolescent asthma is largely unknown. To date, four prospective studies [ 6 , 9 – 11 ] have assessed the association of pre and postnatal SHS exposure on asthma in adolescence but results are inconsistent. Only one study out of these considers SHS exposure throughout childhood. Longitudinal cohort studies seldom pay attention to patterns of exposure over time. Exposure to SHS during different time windows may also differentially affect the presence of asthma, therefore knowledge of critical time windows of exposure is important in implementing targeted interventions. Therefore, in this study, we aim to use three methods to determine the role of timing of SHS exposure and investigate if there is a critical time window of SHS exposure that contributes to asthma up to adolescence, and to examine cumulative exposure and detailed longitudinal patterns of exposure from repeated measures and investigate their associations with asthma prevalence at age 17. Methods Study population and design We obtained data from the Dutch population-based PIAMA (Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy) birth cohort that started with 3963 children born in 1996/1997 [ 12 ]. Questionnaires were completed by parents during pregnancy, 3 months after birth, then yearly from age 1 to 8; and at ages 11, 14 and 17 by both, parents and children. Questionnaires comprised questions on SHS exposure and asthma symptoms, diagnoses and medication as well as socio-demographic characteristics, parental atopy, and other environmental exposures and lifestyle characteristics. Our primary study population consists of all adolescent children with complete data on both asthma at age 17 and SHS exposure from pregnancy until age 17 ( N  = 1454, Additional file 1 : Figure S1). Ethics statement Ethical approval was obtained from authorized institutional review boards. Children’s parents or legal guardians and children themselves provided written informed consent. SHS exposure assessment We assessed SHS exposure through the repeated parental questionnaires from pregnancy till age 17. Exposure at age 17 was assessed using the adolescent questionnaires if the participant had moved out of his/her parents’ home ( N  = 50). Postnatal residential SHS exposure was assessed by reports of anybody smoking inside the home (yes; yes, but less than once a week; never). In addition, the number of cigarettes smoked per day for those who answered ‘yes’ was obtained, and at ages 1–4, information on smoke exposure outside child’s home if children regularly spent at least half a day outside their home. Lifetime SHS exposure was determined using three methods: First, we distinguished five time windows. To optimize the implementation of potential preventive measures during a specific time window we chose time windows for ages that match appropriate settings for prevention in the Netherlands: prenatal period (pregnancy), infancy time window (3 months after birth) corresponding to prevention in well-baby clinics, preschool time window (1–4 years) for prevention through infant health care, and primary school (5–11 years) and secondary school (>12 years) time windows for prevention in primary and secondary school, respectively. Time window-specific exposures were assessed as detailed in Additional file 1 : Figure S2. In brief, for the prenatal period, four categories were defined: maternal active smoking, maternal sometimes passive smoking (>4 h per day), maternal rare passive smoking (1–4 h per day), and never (no active or passive smoking). Exposure during infancy was defined by the 3-month questionnaire using the original categories. Exposure during preschool, primary school and secondary school time windows was determined through categories created from two to five questionnaires: if the response to the question on anyone smoking in the house was ‘yes’ for the whole time window, children were classified as ‘always exposed’; if the response was ‘yes’ at least once during the time window, children were classified as ‘sometimes exposed’; if the response was ‘yes, but less than once a week’ at least once and ‘never’ otherwise, children were classified as ‘rarely exposed’; if the response was ‘never’ during whole time window, children were classified as ‘never exposed’. Second, lifetime cumulative SHS exposure was defined based on the well documented dose –response relationship of SHS and asthma [ 13 ] by assigning points to questionnaire responses on SHS exposure (prenatal exposure: maternal active smoking = 2 points, any maternal passive smoking = 1 point; neither active nor passive smoking = 0 points; postnatal exposure for each questionnaire: yes = 2 points; yes, but less than once a week = 1 point; never = 0 points) and summing score points for all questionnaires from pregnancy to age 17. The score ranged from 0 (no SHS exposure) to 26 points (highest exposure at all 13 follow-ups). Children with SHS exposure were divided into three categories of equal size defined as passive low (scores 1–3), medium (scores 4–12) and high (scores 13–26). Third, in order to combine exposure during different time windows and account for cumulative exposure, we used a data-driven approach known as latent class growth modeling [ 14 ] (LCGM, TRAJ procedure in SAS 9.4, Cary, USA) to define lifetime longitudinal patterns of exposure from pregnancy to age 17. These patterns reflect the different underlying subpopulations existent within the whole population based on the probability of being exposed to SHS over time. The procedure allocates individuals based on the probability of belonging to a particular pattern taking into account the status of exposure at each time point and translates it into a cumulative pattern over time. The higher the probability, the higher the likelihood of being allocated to that particular pattern. SHS exposure was dichotomized at each time point for this procedure (any exposure, yes/no). To determine the number and shape of patterns of SHS exposure in the population, we first assumed that there is one homogeneous non-changing pattern of SHS exposure from pregnancy till age 17, by specifying the intercept only. We then further investigated if there was more than one pattern and different pattern shapes by including more groups and higher order polynomials. We repeated this procedure for models assuming up to five groups of patterns for polynomials up to the order of three (models with six or more patterns did not converge). All models were compared and the best model was defined as one with smallest BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion). Asthma definition Asthma at ages 4 to 17 years was defined by the presence of two out of the following three criteria based on parental questionnaires: wheezing in the past 12 months, doctor diagnosed asthma ever, and prescription of asthma medication in the past 12 months according to the MeDALL protocol [ 15 ]. We also defined asthma phenotypes based on age of onset and persistence as follows: “early transient” defined as any asthma according to the definition described above between 4 and 6 years but not later, “persistent” defined as asthma between 4 and 6 and between 14 and 17 years; “intermediate onset” defined as first asthma between 7 and 11 years, “adolescent onset” defined as first asthma between 14 and 17 years; and never defined as no report of asthma at ages 4–17 years. Statistical analyses We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to analyze associations of asthma at ages 4 to 17 years with SHS exposure during the prenatal, infancy and preschool time windows; multiple logistic regression models to analyze associations of asthma at age 17 with SHS exposure during the primary and secondary school time windows, as well as cumulative scores and the longitudinal patterns of exposure; and polytomous logistic regression to analyze associations of asthma phenotypes with exposure during the prenatal, infancy and preschool time windows. Age-specific estimates of associations with exposure during prenatal, infancy and preschool time windows were obtained from GEE models with exposure-age interaction terms. In analyses of exposure patterns, the pattern variables were included as exposure variables in the model. Observations were weighted according to posterior probabilities of belonging to a particular pattern of exposure to account for uncertainty in allocation of individuals to patterns. Adjusted and unadjusted analyses were performed adjusting for the following potential confounders identified from literature and prior knowledge: parental education (defined as maximum of either mother’s or father’s education; low, medium, high), gender, parental atopy, breastfeeding (>12 weeks: yes/no), having older siblings (yes/no), maternal age at birth (continuous), active smoking (smoking at least once a week at 14/17 years), resident region at birth (north, middle, west). Time-varying confounders such as presence of pets (yes/no), gas cooking (yes/no), presence of dampness and moulds (yes/no), and overweight (yes/no/unknown based on BMI using the International Obesity Task Force gender-specific cut-off points [ 16 ]) were selected from the earliest available questionnaire. Exposure to ambient air pollution was estimated by land-use regression modeling [ 17 ] and defined as annual average nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) concentration at the home address at birth. We performed a number of sensitivity analyses. In order to investigate the possible effect of selecting children with complete SHS data, we repeated analyses with extended populations; i.e. children with complete exposure information for a specific time window instead of from birth till age 17 for time window-specific exposures and individuals with asthma data, but incomplete SHS exposure data ( N  = 1871) for the longitudinal patterns. We repeated adjusted analyses with time-varying confounders defined based on the latest available questionnaire (14/17 years). We also excluded active smokers from all analyses and additionally adjusted for low birth weight, which could be on the causal pathway between asthma and SHS exposure. Modifications of the association between SHS and asthma by parental atopy, presence of pets, gender and parental education have been suggested [ 18 – 23 ] and were explored in stratified analyses. All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4. Statistical significance was defined by a two-sided alpha of 0.05. Results Study population characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Half of the children were boys, 60% had highly educated parents, and 52% had atopic parents. Parents who reported any SHS exposure from pregnancy till age 17 ( N  = 823) were less often atopic and less often highly educated than parents who did not report any exposure (Additional file 1 : Table S1). Asthma prevalence ranged from 5% at age 17 to 8% at age 4 (Additional file 1 : Figure S3). Prevalences were 7, 3, 4 and 1% for early onset, intermediate, persistent, adolescent onset asthma. Baseline characteristics were similar for the study population and the excluded population except for higher prevalence of high parental education and breastfeeding and a lower prevalence of pet ownership in the study population (Additional file 1 : Table S2).
