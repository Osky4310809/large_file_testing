I'm sure they will stay up. The players will have to step up a bit but you have to be confident in a coach who did what he did last year. \n\"I don't think Leicester are doing anything differently from what they did last year but this time it seems to me the chemicals are different. \n\"You have to keep working and it will come back. I have been through situations like this in my career. You keep doing the right things and it will come back to you. \n\"That's the magic of football. It appears and disappears very quickly. \n\"I haven't spoken to him - sometimes it's better to keep quiet - but I wish him all the best.\" Stars from last season have failed to replicate their performances (Photo: Rex Features) Read More Martin Keown accuses Riyad Mahrez of 'laziness' following Leicester's defeat at Swansea \nZola played for Ranieri at Chelsea between 2000 and 2004 and at Napoli between 1991 and 1993, and understands the growing pressure on the Italian. \nThe Stamford Bridge legend has won just once in 12 games after replacing Gary Rowett at Birmingham in December but said the experienced Ranieri would not be fazed by Leicester's struggles. \nHe added: \"It's our life, we know as a coach, our world is very unstable so you have to be used to that. You have to be prepared and be strong in these moments and don't lose your focus and concentration. \n\"This is our world, this is my world and I have to live in it. It doesn't take away any enthusiasm, any passion for the game and it doesn't change my idea how football should be done.\" poll loading Will Claudio Ranieri last the season as Leicester manager? 500+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T21:20:30.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
