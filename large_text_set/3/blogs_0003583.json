It took a second for The Mighty O to answer and probably because she was picturing her and First Lady Gayle King waving to their subjects outside of the White House. Oprah eventually said that she never thought it was possible, but now that she knows you don’t need to know shit about government to be president, she’s looking at “President Oprah ” as something that can really happen.\n“I actually never considered the question even a possibility, I just thought, ‘Oh! Oh!’ I thought, ‘Oh gee, I don’t have the experience. I don’t know enough.’ But now I’m thinking, ‘Oh! Oh!’\n……no, that won’t be happening, but I did used to think that you had to know so much more than you have to know.”\n“…that won’t be happening. ” Okay Oprah, don’t act like there currently isn’t an Oprah/Oprah 2020 campaign office housed in the east wing of your Montecito mansion. Yes, I said “ Oprah/Oprah.” She can do both jobs!\nAnd if you thought Jabba the Trump brought the theatrics when announcing his cabinet picks, then you really haven’t seen shit. Because President Oprah will line up Dr. Phil (UGH), Dr. Oz, Nate Berkus, Iyanla Vanzant, Suze Orman, Rachael Ray and Bob Green , and say to them all in front of the cameras, “You get a cabinet position! And get a cabinet position! And you get a cabinet position! ”\nHere’s part of the clip where Oprah thinks about becoming POTUS. I want to turn her “ Oh! Oh !” into a ringtone. It sounds like a really polite orgasm.\n\nPic : Splash", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:45:06.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
