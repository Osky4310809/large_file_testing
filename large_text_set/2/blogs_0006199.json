Why? Well, an undeniable primary reason is pure jealousy.\nOne kid's sign at the New England Patriots' Super Bowl championship parade on Tuesday captured it all perfectly.\nSEE ALSO: Noted Boston guy Mark Wahlberg has handy excuse for leaving Super Bowl early\nIn a photo that made the Twitter rounds on Tuesday morning, we see a young Boston fan who says he's already been to 10 championship parades despite being alive only 15 years. (And he's not above gloating about it.) Let's fact-check this real quick.\n@KFCBarstool @BarstoolBigCat yaboooo #5 pic.twitter.com/IYHY71ylfB\n— Derek Schleer (@donniedanger9) February 7, 2017\nSo this kid's 15? Let's presume he was born in 2001 then, and will turn 16 this year.\nNow to crunch the numbers.\nIn 2002, the Patriots won the Super Bowl.\nIn 2004, the Boston Red Sox won the World Series. The Patriots also won the Super Bowl that year.\nThat Pats team also won the Super Bowl in 2005.\nIn 2007, the Red Sox won the World Series again.\nIn 2008, the Boston Celtics won the NBA Finals.\nIn 2011, the Boston Bruins won the NHL's Stanley Cup Finals.\nIn 2013, the Red Sox won the World Series again.\nIn 2015, the Patriots won the Super Bowl again. Two days ago, they won it again.\nYep — count 'em — that's 10 championships in 15 years. Lucky little dude. At least he seems to appreciate his good fortune.\nBONUS: This device can make any pair of headphones wireless", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BarstoolBigCat", "https://t.co/IYHY71ylfB", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Vqw2ZFrs.jpg", "https://twitter.com/donniedanger9/status/828983388031823876", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Vqw2ZFrs.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/KFCBarstool"], "published": "2017-02-08T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:59:47.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
