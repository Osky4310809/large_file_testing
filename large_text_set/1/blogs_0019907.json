There is actually a Game of Thrones restaurant in Scotland and we are SO booking a flight there ASAP. Okay, maybe not right away, but it’s definitley on our bucket list.\nIn case you didn’t hear us, there is a Game of Thrones restaurant. It actually exists and every GOT fan should start saving now so they can dine like Starks — or whoever your favorite character is.\nThroughout the series, we’ve seen a lot of drinking and feasting and some terrifying dinners as well, but this pop-up establishment blends all the good food parts together.\nSince everyone is stuck waiting for Season 7 to premiere , why not focus on this amazing restaurant instead? Thanks to event producers, The Pop-Up Geeks there is finally a Game of Thrones themed bar…complete with mulled wine and show props.\nAt #bloodandwinebar we always keep our arms at the ready, the Red Wedding has made us paranoid!

It’s in Edinburgh, Scotland to be exact, taking over as a temporary pub called Blood and Wine. Seems fitting for all-things Westeros , don’t you think?\nIn case you weren't sure whether to visit the Blood & Wine bar in January, we will be serving the Old Bears favourite mulled wine... see you there! ⚔️ #BloodandWine #GameofThrones #Edinburgh #bar #mulledwine #drinks #2017 #January #Scotland \nA photo posted by The Pop up Geeks (@thepopupgeeks) on Dec 23, 2016 at 8:38am PST \n“Our Maesters have sifted through scrolls, trawled through parchments and painstakingly sampled the many wines, ales, spirits and infusions found within the pages of George R.R. Martin’s epic A Song of Ice and Fire series to source only the finest that the Seven Kingdoms have to offer,” the site explains, about its origin.\nOnly the finest cuts of Frey go into our homemade Frey pies!

We bet they’d even let you watch the series while drinking a pint and eating meat pies.\nBut what’s the catch? \nThe pub is only open on Wednesdays and Thursdays from now through February, so you better book your trip as soon as you can!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:27:29.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
