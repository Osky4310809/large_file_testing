During his time at Sony Entertainment, he oversaw the company suffer a massive breach — which also included a trove of leaked emails between Lynton and various Snapchat executives and investors. In those emails it was revealed that Snapchat bought a set of smaller companies , but also indicated the deeper involvement Lynton (an early investor) had with the company and some of the company’s future prospects.

Snap is expected to be valued north of $20 billion when it goes public . The company is also projecting to generate $1 billion in revenue this year , and is probably one of the most hotly-anticipated IPOs in the past few years. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:35:03.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
