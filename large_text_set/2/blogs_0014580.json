It might seem like a drastic decision, but I was 100% certain I was doing the right thing. \nDoctors didn’t question me. I may have only been 25, but I was in a long-term relationship and had three kids. They warned me it was near impossible to reverse, but I didn’t ever want to reverse it. \nAfter the procedure, it was like a weight off my mind. I was glad I did it. In fact, I was right about it up until the day I met a new man. Then, when I fell for Paul, I started to question my decision. \nI never expected my marriage to break down, but we simply started to grow apart and eventually broke up in 2009. It was three years after that I joined the dating app Plenty Of Fish and hoped for a message from one man in particular. \nPaul Drummond, 33, was kind, genuine and sweet. He had joked that he wouldn’t bite when I ignored his first few messages. But I had good reason. I was 37 then and wasn’t looking for a one-night stand. Younger than me and gorgeously topless in one photo, I wasn’t sure we would want the same thing. \nI had three beautiful children – Emma, 17, Sophie, 15 and Thomas, 13 – Paul didn’t have any. I’d presumed if I did fall in love again, it would be with someone who also already had a family, because there was no way I’d be able to have any more kids. \nMy ex had agreed sterilisation was the sensible thing to do. We loved our family, we were all set. They had clipped my tubes via keyhole surgery and, aged 25, I never needed to worry about contraception again. \nThat’s why Paul was posing a bit of a problem. I didn’t know if he wanted children, but I did know I wasn’t in a position to give him any. Despite not being able to see how our flirting could have any long-term prospects, I couldn’t stop thinking about him. \nSo in December 2012, I plucked up the courage to meet Paul. We talked for hours, it felt so effortless, and we agreed to meet again the next night and shared our first kiss. \nA few weeks went by, with Paul and I growing ever closer. I needed to ask him the question I’d been dreading. I wanted to be honest from the start, because there was no point getting emotionally attached to someone I couldn’t have a future with.

I had to break it to him that I’d been sterilised. It was too late. \nPaul looked as sad as I felt. I wondered if that was the end of our short-lived romance. But a few days later, Paul called and told me he’d been researching – sterilisation could be reversed. There was no guarantee it would be successful, but there was hope. \nIt didn’t worry me he had been so forward. I was touched that he’d researched it himself, it showed he really wanted to be with me. Our feelings for each other were hard to hide. \nIt was too early to know if Paul and I wanted kids together, but knowing it was an option meant we could let ourselves fall in love. I introduced him to my children and they adored him. By February 2013 we’d moved in together. A new life \nIn August 2013, age 38, I had the reversal procedure. Not available on the NHS, I’d paid £3,500 to go private. I was put to sleep while they removed the clipped part of my fallopian tubes and rejoined the ends. I was in hospital for three days. \nWe stopped using contraception and every month I’d take a pregnancy test, just in case. But it was always negative. Paul didn’t let it stop him hoping. In June 2014 we married in a boutique hotel in Cottingham. My son was our pageboy, my daughters were our bridesmaids. \nAfterwards, we left the kids at my gran’s and flew to Egypt for some snorkelling and sunbathing. Home from honeymoon, I felt sick and thought I should do a test. When a faint line appeared, I ran to Paul. He was so excited, he rushed out to get another test just to be sure. The kids were so happy for us. \nAn early blood test suggested a 1 in 225 chance of Down’s syndrome , but I declined further testing. We agreed we already loved this baby, no matter what. \nAt the 20-week scan, we found out we were having a girl. She was due in March 2015, but in January my placenta broke away from the womb and I needed a c-section. I was 29 weeks pregnant when, on 11 January, our baby made her early entrance.

I had a quick glimpse of her before she was taken to intensive care. She had a little pink face and was sticking out her tongue. We agreed to call her Matilda Peaches. An hour later we were allowed to visit her, but they’d covered her face with a breathing mask and a hat, so we couldn’t really see her. \nEventually a consultant mentioned they were testing for Down’s syndrome. Remembering the way her tongue was sticking out, I knew she had it. When it was confirmed, I allowed myself a quick cry, but Matilda was fighting for her life – that was all that mattered. \nThose strong lungs of hers only needed assistance for one day, then she was breathing on her own. I wanted to be strong just like her. \nAfter a few days I had my first cuddle. She was still covered in wires and tubes as a nurse placed her on me. She put her tiny hand on my chest and peered up at me. \nWith dark hair and blue eyes that sparkled, she looked at me as if to bravely say, ‘I’m OK!’ Paul and I gazed at her, promising that we’d give her the best life. Such a fighter \nMatilda spent 11 weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit. The older kids all came to meet her when she was strong enough. Like us, they adored her. Specialists warned us not to expect Matilda to meet her milestones at the same speed as ‘average’ children. \nCrawling, walking and talking would all come slowly to her, they said. It made us more determined to prove them wrong, and Matilda was determined too. Curious and adventurous, she smashed their expectations. \nPlus, we discovered local charities and online support groups, which became our lifeline. And we learned Makaton (sign language), so we could communicate with Matilda. \nMatilda is two now, and on 5 January this year I gave birth to Myles, a little brother for Matilda. I didn’t have any tests for Down’s syndrome because I don’t like the way they make parents feel like it’s a bad thing. Matilda has taught us Down’s syndrome is wonderful. \nI was sterilised because I was sure I’d never change my mind about wanting more kids. But I was wrong – I was nowhere near done being a mum. Sterilisation: The Facts \n● Female sterilisation is effective in 99% of cases. \n● The operation is performed under general anaesthetic and involves cutting, blocking or sealing the fallopian tubes. \n● It is very difficult to reverse and the NHS is reluctant to offer it to any women under the age of 30. \n● There is no guarantee that you will successfully conceive after reversing sterilisation. \n● According to Net Doctor, in the 1970s around 40,000 women a year were sterilised in the UK. By 2015, that figure had dropped to around 8,000. \n● For more information about Down’s syndrome, visit Futureofdowns.com , an online community offering support for parents and an up-to-date, balanced view of life with the condition.
