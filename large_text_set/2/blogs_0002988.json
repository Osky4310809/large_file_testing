Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool's only acquisition last month looked resplendent in the club’s famous red at the KCOM and drew many admiring looks. \nBut rather than a swanky new coach, they needed more players in January. \nThis fourth defeat in five games hammered home the unwelcome truth for Jurgen Klopp that his squad are not good enough. \nThey’re not good enough to challenge for the title. \nThey’re not good enough to win trophies. Nice new bus, but Liverpool really needed some new players (Photo: Gareth Copley) \nAnd on this display, they’re nowhere near good enough to finish in the top four. \nDespite this, Klopp refused to see last month’s transfer window as a missed opportunity to strengthen his squad and insisted they could not get anyone they wanted. \nLiverpool did consider Julian Draxler, but cooled their interest when Paris St Germain entered the bidding and the Germany forward hiked his personal demands. \nKlopp said: “I cannot change my answer after this, I cannot say ‘yes, it would have been fantastic if the club could have given me [new players]’. \n“We had opportunities for doing something, but we didn’t find the right players. It’s not because we were blind, it’s because the players were not available.

We have to show a reaction, but I will not change my answers about things like this after a game, which I am really not happy about.” \nHull deserve huge credit for their excellent display, but there were so many negatives about Liverpool’s performance that Klopp almost didn’t know where to start. \nSimon Mignolet blundered to present Alfred N’Diaye with a simple tap-in for the opener before Oumar Niasse bagged the second on the break. \nKlopp was distraught by Liverpool’s woeful marking for N’Diaye’s goal and let rip at his players at half-time. The defeat against Hull was their fourth in their last five games (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty) \nFor all the goals they scored before their form fell off a cliff in 2017, they lack a predatory marksman, Daniel Sturridge used to be one, but he is just a shell of the striker he was, while Divock Origi still has too many rough edges. \nKlopp was gutted as he lent against the wall outside the press room at the KCOM and attempted to explain this latest debacle. \nHe looked as despondent as he has ever been during his Anfield reign and he must somehow lift his dispirited players for the visit of Tottenham on Saturday evening. \nThat has not been a problem for Liverpool and it is against the Premier League’s lesser lights that they have tripped up. This loss makes it 14 points dropped against Hull, Burnley, Bournemouth, Swansea and Sunderland. \nAs low as Klopp was on the journey back to Merseyside on the club’s shiny, new coach, he vowed he would wake up yesterday ready to tackle his many problems head on.
