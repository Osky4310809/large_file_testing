It has been learned that the accused, who was absconding, has been nabbed from a hideout in Palakkad. Earlier, three other accused, including the suspected mastermind, moved the Kerala High Court seeking anticipatory bail. Search operations are going on to apprehend other perpetrators in connection with the case, an incident which has sparked nation-wide outrage. \nYesterday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan spoke to her and assured of stern action against the perpetrators. Vijayan called up the actress and promised her all support amid widespread condemnation of the incident and growing calls for immediate action against the culprits, including from the apex south Indian actors’ body. He promised stern action against those responsible for the February 17 incident in which the actress was allegedly harassed inside her car for two hours by her tormentors, who had forced their way into the vehicle, before vanishing in a busy area in Kochi. \nWatch this video \nRuling CPI(M) state Secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also spoke to the actress over phone, an official release said in Thiruvananthapuram. The Chennai-based South Artistes Association (SIAA) expressed shock and urged Vijayan to ensure the culprits were brought to book without any further loss of time. \nPolice said some people have been taken into custody for allegedly helping the suspected mastermind Pulser Suni, who remained at large even three days after the crime which has caused nation-wide outrage and raised questions about the safety of women. \nWatch this video #WATCH Police arrests 4th accused in connection to molestation of actress in Kochi; accused was nabbed from Palakkad #FightThePerverts pic.twitter.com/l8s8AHDJ4w \n— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) February 21, 2017 \nPolice, however, remained tight lipped about reports that two associates of Suni, members of the gang which assaulted the actress, have been picked up from Coimbatore. \nWith police launching a hunt for them, Sunil, commonly known as Pulser Suni, and his two alleged associates Manikandan and V P Vigeesh moved the court, claiming as “wrong” the allegations that they had attempted to kidnap and rape the filmstar. \nThey claimed they have been “falsely implicated” on the basis of confessional statement of Martin, the driver of the actress’ car, who has already been arrested for alleged criminal conspiracy. \nThe anticipatory bail pleas are likely to come up for hearing tomorrow. \nMeanwhile, a group of women activists took out a procession in front of the state Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram to protest incident. \nIn a letter to Vijayan, the SIAA said the incident showed “there is no safety even for a popular woman celebrity” in the country. \n“It is hereby requested that you intervene in the issue without any further delay and speed up the investigation to book the culprits and put them behind bars,” it said. \nSIAA general gecretary and popular actor Vishal Krishna lauded the actress for her “courage” to speak out. \n“Most people would have been embarrassed to speak out if they had undergone such trauma. I laud her courage. Such an incident should not have happened,” he told reporters. \nHe said if a well-known actress could undergo such an experience, “think of the situation of the common people.” \n“We are in complete solidarity with the actress,” he said. \n(With agency inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:48:53.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
