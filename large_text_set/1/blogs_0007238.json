It’s the beating heart of our American idea — our bold experiment in self-government.” \nAs he delivered his speech, the crowd began chanting, “Four more years!” to which Obama said, “I can’t do that.” \nObama went on to insist that “in 10 days the world will witness the hallmark of our democracy. The peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to another.” \nSome boos could be heard from the audience. Obama quickly shut down the interruption before adding that he expects the “smoothest possible transition” adding “just as President Bush did for me.” Also Read: Key and Peele Revive Obama Anger Translator on 'Daily Show' (Video) \nObama noted that the economy is rising as “poverty has fallen,” that the unemployment rate is at a 10-year low and that the “uninsured rate has never been lower.” \nThe outgoing president also took a thinly veiled shot at President-Elect Donald Trump, telling the crowd that “our progress has been uneven” and that “for every two steps forward” sometimes the nation takes “a few steps back.” \nObama also touched on education, better wages, social safety nets and equality. “We can argue about how best to achieve these goals but we can’t be complacent about the goals themselves,” he said. \n“There is a second threat to a democracy,” Obama said, adding that he’s lived “long enough to know that race rations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what folks say.” \n“We’re not where we need to be and all of us have work to do,” he said.

That’s why, for the past eight years, I’ve worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. That’s why we’ve ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. That’s why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans,” he said. \n“Let’s be vigilant but not afraid,” he said. \nObama ended his speech urging for unity: “Our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted. All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions.” \nThe president then gave a shout out to Vice President Joe Biden, his wife, Michelle, as well as his two daughters. “Malia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women, you are smart and you are beautiful, but more importantly, kind and thoughtful and full of passion,” he said. “You wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that I’ve done in my life, I’m most proud to be your dad.” \nObama ended his speech with a promise. \n“My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won’t stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days that remain,” Obama said. “For now, whether you’re young or young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your president — the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago.” \nObama ended his address with the words that first got him elected: \n“Yes We Can. Yes We Did. Yes We Can.” \nPearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder performed before the president’s speech, as well as the Chicago Children’s Choir. \nRead original story Obama Says Goodbye: ‘It Has Been the Honor of My Lifetime’  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T05:29:14.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
