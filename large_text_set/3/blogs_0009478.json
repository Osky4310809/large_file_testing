(Photo: Dakota Sumpter, Auburn University) \nAUBURN, Ala. – As a long day neared its end, two Southeastern Conference softball heavyweights fought through the cold and wind at Jane B. Moore Field with guile and determination. \nIn the end, Auburn was a little tougher, had a little more.No. 2 Auburn No. 12 LSU, trailed 3-2, led 4-3 and finally won it 5-4. The way it happened was at least unusual and maybe bizarre for two teams that played in the Women’s College World Series last season. \nNo. 2 Auburn No. 12 LSU, trailed 3-2, led 4-3 and finally won it 5-4. The way it happened was at least unusual and maybe bizarre for two teams that played in the Women’s College World Series last season. \nAuburn would have won it in the top of the seventh, but an error on normally reliable centerfielder Victoria Draper allowed the tying run to score. Then, in the bottom of the seventh, with two outs and runners on first and second, sophomore first baseman Kendall Veach hit a grounder to third. Shemiah Sanchez ’ throw to first was up the line and into the runner. First baseman Sydney Springfield couldn’t haul it in. \nVeach, who already had two hits, ran and hoped. \n“When I saw it was overthrown, I got hyped,” Veach said. “Whatever works.” \nMeanwhile, Kasey Cooper , who had walked and was on second base, was at full-speed from the time the ball left the bat. She raced home with the winning run as the crowd of 2,003 howled with delight. \nAfter a 5-4 victory Friday and a rainout Saturday, the day had started miserably for Auburn with an 8-0 run-rule loss in six innings. It ended with last season’s national runners-up celebrating winning the season’s first SEC series. \n“We tell them you put the pressure on the other team to make plays,” Auburn coach Clint Myers said. “They have to field it, they have to throw it, they have to catch it.” \nThe visitors from Louisiana didn’t get it done. \nAnd the dogged determination of starting pitcher Kaylee Carlson was rewarded. She went the distance, giving up four runs, three of them earned, on nine hits. She threw 146 pitches, the most in her career. \nCarlson made it clear to pitching coach Corey Myers that she wanted no part of leaving the game. \n“Kaylee is a battler,” Clint Myers said. “She is going to go to war. She could have folded several times today because we let her down, but she didn’t. She got her teammates up and said we’re going to get the next one.” \nAuburn made an uncharacteristic three errors, two coming in the seventh inning. \nShortstop Haley Fagan ’s throwing error allowed the leadoff hitter to reach base. Draper’s misplay allowed the tying run to score. But Carlson was undeterred. \n“It’s always frustrating as a pitcher,” Carlson said. “They are there when I need them. I was just trying to get them back in the dugout so they could get the win, which they did.” \nAuburn scored two runs in the first. A Carlee Wallace single, a walk to Kasey Cooper single off the fence by Haley Fagan loaded the bases. Veach lined a single into left to give Auburn a 2-0 lead. \nAfter LSU took a 3-2 lead in the top of the fifth, Fagan’s two-run double in the bottom of the inning to push it back to 4-3 and set the stage for the wild seventh inning. \nThe top four hitters in Auburn’s batting order were 7-for-13. Wallace had a big day with three hits. Fagan and Veach had two hits apiece. Cooper walked three times and scored three runs. \nCarley Hoover , who relieved starter Allie Walljasper in the fifth, took the loss. \nIn the first game of the day, starting Auburn pitcher Makayla Martin struggled from the start and Auburn’s hitters had no answers for Hoover. \nAuburn managed just three hits. It was the first time Auburn had been shut out by a Southeastern Conference opponent since a 6-0 loss to Alabama on April 17, 2015. \n“Mak only gave up seven hits and six of those were groundballs,” Clint Myers said. “It would be nice to “get her some runs, and we just didn’t do it. I didn’t think she pitched badly. Ashlee made one bad pitch. For a freshman to go in and pitch her first SEC series against LSU, I thought she did very well. \nLSU got to Martin for five runs, four of them earned, on seven hits in four innings. She took the loss to fall to 9-3. Freshman Ashlee Swindle made her debut. She retired LSU in order in the fifth but gave up a three-run homer to Sahvanna Jaquish in the sixth. \nMorgan Podany had two of Auburn’s three hits. Wallace had the other. Hoover walked three and hit one, but Auburn was 0-for-10 with runners on base. \nFagan’s hitting streak ended at 20 games.
