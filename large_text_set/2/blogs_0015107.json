Co-star Prithviraj Sukumaran urges for effective investigation Police says Bhavana’s medical examination has confirmed rape: Report. By Maggie Davis | Updated: February 19, 2017 9:25 AM IST Comments Bhavana It came as a shock when reports of Malayalam actress Bhavana being abducted and molested in her car flashed across online media. As per reports, the two time Kerala State Film Award winner was heading to Kochi from her home in Thrissur. This horrific incident happened on February 17 at around 10.30pm. Bhavana is quite prominent in the south film industry. Actor Prithviraj Sukumaran who was her co-star in the film ‘Swapnakoodu’ has posted a message on Facebook in support of the victim in which he has also urged the authorities for effective investigation. As per latest development, it is reported that the actress was raped inside her Audi car. Apparently, Bhavana’s driver Martin (who was drove the car on February 17) and her ex-driver Sunil Kumar conspired to stage an accident before she was raped, reports TOI. The report further states that Martin has been taken into custody while the former driver with other four fled away. The leading daily quoted a police officer saying, “An FIR has been registered with sections of rape, criminal intimidation, criminal conspiracy and relevant sections of the IT Act.” The officer also mentioned that Bhavana’s medical examination has confirmed rape. Bhavana underwent her medical examination at Kalamassery Medical College. The police officer also revealed on how the incident was connived and how the group of men abused her, reports the daily. Bhavana was heading to Kochi for dubbing when her driver Martin stopped the car at Athani, near Angamaly. The officer was quoted saying, “The actor’s car was hit from behind by a Tempo Traveller when Martin stopped the car, stepped out and got into a so-called altercation. Three men entered the car and started abusing the actor even as Martin started driving the car. The accused also shot a video and clicked pictures of the actor while abusing her for nearly an hour en route. One more accused entered the car. The attackers later left her in the car near Padamugal when Martin got into the car again.” Martin had left the car and entered into the Tempo Traveller which was following Bhavana’s car.

He wrote, “Woke up today morning to the horrifying news that has by now been reported, misreported and sensationalised. As disturbing as it was, I refrained from saying something on what happened to one of the most beautiful girls I know because I knew whatever I or any one among our fraternity say, will only be fodder to click baits and TRP mongering. By now, all that can be said about the security of women in our “matriarchal/matrilineal” God’s own country has already been said. And yes..as a man who has to share the responsibility of a society that bears this shame, I hang my head! But please..the most we can collectively do at this moment..is to respect the guts of this girl. I was supposed to start work with her in a week, and she told me that she’d like not to come back in front of the camera so soon..and so is pulling out of the film. I know this girl..I know how brave she is…if it’s affected her enough to make her stay away from what she loves the most..I can only imagine how harrowing it must have been. Yes..please let us have an effective investigation in place and please let’s bring the bastards to justice asap..but please..let us also not allow anyone..ANYONE..to celebrate someone else’s misfortune. WITH YOU BHAVANA…will look forward to hanging with you as soon as you’re up to it..and yeah..be who you are..and don’t let today dictate the rest of your life. Love always..Prithvi. \nPS: Please spare me the “English Medium” jokes on this one. Thanks.” Kochi city police commissioner M P Dinesh said, “An investigation is on in this regard,” reports TOI. An officer with Ernakulam Rural police was quoted saying, “The duo (Martin and Sunil) made over 40 phone calls to each other on Friday, apart from sending several text messages.”   9:25 AM IST | Updated Date: February 19, 2017 9:25 AM IST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:26:43.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
