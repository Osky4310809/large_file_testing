And while there have been numerous rumblings about a second-generation version, it has yet to materialize in any official capacity.\nBut, as it turns out, Glass isn't completely dead. Sure, for you, me, and all the cool Spectacles-wearing teens, Glass will never be cool (it still looks as dorky today as at did in 2013). But for factory workers, the smart glasses are more practical than tablets.\nSEE ALSO: Google patented a mysterious camera hat\nHeather Erickson, a tractor engine assembler at the farm equipment manufacturer AGCO, is one such factory worker who has found Glass to be quite useful for her job, NPR reports .\nErickson says she uses Glass to bring up photos and videos, and to scan serial numbers for specific parts she's working on. She can even use voice commands to dictate notes for the next shift worker. And if she forgets where a part goes, she can call up an instruction manual and display it through Glass's small prism display without needing to leave her workspace and look at a computer.\nWith Glass, ACGO has seen quality checks increase in speed by 20 percent. The company also uses the wearable to train new workers.\nGlass is \"not only accepted; it's desired.\"\nThe company says it previously used tablets to train and instruct employees on assembly, but since tablets are more susceptible to drops and damage, they moved on to Glass. Now the company's planning to double the number used, from 100 to 200. Peggy Gullick, the company's business process improvement director, says Glass is \"not only accepted; it's desired.\"\nThis should really come as no surprise. Smart glasses with augmented reality applications, whether they're made by Google or not , have always worked better for specific use cases in the enterprise and business sector, where they're more useful for highly technical tasks.\nWhile Google had a grand vision of everyone wearing and using Glass to go about their day to get stuff done , it turns out it's easier to just use your phone. It didn't help that everyone thought you were a Glasshole for wearing a computer on your face.\nAt least on the factory floor, nobody gives a sh*t if you look stupid or not.\nWATCH: Google Glass gives Snapchat Spectacles the reality check it needs and even dictate notes for", "external_links": ["http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/03/18/514299682/google-glass-didnt-disappear-you-can-find-it-on-the-factory-floor", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/rGtIHk2S.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOZY1yR5mpI", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/rGtIHk2S.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-20T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:12:40.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
