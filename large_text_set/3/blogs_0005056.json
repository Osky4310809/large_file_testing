The showrunners reveal that many long-buried secrets come out during the search as well as more children going missing, but that's not all... it also seems Dark has a fantasy twist too. \nThere appears to be three different timelines involved - one in the '50s, one in the '80s, and one in the present day - and the trailer ends with a menacing voice over which says: \"It's not who kidnapped the children... but when.\" \nMissing children? Mysterious secrets? Time travel? Sounds very Stranger Things, doesn't it? \nUnfortunately (for fortunately, depending on how you look at it), the second season of Stranger Things will be on Netflix before we get Dark as it's currently still filming with Netflix aiming for a December 2017 release.
