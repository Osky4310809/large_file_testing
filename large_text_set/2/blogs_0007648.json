King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 22 hours ago 25 \nAs widely reported, Lady Gaga is set to join Metallica onstage for a duet at the Grammy Awards ceremony on February 12 at the Staples Center in LA. \nThe pop superstar was recently asked by Zane Lowe on how the collaboration came to be, revealing it happened quite casually at actor Bradley Cooper's place: \nShe said: \"I was at Bradley's house with Lars and we were just hanging out... \n\"He's amazing. I've gotta tell you something: I went to see them live. I mean, I've seen them a couple of times live, but I saw them live recently, and we were watching the show and I'll tell you something, those guys play better than they've ever played in their whole lives.\"Meanwhile, the performance was also officially confirmed by Metallica with the following statement: \"We promised you something unique for Grammy night... In addition to the honor of ' Hardwired ' being nominated for Best Rock Song, we are absolutely thrilled to confirm that Lady Gaga will be joining us on stage at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards! Be sure to check your local listings and tune in this Sunday on CBS-TV to see this special collaboration.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:34:02.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
