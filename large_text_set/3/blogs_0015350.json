La Salle won in straight sets. CONTRIBUTED PHOTO / ST When defending champion De La Salle lost to University of the Philippines in three sets, 25-22, 25-21, 25-19, in the first round of the UAAP Season 79 women’s volleyball tournament, it ignited an ember within a sleeping giant. More than a month after the humiliating defeat, the Lady Spikers’ fire was unleashed into a napalm blast as La Salle scored a vengeful 27-25, 25-11, 25-17 victory. “When we lost in the first round, we have that intense motivation of beating UP this time around,” said La Salle captain Kim Fajardo. “Whoever you gave the ball to, you could see a fire in their eyes that they will score a kill in this possession.” ADVERTISEMENT The first set seemed to give the Lady Maroons a sense that they can pull off another shocker against the Lady Spikers, but the next two proved that La Salle was on another level. Kim Kianna Dy, La Salle’s talisman, said the win also served as a message to the rest of the league. “It can be said that it was a statement win because we lost in the first round and we don’t want to lose once more in the second round,” said Dy, who had 11 points in the win. “I noticed that we play better after we lose so I think the loss was a blessing because now we were able to avenge that loss.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:41:23.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
