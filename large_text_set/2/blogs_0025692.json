Mariachis wait for gigs, jackets slung over their shoulders, while a few feet away, skaters sit with their feet dangling off the big, concrete stage. A rooster crows in someone's backyard; the sound of hammering emanates from the half-finished development across the street. \nBardo Martinez, lead vocalist of L.A. band Chicano Batman, crossed the street there one evening last December in a blue suit, complete with ruffled shirt, vest and maroon bow tie — the kind of outfit you might wear if you played in the house band at the 1976 Grammys. As he stepped toward the hip bar Eastside Luv, he locked eyes with an older man standing on the front stoop of a nearby house. \n\"The man was just like, looking at me — staring at me for a while,\" Martinez remembers. \"Then he gave me one of these\" — Martinez gives a little salute — \"and I gave him one of these\" — he salutes, too, turning it into a full-arm wave. The connection was instant, and the meaning was unspoken, deep. \"There ?was just so much elation, so much respect reverberating back and forth.\" \nMartinez was in the neighborhood with the rest of Chicano Batman. The quartet have, over the course of almost a decade, become something like the city's own house band — a band that straddles the classic and the new, the nostalgic and the identity shifting. The rest of the band was wearing matching suits, as they always do. \nThey already had been in Boyle Heights for 13 hours that day, filming a commercial that doubled as a video for their funky, bilingual cover of \"This Land Is Your Land.\" The shoot was a moment that felt for the band like a big step forward, a legitimization of years of hard work. \nThe older man's gesture had said, simply: \"I see you.\" \n\"There was no distance between me and him, because we had this understanding of each other that goes beyond class,\" Martinez recalls. \"He saw a brother coming up. Like, 'This cat has the golden ticket.'?\" \nIt was, perhaps, a sign — reassurance that a band, whose music distills this sprawling city's cultural heritage, could step forward without leaving behind the only place that could have birthed them. \nFreedom Is Free , the band's new album, is that step forward. It's their clearest statement, a record that revolves around the soul sound they've refined over the years but that doesn't sacrifice ambitious adventures into Afrobeat, Brazilian pop, baroque psychedelia and the band's first firm venture into political territory. It's a song cycle about maintaining inner strength, radiating love and standing up to the distorting forces of social and political power. It finds the band growing fully into their sound, and harnessing it to make a statement for disorienting times. \nChicano Batman started eight years ago, when it was little more than the name of the Myspace page on which Martinez posted home recordings of songs he'd written in college. The name was meant to juxtapose two kinds of iconography — the revolutionary and the pop, the profound and the pulp. \nIt was around the same time, while Martinez was studying at UCLA, that bassist Eduardo Arenas heard him singing Brazilian songwriter-guitarist Caetano Veloso's \"Nine Out of Ten\" at a party. \"He was like, 'Damn, you know that?'?\" Martinez recalls. They decided to start a band. \nLater on, drummer Gabriel Villa and guitarist Carlos Arévalo jumped on board. (Other than Villa, who hails from Colombia, the band is from SoCal; Martinez is from La Mirada, Arévalo is from East L.A., and Arenas is from the Inland Empire.) Together, they developed a sound that centered on soul — anchored by Villa and Arenas' air-tight rhythms, lifted by Arévalo's springy, light-footed guitar and Martinez's classic croon — but followed their whims into all kinds of territory. \"Left-field, B-side reissues\" is how Martinez describes the band's sound.

Those opportunities led them, in 2016, to make the record they had always wanted to make. \nRecorded in New York with producer Leon Michels, Freedom Is Free is the first Chicano Batman album to be made outside Arenas' home studio, and the first that took them longer than two days to record. \"We'd wake up at our Airbnb, go get some breakfast, and go live another song,\" Arenas says. \"For me, it's bass — I wake up and I'm walking on the train, walking wherever, feeling the pulse of my walk to the studio.\" Chicano Batman's Freeddom is Free COurtesy of Chicano Batman \nFor this interview, the four sit in a semicircle near the front door of instrument shop Future Music in Highland Park. The band is a self-contained, democratic institution — all in their early- to mid-30s, they're thoughtful and positive, though they don't always agree. Martinez is a free-flowing, inspired fountain of words; Arenas is soft-spoken, intellectual; Arévalo minds the dates and details. (Villa is the silent type.) \nTheir records have always been stylistically far-ranging, but Freedom Is Free particularly succeeds at tracing the band's eclectic interests without losing its center of gravity. One track, \"Angel Child,\" with its sudden time changes and maze-like runs, nods to the symphonic psychedelia of the late David Axelrod; another, \"Right Off the Back,\" is a finely detailed, snaking instrumental. \n\"What's so cool about Chicano Batman is they are a band in the classic sense,\" says Michels, who, in addition to producing such bands as The Arcs, is also a saxophonist known for his work with the Dap-Kings and his own band, El Michels Affair. \"They rehearse every week, and they fight over the arrangements.\" It was Michels' job to keep the album centered on that sound while helping the band sharpen their tangents.
