Image copyright Daniel Raven-Ellison Image copyright Daniel Raven-Ellison \nA moment when his stress, excitement, focus and engagement levels peaked while walking across Cardiff was not down to its beauty but rather his need just at that moment to go to the toilet. \nClimbing hills in the Lake District created stress, as did crossing busy dual carriageways, but the machine does not differentiate between experiences that are pleasurable and those that are not. \nAlthough the monitor helped him become more aware of his surroundings, he said: \"What's interesting is that for about half my walk across cities I'm not focused and I'm not actually in tune with my emotions.\" \nHowever, the monitor did pick up on key times when his stress levels altered in line with his environment. \nHis trip across Cardiff started well, with low levels of stress as he began his walk in woodland, although he came across the more familiar sight of a pile of rubbish. \nIndeed, fly-tipping was a recurring blight that seemed to prompt a rise in his stress levels. Image copyright Daniel Raven-Ellison \nSimilarly each time he encountered a road, his stress and focus levels increased, whereas by contrast water had an immediate calming effect on him. \nAs he continued his walks, he often found himself alone although many cities could be crossed in around an hour or less. \nIn Aberdeen, its appeal was that much of his route followed an old railway line. \n\"It's full of interest and completely functional. Aberdeen as a walk just worked,\" he says. \nOut of all the cities he visited, Swansea was one of his favourites to walk through as he described it as \"surprisingly green with a ribbon of woodland\". \nIndeed, he was surprised by how green many cities are. Image caption Swansea's green spaces were a surprise to Daniel Image caption Sheffield was similarly mapped for its greenery \nElsewhere he found Newcastle to be the \"best city for seeing children playing out in the wild\" while in Wolverhampton he loved \"Dudley with its hills and great views across the city\". \nIf there was anything he could change immediately having travelled through so many cities on foot, he said: \"I would speak to people about not putting dog poo in bags and adorning trees at head height for other people to pick up, it's all over the country and it's a shameful problem we need to deal with.\" \nMost of his journeys began with either a rail or bus journey to the outskirts of a city. \nAccommodation was often a tent or a B&B and given he is a vegan, he made more than a few visits to curry houses. To avoid blisters he put a plaster on the problem area before the walk. \nFor the most part the weather was good and perfect for his walks. \n\"I did have to protect my headset from the elements though, so always carried a sturdy umbrella with me,\" he said. \nHis walk, which began in June last year with a walk across St David's in Wales, ended in December in Birmingham. \nAlong with 69 cities, he also visited 15 national parks to compare urban and rural environments. \nHaving completed his trips, he said: \"If lots of people were wearing these monitors it could inform how we build cities to make them less stressful and more interesting to walk.\" \nNow he will upload the data to begin to build an \"emotional\" map of Britain and hopes others will follow. \n\"I'm going to be using the five million points of geolocated data to see how my emotions changed across different kinds of places. \n\"My plan is to release all of the data as open data, so that anyone can interpret it and present it in interesting ways.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T08:10:21.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
