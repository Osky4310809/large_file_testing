Maybe something's going to happen,\" Thomson said. \nAfter several days of slow progress north in light winds, Le Cleac'h and Thomson are now heading towards the finish with speeds having dropped from 30 knots to a little over 20. \nThomson, who is competing in the Vendee Globe for the fourth time and is aiming to become the first Briton to win the it, currently has a speed advantage over his rival. \nThe race is estimated to finish on 19 January at Les Sables d'Olonne, France. \n\"We have 17 to 20 knots of breeze at the moment and not very nice seas to be honest with the waves coming in from the east,\" Thomson said . \n\"It's difficult to go fast but I'm not complaining because I am making good speed. It's going to get windy in the next 24 hours, up to 30 knots. We'll be going fast, and we'll have to see how things pan out.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Alex Thomson: Sailor 'going strong' in the Vendee Globe \nThomson had led the race for much of the early stages and broke two race records prior to being overtaken, as he reached the Cape of Good Hope in record time, but Le Cleac'h stole the lead in early December and has not relinquished his hold on the race ahead of the sprint finish. \nThomson was nearly 1,000 miles behind Le Cleac'h at Christmas after his boat's hydrofoil was ripped off in mid-November, but has increased his speed since rounding Cape Horn.
