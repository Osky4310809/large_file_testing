The entire team thanks Rhianna for her dedication and tireless efforts on the games.” \n“So, I’m packing up my climbing axe plus a little venison jerky for the road, and bidding a fond farewell to Lara. Onwards to new adventures!” Pratchett wrote on Twitter . “I want to thank the Crystal Dynamics team for their dedication especially Josh Stafford, Cameron Suey, and Noah Hughes. Guys, it’s been emotional. But, I like to think we did some good things. Maybe shifted the gaming landscape a wee bit. And that feels damn good. I also want to thank TR’s terrific fan community. You really are the best in the world. Constantly helping me remember why I do this job.” \nPratchett was awarded the “Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing” at the 68th Writers Guild of America Awards for Rise of the Tomb Raider , in addition to the “Outstanding Achievement in Character” at the D.I.C.E. Awards 2016. She was also nominated for the Best Videogame Script for 2013’s Tomb Raider by the Writer’s Guild of Great Britain. She also wrote several tie-in Tomb Raider comics for Dark Horse that bridged the gap between the two games. \nHer other video game work includes Mirror’s Edge , 2008’s Prince of Persia , BioShock Infinite , and 2014’s Thief . \nA third game in the new rebooted series hasn’t been officially revealed yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:57:52.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
