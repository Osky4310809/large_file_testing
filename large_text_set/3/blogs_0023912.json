Andrelton Simmons singled to lead off the game. Xander Bogaerts was then hit by a pitch. The Dutch were in business. \nYadier Molina apparently had seen enough. Puerto Rico’s catcher caught Simmons leaning too far away from second and picked him off. Bogaerts took second on the play, then advanced to third when Jurickson Profar singled to right. Eddie Rosario threw a laser to the plate to keep Bogaerts at third, and while Profar was busy celebrating advancing a runner 90 feet, Molina did this: \n— WBC Baseball (@WBCBaseball) March 21, 2017 \nThe best part is how long Molina waits to actually fire the ball to first, seemingly in disbelief that this opportunity has presented itself. Add it to the list of flashy defensive plays from the WBC. \nSo that’s two outs on the bases for Netherlands to start the game in one full dose of Yadi wrath. Adding a little salt to the wound for the Dutch, the next batter up, Wladimir Balentien, homered to center. Oh, what could’ve been with a couple more runners in play. \nTo be fair, it was a solid single. Can’t blame Profar for being psyched. Just maybe stand on the bag next time while you gesture to your bench to get pumped. \nThe winner will face the winner of Tuesday’s second semifinal between Team USA and Japan in Wednesday’s championship game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:51:09.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
