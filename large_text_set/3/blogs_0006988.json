The strike called for women across the country to not engage in any work to show their economic and social power and spotlight gender inequality.\nCritics of the strike said it was meant to protest President Donald Trump. Organizers of the strike were the same groups and individuals that created the Women's March on Washington in January, which protested Trump's inauguration.\nOf the Women's March's 544 partners, 100 groups received money from Soros between 2000 and 2014 that totaled $246,637,217, according to the Media Research Center. Planned Parenthood and the Center for American Progress were among the groups that received funding.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch received the most funding from Soros–$37 million and $32 million, respectively, the report stated. A \" premier partner \" of the Women's March, Planned Parenthood, raked in $21 million.\n\"Those donations represent just a fragment of Soros' massive global influence,\" the Media Research Center said in its report. \"His Open Society Foundations have given away more than $13 billion to push his globalist, anti-American views.\"\nThe post Report: George Soros Gave $246 Million to Groups Behind ‘Day Without a Woman’ Protest appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T19:03:34.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
