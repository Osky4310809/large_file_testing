And no, it's not because Snapchat had them first.\nInstead, the company is taking two features straight out of Slack's playbook with the addition emoji-laden reactions and mentions.\nSEE ALSO: This guy spent 8 years making an emoji snake, and it was totally worth it\nReactions, which were first spotted in a \"small test\" earlier in the month, allow you to respond to individual messages within a thread with seven different emoji. Messenger's reactions differ slightly from those seen elsewhere on Facebook.\nIncluded in that group is a \"thumbs down\" emoji, which is probably the closest we'll ever get to an actual \"dislike\" button on Facebook. (The social network says the thumbs down represents a \"no\" reaction.)\nAdding a reaction inside a conversation in Messenger works just like reactions in News Feed: hold down on a message to select a response. If you're in a group chat and there are multiple reactions on a single message, they will all appear.\nAdding a reaction to a message will also trigger a notification to the person who sent the original message, so get ready for a lot more push notifications if you're using reactions in a group thread with a lot of participants.\nSpeaking of new push notifications, Facebook is also adding Slack-like @-mentions, so you can \"call out\" specific people in a chat. When you use mentions in Messenger, the person who you mentioned will get a different type of push notification letting them know (thankfully, Facebook is letting you disable these.)\nLike Slack, all you have to do to mention someone is begin a reply with @ and then add their name. Others in the conversation will also be able to see the mention and receive notifications as they normally would in a chat.\nIn addition to Messenger, Facebook is also bringing the new features to its own Slack competitor, Work Chat, the messaging tool inside Work Place, the social network's business communication tool.\nBoth mentions and reactions are launching now, with a full rollout expected to be finished in the next couple days, the company says.\nWATCH: Someone invented a desktop robot thatâ€™s perfect for DIY techies", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dLJNirsMvmA8p6Ge0GwRnuICq_4=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423605%2F0c71d891-7642-4e04-af54-bed8bcf56cf7.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KLngPMFsrhiazf03DfzHyKgwzu8=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423605%2F0c71d891-7642-4e04-af54-bed8bcf56cf7.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fSpyKVSBFlQqN7x3Y_R7bmT4Yg4=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423616%2F7d03ab83-d0a7-4d90-9a8a-ce89cd8ee4d0.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/QSFSIHwk.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/QSFSIHwk.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/WCy6O5_F7h5CHKTDmCh0cNEX3cg=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423616%2F7d03ab83-d0a7-4d90-9a8a-ce89cd8ee4d0.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-23T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:37:13.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
