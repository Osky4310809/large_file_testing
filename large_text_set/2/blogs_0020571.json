The museum’s closure will cost six full-time jobs and 19 part-time positions.\nAs of press time, the petition has 11,264 of a required 15,000 signatures. A Whovian myself (Allons-y!), I contributed my name to the growing list. Since I moved to Edinburgh three years ago and discovered the Doctor Who mecca, I’ve been anxious to visit the Welsh capital, where the long-running show (and spin-off Torchwood ) regularly film . \n“Let’s face it,” Ferriday said. “In these dark post-Brexit days, we all need some escapism. \nBBC Worldwide did not immediately respond to Geek’s request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:47:26.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
