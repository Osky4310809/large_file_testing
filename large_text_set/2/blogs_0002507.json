The crowd appeared to number in the hundreds.\nYiannopoulos, whose account on Twitter was suspended last year after he was accused of participating in the online harassment of an African-American actress, in a statement on Facebook said he was \"evacuated\" from the campus and criticized \"the Left\" saying it was \"absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down.\" (Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Sandra Maler and Nick Macfie)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:53:27.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
