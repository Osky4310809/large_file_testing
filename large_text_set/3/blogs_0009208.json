Posted 3 hours ago 10 \nEverything you need to know about the story behind the song, amp and pedal settings as well as used guitar techniques. \nWell then, if you like AiC so much we'll give it to you. We considered 5 of their songs to make a guide about, but in the end, 'Nutshell' came out on top. \nEnjoy, heavymetal68 , this one's for you! \nAlice in Chains \"Nutshell\" \nWriters: Layne Staley, Jerry Cantrell, Mike Inez, Sean Kinney Producers: Alice in Chains, Toby Wright Album: Jar of Flies (EP) (UG Score 9.5) Recorded: 1993 Genre: Alternative rock, acoustic rock, grunge Length: 4:19 Story behind the song \nIt is one of Alice in Chains' best-known songs. The song is well-known for its emotional acoustic instrumentation and electric guitar solo, as well as dark lyrics about loneliness, despair, and death. The lyrics are also considered to be an expression of Staley's frustration with a lack of privacy. It is considered to be an essential example of 1990s alternative rock despite not hitting a single U.S. Billboard chart or any charts around the world. \nIt's also likely that this song is about going through life's path: \"We face the path of time,\" and believing things that aren't true at some point in our lives: \"We chase misprinted lies.\" It is also said that at one point or another, you could wind up without any friends: \"And yet I fight, and yet I fight this battle all alone. No one to cry to, no place to call home.\" You will have to do some things in life without any guidance. \n\"Nutshell\" took on a new meaning after the singer Layne Staley died tragically in 2002. When you listen to this song today, it's difficult not to think about his death, and lines like \"I'd feel better dead\" are positively chilling. This ballad was never a single and it sounds unlike their popular works from this period, but it touched a nerve with fans and remains one of their most famous tunes. Alice in Chains play it at most every show, and it's a great tribute to the spirit and resolve of Staley. This song became a kind of anthem for people fighting drugs addiction. Music Videos \nLyrics video version. Live version \n\"Nutshell\" is also known for having opened the band's performance on \"MTV Unplugged\" in 1996. This rendition of the song was included on the compilation album \" Music Bank \" (1999) (UG Score 9.6), as well as \"The Essential Alice in Chains\" (2006). \nAlso, this MTV show marked Alice in Chains' first appearance as a five-piece band, adding second guitarist Scott Olson. \nMike Inez wrote in marker \"Friends don't let friends get friends haircuts\" on his acoustic bass. This was a stab at Metallica for selling out and cutting their hair.
