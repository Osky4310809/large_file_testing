Robart is a Bush-appointed district judge for the Western District of Washington state. The Trump administration has vowed to file a stay on his Robart’s ruling and get the higher courts, possibly the Supreme Court to deliver a final ruling. Yet, as lawfare erupted over Trump’s order, he also lost his nominee for the Secretary of the Army. Billionaire Vincent Viola withdrew his name from consideration over not being able to completely sever his business ties (via Bloomberg ): Vincent Viola, the billionaire founder of trading firm Virtu Financial Inc., has withdrawn his nomination to be Secretary of the Army after distancing himself from his business ties proved too difficult, according to two Trump administration officials and a third person familiar with Viola’s decision.\nViola informed President Donald Trump Friday that he will be unable to accept the nomination because separating from the organizations that he has built over the last 35 years have proven insurmountable, said two of the people familiar with Viola’s decision, who asked not to be named. \nThe full extent of Viola’s financial holdings and ownership stakes in other companies would’ve been detailed in ethics and financial disclosure forms to be filed as the nomination process unfolded. Without them, it’s difficult to know what business arrangements tripped him up. This is the first Trump nominee to withdraw from consideration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T13:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:28:11.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
