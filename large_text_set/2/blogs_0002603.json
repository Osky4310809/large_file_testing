The two committees deal with many of the nation’s most sensitive issues and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism. \nThey also worked for members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. \nHere’s a picture of brother Imran Awan with former President Bill Clinton. \nThe brothers are suspected of accessing the accounts as well as stealing equipment from Congress. \nAccording to the Blaze: \nJamal worked for Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), a member of both the intelligence and foreign affairs panels and Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) who is on the Committee on Homeland Security. \nImran did work for Reps. Andre Carson (D-Ind.) and Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), both of whom serve as members of the intelligence committee, while Abid worked for then-Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a member of House committees on oversight, armed services and Benghazi, and Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.), a member of the foreign affairs committee. \nRep. Debbie Wassermann Schultz (D-Fla), who was already compromised in the DNC hack, may also have been compromised. \nThe investigations are ongoing and at least one brother had a criminal record. \nAll the brothers were making in excess of $160,000 in their positions. \nUnbelievable that this could happen, yet again to Democrats. \nWhere is the security?
