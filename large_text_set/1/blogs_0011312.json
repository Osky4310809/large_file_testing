The playing experience offered by this game is very similar to Candy Crush, in that it substitutes candies and sweets for fruit and farm products. Gameplay is also practically identical: combine fruit of the same type on a gridded game board so that they disappear. As you do this, you will advance along a map made up of more than 100 levels full of strawberries, carrots, apples, and other typical farm goods. You'll have access to all kinds of different social interactions in Farm Heroes Saga, like competing against your Facebook friends to see who can rack up the most points. You can also send requests for your friends to give you extra lives, or choose to share your 'boosters' and power-ups with them. Farm Heroes Saga is a good puzzle game with colorful graphics. The best part of the game, like with all King.com titles, is the large community of players taking part. Thanks to this, you'll always find friends to share your games with.
