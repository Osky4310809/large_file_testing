He went on loan to the San Siro at the beginning of this year and has netted one goal and provided three assists for Milan in nine Serie A appearances, per WhoScored.com . Per football analyst Thom Lawrence, the Barca youth graduate is comparing favourably with the best attackers the Italian top flight has to offer: Thom Lawrence @deepxg Gerard Deulofeu currently assisting the highest xG per 90 in Serie A, just ahead of the mighty Salah. https://t.co/aMzLcdYEql 3/19/2017, 8:24:46 PM He has only just turned 23, so he has a plenty more scope for improvement. If he continues to show such excellent form to the end of the season, it would be little surprise if Barca were to gamble on buying him back. Deulofeu's move to Milan has been, so far, a huge success. Before he left Everton in January, he had made just four starts in the Premier League in 2016-17, netting no goals and providing no assists. His prospects of earning a recall to the Spain squad looked minimal, but he has impressed national team coach Julen Lopetegui with his performances in Italy, per Reuters (via MailOnline ): \" He was not playing consistently at his previous team, but since joining Milan, he has taken on an important role, is at a good level and has improved with the things that we felt he had to improve on. He can help us and we like him.\" Deulofeu has the ability to play on either flank, or even through the middle if needs be. He could provide fine attacking cover at Barca should he continue to prove his ability at the highest level, and there are likely to be a number of other suitors for him in the summer even if the Camp Nou outfit forego the chance to buy him back.
