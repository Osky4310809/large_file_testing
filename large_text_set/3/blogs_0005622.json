How do you cut out a $6 latte habit when you've never even set foot inside a Starbucks? \nWhen you can't easily change your bottom line, you need to change your mindset instead. Here, we tackle three more common ways that Americans are blowing their paychecks, and offer up cost-saving alternatives that don't feel like a sacrifice. \nInstead of a Night Out at a Restaurant, Try... Making Something Special Out of Dinner at Home \nI know, you eat dinner at home all the time, but the next time date night rolls around, consider turning your dining room into a cozier version of your city's best eatery. Dress up to the nines and pick up a nice bottle of wine—you can splurge a little bit without guilt since it's still likely way less than you'd pay for a bottle served at a restaurant. \nInstead of Shopping for a New Wardrobe, Try... Hosting a Clothes Swap with Friends \n\"New\" and \"new to you\" feel mostly the same. Ask a big group of friends to come together one weekend to trade clean, gently-worn threads and shoes. And you should encourage them to invite their friends. The more the merrier—and the better chance of finding pieces that fit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T14:15:03.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
