I just thought, ‘Oh. Oh.'” \n“It’s clear that you don’t need government experience to be elected president of the United States,” Rubenstein responded. \n“That’s what I thought,” she added. “I thought, ‘Oh gee, I don’t have the experience. I don’t know enough. But now I’m thinking, ‘Oh.'”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:00:47.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
