Regardless of what concepts were kicked around among staffers at the Department of Homeland Security, the White House had no interest in the plan of action outlined in the memo, said White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. \n“There is no effort at all to round up, to utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants,” Spicer said. “That is 100 percent not true. It is false. It is irresponsible to be saying this.”   Hannity: Americans Can’t Afford The Cost And Crime Of Illegal Immigration \nAlthough Spicer said he could not say the approach outlined in the memo was never considered, he was emphatic it is not an active concept. \n“I don’t know what could potentially be out there, but I know that there is no effort to do what is potentially suggested,” he said. \nTo prove the memo does exist, the Associated Press posted the document dated Jan. 25, online. The memo notes the federal government would seek to partner with “willing” states in using National Guard members for immigration-related duties.   \nThe story gained credence early Friday as Democrats lined up to denounce it before anyone in the White House ever said the concept was even operational. \nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. called the proposal that did not happen “one of the most un-American things that would happen in the last century.” \n“To use a military force to break up families is unconscionable,” tweeted Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:54:25.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
