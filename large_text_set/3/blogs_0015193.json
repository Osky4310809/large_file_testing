The patients in various government-run hospitals faced the brunt as the doctors did not report to work.

Image courtesy: Twitter/@ANI_news \nAt most of the hospitals, some senior resident doctors looked after the daily health check-ups of the patients, an official of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (Mard) said. \nThe emergency services were, however, not affected due to the doctors' protest, he added. \nThe doctors did not report to work to protest the two recent incidents — one in Dhule and another at the Sion hospital in Mumbai — where relatives of patients attacked the respective doctors-in-charge. \n\"There are a couple of long-pending demands from the state government, including higher wages and more security at the government hospitals,\" a senior Mard official said on condition of anonymity. \n\"Both the demands have not been addressed to our satisfaction. Hence, we get attacked frequently and the state authorities fail to address the issue,\" he added. \nThe Mard had earlier assured the Bombay High Court that it would not give a call or go on a strike and would only hold peaceful demonstrations highlighting their grievances. \nState Medical Education Minister Girish Mahajan said, \"We are holding negotiations with the Mard members. There has been a substantial financial allocation in the state budget for infrastructure development.\" \n\"We are keen on increasing the number of doctors (in government hospitals) as well and have taken steps towards it. We need some time so that the changes can be felt.\" \nMeanwhile, social activist Afak Mandaviya on Monday approached the Bombay High Court seeking a direction to the resident doctors across the state to call off their protest and report to work immediately. \nThe petition also sought a direction to the state government to look into the issue and take necessary action. The petition is likely to be taken up for hearing by a division bench on Tuesday. \nMandaviya had earlier filed a public interest litigation highlighting the issue of doctors frequently going on strikes, causing inconvenience to the people. \n\"During the hearings on the PIL, the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors had assured the court that henceforth, it would not give a call or go on a strike anywhere in the state and would only hold peaceful demonstrations highlighting their grievances which included attacks on doctors by relatives,\" Mandaviya's lawyer Datta Mane said. \nHe contended that by refusing to report to work, the doctors were committing contempt of court. \nMane said the state government had assured the High Court earlier that it would provide police security at the state and civic-run hospitals to avoid such attacks on doctors. \n\"The government will have to inform the High Court what steps it proposes to take now,\" he added. Meanwhile, Mumbai Mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar appealed the doctors to resume the duties. \n\"I have appealed the doctors to resume their duties as most of their demands have been met by the civic administration while thousands of patients have been left in the lurch at present,\" Mahadeshwar told PTI . \n\"The civic administration was doing everything to ensure doctors' safety and therefore doctors must cancel their leave in the larger interest of society,\" said Mahadeshwar, adding if the resident doctors didn't resume duty, then the law will take its own course. \n\"We have accepted their two demands immediately — allowing only two relatives of a patient to go inside, and setting up alarm bell system. However, their third demand of setting up vigilance committee needs some time to fulfill,\" he said. \nThe newly-elected mayor also said that the corporation was going to hire 700 guards for security at hospitals. \nMunicipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta held a review meeting on strengthening security at hospitals. It was decided, among other things, that relatives of patients would need entry pass to enter the hospitals, BMC said in a statement. A case would be registered if anyone tries to enter the hospital without entry pass, it said. \n  08:08   08:16 am Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:56:39.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
