John Lewis (D-GA) is boycotting Trump’s inauguration, and if it’s somehow a big deal that Trump hit back at him like everybody knew he would, then the following item seems relevant. \nFrom Kevin Merida at WaPo on Jan. 21, 2001 , here’s a look back at the Congressional Dems who hated George Bush and couldn’t believe he was about to be inaugurated: \n“It’s kind of gloomy,” says Rep. John Conyers, the Michigan Democrat who is dean of the Congressional Black Caucus. He boards the Capitol’s underground subway en route to the swearing-in, then pulls a black ribbon from his suit pocket. “I’ve got a little pin to put on.” It’s a CBC protest pin. There’s a small piece of paper attached: This ribbon represents the fact that the will of the people was not honored in the 2000 presidential election. That’s how John Conyers feels about George W. Bush’s big moment. “But we’ve got to keep on fighting,” he adds. \nSome members of the Black Caucus decided to boycott Inauguration Day; John Lewis, for instance, spent the day in his Atlanta district. He thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in because he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president. \nWhich is the exact same reason he’s giving this time. \nWhat’s that? We’re supposed to talk about what John Lewis did 50 years ago, but not what he did 16 years ago? Too bad. \nThe next time somebody tells you that this situation is unprecedented, that this time it’s different, just show them that. If things are different this time, it’s not for that reason. John Lewis just can’t stand to lose an election. And he thinks he has a lifetime pass to do and say whatever he wants, because that’s how the media treats him. You can either agree with him or shut up, if you don’t want to be called a racist. \nHappy MLK Day!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:18:04.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
