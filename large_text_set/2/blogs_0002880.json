So the quarterback made a point of hitting arms during a leg day with strength coach Eric Mahanke—because you don’t pass for 3,937 yards in a regular season, as Carr did, without a cannon attached to your shoulder. In the Twitter clip below, Carr and Mahanke start with hip thrusts, which are useful for glute strength, but resemble the sort of carnal motion better suited for the bedroom. So the jokester quarterback starts hitting his triceps in the background until Mahanke scolds him back into form. \nCarr’s resentment for leg day continues at the free weights rack, where he starts ripping curls when Mahanke had instructed him to do rows. Time for inline chops? Nah. The gridiron gunslinger does tricep pushdowns in the background instead. And while we don’t necessarily believe an elite athlete such as Carr neglects legs and core in his workout routine, Carr’s defiance of leg day is an act of solidarity for anyone who’s ever walked into the gym, looked at the squat rack, and said “Nah, my biceps could be bigger anyway.” Plus, notice the MVP candidate’s walking boot, which he earned because of a broken fibula in a December meeting with the Indianapolis Colts. It just goes to show: When life gives you lemons, skip leg day.
