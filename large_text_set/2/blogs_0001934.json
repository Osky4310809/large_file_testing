Crystal Palace created more space between themselves and the relegation zone with a deserved 2-0 win over Bournemouth. Sam Allardyce has no gripes with his team's showing against Bournemouth, and blasts the January transfer window. \nLiverpool's out-of-favour defender Mamadou Sakho has agreed to move to Crystal Palace on loan for the rest of the season. \nSakho, 26, has only featured for Liverpool's under-23 side this season, having been frozen out of Jurgen Klopp's plans for numerous disciplinary issues. \nA source told ESPN FC earlier this month that Liverpool were demanding £20 million for Sakho , who last played for the first team on April 20, 2016, but eventually agreed to a loan move whereby Palace reportedly paid a £2m fee with the London club paying the Frenchman's full wages.
