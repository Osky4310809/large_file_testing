However, the classic factor about the award show is the red carpet. The Oscars is an occasion when Hollywood celebrities like to flaunt the best, and designers scamper to get actors to don their creations. Sparkling jewels, stunning gowns, perfect hairdos and makeup, fashionistas have a field day checking out who wore what to the party. Black, red, metallic and shades of nude and champagne characterized the red carpet this year. From Emma Stone’s classy golden girl look to Hailee Steinfeld’s floral Ralph Russo, here is a look at the Best Dressed Actresses… \nEmma Stone The actress took home the Best Actress trophy for La La Land and made sure she sparkled on the gala night. Emma wore a gold gown embellished with Swarovski crystals from Givenchy Haute Couture. She teamed it with bronze satin sandals and clutch. The Riccardo Tisci gown had crystal fringes. \nTaraji P Henson All the actresses from Hidden Figures scored on the red carpet. Taraji P Henson wore a blue velvet gown from Alberta Ferretti that did full justice to her curvaceous figure. A Nirav Modi necklace and emerald ring and Jimmy Choo stilettos and clutch finished off the look.

Naomie Harris wore Calvin Klein By Appointment designed by Raf Simons. This was the designer debut on the Hollywood red carpet and a totally smashing one. Mustard heels added a dash of colour to that chic dress.
