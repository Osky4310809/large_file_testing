The average show on the tour drew a crowd of 19,793 fans who paid an average ticket price of $112.08. In total, there were 752,141 tickets sold. \nThe numbers would’ve been higher if not for an ankle injury that sidelined Drake from the last six shows of the tour. \nDespite breaking the all-time record for Hip Hop, Drizzy just missed cracking the Top 10 out of all genres for 2016, coming in at #11. Beyoncé came in at #2 for 2016 by grossing $256.2 million with her Formation Tour’s 49 shows, while Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band took the top spot with a tour that grossed $268.3 million over 76 shows. \nKanye West’s Saint Pablo Tour was the second-highest grossing Hip Hop tour of 2016, pulling in $52.8 million over 41 shows to land at the 29 spot. \nKanye had previously held the record with Jay Z for their Watch The Throne Tour over 2011 and 2012. \nDrake’s now prepping to head back on road for his European tour , which kicks off in Amsterdam on January 21 and ends in Cologne on March 16. \nDrake’s promoted the upcoming tour by saying “special guests” will be announced, although Young Thug has strongly hinted at his own inclusion on Instagram.
