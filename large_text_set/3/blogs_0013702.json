The west London side have enjoyed a recent good spell of form winning five from their last seven Championship games. \nAnd clearly happy with his side's win, Fernandes wanted to phone up Holloway and congratulate the 54-year-old. \nBut it just so happens The Hoops gaffer was midway through an interview when his phone buzzed. Holloway answers the call (Photo: @QPRFC/Twitter) \n\"Tony, can I ring you back,\" said Holloway. \"I'm just doing an interview, mate - you've ruined it. I'm fined now. \n\"I'm fined. I'm fined. Alright mate, I'll ring you back. Thanks.\" \nIt appears that the club rule for phones going off during interviews has been triggered by Holloway's very own boss. (Photo: @QPRFC/Twitter) \nBut thankfully for Holloway, Fernandes took to Instagram saying he would happily pay the fine: \"Classic. So happy after our win 5 1. Called Ian. He was in an interview . Got fined hahahahhahaha. \n\"Looks like I have to pay the fine. It's moments like this I love being Co Chairman of QPR. Ian passion is why I got involved in football in the first place.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:07:55.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
