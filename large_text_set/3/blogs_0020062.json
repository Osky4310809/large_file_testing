Left: Android O on a Pixel. Right: Android N 7.1.2 on a Nexus 5X. \nSo far, we've seen the change with Android O running on a Pixel phone, but we haven't yet verified that it happens with the Pixel Launcher when it's installed on Nexus phones running O as well. This might be a small tweak that will only affect Pixel devices, so do let us know if you see it happening on your Nexus phone.
