By Tracie Mauriello / Post-Gazette Washington Bureau \nWASHINGTON — More than 400 people are gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court ahead of the planned appearance of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey and other Democratic leaders to discuss President Donald Trump’s immigration ban. \nThe event was scheduled as a press conference, but has turned into an impromptu rally, with chants of “No ban! No wall” and “No hate, no fear! Immigrants are welcome here!” The crowd has been growing steadily in advance of the planned 6 p.m. event. \nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order banning immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries on Friday. It has sparked confusion at airports and worldwide protests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:15:28.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
