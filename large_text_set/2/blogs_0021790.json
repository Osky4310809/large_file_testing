Primark, a discount clothing chain, had been selling a novelty shirt from The Walking Dead . The shirt pictured Negan's bat, Lucille, and the words \"Eeny meeny miny moe\". \nA man claimed that the shirt was racist and offensive, and it caused the chain to immediately remove the shirt from all of its stores. \nAccording to the man, \"The slogan is 'Eeeny meenie miny moe…..' It stops there, but of course we all know what the original said: 'catch a n by his toe.'\" He continued, \"The graphic has a large American baseball bat, wrapped round with barbed wire, and covered with blood. This image relates directly to the practice of assaulting black people in America. \"It is directly threatening of a racist assault, and if I were black and were faced by a wearer I would know just where I stood.\" \nOf course, on the show, those weren't the words used by Negan. He finished the children's rhyme with a much more popular version; \"catch a tiger by his toe.\" \nJeffrey Dean Morgan , who portrays Negan on The Walking Dead , had some harsh words to say about this claim. \nHoly crap people are stupid.
