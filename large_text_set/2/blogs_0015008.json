Gaidam I will not handover Yobe to selfish, absentee politicians – Gov. Gaidam On 3:19 pm In News by Tony Comments \nGov. Ibrahim Gaidam of Yobe says the state will not be turned over to reckless and selfish politicians at the expiration of his tenure. \nGaidam stated this in Damaturu at the inauguration of 17 elected local government council chairmen in the state. \n“We will ensure that only committed politicians, with the love of the state at heart take over from us and not drunkards, Indian hemp smokers or gamblers who would mortgage the future of Yobe state. \n“It is evident from your support to the ruling party that you are satisfied with what we are doing. \n‘’We will not give the state away to absentee politicians who desert the state after elections only come back during elections,” the governor said. \nGaidam described the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 17 local government areas as a clear indication of the people’s appreciation of government’s stride to improve their lives. \n“We have gone a long way in developing our state, we cannot afford the risk of entrusting it into the hands of political jobbers who only think of themselves.” \nThe governor urged people of the state to pray for good leaders who will place public service above personal and selfish interests. \nHe called on the new council chairmen to serve their people in accordance to the APC manifesto and the development goals of the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:41:18.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
