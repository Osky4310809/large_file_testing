He has been identified as 45-year-old Christopher Baldauf. \nA neighbor said she wasn’t surprised to learn there were hoarding conditions inside the home. She said she last spoke with her neighbor last week. The woman said she was doing well, but her son was not. \n“I talked to her on Friday,” said Bonnie McElheny, who lives next door. “I saw her come home from work and I went out to talk to her.” \nMcElheny said her neighbor is in her 60s and rarely comes out of her home, except to go to work. She said the neighbor never let anyone inside the house. \n“Never,” said McElheny. “I have asked her when she had needed help. She’s had packages, and I said, ‘Would you like me to help you?’ and she says, ‘Oh no, no, no, I can do it.’ She never let anybody in.” \nPolice said the woman was in fine, but in need of medical care. She was taken to a local hospital. \nAllegheny County Police are investigating, but don’t believe his death is suspicious. \n“I asked her, I said, how is Christopher doing, and she said not well,” McElheny told KDKA’s Lisa Washington. “This was Friday. ” \n“He never comes out,” she said. \nThe Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office will perform an autopsy. \nAs for the woman, police said she was fine, but in need of medical care. She was taken to a local hospital. \nStay with KDKA for the latest on this developing story. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter Lisa Washington Lisa Washington joined KDKA TV in May of 2015.
