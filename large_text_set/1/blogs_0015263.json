Yeah, probably. Anyway, there’s a joke I think about whenever I watch Virat Kohli play the way he did in the first ODI, with all the batting cheat codes activated. It doesn’t really fit, but I’ll tell you it anyway. In fact, it isn’t even really a joke: \nTwo friends are walking through a jungle and come across a tiger in the distance. The tiger turns and locks its eyes on the pair before sprinting towards them, saliva dripping from its incisors, blood and guts on the mind. One of the blokes starts panicking. The other bends down to tie his shoelaces. “What are you doing – you’re not going to outrun a tiger!” “I don’t have to,” comes the cool response: “I just have to outrun you.” \nKohli, forever and always, is the tiger. And in my mind, the two blokes are bowlers in the middle of a spell together just as Kohli turns the dial to 11. Instead of running away – however smart a tactic that may be in this situation – the chilled one is the bowler lucky enough to deliver most of his over at the other batsman. You see, it stops becoming about suppressing Kohli and morphs dramatically into self-preservation: “How can I get through this with my dignity and limbs in tact?” You’re not bowling in tandem anymore – you’re out there on your own. \nIn the lead-up to today’s second ODI, in Cuttack, England have vowed to quell Kohli with a barrage of short balls. England have decided the best course of action is not to lace up and dash but to charge straight at the tiger. \nThe last time England played at this venue, Kevin Pietersen was captain, Alastair Cook opened the batting and they posted 270 for four (they lost with overs to spare and the rest of the ODI world falling about laughing). That and more in Barney Ronay’s preview . In the meantime, you can get in contact with me – Vish – via the usual channels. Tweet me at @Vitu_E or send longer thoughts to .
