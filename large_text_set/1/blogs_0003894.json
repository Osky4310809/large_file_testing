Getty Images 5 Andrea Radrazzani has carved out a superb reputation for himself in business \n“I am fully aware of the great heritage and traditions of Leeds United and I will endeavour to be a fitting custodian on behalf of the many thousands of Leeds supporters, who are the lifeblood of the club. \n“I am making a long-term commitment to Leeds United and will work to bring stability through ongoing investment. I aim to bring sustainable growth. \n“I won’t do anything that will put the club’s future at risk. PA:Press Association 5 The banned Massimo Cellino will still own a big chunk of Leeds United \n“Through working in the sports industry for many years, I have developed a great passion for the English game and I am honoured to have become joint owner of one of the country’s biggest clubs. \n“I am very impressed with the job Garry Monk has done this season and I will do all I can to support him and the team moving forward. \n“The responsibility is on myself, Massimo and the executive management at the club to work together over the coming months to provide the best platform and environment for Garry and the team to achieve success. Reuters 5 Garry Monk has led his Leeds United side to fifth in the Championship \n“My immediate priorities over the coming weeks are to meet with Garry and the team; the club staff at Elland Road and Thorp Arch; supporters’ representatives; former players and media.” \nLast month, Cellino was slapped with an 18-month ban and a £250,000 fine for his involvement in the Ross McCormack transfer, in the latest piece of controversy surrounding the club owner. \nAfter finalising a deal to take over the club in 2014, Cellino was almost immediately found guilty of tax evasion by an Italian court, with the Football League declaring him as being in breach of its Owners and Directors Test and blocking his buy-out. \nA month later an independent QC overturned the decision allowing the Italian to take control of Leeds United. Getty Images 5 Massimo Cellino has constantly been in trouble with football authorities \nCellino was also disqualified by the Football League for three months back in December 2014 following an investigation into his taxes in Italy. \nHe was disqualified again ten months later following another conviction in his native Italy, while a host of poorly thought-out ideas such as the ‘Pie Tax’ as well as some controversy surrounding his two sons saw Leeds fans demand Cellino to leave. \nSince taking over, no fewer than EIGHT managers have served under the Italian as the merry-go-round whirled into action.
