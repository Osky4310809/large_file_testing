Dave Brat revealed he has heard fierce opposition to his support of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, saying that “women are in my grill, no matter where they go.” \nThe congressman from Virginia was caught on video encouraging his conservative constituents to match the intensity he has confronted from the left. \n“Since Obamacare and those issues have come up, the women are in my grill, no matter where they go,” Brat said. “They come up to me: ‘When is your next town hall?’ And believe me, it is not to give positive input.” \nBrat insisted that the press was spreading misinformation about the effects of replacing the ACA. He suggested that some of his constituents, who are “usually intelligent,” as he described them, have been expressing their contempt for his stance on the health care law. To combat this, Brat called on his audience to speak openly and positively about the repeal of Obamacare. \nThe congressman, who was just reelected to his second term, has avoided hosting a town hall until after the first 100 days of the Trump administration. This has apparently disappointed some of his constituents who wish to debate the merits of the ACA. On Monday, Brat released a statement on Facebook reaffirming his promise to have a town hall—eventually. \n“Over the past couple of weeks my office has been inundated with phone calls, and emails and comments on social media requesting a town hall meeting, and believe me, I fully intend to have plenty of town halls that are open and transparent as soon as our first 100 days agenda is implemented and we come up for a breath of air,” he wrote. \nIn the video which recorded his speech at the conservative group meeting, Brat offered some insight as to who the new president is and which groups he favors. \n“Trump is a loyalty guy. He is total about loyalty. Guess who he is most loyal to: the Evangelicals. He knows he got 40 to 50 million votes. So he’s totally loyal. He is going to be loyal to Israel. They know that. And that’s what I am talking about. He’s spreading this kind of message that unifies us all,” he said. \nBrat then lamented the dissent he has heard from the left, accusing liberals of appropriating Martin Luther King Jr. as their symbolic leader of the resistance against Trump because, after all, the civil rights leader was a Judaeo-Christian. \n“He’s apart of the Judaeo-Christian tradition. And the left has completely stolen him and said it was about Leftist, Marxist, justice stuff. It is false on its face. He never went outside that Judaeo-Christian line.” \nWatch his talk below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:02:22.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
