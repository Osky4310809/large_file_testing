As more info begins to trickle out about the Danny Rand’s return to New York City, the show’s actors have begun opening up about the series. \nStars Finn Jones and Jessica Henwick , who play Rand and Colleen Wing respectively, sat down with Collider to talk about their roles in the new Netflix show. \nWhile they talked about how the final Defender fits into the puzzle of the Marvel Universe at large, they also spoke about the influence of their comic book counterparts. \nBoth Jones and Henwick have experience dealing with expectations, having been involved with beloved series and franchises such as Game of Thrones and Star Wars . \n“What I learned about being on [Game of Thrones], and it was an adaptation, is that it’s important to just deal with the source material that you’ve got in front of you,” Jones said. “You know, I found reading the comic books and watching the other Netflix series is really good for getting an idea of the tone of the character in the shows. I just stayed very focused to our version of Danny Rand and what I can bring to the role, rather than emulate something that’s been before.” \nHenwick agreed. \n“From the comic books, I definitely wanted to pull out that sort of very dry humor that she has, and that no bullshit New Yorker demeanor,” she said. “We keep that. And of course, as the [clips have shown], we also have her signature white jumpsuit look. Not quite as superhero-y as the comics, it’s not spandex, but we give a lot of nods to the comic books.” \nJones added that the version of the character we’ll see on the Netflix show is not the same as the one in the comics. At least, not yet. \n“Danny Rand isn’t a superhero. Not yet, anyway. I think Danny Rand has a long way to go before he can earn the right to call himself the Iron Fist. He has a lot of things to really learn about himself and overcome,” Jones said. \nHenwick added, “He’s had this title thrust upon him, but in so many ways he’s still a kid.” \n“He doesn’t know what to do with it,” Jones continued, “He’s got this huge responsibility, he’s got so many inner issues and inner torment that he has to deal with first before he can actually be responsible, and it’s very interesting to take that angle on it. It’s a really interesting angle that [showrunner] Scott Buck has created.” \nMarvel’s Iron Fist debuts on Netflix on March 17. \nFifteen years after being presumed dead in a plane crash, Danny Rand (Finn Jones) mysteriously returns to New York City determined to reclaim his birthright and family company. However, when a long-destined enemy rises in New York, this living weapon is forced to choose between his family’s legacy and his duties as the Iron Fist. \nMarvel’s Iron Fist was developed by Scott Buck. The Netflix series stars Finn Jones as Danny Rand, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. The cast also includes Jessica Henwick, David Wenham, Jessica Stroup, Tom Pelphrey, and Rosario Dawson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:42:02.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
