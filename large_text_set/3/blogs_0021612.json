Posted Mar 22, 2017 MORE Source: Racchlo photo - Creative Commons License \nOur health -conscious society is always looking for ways to improve our longevity. The usual suggestions that we encounter have to do with diet , weight control, exercise, stress reduction, and the use of various vitamins and other pharmaceutical agents. However, it is becoming clearer that a simple solution that may have a significant health benefit is pet ownership. \nBack in November or early December, I was contacted by a reporter who was preparing one of those articles which you typically see as we approach the New Year. These are articles that try to predict what will happen in the near future. The tack that he was taking was to ask a number of people (mostly scientists and people in the arts) what they felt was going to be \"The Next Great Thing\" in their field. So the kinds of responses which he got included a physicist who talked about a telescope that would work on gravity waves, a physician who talked about drugs which could rearrange your DNA to deal with genetic-based illnesses, while a computer expert predicted that brain waves could be used to directly control machines. When it came to me, my suggestion was that we were learning enough about the health benefits of pet ownership, particularly dogs, so that we might foresee in the near future that doctors might actually prescribe that people of particular ages, or with specific risk factors, should have a dog. I also suggested that if the health benefits were large enough perhaps the cost of acquiring a pet might be covered by medical insurance plans. \nAlthough I really had no expectation that physicians would be prescribing pet ownership this year or next I felt that the proposal was sound. The idea of recommending a dog to improve health comes from a gradually evolving body of data and is not original with me. The American Heart Association produced a task force report that concluded that pet ownership improved health significantly ( click here for more about that). At the time that their report was created little was known about the magnitude of health improvement that pets bring, however even small health benefits can have a massive effect on the cost of healthcare for a nation ( click here for more about that). Still I knew that before doctors would prescribe pets, let alone before medical plans would cover the cost of pets, the size of the benefits would have to be shown to be quite large — for instance showing that pet ownership significantly increased an individual's life span. Unfortunately, such evidence in the scientific literature was sparse at the time of my interview. Furthermore, it is true that people who try to predict the future are more often than not wrong. Therefore I was pleased when I encountered a research report which suggested that things might be trending in a direction which supported my speculations. \nSome new data collected by a team of researchers headed by Enayet Chowdhury at the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at Monash University, in Melbourne, Australia demonstrates just how strong the benefits of pet ownership can be for a targeted population. These researchers decided to look at a particularly vulnerable group of people and at a specific health condition. \nCardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death and disability and accounts for about a third of the total number of all deaths around the world. Older individuals are the most susceptible since approximately 90% of cardiovascular deaths are in people aged 65 or older. So this research team looked at 4,039 individuals who had been diagnosed with hypertension (consistently high blood pressure) and were enrolled in the Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study. Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart attacks. The people who were studied were aged between 65 and 84 years (a high-risk age group). The question was whether pet ownership affected their survival. The individuals in this investigation were monitored for approximately 11 years. During that time interval 24% of the people in the study died and more than half of these (52%) died of cardiovascular problems. \nThe rate of pet ownership in this group of people was fairly typical with 36% of them owning at least one pet at the time of the survey. When you look at individuals who have owned at least one pet at any time during their life that number bumps up to 86%. The investigators noted that 45% of the group owned a dog and 26% owned a cat. \nIt turns out that, consistent with other studies that have looked at health benefits of pets, the survival rate was higher in individuals who currently owned, or had previously owned, a pet. What I found most striking was the size of the effect that a pet had on survival. Over the 11 year period that these high-risk people were monitored, the survival rate was improved by 26% in the individuals who currently own pet and even more surprisingly it was improved by 22% in individuals who had previously owned a pet. These are astonishingly high benefits, and are not too far from the levels of improvement that some pharmaceutical companies advertise for certain drugs that are used to control blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular fatalities. \nIn previous studies of the health benefits of pet ownership it has been found that dogs are more helpful for positive health outcomes than cats, however, that is not the case in this study. It found approximately equal benefits if the pet was a cat or a dog. However, the researchers did find that the greatest improvement in survival was for individuals who owned dogs and took them out for walks frequently. \nThe authors of this study speculate that the health benefits of owning a pet might be that a dog, at least, promotes a more active lifestyle and that active lifestyle leads to better social interactions. Combined with the pet's companionship this can improve a person's emotional state and reduce their stress levels. That is medically important since stress is also a factor that contributes to the likelihood of cardiovascular problems. \nWhatever the reasons, a 26% improvement in survival rate is certainly a significantly large result, and to my mind at least, suggests that prescribing a pet — at least for older individuals who might be at risk for cardiovascular problems — might be something that physicians should consider. Certainly, if these results are replicated in future studies it might also make sense for medical health plans to consider covering part of the cost for acquiring such a \"prescription puppy.\" \nCopyright SC Psychological Enterprises Ltd.
