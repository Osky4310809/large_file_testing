The terrorists tried to enter the premises of the court. \nHowever, the first detonated his suicide vest near the gate, killing seven people and injuring 20 others, including four policemen. On the other hand, the other two terrorists were killed in a shootout with the police. \nThe attack is part of the series of back-to-back terror incidents across the nation in which more than a 100 people have been killed so far. 0 0 Policeman recounts Charsadda attack was posted in pakistan of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on February 21, 2017 and was last updated on February 21, 2017.
