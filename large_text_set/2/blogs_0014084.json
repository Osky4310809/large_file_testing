Eleven per cent said they’d like to see Canada open its doors to even more refugees.\nThe online survey of 1,508 Canadian adults was conducted Feb. 6 – 9 in the wake of an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump that briefly halted entry of all refugees into the U.S., as well as citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. The Trump administration is said to be drafting a revised order in the wake of legal challenges to the original one.\nThe climate of uncertainty in the U.S. is believed to be behind a surge in illegal border crossings into Canada — particularly in Manitoba and Quebec — from asylum-seekers, often under dangerous conditions.\nRelated RCMP say 21 people arrested for illegally crossing border at Emerson, Manitoba Terry Glavin: Canadians are not as good as we pretend (but we’re still pretty good) Canadians not so ‘exceptional’ when it comes to immigration and refugee views, new study finds Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen has said Canada intends to stick to its plan of resettling 40,000 refugees this year.\nAccording to the Angus Reid survey, six in 10 Canadians say the government has “done a good job” of handling the refugee file and about the same number said Ottawa made the right call to maintain its resettlement targets in the wake of Trump’s executive order.\nHowever, one-quarter said Canada should’ve adopted a temporary ban similar to the U.S. policy.\nBroken down by region, those living in B.C. and the Atlantic provinces were most likely to favour allowing more refugees into the country, while half of Albertans and 55 per cent of those in Saskatchewan said the numbers were too high.\nSince November 2015, more than 40,000 Syrian refugees have resettled in more than 350 Canadian communities.\nJust over half of the survey’s respondents — 54 per cent — said they believe refugees aren’t making enough of an effort to “fit into mainstream Canadian society.” The survey did not ask respondents to define what fitting in meant to them.\nHowever, a recent Pew Research Centre poll found that about 90 per cent of Canadians listed the ability to speak English or French and sharing Canadian customs and traditions as important to being “truly Canadian.”\nIt was less important to have been born in Canada or to be Christian, according to the Pew survey.\nJanet Dench, executive director for the Canadian Council for Refugees, said Monday that “generation after generation” likes to complain that newcomers are not fitting in.\n“I suspect many (of the respondents) don’t know newcomers well. Those of us who do know newcomers, know they’re constantly exhausting themselves to do all they need to do make a success of their life in Canada,” she said.\nA better question to ask, she said, is: “What are we doing to ensure newcomers are able to fit in?”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:54:56.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
