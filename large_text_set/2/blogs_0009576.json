In response, Nissan said the ruling was “regrettable,” remaining steadfast that it did not use any illegal devices in its vehicles, and will “consider possible measures.” \nEarlier in the year, South Korean regulators banned the sale of 10 models , including Nissan, BMW and Porsche vehicles after the automakers were discovered to have fabricated certification documents relating to emissions and noise-level tests. The ban also included a combined fine amounting to 7.17 billion won (RM27,700,982).
