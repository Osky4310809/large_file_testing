This isn’t the NBA or baseball where each game doesn’t really matter. This is the NFL where 1 extra loss can make your entire season worthless. So doing anything that takes the result out of the teams hands and putting it on the flip of a coin is bad for the sport. \nAnd don’t give me the other team gets to play defense non sense. That would matter 20 years ago Before the game effectively legislated away defense in favor of more scoring. In the modern NFL it’s much harder to play defense then it is to score on offense. So the team who wins the coin toss gets an extremely unfair advantage. \nAnyway very rarely has the rule change led to more then 1 extra possession for the teams in overtime. So why change it? Mar 20, 2017 4:22 PM \nthey should have never changed it to start with Mar 20, 2017 4:23 PM \nWhy not ruin the game altogether? bertilfox says: Mar 20, 2017 4:27 PM \nThe OT rule is perfect as-is. If you can’t prevent a TD…you lose. There is getting to the tipping point with all of this “More Football More Football More Football”. At some point the game has to end, players need the time to recover and so do fans…to a lesser extent. ee00ee says: Mar 20, 2017 4:30 PM \nThis really is a bad move on their part. In my opinion they should go the opposite direction and make it unlimited time so the game is concluded only with a victory. \nWhile they’re at it they should also be altering the first possession rules at present. It should be both teams guaranteed 1 possession regardless if the first scores a touchdown or not. Make it sudden death AFTER each team has had the ball. redsoxu571 says: Mar 20, 2017 4:30 PM \nIf you have an issue with longer games due to overtime periods, the solution isn’t to go back to “kick a FG – win the game”. If game length and keeping players healthy is the goal, DO AWAY WITH REGULAR SEASON OVERTIME ENTIRELY. The difference between a win and loss in the regular season is HUGE, so to me it would be better to essentially award a team a half-win each than it would to allow a team that has played the other evenly to lose on a quick FG. \nI’m not saying this is my preferred solution, but it seems better to me than going backwards would. knew8411 says: Mar 20, 2017 4:32 PM \nI will just say this….who’s complaining in the first place? If it isn’t broke, don’t fix it. thecatalinawinemixer says: Mar 20, 2017 4:32 PM \nIt would be interesting to see a team have a 10 minute drive starting OT and miss a fg attempt as time expired. What would they do then, as far as the two possession rule? A 10 minute drive is much more probable than a 15 minute one. Mar 20, 2017 4:32 PM \nI would like to see the college overtime. Way more exciting. hazmatt23 says: Mar 20, 2017 4:33 PM \nWhy would they not go the college route where each team gets a possession from a set yard-line. If it’s tied after each team has 2 possessions, they must score a TD/go for 2. This will eliminate the kickoff, eliminate having to punt if we start from, say, the 30 yard line and lessen the likelihood of a tie. mattbilleauthor says: Mar 20, 2017 4:41 PM \nScrap the whole thing during the regular season. A tie is a tie. We have tiebreakers in place for teams finishing with identical records and this will be unaffected by whether a team has a tie game or two on its record. There’s no need for OT until the playoffs. btheballs says: Mar 20, 2017 4:42 PM \ncollege o.t. ball set at 30 for extra point. field goals 50. kickers might start earning money. mmack66 says: Mar 20, 2017 4:44 PM \nThey should just do best 2 out of 3 coin flips to determine the winner. \nBrought to you by Draft Kings. mmack66 says: Mar 20, 2017 4:46 PM \nmattbilleauthor says: Mar 20, 2017 4:41 PM \nScrap the whole thing during the regular season.
