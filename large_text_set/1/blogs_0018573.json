She loudly raises a toast to her dead baby and storms out upset. \nSteve, Tim, Robert, Johnny and Kate set out to find her. But it’s infatuated Robert who gets to her first, and a vulnerable Michelle leans in for a kiss with the handsome chef. The pair then visit Ruairi at the Chapel of Rest. \nMeanwhile, Steve is desperately worried about his wife and eventually gets to the Chapel and finds his wife asleep on the chair.
