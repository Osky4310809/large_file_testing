But winger Drew Stafford, who came to Boston from the Winnipeg Jets at the NHL trade deadline, saved the day by netting his second goal as a Bruin with just under six seconds to go. \nHere’s how it all went down in Boston’s 2-1 victory over the Flyers. \nSAVED BY RASK It can’t be understated how vital Rask was to this contest. The Bruins got off to a pretty solid start and looked to be taking control in the first period with David Pastrnak giving them a 1-0 lead as the frame expired. However, everyone but the 30-year-old goaltender seemed to doze off for the rest of the game. Rask saved nearly everything that came his way, including five shots the Flyers pelted him with during a 5-on-3. The power play usually is a strength for Philadelphia, but Rask made sure the Flyers didn’t get the upper hand. \nSECOND PERIOD LULL The Bruins didn’t look like the same team that was on the ice in the first period once the second rolled around. After putting 11 shots on net to start the game, Boston had just four over the next 20 minutes. The B’s woes continued into the third period, too, until some last-minute aggression propelled them to a win. \nLET’S GET PHYSICAL The Bruins’ slowdown especially was surprising considering the fact that the game started out pretty physical. After delivering a hit to Flyers defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere, Bruins winger Matt Beleskey got into it with Brandon Manning just 10 seconds later.

That game begins a four-game road trip for Boston, which includes a stretch of three games in four days. \nThumbnail photo via Bob DeChiara/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:41:50.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
