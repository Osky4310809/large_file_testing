Outrage can be overwhelming, though: you often feel like opting out just to keep from losing your mind. Focus your attention on one or two issues to keep this from happening. Advertisement \nOver at Medium, lawyer Mirah Curzer suggests a few tactics for staying engaged with social issues without losing your mind. Curzer suggests: \nYou can’t show up to every march and donate to every cause...If you want to be effective on anything, pick an issue or two that matter most to you and fight for them...Important caveat: I’m not saying we collectively should pick a few issues and let everything else fall by the wayside...This is advice to individuals, not the party or the movement as a whole. \nIt’s also not to say other issues are less important or that you should turn a blind eye to them. Curzer’s point is that, just like anything else, too many options can lead to analysis paralysis. As she puts it, “Sure, retweet and share on Facebook about your peripheral issues, but focus your real energy on the things you care about most.” Advertisement \nMake sure to head to Curzer’s post at the link below—the full post is definitely worth the read.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:38:25.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
