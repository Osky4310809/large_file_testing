A purported live picture of the handset was leaked recently and it may have provided us our first proper look at the upcoming flagship. We saw in that leaked picture that Samsung had ditched the home button and repositioned the fingerprint sensor on the back alongside the camera. Images of what are claimed to be the official Galaxy S8 cases have appeared online today and they suggest the same thing. \nSamsung is expected to offer the 5.7-inch Galaxy S8 and 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus this year. We can see cases for both models are more or less the same with the only noticeable difference being that of the dimensions. That’s because both models are said to feature dual-edge curved displays so the design itself will be very similar. \nThe cut out on the back appears to be big enough for the rear camera and the flash on both models. You’ll see that the cut out for the fingerprint sensor is right beside it and it’s unclear if it’s big enough to allow proper recognition of the finger. \nBe that as it may, nothing is confirmed officially at this point in time so take this with a grain of salt. It’s common for many fake “leaks” to surface prior to the launch of a flagship smartphone so we have to be careful with what we believe right now. \nSamsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy S8 at a special event next month but it might show off a one-minute teaser of the new flagship later this month at the Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:12:59.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
