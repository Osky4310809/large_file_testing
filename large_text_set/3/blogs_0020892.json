Yogi Adityanath met BJP president Amit Shah on Tuesday. PTI \nConsidering BJP has a huge three-fourths majority in the state Assembly, chances of dissatisfied MLAs raising a dissenting note in public or escalating the issue with the party's top leadership are quite remote. Moreover, the elections were fought and won using Prime Minister Narendra Modi's development agenda, not through individual candidates. Therefore, MLAs and ministers aren't in any position to throw their weight ahead of the leadership. \nChief minister Yogi Adityanath is known for his independent mind, and for being a tough decision maker. He would have ensured the implementation of what he thinks ought to be the policy of the party or his government. Adityanath visited New Delhi on Tuesday and held consultations with Modi and party president Amit Shah regarding issues of portfolio allocation. He also met Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The former has been BJP's tallest leader in UP, and a former chief minister of the state. But it's not yet clear whether Adityanath did discuss portfolio allocation or government formation with the senior leaders. \nThe party leadership had also taken an inordinately long time to make up their mind about naming Yogi Adityanath as CM. They also named two deputy chief ministers — Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma. \nThe key portfolio to watch out for will be the state Home Ministry. It is the chief minister who traditionally holds the home ministry, although there are reports suggesting Maurya wants this for himself. Even if not Home Ministry, Maurya and Sharma will get meaty portfolios. What that is, will be interesting to see. \nThere are other senior leaders — who have been ministers in previous governments — who will also be eyeing plum portfolios in the new Cabinet. These include Surya Pratap Shahi, Swami Prasad Maurya, Satish Mahana, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, Suresh Khanna, Dhara Singh Chouhan, SP Singh Baghel, Ramapati Shastri, Om Prakash Rajbhar, Brijesh Pathak, Chetan Chauhan, Srikanth Sharma and Siddharth Nath Singh. \nSome of them have already expressed their preferences to Adityanath, although the party has clearly said that it will be the chief minister's prerogative that will decide the allocation. \n  02:25   02:25 pm Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T11:02:23.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
