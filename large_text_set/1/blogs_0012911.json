Users everywhere will be able to broadcast live anywhere, anytime, from any device with an internet connection and a camera.\nSEE ALSO: People are gripped by this LAPD car chase streamed live on Facebook\nUntil now, going live required either a phone running the Facebook app or, for publishers especially, specialized streaming camera rigs. With the update, Pages will have the option to broadcast directly via a laptop or desktop's webcam.\nAlong with the browser update, Pages will also have the ability to designate \"Live Contributors,\" essentially creating anchor roles for multiple people within an organization. Until now, only Page administrators could go live from an account, which caused many a logistics headache for media outlets.\nThese updates came on the heels of the news that Facebook is finally monetizing its video content and the much longer announcement about the launch of the Facebook Journalism Project , which aims to dominate save journalism, or something.\nWhile these are helpful tools for publishers looking to create content, the upcoming wider rollout of Live on browsers will give normal Facebook users even greater access to their friends' timelines. When asked, Facebook reps declined to provide any insight on when that rollout might happen.\nIn some peoples' opinion , going live should be saved for only the most noteworthy moments. Just think about the ( slightly desperate ) ad campaign Facebook kicked off recently promoting the service — how \" awesome \" are you sitting at your desk in front of your webcam?\nNot awesome. Not awesome at all.\nBut people will still use the tool, and all of our timelines will undoubtedly soon be filled with desk-bound self-help pep talks and angry rants from people we forgot we once knew.\nSo for everyone desperate to dodge the deluge of Live broadcasts sure to bombard you with notifications as everyone realizes all they need to do is switch on their webcam, here's the magic sequence you'll need to stay sane: Settings > Notifications > On Facebook > Live Videos > Off.\nBONUS: The Obamas got real emotional at the president's farewell address", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/zbLczcwI.m3u8", "https://media.fb.com/2017/01/11/live-updates-for-publishers/", "https://twitter.com/AffiliateBuildr/status/802782285707649025/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/zbLczcwI.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-12T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T04:40:39.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
