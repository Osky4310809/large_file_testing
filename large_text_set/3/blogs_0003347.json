By: Manika Gupta | Updated: March 5, 2017 12:57 PM The message is becomong clear “go back Indians otherwise you will have to lose your life”. (Twitter) \nYesterday we heard the news of Indian-origin convenience store owner Harnish Patel, 43, of Lancaster been shot dead in his yard. Today, the news of 39-year-old Sikh man was injured when an unidentified person shot him outside his home and shouted “go back to your own country”. 10 days back it was the Kansas techie. The message is becomong clear “go back Indians otherwise you will have to lose your life”. \nHarmless Indians are being killed, look at what this sikh, the latest victim was doing? The Sikh man was working on his vehicle outside his home in the city of Kent in the Washington state when he was approached by a strange, who walked up to the driveway. In the other case, Harnish Patel the owner of a convenience store in Lancaster County, South Carolina, was found dead of gunshot wounds in his own front yard. \nSadly, this form of hate violence is becoming far too common. Since the presidential election, when Donald Trump got elected, organizations have documented upticks in reports of bias and harassment of immigrants and Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Arab and South Asian communities. President Trump’s criminalization policies that target immigrants, Muslims and people of color through bans, walls and raids have only exacerbated this climate. The administration’s actions send a clear message to the public: Certain people do not belong in America. Given this context, it is not surprising that reports of harassment and discrimination towards Jewish community centers, homes and mosques continue to rise. this seems to be related to economic prosperity of Hindus and Jews. As we know that both Jews and Indians are extremely prosperous communities in the US. \nSo the message that is coming across through various acts of Mr Trump is that colour and religion are becoming very important in the formerly liberal democratic country. And that the white christian Americans will not tolerate the immigrants that are of different colour or religion. This is contrarty to the tradition of the United States of America, which started off as a country of immigrants. It is a melting pot where everyone was welcome. \nUnless this pattern of government-sanctioned hostility toward communities of color, Muslims, and immigrants radically changes, condemnations of hate violence can only go so far. And Indian-Americans in particular should demand more than words from the administration. While negotiations are on at the country level, Mr Trump seems to have made up his mind to perpetuate government-sanctioned hostility amongst the communities.
