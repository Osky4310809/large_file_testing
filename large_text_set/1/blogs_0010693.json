The Coens wrote the script and will direct the project, which Annapurna describes as a “Western anthology.” \nThe Coens were given executive producer credit on FX’s “Fargo,” but were not actually involved in the development or production of that series (which was loosely inspired by their iconic film). \nREAD MORE: The Coen Brothers to Pen Illegal Drug Market Thriller ‘Dark Web’ \n“Buster Scruggs” reps the latest attempt by the Coen brothers to move into TV, a trend that has increased in recent years among auteur filmmakers. In 2011, the Coens developed the hour-long single-camera comedy “HarveKarbo” for Fox. The project, which they co-created with Phil Johnston, was developed through Imagine TV but ultimately didn’t move forward. \nIn a press release, Annapurna said is mulling “an innovative television and theatrical integrated approach” for the distribution of “Buster Scruggs.” Besides the Coens, Annapurna chief Megan Ellison and new Annapurna TV head Sue Naegle will executive produce. The Coens are producing through their Mike Zoss Productions. \nREAD MORE: Coen Brothers Join TV Migration with Detective Comedy \n“We are very excited to be working with Megan and Sue on this project,” Joel and Ethan Coen said in a statement. Variety first reported the news. \nAnnapurna is also developing an adaptation of Maria Semple’s novel “Today Will Be Different,” starring Julia Roberts. \nThis Article is related to: Television and tagged Annapurna , Coen Brothers , Ethan Coen , Joel Coen More From IndieWire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T03:03:57.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
