The source added that all Woods has been able to do of late is putt.\" \nJust last week at the Valspar Championship , Steve Stricker told reporters while he has not seen Woods recently, he has been in contact with those who have, and the news wasn't encouraging. \n“He’s working hard at it, but I don’t think he’s doing that well right now physically,” Stricker said. \nIn the event Woods does skip the year's first major, it will mark the third time in the last four years that Woods has failed to show up at Augusta National.
