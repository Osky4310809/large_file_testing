Oshie’s 30 and Alex Ovechkin’s 29. Long overlooked for All-Star consideration — as he was again this season — Backstrom is playing at a level that’s hard to ignore. \n“It seems like Backstrom might be the team MVP this year,” Junkies host John-Paul Flaim noted. \n“Yeah, I think if you were going probably in order, I would probably say it would have to be probably Nicky, Holtz, and then it’d be really close between Oshie and probably Ovi,” Trotz said. \n“Wow,” Flaim said. “Well, that tells you how strong the team is, that Ovi could be fourth in the team MVP race.” \n“They’re loaded,” Jason Bishop remarked. “I mean they’re loaded.” \nFollow @ChrisLingebach and @1067TheFan on Twitter.
