Oakland: 2 13. New York Jets: 2 \nFour more teams — Tennessee, San Diego, Tampa Bay, Los Angeles/St. Louis — have one championship game appearance apiece, and that’s it. \nIn 17 opportunities as head coach of the Patriots, Belichick has led his team to the conference title game in 65 percent of his seasons. (He’s made it to the Super Bowl 38 percent of the time, with a chance now to make it 41 percent, but that’s a story perhaps for another day next week.) \nIn those 17 seasons there are 10 teams — nearly a third of the league — that have not reached even one conference championship game. The poor Buffalo Bills haven’t even tasted a playoff game in that time. The Bengals own a sad 0-7 postseason record in that span. \nThose teams all spend countless hours every week of every year trying to improve, all with the goal of playing a game with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line. Some teams have been unable to do it at all. Other teams — even some that are considered “successful”— have done it two or three times. \nBut the Patriots — ever-relevant, always legitimate — have made this trip 11 times since the turn of the century. \nYou can take this picture and take it one step further, too, as the Patriots have won six conference title games. The Steelers have won three, as have the Giants. The Ravens, Colts, Panthers, Seahawks and Broncos have each won two. The Eagles are 1-4. The Packers are 1-2.

That is to be expected. \nBut with plenty of time between now and the kickoff, it’s always worthwhile to zoom out and compare the Patriots to the rest of the league during what has been a historic run that does not appear ready to end any time soon. \nYou can or find him on Twitter @michaelFhurley .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:58:40.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
