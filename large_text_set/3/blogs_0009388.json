More than 80 percent of ballots were in favor of the measure, with a two-thirds' majority required for approval. \nThe results come 10 months after Muirfield's first vote on the subject came up just short of passing, with only 64 percent of ballots in favor. The course was promptly removed from The Open rota, and Muirfield announced in June that a second vote would soon be held. \nShortly after the latest results were announced, the R&A released a statement allowing the club to re-join the rota for golf's oldest major. \n\"In light of today's decision by the Honourable Company we can confirm that Muirfield will become a venue for The Open once again,\" said R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers. \"Muirfield has a long and important history of hosting The Open, and with today's announcement that will continue.\" \nMuirfield has hosted The Open 16 times, most recently when Phil Mickelson won in 2013. With St. Andrews expected to host the tournament's 150th edition in 2021, the next likely opening on the calendar would be in 2022.
