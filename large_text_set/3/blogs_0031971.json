The NHL has an expansion team opening in Las Vegas next season. \nThe Raiders will continue to play in Oakland for at least 2017 and 2018. The new stadium in Las Vegas is expected to be completed in 2020. It has not been determined yet where the Raiders will play in 2019. \n“My father used to say that the greatness of the Raiders is in the future,” said Raiders owner Mark Davis, son of Al Davis. “And the opportunity to develop a world-class stadium in the entertainment capital in the world is one opportunity that will give us the ability to achieve that. I have mixed feelings, obviously. I love Oakland. I love the fans of Oakland. I know there’s going to be disappointment, and maybe some anger. … It wasn’t the players, it wasn’t the coaches that made this decision. It was me that made it.” \nThe decision came with a $750 million commitment in public money for a new stadium. The Raiders are also getting a $650 million loan from Bank of America. The stadium will be near the Las Vegas Strip, where sports gambling is legal. \nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the league’s stadium and finance committees have been working on this relocation for nine months. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie is part of the finance committee, so he was directly involved in the discussions. When the final vote was taken on Monday, 31 of 32 owners approved the move. Poll Should the Eagles trade Jordan Matthews? Yes. Only if they add more receiving help in the draft. Vote Results \n“We’re all disappointed,” Goodell said. “We’re particularly disappointed for the fans of the Oakland Raiders. This is something that will be seen with a great deal of disappointment by them. We understand that.” \nThe Rams moved from St. Louis to Los Angeles in January 2016. The Chargers announced they were moving from San Diego to Los Angeles in January. (The Eagles will play both teams this season.) \nThe Eagles’ final game in Oakland was in November 2013, when Nick Foles threw seven touchdown passes. The Raiders will visit Lincoln Financial Field again this year, and the Eagles don’t play the AFC again until 2021. \nMore to come.
