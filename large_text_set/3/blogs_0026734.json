Penn isn’t done yet. The 38-year-old Hawaiian will remain at featherweight and face Dennis Siver at UFC Fight Night 112 in Oklahoma City. The matchup and event were announced Wednesday during UFC Tonight. Three other pairings were announced for the card: Johny Hendricks vs. Tim Boetsch at middleweight; Felice Herrig vs. Justine Kish at strawweight and Josh Stansbury vs. Jeremy Kimball at light heavyweight. UFC Fight Night 112 takes place at Chesapeake Energy Arena on June 25 and will be televised on Fox Sports 1. The card does not yet have a main event. Penn returned from a retirement that lasted more than two years at UFC Fight Night 103, when he suffered a second-round technical knockout loss to Mexican prospect Yair Rodriguez . “The Prodigy” hasn’t won in the Octagon since a 21-second knockout of Matt Hughes at UFC 123 in November 2010. Siver, meanwhile, will return to action for the first time since falling to Tatsuya Kawajiri via unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night 69 in June 2015. The 38-year-old German has won just once in his last five outings — a three-round verdict over Charles Rosa at UFC Fight Night 53. After a lengthy stint at welterweight that included a championship victory, Hendricks dropped to 185 pounds at UFC Fight Night 105, where he earned a unanimous decision triumph against Hector Lombard . That snapped a three-fight skid for “Bigg Rigg.” Boestch had a two-fight winning streak snapped at UFC 208, as he was submitted in the opening stanza by top middleweight contender Ronaldo Souza . Prior to that, “The Barbarian” had earned consecutive triumphs against Rafael Natal and Josh Samman .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:00:00.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
