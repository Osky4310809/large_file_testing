Read More When does Call The Midwife start? Drama set to return for series six Jack Ashton, who plays Tom in Call The Midwife, revealed more about the new series (Photo: BBC/ITV) \nThalidomide, the drug prescribed to pregnant women to help with their nausea during the 1960s, resulted in a wave of birth defects and numerous deaths among babies. \nFans of Call The Midwife have already seen the story arc involving Dr Patrick Turner and his wife Shelagh slowly figuring out that the medication they are giving pregnant mothers are actually doing more harm than good. \nNow, we'll get to see how the married couple are instrumental in stopping the drug being handed out in Poplar, and how the medical establishment reacts to their research. Jack said the sixth series will tackle even darker subjects (Photo: ITV/BBC) \nThe show's creators previously revealed the sixth series will deal with a lot more darker subjects, including domestic violence, female genital mutilation and babies born with Down's syndrome. \nIt will also tackle the introduction of the Pill, a pregnant woman with dwarfism and show the East End of London's attitude to homosexuality in 1962. \n\"They don't shy away from it, and that's what's lovely about it,\" Jack said of the show's writers.

(Photo: ITV) \n\"I think in this series there's even more – we've got domestic violence, the changing face of the East End, then we've got much more about the changing faces of the community. And the thalidomide that's been running through the last few series – we'll revisit the Maddocks family, so you have to make sure you have the tissues available for every episode.\" \nHeidi Thomas, creator of the BBC1 show, has said the upcoming series is even more seeped in the culture of its day. \n\"As the team settle back into Poplar after their South African adventure, we'll see them grappling with all the contradictions and opportunities of the early 1960s – the beacon of the Pill, the shadow of the Kray twins, the lure of independence and the call to duty. The nurses - Barbara, Trixie and Patsy - return for series 6 of Call The Midwife (Photo: BBC) \n\"And time and time again, in an age of change and danger, we will be reminded of the simple power of love,\" she promised. \nCall The Midwife returns on Sunday 22nd January at 8pm on BBC1.
