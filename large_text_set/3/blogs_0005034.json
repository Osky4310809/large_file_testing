Durkin | 7:52 am, March 2nd, 2017 \nNBC caught up with Attorney General Jeff Sessions this morning, just hours after a Washington Post report said that Sessions did not disclose contact he had with the Russian ambassador during the campaign when he was going through his Senate Judiciary hearing to become the nation’s top prosecutor. \n“Well I have not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaign,” Sessions said minutes ago. “And those remarks are unbelievable to me and are false. I don’t have anything else to say about that.” \nThe Attorney General did state, however, that he would consider recusing himself for any Justice Department investigation, should the situation come to that. \nDuring his January 10 hearing , Sessions told Democrat Al Franken (MN), “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.” WaPo’s report says Sessions spoke with Sergey Kislyak twice, once in July and once in September, when Sessions was on the Armed Services Committee in addition to a campaign stalwart on behalf of Donald Trump . \n“There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,” Sessions’ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said late Wednesday. \nVermont Democratic senator Patrick J. Leah y later followed up with Sessions for clarification, writing to the Alabama senator, “Several of the President-elect’s nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?” \nSessions’ one word response? “No.” \nWatch above via MSNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T16:32:08.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
