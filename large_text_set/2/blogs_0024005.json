But one look at the candidates says something about the Democrats' direction: It's far left.\nNeither of the two main candidates to head one of the nation's two major parties is a moderate.\nRep. Keith Ellison, whom The Hill claims is now the front-runner, is a far-left convert to Islam and former supporter of the anti-Semitic Nation of Islam who has garnered the support of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and his followers, Senate progressive queen Elizabeth Warren, and Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\nMeanwhile, President Obama's former Labor Secretary, Tom Perez, is running second to Ellison, the Hill's count shows. But Perez is another extreme leftist lawyer, and former Sen. Teddy Kennedy aide, who fought voter ID laws for the Obama administration and even refused to say that he would protect First Amendment religious speech rights in testimony before Congress.\nBoth far-left lawyers who have little respect for the Constitution and have advocated a range of extreme-left views completely out of touch with the mainstream of American thinking. In short, great candidates to head today's leftward-surging Democratic Party.\nOn Wednesday night, candidates for the top spot in the DNC spoke at a multi-day meeting in Atlanta. It was all anti-Trump, all the time, with Ellison even calling for his impeachment with less than one month in office. Not much reaching out to actual voters, however. Just raw, far-left anger, and even claims of creeping \"fascism.\"\nThe battle for the DNC is emblematic of what's going on across the Democratic Party, both in Congress and in the states. Moderates are purged, conservative Democrats are nonexistent, and the party's leaders seem intent on turning it into a party of hard socialism as quickly as possible.\nNo, this is not your father's Democratic Party. Indeed, none of the Donkey Party's more famous standard-bearers of the recent past would be comfortable in the new Democratic Party. Not JFK. Not Jimmy Carter.\nHeck, even Bill Clinton, a moderate-progressive president who actually reached out to the opposing party to get things done, looks plainly uncomfortable among this generation of hyper-ideological party leaders.\nThe fact is, the party has been largely taken over by government worker unions and left-wing billionaires and their PACs, including the omnipresent self-described socialist George Soros and climate change extremist Tom Steyer.\nWith thousands of foot soldiers trained and battle-hardened in the Occupy Wall Street and Bernie Sanders for president movements, they are pushing the party to the hard left.\nAs we noted recently, the few remaining moderates in the party such as former presidential candidate James Webb don't even recognize the party anymore. It's that radical.\nThe Democratic Party, former Senator Webb says , has moved \"very far to the left\" in recent years. A \"focus on identity politics,\" he says, has cost the Dems a \"key part of the their base.\"\nWhat's strange is it seems those now steering the boat have learned nothing from the last eight years of Obamaism.\nIn \"Liberal Activists Warn Party's Lawmakers: Primaries Are Coming,\" the McClatchy Washington, D.C., bureau notes that a \" coalition of progressive groups \" staffed by former Bernie Sanders campaign activists are organizing to to push the party further left than it already is.\nSimilarly, Center for American Progress executive Steve Phillips, writing in \"Move Left, Democrats\" in The New York Times, argues that Americans are really much more left-leaning than people think.\nAnd of course, standing behind it all, is former President Obama, the first president to remain in Washington, D.C., after his terms were finished, apparently so he can make life hell for his successor.\nYes, Obama, as the nation's first black president, was and remains personally popular. But his policies? Not so much. Yet, the current party would double down on Obama's policy mistakes.\nObamaCare, the failed national health care takeover that Americans despise? Today's Democrats would go even further into failure with single payer, if they could.\nDodd-Frank's regulation heavy smothering of the financial markets? Democrats seem to think that businesses owe their existence to the government, and there's nothing that ails Wall Street that sending a few CEOs and entrepreneurs to prison wouldn't cure.\nIn case you're wondering why consumer and business confidence is soaring and the stock market is surging, it isn't because people think Dodd-Frank is going to survive.\nGet the picture? This is where the Democrats are going. It's important to note that Obama's progressive legacy is really one of political defeat for the Democrats.\nDon't believe it? Today, Republicans hold an estimated 4,170 state legislative seats nationwide, up 1,000 since the start of Obama's first term.\nAt the same time, the GOP controls 33 governorships, up from 21 at the start of Obama's tenure in office. They now control both houses of Congress.\nAs Glenn Greenwald of the Intercept recently observed, the Republicans are but one state legislature away from being able to change the Constitution.\nThis is what Obama-style progressivism has wrought for the Democrats. And yet, they seem eager to move even further in that direction.\nA recent Gallup Poll gave progressive Democrats a massive shot in the arm by showing that 25% of Americans now identify as liberal, up from 21% just a year ago.\nFair enough, but 36% of Americans still call themselves conservative. And 34% call themselves moderate. With the Democrats moving ever-farther leftward, it will be harder and harder for them to claim the 70% of Americans that no longer will identify with the Dems' extreme beliefs — something we already saw in the 2016 election.\nThe Democrats' lurch to the left is a tragedy for a once-great party. But for the Republicans, it is an enormous opportunity to craft a governing majority for years to come — unless, like the delusional Democrats, they blow it.\nRELATED: \nIs James Webb The Only Sane Democrat Left? \nDemocrats Are Losing Their War With Trump \nWhy Are Trump's Approval Numbers So Low?
