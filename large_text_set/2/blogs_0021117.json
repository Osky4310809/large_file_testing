The guy who scored the lone goal is the best bet and that was Alexis. The Chilean was generally dangerous, but it's hard to threaten opposing defenses when you don't get the ball and that was Alexis' problem. This could have gone to Laurent Koscielny, who was excellent before going off injured, but he did get hurt and Bayern feasted on Arsenal from that point on. AP AP Atletico Madrid: Kevin Gameiro \nGameiro got on the scoresheet from the penalty spot, but he made his presence felt the whole match. He popped up everywhere and Bayer had no idea how to track him, let alone what to do when he got on the ball. Antoine Griezmann's goal was all because of Gameiro, who has proven to be the perfect partner to his more heralded compatriot. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP Barcelona: Neymar \nNo one on Barcelona was good. The whole team was bulldozed, but the couple bright moments they had did come through Neymar. Jean Catuffe Getty Images Bayer Leverkusen: Kevin Kampl \nKampl showed up all over the pitch, shooting from distance, passing deep into the Atleti end, carrying the ball through the middle and even making a handful of excellent tackles in defense. On a day when Bayer were stretched out and needed a couple excellent performances, only Kampl gave them one. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP Bayern Munich: Thiago Alcantara \nA lot of Bayern Munich players were terrific in their thrashing of Arsenal, but Alcantara stood out above the rest. Not only did he score two goals, but his passing was at the heart of many Bayern forays forward. He wasn't just initiating some attacks, he was getting forward and making deadly passes in the final third too. It was a total performance from the midfielder. AP AP Benfica: Kostas Mitroglou \nBenfica didn't exactly play beautifully and no one stood out as a truly transcendent player, but they did walk away winners. That's because Mitroglu found them that one crucial goal that gives them an advantage heading to Dortmund. UEFA UEFA via Getty Images Borussia Dortmund: Julian Weigl \nBVB were far from their best in Portugal, but Weigl was excellent as always. Most of Dortmund's best chances came when he started an attack and his passing was predictably brilliant. Part of the reason Benfica couldn't take control despite BVB's struggles was Weigl's control of the middle of the field. He continues to show just how good he is. TF-Images Getty Images Juventus: Miralem Pjanic \nJuventus completely dictate tempo and space because of Pjanic? Same old story, but never any less impressive. Porto's early red card obviously made things easier on Juve, but Pjanic did the bulk of the work on a day where the Old Lady had few players play poorly, but just as few standout.

That they only lost 2-1 is a near miracle, but the Foxes backstop was that good. \nDemarai Gray also deserves a mention, more to highlight how ridiculous it is that he didn't start than anything else. Manchester City: Leroy Sane \nWas it the way he set up Manchester City's opening goal? Or scored his own? Or generally terrified the Monaco defense every time he touched it? \nYes, it was all those things. Sane was a monster. AMA Sports Photo Agency Getty Images Monaco: Kylian Mbappe \nIt's far too early to call Mbappe \"The Next Thierry Henry,\" but it's not hard to see why some people have done it. He gave Manchester City fits and Nicolas Otamendi is probably still having nightmares about him. Mbappe's pace was obvious, but it was how smart his runs were and how assured he was once he got the ball at his feet that really stood out. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP Napoli: Lorenzo Insigne \nThings didn't go so well for Napoli, who were simply overwhelmed by Real Madrid as the match went on, but they did start brightly. That's because Insigne had the audacity to shoot from 35 yards after he spotted Keylor Navas off his line. Eight minutes in, Napoli led because of their diminutive Italian and while that lead disappeared quickly, they have a chance in the second leg because of that crucial away goal. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP Paris Saint-Germain: Blaise Matuidi \nThere are any number of players who could have been called PSG's best. Their press completely destroyed Barcelona and that was a total team effort, but Matuidi seemed to get involved more than most. He forced turnovers and was pressuring Barca players all the way up the pitch, as well as all the way back. It was evident just how much ground he was covering when he got in behind the Barcelona defense on a couple occasions and even could have had a goal. This content is subject to copyright. AFP/Getty Images Porto: Ivan Marcano \nAlex Telles' 27th-minute red card should have doomed Porto, and eventually it did, but for a while it looked like the Portuguese just might hold off Juventus. That's because they were truly excellent at the back and Marcano was the standout there. You can't blame the team for Telles' mistake. They performed admirably, especially Marcano. This content is subject to copyright. AFP/Getty Images Real Madrid: Casemiro \nOn a team with Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, it's Casemiro who keeps things together and we saw that again against Napoli. It was the defensive midfielder who ran the show and provided a very necessary shield for the Real Madrid backline. He was quick to initiate the transition, too, and even added a goal. Casemiro was nothing short of sensational. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP Sevilla: Steven N'Zonzi \nSevilla took the match to Leicester and it was because of what they did in the center of the field. N'Zonzi won the ball and distributed it so frighteningly fast that the Foxes could never really catch up.
