They include housewives, young women and students,\" Ambreen Sheikh, chief executive of the Paxi cab service, told the Reuters Thompson Foundation. \nAccording to a report released by Karachi's Urban Resource Center late last year, 55 percent of the women who commute by public buses said that they felt insecure and faced sexual harassment in Karachi, with some districts in the east rated as the most unsafe for female commuters.

She said there was a need for such a service as most women \"think thrice\" before getting in a vehicle driven by a man. \nBut Zebunnisa Burki, a Karachi-based journalist, said many women in the city cannot afford to take taxis. \n\"Women-focused transport initiatives are important in that they serve a growing demographic of mobile women,\" she said by email.
