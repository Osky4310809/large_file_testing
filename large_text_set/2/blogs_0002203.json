This is the only way we will endure this shameful period of this administration.”\nKhan, a Pakistani-born U.S. citizen from Charlottesville,joined with Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) to introduce a religious-freedom bill, which Beyer said would prohibit the use of faith-based litmus tests to ban immigrants, refugees and international visitors trying to enter the country.\nThe legislation failed last session, but Beyer said Trump’s executive order demanded its reintroduction.\nKhizr Khan, a Pakistani American lawyer and Gold Star father, speaks Thursday on Capitol Hill. (Alex Brandon/Associated Press) “Let’s not mince words: This ban is the culmination of xenophobia and anti-Muslim rhetoric by President Trump and makes us less safe,” said the congressman, who went to Dulles International Airport last weekend to demand that those affected by the ban be allowed into the country.\n“Trump ignores the very real, human consequences of this action.”\nSeveral bill co-sponsors also spoke: House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D.C.), Rep. Jan Schakowsky (Ill.), Rep. Betty McCollum (Minn.) and Rep. André Carson (Ind.).\nNo Republicans are co-sponsors.\nThe White House says the travel ban is designed to allow the United States to improve its security-screening processes and is not aimed specifically at Muslims.\n“These [countries] were identified because their governments lacked the ability to properly screen … It has nothing to do with religion,” Michael C. Short, a White House spokesman, said Thursday. “It’s patently false, misleading and they should knock it off.”\nKhan, who is Muslim, first entered the spotlight at the Democratic National Convention in July , when he held up a pocket Constitution during his speech and wondered aloud whether Trump had ever read it.\nKhan’s son, a U.S. Army captain , was killed in Iraq in 2004 while protecting his unit from a suicide bomber.\nAfter the convention, a Democratic activist from Tennessee started an online fundraising campaign to try to persuade Khan to run for office.\nAsked Thursday whether he had decided to do so, Khan answered, “Not yet.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@psullivan1"], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:21:16.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
