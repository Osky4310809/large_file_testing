Senate PRIB/Released \nMANILA, Philippines — Fears of being arrested and of jeopardizing the life of his loved ones were among the reasons retired SPO3 Arthur Lascañas gave for allegedly lying before a Senate panel in October 2016. \nAt the resumption of the inquiry on extrajudicial killings on Monday, Lascañas said SPO4 Sonny Buenavantura advised him to \"deny everything\" including the testimony of self-confessed hitman Edgar Matobato who appeared before a Senate panel in October 2016. \nLascañas said the death squad existed and would act upon order of then Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, but he initially did not choose to reveal details under oath due to fear of being arrested. \nHe said Buenaventura's message was sent through a certain police Superintendent Antonio Rivera, who also knew of the paramilitary group's operations. \n\"So (Rivera) told me 'if ever you are forced to attend, deny everything. That is the instruction of SPO4 Sonny Buenaventura,\" Lascañas said. \nHe also apologized and asked for understanding for a supposedly false testimony before members of the Senate.   \nAt last year's hearing, Lascañas, who was a retiring police officer, dismissed Matobato's claims on the Davao Death Squad, saying the group is merely a product of \"media hype.\" \nNow Lascañas sought to disavow his earlier testimony and admitted that he was one of the more \"senior\" members of the group, which operated under a police \"Heinous Crimes Division,\" among other names. \nREAD: Lascanas: No such thing as Davao Death Squad \nHe added that he decided to make a public confession because he wanted to tell the truth and to clear his conscience. \nReacting to a news conference in February where Lascañas first appeared to announce his plan to retract his denials, officials of President Duterte denied his allegations and called him a tainted witness.
