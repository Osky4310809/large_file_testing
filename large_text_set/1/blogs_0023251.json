One of the biggest award shows in the world, The Academy Awards or Oscars, taking place in about a month, released its nominations this week, and we are very excited. Plus, the nominations this year include the most diverse crop of nominees yet, including Dev Patel becoming the third Indian origin actor to be nominated, which is giving us some hope for 2017. So, in preparation for the much-awaited ceremony, these are the Oscar-nominated films you should catch up on, if you haven’t already. \nArrival \nThe science fiction film is based on Ted Chiang’s short story, Story of your Life . The film documents an alien invasion across the world, and the attempts of a team led by linguist Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams), to understand their alien visitors and prevent life-threatening danger to humanity. The film is nominated in the Best Picture category, but unfortunately, lead actress Amy missed out on a Best Actress in a Lead Role nomination, in what is being called one of the biggest snubs of the year. \nFences \nDirected and starred-in by legendary actor, Denzel Washington, Fences tells the story of a man and his family in the 1950s. The film is based on the late August Wilson’s play of the same name. It depicts Troy Maxson (played by Denzel), a sanitation worker’s struggle with coming to terms with the unfulfillment of his dream of becoming a baseball player, and how his troubles cause him to make a decision that could break up his family. The actor-director is also nominated in the Best Actor in a Lead Role category, for the film. \nHacksaw Ridge \nDirected by the extremely controversial, but brilliant Mel Gibson, the film tells the story of World War II medic, Desmond Doss, who survived the battle of Okinawa without hurting or killing anyone, and saved 75 lives. Although he believed that the war was justified, his religious beliefs were brought to the fore because of his anti-killing stance. Doss received the Congressional Medal of Honour for his services, in a one-of-a-kind situation, being someone who refused to kill during war. The lead role is flawlessly played by Andrew Garfield, who is also nominated in the Best Actor category. \nHell or High Water \nStarring a strong cast of Chris Pine, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges, the film is about two brothers with their own individual set of problems, who rob multiple branches of the bank that is attempting to foreclose on their family ranch, in order to save it. Brothers, Toby (Chris Pine), a divorcee trying to take care of his son, and Tanner (Ben Foster), an ex-con, come together in a final, vengeful attempt to save their family, but are met with opposition from a Texas Ranger, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges), looking to make one last triumph before retirement. \nHidden Figures \nBased on the true story of female African-American mathematicians at NASA, the film stars a stellar female cast of musician and actress, Janelle Monáe, Octavia Spencer and Taraji P. Henson. These three women, known as ‘human computers’, were some of the greatest minds in the history of the organisation, and were instrumental in launching the mission to send the first American into space to orbit the Earth. \nLa La Land \nUndoubtedly the frontrunner of 2016, musical La La Land has a whopping 14 nominations at the Oscars. These include Best Film, and Best Actor and Actress (in a Lead Role) nominations for Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, respectively, and of course, Best Original Score, Song and Screenplay. The film is the story of two strugglers - Mia, an aspiring actress, and Sebastian, a jazz musician, who are trying to make their dreams come true in the tough city of Los Angeles, the pain and joys they face, and their love story. \nManchester by the Sea \nA film about unbreakable family ties and sacrifice, Manchester by the Sea , focuses on Lee Chandler (played by Casey Affleck), who is forced to return to his past, after his brother’s death leads him to take up his roles as the sole guardian of his 16-year-old nephew. Returning to the hometown he left years ago, Lee is right back in the middle of his old life, his relationship with his estranged wife, and him and his nephew’s struggle to go on without his brother. \nLion \nAnother film based on a true story, Lion shows the journey of Saroo, a child who got separated from his parents as a five-year-old in Calcutta, who lived on the streets, until he was taken to an orphanage and adopted by an Australian family. After he grows up, he longs to find his birth family, and so, uses Google Earth to track them down, from whatever vague memories he has. The brilliant story is adapted from the book about Saroo Brierley’s life, A Long Way Home , written by him with Larry Buttrose. \nMoonlight \nMoonlight , based on the play, In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, by Tarell Alvin McCraney, chronicles three very prominent stages in an African-American boy, Chiron’s life. It shows Chiron’s messed-up childhood, riddled by bullying, peer pressure, and an emotionally-abusive, drug addict mother; his teenage years, where he realises his sexuality and gets arrested; and finally, his adult life, where he becomes a drug addict, but reunites with his teenage lover.
