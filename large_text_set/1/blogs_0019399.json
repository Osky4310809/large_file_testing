Cannabidiol oil has ten medical uses that you might not have known. \nDigestive Aid \nWhen cannabidiol binds to cannabinoid receptors in a person, it stimulates the individual’s appetite . These receptors play a major role in regulating feeding behavior. Some diseases interfere with the appetite to the extent that they can prevent a patient from recovering, and such patients can benefit from this oil. \nMoreover, cannabidiol is good at easing nausea and vomiting. People who are enduring chemotherapy and treatments from serious diseases and are suffering from the conditions can have the most benefit from this compound. \nAnxiety Relief \nCannabidiol can also relieve severe social anxiety. In a 2001 study , researchers investigated the effects of this oil on people with generalized social anxiety disorder and confirmed that it significantly reduces anxiety, discomfort in speech performance and cognitive impairment. While the group that used cannabidiol showed great results, the other group showed higher anxiety, discomfort, and cognitive impairment. \nCancer Spread \nResearch has shown that cannabidiol may have significant protective effect against the development of certain types of cancer. This oil can prevent some types of cancer by inducing the death of tumor cells, controlling and preventing the spread of breast cancer cells, and inhibiting cancer cell growth. According to California Pacific Medical Center , the oil prevents breast cancer cells from traveling to distant tissues by inhibiting ID-1 gene aggression. \nAntipsychotic Relief \nCannabidiol also relieves psychotic symptoms that are associated with schizophrenia, researchers at the University of Cologne in Germany have revealed. Schizophrenia affects approximately 1.1 percent of adults in the U.S., making the demand of this compound high. \nDiabetes Prevention \nIn a recent study , the use of this oil led to the prevention of the development of diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice. This happened because it prevented the production of a cytokine that plays a significant role in many autoimmune diseases. \nInsomnia \nFor many people, this compound is the best for those who want drugs that aid sleep. Unlike most drugs, it does not habit forming. A CDB-heavy strain will help you when you need it most. \nAcne \nThis compound can treat acne, according to the Journal of Clinical Investigation . Scientists used cannabis-derived cannabidiol on the sebaceous glands of a human being and discovered that it acts as an efficient sebostatic and anti-inflammatory agent. \nFibromyalgia \nThe most common treatments for this condition are corticosteroids, opioid pain medications, and anti-inflammatory medications. A 2011 research study indicates that this oil can also treat fibromyalgia. The researchers recruited 56 participants and asked half of them to use cannabidiol and another half to use traditional methods to treat their conditions. All participants who used this oil saw a significant reduction in their symptoms and pain, but the other team did not see much of an improvement. \nCrohn’s Disease \nCannabidiol could be very effective at treating bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. This compound interacts with the systems that regulate gut functions. Its anti-inflammatory abilities inhibit this condition from progressing and ultimately bring a lot of relief to Crohn’s patients. \nCigarette Addiction \nCannabidiol can play a major role in the smoking-withdrawal process. In a double-blind study , 24 smokers received either a placebo or inhaler of cannabidiol, and they were asked to take a puff every time they craved for a cigarette. Over the week, those who were taking the cannabidiol inhaler registered a nearly 40 percent drop in their intake, while the rest saw no change in the number of cigarettes they consumed.
