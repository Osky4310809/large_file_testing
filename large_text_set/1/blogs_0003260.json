Someone was shooting. Two people were shooting at gunpoint,” she claimed, as cited by Haber 7, adding that a strong smell of gunpowder was felt inside the club. \n“Then I fainted. When I woke up my husband was in blood. People were [soaked] in blood,” she said, adding that she managed to push the people away and reach ambulances and police. \nIn the hours after the attack, her husband, Lutfi Uyanık, was being treated in hospital for his injuries. \nA club employee, who was working there as a waiter, said his friend was injured in the attack. The man told Hurriyet that they both managed to avoid death and escape from the club. \n“I brought my friend [to a hospital], we ran outside in panic…There’re a lot of injured people inside. There were 500 to 600 people in the room. I don’t know exactly,” he said. \nAnother shocked witness described her making desperate phone calls until the police arrived and evacuated them. She said some people jumped into the sea to escape the shooting. \n“We watch [reports on terrorist attacks] on TV every day, but it is really bad when it comes to you. How will we live in this country? Bombs will explode, weapons will [be fired],” the witness said .
