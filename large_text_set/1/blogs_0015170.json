A little bumpy, but pretty good,” the skater yelled while gliding across the ice. \nThe camera operator replied, “that’s crazy.” \nThe roads were so slick, even the dog in the video struggled to find its footing and slid across the icy driveway. \nSimilar videos popped up across Minnesota. Local hockey writer Jess Myers tweeted a video of his son Jacob skating on the street with the caption, \"How bad was the ice storm in MSP last night? It provided one HS hockey player a literal road to the Stanley Cup.\" \n“Yeah, that’s our bare asphalt street and those are hockey skates! So, if you don’t have to drive, I suggest you don’t,\" Myers said on the video. \"Just my two cents. Nice work, Jacob. Just getting a little extra hockey practice in … in the street.” \nThe Gophers and Badgers kick off the Border Battle Friday night at 7 p.m. on Fox Sports North. \nEnjoy the videos: How Wisco kids get so good at hockeyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ @BadgerMHockey @UWSPWHockey @trishdakins pic.twitter.com/jrLFzEXpfl — Joe Piskula (@skoolz43) January 17, 2017 How bad was the ice storm in MSP last night?
