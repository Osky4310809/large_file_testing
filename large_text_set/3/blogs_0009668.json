The rappers' mutual dislike got heated last month when Nicki seemingly dissed Remy in her song \"Make Love,\" prompting Remy to clap back with not one, but TWO diss tracks that took aim at Nicki's personal life. Remy even dragged Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus into the fray as a reminder of Nicki's past feuds. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Nicki isn't one to sit idly by as someone insults her, so late last week she released a clap-back to the clap-back called \"No Frauds,\" with pals Drake and Lil Wayne. \"What type of bum b**** shoot a friend over a rack? What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?\" Nicki raps, a clear dig at Remy's 2007 arrest and conviction for shooting an ex-friend over suspicions of stolen money. After the track dropped, Nicki noticed Selena lip-syncing the song on a friend's Instagram. Meanwhile, Ariana — Nicki's collaborator on tracks like \"Side to Side\" and \"Bang Bang\" — posted on Insta that she was jamming out to Nicki's other surprise release, \"Regret in Your Tears,\" which many believe to be directed at Nicki's ex, Meek Mill. Most Popular A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Mar 10, 2017 at 1:41pm PST In case you weren't aware, Meek got a shout-out in Remy's initial diss track, with Remy claiming that he told her personal details of Nicki's rumored plastic surgery. So it makes sense that Ari's support of \"Regret in Your Tears\" means she's on Team Nicki. Nicki shared Selena's lip-syncing vid on her official Instagram over the weekend, thanking Sel and Ari (as well as Tinashe and Jhene Aiko) for their support. \"What's funny about this, is that all 4 of them look so sweet & innocent to me but they're all low key savages I guess,\" Nicki wrote in her caption. \"Didn't expect this but love u girls so much for reppin.\" A post shared by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on Mar 10, 2017 at 4:14pm PST More from Seventeen:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T04:42:17.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
