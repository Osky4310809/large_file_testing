Love the variety of characters and gameplay. Only thing I don't like is that while I'm playing - I'll receive messages from other apps like Facebook and when I'm trying to play the game I'll click on the pop up and it'll take me out of the app entirely; messing my flow up in the match. Not a HUGE problem, but something I wish could be resolved. Oh and I hate how you have to wait for one pack to open before opening the others. Sooo much time being wasted. BUT. If you haven't tried the game out, you should do so! Great game by Apathy83 This is the perfect mobile game. The rounds last 3 minutes each so you can play one round quick. And quite possibly the best thing about this game is you can play as many games as you want! There is no special item you use to play a round so you don't have to wait for them to refresh or spend money to reset them to play more. I hope in the future they will add a bigger variety of unit cards to choose from. They have quite a few heroes to play as though. I recommend this game to any Star Wars fan and I also recommend this to any clash royal fan since the gameplay is similar but you have more control over units and better graphics and you get your own hero unit to control as well so imo it's better than clash royal because it takes a good Mobile game formula and makes it better.Play this game it really is fun. Fun, but may be too slow for some by One-armed Harmon I enjoy the game so far but 20 minutes into playing it I noticed you have to wait 9 hours to unlock a silver pack! That's reduced to 4.5 hours with a booster. Even the bronze packs which provide nearly nothing valuable take 3 hours or an hour and a half to open with booster. So right off the bat you'll either be spending money to reduce the wait time to open a SINGLE card pack at a time or playing this game until you're 60 years old because the card pack grind is real.
