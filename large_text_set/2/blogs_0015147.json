But the claimed figures are promising, and SCG founder (and father of its namesake) Jim Glickenhaus certainly isn’t known for fooling around. \n-After turning his Lola T70 Can-Am car into a street-legal grocery getter, Glickenhaus commissioned Pininfarina to make a Ferrari Enzo faster and prettier. Then his crew evolved that car, the Pininfarina Ferrari P4/5 , into a racing car designed to be successful at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. All of which led to SCG’s in-house-developed race car, the 003 Competizione, shown below.\n- \n-Like the P4/5 and the P4/5C, the 003C was designed by former Pininfarina special projects engineer Paolo Garella and handbuilt by Manifattura Automobili Torino in Italy. After competing in and completing two Nürburgring 24s and several other races, the company launched a customer racing program —and continued prepping a road-legal and race-ready version of the 003 called the Competizione Stradale , a car intended to be able to be driven to the track and converted for racing before reversing the changes and driving home again. Then that car begat the 003 Stradale , which SCG says will be the fastest ever roadgoing car on the Nürburgring Nordschleife.\n-Based on its own telemetry gathered at the iconic track, SCG is predicting that the 003S will circle the ’Ring in a staggering six minutes, 30 seconds—on Dunlop street-legal tires. For the record, that’s roughly 27 seconds faster than the current production-car record holder, the Porsche 918 Spyder .\n-How can that be possible? For starters, the Stradale weighs less than the competition car, coming in at a claimed 2866 pounds with fuel. It also has 250 more horsepower than the race car, with the BMW-based 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 producing 800 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque. SCG also says that the Stradale will be the most capable car on the road in terms of lateral grip, capable of generating 2.00 g—again, on Dunlop’s street rubber.\n- \n- - Road in the Forest: How the P4/5C Racer Fared at the Nürburgring 24 Hours - The Un-Ferrari: We Go Behind the Scenes during P4/5 Competizione Testing - First Look: Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus SCG 003 Stradale - -Further estimates include a sprint to 60 mph of less than three seconds, a top speed in excess of 217 mph, and more than 1550 pounds of downforce at speeds above 155 mph. You might be wondering how comfortable an FIA-spec carbon-fiber monocoque can be on the road. With its padded leather seats, automatic climate control, video feeds for visibility, and electrically adjustable shock absorbers, the Stradale isn’t given over totally to speed. But there’s no doubt the million-dollar car is intended to go fast, and we look forward to finding out soon whether the car can put up the numbers SCG says it can.\n- \n- A version of this story originally appeared on Road & Track . \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:04:13.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
