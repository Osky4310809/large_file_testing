While there were some contestants on the first season of the show that had previously debuted, on this second season, the number of previously debuted contestants has jumped significantly to 27. \nWhile “Produce 101 Season 2” will give trainees who have never debuted the chance to do so, it could also be an important stepping stone for idols who have already debuted to the popularity and attention that they were unable to garner before. \nSome of the most significant of these previously debuted contestants include NU’EST’s Baekho, JR, Ren, and Minhyun from Pledis Entertainment. The group debuted six years ago and has a large number of fans across Korea and Japan, which made their participation in the show quite controversial. \nAnother significant participant is O&O Entertainment’s Jang Moon Bok. He made his television debut on “Superstar K,” and then proceeded to debut as a rapper last July. He is already a favorite among netizens. \nBrave Entertainment’s Samuel Kim has also joined the race. He is a very young participant, born in 2002, and he debuted in 2015 as part of the group 1PUNCH with the stage name Punch. He has an interracial background, which has led some fans to compare him to the winner of the first season, Jeon Somi. \nOther participants of the show include members of One Voices, JJCC, and BTL, among others, as well as musical actors and small screen actors. \nWhat are your thoughts on previously debuted idols participating in the show?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T12:04:47.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
