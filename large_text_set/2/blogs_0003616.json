Brady hit Danny Amendola for a two-point conversion to tie the score at 28 with 57 seconds left and send the Super Bowl into overtime for the first time in its 51-year history. \n“It just was an avalanche,” Brady said of the momentum change. \nThey finally found the end zone on a 5-yard pass from Brady to White with 2:06 left in the third quarter, but Stephen Gostkowski clunked the extra-point kick off the right upright to leave the score at 28-9. A 33-yard field goal by Gostkowski made it 28-12 with 9:44 left in the game. \nStill, it seemed the Falcons were in control. Until . . . Super Bowl Super Bowl LI: Julian Edelman's wild catch \nDont’a Hightower sacked Ryan and forced a fumble with 8:24 left in regulation to set up the Patriots at the Falcons’ 25, and Brady hit Amendola for a 6-yard touchdown. White ran in the two-point conversion to make it 28-20 with 5:56 left. \n  \nThe Falcons seemed poised to run out the clock even then, as Ryan responded with a short pass to Devonta Freeman for a gain of 39 and a 27-yard pass to Julio Jones along the sideline that seemed destined to join Tyree’s and Mario Manningham’s in New Englanders’ nightmares. But the Falcons had to punt, giving Brady the ball at the 9 with 3:30 left. \nAfter two incompletions, he hit Chris Hogan for 16 yards from his own end zone to kick-start the tying drive. The Falcons had 52 seconds left and no timeouts and were unable to get in scoring position before the end of regulation. \n“We ran out of gas,” said Falcons coach Dan Quinn, whose team dominated early. \nAfter a scoreless first quarter, the Falcons turned a pair of takeaways into 14 points and took a 21-0 lead. Rookie linebacker Deion Jones stripped LeGarrette Blount of the ball less than a minute into the second quarter, and it was recovered by Alford. From there, the league’s top-scoring offense went to work with a pair of passes to Jones for a combined 42 yards and a 5-yard touchdown run by Freeman. Neil Best Best: Fox provides insight, class during Super game \nThe Falcons forced a three-and-out before Ryan hit tight end Austin Hooper for a 19-yard touchdown with 8:48 left in the half to go ahead 14-0. \nThe Patriots looked as if they might be able to land some points and stop the momentum with a 15-play drive to the Falcons’ 23. But on third-and-6, Brady was picked off by Alford, and he returned it 82 yards for the second-longest pick-6 in Super Bowl history. \nThat made it 21-0 with 2:21 left in the half. It was the first return for points against the Patriots all season and Brady’s first career postseason pick-6. \nThe Patriots kicked a field goal with two seconds left in the half to make it 21-3, but the Falcons marched 85 yards to make it 28-3 early in the third. Taylor Gabriel’s 35-yard reception was the big gain on the drive, which ended with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Tevin Coleman with 8:31 left in the third. \nIt was a lead that seemed impossible for the Patriots to overcome. Which is what made it all so great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:00:09.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
