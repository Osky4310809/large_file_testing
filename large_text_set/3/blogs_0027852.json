Photo: Metro UK \nThe London terror attacker Khalid Masood’s original birth name was Adrian Russell Ajao, born on Christmas Day 1964, the Metropolitan Police revealed today. \nThe name, Ajao, is his stepdad’s surname. \nA 75-year-old pensioner – who last night became the fifth person to die in the Westminster attack when his life support was switched off with permission of his next of kin – has been named as Leslie Rhodes , from Streatham in South London. \nPolice issued an urgent appeal this morning for anyone who knew Masood to contact them – especially if they know who his associates were. \nCrucially they want to find out if anyone else was involved in the plot to attack Parliament and kill people on Westminster Bridge on Wednesday. \nActing Deputy Commissioner Mark Rowley said at a press conference this morning: “Yesterday we named the dead terrorist as Khalid Masood – we stated he had a number of aliases – we now know his birth name was Adrian Russell Ajao.” \nHe revealed the “fast paced” investigation has been called Operation Classific –“involving hundreds of officers from across the counter terrorism network.” \nPolice still don’t know if Masood was a ‘lone wolf’ attacker or working alongside/influenced by others – despite Islamic State having claimed he was one of their “soldiers”. \nMasood, 52, originally from Kent but living in Birmingham, was not the subject of any prior ongoing investigation. \nHe is also known to have used the name Adrian Elms and Khalid Chowdhury – and was once investigated by Mi5 for violent extremism but was discounted as a threat. \nRowley continued: “Our investigation focuses on understanding his motivation, preparation and his associates.” \nSources: The SUN, Metro", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:36:53.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
