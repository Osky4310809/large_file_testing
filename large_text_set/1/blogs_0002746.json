Park, who owns Ohana as well as Sopressata in Silver Lake, says that his poke concept will be flipping over to a new address inside the food hall at Fig at 7th. That move will become official sometime in March, but until then the existing Downtown Historic Core space is already soft open once again as Hero Shop. So what can one expect at the reborn business? Lots of things, actually, including a couple of breakfast banh mi sandwiches available daily starting at 9 a.m. You’ll also find a slew of inexpensive lunch sandwiches (each $6 or less), plus sub-$10 rice bowls all day long. What’s more, Park says that each sandwich will offer a chance to give back, with a portion of proceeds going to the Union Rescue Mission nearby. The full opening menu is below. If you head to the restaurant’s website, you’ll actually find a manifesto of sorts on the difference between Hero Shop 1.0 and this new round, with Park saying: Originally we aimed to be a ‘destination’ banh mi shop. We sold ‘chef-driven’ banh mi’s, and sold them at prices not normally associated with banh mi’s. And while the sandwiches were delicious, they ignored the very spirit of what a banh mi is … And hopefully this time around, we can effectively reach the people right here, our neighbors. And provide something good (and good-priced) for you. Hero Shop has softly reopened today, keeping weekday hours from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. They’re closed on Sunday, but will do all-day hours on Saturday from noon to 9 p.m. as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:47:17.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
