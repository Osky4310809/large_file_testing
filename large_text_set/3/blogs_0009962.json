Now, these polar opposite neighbors take things to the next level when Viv needs help hiding her latest high-end haul. Turns out even Westport’s wealthiest women sometimes pay a price. In this sneak peek look at the upcoming American Housewife episode, “Other People’s Marriages,” Katie is stunned to find out that her wealthy neighbor has to ask permission from her husband before she shops. In fact, she has to ask permission for just about everything she does because her controlling husband Alan (played by Jay Mohr) gets “cranky” if she does things without his consent. Katie agrees to help Viv hide her stash of Henri Bendel bags, but not before reminding her that marriage is supposed to be 50/50 — or at least 70/30, like the Ottos’. Of course, this is American Housewife , so Katie’s marital meddling will surely come back to bite her. But at least she gets some leather pants out of the deal. American Housewife airs Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. on ABC. Watch clips and full episodes of American Housewife on Yahoo View .
