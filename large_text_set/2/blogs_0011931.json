King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 8 hours ago 12 \nA few months back in Italy, Josh Klinghoffer caught the attention of the music community by filming the crowd with his phone instead of playing the solo part during \" Californication \" as a protest towards the smartphone-armed crowd. \nAnd now, the RHCP guitarist told Devo Brown that the thing that bugs him the most is people disregarding the crowd behind them while filming. \nHe said: \"I don't look out very often, and I've been at shows wanting to take a quick video, but it's this [mimics person standing with phone up for a long time] - it's blatant disregard for the person behind you! One quick moment - sure, but there are people who do it the entire time.\" \nThe footage of Josh filming the crowd is available below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:20:28.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
