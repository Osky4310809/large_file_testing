The Silverado offers strong powertrains, serious hauling capability, good real-world fuel economy, and a plethora of features, but it comes up short on ride and seat comfort. Its top 6.2-liter V-8 tows the most in the class and wins our highway fuel-economy test. Its brawn is balanced by looks that mean business, handsome interior trim, user-friendly infotainment, and 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity. What’s New for 2017? \nThe 2017 Silverado differs little from the refreshed 2016 model . For 2017, there are improved towing figures, where the Silverado comes out on top of its class. It also gains notable safety equipment such as Chevy’s Teen Driver system and forward automatic braking. Teen Driver allows parents to monitor how well their kids are driving. The optional forward automatic-braking system slows the vehicle when it senses an impending collision at speeds between 5 and 37 mph. Standard Feature Highlights \n• Bed-entry-assist steps and grab handles• Air conditioning• Power door locks Trims and Options We’d Choose \nBecause we want a truck that can haul lots of people and an abundance of stuff, we’d choose the LT Z71 crew cab with the standard bed (6.6 feet). The $47,305 LT Z71 package comes with: \n• 355-hp 5.3-liter V-8• Z71 off-road suspension with Rancho monotube shocks• 8.0-inch touchscreen with Chevy MyLink, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto compatibility• EZ-Lift and Lower tailgate \nWe’d also add either the All Star or Texas editions ($1305 each, differing only in badging), which make the Silverado even more comfortable. All Star and Texas trims include: \n• Power-adjustable driver’s seat", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:51:16.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
