Steny Hoyer didn't say that he was going to boycott the inauguration, as several other Democrats have decided to do. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) Hoyer will attend inauguration By Robert King â€¢ 1/15/17 3:13 PM   \nThe second ranking Democrat in the House won't join civil rights icon John Lewis' boycott of the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump , but said he understands his colleague's concerns with Trump. \nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was speaking at a rally to save Obamacare when a rallygoer interrupted him, calling for Hoyer to boycott the inauguration. The comments come after Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., questioned Donald Trump 's legitimacy and announced a boycott of the inauguration on Jan. 20. \nHoyer said that he \"understands my friend John Lewis.\" \nHowever, Hoyer told the Washington Examiner afterwards that he was not going to boycott the inauguration, as roughly 20 other House Democrats have decided to do. \n  \n\"He is being sworn in and I am a leader in the equal branch of government,\" he said. \nHoyer added he believes that Trump represents the \"minority of Americans and not the majority.\" \n\"I think John Lewis is correct to make a statement by not being there how concerned we are about policies he is proposing,\" he said. \nHowever, Hoyer didn't agree with Lewis' statement questioning the legitimacy of Trump's presidency. \n\"I wouldn't say it that way but I understand what he is saying,\" Hoyer said.
