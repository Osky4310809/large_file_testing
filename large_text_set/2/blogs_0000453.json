The 1989 singer shared a video rehearsal of herself performing an acoustic rendition of \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" -- her new jam with Zayn Malik -- ahead of her DIRECTV NOW Super Saturday Night performance in Houston, Texas. WATCH: Taylor Swift and Gigi Hadid Can't Keep Their Cool While Hearing 'I Don't Wanna Live Forever' on the Radio Watch the video below to see the 26-year-old singer strum the guitar and bring a toned-down feeling to the sultry track. Swift's performance on Saturday is part of a multi-year deal with AT&T, and comes as fans clamor for a follow-up to her massively successful 1989 album (this past October, the pop star didn't release an album, falling significantly off her every two years schedule for the first time in her career). And we can only assume Swift is ready to get back at it soon, given how the multi-GRAMMY winning artist reacted to hearing \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" on the radio with friend Gigi Hadid. Watch their adorable video below. RELATED SLIDESHOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:40:10.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
