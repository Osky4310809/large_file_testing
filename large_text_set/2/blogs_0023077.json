A new study says your cat definitely won’t make you crazy Even though we dearly love our little feline friends, the various conversations around cats causing psychosis in their owners (especially children and pregnant women) have been pretty scary. Say it ain’t so! Well actually, it ain’t.\nA new study led by Dr. Francesca Solmi from University College London has found that cats don’t cause mental illness after all . PHEW. The study, published in Psychological Medicine , studied many different households where children grew up with cats and found no evidence to suggest that cats are to blame for abnormal behavior .\n“The message for cat owners is clear: There is no evidence that cats pose a risk to children’s mental health. In our study, initial unadjusted analyses suggested a small link between cat ownership and psychotic symptoms at age 13, but this turned out to be due to other factors,” Solmi said in a statement about the study. The toxoplasma gondii parasite is indeed real and infects cats (and humans), but the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention note that our immune system is strong enough to keep the parasite from causing illness. SO, it looks like there is nothing to be overly concerned about.\nvia GIPHY “Once we controlled for factors such as household over-crowding and socioeconomic status, the data showed that cats were not to blame. Previous studies reporting links between cat ownership and psychosis simply failed to adequately control for other possible explanations,” Solmi added in the statement. \nvia GIPHY To be on the safe side, women who are pregnant still shouldn’t have much interaction with a kitty litter box — as their feces could be contaminated with the parasite and pose a risk of birth defects. Pregnant women are usually very careful about that kind of thing anyway, so it’s not really anything radically new.\nYAY CATS. Now excuse us while we go find the nearest cat and smother it with love.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:22:31.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
