It can be hard to stand out from the crowd, so sometimes brewers have to get a little crazy. Like brewing beer with hundreds of pounds of Oreos crazy.\nA little over a week ago, The Veil Brewing Company in Richmond, Virginia started serving up a very special beer they call Hornswoggler. It’s a milk stout with plenty of chocolately kick… and little bits of frosting floating in it.\nYes, really! How does it get there? It got absorbed into the mix after the primary fermentation is complete. When Veil was ready to condition (when the yeast finishes its work, and the beer becomes carbonated) Hornswoggler they poured it over a giant mound of Oreo cookies.\nVeil’s photo up top only tells part of the story. Here’s a tweet from Beer Street Journal that gives you a much better idea what beer that was conditioned over a vat of cookies looks like in a glass:\nThe Veil Brewing takes dessert beer to the next level. ‘Hornswoggler’ Choco milk stout, aged on Oreo cookies. There’s even icing chunks pic.twitter.com/z9FOqjRsQW\n— Beer Street Journal (@BeerSTJournal) January 30, 2017\nAccording to Veil, Hornswoggler has been quite popular, and their first batch is on the verge of selling out. Apparently, Oreos and beer go together like peanut butter and jelly.\nEither that or when one of the top three new craft breweries in the U.S. turns out something this unexpected people just can’t resist the urge to see whether it’s genius or madness at work. I’m going with genius. I mean, hey, there’s beer to drink in the shower … why not beer for dessert?", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BeerSTJournal/status/825868244275822593", "https://www.facebook.com/theveilbrewing", "https://t.co/z9FOqjRsQW"], "published": "2017-02-02T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:45:06.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
