Daniel Johnston contributed “a handful of his drawings” from his “one-and-only graphic novel” called Space Ducks: An Infinite Comic Book of Musical Greatness . Matt Furie will be showing a series of drawings from his upcoming coloring book. \nFor Van Patten, hosting the show in Long Beach was important because he wants to make sure there’s a space for artists not shown in museums. While Long Beach art establishments like the Museum of Latin American Art (MOLAA) definitely offer a space for contemporary art, it’s unlikely you’d find something like the trippy style of Jay Torres there. MADE by Millworks makes sense as a venue for this show since the store focuses on local goods — more than 150 of them, to be exact. \n“One of the main problems Long Beach has is that there are a bunch of talented artists but very few cool venues for exhibits,” writes Van Patten. “Made by Millworks is a boutique in the front, but has a huge exhibition area in the back that I thought would be perfect for this type of show. Rather than booking one of the many cool warehouse galleries in Los Angeles, [I] thought it would be cool to highlight Long Beach.” \nAnother goal Van Patten kept in mind was to encourage L.A. art lovers to visit an area different from their usual art haunts.
