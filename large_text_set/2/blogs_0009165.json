Now, They're Angry DeVos Was Confirmed. Share Share Tweet \nBack in November of 2013, then Sen. Harry Reid effectively killed the filibuster for federal appointments, meaning that only a simple majority was needed to confirm an appointment. Reid even gloated about it on Twitter, saying that filibuster reform \"had to be done.\" Thanks to all of you who encouraged me to consider filibuster reform. It had to be done. — Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) November 21, 2013 \nAt the time, scores of progressives were utterly tickled by him and were thrilled at his actions. Thank you for your leadership RT @SenatorReid Thanks to all of you who encouraged me to consider filibuster reform. It had to be done. — Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) November 21, 2013 Kudos! RT @SenatorReid : Thanks to all of you who encouraged me to consider filibuster reform. It had to be done. — Daniel P. (@DanielinPDX) November 21, 2013 Bless you! It had to be done. RT @SenatorReid Thanks to all of you who encouraged me to consider filibuster reform. It had to be done. — I voted for Hillary (@AprilStearns) November 22, 2013 “ @SenatorReid : Thanks to all of you who encouraged me to consider filibuster reform. It had to be done.”Thank you . Enough was enough. — Tim (@VlanTrunk) November 23, 2013 \nNow, those very same people may want to take back their praise of Reid's filibuster reform. Namely, because it resulted in Betsy DeVos being confirmed as Education Secretary. #DeVos never attended, taught at, or sent kids to public school, spent millions undermining them. America can do better for Secretary of Ed — Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) February 7, 2017 DeVos can’t even correctly name children with disabilities, let alone educate them https://t.co/0NC9JaFkZ2 My son has Autism. #DumpDevos — Karen Murphy (@MDHillRaiser) February 7, 2017 But, to keep right wing extremists in power, we need to make sure schools are not improved & that more kids get christianist educations. https://t.co/YkcMKuiK2X", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:00:15.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
