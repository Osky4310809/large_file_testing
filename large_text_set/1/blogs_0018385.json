(Photo: Courtesy of Instagram/_naomiharris_) More Gwyneth Paltrow is not one to shy away from discourse about her vagina. She’s been credited with starting the Brazilian bikini wax craze years ago by waxing rhapsodic about her favorite pubic hair groomers in New York City. More recently she extolled the virtues of vaginal steaming and, in her controversial newsletter GOOP, a 24-karat gold-plated vibrator . The actress-turned-lifestyle guru’s latest nether-regions obsession is “jade eggs for your yoni,” as she puts it in one of GOOP’s latest installments. The eggs, made of actual jade, are meant to be inserted into the vaginal canal to “increase chi, orgasms, vaginal muscle tone, hormonal balance, and feminine energy in general,” says GOOP. Paltrow came to find out about the $66 stones through her wellness guru, Shiva Rose, who has been practicing with them for seven years. Women are instructed to clench the egg inside their vaginas for extended periods of time, as many Chinese queens and concubines used to do to “to stay in shape for emperors,” says the site.

Dr. Jen Gunter wrote an open letter on her blog to express her outrage and concern over Paltrow’s endorsement of the product. “read the post on GOOP and all I can tell you is it is the biggest load of garbage I have read on your site since vaginal steaming . It’s even worse than claiming bras cause cancer . But hey, you aren’t one to let facts get in the way of profiting from snake oil,” Dr. Gunter wrote. Out of hand, she dismisses the claim that jade eggs can help with hormonal imbalances, calling this “biologically impossible.” She blasts GOOP’s recommendation that women both walk around and sleep with jade eggs in places, as “your pelvic floor muscles are not meant to contract continuously.” Dr. Gunter compares the constant flexing of pelvic floor muscles to the constant flexing of any muscle, noting that this is bound to lead to great pain. “Imagine how your biceps muscle (and then your shoulders and then your back) might feel if you walked around all day flexed holding a barbell? Right, now imagine your pelvic floor muscles doing this,” Dr. Gunter writes.

It could be a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis or even the potentially deadly toxic shock syndrome.” In her take-down, Dr. Gunter acknowledges that Kegel exercises, which are known to strengthen pelvic muscles and help facilitate orgasms, can be effective when done the right way — and holding jade eggs in the vaginal canal is not the right way. In fact, she writes, “Overenthusiastic Kegel exercises or incorrectly done Kegel exercises are a cause of pelvic pain and pain with sex in my practice.” For women who do want to use devices to improve their Kegels, Dr. Gunter suggests “using weights made with medical grade silicone or plastic and to not wear them for long periods of time. Kegel exercises are not just about the contraction, the relaxation phase is just as important.” In addition, Dr. Gunter was baffled as what Shiva Rose meant when she said that practicing with jade eggs can “feminine energy.” She wrote, “I’m a gynecologist and I don’t know what that is!? How does one test for it? Organically sourced, fair trade urine pH sticks coming soon to GOOP for $77 I presume?”. The doctor was also offended at GOOP’s assertion that reproductive organs are “where many women access their intuition, their power, and their wisdom.” She retorted, “Terminology aside, the vulva, vagina, cervix, and uterus are not intuition repositories and neither are they sources of “power” or “wisdom.” If fact, I find that assertion insulting. Do you really mean a woman who does not have a uterus is less effective? Is a woman without a vagina less intelligent? Is a woman who had a vulvectomy due to cancer less creative?”. Dr. Gunter claims the only thing Paltrow and Shiva Rose got correct in their article is “to check with your doctor before using one.” She offered some “free advice” in the form of this simple pearl of wisdom: “Don’t use vaginal jade eggs.” Let’s keep in touch!
