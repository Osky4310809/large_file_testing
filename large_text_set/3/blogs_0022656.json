Mall owner Madison Marquette said the multimillion-dollar renovation will result in a new \"grand entrance\" facing the booming South Lake Union neighborhood, which has added thousands of jobs and residents in recent years. Additional shop and restaurant space is planned, and the common areas will be remodeled. This rendering shows the new entry planned for Pacific Place shopping center in downtown… more Gensler The new entry also will look out toward Amazon's new high-rise campus and the site where the 45-story Hyatt Regency is rising . The Hyatt Regency site is next to the planned $1.6 billion addition to the Washington State Convention Center, which is scheduled to start construction later this year. Architecture firm Gensler is designing the redevelopment. Construction is scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2017 with the first phase opening in the fall of 2018, Madison Marquette said. Madison Marquette's news release did not say who the general contractor will be. Washington, D.C.-based Madison Marquette bought Pacific Place , 600 Pine St., three years ago for $271 million, and last fall the company acquired the mall's underground parking garage for $87 million . At the time of the garage acquisition, the company said it was planning a complete remodel, though details were not announced until Tuesday. The development of Pacific Place was a key part of the 2000 renaissance of downtown Seattle. The vertical mall occupies a full block and is connected by a skybridge to the recently remodeled Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) flagship store. Pacific Place has more than 50 shops and restaurants, including Barney’s New York, Tiffany & Co. , Kate Spade New York, Coach, Lululemon Athletica, AMC Pacific Place 11 and a Din Tai Fung restaurant.
