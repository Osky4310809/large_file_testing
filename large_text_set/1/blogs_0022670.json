With an €80 million offer, I would be thinking about [club president] Reinhard Rauball and [sporting director] Michael Zorc - if we had one [an offer], we would have to get together with Pierre-Emerick [to discuss it]. \nFerguson: Man Utd are now mirroring Mourinho \n\"We always have to differentiate between situations where there is such an offer, but we have no pressure... I would prefer it if no offer came. \n\"[He] is definitely good enough to go to an even bigger club. There are only a few, but I'm glad to read that it's a good idea to go to Barcelona,\" he added, perhaps referring to Aubameyang's recent claim that Dortmund are not on the same level as Barca, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid.
