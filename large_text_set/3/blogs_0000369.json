Photo: YouTube \nCord cutters just got another option for getting their TV fix over the internet. \nGoogle-owned YouTube revealed today that is launching a new streaming TV service that will offer customers a bundle of channels from broadcast and cable networks for $35. But it might not come with all the channels you want. \nThe new service, dubbed YouTube TV , is aimed at mobile users. YouTube expects most subscribers will watch most of the shows and movies on their iPhones and iPads. You’ll also be able to watch it on other devices though like laptops, TVs and Google Chromecast. \nExecutives at YouTube say the basic package for YouTube TV will include about three dozen channels. Access to the four broadcast networks — FOX, ABC, CBS and NBC — is included in the skinny buddle. Subscribers will also get networks such as ESPN, Bravo, and Fox News. \nPriced at $35 per month with no contract, YouTube TV is set to compete against the likes of Sling, DirecTV Now, Sony Vue and Hulu. Unlike some of those services though, YouTube TV won’t offer channels from companies like Viacom, AMC or Time Warner. That means you won’t get able to watch shows from TNT, MTV, Comedy Central, CNN, or AMC. \nYouTube TV will pack some features you can’t find on its competitors. Users will get access to a cloud DVR with unlimited storage space. Shows will auto-delete from your DVR after 9 months. \nThe basic package comes with six accounts so everyone in your family can get a personalized experience. YouTube also says it will use Google’s AI to power a recommendations system. \nAn official launch date for YouTube TV hasn’t been given. The company says it plans to launch the service as a stand-alone app later this spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:40:46.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
