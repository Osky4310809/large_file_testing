Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports \nThe 2017 NFL season doesn’t kick off for another five months, but Rob Gronkowski already is raring to go. \nThe New England Patriots tight end, who missed the final two months of the 2016 campaign after undergoing back surgery in early December, fired off a tweet Sunday night saying he “literally can’t wait to compete again and play ball.” \nHaving fun and all these days but literally can't wait to compete again and play ball. Miss it.

During the five games he was a full participant in, he surpassed 100 receiving yards three times. \nThis article first appeared on NESN.com and was syndicated with permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T18:48:27.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
