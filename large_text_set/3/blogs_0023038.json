The elder drug lord’s partner? Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman , who escaped from Mexican maximum security prisons twice before finally being extradited to the United States. \nA Mexican official confirmed that the escapees had avoided transfer to maximum security federal prisons, according to ABC News . It is not difficult to see the hand of corruption keeping all five together on their home turf of Sinaloa, among the most corrupt states in an infamously corrupt country. \nThe court system blocked repeated attempts to transfer the five to the greater security of federal prisons, said Cristobal Castaneda, assistant secretary of public safety in northern Sinaloa state.   \nLike his father, Esparragoza Monzon is known for keeping a low profile and could be anywhere. His father was rumored to have died of a heart attack in 2014 but the report has never been confirmed, according to the U.K. Daily Mail . \nThere is no question that a loose border benefits Mexico. Otherwise they’d have enforced it long ago. Drugs and people flow north; money flows south. Mexico can ill afford to lose the approximately $27 billion in remittances and heaven-knows-how-much-else in drug money that crossed the border in 2016. \nMoney from the U.S. — just the remittances — represent about 8 percent of Mexico’s annual budget. Add to that the profits from drugs and you don’t have to connect many dots to see why these criminals were allowed to escape. As the saying goes, follow the money. \nMemo to President Trump: We need that wall NOW.
