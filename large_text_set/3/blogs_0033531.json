CREDIT: CNN screengrab On Thursday, the New York Times reported that two White House officials passed House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) the intelligence reports he used in a clumsy attempt to validate President Trump’s wiretapping claim . Those officials are “Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsel’s Office and formerly worked on the staff of the House Intelligence Committee.”\nEven though we know Nunes was on the White House grounds the night before he held a news conference about the intelligence reports, Press Secretary Sean Spicer has consistently professed ignorance about Nunes’ information and where he got it. Last week, he suggested the White House wasn’t the source, telling the press corps the idea the White House would pass information to Nunes and then Nunes would turn around and share that information with Trump “doesn’t really seem to make a ton of sense.”\nReport: White House officials were Devin Nunes’ ‘wiretap’ sources after all \nBut in light of the Times’ bombshell report, a clip from Spicer’s Wednesday press conference is noteworthy.\nWhile criticizing reporters for pointing out the White House’s hypocrisy in being fine with leaks that appear to be favorable to them while decrying all others , Spicer said, “When the information that is occurring now, which is two individuals who are properly cleared — or three or whoever he met with, I don’t know — that, they are sharing stuff that is entirely legal with the appropriate clearances, and then there is an obsession on the process.”\nYesterday, Sean Spicer accidentally revealed that he KNEW there were TWO leakers at the White House feeding Nunes info. https://t.co/yZydbfJyi8 \n —  @JuddLegum \nOne day later we learned that, indeed, two individuals with the proper clearance were reportedly “sharing stuff” with Nunes on the White House grounds last week.\nDespite his apparent slip on Wednesday and the subsequent Times report, Spicer still wouldn’t confirm or deny that the White House was the source of Nunes’ information during his Thursday news conference.\nQ: Wasn't the White House obviously involved in Nunes getting the info? Spicer: [long, long pause] I can't get into that. https://t.co/3OhBhg6a43 \n —  @MattGertz \nWhile controversy swirls around Nunes and the White House, Spicer on Thursday expressed continued confidence in the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Trump and Russia, and dismissed calls for an independent probe.\n“I think this is being done in a responsible way people are [discussing] what they know at an appropriate classification level and information is being shared,” he said.\nDid Spicer accidentally confirm the White House leak of intelligence reports to Nunes? was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:07:43.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
