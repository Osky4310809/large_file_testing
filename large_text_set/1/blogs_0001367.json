The last 12 months gave many of us far more cause for sadness than celebration, so we don’t really envy Skillz’s task of revisiting it all for his annual “Rap Up.” \nThis year, the Michigan-born, Virginia-based rapper managed to include just about everything we went through, from Cam Newton choking the Super Bowl, to “ Becky with the good hair ” to the speculation about Gucci Mane being a clone . \nSkillz also reserved a few subtle jabs for the new generation of rappers: “Panda was a hit but we couldn’t understand the words … These young’uns keep mumblin’, I guess y’all call that rappin,'” continuing, “And rap got weird, should we be concerned? Young Thug in a dress, Yung Joc got a perm .” \nOf course, it gets even deeper once Skillz turns his attention to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, who he says took the biggest L of the year. \nOur personal favorite observation might be his take on smartphones, though: “Get an iPhone with no headphone cord or get a Galaxy … and go and meet the Lord.” \nPut this on and get reminiscing about a year that can’t end soon enough. \nCheck out DX’s 2016 year-end awards here .
