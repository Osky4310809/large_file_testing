I want to make sure this never happens to anybody else's kids, and if that starts with taking down this one group, I'll make that my life's mission.\"\nAdding:\n\"If we don't stand up and do anything about it now, who knows if the next kid this happens to, maybe they don't get to come home. Maybe this doesn't get to have a happy ending.\"\nThus far neither the people who streamed the video to Facebook, nor the dozens of viewers, have been officially identified.\nWe'll keep you updated as we learn more.\n[ Image via Facebook . ] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:04:36.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
