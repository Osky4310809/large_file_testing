The four days were a mad house as fashion dripped everywhere from the shows to the streets. Bollywood stars dropped by, designers displayed their winning collections, gender fluidity was brought to the forefront, people wore what they wanted without any apprehensions, models almost tripped on runways, people danced to the live music, someone broke their heel and someone else lost their jacket ... Fashion Week was nuts, as always. While there's always a lot beauty surrounding us, this year, we bumped into a number of stunning faces; faces that had their own stories to tell.
