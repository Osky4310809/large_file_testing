Fitted with snow tyres, Marquez takes the X-ADV on the snow and ice in the famed Austrian ski resort. \nUsing the liquid-cooled parallel-twin 745 cc engine from the Honda Integra and NC-series scooters, the X-ADV mates the power plant with dual-purpose styling, with taller suspension. Claimed to produce 53 hp at 6,250 rpm and 67.7 Nm of torque at 4,750 rpm, the mill is mated to Honda’s Dual Clutch Transmission, giving automatic shifting. \nThe X-ADV engine also features two ride modes, Drive and Sport, with ABS as standard. Drive mode gives the rider a smooth throttle response and power delivery, while Sport makes the engine more responsive and delays shifting gears. 17YM X-ADV \nManual selection of gears is done using the paddle switches on the left handlebar pod, like the Honda Integra and NC. Weight is claimed to be 238 kg, which makes the X-ADV something of a heavyweight by scooter standards, or by motorcycle standards, for that matter. \nFuel for the X-ADV is carried in a 13.1-litre fuel tank, and seat height is a somewhat tallish 820 mm, with the wide footboards setting the feet apart when at a standstill. Availability for the Honda X-ADV is said to be in April, and will retail in the UK at 9,599 pounds sterling (RM52,203) with three colour options – Matte Bullet Silver, Pearl Glare White and Victory Red – listed on the Honda UK website. 17YM X-ADV", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:28:46.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
