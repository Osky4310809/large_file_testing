They met while Diesen worked as a recovery specialist trainer in the facility where Krieg was treated. \nThe couple said that they were shocked to discover in December that they had conceived a child naturally. \n“I figured we would have to do something else, like in vitro,” Diesen told CBS. “It was a shock this actually happened. Doctors said it would be very rare.” \nThe couple used their pregnancy announcement photo to enter a contest to win a free wedding, and it quickly gained attention online. \nIn the photo, Diesen holds an ultrasound image of their unborn child while Krieg grins and gives a thumbs-up under the words “it still works” written on a wall behind him. A post shared by Todd Krieg (@toddkrieg531) on Feb 8, 2017 at 5:53pm PST \n“He loves that kind of humor,” Diesen, 25, told CBS News. “I said, ‘That is pretty funny. Let’s just do that.’” \n“We wanted to have our friends enjoy this announcement,” she added. “We didn’t want to do something that’s already being done.” \nThe photo has been viewed more than 2.8 million times on Imgur . \nDiesen told People Magazine that most of the responses they have received have been positive. \n“I think that loving someone in Todd’s situation takes a bit more patience and a servant heart, but if you truly love someone, it won’t be any different than if he were up and walking,” Diesen said, adding: \nOf course, it’s tough on me sometimes, not being able to stand up and get a hug from the person I love most, or be able to walk around in public holding hands or go running on the beach together. But honestly, the love that Todd and I have for each other is something I wouldn’t trade for the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:16:53.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
