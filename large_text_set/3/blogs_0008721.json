Stories / YouTube \nRemarkable footage has emerged of four Paris Saint-Germain players discussing their chances of qualification in the build-up to their Champions League last-16 second leg against Barcelona. \nMarco Verratti , Julian Draxler , Blaise Matuidi and Thomas Meunier are shown in conversation while eating in Paris pizzeria, in two films made by the YouTube channel Bros. Stories . \nThe films, made sometime between PSG’s emphatic 4-0 first-leg win and Wednesday’s 6-1 capitulation, feature the four friends talking about food, the size of the Nou Camp pitch and their previous experiences in the Champions League. \nConversation soon turns to their chances of progressing to this season’s quarter-finals and whether they could stomach a heavy defeat against Barcelona. \nVerratti asks: “If we lose 5-1 but we’re through, are you happy or not?” Meuneir says he would be ‘p ’, while Draxler and Matuidi both admit they would be happy. \n“If I would have been told that before the first leg I would have been happy, but now I would be pissed,” replies Verratti. Barcelona vs PSG player ratings Barcelona vs PSG player ratings 1/22 Marc-Andre ter Stegen - 6 out of 10 \nWas rarely tested on an evening when all the action was taking further place up the pitch. Did his job when called upon. Getty 2/22 Gerard Piqué - 7 \nDefiant and resilient throughout, displaying composure at the back and technical ability on the ball too. Getty Images 3/22 Javier Mascherano - 7 \nGave his all. Showed his intent from the start, putting in a series of important challenges and blocks. AFP/Getty Images \nDominant in the air and dominated in his battles with Cavani. Getty Images 5/22 Rafinha - 6 \nDangerous in drifting in from the flank and excellent in finding the right space but some of his deliveries were off the mark. Nonetheless, proved to be a nuisance for much of the night. Getty 6/22 Sergio Busquets - 6 \nIt was a scrappy and frantic night for the Spaniard. His challenges were mistimed and his passes misjudged but his energy was still invaluable in Barcelona's pressing game. Getty Images 7/22 Ivan Rakitic - 7 \nA bundle of enegery throughout. His challenges were vital in breaking up PSG's forward game but almost cost Barcelona the game in allowing Kurzawa to set up Cavani for his away goal. Getty Images 8/22 Andres Iniesta - 7 \nPulled the strings for much of the, playing passes left, right and centre, and wasn't afriad to try his luck from outside the box. Dwindled in influence as the game wore on. AFP/Getty Images 9/22 Lionel Messi - 7 \nHere, there, everywhere. It was another trademark performance from the Argentine but on this occasion he wasn't the man who Barcelona turned to. AFP/Getty Images 10/22 Luis Suárez - 7 \nShowcased the best of his poaching abilities to snatch Barcelona's first goal and proved to be a menace for the entire 95 minutes. AFP/Getty Images 11/22 Neymar - 9 \nAbsolutely sensational. Was instrinsic to Barcelona's late fightback, scoring their first fourth and fifth goal before setting up Sergi Roberto's winner with an exquisite assist. Getty 12/22 Kevin Trapp - 5 \nPoor decision-making handed Barca their first and failed to effectively deal with Iniesta's back-pass for the second. AFP/Getty Images 13/22 Thomas Meunier - 4 \nHis ill-timed foul on Neymar handed Barca their first penalty and third goal. Let down by sloppy mistakes. AFP/Getty Images 14/22 Marquinhos - 4 \nShould have done much better for Barcelona's second, failing to assert himself against Iniesta inside his own box. It was night to forget in all for him. AFP/Getty Images 15/22 Thiago Silva - 6 \nAs ever, Silva was PSG's warrior. But although he rarely shirked a challenge even he was suspectible to lapses in concentration tonight and poor decision-making. Getty Images 16/22 Layvin Kurzawa - 4 \nHis disastrous attempt at a goal-line clearance handed Barcelona their second and he clearly struggled against Rafinha's pace and trickery. Impressive assist for Cavani's goal but, in all, the occasion appeared to get to him. AFP/Getty Images \nFailed to deal with Barcelona's high-intense approach and incessant press. AFP/Getty Images 18/22 Marco Verratti - 6 \nStarted well but grew increasingly timid and quiet as the game wore on. Conceded a number of unnecessary challenges. AFP/Getty Images \nLittle of note to say. Looked overwhelmed at times. Getty Images 20/22 Lucas Moura - 5 \nKept himself busy in the first half but was repeatedly targeted by Barcelona's enforcers and struggled to shine as a result. AFP/Getty Images 21/22 Edinson Cavani - 6 \nDid what was asked of him in expertly clinching PSG's vital away goal. Should have converted an early second-half chance though. Let down by his team-mates. Getty Images \nAnother player who failed to live up to the big occasion. AFP/Getty Images \nMeuneir then explains his reasoning, saying: “Yes you’re through but people will be like: ‘Well PSG you see, we thought they were strong but they lost 5-1 in Barcelona, it’s not OK.” \nWhen asked by Matuidi whether he would prefer to score quickly or go into the break with the score at 0-0, Meuneir says Barcelona have “no choice but to attack. We must put pressure on them.” \nDraxler then adds: “I think we will score in the first half.” \nUnai Emery’s side ultimately scored an away goal in the second half, with Edinson Cavani’s strike seeming to be enough to take them through. \nHowever, a Neymar-inspired seven-minute comeback from Barcelona resulted in a 6-1 scoreline on the night and sent the Catalans through to the quarter-finals.
