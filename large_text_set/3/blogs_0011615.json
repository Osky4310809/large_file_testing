From our position outside the capital city of Romania, the mountain peaks were the color of fading bruises. \nJudging from the heavy snow falling they were likely as cold as dead flesh. Quite a charming thought for a blustery morning. \nA knee struck the side of the carved wooden panel in my compartment again . I closed my eyes, praying that my traveling companion would fall back asleep. One more jitter of his long limbs might unravel my fraying composure. I pressed my head against the plush high-backed seat, focusing on the soft velvet instead of poking his offending limb with my hat pin. \nSensing my growing annoyance, Mr. Thomas Cresswell shifted to tapping his fingers against the windowsill in our compartment. My compartment, actually. \nThomas had his own quarters but insisted on spending every hour of the day possessed in my company, lest a career murderer board the train and unleash carnage. \nAt least that’s the ridiculous story he’d told our chaperone, Mrs. Harvey. She was a charming silver-haired woman who watched over Thomas while he stayed in his Piccadilly flat in London, and was currently on her fourth nap of the new day. \nFather had taken ill in Paris and had placed his trust and my virtue in both Mrs. Harvey’s and Thomas’s care. It spoke volumes as to how highly Father thought of Thomas, and how convincingly innocent and charming my friend could be when the mood or occasion struck. My hands were suddenly warm and damp inside my gloves. \nDerailing that feeling, my focus slid from Thomas’s dark brown hair and crisp suit to his discarded Romanian newspaper. I’d been studying the language enough to make out most of what it said. Thomas, of course, was already fluent. The headline read: Has the Immortal Prince returned? A body had been found staked through the heart near Braşov—the very town we were traveling to—leading the superstitious to believe in the impossible: Vlad Dracula, the centuries-dead Prince of Romania, was alive. And hunting. \nIt was all rubbish meant to inspire fear and sell papers. There was no such thing as an immortal being. Flesh-and-blood men were the real monsters, and they could be cut down easily enough. In the end, even Jack the Ripper bled as all men do. Though papers still claimed he prowled the foggy London streets. Some even said he’d gone to America. \nIf only that were true. \nAn all-too-familiar pang hit my center, stealing my breath. It was always the same when I thought about the Ripper case and the memories it stirred within. When I stared into the looking glass, I still saw the same green eyes and crimson lips—the ancestry of both my mother’s Indian roots and father’s English nobility apparent in my cheekbones. By all outward appearances, I was still a vibrant seventeen-year-old girl. \nAnd yet, I’d taken such a devastating blow to my soul. I wondered how I could appear so whole and still on the outside when inside I was thrashing with turbulence. \nUncle had sensed the shift in me, noticing the careless mistakes I’d started making in his forensic laboratory over the last few days…carbolic acid I’d forgotten to use when cleansing our blades. Specimens I hadn’t collected. A jagged tear I’d made in ice-cold flesh, so unlike my normal precision with the bodies lining his examination table. He’d said nothing, but I knew he was disappointed. I was supposed to have a heart that hardened in the face of death. \nPerhaps I wasn’t meant for a life of forensic studies after all. \nTap. Tap-tap-tap. Tap. \nI gritted my teeth while Thomas tap-tap-tapped along to the chugging of the wheels. How Mrs. Harvey slept through the racket was truly incredible. At least he’d succeeded in drawing me from that deep well of emotions. They were the kind of feelings that were too still and too dark. Stagnant and putrid like swamp water, with red-eyed creatures lurking far below. \nSoon we’d all disembark in Bucharest before traveling the rest of the way by carriage to Bran Castle, home to the Academy of Forensic Medicine and Science, or Institutului Naț ional de Criminalistic ă ș i Medicin ă Legal ă, as it was called in Romanian. Mrs. Harvey would spend a night or two in Braşov before traveling back to London. Part of me longed to go back with her, though I’d never admit it aloud to Thomas. \nAbove our private booth, an opulent chandelier swung in time to the rhythm of the train, its crystals clinking together and adding a new layer of accompaniment to Thomas’s staccato taps. Pushing his incessant melody from my thoughts, I watched the world outside blur in puffs of steam and swishing tree limbs. Leafless branches were encased in sparkling white, their reflections shimmering against the polished near-ebony blue of our luxury train. \nI leaned closer, realizing the branches weren’t covered in snow, but ice. They caught the first light of day and were practically set ablaze in the bright reddish-orange sunrise. It was so peaceful I could almost forget— wolves ! I stood so abruptly that Thomas jumped in his seat. Mrs. Harvey snored loudly, the sound akin to a snarl. I blinked and the creatures were gone, replaced by branches swaying as the train chugged onward. \nWhat I had thought were glinting fangs were only wintry boughs. I exhaled. I’d been hearing phantom howls all night. Now I was seeing things that weren’t there during daylight hours, too. \n“I’m going to…stretch my limbs.” \nThomas raised dark brows and leaned forward, but before he could offer to accompany me, I rushed for the door and slid it open. \n“I need a few moments. Alone.” \n“Try not to miss me too much, Wadsworth.” Thomas sat back, his face falling slightly before his expression was once again playful. The lightness didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Though that might be an impossible task. I, for one, miss myself terribly when asleep.” \n“What was that, dear?” Mrs. Harvey asked, blinking behind her spectacles. \n“I said you ought to try counting sheep.” \n“Was I sleeping again?” \nI took advantage of the distraction, shutting the door behind me and grabbing my skirts. I didn’t want Thomas reading the expression on my face. The one that I hadn’t yet mastered in his presence. \nI wandered down the narrow corridor, barely taking in the grandiosity as I slowly made my way towards the dining car. I couldn’t stay out here unchaperoned for long, but I needed an escape. If only from my own thoughts and worries. \nLast week, I had seen my cousin Liza was walking up the stairs in my home. A sight as normal as anything, except she’d left weeks prior for the country. Days later something a bit darker occurred. I’d sworn a cadaver craned its head toward me in Uncle’s laboratory, its unblinking gaze full of scorn at the blade in my hand, its mouth full of maggots pouring onto the examination table. When I’d blinked, all was well. \nI’d brought several medical journals for the journey, but hadn’t had an opportunity to research my symptoms with Thomas openly studying me. He’d said I needed to confront my grief, but I’d rather not reopen that wound yet. One day, maybe. \nA few compartments down, a door slid open, dragging me into the present. A man with primly styled hair exited the chamber, moving swiftly down the corridor. His suit was charcoal and made of fine material, apparent by the way it draped over his broad shoulders. When he tugged a silver comb from his overcoat, I nearly cried out. Something in my core twisted so violently my knees buckled. \nIt couldn’t be. He had died weeks ago in that awful accident. My mind knew the impossibility standing before me, striding away with his perfect hair and matching clothing, yet my heart refused to listen. \nI fisted my cream skirts and ran. I’d know that stride anywhere. Science could not explain the power of love or hope. There were no formulas or deductions for understanding, no matter what Thomas claimed regarding science versus humanity. \nThe man tipped his hat to passengers sitting down to tea. I was only half aware of their open-mouthed stares as I bounded after him, my own hat tilting to one side. \nHe approached the door to the cigar room, halting a moment to wrench the outer-door open to travel between cars. Smoke leeched from the room and mixed with an icy blast of air, the scent strong enough to make my insides roil. I reached out, tugging the man around, ready to toss my arms around him and cry. The events last month were only a nightmare. My— \n“Domnișoară?” \nTears pricked my eyes. The hairstyle and clothing did not belong to who I’d believed they did. I swiped the first bit of wetness that slid down my cheeks, not caring if I smudged the kohl I’d taken to wearing around my eyes. \nHe lifted a walking cane, switching it to his other hand. He hadn’t even been holding a comb. I was losing touch with what was real. I slowly backed away, noting the quiet chatter of the car behind us. The clink of teacups, the mixed accents of world travelers, all of it a crescendo building in my chest. Panic made breathing more difficult than the corset binding my ribs. \nI panted, trying to draw in enough air to soothe my jumbling nerves. The clatter and laughter rose to a shrill pitch. Part of me wished the cacophony would drown out the pulse thrashing in my head. I was about to be sick. \n“Are you all right, domnișoară ? You appear…” \nI laughed, uncaring that he jerked away from my sudden outburst. Oh, if there was such a thing as a Higher Power, they were having fun at my expense. “ Domnișoară ” finally registered. This man spoke with a Romanian accent. He wasn’t even English. And his hair wasn’t blond at all. It was light brown. \n“ Scuze ,” I said, forcing myself out of hysterics with a meager apology. “I mistook you for someone else.” \nBefore I could embarrass myself further, I dipped my chin and quickly retreated to my private car. I kept my head down, ignoring the whispers and giggles, though I’d heard enough. \nI needed to collect myself before I saw Thomas again. I’d pretended otherwise, but I’d seen the concern crinkling his brow. The extra care in the way he’d tease or annoy me. I knew precisely what he was doing each time he irked me. After what my family had gone through, any other gentleman would have treated me as if I were a porcelain doll, easily fractured and discarded for being broken. Thomas was unlike other young men, however. \nI came upon my compartment and threw my shoulders back. It was time to wear the cool exterior of a scientist. My tears had dried and my heart was now a solid fist in my chest. I breathed in, and exhaled. Jack the Ripper was never coming back. A real a statement as any. \nThere were no career murderers on this train. Another fact. \nThe Autumn of Terror ended last month. \nWolves were most certainly not hunting anyone on the Orient Express. \nIf I wasn’t careful, I’d start believing Dracula had risen next. \nI allowed myself another deep breath before I slid the door open, banishing all thoughts of immortal princes as I entered the compartment.
