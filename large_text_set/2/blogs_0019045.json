By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 21, 2017 12:18 PM Prime Minister Narendra Modi focused on the jointness of defence forces. (PTI) \nAfter the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , armed forces and defence ministry are coming to an agreement over another 4-star military officer who will be the PermanentChairman of Chiefs of Staff Committee (PC-CoSC). The idea of making a single-point military advisor to the government emerged after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement during the Combined Commanders Conference at Dehradun last month. The news was confirmed to The Indian Express by two military officers who attended the conference and said Prime Minister’s focus was on combining the three defence forces. \nThe officials, however, cleared that there was no mention of integrating the three services and neither did the Prime Minister mentioned any plans about it. “The decision to have a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) or PC-CoSC is finally a political one. But the three services have all agreed to the idea of a PC-CoSC, who will look after common functions of the three services like intelligence, procurement and perhaps training,” a senior military official said. \nYou may also want to watch: \nThe idea of creating the single-point military commander post was suggested by the Group of Ministers (GoM) report on national security in 2001. The members then suggested that the new commander will be senior to the three military chiefs. However, the proposal wasn’t accepted by the political parties and defence services. \nIn 2012, the Naresh Chandra committee recommended a PC-CoSC, an appointment at par with the three service chiefs. This is an idea which seems to be gaining ground among the defence services and the ministry and Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has repeatedly said that he will make his recommendation to the Cabinet after the ministry considers the report of the expert committee chaired by Lt General D B Shekatkar (retired). \nYou may also want to watch: \nA top official from the defence ministry revealed that the proposal has been studied and an action will be taken over it soon. The top defence ministry official also confirmed that they had identified certain senior posts in the ministry to be occupied by military officers. Last month, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had said that the Air Force was too small to be split between integrated theatre commands.
