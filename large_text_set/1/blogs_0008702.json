PUBLISHED: 11:26,   12:35, Wed, Jan 11, 2017 \nTwenty radical leftie activists including Jeremy Corbyn backers Momentum, the National Union of Students and Brexit denying Labour MP David Lammy put their names to the missive railing against a “wave of hatred sweeping Britain”. \nThey claimed migrants are being “blamed for a range of social ills” from overcrowding in schools to the state of the NHS, and expressed their disappointment mainstream Labour MPs are starting to listen to and reflect public concern over levels of immigration. GETTY Left-wing activists have penned a letter railing against criticism of free movement Related articles Labour donor: Corbyn now recognises public wish for migration controls \nThe letter was published just hours after Mr Corbyn endured a day of chaos over Labour’s immigration policy, first indicating that the party was “not wed” to the idea of free movement before later backtracking and supporting current levels of net migration. \nKey signatories include top union figures from the NUT, TSSA and BMA, a plethora of pro-EU groups, four members of the Labour party’s National Executive Committee and a representative from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. GETTY Jeremy Corbyn endured a torrid day yesterday over Labour's chaotic migration policies GETTY Net migration to Britain is currently running at more than 300,000 people per year \nIn the letter, published in today’s Guardian, they state: “Migrants have not run down our public services, it’s not them that failed to build the houses our economy needs and they don’t cause a race to the bottom on wages or conditions. \n“In fact, the free movement of people can build our collective power and creativity in the face of attempts by the super-rich to turn the world into a gigantic marketplace in which we are all isolated individuals competing against one another. \n“A democracy must defend the most vulnerable in society – all of them. And we must provide the services and homes for people who come to this country who add to its economy and its culture.” We must provide the services and homes for people who come to this country The letter \nA number of the claims made in the letter are unsubstantiated, including that EU migration can help to fight the “rich and powerful who have done so much damage to our country” and that high levels of new arrivals do not push down the wages of British workers. \nIndependent analysis by experts at the Bank of England has concluded that for every 10 per cent rise in immigration, the pay of low-skilled workers such as care home assistants, shop and restaurant staff and cleaners falls by just under two per cent. \nAnd the biggest and most vociferous cheerleaders for continued free movement of people have been and continue to be big businesses, including banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, as well as food and drink and construction giants. \nAn academic study into the impact of free movement by the Brussels-backed National Institution for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) revealed how one unnamed London-based cafe chain is “staffed almost entirely by EU migrants” whilst big businesses in hospitality and construction also rely heavily on European workers.
