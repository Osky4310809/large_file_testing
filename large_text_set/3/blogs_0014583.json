Rosen’s Bagel Co./Official Austin isn’t really known for bagels, but Rosen’s Bagel Co. wants to do something about that. Owner Tom Rosen launched his bagel-focused pop-up and catering company recently, which will eventually lead to a brick and mortar cafe. Austin is full of “people with strong bagel traditions,” Rosen told Eater, and the city was “absent of really good bagels.” He decided to venture into bagels after stints at fine dining restaurants and an attempt to study food at UT. The mark of a good bagel, to Rosen, is good crust, and good chew. Rosen’s will focus on New York-style bagels, with an with the classics: poppy, sesame, everything, plain, etc. He’s throwing a few herb-topped options, too: rosemary and basil — “slightly different and approachable,” he described. As for the cream cheese, Rosen is experimenting with various types. There are lime-roasted poblano and scallions, lemon and basil, and for a Texas nod, the caramelized shallots and bacon. Plus, there’s the usual accoutrements: lox, scallions, capers, tomatoes, The end goal is a brick and mortar cafe, but currently, there is nothing in the works. For now, Rosen’s is holding pop-up brunches at various homes, as well as catering gigs, such as WeWork events during SXSW. In the near future, it will hold regular pop-ups at East Side coffee shop and beer spot Wright Bros. Brew & Brew. Other Austin bagel spots include Wholy Bagel, Rockstar Bagels, and and newcomer Biderman's Deli.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:18:25.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
