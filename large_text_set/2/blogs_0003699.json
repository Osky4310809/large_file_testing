Manitoba’s Welcome Place refugee agency helped 91 claimants between Nov. 1 and Jan. 25 – more than the agency normally sees in a year. Most braved the freezing prairie winter to walk into Canada. Self-deporting? Interesting but also unnecessary. You can blame the media for this one. They have created a ridiculous narrative that Trump is anti-refugee and anti-immigrant. He’s neither. He didn’t impose a “Muslim” ban. He imposed a temporary freeze on immigration from 7 countries identified as potential national security risks by the Obama Administration. Increased vetting is not the same thing as a “Muslim ban” or a “travel ban”. The media knows that but they have pushed the lie anyway.
