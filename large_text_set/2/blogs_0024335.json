Decluttering your social feeds is equivalent to decluttering your mind. Sherrie Bourg Carter , psychologist and author, claims that clutter bombards our minds with excessive stimuli causing our senses to work overtime on stimuli that aren’t necessary or important. It leaves you feeling frustrated, anxious and overwhelmed. Without the negativity clouding your feeds—and, by extension, your everyday thoughts—you will start to think more clearly. Unburdened by a constant stream of cynicism, sarcasm, and gloominess, you will remember just how many reasons you have to smile. Your self-esteem skyrockets. Seeing positive messages will help you feel more confident. By sharing only authentic self-love posts, uplifting memes, and articles highlighting random acts of kindness, you will start to feel better about humanity overall, including yourself. Clinical and Development Psychologist, Donna Wick , says it is proven that negative social media presence is a direct correlation to kids growing up with more anxiety and less self-esteem. You rid yourself of unnecessary drama. Negativity and drama go hand in hand. Once you remove the toxic people from your social feeds, you won’t get roped into the drama so easily. When your mind isn’t busy trying to piece together the hidden meaning behind a few subtweets or speculating about other people’s problems, you’re free to do you 100 percent of the time. You attract more positive people. When you surround yourself with endless optimism, you become more positive yourself. As a result, you draw cheerful people and rewarding experiences into your life. The warm people will replace any emotional vampires who once robbed you of energy with their negative, draining attitudes. Julia Orloff , a clinical professor at UCLA, says “the more positive energy we give off, the more we’ll receive.” Your productivity increases. When you focus on the good in life, you tend to become more hopeful and thus more willing to work towards your goals. Your creativity and productivity levels are bound to rise because you’re in such a healthy state of mind. You can breathe easier. Once you rid your social media accounts of virtual poison, your feeds transform from icy, barren lands into cocoons of loving, supportive warmth. So you can rest easy as you scroll rather than anticipating the next angry post sitting behind the next click. You will also start to feel more relaxed in general, and better equipped to take on life’s daily challenges. You find yourself judging others less. In most cases, pessimistic people—whether they’re friends, family members, or doomsday journalists—are the type to spend a lot of time criticizing others because it makes them feel better about themselves. When you regularly ingest that type of negativity through social media, it seeps into your brain, causing you to say or think uncharacteristically awful things. Cleaning your feeds is the best way to avoid reducing yourself to the level of those who rant and rave for sport. Your overall outlook improves. How many times have you looked at social media and something upsetting somehow taints your mood? You might not even realize how much of an effect negative social posts are having on you until you eradicate them entirely. The content you consume is impactful, so you might as well digest a healthy diet of positivity. After all, just like Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.” You express more gratitude. Without anger and resentment populating your feeds, you will start to take note of all the small but meaningful things you should be thankful for. Being positive makes you more acutely aware of how blessed you are, and, in turn, more appreciative of everything around you. Ultimately, you will feel more grateful to be alive. You become more of do-gooder. When you curate your social feeds to reflect the softer, kinder aspects of life, you inevitably become kinder yourself. Rather than feeling hurt from what you encounter online, you feel inspired to spread goodwill and cheer. Kindness inspires kindness and a positive experience on social media will help you become more empathetic and selfless.
