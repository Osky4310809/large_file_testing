Reporters Jonathan Swan and Mike Allen described the Trump transition team’s action plan for the agency, which they were able to catch a glimpse of while covering the incoming administration. While they didn’t republish the complete document, the summary they’ve provided is terrifying enough. \nThe excerpt the reporters published claims that the agency is manipulating the research it uses to further a political agenda – presumably, a reference to evidence-based policy addressing climate change . The quote in full reads: \n“EPA does not use science to guide regulatory policy as much as it uses regulatory policy to steer the science. This is an old problem at EPA. In 1992, a blue-ribbon panel of EPA science advisers that [sic] ‘science should not be adjusted to fit policy.’ But rather than heed this advice, EPA has greatly increased its science manipulation.” \nRelated: The White House website has already been scrubbed of any mention of climate change \nWhile it’s unknown exactly who authored the document, the contents are not terribly surprising given that Trump’s transition team was headed by Myron Ebell, one of many career climate deniers on the incoming President’s team. \nIt’s important to note that while this new attitude toward the EPA certainly puts much of the country’s climate and clean air policy at risk, environmentalists can at least take comfort in the fact that Congressional support would be needed to overturn many of the agency’s rules. It’s also likely that staff within the agency itself will oppose Trump’s anti-environmental agenda . Those two facts give concerned citizens room to fight for strong anti-pollution standards as the new administration takes office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T14:24:25.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
