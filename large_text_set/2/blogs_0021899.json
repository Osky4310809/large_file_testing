Several stars showed up sporting blue ribbons in show of support for the American Civil Liberties Union.\nThe “Stand with the ACLU” ribbons, are out in force to show support for the organization and its mission to protect civil liberties and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, according to a statement by the ACLU obtained by People.\nWho ever thought we'd be fashion icons? #Oscars https://t.co/ii6f71xKq3 \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) February 26, 2017 \nRuth Negga, nominated for Best Actress for the movie Loving , was the first star of the night spotted with the ribbon pinned to Valentino red-lace dress. The movie, which stars Negga as Mildred Loving, follows the 1967 Supreme Court case around her interracial marriage to Richard Loving (played by Joel Edgerton). The ACLU eventually took up the Lovings’ cause.\n \nDirector Barry Jenkins, nominated for Moonlight, also donned the ribbon, as did Lin-Manuel Miranda, who is nominated for Best Original Song for the animated film Moana .\n@ACLU the #ribbon at #Oscars pic.twitter.com/XqCrQUMeqP \n— Jewel Shepard (@Jewelshepard) February 26, 2017 \nFeeling blue: @ACLU ribbons are this year's accessory #Oscars pic.twitter.com/COBdttW18K \n— Karen Heller (@kheller) February 26, 2017 \nModel Karlie Kloss also showed her support, wearing the ribbon against her white gown.\n@karliekloss also in an @ACLU pin and a killer hair flip. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/6AR7QUGNWE \n— Aimée Blanchette (@AimeeBlanchette) February 26, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:38:41.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
