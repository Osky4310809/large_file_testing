By Tareq Haddad February 18, 2017 20:56 GMT Donald Trump (R) poses with the chairman of DAMAC Properties Hussain Sajwani (C) and wife Melania Trump at an earlier event to mark the development of Trump World Golf Club in Dubai (file photo). Trump Golf Dubai \nUS President Donald Trump's two sons have attended a glitzy opening of his luxury golf course in Dubai, a month after he said he would not do deals with the country. \nEric and Donald Jr were given the red-carpet treatment at the launch of the Trump International Golf Course on Saturday (18 February), where they posed for pictures with Gulf property magnate Hussain Sajwani. \nThe pair now manage Trump's vast business empire across the world, which many claimed posed a conflict of interests and was a violation of the US Constitution's emolument clause , which prevents public officials from accepting payments or gifts from foreign governments without congressional consent. \nThere are also concerns that Trump's business interests could open him up to bribes or threats from foreign governments. \nA corporate membership at the club is about $15,000 (£12,000) up front, plus about $21,800 per year, according to Bloomberg . A single person can join for $6,800 plus a $9,530 annual fee. \nThe 18-hole course is part of a larger villa and apartment building project by Damac Properties Dubai, owned by Sajwani. \nIt will contain over 9,000 villas and condos, which will sell between $1.3m and $4m per property, according to the Washington Post . \nIn January, Trump said he was offered $2bn by Sajwani for a new deal, which he said he turned down in an effort to quell speculation business interests would override his responsibility as president. \n\"Over the weekend, I was offered $2bn to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very amazing man, a great developer from the Middle East,\" Trump said, in what was his first press conference since being elected. \n\"I turned it down. I didn't have to turn it down.\" \nDespite the comments, the Trump empire's dealings in the United Arab Emirates are set to grow even further, with another Trump-branded golf course set to open next year. \nAccording to a Federal Election Commission report last year, Trump received between $1m and $5m from Damac Properties. #DAMAC Properties Inaugurates #Trump International Golf Club #Dubai at DAMAC Hills — MENA Herald (@MENAHerald) February 18, 2017 More from IBTimes UK", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:13:33.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
