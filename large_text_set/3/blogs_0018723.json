For example, that Bible’s version of Genesis 1:25 reads, in part: “And God made the beast of the earth after his kind.” \nThe New Testament also creates thorny problems for advocates of “inclusive” gender language. For example, Matthew 18:11 reads: “For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.” \nThe very exact phrase “son of man” interweaves in a very critical way throughout several Old Testament and New Testament books, including Ezekiel, Daniel, the Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles and Revelation. \nIn any case, Bethel University’s faculty language guide also urges professors to avoid several phrases including “man and wife.” \nOther sections of the guide address “inclusive language” as it relates to age, race, disabilities and social class. \nBethel University’s faculty committee on family and gender equity created the school document on “inclusive” language. \nThe document repeatedly stresses that its advice is voluntary and not mandatory. \n“Our goal is to encourage a humble and Christ-like use of language, not to fetter specific disciplines,” the document explains. \nA single year of tuition, fees and room and board at Bethel University currently costs $46,550 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T15:32:19.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
