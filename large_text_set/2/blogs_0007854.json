RELATED LINKS View sale results \nA half-sister to US Grade 1 Yellow Ribbon Handicap winner Spanish Fern, Green Room has produced four winners to date with Signe being a three-parts sister to Together Forever, a daughter of Galileo who claimed the Fillies' Mile and 1m Listed Silken Glider Stakes for Aidan O'Brien in 2014. \nSigne is also a half-sister to Lord Shanakill, who secured four stakes victories including the 2009 Group 1 Prix Jean Prat and also finished runner-up by a nose in the previous year's Dewhurst Stakes. \nOriginally retired to the Irish National Stud, Lord Shanakill was represented by a first Group 1 winner last season with My Dream Boat successful in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. The son of Speightstown currently stands at Pin Oak Lane Farm in Pennsylvania for $4,000. \nGreen Room is also a half-sister to Rusty Back, the dam of US Grade 1 Santa Anita Handicap victor Heatseeker, as both are daughters of Chain Fern, an unraced sister to Al Bahathri. \nThe 1985 Irish 1,000 Guineas heroine developed into an important broodmare for Hamdan Al Maktoum, producing eight winners from ten runners including Haafhd who was crowned champion three-year-old in England in 2004 after victories in the 2,000 Guineas and Champion Stakes. She also appears as grandam of multiple Group 1 winners Gladiatorus and Military Attack as well as third dam of popular globetrotters Big Orange and Red Cadeaux. \nAs befits her distinguished pedigree, Signe attracted plenty of attention when offered at the 2014 Goffs Orby Sale, eventually selling to Amanda Skiffington on behalf of Fiona Carmichael and Ian Jennings for €1.1m, the second highest price at the sale. \nGreen Room has gone on to produce a filly by Dansili in 2014, subsequently named Black Ruby, and in 2015 she foaled a sister to Together Forever by Galileo who fetched €900,000 at last year's Goffs Orby Yearling Sale when purchased by M V Magnier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:59:54.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
