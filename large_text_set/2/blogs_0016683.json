It seems like just yesterday when Suri was born, but she’s now 10 years old, and we’re afraid we’ll blink and she’ll be all grown up.\nA few days ago Katie posted a throwback picture of herself and her brother when they were kids. She must be about 8 years old in the photo, and she’s sitting cross-legged with a big smile on her face.\n#tbt my big brother and me #proudsister @stjohnsjesuit \nA post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Feb 16, 2017 at 7:08pm PST \nKatie has kept that same sweet smile with her all these years. There’s one more thing about this picture, though, that we can’t shake: how much young Katie looks like Suri today. They’re practically twins. Check out the most recent picture we’ve seen of Suri in December of last year.\nBirthday vibes continued ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ so grateful today \nA post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Dec 18, 2016 at 7:35pm PST \n\nSame smile, same nose, same glow. They’re spitting images of each other.\nThe times we get to see Suri featured on Katie’s Instagram are few and far in between, but they’re always precious moments of mother-daughter bonding. Plus, each time we see Suri she’s getting bigger and bigger, and she resembles Katie more every single day. Remember that one time last year when Suri helped Katie on set?\nMy sweetie ❤️ #setlife #gratitude \nA post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Jun 16, 2016 at 12:59pm PDT \nThey’re one of the cutest mother-daughter duos in all of Hollywood. We have a feeling that as Suri gets older she’s also adopting her mother’s keen sense of fashion. That polka-dot blouse is probably the first of many pieces from Suri’s closet that we’ll unashamedly covet.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:59:26.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
