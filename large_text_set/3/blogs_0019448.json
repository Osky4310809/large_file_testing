Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters \nSource: Reuters Inside the store, customers can design their own sweater, which is made out of merino wool and costs $215. Here are some of the colors and patterns the sweaters come in. Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters \nSource: Reuters Customers have the option of picking a standard size sweater (like small, medium, large, etc.) or having a laser body scan so it's custom fitted. Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters \nSource: Reuters To pick the design of the sweater, customers will go into a dark room and stand in the middle of an illuminated box. Different patterns will be projected on the chest. Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters \nSource: Reuters The patterns can be moved around on the sweater using hand gestures, which are picked up by sensors. Adidas \nSource: Reuters Customers will be able to try out several options, then look at them all later on a monitor. Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters It's also possible to test out different colors by putting swatches on this cool, high-tech gadget. Adidas The sweaters are knitted on machines right in the store. Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters Then, they're finished off by hand, washed, and dried. Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters A sweater will be ready four hours after starting the process. Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters \nSource: Reuters The pop-up store in Berlin is the only one of its kind, but the data Adidas is compiling and the feedback it's getting from customers is being taken into account. If all goes well, the company may pursue more of these types of stores. Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters \nSource: Reuters Adidas is already having a moment in the US, in part thanks to the resurgence of its classic low-top sneakers and Stan Smith-branded shoes, but it's still No. 2 among sportswear brands. Cool tech innovations like this one might just give it the boost it needs.
