He represents Queens, contributes to the paper and does a bang-up job of protecting folks across the five boroughs . (If pushed, he’ll lend a hand to the whole tri-state area. He’s a good egg, that Peter Parker.) Three fresh new posters for Spider-Man: Homecoming make a point to underline that our webslinging hero has New York in his blood. Also, in this blood? Radioactivity. That’s a separate subject, mind you. No need to cause a health scare.\nOver the past few days, posters have dropped for the summer blockbuster with Spidey enjoying his NYC surroundings. We think he’s enjoying the surroundings.

The Garfield Era ), there seems to be a pretty active cultural appetite for this particular redo. Spidey’s Civil War cameo definitely went a long way in establishing further good will and the Marvel Cinematic Universe sheen has its allure. Filmgoers will be able to sort out the quality of the finished product for themselves on July 7 when Tom Holland makes his solo Spider-Man movie debut.\n(Via Deadline )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:07:02.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
