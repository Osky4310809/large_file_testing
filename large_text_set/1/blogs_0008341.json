In the summer of 2015, the Rutgers University art history major began arranging candies, crayons, and other multichromatic mass-produced objects into precise geometric patterns , after a Facebook group art prompt challenged him to make unedited smartphone images more compelling. \nHillman identifies his medium as \"arrangements,\" rather than photography. Snapping the picture is one part of the process, but he says that aspects of painting and sculpture are equally important. \"My work is motivated by a strong love of art, pattern, and color,\" he tells The Creators Project. His primary influences are Minimalism and de Stijl, updated for the post-Warhol commodified culture. \nCandy-colored palettes proliferated during 2016 , but sourcing literal candy and meticulously organizing it into geometric patterns is Hillman's ode to the pillars of line, shape, and color. \"One of the reasons people feel that my work is visually satisfying is the optical effects of my designs,\" he says. \"While I did not originally mean to satisfy people, it's definitely a happy accident.\" This year, Hillman hopes to explore video as a medium, small experiments of which you can check out on his Instagram page. Explore his Pinterest-perfect repertoire of satisfying, seven-hued arrangements below. \nSee more of Adam Hillman's work on his website . \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T17:58:41.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
