See more photos of: Expand Just a couple of months ago, McCartney debuted her first-ever men’s collection in a big way: She took over Abbey Road Studios, where her father, Paul McCartney (heard of him?), recorded the album of the same name with The Beatles back in 1969. Vogue.com ’s Sarah Mower called it “a mini-Glastonbury of a night,” complete with performances from The Beastie Boys, Beth Ditto, and more. Kate Moss was there, too.

She was also one of the first designers to embrace luxury athletic gear with her Adidas x Stella McCartney collections. In early November, she staged an immersive event in Los Angeles, where models arranged in five groups practiced different workouts in the new aSMC collection: Eniko Mihalik led a group on the treadmills, while others “recovered” with paddleboard yoga. At the time, McCartney told Vogue Runway: “There’s never been a compromise between what I do in fashion and what I bring to this collaboration.” Photo: Courtesy of Adidas by Stella McCartney See more photos of: Expand It shouldn’t come as a surprise that music is the main event at many of McCartney’s parties. Last year, she rolled out the red carpet at Amoeba Records in Hollywood to celebrate Pre-Fall ’16 . The Beach Boys performed, Katy Perry and Gwyneth Paltrow mingled among the stacks of record players, and models in leopard-printed faux furs and tulle dresses played arcade games.

For Pre-Fall ’15 , McCartney took over the Convent of the Sacred Heart on the Upper East Side, where models in fuzzy hats, head-to-toe ribbed knits, and cat-printed jumpsuits played mini golf and ping-pong in between dancing to a four-piece band. Photo: REX See more photos of: Expand McCartney has hosted several Resort garden parties at the Elizabeth Street Garden, a small, sculpture-studded plot of land between apartment buildings in Nolita. For Resort ’15 , models in her signature striped dresses and mask-printed playsuits strolled through the grass and blew bubbles with the likes of Cara Delevingne and Lorne Michaels. It certainly beat a chilly showroom. Photo: REX See more photos of: Expand The landmark Upper East Side building for the Americas Society served as the backdrop for McCartney’s Pre-Fall ’13 presentation , where models in jewel-toned coats played board games or posed for artists who sketched their portraits on giant pads of paper. Whether McCartney chooses a grand ballroom or a tiny, overgrown garden, the vibe is the same: cool, laid-back, and above all, fun. Photo: REX See more photos of: Expand During the Spring ’17 shows, several designers staged their presentations in the New York Marble Cemetery on Second Avenue, but McCartney may have gotten there first. For Resort ’13 , she set up a carnival in the East Village cemetery complete with ring tosses and lemonade stands. It was a perfect setting for the models’ nearly neon suits and oversize floral blazers—standout pieces that still look great more than four years later . Photo: Getty Images See more photos of: Expand For Pre-Fall ’12 , McCartney chose the romantic West Village haunt One If By Land, Two If By Sea. There was a light equestrian vibe in the models’ riding boots, three-button blazers, and buffalo-check coats, but the coolest girls in the room were in full-on suits. They didn’t look stiff or serious, though—they shot pool and played Scrabble, and made a strong case for McCartney’s now-signature tailoring.

We already have a sense of the month’s big talking points, from Raf Simons ’s debut at Calvin Klein to fashion’s reaction to the president-elect, but there’s also mounting evidence that a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it runway show is no longer the best way to see fashion in 2017. Designers are shaking things up, from see-now-buy-now collections ( Ralph Lauren , Tom Ford ), to combined men’s and women’s shows ( Vetements , Gucci ), and sunny West Coast events ( Rebecca Minkoff , Tommy Hilfiger ). Others are skipping shows altogether in favor of fun, Instagram-friendly presentations, like dance performances and cocktail parties. \nOf course, this is nothing new for Stella McCartney . She’s been hosting off-kilter, nontraditional Resort and Pre-Fall events for years (long before social media was part of a designer’s business strategy, by the way). The Elizabeth Street Garden was the perfect backdrop for McCartney’s cheeky striped dresses and superhero-printed suits of Resort ’15; rewind a few more years, and models in neon suits played games and drank lemonade at McCartney’s carnival-theme Resort ’13 event. In 2017, every designer—especially the young ones—would do well to take a few party-planning tips from Stella. \nTonight, McCartney is bringing editors way uptown for her Pre-Fall ’17 extravaganza at the Cotton Club, Harlem’s legendary jazz venue and restaurant. We have a feeling there will be some great music and joyful, optimistic clothes to match—stay tuned for our coverage later tonight, and revisit some of McCartney’s best presentations in the slideshow, above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:50:15.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
