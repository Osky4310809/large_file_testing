It's the all important second ODI at Cuttack and England will be looking to avoid a series loss and take the series to Kolkata. Virat Kohli-led India will be aiming to wrap up the series here and make the 3rd ODI a mere formality. \nWhile the Indian batting looks to be firing on all cylinders, Kohli would be a little worried about his team's bowling which took quite a beating at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium. A similar performance would mean more pressure on the batsmen, especially on the likes of the captain and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. \nPacers Umesh Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah were particularly expensive in the first ODI and could not keep a check on their full tosses and no balls, in their attempt to bowl yorkers. \nThe Cuttack game is also a chance for both Dhoni and Yuvraj, who have won India several matches in the past together, to spend some valuable time at the crease. Though, Dhoni batted well in the practice game at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai ahead of the series, a good outing in an official game will definitely boost his confidence.
