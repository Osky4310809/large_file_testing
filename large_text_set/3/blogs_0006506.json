We’re really happy for the filmmaker and we’re dead sure that he will make a really good parent. Karan released a statement today confirming news about his children and said,” I am ecstatic to share with you all the two most wonderful additions to my life, my children and lifelines; Roohi and Yash. I feel enormously blessed to be a parent to these pieces of my heart who were welcomed into this world with the help of the marvels of medical science. This was an emotional yet well thought out decision which I have taken after considering all the responsibilities and duties that come with being a parent.” \nNot just Karan, but all close friends and fans are super happy for him. Karan had been planning on becoming a father for over a year now and we think he will make a terrific parent. We already know how protective and loving he is towards his friends and young actors who he launched. In fact, even celebrities think Karan would make a great parent. The actor will be raising his kids along with his mother and is the second single father after Tusshar Kapoor to have a baby outside the wedlock.

Karan, however, took his time to ensure that he knows what he is doing. He only went ahead with the surrogacy after preparing himself mentally, physically, emotionally and logistically, as per his statement. He had also mentioned in An Unsuitable Boy that he was in a phase where he used to take pills to fight depression but got out of it soon. And we’re glad that he did not take this decision to have kids while he was still battling depression. \nKaran is comfortable with himself and is accepting \nYou’ll have to let go of your personal insecurities when you become a parent. Parenting comes with a new set of insecurities that all parents battle. After all the roast and jokes about Karan Johar’s homosexuality, he is pretty much in a phase where he is comfortable with what he is. He would obviously ensure that his kids are also capable of accepting themselves for who they are. \nHe will be a great emotional support \nNo matter how many times the fimmaker has spoken about breaking down emotionally, he has always been there for close friends and family when they needed a shoulder to cry on. And considering how much he has been through emotionally, we’re hoping that he proves to be a great emotional support to his kids as well. (ALSO READ: Karan Johar becomes a father and congratulations pour in for him on Twitter ) \nFriends like family \nKaran has friends and friends like family who would go out of their way to make sure they are there to help Karan raise his children. In fact, some of his closest friends like Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan are already parents. \nIt’s all about loving your family \nKaran’s fatherly instincts are not a secret in the industry. We have seen it when he worked with Bebo and then, when he launched Alia Bhatt. He protected them and groomed them to become the influential personalities they are right now. Though raising two kids alone could be a difficult job for Karan but we’re sure that his paternal instincts and his ability to love unconditionally will ensure his kids are growing up in a positive environment. \nDo you also think Karan will make a great parent?
