More details to come, so stay tuned for that.\nThis follows Starbucks’ announcement in January, when the Seattle-based company unveiled a new third-party skill for Amazon Alexa , letting regular customers reorder their favorite coffee and food by saying “Alexa, order my Starbucks” to a device powered by the online retail giant’s voice-enabled personal assistant.\nStarbucks’ Alexa skill works via the Starbucks Mobile Order & Pay feature, which lets customers place and pay for an order in advance and pick it up at a nearby Starbucks store without waiting in line.\nWith the new Alexa skill, customers designate their “usual” Starbucks order in advance and can then place the order from one of the most recent 10 stores they’ve ordered from, using their voice with an Amazon Echo or other Alexa-enabled device.\nFord, meanwhile, begin rolling out integration with Alexa voice in January , starting by allowing hybrid and electric vehicle owners to interact with and control their cars from inside their homes using Amazon Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:03:23.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
