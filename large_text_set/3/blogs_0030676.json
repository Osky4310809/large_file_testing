They are facing food and electricity shortages, a representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Iraq earlier told Reuters, adding that between 8,000 and 12,000 people flee the city daily. \nThe US insists that no more than 200 civilians have been killed in coalition airstrikes in Mosul, but the UK-based monitoring group Airwars says the number could be more than 10 times higher.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:54:35.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
