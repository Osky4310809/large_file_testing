(Photo: Emma McIntyre, Getty Images for Vanity Fair) \nHave you ever had that nightmare where you leave the house without pants? Something tells us Angela Sarafyan would be less panicked about that scenario. \nThe Westworld actress attended the Vanity Fair and L'Oreal Paris Toast to Young Hollywood party at West Hollywood's Delilah Tuesday wearing a form-hugging, off-the shoulder gown that looked innocent enough from the front. \nBefore you yawn and say, 'NBD' hold that thought. (Photo: Emma McIntyre, Getty Images for Vanity Fair) Evan Rachel Wood no longer has to keep that 'Westworld' secret \nBut when the actress turned to the side, she revealed a whole lot of skin and confidence. An illusion panel joined the front and the back of Sarafyan's gown together, putting her toned side on display. \nIt's even more daring than the Antonio Berardi number that Gwyneth Paltrow wore to an Iron Man 3 premiere in 2013. \nTa-da!
