The subject is obviously nothing new — isht, y’all fight everyday in the comments over this same topic, but Lynden was unjustly targeted when a Dolphins player self-hating c00n responded with some pretty harsh words about black women. \n#Redskins Lyndon Antonio Trail asked his followers \"Why do black athletes marry white women?\" This is how a #MiamiDolphins player responded pic.twitter.com/zfO9Dvz9bO \n— BallerAlert (@balleralert) March 16, 2017 \n\n\nYou can see Rick’s wife a little more clearly in the shot on the second page.\n( He’s actually been outed as a fake btw. A catfish who does not play in the NFL!)\nAs you might imagine — Lynden trails notifications went up in flames on social media. But the HBCU educated baller, who is engaged to a black queen kept calm and simply posted THIS in response:\nFor all of the people coming to my page thinking I wrote those comments Reread! And then look at my family Black Black Black ✌ ✌ ✌ pic.twitter.com/xWgwe4HtMk \n— TEAMTRAIL✊7⃣ (@LyndenTrail7) March 16, 2017 \n\nWhat a lovely black family right? Now obviously Lynden shouldn’t have to do such a thing to defend himself. Also, he clearly states his own opinion when he posted the question in the first place — the color of the woman shouldn’t matter — it’s her behavior and how she treats her man. \nThat said, Lynden’s lady is obviously doing a great job because he went on to dedicate several more tweets to her and his daughter.
