Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 \nAlthough a spokesman for Obama issued a statement disputing the president's claims , hundreds of Trump supporters gathered outside Trump Tower in New York, demanding answers. Blaring vuvuzelas and shouting \"don't wiretap me bro,\" many said they are frustrated at the division throughout the country. \nRelated: Obama Spokesman Disputes Trump's Wiretapping Claim \nJovi Vaughn, who helped organize Saturday's rally outside Trump Tower, insisted that he's there to unite the country under the president. His message resonated across the country, from Texas and North Carolina to Colorado and Iowa.
