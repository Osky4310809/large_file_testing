It's difficult to criticise the Senegal international though when he is being so obviously played out of position. \nDF Jose Fonte, 3 -- Embarrassed by King for Bournemouth's first goal, Fonte looked ill at ease all afternoon although he was unlucky to concede the second penalty -- saved by Randolph -- on a harsh decision. Nevertheless, the former Southampton centre-half is looking anything but comfortable in his new home. \nDF Winston Reid, 5 -- Conceded the free kick that led to Bournemouth's second goal, Reid seems strangely unsure playing alongside Fonte. \nDF Aaron Cresswell, 5 -- Looked off the pace defensively all afternoon. \nMF Sofiane Feghouli, 4 -- A pointless and clumsy push on Charlie Daniels in the ninth minute led to a penalty which King obligingly drilled wide. Made amends moments later when he laid on Michail Antonio's opener and had a shot saved by Artur Borac's feet just before half-time, but that was the end of Feghouli's productive spell. Was replaced by Andre Ayew just before the hour mark and the move couldn't have been more welcome. \nMF Mark Noble, 4 -- A hugely disappointing outing by the captain who never came to grips with the midfield play. \nMF Pedro Obiang, 6 -- Another unsettled display in the middle of the park as Bournemouth swept past the Spaniard on occasions. However, Obiang stuck to the task and provided an exquisite through ball for Sam Byram to provide Ayew with the goal to make it 2-2. \nMF Manuel Lanzini, 8 -- Assured on the ball with all his good work done in the opposition half, Lanzini only needs composure in front of goal to make him a very good replacement for Dimitri Payet. \nFW Andy Carroll, 5 -- The big striker didn't get into the game at all but the wide players didn't provide him with anything to work with. \nFW Michail Antonio, 7 -- A good turn and shot for the Hammers opener after ten minutes, Antonio always looks like West Ham's best outlet. Andy Carroll was largely ineffective up front for West Ham. Substitutes \nDF Sam Byram, N/R -- Replaced Kouyate after 78 minutes and provided an assist for Ayew. It's baffling as to why Byram doesn't start in the position he slotted so well into. With the season fizzling out for West Ham, surely now is the time to put the 23-year-old in and let him show what he can do. \nMF Andre Ayew, 7 -- Scored again from the bench. Ayew is another player who needs an extended run in the starting side. \nMF Robert Snodgrass, 5 -- A substitute for Noble on 59 minutes but was just as ineffective as the man he replaced. \nPeter Thorne, aka Billy Blagg (@BillyBlaggEsq), is ESPN FC's West Ham blogger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T07:39:44.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
