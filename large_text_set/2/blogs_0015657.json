I could see exactly where that was going. I was rather happy about it,\" he said. \n\"WikiLeaks is very happy that there is a narrative about fake news out there because we have a perfect record of having never got it wrong in terms of authentications.\" WikiLeaks is very happy that there is a narrative about fake news out there because we have a perfect record of having never got it wrong in terms of authentications. Julian Assange \nSo what if that \"pristine\" information is private correspondence allegedly from one of Hillary Clinton 's top aides, released a month before the election ? Does freedom of information take on a new meaning when that information is timed to have the maximum impact? \n\"Sources don't give you stuff unless it's going to have impact,\" Assange said. \n\"The real value in WikiLeaks is it is a wonderful library that you can trust... But the library has to be marketed. And so the scandal-generation business, which we're also in -- I view that as a kind of marketing effort for what is much more substantial, which is our archive.\" \nAnd as for the timing of the Podesta emails? \n\"We try and maximize the value of the information to readers. So that's publishing it at the moment when they most want to read it, when they most want to know what it contains. And that's definitely before an election rather than after election.\" \nAssange himself is currently in election mode once more, awaiting the outcome of the Ecuadorian presidential election to learn if his status in the country's London embassy will change. But if there's one thing his Sydney audience learned, he's not shying away from scandal any time soon. On realising the internet is less interesting than Wikileaks \n\"The internet is boring. It felt like I'd read the whole internet... each new thing was kind of like the last thing. And it felt like pre-chewed food, not real, kind of lame. So I thought, 'I think I'll just read more of our stuff'.\" On living in the Ecuadorian Embassy \n\"I'm a refugee. Arguably the best known refugee.\" On living in isolation \n\"Intellectually, my mind is in the world doing amazing things. Actually, frankly amazing things.\" On the danger of releasing information \n\"Nothing that we've published has ever hurt anyone, physically... Information very, very rarely, is dangerous. And not compared to what government does.\" On the accuracy of the Podesta emails \n\"We had lots of critics in the Democratic Party, liars in the Democratic Party... saying that what we published was not accurate -- trying to imitate it, sometimes saying it directly. And of course we could mathematically prove that they were liars. And it's not every day that you can mathematically prove that your critics are full of it.\" On Australia \n\"Australia doesn't really exist as a state... It doesn't have its own land, it doesn't have its own language, it doesn't have its own foreign policy.\" On Wikileaks' Twitter account \n\"You can blame me for anything that's there -- I'm the editor.\" \nCNET Magazine : Check out a sample of the stories in CNET's newsstand edition. \nLife, disrupted : In Europe, millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle.
