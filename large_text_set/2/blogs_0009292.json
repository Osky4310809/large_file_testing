F*ck Off!” \nFacts didn’t matter. \nThe fact that the travel ban doesn’t affect most of the world’s Muslim’s didn’t matter, as Morgan observed. \nThe threat of terrorism or the security of Americans didn’t matter. \nJust shut up, you are not pushing the approved line. \nThis is why the left lost, but they still don’t get it.
