Widnes \nClubs have also complained about the headaches of organising games for the final seven rounds. \nThose Super 8s fixtures are only known after 23 rounds, which gives clubs little time to drum up publicity or ticket sales. \nWigan’s Super 8s fixture with St Helens, for example, drew in 14,000 last year when regular derbies attract well over 20,000. \nTeams finishing sixth, seventh or eighth now currently know their seasons are effectively over bar the shouting after 23 rounds. \nBut clubs who do worse and finish in the bottom four perversely have more to play for in the Middle 8s, attracting decent crowds into the bargain. \nThere are undoubtedly good points to the system and the promotion of Leigh Centurions is proof of that. \nBut there are too many other problems, including the timing of the League Leaders Shield, for the system not to be shaken up.
