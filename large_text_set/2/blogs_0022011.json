How do you assess your team’s chances?\nI am sure it will be a big challenge. This is going to be a very tough tour for our guys but we have some real match winners and some exciting new talent, so you never know.\nThis is a very aggressive Indian team under Virat Kohli, especially now when he is the captain in all formats of the game. What do you make of Kohli’s trajectory so far as captain?\nI like the way he plays the game: he is really competitive both as a batsman and as captain. Kohli always leads from the front. He is passionate and loves to win.\nHow does the Australian team plan to counter Kohli as a batsman?\nIt’s tough. He is a great player. I guess, we should just try and keep it simple, be patient, bowl as many good balls at him as possible and hope for a mistake. I am sure the Aussie team will do their homework on Kohli and come up with a plan or two but then it comes down to executing that plan over long periods of time.\nThere is always an extra edge in the air when India and Australia play cricket. How would you rate the India-Australia rivalry?\nIt’s great to have this kind of rivalry. I think both teams have a healthy respect for each other.\nWhy do Aussies sledge so much?\nNot all Aussies sledge. It’s a highly competitive environment and emotions can run high as both teams are desperate to win. So, sometimes things get said in the heat of the moment.\nWho are some of the Australians that India needs to keep an eye on?\nFrom Australia’s end, India should probably watch out for the usual suspects of David Warner, Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc. However, i feel Steve O’Keefe could have an impact in the series.\nDo you feel that Kohli is better than Sachin Tendulkar?\nThey are both great players but let’s not compare them until Kohli has finished his career.\nKevin Pietersen has advised Australia not to bother touring India if they can’t play spin. Do the Aussies have a plan to counter R Ashwin and India’s spin attack?\nWell, that is pretty obvious as the pitches generally turn and India often plays three spinners. Ashwin will be a great challenge for the Aussies and i am sure each batsman will have his own plan on how best to counter him.\nAustralia has picked a spin-heavy squad for the Indian tour. Wouldn’t you have been better off playing to your traditional strengths with pace?\nI feel we have a good squad for the conditions in India. The selectors now have options in every department and have picked the most balanced team for any conditions in India.\nHow important is this tour for Australia which is looking to regain the No 1 spot in Test rankings?\nThis is a tour that Australia has been planning for some time. It is going to be very important for us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:49:51.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
