(Photo: Universal) \nWhile on a press tour for her new film Gold , Bryce Dallas Howard took some time to talk with press about the upcoming Jurassic sequel. The actress as been confirmed to reprise her role as Claire, and that Chris Pratt 's Owen will be joining her. \nOther than a few other casting announcements, no other info has been released regarding the film. During Howard's interview with JoBlo , she let on a little about when the next film takes place. \"That's part of the story, that's part of the journey. She definitely went through a lot and is permanently changed because of that. But she is also who she is. Chris [Pratt] and I are already having a lot of fun with that. We're in that stage right now of figuring out the backstory and talking through all those beats, like everything that happened in between. That's always such a fun time. You're like, 'No, she did that?! No way, he couldn't have!' It's really, really fun, and then you step into the present moment and it becomes alive.\" When she was talking about the ideas she and Chris Pratt have been throwing around, Howard mentioned they've been figuring out \"everything that happened in between.\" Their characters left the first film on an awkward note, not really being sure where they stood with each other. The tension in their relationship lasted throughout the entire movie, so there will be plenty of work for them to do before the sequel. From the sound of that quote, it looks like a lot time will pass before Claire and Owen have to reveal what they've been up to. We knew - given that the park was shut down - that Jurassic World 2 wouldn't take place directly after the first film, but it looks like there will be a substantial amount of time in between. If director JA Bayona wants to bring in the children who acted in the first film, this time jump seems entirely necessary. What happens during that time however, is anybody's guess. \nNEXT: Jurassic World 2 Director Wants To Make A Fun Follow-up / Get Down Star Justice Smith Joins Jurassic World 2 / Bryce Dallas Howard Talks Jurassic World 2 / Colin Trevorrow Says Jurassic World 2 Will Be Scarier / Jurassic World 2 Working Title Revealed / Jurassic World 2 To Be Darker, Says Director / Jurassic World 2 Production Dates Revealed \nJurassic World 2 is being directed by J.A.
