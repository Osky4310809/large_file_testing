While ULA didn't commit to using the Blue Origin engine in its next-generation booster, its \"significant\" investment signaled it was enthused about the innovative rocket engine. However some members of Congress have been pushing ULA to use a different engine, the AR1, being developed by Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nFurther Reading Behind the curtain: Ars goes inside Blue Origin’s secretive rocket factory At the end of February, two US representatives, Mike Rogers of Alabama and Mac Thornberry of Texas, decided to push a little harder. On Feb. 28, they sent a letter to Lisa Disbrow, the acting secretary of the US Air Force, and James MacStravic, who is performing the duties of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. In addition to reiterating a desire that ULA continue to fly a second rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, the letter urges the Pentagon officials to be skeptical about the BE-4 engine.\n\"The United States Government (USG) must have a hands-on, decision-making role ... in any decision made by United Launch Alliance to down-select engines on its proposed Vulcan space launch system, especially where one of the technologies in unproven at the required size and power,\" the letter states. \"If ULA plans on requesting hundreds of millions of dollars from the USG for development of its launch vehicle and associated infrastructure, then it is not only appropriate but required that the USG have a significant role in the decision-making concerning the vehicle.\" The letter then goes on to say the Air Force should not give any additional funding to ULA, other than for current launch vehicles, until the company provides \"full access, oversight of, and approval rights over decision-making\" in its choice of contractors for the engines on Vulcan.\nOn Thursday evening a spokeswoman for ULA, Jessica Rye, said, ULA will continue to support the Department of Defense's needs. \"We will work with the Congress to resolve concerns raised in the letter,\" she said.\nPolitics Although both Rogers and Thornberry are members of the House Armed Services Committee, it is difficult to avoid ascribing at least some political motives to the letter. In January, Aerojet Rocketdyne said it would produce the produce the AR1 rocket engine in Huntsville, Ala., creating 100 new jobs near NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Already, another Huntsville company, Dynetics, has become a subcontractor for engine’s main propulsion system. (A spokesman for Rogers didn't not reply to a request for comment).\nFurther Reading One small stip(ulation) for NASA, one giant burden for exploration As part of the January announcement, another Alabama lawmaker, Senator Richard Shelby, praised the company's decision to build its engines in Huntsville. \"Aerojet Rocketdyne's announcement that it is bringing 100 new jobs to Huntsville is excellent news for our state,\" Shelby said at the time. \"I look forward to working with them and other businesses to bring economic development to Alabama.\"\nA former adviser to President Obama, whose administration sought to increase commercialization of US space flight, says this appears to be a case of elevating local politics above what's best for the the nation in space. \"This letter puts Alabama first instead of America first,\" Phil Larson, told Ars. \"NASA, the Pentagon, and our country will be better situated with a robust, diversified, and innovative commercial space industry here in the United States. By targeting an innovative partnership between established companies, this letter shows that Alabama's delegation is stuck in the past.\"\nBetter with Blue? With its workhorse Atlas V rocket, ULA has services the satellite launches for the US defense and intelligence communities for more than a decade—it was the sole provider until SpaceX was recently certified for some launches. But by 2014, as tensions between the United States and Russia were spiking due to Crimean crisis, ULA came under pressure from Congress to end its use of the Russian RD-180 engine. The engine is extremely reliable, but Congress did not want to see us using Russian technology to get our national security assets into space.\nAs ULA moved forward with development of its Vulcan rocket, it needed new engines, ones made in the United States. In addition the the Blur Origin partnership, ULA also said it was working with the California-based Aerojet Rocketdyne as a back-up option. The company has a long history of building large rocket engines, including the Space Shuttle main engines. Aerojet has since said that it is developing the AR1 engine as the option that will provide the \"lowest cost to the taxpayer.\"\nFrom the Aerojet Rocketdyne web site. Aerojet Rocketdyne That remains a questionable assertion, however, as the US government announced last year that its initial investment in the AR1 engine would cost up to $536 million. The government has not yet invested any funds directly on BE-4 development; before ULA's investment, Blue Origin had spent its own money and a couple of years developing the BE-4 engine. (The ULA funds helped scale the liquid oxygen-methane engine from a thrust of 400,000 pound-force to 550,000 lbf). Eventually, once ULA selects an engine, it's likely that government funds will support the integration of the rocket, as it will be called upon for national security launches.\nBoth the BE-4 and AR1 engines are at various stages of development. By some estimates, the BE-4 is one or more years ahead of the AR1 engine in terms of readiness for launch, and Blue Origin may begin full-scale tests within the next month.", "external_links": ["https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AR1.jpg", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/BlueOrigin_009-300x150.jpg", "http://www.rocket.com/ar1-booster-engine", "http://spacenews.com/aerojet-rocketdyne-ula-win-air-force-propulsion-contracts/", "https://www.blueorigin.com/news/news/ula-and-blue-origin-announce-partnership", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/super-strypi-failure-300x150.jpg", "http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2017/01/aerojet_hiring_100_to_build_ne.html"], "published": "2017-03-10T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:22:07.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
