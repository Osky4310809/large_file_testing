Charles Schumer (D-NY) holds a news conference following meetings between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and GOP congressional leadership at the U.S. Capitol May 12, 2016 in Washington, DC. The Senate Democrats pointed to policies they say that Trump and Republicans in Congress agree on and said they were both operating from the same textbook.

The New York Democrat, however, told Fox News there are some places he would be willing to work with Trump. \n“He called for the elimination of the carried interest loophole where these wall street guys pay less taxes than their secretaries,” Schumer said. “If he put that on the floor, we’d do it in a minute.” \nSchumer also said that his views on trade are “closer to Trump’s than Obama or Bush,” as he voted against NAFTA in 1994. \nHe added that he’d be willing to work with Trump on infrastructure if there was “real money and can build real new roads.” The Senate Minority Leader, however, complained that the White House hasn’t “sent us anything on infrastructure.” \nSchumer said Trump started out on Obamacare, which “he knew it would create partisan divisions.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T04:02:45.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
