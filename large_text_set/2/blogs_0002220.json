As NBA players launch more deep bombs in games, the spectacle of seeing the best players nail shot after shot has become more exciting.\nLast year’s event culminated in a scorching display of shots between the two Splash Brothers. Klay Thompson set the standard by nailing 27 points in his final round, and it was just enough to hold off Stephen Curry in the end. In the process, Thompson enacted his revenge on Curry after Steph came from behind to win in 2015. \nThis year Thompson will be the lone Splash Brother and defend his title against a new cast of characters. Curry was invited, but decided not to compete.\nHere are the contestants.\nKlay Thompson (21.3 points per game, .403 three-point percentage, 149 threes made) Thompson is the reigning Three-Point Contest winner, taking the victory last year in Toronto in a shootout against Curry. Though Curry has the two best three-point shooting seasons, Thompson’s last season ranks third on the all-time list. We know how good he is when he gets hot, too — 37-point quarter, anyone? \nKyrie Irving (24.2 points per game, .395 three-point percentage, 102 threes made) The 2013 Three Point Contest winner isn’t traditionally seen as a deep marksman, but just ask Stephen Curry about his three-point proficiency . He’s shooting nearly 40 percent from downtown this year, which isn’t quite as good as he shot in 2014-15, but is far better than his percentage from last year.\nKemba Walker (22.9 points per game, .402 three-point percentage, 135 threes made) Walker’s appearance in this contest demonstrates just how far he’s come. Once upon a time, three-point shooting was his major weakness. In his first four seasons, Walker failed to eclipse even a 33-percent three-point mark. But thanks to hard work and tinkering with his shot mechanics, Walker has become one of the deadliest shooters in the game, particularly when pulling up on the pick and roll.\nWesley Matthews (15 points per game, .381 three-point percentage, 129 threes made) Matthews will participate in the Three Point Contest for a second time, but the first since his Achilles injury in 2015. Ironman’s having a three-point shooting year just as prolific as the year he originally participated, shooting the same number of threes (7.4) and making nearly 38 percent. If there’s any problem, it’s that he won’t have nearly enough time to celebrate each make with his signature bow-and-arrow celebration. Maybe he’ll just have to rattle off 15 straight arrows after he finishes.\nNick Young (13.9 points per game, .424 three-point percentage, 128 threes made) The Three Point Contest is officially good because they let Swaggy P in. Of course Young is one of our favorite goofballs in the league, but he’s quietly having one of his best seasons ever with the Lakers this year. Included in his season is extremely efficient three-point shooting, making nearly three a game at a 42 percent clip. He’s absolutely deserving, asides from having one of the most infamous three-point gaffes of all time.\nEric Gordon (17.4 points per game, .392 three-point percentage, 166 threes made) Gordon is a huge part of the surprising Rockets , who have taken the league by storm this year with the perfect fit that is Mike D’Antoni. Gordon is their leading three-point shooter, even over James Harden , and he’s stayed healthy all year. Houston definitely deserved to have at least one of their shooters represented in the Three Point Contest, and Gordon certainly made the most sense. Maybe he’ll even shoot a few from 30 feet just for fun.\nKyle Lowry (22.4 points per game, .422 three-point percentage, 143 threes made) This will be Lowry ’s second appearance in the 3-Point Contest. He participated for the first time in 2016 when the Raptors hosted All-Star Weekend but was eliminated in the first round. Lowry will surely look to redeem himself in New Orleans. He’s currently averaging 23.3 points per game and shooting 42% from the 3-point line. He’s already made 162 3-pointers this season.\nC.J. McCollum (23.5 points per game, .421 three-point percentage, 120 threes made) McCollum was the first player to accept the NBA’s invitation to the 3-Point Contest and for good reason — he’s as good of a spot-up shooter as the league has to offer. Portland’s sharpshooter scored just 14 points and air-balled a shot in a first-round exit in last year’s contest, so McCollum will have to bring it if he wants to take home the trophy this time around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:17:58.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
