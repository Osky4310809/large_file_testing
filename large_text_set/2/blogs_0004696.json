But seeing that Donald Trump is a pussy-grabbing puppet boy of a politician , the House of Commons is taking back its invitation!\nOn Monday, house speaker John Bercow announced he plans on blocking the predatory POTUS from addressing Parliament when he visits the U.K. later this year.\nRelated: Trump's Team Can't Find The White House Light Switches! \nThe speaker — who is one of three people with the authority to block visiting figures — said that addressing Parliament was an \"earned honor\" and not an invitation that came with a seat of power.\nBercow said that due to Drumpf's immigrant ban , he feels \"strongly opposed\" to an address from the racist and sexist businessman, explaining:\n\"We value our relationship with the United States… However, as far as [Parliament] is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.\"\nHear, hear!\nRelated: Kanye West Is DONE With Trump! \nThe House speaker's speech was followed by a round of applause from Parliament members in the Commons, which is usually a banned practice.\nMPs and other British politicians praised Bercow's announcement. Liberal Democrat party leader Tim Farron made sure there was no confusion about Parliament \"snubbing\" Trump, saying in a scathing statement: \n\"This is the right decision by The Speaker. The Prime Minister might wish to kowtow to the nasty misogynist that now sits in the Oval Office but no-one else does. We do not want him to speak to us. He is not welcome… Trump should be under no illusion. We are snubbing him.\"\nOuch!
