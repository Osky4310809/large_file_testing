The right-hander played a poor shot, chasing a wide one from Vijay Shankar, and edged it to the wicketkeeper. Reduced to 190 for 5, Mumbai had allowed Tamil Nadu back in the game. \nWith both teams trying to snatch the first-innings lead, the standard of cricket too rose, setting up a promising contest. Mumbai, as expected, rose to the occasion to tighten their game and were able to resist Tamil Nadu's attack successfully. While Tare ensured that Mumbai didn't go into a shell, Tamil Nadu were met with some staunch resistance from Nayar. \nThe left-hander again pulled the team out of a tricky situation and was keen on frustrating the bowlers. Tamil Nadu, for some inexplicable reason, decided to stick with the old ball for 99 overs. They took it just one over before the mandatory time and tasted success soon after. \nNayar fell only after Mumbai had taken the first innings and the scorecard stood at 311 for 6. While there was still plenty of work left to be done, the left-hander fell in one of the most unluckiest ways possible. The new ball did keep low every now and then and Baba Aparajith trapped him in front with the one that rose just above the ankle, bringing an end to a magnificent stand. \nTare had looked assured in his innings and chased a wide one from T Natarajan only to hand Ganga Sridhar Raju a low catch at cover just ten runs later. With the first innings lead gone, it was crucial for Tamil Nadu to wrap things up quickly and push for a win to make it to the final. \nHowever, Balwinder Sandhu (32) and Shardul Thakur (52) were able to blunt every possible attack from the bowlers and added crucial 44 runs between them for the eighth wicket. They not only added the runs but were able to frustrate the bowlers and wear down the fielders - something that could well prove to be crucial later on in the game. \nBy the time Sandhu was dismissed, edging one behind to the 'keeper off Shankar, the lead had swelled to 60. Having spent more than 130 overs on the field, the effects showed on the bowlers as well, with all of them dishing out freebies from time to time. \nShankar was rewarded for his gritty effort and ended with a four-wicket haul while Shardul kept frustrating Tamil Nadu. The last wicket pair batted for over 15 overs before Thakur was castled by Aparajith to ensure Tamil Nadu have spent 150 overs on the field so far. \nBrief scores : Tamil Nadu 305 (Baba Indrajith 64, Vijay Shankar 50; Abhishek Nayar 4-66, Shardul Thakur 4-75) trail Mumbai 406 (Aditya Tare 83, Suryakumar Yadav 73; Shankar 4-59) by 101 runs. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T14:12:37.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
