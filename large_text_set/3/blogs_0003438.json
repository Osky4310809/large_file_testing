Featuring a 600PS version of Aston Martin's celebrated 6.0-litre naturally aspirated V12 breathing through a new quad exhaust system, it is the world's fastest and most thrilling four-door, capable of 210MPH. Resplendent in AMR's signature Stirling Green with vibrant lime green accents, riding on new 21in alloy wheels and featuring a dramatic new full height signature grille, front splitter, side sills, rear diffuser and aero flip on the rear decklid, the Rapide AMR makes a striking statement. \nExtensive use of carbon fibre detailing on the exterior provide the perfect finishing touches. The interior is equally breathtaking. Lightweight carbon fibre front seats, trimmed throughout in Dark Knight Alcantara with Lime Green accents and carbon fibre waterfall, centre console and door casings, ensure the Rapide AMR is a fabulous fusion of race car attitude with a luxurious crafted twist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:08:10.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
