Is Deluxe using the same IR3555 integrated mosfet as Extreme? Or will IR3555 only for ROG series? 2. Since Extreme already has SupremeFX, what will differentiate it from the Formula? 3. What is different between CrystalSound and SupremeFX? 4. When is Pro and Formula boards coming? Select All Posts By This User I don't have my RVE yet, but I did have a simple question. I have 2 SSD and 2 HDD from my old system. The 2 SSD (a 128GB and 256GB) ran on my older P6X58-D Premiums SATA3 in AHCI mode. The 2 HDD (Raptor 150GB 15krpm) were on the intel side configured as a raid 1. I read in the RVE manual that the SATA connections can only run in 1 mode. I.E. if set to RAID, all drives are set to RAID. I am most likely incorrect, but I thought SSDs are best run in AHCI mode? If so, The single mode of the MB might cause an issue for people wanting a setup like mine? I'm most likely wrong, or at least I hope I am. Thanks. Looking forward to my RVE and 5820K with a new Plextor M6e as a OS drive. Select All Posts By This User I'm hoping other X99 owners might be able to help me out here. I'm trying to overclock my 5960X and it's just not working with this board and I'm wondering if anyone else is seeing the same problems. In the BIOS, it is defaulting to XMP overclocking and setting the CPU to overclock to 3750 MHz. I can change all the values, in this case, I specifically just try to set the ratio from the default 28 to 34 (I've tried everything in between, too) and the vcore to 1.31v (and I've tried 1.3v). I save and exit and the system reboots and is right back to the default XMP over clock settings. I can occasionally get it to stay in default mode (not XMP) so the CPU runs at stock clocks, but usually it resets itself to XMP. I've tried updating the BIOS from 0505 to 0701 (and going back to 0505)... I've pulled the battery, reset the BIOS, tried DIP 5, etc... nothing seems to work. Am I missing a key setting or switch? Do I have a bad board? Has anyone else run across these problems?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:02:17.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
