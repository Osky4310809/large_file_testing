Clippard will only have to look at the Marine Corps Eagle, Globe and Anchor pendant, the official emblem and insignia of the U.S. Marine Corps, that he will carry with him to the WBC to understand why he is there.\n“For me, personally, as baseball players this is our Olympics,’’ Clippard told The Post on Sunday at George M. Steinbrenner Field as the Yankees came away with a 3-2 victory over the Pirates with Clippard pitching a scoreless sixth inning.\n“As baseball players this is our Ryder Cup, this is our chance to wear the USA jersey and to play for our country and to experience baseball on a level different than what we have done our whole careers,’’ Clippard explained. “I never got the chance to wear the USA jersey, this is my one chance to do it on the highest stage against the best competition. It’s a no-brainer for me.’’\nClippard will carry that Marine Corps pendant with him during all games of the World Baseball Classic. He proudly showed a picture in his phone of the pendant. Here is the story behind it:\n“My best friend growing up, Bobby Malina, we played Little League together, he was in Iraq and in the insurgence in Fallujah. Twice his vehicles were hit with IEDs, he’s got some hearing loss, but it could have been much worse,’’ Clippard said.\n“I have another close friend, Ryan Harvey, he was a first-round pick the same year I was drafted in 2003. His dad Bill served in Vietnam. He was a Marine. He gave my friend Bobby the pendant. He said, ‘Take this, this was with me my whole time in Vietnam. It will keep you safe.’\n“Bobby served four tours and came back safely. It’s the lucky pendant.\n“When I told him I was playing in the WBC he said, ‘Oh man, you should take this pendant with you,’ I was like, ‘Dude, absolutely, I would love to have that with me.’ ’’\nImagine the stories that pendant can tell, Vietnam and four tours in Iraq.\n“I think I’m going to keep the pendant in my back pocket,’’ Clippard said. “I’m going to have to Velcro it down so I don’t lose it.’’\nYour browser does not support iframes. Yes, to some players the WBC is more than baseball. Clippard left to train with Team USA in Fort Myers after Sunday’s game.\nMany players are not participating in the WBC because their major league team takes precedent. Clippard understands that line of thinking. He understands what the Mets Noah Syndergaard said the other day when he noted he did not regret skipping the WBC, not one bit. “Because I’m a Met,” Syndergaard said. “Ain’t nobody made it to the Hall of Fame or win a World Series playing in the WBC.”\n“I absolutely respect the thought process there,’’ Clippard said. “I get it. I thought about my career, is it going to affect the Yankees and if I thought the answer was yes in any way to hinder my performance during the season or my health for my career, anything like that if I thought was in jeopardy at all, I wouldn’t do it.’’\nThat’s all true. Many fans don’t want to see their team’s stars in the WBC — even though it is still spring baseball. Superstars Mike Trout and Bryce Harper are not playing.\nClippard, 32, gets all that and said each decision is a personal decision. “I think I would make this same decision if I were 24,’’ Clippard said.\nFor him, the WBC is a perfect fit, and the former Met can’t wait to wear the USA jersey.\n“Bobby and Ryan’s dad were able to represent our country in such significant ways, this is all I have,’’ Clippard said. “For me to do this once in my life, it is very meaningful for me.’’\nTyler Clippard and his Marine Corps pendant are going to represent America proudly.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T07:59:41.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
