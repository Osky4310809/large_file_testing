This will negate the job creation and job security policy being propagated by the current administration. The National Assembly’s proposed action will also not only affect recent gains made in the area of gas flaring which has reduced from 65% to less than 20%, but lead to the loss of up to $124 million annually payable as taxes and dividends to the Federal Government. \n“NLNG is a made-in-Nigeria company competing globally and has been a huge success so far. It is currently the 4th largest supplier of LNG in the world. NLNG is a pride to Nigeria and the country’s flagship company, with the model being considered for replication in various sectors of the economy. The proposed amendment of the NLNG Act is not in the interest of Nigeria and it is absolutely necessary that the Act is not amended as the imminent losses will far outweigh any doubtful gains; this is completely against what the country requires at this time and should not be allowed. It is essential that Nigeria as a country must be able to generate adequate confidence within the international investor community to sustain critical ongoing and future investment beginning with the stalled Brass and OK LNG projects,” it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T09:12:24.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
