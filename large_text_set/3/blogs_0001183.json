No one wants to get bombarded with dozens of emails every week, even if these emails are well crafted and perfectly relevant. \nMany professional outreach tools will let you see your conversation history with each of your prospects, which makes it easy to avoid being too intrusive. Buzzstream makes it easy to keep track of your blogger outreach efforts Extra tip There’s one more group of outreach prospects that I didn’t mention — “people who tweeted or linked to your own content.” Reaching out to them makes a lot of sense when you’re just starting out and trying to get some traction, but on later stages it’s better to focus on the three aforementioned groups instead. Creating a list of prospects for blogger outreach \nLet’s get back to the three groups of outreach prospects that I outlined earlier and discuss how to find them with ease. 1. People who wrote articles on the same topic \nThis one is easy. Put some keywords related to the topic of your article into Google and collect a list of articles that appear in the results. \nYou might also want to use the “Tools” functionality, in case you need to focus on “fresh” content (more on that later). \nBut copy-pasting hundreds of URLs from Google search results can be quite tedious (unless you’re good with scrapers). \nSo here at Ahrefs, we use our Content Explorer tool for that purpose. It has an easy export option along with some other useful features that will help you to narrow down your list: Use “one article per domain” feature to narrow down your list \nAs a general rule, it’s a good idea to earn backlinks from websites that have never linked to your website before. So if the list of articles is too big, you might want to use the “highlight unlinked domains” feature and only work with websites that have never linked to you before: “ Highlight unlinked domains” is a unique feature of the Content Explorer tool \nThese “unlinked” prospects should be given special care in your outreach emails because a link from them will bring more value than a link from someone who has already linked to you. 2. People who linked to articles on the same topic \nCollecting prospects from this group necessitates a backlink tool. \nSince Ahrefs is one of the leading backlink tools in the market today, we tried to make it easy for our customers by integrating backlink data into Content Explorer. \nFollow two simple steps to identify which articles in your list have the most backlinks: Set “Referring domains” to only show articles with at least 2 websites linking to them; Sort the resulting list of articles by the amount of referring domains (high to low). \nFrom there, it’s just a matter of putting the URL of each article into Site Explorer and examining its backlinks one by one to see if there’s an opportunity for outreach: \nThis can be super tedious at first, but with some experience, you get very good at identifying the most promising outreach prospects just by looking at the title of the linking page and the text that surrounds a link. 3. People who tweeted articles on the same topic \nI listed my three groups of prospects in order of decreasing effectiveness. \nSo this group is the least effective of the three, and I’ll tell you why I think so. \nPartially, it’s due to the fact that people tweet out a lot more content than they publish or link to. \nOther than that, too many people simply don’t read what they tweet : \n“ On June 4, the satirical news site the Science Post published a block of “lorem ipsum” text under a frightening headline: “Study: 70% of Facebook users only read the headline of science stories before commenting.” \nNearly 46,000 people shared the post, some of them quite earnestly — an inadvertent example, perhaps, of life imitating comedy.” \nBut that doesn’t mean that you should ignore this group of prospects altogether. \nAs with the other two groups, it’s just a matter of cherry-picking the best prospects to reach out to and investing some time to personalize your outreach. \nFinding people who tweeted a certain piece of content is quite easy. Just put the URL into a Twitter search: \nBy default, Twitter will show you the “Top” tweets, which is very convenient for outreach prospecting. But you can also click on the “Latest” tab to see everything they have. \nFor some older articles, however, Twitter won’t give you too much information: \nThis is where you can go back to Ahrefs Content Explorer and try the “Who tweeted” button: \nThis functionality is still in “beta” so we might be missing a few tweets here and there. Even so, as you can see in my example above, the beta version may still give you more data than Twitter themselves. How to set blogger outreach on autopilot \nThe three aforementioned lists of prospects represent the “existing” blogger outreach opportunities. \nHow about the new ones? \nA lot of new content is published every day, and you have to keep your hand on the pulse of your topic and reach out immediately if a new opportunity pops up. \nHere’s how to do that: 1. Mentions of relevant keywords \nSEOs and marketers have been using tools like Google Alerts for many years. \nJust put a few keywords related to your piece of content into the alerts tool of choice (there are many), and you’ll be notified whenever someone mentions these keywords online. \nDepending on the context of that keyword mention, you should decide if it makes sense to reach out to the author of that article and show them your own content. \nSince Ahrefs has the second-best web crawler after Google ( according to a third-party study ), we’ve developed our own web alerts functionality : \nBut if you’re not an Ahrefs customer, there are quite a few other tools that offer this service. Sidenote. Right now, we’re running a small internal comparison of Ahrefs Alerts vs Google Alerts vs a few commercial services to find out if there’s any difference in speed and quality. If you want to know the results of this experiment, please subscribe to our blog updates at the bottom of this article. 2. New links to relevant articles \nHere’s a fun observation. Put the URL of any article that ranks #1 in Google into Ahrefs’ Site Explorer, and you’ll see that it consistently gets new backlinks: \nFar too often, people settle with whatever is the #1 result in Google, and they rarely do any additional research. So later, when they need to reference a resource on that topic, they give that top ranking article yet another link. \nI call it a “vicious circle of SEO .” \nYou have to use that vicious circle to your advantage and monitor any new links the top-ranking results get. \nJust enter the URL of any article you’d like to keep an eye on in Ahrefs Alerts , and you will get an email notification whenever they get a new link: On the importance of timing \nHere at Ahrefs, our marketing team spends the vast majority of time working with the “new” blogger outreach prospects rather than sifting through the thousands of old ones. \nIf a person wrote/linked/tweeted something a year ago, it is unlikely that they are still interested in that same topic today. Therefore, our most sophisticated outreach email will smell “spammy”—simply because the timing isn’t right. \nBut once a brand-new opportunity lands in our inbox, we want to react as soon as possible. The topic is still fresh on the author’s mind, and he is usually very open to discussion. \nIt’s not that we completely ignore “old” prospects. We’re just very picky about who we decide to contact and ruthlessly filter out prospects that don’t look promising. On outreach objectives \nObviously, everyone is in this game for links & exposure. But if you make them your primary outreach objective, you’re going to irritate a lot of people with your impudence. \nThis is why we rarely ask people for links or tweets directly. \nOur sole goal is to make a person genuinely interested in our piece of content and read it start to finish. \nIf we reach this goal, there’s a high chance that this person will decide to share or reference our content without us even having to ask for it. \nAnd if our outreach flops, at least we won’t ruin the relationship with that person by being aggressive and pushy. Try to be more aggressive than we are \nWe’re in the “marketing for marketers” niche, where the rules of the game are much more fierce than in any other niche. \nBut if you’re doing marketing in a niche that’s not as saturated with blogger outreach as ours, I suggest you to try being more aggressive than we are. Be less picky when vetting outreach prospects; Spend more time on “old” outreach opportunities; Experiment with “weaker” outreach excuses; Be more upfront with your request for links/tweets. \nThere’s a good chance that your industry will forgive you all that. \nI know the guys at AuthorityHacker are advocating something they call “shotgun outreach,” and it works like a charm for growing affiliate websites in different niches. \nSo please treat our “extra cautious” model with a grain of salt and feel free to experiment with the boundaries of your own niche. \nThat said, I would love to hear your own experiences with outreach.

I’m going to create a checklist out of this and put it to good use for future projects. One thing that I’ve learned while doing outreach is that if you’re honest about your intentions while appealing to the prospect’s personal beliefs or motives, that can also go a long ways towards nailing a link. Genuine and thoughtful (no generic “great article” or “love your site” crap) compliments about a person’s website or blog also help quite a bit in winning them over your cause. 🙂 \nAnd if you have to email lots of blogs in a short period of time, write outreach templates that are geared towards that niche specifically and sell them on the benefits and end value that your content provides. In my experience, this approach works pretty well for infographics and visual content if you’re pressed for time. Tim Soulo \nhey Maximillian.. yeah, that’s actually a topic for an entirely different blog post.. which I actually covered a while ago. –> https://ahrefs.com/blog/outreach/ <– did you see it? 🙂 \nso in this article I didn’t share any tips on writing outreach emails, but rather showed how to never run out of quality outreach prospects 🙂 Albert Tan \nHi Tim, \nJust curious whether your team at Ahrefs is using an automated outreach software to run your outreach program. \nOr you are only using manual method? \nMy experience is like this. \nFor highly valuable prospects, it is best to manually write each and every outreach email manually. \nFor second and third tier prospects, create my own template which is unique (not to be found on the net at all — definitely not those templates which are floating on the blogs). Make it appears to be as personalize as possible. \nUnless you have a lot of time to spare you can’t possibly write personalized email to every prospect. Things get messy when your target prospects become big say few hundreds or thousands. Tim Soulo \nhey Albert.. we rely on Buzzstream heavily.. but that doesn’t mean that our outreach is highly automated.. we try to make each and every email that we send very personal.. but it starts from a template of course \nand the main reason why we use Buzzstream — we want to keep history of all our communications in one place.. so that one team member could see that another team member have already contacted this person recenly \nhope that makes sense 🙂 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:40:58.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
