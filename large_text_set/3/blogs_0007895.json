One of her victims, according to a statement read in court, said his life was upended and unrecognizable after the encounter with Marchese. \n“I became a kid who had sex with a teacher,” the statement read. “I know it’s cool to do that in some cultures, but in my world it’s now considered shameful. I became the outcast, the pervert. I was one of those people who just wanted to fit in, so this was painful.” \nThe boy’s life only improved after he left Madison, but the ordeal “burned a hole” in his soul, his statement continued. \n[A]ccording to a Madison police arrest warrant, she called the 17-year-old into her classroom and performed sexual acts on him during school hours. The warrant also indicated that the 15-year-old victim told police Marchese sent him repeated messages telling him how attractive he was, making it hard for her to concentrate in class. \nObviously I’ve written a lot of these teacher blogs. And reading this student’s impact statement just now, it hit me that I’ve never given much thought to the victims of these things. Is it possible that the boys who have sex with these women aren’t happy about it? That seeing a super attractive MILF naked and getting to put your man parts into her lady parts isn’t fun? That knowing a professional woman finds you so attractive she’d throw her career away and ruin her life just for a few minutes of casual, commitment-free sex isn’t all it’s cracked up to be? Could it be that there have been other boys like this one, who think it’s not cool and who consider it “shameful”? Are there other schools where these teenage boys who bedded down with their hot teachers are shunned as outcasts and perverts by their peers and not the heroes we always assumed they are? \nNah. Just this kid. \nThe Grades: Looks: I hate to go so far back into the Way Back Machine, and maybe I’ve been watching too much cable where the commercials are all for reverse mortgages and visiting nurse home care, but I’m getting some solid Bionic Woman out of Allison Marchese. Praise doesn’t get much higher than Lindsay Wagner comparisons, believe me. And let’s not sleep on that body. That is off the charts for a 39-year-old, I don’t care how many Pilates and Spin classes she takes. I’m marking her down only a little because she’s not as hot at my Wheelhouse Chick Emily Lofing . But she’s still no worse than a Grade: A- \nMoral Compass/Bad Judgment: Calling a 17-year-old out of his classes to give him classroom BJs. Texting butt shots to a 15-year-old. Texting him you can’t stop thinking about him. And while I didn’t include these details, the kid tried to break up with her but she said she had “Mafia ties” and he’d “never play football again” if he did. And the highlight: her husband also taught English at the same school. Practically every box checked. Grade: A \nIntangibles: I usually don’t comment on the SST’s professional ability, but if she taught that kid creative writing like that horseshit statement, she’s the best English teacher in the world. Grade: B \nOverall: A- I will not rest until I find the NSFW versions of those mirror selfies. [h/t to Rob L.] \nDo you have someone you want to see graded?
