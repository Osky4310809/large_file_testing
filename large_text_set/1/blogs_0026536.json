She hadn’t been expecting any bad news. \n“Where’s my baby?” \nPediatrician Shale Sackworth cleared his throat. “See, that’s just it—he’s alive and resting in an incubator, but there are certain… complications we need to discuss before you can see him.” \n“Complications?” She looked at her husband. “Jake, what the hell is he talking about?” \nJake Croppy meekly shrugged and nodded at Dr. Sackworth, yielding the floor to him. \n“Mrs. Croppy,” the doctor continued, “have you ever heard of ‘cranio-rectal interpolation’?” \n“Cranio- what ?” \n“Cranio-rectal interpolation, also known as Ouroboros Syndrome.” \n“What the hell are you talking about?” she asked desperately, her upper lip misting with stress sweat. \nDr. Sackworth shifted his weight from one leg to the other, cleared his throat, and continued. “It’s a dangerous congenital condition in which a child is born, eh, with his head fully inserted into his rectum.” \n“So…he was born with his head up his ass?” \n“Yes, in a manner of speaking…yes. Yes, he was. Your son was born with his head up his ass.” \nShe stared at him, her mouth hanging open. \n“It’s possible to correct this condition,” Sackworth continued, “but it will require a series of deeply invasive and possibly life-threatening surgeries. And even if the surgeries are unsuccessful, there’s nothing preventing him from having a long, happy, and fulfilling life.” \n“Are you fucking kidding me?” \n“I wish I was, Mrs. Croppy—I wish I was. The situation is not hopeless, but like I said, it’s delicate and complicated. I mean, it’s not like you can just tell him, ‘Hey—pull your head out of your ass.’ It’s a lot more complicated than that.” \n“How is he ever going to learn anything with his head up his ass?” she asked the doctor, her voice cracking. \n“But that’s just it—it’s not about learning. It’s about coping .” \nSix months later, little Todd Croppy had yet to see the light of day. He spent all of his time strapped to a bed in the nursery room his family had prepared for him at home, surrounded by an elaborately wheezing constellation of machines and clear plastic tubes and wires and IV drips. \nThe seal between his head and rectum was not airtight—there was just enough space to run tubes that pumped a constant of influx of oxygen up through his anus and into his nostrils to keep him alive. \nHis parents were tasked with monitoring him and keeping him clean. The wet, drippy feces that would leak down and around his neck required constant wiping and disinfecting. It was arduous, thankless work, and it put a strain on the couple’s marriage. \nThere were no organized support groups or public charities for cranio-rectal interpolation. There were no T-shirts or marches or slogans or Facebook memes. Although friends and family offered their token support and sympathy, the Croppys mostly had to go it alone. \nThey loved their son, even though they would probably never get to kiss him. \nAs the years ground slowly onward and little Todd reached puberty with his head still firmly lodged deep inside his rectum, word came of a miracle homeopathic procedure in India that permanently cured cranio-rectal interpolation. Rather than the risky and exorbitantly expensive Western surgeries, this was a holistic procedure that was not covered by insurance. It involved six weeks of an herbal salve that would slowly dilate the anus to the point where Todd’s head would eventually slip out of its own accord. \nArmed with an unwavering faith and the generous contributions of a family benefactor the Croppys packed their bags and headed with their son to India. \nOn the second day of the sixth week as they slept on the floor outside Todd’s dirty little hospital room, the Croppys were suddenly awakened by a loud, wet popping sound. \nThey rushed excitedly into the room, and there he was—their baby boy Todd, although hardly a baby anymore, was blinking his eyelids and looking at them for the very first time. \nCrying tears of joy, the Croppys soaked a pair of towels in warm water and began cleaning their son’s face. \n“I love you, my little morsel,” Abigail Croppy said, choking back tears. “This was so very painful, but it was all worth it.” \nThe Croppys paid their Ayurvedic doctors in cash and flew back home to America, joyous beyond words.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:00:18.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
