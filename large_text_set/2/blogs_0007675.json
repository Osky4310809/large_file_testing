Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAngry Mark Hughes has accused Tony Pulis of branding Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross a “loser” as he stoked their row with West Brom over Saido Berahino. \nPotters manager Hughes claims Baggies counterpart Pulis left a voicemail for Shawcross hitting back at the defender’s accusation that Albion had leaked news of their ex-striker Berahino’s drug ban following his January move to Stoke. \nThe warring Welshmen are refusing to let the dispute die after failing to shake hands before or after the game between their teams at The Hawthorns last week, which West Brom won 1-0. \nHughes said: “We were annoyed with a number of things about that. \n“I was annoyed with their manager ringing up Ryan on the Monday morning after the game and calling him a loser. I wasn't too happy with that, but hey-ho! Shawcross feels the Berahino news came from someone at Albion (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n\"But any number of things surrounding the game were unnecessary.” \nHughes was adamant the alleged message from Pulis was not tongue-in-cheek and claimed the West Brom boss had not answered Shawcross when the defender tried to ring back. \nAsked if the ‘loser’ remark had been made in jest, Hughes said: “What do you think? I don’t think so. \n“There was a voicemail left, and I haven’t heard it. Ryan wasn’t too pleased about it and tried to call back. But he didn’t get any answer. \n“That’s what the situation is as we sit here.” West Brom beat visitors Stoke last Saturday with a James Morrison goal (Photo: Reuters) \nPulis confirmed missed calls from Shawcross, who he has previously hailed as one of his greatest ever signings. \n“Ryan has tried to ring me since that and I will get back to him,” said the West Brom boss. “Charlie Adam, not at all. \n\"That makes no difference to me! \n\"I think people know the facts. \n\"It was a sideshow. The great thing was everybody talked about the game. That was the main show.” Pulis finally cashed in on Berahino in January after years of transfer speculation (Photo: PA) \nFormer Stoke boss Pulis brought former Manchester United youngster Shawcross to the club in 2007 and later made him skipper. \nBut the 29-year-old suggested Albion had spilled the beans over Berahino’s secret ban, and Hughes is now furious about the message he claims Pulis left for his skipper on Monday. \nBerahino was an ineffective substitute in Saturday's match, after which Hughes, Shawcross and midfielder Adam all pointed the finger at the Baggies over the leak.
