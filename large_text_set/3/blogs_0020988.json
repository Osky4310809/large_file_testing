He overthrew the leadership of the council including its Chairman, Eze Ilomuanya . \n“ A bewildered Ilomuanya approached the court in search of protection and redress. Even before Ilomuanya approached the court, agents of the state government at the behest of the state government had invaded the residence of the royal father at Block 9 Ilomuanya Drive, Civic Centre Layout, New Owerri; where his moveable assets were vandalised in a manner that gave the impression that Imo State was being ruled under a martial law.” \n“ On January 14, 2013, after nearly two years of litigation, the Federal High Court, presided over by Justice F. A. Olubanjo delivered judgement in favour of Eze Ilomuanya, granting hill the reliefs he sought. \n“ Reminiscent of our emperor, who considers himself above the law, Governor Okorocha ignored the judgement and continued to hound and harass Ilomuanya… \n“ On July 5, 2013, Justice John Okoro of the Court of Appeal, delivered the lead judgement in favour of Ilomuanya over the same issue but Okorocha in his habitual arrogance, in turn, set aside the judgement of the appellate court by refusing to obey it. \n“ The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, who is the chief law officer of the country in the APC government of President Buhari wrote Governor Okorocha through the Solicitor General, Taiwo Abidogun, advising him to obey the court orders but he has also refused.
