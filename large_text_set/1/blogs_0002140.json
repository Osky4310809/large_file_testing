Only 11 percent said they'd like to see more tweets, while 18 percent weren't sure what Trump should do. \nThe poll, conducted for the online political news source Dec. 8-12, 2016, of 614 registered Utah voters by Dan Jones & Associates, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.95 percent. \nTrump's tweeting proved powerful Tuesday, but that may not be enough to change Utahns' minds about his use of Twitter to communicate, said Jason Perry, head of the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics. \n\"I think people are still reserving judgment,\" Perry said. \"It does answer the question of whether President-elect Trump is able to influence the Republican Party. It did and it did it very quickly.\" \nIn response to a closed-door vote among the U.S. House GOP conference to make rules changes that would have put the independent ethics office under the control of lawmakers, Trump tweeted that they should be focused elsewhere. \n\"With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog their No. 1 act and priority,\" he said in a pair of tweets, urging them to focus on \"things of far greater importance.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:41:45.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
