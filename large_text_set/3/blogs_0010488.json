So we built it and it has come a long way. But I can tell you one thing: I didn’t score any goals or stop any, it is all these guys. It’s awesome and I love them.” \nThe Wildcats and the Knights were not strangers to each other before this game, as the two teams met twice during the regular season. Both games were blowouts, as St. Francis won the first meeting 6-3, and St. Ignatius won the second 7-3. \nLike their first two matchups, Sunday’s game also ended in a lopsided fashion. \nMuch like in their 4-3 victory in triple overtime against University School in the state semifinal game on Saturday, the Wildcats got off to another fast start. Just 10 seconds into the game, St. Ignatius senior forward Seth Whitney collected a missed shot and finished it in the back of the net to give the Wildcats the 1-0 lead. Sophomore forward Connor McGowan and Koehnke assisted. \n“(The goal) was huge because there was a little bit of concern about playing late last night and going three overtimes,” O’Rourke said. “We didn’t know what kind of gas we would have left in the tank, and that just gave us an instant jolt of energy and electricity.” \nLater in the period at 10:45, Koehnke gave the Wildcats their second goal. His shot hit St. Francis sophomore goaltender Jacob Coward and then snuck past him and slowly across the goal line. Freshman defender Greg Langermeier was credited with an assist on the goal. \nThe Wildcats picked up right where they left off in the first period, as they scored their third goal just 56 seconds into the second. From behind the net, Whitney passed the puck to McGowan in front of the goal, where he buried the shot to give the Wildcats the 3-0 lead. Koehnke was credited with his second assist on the goal. \n“Playing with these guys makes goal scoring easy. I love playing with them,” McGowan said. \nSt. Ignatius added another goal at 13:30 in the second period, as freshman forward Michael Boehm rebounded a deflection off Coward and hit a shot into the upper right corner. Junior forwards Billy Baumann and Bain Kurtz assisted. \nWhile the Knights had their chances in the second period, playing almost seven minutes with a power play and outshooting the Wildcats 16-7, Savarino and the Wildcats’ defense held strong. \n“In my mind, I thought if we get (a goal) in the first minute and a half to two minutes (of the power play), that’d be great,” St. Francis coach Chris Varga said. “Then all of the sudden you get one in the next half of the power play, and now we are in a ballgame. But it just didn’t go our way.” \nThe only goal that the Knights scored in the game came with 3:18 left in the third period on a power play, as senior defender Blake Storer found the back of the net. Junior forward Gabe Barrow and junior defender Tim Organ assisted. \nIn an attempt to put more points on the scoreboard, the Knights removed their goaltender and played six skaters. But Koehnke scored his second goal of the game on a breakaway with 2:23 left in the period. McGowan was credited with his second assist. \n“(Scoring a goal) is the second greatest feeling, right behind winning the game because you know that you are putting in the effort, you are putting in the work every shift,” Koehnke said. “To see it pay off in the form of goals up on the scoreboard, knowing you are helping your team, is awesome.” \nAlthough the Knights won their semifinal game 8-2 over Olentangy Liberty on Saturday and outshot the Wildcats 36-26 on Sunday, Savarino saved all but one shot. Savarino said that he couldn’t have played so well without his team’s defense. \n“My defense played phenomenal as usual. They are a great group of guys,” Savarino said. \nSt. Ignatius closes out its state championship-winning season with a record 30-7-2. St. Francis finishes 26-7-0 and as state runner-up for the first time since 1988. \n- William Kosileski is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T00:12:36.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
