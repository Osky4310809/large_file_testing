There’s a reason why this fight is happening. We’re young, we’re hungry and we’re not trying to wait around. It’s time for this to go down.” \n28-year-old Thurman was last in action outpointing Shawn Porter in June of last year. Prior to the Porter bout, the Clearwater, Florida native had stopped veteran Luis Collazo via cuts in the seventh round of their July, 2014 encounter, and had outpointed Robert Guerrero, and Leoneard Bundu, and retired Julio Diaz. \n“It’s Danny’s reputation against my reputation,” said Thurman. “We’re both prideful fighters. You’re putting two of the best together. He wants to prove that he can be a unified champion in two divisions and I’ve been waiting for this opportunity to get fights like this. I want to show how and why I’m better than my competition. Saturday night is my platform to show the world how great of a champion I am.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T02:09:42.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
