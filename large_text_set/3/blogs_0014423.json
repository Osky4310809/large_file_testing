The file contains the records of 33,698,126 people living in the U.S., he said. \nRecords include individuals’ names, job titles, corporate emails and phone numbers, as well as employers’ addresses. \nMCDONALD'S TWITTER ACCOUNT HACKED, BLASTS TRUMP \nThe identifier “netprospex contact id” that appears on every record provided a clue to the database’s origin, according to Hunt. Data management specialist NetProspex was acquired by business services giant Dun & Bradstreet in 2015. \nEmployees from a number of large corporations, including AT&T, IBM, Citigroup and Wal-Mart stores are listed in the database, although the Department of Defense is the most heavily represented organization. \n“Obviously seeing over 100k military personnel piqued our attention,” Hunt wrote on his blog. “There are over 10k unique job titles in there too, titles such as ‘Soldier’ (which was the most common with 2.7k entries), but also titles like ‘Ammunition Specialist’ (91 people) and ‘Chemical Engineer’ (32) along with the sorts of roles you'd expect in the army such as \"Intelligence Analyst\" (715) and ‘Platoon Sargent’ (670).” \nThe Department of Defense has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story from Fox News. \nHACKERS HIJACK TWITTER ACCOUNTS WITH SWASTIKAS, 'NAZI HOLLAND' MESSAGES \nIt is not clear how and when the data came to be exposed, although the leak does not appear to be the result of a hack. \n“Based on our analysis, it is our determination that there has been no exposure of sensitive personal information from, and no infiltration of, our system,” explained Dun & Bradstreet, in a statement emailed to Fox News. “The information in question is data typically found on a business card. As general practice, Dun & Bradstreet uses an agile security process and evaluates and evolves security controls to protect the integrity of our data.” \nNonetheless, experts warned that the data could potentially be harnessed for a spear phishing attack that could come, for, example, via a personalized spam email. \nFOR THE LATEST TECH FEATURES FOLLOW FOX NEWS TECH ON FACEBOOK \n“This database will be a rich source of information for the bad guys to create very compelling, targeted spear phishing attacks and increases the likelihood of recipients opening email attachments, which renders them, and their respective organizations, highly exposed to attack,” said Simon Taylor, vice president of products at email security specialist Glasswall, in an email to Fox News. \nThese sentiments were echoed by Varun Badhwar, CEO of cloud security specialist RedLock. “Even if the data that was leaked is mostly publicly available, having one large data dump makes it easier for attackers to run attack campaigns where they send mass phishing emails to the 33.7 million unique email addresses at the impacted organizations,” he told Fox News, via email. “So while it’s important to quickly investigate this specific breach and find the root cause, it’s even more important for the impacted organizations to ensure that they have tools to be able to monitor their networks for anomalous activity and stay vigilant.” \nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:12:22.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
