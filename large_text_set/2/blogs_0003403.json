(below is her Tweet after the small accident) 22 \nNo big deal, right? 23 \nWhat she didn’t know is that the hog she shot would offend a former meteorologist named Gary England. The problem being, not only has Mr. England gone on to become a half-way-powerful Vice President at “Griffin Communications” which owns “Channel 9″… Gary also has a strange love for pigs. 24 \nStrange? The following comes from an article about Mr. England which was written by “The New York Times”: \n“England was born in 1939 in a country house with no electricity, by the light of a kerosene lamp; family lore has it that his parents paid the doctor in chickens.

Cry-baby’s anger kept pouring in. Complaints about a public figure hunting came from both locals along with many complaints coming from others living out-side of OKC. 28 \nThis cute good hearted gal… 29 \n…who is willing to kiss toads for a chuckle… 30 \n…is a lover of animals… Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T20:23:50.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
