The national carmaker is currently in the midst of securing a foreign strategic partner (FSP) , and reports have placed Geely and France’s Groupe PSA as the potential candidates. \nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the Chinese automaker has pitched to Proton’s owner DRB-Hicom that it will offer the Malaysian carmaker some of its latest vehicle technologies. These include that used to design Geely models such as the GC9 sedan and Boyue SUV, and will also include small car tech it developed with Volvo, the sources revealed. \nThe latter will likely include the new Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) that will underpin Volvo’s 40-series models like the XC40 coming this year, along with a string of Geely models. The new platform has been designed with electrification already in mind, with Volvo models getting a T5 Twin Engine plug-in hybrid variant designed exclusively for it. \nThe sources added that by offering Proton some of its own technologies, Geely is looking to break into right-hand-drive (RHD) markets, tapping into these via Proton. Such a move would give the Chinese firm entry into the global RHD market, which it has no presence in currently. \nIf a Proton-Geely partnership does eventually happen, what would Proton get to share tech with? We take a look at the Chinese automaker’s available model line-up, which is quite comprehensive as the gallery list shows. \nAside from the GC9 and the Boyue that have been bandied, new models such as the GL and GS as well as the Emgrand EC7 could well be picks. Still, we’ve thrown in all the available models listed on the English version of its website to offer a better overview of the automaker and its design philosophy. \nSome of the older cars look a tad dated styling-wise, but the Boyue – which arrived on the scene at the end of last year – leads the new charge for the automaker. The SUV offers a fresh take on things, courtesy of former Volvo designer Peter Horbury, who now heads Geely’s design studios, of which there are four. The centres are located in Gothenburg, Shanghai, Barcelona and Los Angeles, and employ around 300 designers. \nBased on the photos, the interior looks premium enough, and the specifications being tossed about indicate that the Boyue is pretty loaded too – there’s an eight-inch display screen and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto in the mix, and safety kit includes lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control (ACC). \nFor the Chinese market, the 4.5 metre-long Boyue gets two engine choices. The first is a 2.0 litre naturally-aspirated unit on the base models. Paired with a six-speed manual, the mill offers 140 hp and 178 Nm. The other is a 1.8 litre direct injection turbo, which can be had in two output tunes, depending on transmission. \nOn the manual, the Euro 5-compliant 4G18TD is good for 160 hp and 250 Nm, while for the six-speed dual-clutch automatic version of the SUV, the numbers go up to 181 hp and 285 Nm. The six-speeder DCT is built by Geely’s Australian subsidiary, Drivetrain Systems International (DSI). \nIn some foreign markets, the Boyue is offered with a 2.4 litre naturally-aspirated unit, in place of the blown 1.8. Both the 1.8 litre turbo and 2.4 NA units are also to be found on the GC9 sedan (which is known as the Borui domestically), which made its debut two years ago. \nThe luxury sedan – which measures in at 4,596 mm long, 1,861 mm wide and 1,513 mm tall – is also available in a flagship 3.5 litre form, and all engine variants feature a six-speed auto transmission as the partnering drivetrain choice. Again, it all looks quite plush from the photos, and kit on this one includes LED headlamps, a heads-up display, a 13-speaker Infinity audio system, a 360 degree camera and ACC. \nThe GL sedan, GS SUV (which is available in both Elegant and Sport versions) and Emgrand EC7 feature a choice of 1.8 litre and 1.5 litre NA units, though the automaker’s new-ish 1.3 litre turbo is also available for all three vehicles. Power output for the latter in these applications range from 127 hp to 131 hp, though torque remains constant at 185 Nm. As for transmission choices, there’s a six-speed manual, six-speed DCT and a CVT on offer. \nElsewhere, the rest of the automaker’s Emgrand lineup consists of four models (five, if you count the Emgrand GT, which is lumped along with the regular Geely range), and 10 makes up the number for the standard Geely series, all working with normally-aspirated 2.0, 1.8 and 1.5 litre mills. \nWhat do you think of the Geely model line-up? Also, do you think some of these offerings will do well locally and around the region if they are assembled here in right-hand drive form?
