At this time, Fisher's autopsy report has been placed on a security hold. Just one day after Fisher's untimely death, her mother, Singing in the Rain actress Debbie Reynolds , also died from a suspected stroke at 84 years old. She will be laid to rest on Friday, according to a source, and some of Fisher's ashes will be buried with her. Also on Friday, Broadway will dim its lights at 7:45 p.m. ET in honor of the actresses. The source also tells ET that a public memorial for both actresses is being planned for months down the road. Among those expected to attend are Streep, Tom Hanks, and even Fisher's ex-husband, Paul Simon, though details have not yet been finalized.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:58:39.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
