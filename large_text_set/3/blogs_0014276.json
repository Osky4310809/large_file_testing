The result will always going to be two polar opposite outlooks, two different approaches, and the best part is that both of them kind of rock. Of course, both genders look at things differently, and, while we are in no way saying that one is better than the other, you need to accept that there are some things women rock at and they are a few that men can ace. Having spent three decades living life with men in the background, here are some lessons that I think we should be learning more from the opposite gender. Bro Code \nI've got to admit I am slightly jealous of the bro code. I am not saying all men love hanging out with men, however they are less quick to jump in and shame people for the company they keep, the clothes they wear, or the number of drinks they have. They watch out for each other, and it would be lovely for women to stop being each other's biggest enemies, and share some #GirlLove too. Over Thinking \nWomen excel at this. We love to take one thing, and think about it over and over till we drive ourselves insane. We overthink almost everything, and while at times it's good and quite necessary, we also need to stop and sometimes just keep things simple. Less Guilty \nI don't mean this in a negative way but men do tend to feel less guilty than women. Like, for example, if you have to go to a family event, you'll always end up feeling more apologetic for not turning up than say your partner, who was also at work just like you. We need to stop feeling so sorry and guilty about every damn thing. Not everything is our fault, and not everything can be fixed by us. Sense of Entitlement \nYou might agree with me on the fact that most men seem to think that they are entitled to a certain things and, honestly, I don't understand why women can't feel the same way. We work as hard as men do, we put in as much efforts as men, and so, yes, we deserve the same things in equal measure as men. I want to carry myself with an aura that seems to suggest that I've worked hard to be where I am, and I deserve every good thing that there is. And, more money. Equal pay, all the way. Never fail to fight for your fair share of moolah.
