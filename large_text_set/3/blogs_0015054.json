Though he has had his fair share of career flops ( Gigli , Live By Night ), the Oscar-winning director and leading man has enjoyed the type of acclaim reserved for just a lucky few. \nBut Affleck is also a human being, and a recent Facebook post he shared in which he detailed his recent struggles with alcoholism served as a stirring reminder that Affleck can be as vulnerable as any of us.
