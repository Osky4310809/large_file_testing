Among other things, the act is intended to combat forced labor and slavery. The lawsuit seeks “more than $5 million” in damages for as many as 60,000 detainees who performed sanitation chores like cleaning toilets without pay over the past decade. \nThe lawsuit also accuses GEO, which runs numerous detention facilities and prisons across the U.S., of unfair enrichment at the expense of 2,000 detainees paid $1 a day for work such as preparing food and doing laundry during the past three years. \nGEO claims that its work program is voluntary and that it employs agency employs several full-time, on-site contract monitors to ensure compliance with ICE guidelines, spokesman Pablo Paez said in an e-mail Thursday. \n“We have consistently, strongly refuted these allegations, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend our company against these claims,” Paez wrote. “The volunteer work program at immigration facilities as well as the wage rates and standards associated with the program are set by the federal government.” \nThe lawsuit was originally filed on behalf of Alejandro Menocal, Marcos Brambila, Grisel Xahuentitla, Hugo Hernandez, Lourdes Argueta, Jesus Gaytan, Olga Alexaklina, Dagoberto Vizguerra and Demetrio Valerga. It accuses GEO of threatening to put detainees in solitary confinement for up to three days if they don’t work. \nDetainees claim that compulsory duties under GEO’s sanitation policy, such as mopping floors and cleaning toilets and showers, fall outside the scope of ICE‘s personal housekeeping requirement. They receive no pay for these duties and should be compensated, according to the lawsuit. \nGEO claimed that none of the detainees have ever been placed in solitary confinement for refusing to clean and that the federal trafficking act applies to human trafficking in the sex trade. \nKane said it is irrelevant that none of the detainees had ever been placed in solitary confinement “since the forced-labor statute includes threats.” \nKane’s certification means that all current and former detainees at the Geo facility were automatically added as members of the class. \nClass actions are an exception to the rule that litigation is conducted on behalf of individuals, Kane noted. In order to certify this case as a class action Kane found that the potential plaintiff pool is unmanageable in size, that the cases are sufficiently similar and that attorneys can adequately protect all members of the class. \nThe judge noted that members of the class are impoverished and it would be unlikely that they could hire an attorney. Kane previously refused to summarily dismiss the lawsuit when it was first filed in 2014 against GEO and similar immigrant detention facilities across the country. \nKane certified the lawsuit as a class action in part because of the similarities between immigrant detainees. \n“All share the experience of having been detained in the facility and subjected to uniform policies that purposefully eliminate nonconformity,” Kane wrote. “The questions posed in this case are complex and novel, but the answers to those questions can be provided on a class-wide basis.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:54:36.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
