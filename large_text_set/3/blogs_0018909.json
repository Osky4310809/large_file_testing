(And remember, this is before cable.) But it was “The Gong Show,” which he launched in 1976 and wound up hosting, that made his name known to many Americans. It was part talent show, part spoof of a talent show featuring randos without any talent, and utterly wacky. The AP explained: \nAdvertisement \n\nPatterned after the Major Bowes Amateur Hour show that was a radio hit in the 1930s, the program featured performers who had peculiar talents and, often, no talent at all. When the latter appeared on the show, Barris would strike an oversize gong, the show’s equivalent of vaudeville’s hook. The victims would then be mercilessly berated by the manic Barris, with a hat often yanked down over his eyes and ears, and a crew of second-tier celebrities.\nThe Washington Post notes that his efforts earned him an array of unflattering nicknames: “The King of Schlock,” “The Baron of Bad Taste” and “The Ayatollah of Trasherola.” Harsh, but pretty hard to mount a counterargument when your show aired this:\n\nFor what it’s worth, Salon explained in 2001 that the “Popsicle Twins” weren’t necessarily supposed to make it onto the show:\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:29:40.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
