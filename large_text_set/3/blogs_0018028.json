Diakiese, who improved his record to 12-0, threw two stunning spinning teakwood kicks within the first five seconds of the fight, forcing Packalen to strike immediately at close range. This proved to be a fatal mistake, as Diakiese dropped Packalen with the next punch, sending him to the floor sleeping. \nSEE ALSO: This is 2017's Knockout Of The Year \nThe fight lasted all but 30 seconds, but I'm sure for Packalen it felt much longer. OHHHH M !!!! @Marc_Diakiese STIFLES Packalen w/ a right hand in the FIRST ROUND! What. A. KO!!! #UFCLondon pic.twitter.com/c9wPu0j1uW \nAnd if that KO wasn't enough, check out Jimi Manuwa’s walk-off knockout of Corey Anderson! And that's that!!!!

In what would be Pickett’s last fight, he was knocked out by his opponent, Marlon Vera. O THAT'S IT! @ChitoVeraUFC spoils Pickett's finale and gets the head kick KO! #UFCLondon on @UFCFightPass NOW! pic.twitter.com/f8XcslXu9Q", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:27:24.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
