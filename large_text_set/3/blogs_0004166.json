Jeff Sessions says under oath that he has not had any contact with Russia \nAccording to the New York Times report – which cited a handful of anonymous official sources – some Obama administration officials feared intelligence about the reported election interference could be covered up or destroyed after the Republican leader took control. \nMr Obama's staff reportedly asked pointed questions at intelligence briefings, knowing the query would be recorded, while intelligence agents rushed to analyse information. These reports were then deliberately classified with the lowest security clearance possible, so they could be seen by a large number of people. \nThe news emerged amid fresh information that officials in the Trump administration had been ordered by the White House counsel’s office to keep any intelligence of Russian interference intact. \nMr Trump’s White House spokesperson Sean Spicer dismissed the revelations about Mr Obama's staff. “The only new piece of information that has come to light is that political appointees in the Obama administration have sought to create a false narrative to make an excuse for their own defeat in the election,\" he said. \nA spokesperson f or Mr Obama, Eric Schult z, said it was standard practice to thoroughly document the information. “This situation was serious,\" he said. \nThe discovery comes asAttorney General Jeff Sessions faces pressure to resign over his ties to Russia . \nMr Sessions, an early supporter of Mr Trump, did not disclose two conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the US during the Presidential campaign. \nThe 70-year-old was asked at his confirmation hearing in January if “anyone affiliated” with the campaign had been in contact with the Russian government. \nMr Sessions said: “I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.” Richard Nixon's former lawyer warns Donald Trump over Russia cover-up \nJustice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said on Wednesday night that “there was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer.” \nThe scandal about contact between Trump associates’ and Russia has shown little sign of relenting since the CIA, FBI and the director of national intelligence, concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 in part with the aim of getting Mr Trump into the White House. \nThe story re-erupted with the forced resignation of national security adviser Lt Gen Michael Flynn, after it emerged he allegedly discussed lifting sanctions on Russia before he entered office. \nPressure on the White House has been mounting, with the FBI conducting a wide-ranging investigation into Russia’s hacking of the election, and is looking at links between Mr Trump’s associated and Moscow.
