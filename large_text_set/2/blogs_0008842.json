He became a citizen in 2000. \nHe wrote a piece for NPR last month in opposition to President Donald Trump’s travel ban. \nAskaryar is featured prominently in this video of the incident, holding a Black Lives Matter sign, yelling, “Shame!” \nFrom Politico: \nAskaryar, who entered his plea on Saturday in Superior Court in Washington, was given “several lawful orders” to move out of the way of a vehicle, and then pushed an individual identified as “V-1.” Listed as a factor under one of the charges is “impeding/assaulting US government cabinet member.” \nAskaryar pled not guilty. \nIt’s not clear exactly who Askaryar allegedly assaulted. He was involved with a scuffle, blocking DeVos at the school steps, but he also was involved with pushing back and forth with police who were trying to clear the way for DeVos’ car to get into the school parking lot. \nBut it’s good that someone was charged in this incident. \nIt’s long past time when protesters start to pay the piper when their actions cross the lines.
