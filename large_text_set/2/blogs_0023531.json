Bannon discussed the three most important goals the White House is working towards at CPAC 2017: homeland security, economic nationalism, and \"deconstruction of the administrative state.\" \"Every business leader we've had in is saying not just taxes, but also the regulation,\" Bannon said. \"I think the consistent, if you look at these Cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason and that is the deconstruction-- the way the progressive left runs, is if they can't get it passed, they're just gonna put in some sort of regulation in -- in an agency. That's all gonna be deconstructed and I think that that's why this regulatory thing is so important,\" he said. BANNON: I think the -- I think the same thing; I think if you look at the lines of work, I kind of break it up into three verticals of three buckets. The first is kind of national security and sovereignty and that's your intelligence, the Defense Department, Homeland Security. The second line of work is what I refer to as economic nationalism and that is Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Steven Mnuchin at Treasury, Lighthizer at -- at Trade, Peter Navarro, Stephen Miller, these people that are rethinking how we're gonna reconstruct the -- our trade arrangements around the world. The third, broadly, line of work is what is deconstruction of the administrative state. And if you... So I think -- I think the three most important things, I think one of the most pivotal moments in modern American history was his immediate withdraw from TPP. That got us out of a trade deal and let our sovereignty come back to ourselves, the people, the mainstream media don't get this, but we're already working in consultation with the Hill. People are starting to think through a whole raft of amazing and innovative, bilateral relationships -- bilateral trading relationships with people that will reposition America in the world as a -- as a fair trading nation and start to bring jobs. High value added, manufacturing jobs, back to the United States of America. On the -- on the national security part, it was certainly the first -- I think the first two E.O.s that you start to see implemented here of the last couple of days under General Kelly. And that is, do rule of law is going to exist when you talk about our sovereignty and you talk about immigration. General Kelly and Attorney General Sessions are adamant -- you know, that and you're gonna start to see I think with the defense budget we're going to talk about next week when we bring the budget out and also with certain things about the plan on ISIS and what General Mattis and these guys think I think you'll start to see the other part of that. But the third, this regulation. Every business leader we've had in is saying not just taxes, but it is -- it is also the regulation. I think the consistent, if you look at these Cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason and that is the deconstruction, the way the progressive left runs, is if they can't get it passed, they're just gonna put in some sort of regulation in -- in an agency. That's all gonna be deconstructed and I think that that's why this regulatory thing is so important.
