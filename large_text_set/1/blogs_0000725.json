The driver remained at the scene and was later taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for minor injuries.\n\"At this time no charges have been filed,\" Chief Tom Murray said, according to the Delaware County Daily Times. \"We will wait to see what the investigation shows before any such decision is made.\"\n\"This is a very dangerous area to cross, especially at night when it is dark,\" Murray added. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Locke family on their tragic loss.\"\nThe Lockes, referred to as the \"patriarch and matriarch\" of Melrose Avenue by their neighbors, were known to hold hands wherever they went.\n\"I still can't believe it,\" Rich Caesar said, adding that James was a frequent volunteer at the Catholic Youth Organization.\nFellow neighbor Jeane Vetter said they live in a tight-knit community that won't be the same now that the Lockes are gone.\n\"They kept an eye out for all of us. They were great neighbors,\" Vetter said. \"It's such a tragedy. It's a huge loss for everyone.\"\nJames and Eileen had raised seven children in their home on Melrose Avenue. In an email to Philly.com, one of their daughters said the family was \"heartbroken\" but grateful for the \"outpouring of love and support\" they have received from the community.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T19:42:20.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
