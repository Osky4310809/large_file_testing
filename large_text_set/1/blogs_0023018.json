From her experimental eye make-up to her captivating hairdos, we want to emulate every look she creates. But, have you seen her bridal looks? Her brides look enchanting. These are the looks we think you can try for your big day. Princess hair \nShe is known for her complex hairdos. Just look the charm of these effortless waves, perfect for a day celebration. We love the effortless waves interwoven with these quaint little flowers. We want to try it now.

They go exceptionally well with smokey eyes. So, it's best you start practising now. A video posted by namratasoni (@namratasoni) on Dec 13, 2016 at 5:40am PST Soft make-up \nSometimes, less is more. It's not necessary that you have to cake on products to look your best. Take a look at this bride with a winged liner (with false lashes, of course) and a pinkish nude matte pout.

You can always experiment with different colours. But make sure not to go overboard. Bluish-grey smokey eyes look extremely enchanting, and you can pair them with a bright coral lipstick. A photo posted by namratasoni (@namratasoni) on Jan 14, 2017 at 8:44pm PST Fairytale look \nLong curls cascading over the shoulders, paired with a classic black smokey eye and glistening nude lipstick, is a must for your cocktail party. Namrata wants you to blend-in your eye make-up, so that you don't leave any stark edges.
