Like the sweet milk at the bottom of a bowl of Frosted Flakes, cereal milk ice cream will shatter your brain and leave your tastebuds screaming like Tony the Tiger.\nNow one of the biggest ice cream chains in the world is hopping on the “they’ great!” ice cream trend. Ben & Jerry’s is now making three flavors of cereal milk ice cream — “Fruit Loot” a la Fruit Loops and Fruity Pebbles, “Cocoa Loco” a la Coco Puffs/Coco Krisps, and “Frozen Flakes” a la Frosted Flakes.\nThere’s a catch — You have to hit up a Ben & Jerry’s scoop shop for the cereal milk flavors. So you can’t just wander into 7/11 at 2AM and expect to find them digging through their freezer.\nI know. I’m bummed about that too.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:46:15.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
