That its acts are against the Sino-Indian Agreement on Political parameters and Guiding Principles for the settlement of the Boundary Question of 2005 does not bother the policy makers of China. \nDai Bingguo the former Special Representative for boundary talks with India in an interview with a Chinese magazine China-India Dialogue said, “The disputed territory in the eastern sector of the China-India boundary, including Tawang, is inalienable from China’s Tibet in terms of cultural background and administrative jurisdiction. The major reason the boundary question persists is that China’s reasonable requests [in the east] have not been met. If the Indian side takes care of China’s concerns in the eastern sector of their border, the Chinese side will respond accordingly and address India’s concerns elsewhere.” He went on to add that even the British had accepted that Tawang belonged to China. This is a blatant lie as Tawang is 37 kilometre south of McMahon Line. \nSignificantly he blamed India for refusing to accept China’s “reasonable requests” for a border compromise was the reason why the boundary problem had proved to be so intractable. “If the Indian side takes care of China’s concerns in the eastern sector of their border,” Dai said, “the Chinese side will respond accordingly and address India’s concerns elsewhere.” \nThis interview of Dai Bingguo was against the Article VII of the 2005 Agreement. The provision states, “In reaching a boundary settlement, the two sides shall safeguard due interests of their settled populations in the border areas.” The term “settled populations” certainly excluded Tawang. In addition the Article IV states, “The two sides will give due consideration to each other’s strategic and reasonable interests, and the principle of mutual and equal security.” By demanding Tawang China is going against the letter and spirit of the 2005 Agreement. \nThat China is ignoring our strategic and reasonable interests along the border. It has increased its military strength in Tibet- an area which they occupied in 1959 and is constructing a China Pakistan Economic Corridor in our region which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan. China has no qualms in going against Indian interests but when China goes against International norms it desires no country should raise objections as that is against the Chinese interests. In South China Sea it has not only rejected the Arbitration Tribunal’s ruling but continues to construct artificial islands there. It has recently indicated its plans to construct more artificial islands including at the Scarborough Shoal which it has illegally snatched from the Philippines. \nChinese double talks are very well known. They have no hesitation in changing their goal posts whenever they find it convenient. India should take care of Chinese attempts to indulge in coercive diplomacy to put pressure on India. First, India should also make it clear to China that our acceptance of Tibet as an Autonomous Region of China was conditional on the grant of real autonomy in the region by China. However, as the Tibetans are subjected to atrocities and denied autonomy, India is compelled to reconsider its approach towards Tibet. Reciprocity must be the guiding principle hereafter in India’s response to the Chinese demands on the status of Tibet. India should in a nuanced manner try to reclaim its leverages on the Tibet issue. India should not hesitate to express concern over the violation of the human, cultural and religious rights of the Tibetan people, not only in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, but in other states with significant Tibetan population. In view of our close links with Tibetans, we should help them in drawing attention of the International Community towards the human rights violation in Tibet. This is our obligation and responsibility to a population which is culturally, historically and religiously close to us. Second, our concerns on the Chinese activities and projects in Pakistan occupied Kashmir should be effectively communicated. The border level talks under the present conditions do not make any sense. There should be no hesitation in communicating our concerns boldly both in bilateral and global forums. Third, on the visa issue, India should adopt reciprocity. If China keeps on issuing stapled visa for people of Arunachal Pradesh and J&K, India should start giving stapled visas to people of Tibet, Xinjiang-Uyghur Autonomous Region, and Inner Mongolia etc. \nIndian policy makers should clearly asses the Chinese approach towards India to craft a suitable policy towards China. Three trends are discernible in the Chinese policy towards India. At one level it desires further deepening of economic relations with India. Trade between the two countries has been expanding annually at 15 percent since 2007. Chinese exports are more than its imports from India. In the Financial year 2015-2016, China exported goods worth $ 61.7 billion to India and imported goods worth only $ 9 billion from India. India remains an important market for the Chinese goods and is also now a crucial centre for Chinese investments. Hence, China desires cooperation with India in economic field and often projects its willingness to give concessions. It is important to note that China’s cooperative strategy in economic field is aimed not only to retain an important market but also at inveigling India into accepting that economic relations between the two countries are far more valuable than India’s demands on the borders and other issues. At the second level, the Chinese diplomacy is geared to check India’s rise as a power through the encirclement of India with the help of Pakistan as also other countries in our neighbourhood. At the third level, its military and diplomatic strategy at the Sino-Indian border is aimed at denying India any advantage in border negotiations. India needs to keep the objectives of the Chinese economic cooperation proposals, diplomatic manoeuvres and its military strategy as also potentials of leverages that India has over China in its strategic calculus while formulating its China policy. The obvious challenge to the Indian policy makers is to skilfully manage the Chinese pressures and move to achieve its core objectives by building strategic leverages.
