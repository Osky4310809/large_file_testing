David Carnoy/CNET \nJBL has taken its Pulse Bluetooth speaker and its built-in light show to the next level, making the speaker fully waterproof and improving the sound. \nI got a chance play around with the upcoming Pulse 3 for a few minutes here at CES 2017 and while it's hard to tell how much better it sounds, it does look a lot different from its predecessor (the Pulse 2 ), which I liked a lot. The mesh grill is gone and the speaker has a tough semi-transparent outer plastic shell. It looks even more like a digital lava lamp. \nOne of the key new features is that it's fully waterproof, which means you can drop it in the shallow end of a pool at night and get some really cool effects for a short period of time (an IPX7 certification means that you can submerge it in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes). You won't get any sound out of it if it's underwater -- Bluetooth doesn't transmit through water -- but you can't have everything. \nThe Pulse 3 carries a list price of $200 (which roughly converts to Â£162 and AU$274) and hits stores this spring. We'll have a full review as soon as we get our hands on a review sample.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:49:57.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
