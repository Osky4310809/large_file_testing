He put up a lot of numbers. Bill [Parcells] said that he was a disruptive force. Jerry [Jones], who’s probably one of the most easy-going people when it comes to disruptive guys, got rid of him. I’ve gotten texts from people in Philadelphia responding to the campaign saying, ‘This guy was a cancer and destroyed our football team.’ How does that square with the Hall of Fame?\"\nOwens was in the league for 15 seasons. He played with the 49ers, Eagles, Cowboys, Bills, and Bengals. \nSeven of those seasons, Owens had more than 13 receiving TDs ... only two other players have ever had more than three such seasons.\nEight of those seasons included making it to the playoffs — in 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2007.\nNine of those seasons had him posting more than 1,000 receiving yards.\nHe was a Pro Bowler six times, and first team All-Pro five times as well.\nWe gathered more of Owens’ stats in this post . It also includes some of Owens’ antics, on and off the field. Some of those actions certainly earned him criticism, but were they actually making teams worse?\nOwens himself doesn’t think so, and he’s got people who will back him up.\nA better question for Mr. Polian, what didn't I do to make my teams better?! Before u answer, ask Coach Sherman, Stewart, Culley or Jim Mora https://t.co/fEC399x66J \n— Terrell Owens (@terrellowens) February 27, 2017 When you look at Owens’ numbers, it’s hard to see exactly how he “destroyed” the teams for which he played.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:25:46.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
