Now, Toyota Germany has introduced a limited edition of the sports car called ‘Tiger’. \nNo mechanical changes, so the Tiger won’t be any more fearsome than a regular facelifted 86 . It might look slightly more menacing, though, with a “Tiger Orange” paintjob contrasted by black stickers that wrap around the windows and faux engine vents. The rear spoiler is also in black and the 17-inch multi-spoke rims follow the dark theme. The wheels are suspended by Sachs sports dampers. \nInside, the Tiger 86 sports Alcantara seats with suede leather inserts on the doors and dashboard. As expected, one also gets contrasting orange stitching and a “GT86 Tiger” plaque to set their limited edition Toyota apart. Only 30 will be made available for the German market. \nEnough of the 86 SEs, time for a sequel of The Three Brothers already!
