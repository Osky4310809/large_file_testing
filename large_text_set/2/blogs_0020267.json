Kai Havertz - as young as he looks (Photo: Rex Features) \nHavertz is 17 years old. He's a midfielder. He is a regular for Germany under-17s. He started for Leverkusen in their 4-2 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League Last 16. And, most significantly for this story, he was born on 11 June 1999. \nThat epic Champions League final between United and Bayern was played on 26 May 1999. \nWhich means Havertz WAS NOT EVEN BORN when Man United sealed their unique treble. \"Football, eh? Bloody hell…\" (Photo: AllsportUK) \nIf that disturbing fact doesn't make you feel ancient, this should just about finish you off. \nKylian Mbappe is the young Monaco striker/new Thierry Henry who is currently the talk of European football after his stellar Champions League performance against Man City.
