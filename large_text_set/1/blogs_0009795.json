(CBS) — New Hampshire State Rep. Carolyn Halstead shows how she accidently dropped her loaded handgun on the floor of a packed public committee hearing meeting at the State House in Concord. \nHalstead said she was rushing in to take her seat when the gun holster got caught on her backpack. \n“When I wear that particular holster, I carry in the middle of my back and the backpack must have gotten caught on it. When I squatted down and I took it off, it went like this and it came out,” State Rep. Halstead said. \nInside the room was a mother and two children. \n“Panic, like, ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t believe this happened and I need to make sure everything is safe,’” Halstead said. \nAlthough the gun was loaded, Halstead says she had all of her safety features on so the gun would not have gone off.

Unfortunately, proper control was not exhibited in this instance. I have impressed upon her that, while no harm came from this incident, her lack of control is unacceptable.” \nHalstead agrees and was deeply apologetic. \n“I agree it shouldn’t have happened,” Halstead said. \nCurrently, it is legal to allow guns in the State House and in legislative office buildings. Halstead said she plans to make some changes to make sure this doesn’t happen again. \n“I’m not going to wear the backpack with that holster. I have to find a different holster for that backpack,” Halstead said. \nA second-term representative from Milford, Halstead said she always practices gun safety and was glad she handled the incident quickly and calmly. \nPaul Burton Follow Follow Paul on Twitter Paul Burton is a general assignment reporter for WBZ-TV News.
