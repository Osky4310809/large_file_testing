Both units are set to go on sale this Friday, March 24 alongside the iPad and iPhone 7 (Product)RED Special Edition and will be priced at $399 and $499, respectively.\nThe new storage sizes will replace the 16GB and 64GB variants that were introduced last year. The firm’s already removed the original versions from its online store, so those still hoping to pick one up (we’re not sure why you’d want to, either) have no choice but to resort to third-party channels, like Amazon and eBay.\nThe new models sport the same specs As you’d expect, the Apple hasn’t made any other tweaks to the internals of the iPhone SE. It still lacks a 3D Touch display and sports a 1.84GHz dual-core A9 chip (on par with the iPhone 6S), a 12MP rear-facing camera, a 1.2MP selfie shooter and a 1,624mAh non-removable battery.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:17:33.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
