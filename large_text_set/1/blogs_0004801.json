I looked at all my options, and of all of them the best was Jaguares. It’s that simple. That’s why I came here. The idea is to keep playing, to always be seen by [Mexico national team] coach [Juan Carlos] Osorio.\" \nFormer MLS MVP Mike Magee announces retirement \nAfter playing for one of Mexico's biggest clubs for five years, Munoz now moves to a club that finished last in Liga MX in the recently concluded Apertura and struggled to pay its players on time. The veteran shot-stopper is ready to speak out if necessary, but believes that the team's affairs are now in order. \n\"I’m confident that everything will go well, that it will go according to what they’ve established in every one of the players’ contracts,\" he said. \"I hope there won’t be any need to speak up and have to go to the press. Really, I’m confident that all the payments and all the situations will happen in an orderly and on-time fashion.\" \nThere's still a chance the goalkeeper, who lived in California during his youth and speaks English, could make a MLS move after playing out the five-month Clausura with Chiapas. AS Mexico reported in December that the goalkeeper will join Orlando City after all, but the move won't happen until the summer when his loan expires.
