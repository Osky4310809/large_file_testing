But if you can already shoot and want something unique, then by all means buy a Leica — like the company’s latest, the M10 — which costs about as much as a Ducati motorcycle.\nHistorically, M series cameras have been credited with image quality, lenses and aesthetic that can’t be found anywhere else. With the M10, I found this to stay true, mostly. \nPrice as Reviewed: $6,495 body-only, $4,995 for f/1.4 35mm lens, $529 for Visoflex (Type 020) Using It \nTo be able to use a Leica camera effectively, you need to know all your manual camera controls — apertures, shutter speeds, focusing, ISO, exposure compensation and white balance. Autofocus isn’t available on the f/1.4 35mm Summilux lens, so it’s all up to your trained eye and focus peaking (an AF assist available in settings). \nOf course, since Leicas have such high price tags, the market is about the brand die-hards who shoulder the costs. Leica knows that, so catering to photographers who want a straightforward user experience was once of M10’s objectives. \nThe controls of the M10 are dead simple: a D-pad, scroll wheel, ISO dial, shutter speed dial, shutter button with on/off switch, an optical viewfinder/rangefinder and a trifecta of Live view, Play and Menu buttons. \nThat’s all you get for nearly $11,000 — no touchscreen. But in reality, that’s all you really need for taking photos on an interchangeable lens camera. Plus, five frames-per-second continuous shooting, a 2GB buffer for RAW and JPEG files and a new Maestro II image processor makes life a little easier and faster. \nFor a little extra ($545, in fact), Leica will sell you the Visoflex (Typ 020), a 2.4MP electronic viewfinder (EVF) so you can see the world as you would through the screen, including real-time changes of settings. It made shooting for the eye-perspective slightly easier for me, considering vision correction, and feel more intuitive. The Visoflex also includes a GPS module, so those of you who like geo-tagging can get to it. l1010051", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:23:46.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
