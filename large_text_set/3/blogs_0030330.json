Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president, has asked Michel Barnier, a former French foreign minister, to head the commission’s team. The European Parliament has appointed Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, as its Brexit negotiator. The two sides have very different views on the timing and sequencing of the talks. Mrs May wants the divorce and the new trading relationship to be negotiated in parallel, and reckons both can be sorted out within two years. Mr Barnier says the divorce must come first—he is already talking of a €60bn ($65bn) exit bill for Britain to pay its share of outstanding liabilities—and the long-term trading relationship, which may take more than two years to agree, second. Another complication is that several countries face elections this year, including France in May and Germany in September. That could further shorten an already tight timetable. Article 50 puts the rest of the EU in a stronger bargaining position than Britain, not least because of its two-year deadline. In an effort to shore up her position, Mrs May has insisted that no deal would be better than a bad deal. But other EU leaders disagree. If Britain were to leave the EU without a deal, it would still face demands for money, and its trade would revert to normal World Trade Organisation terms, which would imply tariffs on exports of cars, car parts, pharmaceuticals, farm products and much else, as well as non-tariff barriers for financial and other services. It is true that the rest of the EU would suffer from such a chaotic Brexit, but Britain would suffer more. If she is to secure a mutually beneficial deal, Mrs May will have to soften her demands more than her fellow EU leaders will have to.
