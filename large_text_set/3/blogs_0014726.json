Sometimes she would get paid fat. Sometimes nothing. \nBut sometime after the Manny Pacquiao fight, Chef Q says her relationship with Floyd fell apart and she doesn't really know why ... but she has her theories. \n\"I don't think he's ever looked at me past as just a gay person or a lesbian.\" \nChef Q says some comments that were made during her time with TMT were hurtful and felt homophobic. \nStill, Chef Q says she wants to have a relationship with Floyd moving forward -- she considers him family ... but knows they have to work out their issues.\nWe reached out to Floyd's camp.
