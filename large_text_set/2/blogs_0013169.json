Maher also took issue with Scahill for describing some of the Real Time hosts talking points about Islam and Muslims as vitriolic. In a statement provided to EW , Maher said: \n“My comments on Islam have never veered into vitriol. Liberals will continue to lose elections as long as they follow the example of people like Mr. Scahill whose views veer into fantasy and away from bedrock liberal principles like equality of women, respect for minorities, separation of religion and state, and free speech. If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims — and he might be — nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night.” \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:22:39.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
