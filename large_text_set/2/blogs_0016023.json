(Photo: Bobby Bank) 22 CONNECT 8 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFormer star of The Partridge Family David Cassidy revealed that he is suffering from dementia. \nCassidy's representative, Jo-Ann Geffen, confirmed to USA TODAY Monday that Cassidy, 66, has been battling the memory-destroying brain disorder. \nThe former teen idol told People his family has a history of dementia and he always â€œknew this was coming.\" \nCassidy said he is no longer touring as a musician so he can focus on his health and happiness. \nBut what does a dementia diagnosis mean for Cassidy? Here's a few common questions about dementia. What is dementia? \nDementia is a general term for memory loss or loss of mental abilities that interfere with daily life, according to Esther Oh, associate director of the Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer's Treatment Center. \n\"Dementia is an umbrella term,\" Oh said adding that information on what form of Dementia Cassidy has hasn't been released. \"If you are diagnosed with dementia, he could have Alzheimer's, or he could have dementia from a small stroke like vascular dementia, there is also a dementia that affects younger adults called frontotemporal dementia.\" \nDementia addresses symptoms, which may include memory loss, personality changes, confusion and disorientation, anxiety, difficulty planning and organizing or handling complex tasks, according to Mayo Clinic . \nWhile some symptoms of dementia may be the cause of medication or deficiencies, and be reversible, others like Alzheimer's disease are not, according to Mayo. What's the difference between Alzheimer's disease and dementia? \nAlzheimer's disease falls under the dementia umbrella, along with Vascular dementia, which often occurs after a stroke. \n\"Alzheimer's is the most common type of dementia in the U.S. and right now cannot be cured, but there are certainly a lot of pharmaceutical companies working on a cure,\" Oh said. \nAlzheimer's typically develops slowly and gets progressively worse over time, but the trajectory for how long someone may live with the disease differs for each person, Oh said. \nAfter age 65, the risk of Alzheimer's doubles every five years. After age 85, the risk reaches nearly 50%, according to the Alzheimer's Association. What is early onset Alzheimer's disease? What are the symptoms of dementia? \nWhile some memory loss is normal with aging, people suffering from dementia often have serious impairment from at least two of the symptoms listed below, according to the Alzheimer's Association: Memory Ability to focus and pay attention Reasoning and judgment Visual perception What are the risk factors for dementia? \nAge greatly increases the risk of dementia, especially for those over 65, according to Mayo Clinic. Like Cassidy, family history of dementia also puts people at greater risk of developing the disease. \nAccording to Oh, there are some things that people can do to lessen some risks of dementia. She said studies have shown that living a healthy lifestyle and avoiding heavy alcohol use, smoking and paying attention to cardiovascular risks like diabetes may help. \n\"Tree factors: exercise, diet and controlling cardiovascular risk factors are probably the most important things people can do to prevent dementia,\" she said. \nA recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that dementia rates in people over age 65 fell from 11.6% in 2000 to 8.8% in 2012, a decline of 24%. The drop in Dementia rates may stem from Americans' rising education levels and more emphasis on heart health and fitness, according to the study. How do doctors diagnose dementia? \nThere is no one test to diagnose dementia, but Oh said 80% of the information she uses to make a diagnosis comes from seeing a patient in person and doing a physical examination and learning about the persons history. She said doctors also use MRI and CAT scans of the brain along with blood work to make a diagnosis. \nContributing: Maria Puente, USA TODAY Network 22 CONNECT 8 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lr9PHP NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
