The two actually broke up for 5 years after dating in college, according to Daily Entertainment News . Bryan was born in 1976 and since Boyer was three years behind him in school, she's probably about 35 years old. Boyer was actually the one to make the first move on Bryan who was a senior while she was a freshman in the Alpha Delta Pi sorority. Boyer told People : He was always a gentleman. We hung out as friends first and he never made a move on me. I kissed him first! He was always so scared of making a girl feel uncomfortable, he wouldn’t cross a line ... In college, we used to go dancing in a club til 4 a.m., and he’s just as silly at home as he is on stage. He walks around dancing all day, just being goofy. He said he was captured by her blue eyes and he really tries to dedicate all his time to her when he's at home. They have two sons together - Bo and Tate, who they let watch TV in bed with them at night. Their Secrets To Marital Bliss As far as how the two keep things romantic, Bryan tells Good Housekeeping : We have coffee in the morning, just Caroline and me. It's my favorite time of the day; anytime we can have 30 minutes to talk, it's just great. We do little nights out together. One Valentine's Day, we got each other's initials tattooed on our ring fingers! Every night before bed, I rub my wife's feet. She says they're the best foot rubs on Earth. Bryan also says that when they argue, they talk things out rather than have big blow-up fights. In addition, Bryan has opted not to be flirting with models in his music videos and substituted his wife, who plays his love interest in the \"Crash My Party\" video. Bryan isn't the only one putting his marriage first, though. Boyer has actually gotten her hubby's initials tattooed on her ring finger to prove her commitment to him. Boyer's Focus Is Family Boyer may walk the red carpet with her husband and appear in his videos, but entertainment is not her focus. She revealed to Taste Of Country : I have no aspirations for anything else in the industry. My main focus are my kids and seeing Luke as much as possible. Also, I really have no talent anyway ... With three boys in my house, I’m constantly on-the-go and cleaning…Luke being the messiest one. Bryan chimed in to add: Caroline busts her butt to be the perfect wife, lets me have this career and lets me shake my a– on stage every night.
