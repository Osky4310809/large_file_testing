Sprewell was seen yelling at Dolan in 2003 during his first game back at the Garden following his trade to the Timberwolves. \nDolan surrounded himself with a number of famous Knicks on Sunday. Hall of Famer Bernard King sat to his left with Sprewell was seated to Dolan’s right. Former forward Larry Johnson sat next to Sprewell, who helped the Knicks to the 1999 NBA Finals. \n“I can’t tell you why I haven’t been back here, but I’ll tell you when I left, I was not happy,” Sprewell said to ABC, via ESPN . “New York is like a second home for me. I love the fans here. The fans have embraced me. There’s no place like the Garden to play in. I mean, who wouldn’t want to play in the Garden?” \nBut not everyone was showing support for Dolan, who banned Oakley indefinitely from the Garden after his incident with MSG security last week. Spike Lee was seen in his familiar courtside seat wearing an Oakley jersey. \nSprewell said the Oakley situation was “disappointing” and “unfortunate” and added that the two sides should “iron it out and get past it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:15:04.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
