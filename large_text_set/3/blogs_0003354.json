(Youtube/Coca-Cola) \nCoca-Cola’s latest ad titled ‘Pool Boy’– a hilarious minute-long commercial is doing round on the Internet. The ad showcases an entire modern family having a crush on the ‘Pool Boy’ comes as part of the company’s Taste the Feeling campaign. The video showed a mad race between two siblings in their bid to offer the household pool boy a bottle of Coke and quench his thirst, but in the end Mom always knows better! The siblings were been beaten by their own mother as she not only got to the pool boy before them both, but she also fixed a sandwich for the guy with the beverage. \nThe commercial has a refreshingly inclusive take on modern family life besides having undertones of pro-equality with a nod to the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer) community and promote diversity. Elevator is designed to bridge the class divide. \nAll advertisements under the campaign ‘Taste the Feeling’ are designed to translate globally with simple stories which are based on universal themes and with little to no dialogue. Different versions often are shot for different regions of the world, changing only the casting for North America-Europe, Africa and Asia. \nYou May Also Like To Watch This: \nThough this isn’t the first time that Coke has work on such issue but earlier too the beverage-giant had launched commercial titled ‘America the Beautiful’ featuring a diverse cast of Americans and several languages, which underlined the fact that America’s differences are what makes the country so beautiful.
