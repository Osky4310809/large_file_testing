Or hired a ‘friend of a friend’ to cater a party? Or purchased a late-night snack from an impromptu grill set up outside of a music venue?For many consumers, the ‘informal food economy’ is convenient, ubiquitous, and tasty. But it's actually illegal in California. You may have signed the Care2 petition defending Mariza Ruelas, a California mother who was facing jail time after a “sting operation” caught her earning extra income through a Facebook foodsharing group. That's right: a single mother of six nearly went to jail just for selling some homemade food. But a new bill could change that. Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia (Coachella) has introduced a new bill  to legalize the small-scale sale of homemade food. It would also ensure food safety practices by requiring home cooks to comply with food handling rules. Please sign this petition to urge California legislators to pass AB626 to legalize sales of homemade food! The bill is a result of a partnership with Josephine, a site that allows you to order delicious home cooked meals online and pick them up directly from loving cooks near you. This bill would benefit single mothers, underrepresented minorities, and recent immigrants who rely on cooking to support their families. For example, Josephine cooks are 85% women, 35% recent immigrants, and 45% people of color — with 40% having a household income under $45K. Please sign now to send a letter to your representatives: vote YES on AB626! read petition letter ▾ For many consumers, the ‘informal food economy’ is convenient, ubiquitous, and tasty.
