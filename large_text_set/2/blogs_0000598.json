King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 7 hours ago 6 \nIn a peculiar new interview, Mastodon guitarist Brent Hinds said the band will release another new album called \"Cold Dark Place\" on this year's Record Store Day, which would be April 22. \nAsked about the initial reports on the new Mastodon album being a double record, Brent replied: \n\"You know I gotta take the garbage out, it's a lot of garbage? I gotta take the garbage out a lot, I gotta lotta garbage. Therefore I have way too many albums sitting around basically. \n\"I've been marinating on some of it for years, they get, 'I don't know if I even like this,' you know? 'I know I can do better than this.' And then all of a sudden a friend of mine wants to listen to it, and I listen to it and it's fuckin' amazing! We should put this out!\" \nFocusing on the mysterious new album, Hinds continued: \"So that's what's gonna happen in June on Record Store Day, we're gonna put out an album I wrote entirely by myself called... \"Cold Dark Place,\" which is basically myself, I'm a cold dark place. \n\"I need it, I just want fire, I need fire.\" \nAsked about the concept of \"Cold Dark Place,\" the guitarist replied: \"'Cold Dark Place' is the concept of living and how much it hurts to fuckin' be alive.\" \nYou might remember that Mastodon had plans to release a \"winter EP\" back in the winter of 2014, but it never happened because that material turned into something more. Drummer Brann Dailor explained: \"We were gonna do this winter EP thing, but that material's kind of morphed into more than just that, so I think it'll warrant a full album release.\"Anyhow, you can watch the full interview with Brent below, you won't regret it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:28:57.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
