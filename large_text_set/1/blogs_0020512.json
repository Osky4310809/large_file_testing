Image caption Pupils at Kinross High School helped record and produce the backing track for the song \nMr Blyth told BBC Scotland: \"I posted an acoustic demo on YouTube after being rejected by the UK and suddenly I was inundated with emails and YouTube comments from Romanian Eurovision fans who really liked the song. \n\"It was one of Teodora's fans who was instrumental in putting me in touch with her. To my amazement, she had already heard my demo. She said that she loved the song and it would be a privilege to sing it in the Romanian national selections. \n\"However, she wanted a \"pop rock\" twist and that was where my pupils came in.\" \nMr Blyth, who has been in the music department at Kinross for a year, said he played it to some of his pupils, asking for their input. \nHe added: \"We recorded the new backing track at the school and my music tech pupils helped with the production.\" 'Catchy hook' \nThe 32-year-old said he wrote the song about a friend who was told when he was a teenager that he was going to lose his sight. Stephen Campbell went on to represent Ireland as a paralympian swimmer at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. \n\"I feel the subject of the song is something that hasn't really been covered by Eurovision artists. It also has a catchy hook and a live rock drive that is seldom aired in Eurovision competitions.\" \nRomania was expelled from the 2016 Eurovision contest after its national broadcaster failed to pay outstanding debts. \nBut the competition to select their entry for this year's final in Kiev in the Ukraine is already under way. \nTeodora Dinu is due to perform Tear Up The Dark for a judging panel and audience on Romanian television this weekend. \nOn Friday, a clip of Mr Blyth's original recording of the song will also be broadcast on the BBC's Eurovision: You Decide programme as part of a montage of audition tapes rejected by the UK. \nAll six of this year's UK Eurovision hopefuls are former X Factor contestants. \nHe added: \"There is a massive buzz in the school about our song. I feel that the students have been on the same journey as I have as they have known about this song during its infancy. \n\"The whole point of me promoting the original rejected demo on YouTube was to hopefully inspire the pupils to not give up when they are told 'no'.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:34:23.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
