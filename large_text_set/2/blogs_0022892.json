She’s riding 50-to-1 odds from bookmaker Ladbrokes , alongside Tom Hardy ( Taboo ) and Mathew Baynton ( You, Me, and the Apocalypse ); British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn brings up the rear at 250-to-1.\nGaiman is clearly vying for a female Doctor: His shortlist also includes geek icon Gillian Anderson ( The X-Files ) and Oscar-winner Helen Mirren ( The Queen ).\nFresh off The X-Files reboot and a three-year turn as Stella Gibson on The Fall , “bi-accented” Anderson can slip between an English and American accent as easily as the flick of a sonic screwdriver. Her next TV project is Gaiman’s own small-screen adaptation of his tome “American Gods,” set for release via Amazon Video later this year.\n“I don’t think there’s anything Gillian can’t do,” Gaiman said of the actor, adding that “if we have to go for an older Doctor it would be Helen Mirren,” aged 71.\nBudweiser\nBut, like Tilda Swinton—Ladbrokes’ odds-on favorite to become the next Time Lord—A-lister Mirren would have to take time out of a busy schedule (she’s currently filming The Nutcracker and the Four Realms ) and, more than likely, a pay cut, to step into the titular role. So don’t get your hopes up.\nAnderson and Perkins, meanwhile, are much more plausible picks to step into the TARDIS this Christmas, when Capaldi’s Twelfth Doctor is next scheduled to regenerate.\nThe last for its star and showrunner, Doctor Who ‘s 10th season hits the BBC and BBC America on April 15.", "external_links": ["https://sports.ladbrokes.com/en-gb/betting/tv-and-specials/doctor-who/next-doctor-who/223249169", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04sz9h2", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1898069", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1721226"], "published": "2017-02-23T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:58:06.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
