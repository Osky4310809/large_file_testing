The custom speedometer is based on an Arduino Nano , and wheel revolutions are measured by a magnetic and Hall effect sensor. \nThis may seem like a silly project, but if you need to take a very short glance at something, analog gauges tend to be much easier to read than digital. Perhaps this concept could be quite useful! You can see exactly how to make this hack on Instructables and in his video here with a few action shots .
