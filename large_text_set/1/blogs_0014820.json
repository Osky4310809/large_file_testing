You can see that inventory comparison — with interactive panoramas, it’s almost like you’re sitting there.” \nKelley told me that the Panos are created by using a spherical DSLR camera and a robotic tripod to take hundreds of photos around the stadium, which are then stitched together to create a 3D model of the venue. \nHe emphasized that the Pano feature isn’t replacing SeatGeek’s 2D stadium maps. He said that over time, it could also incorporate other media like YouTube or Instagram videos to convey what the stadium is like when it’s filled with cheering fans. \nSeatGeek has already created its first model — Children’s Mercy Park, the home of Sporting Kansas City.
