It's an area that seems to confuse whales and has been the site of previous mass strandings . \nConservation workers and volunteers were hoping to refloat at least some of the surviving whales at high tide Friday. If that fails, they were planning a second attempt Saturday.

The Department of Conservation put the number of dead whales at about 250 to 300. \nDepartment spokesman Andrew Lamason told Radio New Zealand they were putting sheets and buckets of water on the surviving whales and trying to keep them calm. \nHe said that with so many whales already dead, it was likely that many of the survivors would not be in good shape. \nAuthorities were asking for fit and competent volunteers to travel to the beach and help with the rescue efforts.

In 1985 about 450 whales stranded in Auckland. \nThere are different theories as to why whales strand themselves, from them chasing prey too far inshore to them trying to protect a sick member of the group. \nFarewell Spit is sometimes described as a whale trap. It has a long protruding coastline and gently sloping beaches which appears to make it difficult for whales to navigate away from with their sonar systems once they get close.
