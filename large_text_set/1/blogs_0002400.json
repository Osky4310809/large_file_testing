From Lady Gaga and Selena to Barbie and the Disney Villains, MAC is sort of the big league when it comes to collaborations. Who better to represent and inspire us than these fierce women? It is 2017, and lipstick is the new warpaint. One of our champion women to inspire us in the beauty world is Caitlyn Jenner , the powerfully brave athlete-turned-reality star-turned activist .\nJenner had a previous collaboration with the MAC beauty empire , and this week, will be releasing a second collection. The new collection is comprised of eyeshadows, a kohl liner, lipsticks, a liner, and glosses, as well as a blush and bronzer. We can pretty much look forward to an entire face of MAC makeup magic from this collection’s products alone. With classy gold and black packaging, this collection is timelessly glamorous.\nMAC Cosmetics The Caitlyn Jenner Collection will be available this Thursday, January 5th, online at maccosmetics.com and in select stores. @CaitlynJenner’s new collection continues her mission of sharing her transition with the world and championing All Ages, All Races and All Sexes. Elegant, classic shades for lips, eyes and cheeks are beautifully suited for everyone who wears them. Available online and in stores Thursday, in select markets. #MACCaitlynJenner \nA photo posted by M·A·C Cosmetics (@maccosmetics) on Jan 3, 2017 at 11:06am PST \nHere’s what you can expect with the new collection. For your cheeks MAC Cosmetics The cheek products in the collection feature a shimmery mineral finish. “Compassion” is a cool brown bronzer that is surprisingly sheer and will be available for $33. A powder blush duo in “Buddy” (a mid-tone peach and bronze) will be available for $29.\nShe's back.

The other two shades in collection are a mid-tone beige “Rockit!” and a deep crimson “Authentic Red.” All three will retail at $17 each. For those preferring a glossy wand, Caitlyn’s Cremesheen Glass comes in three shades as well: “Beautifully Bare,” a mid-tone beige; “Kindness,” a perfect gold; and “Tolerance” a mid-tone purple. Each gloss will be $21 each. We would be nowhere if we did not have our lip-liner to keep feathering in check! The collection includes “Whirl,” a dirty rose; and “Soar,” a mid-tone pinkish brown, for $17.50 each.\n#MakeupSwatches for the #NEW #MACCaitlynJenner collection launching 5th Jan at #MACCarnaby, #MACBrighton, #MACCamden, #MAC online, plus all @theofficialselfridges and @officialbrownthomas Dublin & Dundrum.

They are great for everyday wear as well as build-able for bold eye looks. Plus, how many times have you had to trim a super long fake lash strip?! The set is available for $17. The trio of shadows are available for $16 and come in “Worthy,” a rich velvety plum; “Malibu Bronze,” an ash brown with bronze; and “Glowing Gold,” a metallic gold.

Fans loved the cause and the color!\nI'm SO proud of the difference my lipstick made for @MACCosmetics Transgender Initiative! All $1.3 million is going towards #trans organizations around the United States like @glaad, @LGBTcenternyc, and @lalgbtcenter to enhance access to healthcare, economic empowerment and civil rights. I am so honored to give back to my community.
