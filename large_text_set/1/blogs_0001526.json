The game was so lopsided, in fact, that odd for the College Football National Championship game came out before the Fiesta Bowl even ended. And, surprise surprise, Alabama is the early favorite over Clemson. \nAlabama opens as 7-point favorite vs. Clemson according to @LVSuperBook \n— Brett McMurphy (@McMurphyESPN) January 1, 2017 Bama took care of business and beat the Washington Huskies 24-7 earlier on Saturday in the Peach Bowl. Yes, Alabama has been incredibly dominant literally all season long, but this number is just a tiny bit surprising given the result of the Fiesta Bowl. Ohio State entered Saturday’s as a three-point favorite over Clemson, and the Tigers ended up winning by 31 points. \nLast year, Clemson hung tough with Alabama in the CFP National Championship Game, losing 45-40.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T05:34:15.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
