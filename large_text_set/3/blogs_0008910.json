On this fateful day, he just came for nothing because according to him, he had no money. \n“But Onyinye still offered him free sex service. The man started the enjoyment but could not finish as he suddenly started shaking and jerking, and eventually died on top of the harlot.” \nHe explained that the brothel manage¬ment held the prostitute to explain what hap¬pened as she was accused of using charms on the unfortunate Lambart. They quickly called the Divisional Police Officer, Anara, who came with a team of police officers and Ony¬inyechi and detained her in their outpost cell. They later removed the corpse and deposited it at St. Kizito Mortuary, Ama¬raku in Isiala Mbano LGA of Imo State. \nOur correspondent learnt that Osigwe hailed from Umuezeala-Ama in the Ehime Mbano Local Government Area of the state and had his dreaded shrine situated in his ancestral home, where people trooped in to consult him for mystical solutions . \nIt was discovered that the death of the man had sent shock wave into the spines of the people doing business within and around the area and out of fear, all the commercial sex workers had fled the area. \nOur correspondent learnt also that the deceased’s major customers were Internet fraudsters, popularly known as ‘yahoo yahoo’ boys, who reportedly used his charms to get at their targets. \nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Andrew Enwerem, said that he had yet to be briefed. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T05:10:18.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
