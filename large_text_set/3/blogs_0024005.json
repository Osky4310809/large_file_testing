But Will it Last? \n\"Entertainment and technology have gone together for a long time,\" says Andrea Belz, the vice dean for technology innovation and entrepreneurship at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. \"L.A. is a great place to do that. There's a lot of talent here to support it.\" \nRandy Saaf, CEO of L.A.-based VR gaming company Lucid Sight , says the virtual reality medium is ripe for shared workspaces because the cost of computers and headsets for VR work is prohibitive. \"VR can be kind of a high-cost endeavor for a startup,\" he says. \"Shared workspace is a good way for a small shop to get up and running quickly.\" \nThe 2015 Startup Ecosystem global rankings from startup research firm Compass put L.A. in third place behind No. 1 Silicon Valley and No. 2 New York. It's not like L.A.-based Snapchat and its big-money debut on the stock market — or Upload LA's launch — will change that overnight. But their presence is likely to attract even more investment. \n\"Investors from other parts of the country go to Silicon Valley because they can access a much deeper talent pool,\" USC's Belz says. \"That same pool exists here in L.A. Talent here tends to give investors a lot of options.\" \nVirtual reality, for example, can include film, gaming, advertising and even therapeutic treatment. For instance, post-traumatic stress disorder might be treated with \"immersive experiences that put you in a different environment,\" Belz says.
