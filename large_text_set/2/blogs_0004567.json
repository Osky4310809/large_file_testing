(credit: CBS2) \nNEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A sea of demonstrators packed Christopher Street outside the Stonewall Inn Saturday to push back against President Donald Trump’s executive order banning refugees and immigrants entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \nOrganizers say it was a show of solidarity with Muslim, Latino, refugee, and immigrant communities at the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement. Senate Majority Leader and New York lawmaker Chuck Schumer led the crowd in a series of “Dump Trump” chants.\nOn Friday, a federal judge in Washington State put a nationwide hold on the president’s executive order denying entry to the U.S. to refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The ruling set in motion another weekend of confusion and chaos around the country. \"She can take her conversion therapy back to Michigan and bury it,\" @SenSchumer says of @BetsyDeVos at #stonewall rally. pic.twitter.com/0rH76K7PCk \n— Myles Miller (@MylesMill) February 4, 2017 \nThe executive order was signed eight days ago and has been met with nationwide protests every day since.
