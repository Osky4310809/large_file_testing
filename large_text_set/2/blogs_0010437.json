Well, now Volvo has released pricing for the wagon, and guess what? The V90 R-Design is the least expensive version. \n-The V90 R-Design starts at $50,945, and the V90 Inscription is $52,945. Those prices are for vehicles equipped with the T5 powertrain, which consists of Volvo’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, driving the front wheels.\n- \n-The Cross Country, which doesn’t offer multiple trim levels, starts at $56,295—but that’s with the T6 powertrain (there is no T5 Cross Country). If you want the T6 supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter four (good for 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft) and all-wheel drive on your regular V90, that’s $56,945 for the R-Design and $58,945 for the Inscription—so it’s a little dearer than the Cross Country.\n-All V90 wagons come standard with Volvo’s Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capability (which works at speeds up to 80 mph), adaptive cruise control, automated emergency braking (with pedestrian and large-animal detection), lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, Volvo’s Sensus 12.3-inch vertical touchscreen with navigation, and a panoramic sunroof. As befits their sporty status, the R-Design models have what’s described as a “sport” chassis, sport pedals, metal interior trim, and leather and nubuck upholstery in gray, as well as the following R-Design-specific items: grille, exterior trim, illuminated sill moldings, shift knob, steering wheel, carpet, and key fob. The Inscription gets a “dynamic” chassis, full leather (in a choice of four colors), walnut trim, multicontour seats with power-adjustable lateral support and cushion extenders, heated and ventilated front seats, a power cargo cover, and its own design for the 19-inch wheels, exterior trim, carpet, and key fob.\n- \n-Because the V90 is special order only (unlike the Cross Country, which will be stocked in dealerships), Volvo is able to offer far more than the usual level of customization. There are nearly 20 options (depending on trim level and powertrain), all of which are available individually, so you’re not forced to buy packages. A Bowers & Wilkins audio system is the priciest at $3200, but other notable items include a head-up display ($900), a 360-degree camera ($900), 20-inch wheels ($800), integrated booster seats ($500), automated park assist ($500), and a heated steering wheel ($300). Volvo’s air suspension and adaptive dampers ($1200) are reserved for T6 models only.\n- - First Drive: 2018 Volvo V90 - First Drive: 2017 Volvo V90 Cross Country - Volvo V90 Research: Reviews, Photos, Specs, Pricing, and More - -Perhaps the ability to customize one’s ride will be sufficient enticement to get buyers to wait out the process of placing a special order for a V90 rather than opting for a Cross Country that’s sitting on the dealer lot. Besides, the V90 R-Design looks so damn good.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:20:15.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
