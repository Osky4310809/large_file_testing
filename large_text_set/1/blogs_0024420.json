While no countries are specifically named in the order, it refers to a statute that would apply to seven Muslim-majority nations: Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Iraq. \nThere is an exception for certain types of visas, including for diplomats and the United Nations. The temporary halt is aimed at giving the Department of \nHomeland Security, the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence time to determine what information is needed from each country to ensure that visas are not issued to individuals posing a national security threat.

The government already has extensive databases but some believe they need to be expanded. \nThe order suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows consular officers to exempt some applicants from face-to-face interviews if they are seeking to renew their temporary visas within a year of expiration. \nImmigration attorneys say the changes will make even routine applications much more complicated and time consuming and couldmean that more people will need assistance to get through the visa process. \nIn an attempt to ensure wait times for interviews are \"not unduly affected,\" the order calls for the hiring of more consular fellows to work in U.S. embassies abroad.

It could also protect ethnic minorities like the Yazidis in the Middle East. This could potentially open the door to legal challenges claiming religious discrimination, some legal experts say. \nOnce refugee admissions resume, fewer will be allowed. The 2017 cap was set at 50,000 people, compared to 85,000 designated by President Barack Obama for 2016. \nIn a nod to certain states and cities that have objected to refugee resettlement, the order also seeks to give state andlocal jurisdictions a role in deciding whether or not to allow people to live there. Completing the \"Biometric entry-exit tracking system\" \nThe system is aimed at tracking foreign visitors' arrival and departure using information like finger prints. FormerPresident Barack Obama's administration had aimed to start implementing biometric exit checks at the country's largestairports by 2018. \nSome experts have said that for the system to work properly, it would need to cover all land, air, and sea ports of entry, which is a major undertaking. \nAccording to a 2014 report from the Bipartisan Policy Center the system would be expensive to implement and would \"offer mixed value for enforcement objectives.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T20:42:56.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
