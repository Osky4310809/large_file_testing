(Photo via CW) Stay on target Meet the Newest Member of the Archie Family: Reggie Comics to bewitch your senses When The CW first started talking about Riverdale , it was easy to be skeptical. A dark, modern adaptation of Archie comics? Really? Yes, the network has a fantastic track record with comic book shows, but Archie isn’t a superhero. He’s a normal teenage boy. Would Riverdale turn into just another teen soap opera? Well, thanks to a unique look, an intriguing mystery, and well-written characters, it became a lot more.\nRight away, Riverdale lets you know exactly what kind of show this is going to be. A noir-style narrator, who we learn to be Jughead, tells us that if you look closely at the idyllic small town, you’ll see the shadows. Here, Jughead sets up what will most likely be the main mystery of the first season. Cheryl Blossom’s brother Jason mysteriously died while the twins were on a boat in the river early Fourth of July morning. Cheryl says he fell into the water trying to rescue her glove and drowned. The police can’t find a body and accept her story.\nThe Twin Peaks influence is heavy on this opening scene. The haunting music, the breathless way the Blossom twins speak to each other, the unsettling camera angles, all of it immediately makes Riverdale feel like Archie Meets David Lynch. The show jumps forward to the night before the first day of school, and it starts to feel more like a typical teenage soap. Archie has returned from a summer of working construction and is meeting up with Betty at Pop’s Chock’lit Shop. Betty’s friend Kevin is helping her pick an outfit and encouraging her to tell Archie she likes him. His arguments grow more emphatic when they spy a shirtless Archie through his bedroom window. He got buff over the summer.\nKJ Apa as Archie, Camila Mendes as Veronica and Lili Reinhart as Betty. (Photo: Katie Yu/The CW)\nThe would-be date doesn’t go exactly the way Betty plans, though. Just as she’s about to confess her feelings to Archie, a new girl walks in. It’s Veronica, who used to be a rich girl in New York, but her family recently lost everything, and she was forced to move back to her mom’s small hometown. Archie immediately tunes out Betty and starts drooling over Veronica. Yeah, he can be kind of an ass.\nVeronica’s character turned out to be one of the better surprises of the show. It would have been easy to cast her as the snobby rich girl. As the episode goes on, it becomes clear that that was who she used to be. Her recent experiences have humbled her, and she is a genuinely nice person. Instead of a bitter rival, she instantly becomes one of Betty’s best friends and strongest supporters. She encourages Betty to go after Archie despite her own feelings for him. She forces Cheryl Blossom, who actually is Riverdale’s resident stuck up rich girl, to accept Betty onto the cheerleading team. It was an unexpected and refreshing take on the character.\nArchie himself turns out to have a pretty conflicted life. His dad wants him to work construction and eventually take over his business. His coach wants him to play varsity football. He just wants to make music. While working construction, he wrote lyrics in his head and recorded some songs despite having no musical training. Everyone he plays them for agrees that he’s some kind of musical genius, but could really use some training. He asks Josie and the Pussycats, but they’re too busy developing their brand. We do get to hear one of their songs briefly, and I can’t wait to hear more. Their story will likely be one of the most fun to follow. (And who knows? Maybe they’ll get a spin-off show. The Archie-verse starts here.) At any rate, their song is better than what Archie has been playing for people.\nAshleigh Murray as Josie (Photo: Katie Yu/The CW)\nAs Archie approaches Miss Grundy, the music teacher for lessons, we learn that they have an awkward (and illegal) past. During the summer, she saw Archie walking down the street while driving and couldn’t stop staring at his abs. She offered him a ride home and, well, you can guess where this is going. Now, she wants no contact with Archie, but she’s the only one who can teach him music. Then we learn he wants to talk about something else. They were together near the river on the morning of July Fourth, when Jason Blossom supposedly drowned. They heard a gunshot. But, fearing having to explain why they were together so early in the morning, they had to keep it a secret. After promising that music is all he’s interested in, Miss Grundy agrees to tutor Archie.\nThe rest of the episode carries on in typical teen soap fashion. There’s a dance followed by an afterparty where Archie and Veronica are made to spend seven minutes in a closet, much to Betty’s dismay. Archie runs to her house and tells her that she’s “perfect,” but he doesn’t have romantic feelings for her. She storms into her house, and Archie runs to Pop’s where he runs into Jughead. They used to be friends, but aren’t any more for some reason. That’s all we get because the teen soap is interrupted by the mystery portion of the show. Jason Blossom’s body has turned up in the river. He has a gunshot wound in his head.\nCole Sprouse as Jughead (Photo: Katie Yu/The CW)\nRiverdale is absolutely a teen soap opera, but it’s one of the most enjoyable ones I’ve ever seen. The characters are interesting and complex to the point where I want to see where the season takes them. The Betty/Veronica friendship is one of the show’s best elements. Lili Reinhart (Betty) and Camila Mendes (Veronica) have a natural chemistry together, which makes you root for them more than anyone else. Like in the comics, Archie is the least interesting character in his own show, which is why I hope we see more of the ensemble as the season goes on. The mystery is intriguing, but Riverdale has enough unrelated secrets to keep things interesting even while we try to figure out whodunit. If this show takes off, I’m on board for an expanded Archie-verse. While crossing it over with Greg Berlanti’s other CW shows might be too much, here’s hoping they can make a deal with Marvel and get us a live action Archie Meets The Punisher .\nI love the art direction and cinematography of Riverdale. The lighting is sparse, which makes the bright colors, like the Pop’s neon sign or Archie’s hair, stand out. It has the effect of making every frame look like a comic panel. Hell, the show looks more like a comic book than any of The CW’s superhero fare. The framing, editing and subtle music helps give the show a Lynchian feel. Yes, this show is borrowing heavily from Twin Peaks , but by combining that with a compelling teen soap story and its own weirdness, Riverdale turns into something all its own. Besides, there are certainly worse shows it could emulate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T07:20:46.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
