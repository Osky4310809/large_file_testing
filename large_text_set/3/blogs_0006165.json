She also trains other instructors to teach Pilates, and the host of other fitness regimes that Yasmin is certified in. According to her, \"Women need to realise that our ancestors' lives were far more active than our sedentary ones, with drivers, maids, and nannies at our beck and call. Women need to start strength training, and not just stick to cardio.\" Indeed, Yasmin Karachiwala is not just another person in the fitness industry who is only regurgitating tried and tested methods. She has a keen understanding of the needs of the country's women, and caters to that in the best way possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:05:19.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
