That leaves it down 11% in the demo and 7% in total viewers from last year, which were 10-year highs. It’s also lower than 2013 (6.4 in the demo, 19.7 million) but out-rates all shows from 2008 through 2012. \nIn same-night viewing, the Globes are the top-rated primetime entertainment series in 18-49 and total viewers on any network since ABC’s telecast of the Academy Awards last March (13.1 in 18-49, 43.6 million viewers overall). \n\nAfter soaring to its largest audience in a decade last year, the Golden Globes on NBC cooled off a bit in the ratings this time around. \nNielsen was expected to release total-viewer and demo estimates for Sunday’s primetime telecast later Monday, but in the overnights the show earned a 12.6 household rating/19 share — down 11% from last year’s 14.1 and about on par with 2013. Still, the 12.6 is higher than every year from 2008 through 2012, the five-year span prior to the first year Tina Fey and Amy Poehler served as co-hosts. \nLast year’s ceremony on NBC averaged 20.87 million viewers in total (a 10-year high) and a 6.5 rating/16 share in adults 18-49 (a seven-year high). \nDespite the falloff, the “Golden Globe Awards” telecast is unlikely to lose its status as the year’s third most popular kudocast, as it has typically finished behind only the Academy Awards on ABC and the Grammy Awards on CBS in both adults 18-49 and total viewers. \nIt’s hard to pinpoint a single reason for the decline. Perhaps it’s the niche nature of the programs and films that won on Sunday (think “Transparent,”“Grand Budapest Hotel” and “Fargo”) made it hard for auds to have much of a rooting interest. \nThe Globes did get an assist from the NFL, as Sunday’s late afternoon playoff game between the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos ended on CBS at around 7:45 p.m. ET, giving its 40 million-plus viewers a chance to flip over to NBC in time. \nIn social media, Facebook reported that the Golden Globes generated over 17 million interactions (posts, comments, likes) from about 8 million people. The three biggest moments were Prince presenting for best original song (Common & John Legend won), Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson presenting best supporting actress (Joanne Frogatt won), and “Transparent” winning for best comedy or musical. \nAnd there was a total of 2.6 million tweets regarding the Golden Globes during the show’s live broadcast last night, according to Nielsen, an increase of 24% vs. the prior year’s 2.1 million tweets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T17:55:08.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
