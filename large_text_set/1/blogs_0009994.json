Beginning the Work With Color A \nI've worked a couple rows of single crochet in baby pink yarn, which we'll call color A. I'm going to change colors to begin the next row with baby blue, which we'll call color B. \nTo begin the process of changing colors, work as far as the last single crochet stitch in the row, but leave the last single crochet stitch unfinished as shown. \ncontinue reading below our video How to Crochet: Switching Colors Grab the New Color of Yarn With Your Crochet Hook.

Completing the Color Change \nPull up a loop with color B. \nYou might have to tug gently on the yarn end of color A to keep the color A loops from getting too big. To Cut, or Not to Cut \nIf you plan to use color A again within the next few rows, don't cut the yarn; leave it attached so that you can carry it up the sides and avoid having to weave in ends . Cutting the Yarn and Weaving in the Ends \nIf you don't plan to use color A again within the next few rows, cut color A, leaving a long tail of yarn - at least six inches or so. You will have to weave this end in later. Cutting the Yarn and Crocheting Over the Ends \nAlternatively, in some cases, you may be able to work overtop of the end. \nThis is not as secure a method as weaving in the ends, particularly not if you crochet loosely or if you are working in a lacy stitch pattern. The main advantage is that it's quicker than weaving in ends. Use this method for projects that won't be laundered frequently - for example, doll clothes. This technique works best if there is not a lot of contrast between your colors. Work the Turning Chain in the New Color. Photo © Amy Solovay, Licensed to About.com, Inc.
