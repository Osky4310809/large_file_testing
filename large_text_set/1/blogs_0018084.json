Sonam Kapoor channelled her inner fall tree (literally decked in autumn flora) in a Ralph and Rusoo gown + overcoat combo, while on one of her endorsement-related tours.

This time, by Deepika Padukone for one of her many premiers of XXX: The Movie . A photo posted by Shaleena (@shaleenanathani) on Jan 19, 2017 at 8:22pm PST \n3.

Karisma Kapoor stuck to her guns and picked a monochrome AM:PM outfit - a white dhoti and a black jacket - that had all the qualities of a wedding-ready ensemble. A photo posted by KK (@therealkarismakapoor) on Jan 16, 2017 at 3:20am PST \n7. Jacqueline Fernandez posed as the most stylish person at the airport, in a military jacket and a nude pair of heels. A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Jan 18, 2017 at 10:27am PST \n8. Vaani Kapoor made a fresh case for metallic suits in a benarasi Payal Khandwala number. Let's just say this is best-suited (geddit) for when you need to make a cool-girl statement.
