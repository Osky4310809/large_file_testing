The Switch comes with just 32 Gigabytes of internal memory, a portion of which is set aside for system use. On today's Treehouse livestream , however, Nintendo revealed that the Switch can support up to 256 Gigabyte Micro SDXC cards. The card slips seamlessly into a slot underneath the system's kickstand, shown below. \nSamsung-brand 256GB Micro SDXC cards currently run between $150-200 on Amazon, so getting the maximum amount of space will significantly increase your investment in the Switch. However, don't go shopping quite yet; the Switch's internal space may not be as big of a concern as it is on the PS4 and Xbox One, which require you install all game data onto their respective hard drives. We'll have to wait and see how the Switch handles game data as well as updates and DLC before deciding what kind of space we'll need.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:17:34.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
