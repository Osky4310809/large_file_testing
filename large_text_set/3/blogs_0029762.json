Six seasons in, we've come to perversely root for the nefarious, yellow-haired leaders, but the actor playing Jaime hints that all is not well for the Lannister lovers when Game of Thrones returns this summer.\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast about his upcoming film Small Crimes , Nikolaj Coster-Waldau revealed that Jamie may not be the only one vying for his sister's affections in Season 7 of Game of Thrones .\nSEE ALSO: 10 burning questions we need answered in 'Game of Thrones' Season 7\n\"[Jaime] knows about people’s weaknesses and loving someone unconditionally — because he loves his sister unconditionally,\" Coster-Waldau said in the interview. \"Plus, there are no other suitors. Well, that’s not true…\"\n\"Wow, I was about to reveal something from Season 7 and thought, 'What am I doing?'\" he added quickly.\nBuzzfeed noted that fans have speculated about Cersei ending up with Euron Greyjoy, who — if you don't remember the finer points — basically sucks.\nDoes this mean Jaime \"Fuck everyone who isn't us\" Lannister is going to be demoted from the Iron Throne of incest? Who even are Jaime and Cersei if they're not twins in highly illicit love?\n\"It is very complex, and the more you dig into it, the more complex it gets,\" Coster-Waldau told The Daily Beast . \"We’re so deep into this story and getting into the endgame now so for all of us who have been on the whole journey, you really want to get it right. Every scene and every moment feels ridiculously important.\"\nHe also described the interviewer's theory that Jamie is going to kill Cersei as \"great\" with a nod to Badass Brienne of Tarth, who loves the Kinslayer dearly.\n\"[Jaime and Brienne's relationship is] built out of contempt, which has turned into real respect, and love—not that they would ever use that word,\" Coster-Waldau said. \"I think they feel very strongly for each other. I have no idea if they would ever be able to act on it, and I don’t think they would. It’s all been about Cersei his whole life.\"\nGame of Thrones returns for Season 7 on July 16.\nWATCH: Ed Sheeran is set to make a tour stop in Westeros", "external_links": ["http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/24/nikolaj-coster-waldau-on-game-of-thrones-that-cersei-look-and-his-darkest-role-yet.html", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/vfxUCrEN.m3u8", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/crystalro/jaime-lannister-almost-spoiled-a-major-game-of-thrones-plot?utm_term=.ih4kNopRB#.tevaAZ78e", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/vfxUCrEN.jpg", "http://winteriscoming.net/2016/07/07/game-of-thrones-theorycrafting-will-cersei-lannister-marry-euron-greyjoy/"], "published": "2017-03-28T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:00:32.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
