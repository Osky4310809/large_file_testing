But they needed this, and that’s why I referred to it as effective because it clearly, clearly was, and they were discombobulated by it, flabbergasted by it.” \nHe also said he thinks that the media will never be on the “same stage” as Trump because they live in a completely separate world and have “no desire” to learn anything about his voters outside of their preconceived notions. \nLimbaugh’s praise of the press conference led to President Trump tweeting this out: \"One of the most effective press conferences I've ever seen!\" says Rush Limbaugh. Many agree.Yet FAKE MEDIA calls it differently! Dishonest \n— Donald J.
