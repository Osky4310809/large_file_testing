Disney's upcoming live-action remake of Mulan will reportedly have no songs, according to the film's director.\nSEE ALSO: The 10 best Disney villain songs\n\"No songs right now, much to the horror of my children,\" director Niki Caro ( Whale Rider ) told Moviefone . The same reporter spoke with Disney's President of Motion Picture Production, Sean Bailey, who pointed in the same direction.\n“ Mulan is clearly an empowered-female story but we can also do something new in this reimagining, make it a little more muscular, stronger, with touch of Ridley Scott,” Bailey told Vulture .\nCaro also used the word \"muscular\" as well as \"thrilling\" and \"entertaining.\" Their take on Mulan is less musical Disney and more epic action movie, based in Chinese legend. It makes sense that songs about who you are inside and what type of girl to fight for wouldn't fit into a film like that, but it feels like a betrayal to a classic soundtrack, especially after Beauty and the Beast barely strayed from its source material and opened to 170 million this past weekend.\nThe film isn't due until 2018 and is still in its early stages, so this *could* change. The project already ran into backlash in 2016, when an older, leaked script depicted a white savior (later versions course-corrected ). In the wake of Hollywood fails such as The Great Wall and Iron Fist , Mulan clearly has a lot riding on it.\nBut can't we please, please have some songs?\nWATCH: Josh Gad and Luke Evans have fun with Mashable", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mulan-script-white-male-hero_us_57fbda9de4b068ecb5e0c241", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVcLIfSC4OE?enablejsapi=1&", "https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/08/what-is-matt-damon-doing-on-top-of-the-great-wall/494090/", "https://youtu.be/FZ4zTXHqGBw?t=43", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCKJqiaD90", "https://www.moviefone.com/2017/03/17/mulan-exclusive-niki-caro/", "http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/fans-dont-want-a-mulan-with-a-white-male-lead.html", "http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-disneys-remake-machine.html", "http://a.amz.mshcdn.com/assets/lib/aab-3e4af80fa7eef43b2c82c5f3e3a386e50b041bb6ee6b415a5a69b0c863479851.js", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Jcc2CfVy.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Jcc2CfVy.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-20T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:12:11.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
