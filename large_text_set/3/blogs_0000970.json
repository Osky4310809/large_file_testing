Protestant Christians recognize 27 inspired books of the New Testament. Roman Catholic and a few Orthodox translations contain additional books, recognizing a portion of the Apocrypha . • The Apocrypha \nBoth Jews and early church fathers agreed on 39 divinely inspired books as comprising the Old Testament canon of Scripture. Augustine (400 A.D.), however, included the books of the Apocrypha. A large portion of the Apocrypha was officially recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as part of the biblical canon at the Council of Trent in A.D. 1546. Today, Coptic , Greek and Russian Orthodox churches also accept these books as divinely inspired by God. The word apocrypha means \"hidden.\" The books of the Apocrypha are not considered authoritative in Judaism and Protestant Christian churches. More » • Old Testament Books of the Bible \nThe 39 books of the Old Testament were written over a period of approximately 1,000 years, beginning with Moses (around 1450 B.C.) until the time when the Jewish people returned to Judah from exile (538-400 B.C.) during the Persian Empire . The English Bible follows the order of the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint), and thus differs in order from the Hebrew Bible. For the sake of this study, we will consider the divisions of Greek and English Bibles only. Many English Bible readers may not realize that the books are ordered and grouped according to style or type of writing, and not chronologically. More » • The Pentateuch \nWritten more than 3,000 years ago, the first five books of the Bible are called the Pentateuch. The word pentateuch means \"five vessels,\"\"five containers,\" or \"five-volumed book.\" For the most part, both Jewish and Christian tradition credit Moses with primary authorship of the Pentateuch. These five books form the theological foundation of the Bible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T18:28:30.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
