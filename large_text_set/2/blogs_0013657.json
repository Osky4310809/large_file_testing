The retailer is selling the 64 GB version of the device for $249.98, which is $100 off its list price. And that’s not even the best part. You can also get an additional $50 off by using a promo code — 0210CLS03. This means that the Axon Pro can be yours for just $199.98, but only if you opt for the Gold color option.\nIf you want to save some additional money, you’re better off getting the 32 GB version of the smartphone. It currently retails for $219.99, but it can be yours for less during the promotional period. The retailer is offering a 20 percent discount on the device which means you can get your hands on it for $175.99. Unfortunately, the company only has the Phthalo Blue color in stock. To secure the discount, use the same 0210CLS03 promo code.\nAdditionally, the retailer is throwing in a few extra goodies. You’ll get the JBL E13 in-ear headphones for free with your Axon Pro purchase, along with ZTE’s Passport 2.0 coverage, which offers a full two-year warranty, free two-way shipping, and up to a $100 discount on your next ZTE device, among others.\nSee also: ZTE Axon 7 update brings Nougat, Daydream View support, and more 1 week ago As a refresher, the ZTE Axon Pro comes with a 5.5-inch display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels.
