By Christopher Dempsey | | The Denver Post January 21, 2017 at 9:43 pm Editorial: Trump’s refreshing promise to the people \nThere are two inescapable realities about the first half of the Nuggets’ season. First, they are in a playoff race, played in by a bottom half of the Western Conference that is all struggling, to be sure. But in it nonetheless, currently occupying the eighth playoff slot. \nSecond, at 18-24 after Saturday night’s 123-98 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers at the Pepsi Center , the Nuggets know they have a long way to go to be the team they want to be. It’s just best to know that while playing for something real. \n“I hope we’re not who we are going to be for the last 41 games, because we’re not good enough,” coach Michael Malone said. “We’ve improved in certain areas, but obviously other areas we need a lot of improvement. So, hopefully as we go down into the second half of the season we can still play at a high level offensively, but find a way to get back to becoming a competitive defensive team. Even just an average defensive team. We can’t stay at a bottom-three defensive team and expect to be a playoff team.” \nThe Nuggets took a step in the right defensive direction against the Clippers, holding them to 41.7 percent shooting from the field in as effective a performance as they have had on that end all season. It helped that the Clippers were missing two of their stars, point guard Chris Paul and forward Blake Griffin, but opponents missing key players hasn’t necessarily equaled certain victories in Denver’s past.

Offensively, they have transformed into one of the most potent teams in the NBA. All that required was a change in the starting lineup, notably inserting second-year center Nikola Jokic . Since that change Dec. 15, only the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets have averaged more points, only Golden State and the San Antonio Spurs have a better field-goal percentage — and the Nuggets have a 9-8 record. \n“I think we’re good,” said Jokic, whose double-double Saturday consisted of 19 points and 10 rebounds. “I think we’re supposed to have a little bit more wins, but we’re doing good.” \nAsked whether the Nuggets are a better team than at the start of the season, Danilo Gallinari didn’t hesitate to respond. \n“Yes, we are,” Gallinari said. “Our offense is much, much better. We’ve been playing good basketball at the beginning of the season too; it’s just been not that constant. Too many ups and downs. Offense is going to be fine. We’ve just got to be focused on our defense for 48 minutes every night.” \nBOXSCORE: Clippers, 98, Nuggets 123 \nMalone seconded Gallo’s defensive remarks. \n“I know that halfway through it’s tough to make changes and all of that,” Malone said. “But, hey, after the first 25 games we made a change, found an identity and now our offense is one of the best in the NBA. So my hope is we can find a way to help our guys defensively to improve on that end as well.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T06:45:02.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
