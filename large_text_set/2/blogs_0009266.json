It was just so quick but I managed to get in there in time. \n\"After a few seconds later there was her little face looking up at me. I managed to catch her and gather her up in the towels. \n\"It all happened so quickly that we could only estimate that she was born at 8pm. \n\"I didn't get home until 3am but I couldn't sleep because of the adrenalin. \n\"I stayed up and washed a bundle of towels for them because we had used so many and then I was up before 7am. It has been quite an experience. \n\"Claire did very well and it will be something to tell Iris when she grows up. \n\"Baby Iris is flourishing, she has lots of dark hair and seems to be very content. \n\"It's a lovely bond we will have.\" Read More Pregnant woman live streaming birth on Facebook 'arrives at hospital to find there's no bed for her' Call The Midwife star Miranda Hart (Photo: BBC) \nMrs Austin had been to Cotswold Birth Centre with husband Graham earlier but because she was in the very early stages of labour she was sent home, on January 28. \nShe was putting her son to bed around 7.30pm when she felt a sharp pain and rushed to the loo - and little Iris was born ten minutes later. \nThe paramedics and midwife arrived at around 9pm. \nShe said: \"I thought I had ages to go and all of a sudden I didn't have ages to go. \n\"There was no chance of going anywhere. Luckily my mum was there. \n\"We were putting my son to bed, my contractions had been completely manageable, they were getting closer but I wasn't in any great pain. \n\"I was reading him a story and then I had a really painful contraction. I had four or five more painful contractions. I went to the loo and my waters broke. \n\"I got off the loo onto all fours. I was in the en suite so it's really small - I couldn't move. My mum grabbed a load of towels, climbed over me into the bath. Within two or three contractions she was born. \n\"I was lucky. My mum is the most squeamish person as well. She is the kind of person who would faint having her own blood taken. \n\"The fact that she held it all together and delivered her - my mum had to do everything. \n\"All my mum's experience came from Call the Midwife - and having four children of her own helps.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T17:26:35.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
