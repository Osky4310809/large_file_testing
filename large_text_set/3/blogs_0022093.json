Reuters 3 Jonas Olsson has quit West Brom to move back to Sweden \nThe 34-year-old has been one of the key players for West Brom over the past nine years which has seen them finally establish themselves as a genuine Premier League club. \nBut he has seen his starting chances limited this season by the form of Jonny Evans and Gareth McAuley, and the chance to extend his career in his native Sweden was too good to turn down. Getty Images 3 Jonas Olsson has been frustrated at spending much of this season on the bench \nOlsson said: “It’s all happened so quickly I’ve not had chance to say a proper farewell to so many people. \n“I will be back at the first chance to do that. But I’m really grateful to the club for helping me sort out this transfer. \n“I still feel I have a few good years in me but such is the quality of the competition at Albion for places in my position, it was getting harder and harder to see a first team opportunity.
