A breath test could be used as a non-invasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival Dr Sheraz Markar, one of the trial researchers from Imperial College London \nT he procedure is expensive and can be uncomfortable. Once diagnosed, around 85 per cent of sufferers die within five years. By the time symptoms appear, the disease is often in later stages. \nBut scientists believe the new tests, which measures five different chemicals in each breath, could make it simpler to screen patients earlier. \nThe chemicals give vital clues on whether someone has cancer or a less serious gastric condition. \nDr Sheraz Markar, one of the trial researchers from Imperial College London, said: \"At present the only way to diagnose oesophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy. This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications. \n\"A breath test could be used as a non-invasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival.\" \nEach year in the UK around 6,682 people are diagnosed with stomach cancer and 4,576 die from the disease. \nThere are 8,919 cases of oesophageal cancer, affecting the food pipe or gullet, with 7,790 deaths. \nFor the new study breath samples were collected from 335 patients at three London hospitals. Of these, 163 had been diagnosed with oesophageal or stomach cancer while 172 were shown to be cancer-free after undergoing endoscopy tests. Five cancer red flags to never ignore \nT he results, presented at the European Cancer Congress meeting in Amsterdam, showed that the test was both good at identifying those patients who had cancer, and unlikely to produce a false diagnosis. \nOver the next three years, the researchers plan to run a larger trial including patients not yet diagnosed with cancer. \nThe team is also working on breath tests for other types of cancer, such as those affecting the bowel and pancreas. \nDr Justine Alford from Cancer Research UK welcomed the findings. \"The next step is to see if it can detect the disease at its earliest stages,\" she said.
