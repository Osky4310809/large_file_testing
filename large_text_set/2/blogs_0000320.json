Her blonde hair was swept up in an elegant updo that we need a tutorial for ASAP.\nHer super-cute earrings, clutch bag, and shoes were also courtesy of Dior.\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Dior Beauty There’s no doubt Dianna must have turned heads during the party, which apparently lasted well into the early morning hours.\nIt was a Dior event so, of course, it was studded with celebrities we love to watch.\nBella and Anwar Hadid, Keke Palmer, and Troye Sivan are just some of the guests who stopped by to party the night away. Black seemed to be an ongoing theme in the outfits; can’t go wrong with that TBH.\nDianna, by her own admission, likes to be daring with her fashion choices.\nBig thanks to @lalignenyc for making this dress that I now can't live without. Proud of my friends Molly, Valerie and Meredith and their new line. \nA photo posted by Dianna Agron (@diannaagron) on Jun 15, 2016 at 11:46am PDT \n“Don’t think too hard, and don’t listen to the rules. I’m eclectic and quirky, and like switching from being super-feminine to dressing masculine,” the Glee actress said during a NYFW 2015 interview .\nRules are made to be broken, after all!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:10:10.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
