Old-fashioned sort of kid. \n“He tore his pec in the Nines and I remember I rung him and I said come over to the house. \n“He was really down in the dumps and he felt his career was in the balance — he hadn’t quite cracked it in first grade at that point. \n“I said we’ll go down to the park, walk around, have a bit of a talk. \n“I remember walking along just chatting away, and I looked, he wasn’t alongside me, he was about 10 yards behind. \n“I turned around and he had his head down, he had his arm in his sling and he said ‘Matty, I just want to tell you something. I’m scared I’m not going to make it’. \n“When someone says that to you, you know they’ll do anything. That hunger and desire he’s got, that fire in the belly is rare.” Luke Keary of the Roosters in action against the Rabbitohs on Thursday night. Source: Getty Images \nAs history shows, Keary fought his way back into the Rabbitohs’ top 17 that year, became the team’s starting No. 6 and helped them to their drought-breaking premiership win. \nHe was the star attention when he faced many of his old teammates and he didn’t disappoint, setting up two tries in the Roosters’ fourth straight win since he arrived at the club. \n“For a five foot nine fella, he’s taken on the line with conviction every time. He’s willing to cop the bumps,” Fox Sports ’ NRL expert Michael Ennis said. \nIt’s true there have been a few bumps in Keary’s football journey, but he’s proven he can overcome adversity, even the odd Gladiator. \nLive stream the NRL premiership on FOX SPORTS.
