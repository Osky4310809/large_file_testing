It was harsh! \nEspecially when he left and the housemates didn't even notice because they were all more interested in the new housemates! Ouch! \nI do think Big Brother dropped the ball with that twist. Like or loath him, Austin was providing a lot of storylines and evoking reaction from housemates. \nThe whole thing with him and Spencer was hilarious and actually made me like Spencer even more. \"My heart did melt a tiny bit with his shock eviction and his teary face,\" Aisleyne says (Photo: Rex Features) Austin and Angie were both booted out on Friday (Photo: Rex Features) \nI think if the housemates had known it was a vote to evict Austin would still be in the House FOR SURE! \nSo, three new housemates have entered and the house has been divided into the ‘House From Hell’ and the normal house. \nI've never watched Geordie Shore so have no clue who Chloe Ferry is. I also didn't watch the Apprentice last year so have no idea who the other bird, Jessica Cunningham , is either. \nHowever it's not hard to see that they intend to cause havoc and I'd bet money they’d have sex on TV - and that's only from seeing them in their VT's! All I can say is, watch out Jasmine! (Photo: Rex Features) \nThe only one I know of is the cleaning woman, Kim Woodburn. She seems nice. She's a big character, which is good. She's a bit cheesy and gimmicky but let's give her a chance and see how she pans out. \nI can't believe Ray J left this week. I'm still not sure what went down but I really liked him and thought he was doing great. It's such a shame. (Photo: Rex Features) Chloe Ferry, Kim Woodburn and Jessica Cunningham join Celebrity Big Brother line-up as late arrivals \nAs for Brandon Block leaving the House, well all I can say is that it’s testament to the fact that Big Brother is not for the faint hearted! Even a worldwide acclaimed, wild DJ couldn't take it! \nStacey is fast becoming one of my faves. I love the way she stood up for herself with Austin. I like her character and I knew her and my girl Nicola would make friends, which I'm so pleased about as I was worried everybody else had their chums, but Nicola didn't. \nNow she does and I couldn't be happier to share my Nic with Stacey. \nThere's an eviction on Tuesday and my money is on James C. I'm sorry, but he's just not adding anything to the House, so much so I've had to Google his name as I couldn’t remember it. \nHope you guys come and have a read on Wednesday. Have a fab weekend!
