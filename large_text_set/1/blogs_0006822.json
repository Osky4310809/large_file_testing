The AHL, on the other hand, seems to have no problems with an outdoor game taking place in bad weather, if their Outdoor Classic is any indication.\nThe Ontario Reign and Bakersfield Condors are currently taking part in an outdoor AHL game in Bakersfield, Calif. Their weather? Rain, and lots of it.\nThere is so much rain at the AHL Outdoor Classic tonight that whenever anyone shoots the puck, they also shoot a puddle of water pic.twitter.com/RJ8O72ia2w \n— Brady Trettenero (@BradyTrett) January 8, 2017 Start of the 2nd period. pic.twitter.com/VQHPzZZpK2 \n— Tom Gazzola (@TomGazzola) January 8, 2017 It’s a marvel that the AHL allowed the game to continue, considering that it must be a miserable experience for fans in the stands and a safety concern for players on the ice. The whole rink is one giant puddle, and it’s clearly affecting playing conditions.\nBut the show is continuing on. The Reign were leading the Condors 2-1 in the final stretches of the third period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T07:09:28.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
