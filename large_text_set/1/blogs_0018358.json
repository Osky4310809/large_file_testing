Getty Images 8 Andy Carroll slots home the second goal for West Ham against Middlesbrough \nWest Ham stormed into an early lead when Carroll rose highest to power a header into the top corner – only for Cristhian Stuani to level the scores after a fine move from Middlesbrough. \nBut former Newcastle star Carroll was on hand to slot home from close range just before the break, before Jonathan Calleri’s stoppage time goal sent Aitor Karanka’s side to a defeat that leaves them just two places clear of the relegation zone. FACTS, STATS, GOALS AND LOLS Jose Fonte completed his £8million move from Southampton to West Ham last night but was unavailable for this fixture. Dimitri Payet – who has been deleted from the squad’s WhatsApp group and is training with West Ham’s Under-23s– was again not part of the Hammers squad. Getty Images Andy Carroll climbs to head West Ham into an early lead at the Riverside Stadium Reuters 8 Cristhian Stuani rolls the Middlesbrough equaliser past Darren Randolph Middlesbrough’s own new signing of the week, Patrick Bamford, started on the bench, as did Rudy Gestede, who joined earlier in the window. Bamford came on after 80 minutes. Andy Carroll suffered whiplash after his scissor-kick heroics against Crystal Palace last Saturday and missed training earlier in the week. But he was fit to start here and scored a bullet header before sliding in for the Hammers’ second. Aitor Karanka sprung a surprise by moving Calum Chambers from centre-half to right-back. But he showed he is still adaptable with a lovely cross from out wide for Cristhian Stuani to make it 1-1. Getty Images Andy Carroll reacts quickest to fire home from close range to restore the lead for West Ham PA:Press Association 8 Andy Carroll wheels away in celebration after putting West Ham 2-1 up at Middlesbrough Adama Traore has been in and out of Boro’s team this season. But he started here and was impressive, showing just why Chelsea are interested in the pacey winger. BDO darts world champion and Boro fan Glen Durrant was proudly paraded on the pitch at half-time and admitted standing on the Riverside turf meant more to him than winning his title. Michail Antonio is a machine. He ran himself into the ground again here, starting up front alongside Carroll before switching to the left. Any team would love a player of his work ethic. Getty Images Adama Traore tormented the West Ham defence throughout the game \n8 West Ham suffered a blow when captain Mark Noble was forced off through injury After 70 minutes, visiting fans sang their new chant of, “F*** off Payet, Dimitri Payet, We just don’t want you anymore”. This was the Hammers’ first away league win without Payet in the side since he joined at the start of last season. They had previously drawn three and lost three on the road when the Frenchman was missing.
