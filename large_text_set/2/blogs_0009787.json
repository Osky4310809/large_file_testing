Harold Wilson at the time branded the slogan \"absolutely squalid and degrading\" (Photo: PA) \nStickers branding the slogan were still found in Smethwick months after the Tories won the seat from Labour in the poll. \nAt the time Labour's Harold Wilson, who won the election overall and became Prime Minister, branded the slogan \"absolutely squalid and degrading\". \nAccording to 1964 reports in The Times, he suggested the Tory candidate Peter Griffiths could be responsible. \nBut Mr Griffiths responded by threatening to sue Mr Wilson for libel and said: \"I have never used this phrase nor has any member of the Conservative Party in Smethwick. \n\"It is not only a lie, it is a damned lie.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:19:03.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
