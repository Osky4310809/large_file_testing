Toddler gets trapped inside toy-claw arcade machine (VIDEO)   09:35 Get short URL The child spent 10 minutes trapped in the machine. © Disasterbator / YouTube A three-year-old boy got stuck inside a toy claw machine after climbing inside the glass of the arcade game in a desperate attempt to get his hands on a prize. \nJamie Bracken-Murphy from Tipperary, Ireland, became a prize himself for ten minutes after getting trapped inside the game. \nSurprisingly, James’s father wasn’t too surprised when he turned around and found his son in the arcade machine after hearing “muffled complaints,” he told the Irish Times . \n“I wasn’t surprised at all really. He’s a very mischievous, sharp kid who’s always pushing boundaries,” he said. \nA video of James stuck in the machine shows him looking a little perplexed, but unwilling to let go of two prizes he acquired during his quest. \nThe boy spent 10 minutes in the machine before staff, with the help of an off-duty fireman, helped get him out. \n“He got to keep two dragon toys after picking them up inside. He’s not embarrassed about it or anything, he just laughed about the whole thing,” the boy’s father said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T11:58:48.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
