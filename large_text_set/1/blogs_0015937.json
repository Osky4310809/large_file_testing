Even if their ground game is average, the ariel attack has potential to be special and is only limited by the capacity of a quarterback short on range but high on accuracy.\nWith wide receivers Jeremy Maclin and Tyreek Hill, as well as dominant tight end Travis Kelce, there is much to respect and fear from the Chiefs’ attack. Quarterback Alex Smith plays within his physical limitations and is extremely good at keeping his mistakes to a minimum. Surprisingly elusive, Smith is more fleet of foot than many presume, and the Pittsburgh defense will be well challenged.\nAll that said, the Kansas City offense only once saw a running back go over 100 yards this season. The Steelers defense looks well-equipped to face them. Here are the defense’s keys to the game:\nRelated: Magic number for Steelers defense is 19 \nTake care of tight end Travis Kelce The number one receiving threat for the Chiefs is their tight end. Kelce leads the team with 85 receptions, well ahead of Hill (61) and Maclin (44), who missed four games with an injury.\nIn Week 4, the Steelers held Kelce to just 23 yards in five receptions, which led to a 43-14 victory. Considering the defense was without Ryan Shazier or Sean Davis, there is plenty of reason for confidence going into this game.\nTaking Kelce out of the game would severely alter Andy Reid’s game plan and put pressure on Smith without his security blanket.\nRelated: Martavis Bryant on getting back to the Steelers: 'I know I’m on my last chance' \nBeware Tyreek Hill’s speed With 12 touchdowns on the season, the receiver and kick returner has added a playmaking dynamic that has been lacking since Dexter McCluster.\nHill has the big-play capability that has caused Pittsburgh problems in 2016. He possess the kind of speed Pittsburgh only sees from the likes of Darrius Heyward-Bey in practice. Should the Steelers fail to keep it away from him, it could give a questionable kick cover team fits.\nKickers Chis Boswell or Jordan Berry must avoid aiming the ball to him. The secondary in particular needs to make sure it makes the tackle when he does get the reception.\nPittsburgh has plenty of speed to curtail this fast receiver, although the coaching staff needs to make sure they do not get caught in coverage with a linebacker instead of a defensive back. The Chiefs are sure to line Hill up at multiple positions in the slot and even the backfield. While Kansas City will be looking for mismatches, the Steelers cannot allow them to happen.\nRelated: Physicality and fundamentals will be key to containing Tyreek Hill \nWatch Alex Smith’s feet Pittsburgh is bringing their improved pass rush into the game. The Steelers would be wise to note the danger of the Chiefs’ quarterback when he gets flushed from the pocket.\nWhile Smith is unlikely to be confused with Michael Vick in the open field, he is a danger when he breaks containment. More agile than fast, Smith seems to have a way of making yards in the open field and has quick enough feet to avoid the pressure in the pocket.\nFor players like Shazier or Bud Dupree, it is not the sort of speed that should trouble them, but if they underestimate the un-athletic-looking veteran, Smith will make them pay with a scramble for a first down. The defensive ends must keep him contained, and the pass-rushing linebackers must be aware of his movement. Smith has the ability to keep drives alive with his feet, and the Steelers need to watch this.\nRelated: Mixed reviews on Twitter about Steelers vs. Chiefs being moved to a night game ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T01:06:10.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
