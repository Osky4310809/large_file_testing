The endless stream of leaked photos and videos hasn’t dried up and we don’t expect it to in the days leading up to the official announcement. A very short video has emerged out of China today which gives us a glimpse of what appears to be a working Galaxy S8. \nYou can see the Galaxy S8′s gorgeous display in the video and how nicely it blends with the minimal bezels that the smartphone has. The person holding the phone unlocks it by placing his finger on the fingerprint sensor that’s located at the back alongside the rear camera. He then flips it over to give us a look at the other side. \nThis is far from a proper walkthrough of Samsung’s new flagship smartphone but it does reiterate almost everything that we’ve heard about the handset’s design and looks so far. We just have to wait until March 29 now to find out more about the Galaxy S8. \nUpdate: A couple of high-res photos of the Galaxy S8 have been leaked online by the same source.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:11:50.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
