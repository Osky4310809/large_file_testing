Tories challenge Theresa May over 'worse than feared' Brexit speech \nMs May told the World Economic Forum in Davos she would “make the case for free markets, free trade and globalization”, while responding to people’s concerns about the impact. \nAnd she said: “We are by instinct a great, global, trading nation that seeks to trade with countries not just in Europe but beyond Europe too. \n“A Global Britain is no less British because we are a hub for foreign investment. Indeed, our biggest manufacturer, Tata, is Indian – and you still can’t get more British than a Jaguar or a Land Rover.” \nBut the speech was delivered against the backdrop of a business backlash against Ms May’s speech this week, which was widely seen as threatening a ‘hard Brexit’. \nOne leading bank, HSBC, indicated that it plans to move 1,000 jobs from the bank's London business to Paris in direct response to EU withdrawal. \nBarclays is looking to route activities through Ireland and Germany, while Switzerland's UBS is preparing to move posts from the UK to the continent. \nFurthermore – in the starkest warning issued yet – leading carmaker Toyota said it was working out how it could “survive” Brexit. \nIts chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, told the Financial Times: “We have seen the direction of the Prime Minister of the UK, we are now going to consider, together with the suppliers, how our company can survive.” \nMs May’s use of the phrase “Global Britain” could be seen as a retort to a German newspaper which carried the front-page headline “Little Britain”, after her Brexit speech. \nBut, in Davos, the Prime Minister – despite backing Remain – turned full circle by praising voters for having the courage to vote to leave the EU. \nShe acknowledged the road ahead “will be uncertain at times”, but said it promised “a brighter future for our country’s children, and grandchildren too”.
