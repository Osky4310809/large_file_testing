Something that might have been helpful to them since during their last seven months out in the wilderness the show wasn’t even on the air!\nSo when the final 10 contestants finally emerged back into civilization (13 had already quit) they were met with quite a surprise.\nReports The Press and Journal …\nIntended as a combination of reality TV and sociology experiment, the participants were challenged to create a new model of society. But just as in the Biblical Eden, temptation proved too strong on the Ardnamurchan Peninsula.\nWith the group torn apart by sexual jealousy, hunger and feuds, more than half the cast quit.\nStruggling to live off the land, they resorted to smuggling in junk food and booze.\nLocal resident Maria Macpherson said yesterday: “The last 10 have left. In the end the show was a joke. Some of the participants were even seen in the dentist at Fort William needing treatment after eating chicken feed grit.\n“It has not done this area any favours – it has just not lived up to expectations.”\nApparently not, since only four episodes ever aired. \n\nOn the plus side, I guess, The Press and Journal reports, “A Channel 4 spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that Eden had ‘drawn to a close’ and would be aired later, but no date had been confirmed.”\nSo, uh, yeah, I’m sure that will make the contestants feel a whole lot better about losing a year of their lives, right?\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:17:17.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
