Roseann Sdoia’s life was changed forever when she lost most of her right leg during the 2013 Boston bombing as she neared the finish line. Firefighter Mike Materia was Roseann’s rescuer that day, and now, four years later, the two are engaged! The bombing was a horrible event in our country’s terribly recent history, and it’s left many scars on those who witnessed it, both literally and otherwise. But there’s something so incredibly moving about the fact that something wonderful grew out of this tragedy , and brought these two people together.\n@cafoundation runner Roseann Sdoia brings quite an inspirational story to this year's ESB Run-Up. During the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Roseann lost much of her right leg to an explosive device as she neared the finish line. However, she never quit excelling as a runner. On February 1st, Roseann will compete in our 86-story race alongside her rescuer-turned-fiancé, Mike Materia, who will be in full firefighting gear during the climb. We wish them both a great race! #ESBRU #EmpireStateBuilding \nA photo posted by Empire State Building (@empirestatebldg) on Jan 24, 2017 at 3:36pm PST \nRecently, the couple climbed the 1,576 steps to the top of the Empire State Building to raise money for the Challenged Athletes Association. Roseann wore her prosthesis, and Mike wore his full fire fighter uniform, complete with a heavy oxygen tank. Um, we can barely climb the stairs to our offices, so like. Major props.\nBoston Globe/ Getty Images Even though the Boston Bombing was obviously a horrible event, and we’re sure was traumatic for Roseann, Roseann’s memory of riding in the ambulance with Mike made us smile a little. She told the New York Times :\n“He was kneeling on the ground, trying to hold me from sliding, trying to hold himself, and trying to hold the tourniquet. And then here I am, telling him to hold my hand! So the poor guy had a lot going on.” Apparently, after seeing Roseann to the hospital, Mike went to visit to make sure she was okay, and then visited again after that, and again after that…We hope these two love birds are incredibly happy together, and we couldn’t love this outcome any more if we tried.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:49:23.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
