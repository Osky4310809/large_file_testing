Image copyright Alan Braby Image caption An illustration showing the grave site with skeleton of the Iron Age woman \nDr Macleod Rivett, an archaeologist at the Stornoway Campus of the University of the Highlands and Islands, said there were many interesting aspects to the burial of the woman at least 1,600 years ago. \nAs well as being laid face down in the stone-lined grave, the bracelet placed next to her head was made of iron with bronze embellishments, the only such find in Scotland. \nThe archaeologist said: \"She was a big strong woman, tall for her time at 5ft 6ins, well-muscled and quite young. \n\"Her burial has been carefully made. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Machair is found on the Hebrides, Northern Isles and parts of the north west Highlands \n\"As well as the beautiful bracelet which was buried with her, and the well-crafted grave itself, the burial was covered in a cairn of pretty, pale-coloured beach pebbles, each no bigger than could be carried in one hand, and each brought from up to a kilometre away, at the shore. \n\"I think she was an important person to her local community - they put a lot of effort into making this a nice grave close to an earlier house, which is evidence of the feelings and memories of the people, their own references back to their past.\" \nThe paper is being prepared for publication.
