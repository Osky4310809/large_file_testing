According to the source, the C-HR will be manufactured in one of Toyota’s factories in Thailand, and will go on sale in early 2018. \nThis is certainly in line with an earlier report, which stated that C-HR production will begin in the country in 2018 . However, details on what will go under the hood of the Thailand-spec C-HR is yet unknown. \nFor the United States market, the C-HR is fitted with a 2.0 litre Dual VVT-i four-cylinder petrol engine (147 PS/187 Nm), paired with a CVT. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan markets get two options – the 8NR-FTS 1.2L turbo four-pot (115 PS/185 Nm) with a Super CVT-i, as well as a hybrid powertrain that is made up of a 1.8 litre VVT-i Atkinson cycle four-cylinder engine, a pair of electric motors and a CVT gearbox (the same combo found in the latest Prius ). \nOutside of Thailand, it has also been reported that the C-HR destined for the Indonesian market could be powered by the same 1.5 litre 2NR-FE Dual VVT-i engine as the Sienta and facelifted Vios . Warih Andang Tjahjono, vice president of PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia (TMMIN) recently stated that the company had the means of producing the model locally . \nWhat about us Malaysians then? Well, there’s currently no word from UMW Toyota on when the C-HR will be launched here, although it will most likely arrive only after it debuts in Thailand and Indonesia. Nonetheless, what powertrain or equipment would you want fitted on the Malaysian-spec C-HR?
