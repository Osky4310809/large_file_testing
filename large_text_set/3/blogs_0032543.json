The company says didn't charge any cash, but their signed contract did require Jennifer to do a few things in return.\nAccording to the lawsuit just filed ... Jenny was supposed to do promotional posts for Sidekick on Instagram or Twitter, once every 3 months. Sidekick says she only posted once, but later deleted it.\nThe company says it's out $54,390 for the boards, which it says were customized for the show. It's suing to get back their investment, plus a few more bucks.\nSidekick threatened to sue Seahawks superstar Richard Sherman a year ago, claiming he also reneged on a promotional deal. \nWe've reached out to J Lo's camp, but haven't heard back yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:28:24.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
