And on the eve of history, those who have supported him the longest are savoring the moment the most. They are people like Stephen Stepanek, a former New Hampshire legislator and GOP operator who backed Trump early in 2015. As POLITICO’s Annie Karni explains , Stepanek’s friend sent him a “card gently urging him to see a psychiatrist.” Now Stepanek is enjoying a complete ticket package to Trump’s inauguration, “access to the inaugural ball, the concert at the Lincoln Memorial, the inaugural parade, and a room at the luxury Fairmont Hotel in Georgetown.”\nStepanek’s “one of a small group of loyalists — some joke they should be called ‘the Mean 15’ — who were with Trump on the basement floor of his bare-bones campaign, enamored by the businessman from day one.”\nMeanwhile, Trump also is savoring this moment — almost three months after his victory. “Since he won the presidency in November, Trump has relished talking about his win, sometimes telling donors it was a surprise, while other times telling friends he knew he was going to win all along,” POLITICO’s Josh Dawsey reports .\nBut stopping to smell the political roses has come at a cost, some say: Trump’s “inability to sometimes move on has sometimes left allies scratching their heads, as they want him to home in on hiring and running the government. In the weeks during the transition, he has often seemed more interested in litigating the past than focusing on the present, these people say.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T03:23:33.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
