DU never had a Junior Olympic level-10 national champion before Karr, who won the all-around, vault, bars and beam titles at the 2016 Junior Olympic Nationals. Helen H. Richardson, The Denver Post Top gymnast Maddie Karr poses for a portrait at the University of Denver on Jan. 18, 2017 in Denver. \nKarr could have enrolled at any school in the country. She chose the Pioneers, who now appear to have their best team ever. Ranked No. 7 nationally for a school-record three consecutive weeks, DU is three meets into a season loaded with Super Six aspirations. Karr already has won two all-around titles and four individual titles, and the Pioneers are coming off a team score of 196.875 last week at Utah — the program’s fifth-best road score. \n“We were obviously so excited when she chose DU,” coach Melissa Kutcher-Rinehart said of Karr, who stands 5-foot-5. “She has a tremendous work ethic, a drive to improve, she loves competition, and obviously I think she has great opportunity to break Nina McGee’s record” as individual national champion” \nKarr’s finalists when choosing a school were DU and LSU, a perennial Super Six power. \n“It came down to academics, coaching — just putting it all together,” Karr said. “This was just a perfect fit for me. Coming from Minnesota, I wanted to stay with the Midwestern values, and this school is phenomenal.” \nDU had a No. 14 preseason ranking before winning meets at the University of Minnesota and at home against Air Force, Arizona State and Texas Woman’s University. The Pioneers, who compete Sunday at Morgantown, W.Va., against Temple, Towson and host West Virginia, finished second last week to host Utah in a meet that included Boise State and Illinois-Chicago. \nIn the season opener against the Gophers near Karr’s hometown, she set DU records for freshmen. She owns the highest all-around (39.500), vault (9.925), beam (9.875) and floor (9.900) scores for first-meet newcomers. \nBut make no mistake, it’s all about the team for Karr, who talks about DU like she is a fifth-year senior or graduate assistant coach. \n“We have national championship mentality,” she said. “We want to set records here at DU. We’ve never gone to the Super Six or been a regional champion. We’re definitely looking toward that and making it to nationals — and being in that Super Six.” \nKutcher-Rinehart loves Karr’s leadership. \n“She’s certainly the competitive leader of this team,” the coach said. “Maddie is extremely competitive and always has this drive to improve. It’s very inspiring and it has made a big impact on our team.” \nDU has three preseason injuries preventing it from competing at full strength. The Pioneers are sending only five athletes to the floor and vault events, compared with six for beam and bars. Teams can send six athletes to each event, and the lowest score is dropped. \n“What’s so rewarding about our ranking and how we’re performing is, we’re not actually doing this at full strength and there is incredible pressure on our athletes each and every meet,” Kutcher-Rinehart said. “Adversity can do a lot for teams. It can break you, you can just survive it or it can actually make you better, make you great, and I feel like that is what our team has done. They have thrived and actually gotten better from the adversity.” \nJunior Claire Hammen is out with a foot injury, sophomore Claire Kearn has a leg-bone bruise and Diana Chesnok, also a sophomore, is recovering from ankle surgery. Kutcher-Rinehart said seniors Julia Ross, Rachel Fielitz and Leah Lomonte have provided the glue to this tight-knit team. \n“We’ve been basically climbing this hill for 19 years. It’s been a big hill, a big mountain I should say, but I finally feel like we’re finally on top of it,” the coach said.
