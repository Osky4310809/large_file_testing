Justice Department lawyers now will ask the appeals court either to put the TRO on hold — allowing the executive order to be enforced again — or to cancel it altogether. It was not immediately clear which the lawyers would do or when they would do so.\nOn Friday night, US Customs and Border Protection held a call with airlines instructing them that things should basically go back to how they were before the executive order was signed. On Saturday, the State Department made that official in a significant way by reversing the provisional revocation of visas that the department had authorized after Trump signed the order. The Department of Homeland Security, under which CBP is organized, also issued a statement Saturday detailing that DHS stopped implementing the affected sections of the executive order.\nThis is a developing story.
