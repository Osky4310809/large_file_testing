And this year is a good year for film fans, seeing as the Coen Brothers directed an ad for Mercedes-Benz that pays homage (or maybe spoofs) Dennis Hopper's indie road movie, Easy Rider —the ad even stars Peter Fonda! \nCheck it out below: \nThe Coen's ad, which features the Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster, has all the hallmarks of Hopper's 1969 film, including Peter Fonda, who played Wyatt in the film, the Steppenwolf song \"Born to be Wild,\" choppers, and plenty of rough and tumble bikers. \nIt's an interesting premise, though, especially considering the fact that Easy Rider was a film about the counterculture of the late-60s, and the ad has the poster boy for the counterculture, Fonda, closing in a bunch of bikers with his $132,000 Mercedes. Then again, the Coens are masters of subtle cinematic messages. Then again, it's just a Super Bowl ad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:05:38.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
