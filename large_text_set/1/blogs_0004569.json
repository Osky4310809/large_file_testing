During their meeting, Pence discussed President-elect Trump's potential executive orders when he assumes office, The Hill reports.\nAfter the meeting, Pence offered to reporters a general outline of the incoming Trump administration's top priorities.\nThe vice president-elect listed curbing illegal immigration in the U.S., strengthening security along the southern border, infusing the U.S. military with funding, infrastructure spending, and instituting new taxes.\n\"The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare,\" Pence said, according to CNN. \"Obamacare has failed, and the American people have sent a decisive message to Washington D.C. they want Obamacare to be repealed and replaced with healthcare reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.\"\nPence signaled that GOP lawmakers would attempt to repeal portions of the ACA while President-elect Trump shaved away other portions through executive orders, although he did not specify which orders he would issue. Senate Republicans will have to turn in their proposals to repeal the ACA on Jan. 27.\nDuring the vice president-elect's meeting with GOP lawmakers, several House Republicans expressed their wish list for Trump executive orders, The Washington Post reports.\nAmong the requests were that Trump rescind several of President Barack Obama's executive orders to shield protected lands from offshore drilling, carbon emission regulations and civil protections for LGBTQ Americans.\nPence also met with the Senate Minority Leader, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. Shortly after the vice president-elect's statements before the press, Schumer pledged that his colleagues would resist any attempts to dismantle the ACA.\n\"If you are repealing, show us what you'll replace it with,\" Schumer said. \"Then we'll look at what you have and see what you can do.\"\nMeanwhile, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that GOP lawmakers' efforts to repeal to ACA could backfire against them politically.\nEarnest asserted that a battle over the ACA \"is a debate that Democrats can win because of the impact that repealing the law, as Republicans are vowing to do, would have on the lives of people in communities all across the country.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:32:40.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
