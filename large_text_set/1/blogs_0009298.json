I said all season that if he had any sort of setback at all we would retire him straight away.\" \nThe nine-year-old was the top-rated horse in Britain and Ireland for the past two seasons. \nElliott added: \"It's a real sickener for Gigginstown [stables], myself, Bryan Cooper and the whole yard. We knew it was never certain we would get him back to the racecourse and even after that, to get him back to his best. But we were hopeful and he was on track for a run at Gowran Park next month. \n\"It was one of the highlights of my career when Don Cossack won the Gold Cup for us last year and he retires a champion. A peaceful retirement awaits him out in Gigginstown.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T14:03:16.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
