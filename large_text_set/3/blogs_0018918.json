He said the body was recovered by the Marine Police at the Onikan end of the lagoon. \nHowever, confirming the claim by the doctor’s mother, the spokesperson for the Zone 2 Police Command, SP Dolapo Badmos said, “The mother has come to identify the body recovered, but she said the deceased was not her son.” \nRecall also that late Dr. Orji’s mother had said a day ago that his sun would be recovered alive. She had expressed optimism during her conversation with sympathisers that her son would return home alive. \nAccording to her, “I am hopeful that my son will be rescued by the emergency officials and not the recovery of his body.” \nShe also stated that his son was not married but that marriage plans were on before the tragedy. \nUntil his death, Dr. Orji worked at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Surulere area of Lagos State, southwest Nigeria. \nHe was said to be on his way to Victoria Island for a meeting with the Medical and Dental Association of Nigeria when the incident happened. \nTemporary reports from Police authorities revealed that the deceased had asked his driver to stop the vehicle before jumping across the bridge and into the water. \nLASEMA said there was a distress call of a man who parked his grey coloured Nissan SUV at about 4:50 pm around Adekunle and jumped into the Lagos lagoon. \nThe agency said the vehicle and the driver had been taken to Adeniji Adele Police Station for further investigation. \nSpokesman of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Mr. Kehinde Adebayo, had said the agency was alerted by concerned Nigerians. \nJust three days after Dr. Orji case, a similar incident has been recorded as a middle-aged woman reportedly jumped into the lagoon in the Maza-Maza area of the state. \nThe woman was, however, rescued following the timely intervention of local fishermen and divers in the area. \nAccording to witnesses, the woman had walked casually to the Maza-Maza bridge in the Mile Two area and to the shock of people around, she took a dive into the lagoon but the fishermen dived in after her and rescued her. \nThe woman, dressed in a blouse and trousers was earlier seen walking aimlessly and when she got to the middle of the bridge, she climbed the rail and jumped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:53:00.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
