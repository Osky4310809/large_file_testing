Joonas understands that Chewbacca is one of the most beloved Star Wars characters, so taking on the mantle from Peter Mayhew is a pretty big deal. Honestly, does anyone NOT love Chewbacca? After all, a hug from Chewbacca can solve all of the major world issues and warm the coldest of hearts — even mine:\nA post shared by Heather Mason (@nerdheather) on Dec 27, 2015 at 7:59pm PST \nThe upcoming Han Solo features younger versions of our favorite characters, with Alden Ehrenreich taking over as Han Solo and Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian, to name a couple. They look like they’re having a great time in the first photo from set. Chewie must be making them all laugh in this photo.\nHan Solo - Smuggler. Scoundrel. Hero.
