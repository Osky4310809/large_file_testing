Oh no!\nAccording to RadarOnline , the momager decided to end things with Corey in order to focus more on her family and their reality show. You'd think after 13 seasons she would've learned how to juggle it all by now. But hey, with all of her kids getting robbed we could see how Momma Jenner would be eager to spend more time with her fam.\nRelated: Kris Proves She Has Talent Once & For All!\nA source close to the famous E! family dished:\n\"Kris told Corey that she needed some space so that she could focus on her family and the show right now…She said that she was getting side-tracked with this relationship and that she needed to put her family before her own needs and wants.\"\nBummer. Apparently, the 61-year-old gave her younger beau his walking papers not long after Valentine's Day (which was also when the twosome were last photographed together).\nWe actually kind of feel badly for Corey, we mean, homeboy has done a lot for the Kardashians.\nIn case you forgot, he was there for Kourtney Kardashian following her very public split with Scott Disick and he rushed to be by Kylie Jenner 's side when someone reportedly broke in .\nNonetheless, it's said the Kardashian matriarch is stressed about KUWTK 's recent plummet in ratings and wants \"to focus on the show right now to ensure that her family stays on air.\" Fair enough.\nSo how exactly is Corey coping with this split?? Well, according to the report, Mr. Gamble is staying out of sight in South Africa as he's on a ski trip with Justin Bieber 's manager, Scooter Braun.\nAlthough, it doesn't sound like Kris and Corey are over for good, BUT the chances of them getting back together are still small. The tipster concluded:\n\"Kris seems to be much less invested in this relationship than she used to be…They are not broken up yet because she has not decided to pull the plug on her and Corey completely, but a lot of people in her inner circle think that Corey was nothing but a rebound from Caitlyn [Jenner] anyways!\"\nOof. Well, we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for any confirmation from the former flames themselves.\nStay tuned!\n[ Image via WENN . ]\nTags: breakups , caitlyn jenner , corey gamble , justin bieber , kourtney kardashian , kris jenner , kuwtk , kylie jenner , love line , reality tv , sad sad , scott disick", "external_links": ["http://goo.gl/txtL97"], "published": "2017-03-29T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:32:25.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
