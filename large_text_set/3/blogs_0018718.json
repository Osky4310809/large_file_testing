Hotel collapses into river after torrential rain in Peru \nWith temperatures still high, the meteorological agency expects the rain front to move inland and south over the coming days and has issued a highest level weather warning for the Amazon part of the Cusco, Ucayali and Huanuco regions. \nIt is not the first time this year that Peru has been affected. According to the National Emergency Operations Centre, the toll since January is 62 deaths, 11 missing and 12,000 destroyed homes. Two months ago, tourists in Machu Picchu were stranded by mudslides and had to be airlifted. \nPeruvian president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said no one could have predicted the extreme weather conditions in Lima and the country’s north. \n“We are considering a (state of emergency in the capital) and we will decide tomorrow whether to take this action or not,” the president told local media . The premier Fernando Zavala said 176 districts have already declared emergencies. \nAbraham Levy, a Peruvian meteorologist, said the weather conditions were “extremely unusual” and the storms and flooding were caused by the “atypical” warming of sea surface temperatures off Peru’s northern coast by five to six degrees to 29C. \nHe described the phenomenon as a “coastal El Niño”. The last time this was seen was nearly a century ago in 1925. \n“We’ve had these kinds of El Niños as long as we have historical data, so it’s very difficult to link climate change or even global warming to these events,” he said. \nOther scientists say a global trend of rising sea temperatures was likely to have contributed to the recent storms. Opposition politicians have accused the government of failing to respond adequately to forecasts of increasingly frequent extreme weather events. \n“We know the ‘coastal El Niño’ comes from time to time. We know we are a country that is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. We should have prepared ourselves better,” said the leader of the New Peru movement, Verónika Mendoza, earlier this week. \nThe frustrations of those affected were evident in Tambogrande, PIURA, where dozens called for help as the country’s education minister Marilu Martens briefly visited the town by helicopter. \n“We are dealing with this emergency in the short term, but of course we need long-term strategies to avoid these situations so the people are not continually suffering in these emergencies,” Martens told the Guardian. She said the government has set aside $800m Peruvian soles for Peru’s hard-hit north and would implement programmes to prevent the spread of water-borne diseases such as dengue, which is spread by mosquitos which breed in stagnant water.
