But I love my India. There are many reasons for this. But the most important, I guess, is the fact that India offers me what no other country can: The right to be myself. In fact, that is the most wonderful thing about this land. It is not, and never was a nation to begin with. It is and was always about all of us, different people with different values and cultures standing together under one flag and trying to build a nation we can be proud of.\nYou have a young Virat Kohli struggling to break away from the huge, overbearing legacy of Sachin and create one of his own. You also have the Shillong Chamber Choir, founded 15 years ago in a remote corner, that defied our overwhelming obsession with Hindi film music and won by a mile a popular talent show, voted to victory by people who had never heard of them. You have a forgotten Kailash Satyarthi, who the media ignored for years, winning the Nobel for his work as a child rights campaigner. There’s Badal Sarkar trying to redefine the language of theatre, on one hand. On the other, you have many local theatre forms trying very hard to be noticed over the cacophony of mass media. Wherever you look, it’s the challenge of the lone voice to be heard, listened to.\nGurmehar Kaur\nAnd it is these lone voices together that form the collective voice of the new India struggling to be heard in what must be one of the world’s noisiest nations. Yet surprisingly, it is those who speak in whispers who bring about change, real change. Those you never hear of are doing the most amazing work which goes largely unreported. Headlines are grabbed every morning by rapists, murderers, thugs and self appointed propagandists for caste and communal politics. Those who shriek the loudest are heard most often while the great classical arts languish in small pockets of excellence in a country more eager to be known as an economic super power. And that is why my India is all about discovery.\nI wake up to a phantom flautist on early Sunday mornings, trying desperately to be heard over the hysteria of horns down the street outside my window. For years I have been trying to catch him but by the time I race down the staircase to reach him, he is gone. The insane noise of Mumbai traffic takes over. This is true for poets I try to reach out to, music I want to listen to, words I want to hear, snatches of songs that serendipitously reach me. India is a tribute to the most amazing ephemeral moments, moments that can never be captured. The best of India is what comes and goes and can never be preserved. Like sunsets that vanish before the camera’s aperture shuts.\nYesterday I saw a young girl on social media holding up a small placard with a message for all of us. She had lost her soldier father in the war. Yet she refused to yield to self pity. Instead, she upheld a message of hope and courage and great dignity. Within minutes, nay seconds, there were vultures swooping in. A retired cricketer threw the first stone. A popular actor supported him. And then came the rest. An angry, abusive mob baying for her blood. These were followed by rape and death threats. All for saying what she hoped would change the language of discourse in our time.\nBut young Gurmehar Kaur is not alone. That’s where hope lies. There are hundreds and thousands like her speaking in whispers everywhere and they are being heard over the rants and filthy abuse of the mobs who claim to represent what our India is. And therein lies the courage of the lone voice. A young student standing up for what she believes is right; not frightened, not cowering before the vulgar mob. The brave, lonely poet who sings of truth and justice. The forgotten flautist walking down noisy streets, trying to reach a lost music to our battered souls. These are the voices of a great civilization trying to rediscover itself even as everyone else around them are busy building this mighty empire of wealth, power, modernity where the lone individual’s voice must be silenced for the screaming mob to take over.\nThat is why I love India. I love its small voices. I love its lost songs. I love its lonely people fighting a losing battle against the brute power of a state that wants it all. The land; the trees; the forests. Your voice and mine. And the silences that bind us to life, nature, hope and faith.\nAs the bullies fight to grab more space- in the mind, in the cities, in the lost villages that keep India alive in our souls, on the campuses, on the dark lit streets of cities where dying rivers foam and wild beasts hide in nooks and crannies- it is these tiny voices that will one day become the most powerful symphony of courage and resistance. For fear can be fought only when each one of us will stand up and say: This is our India, these are our rivers, our homes, our campuses, these are our dreams and hopes. No one can take them away.\nThat is why I love my India. It has some of the bravest people in the world. Their angst may be ignored. Their voices are often not heard. Their hopes are often trampled on. Many of them are poor and ignorant. But they always stand up, like young Gurmehar, for what they believe is right. Unafraid. And in the darkest of times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T12:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T12:28:49.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
