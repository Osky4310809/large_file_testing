Jan 13, 2017 7:40 PM \n“If I start, I start”– Oswieller. \nWhat is it with the Texans channeling their inner Drago. silverhornet says: Jan 13, 2017 7:41 PM \nThat’s funny… I said the same thing to my wife when she asked me what’s for dinner. jjb0811 says: Jan 13, 2017 7:43 PM \nHe’s always been a miserable SOB. Yelled at Brady when Tom was putting rings on his fingers, moaned at PSU complaining about following in Joe’s footsteps, and now this. Division titles against Ten, Jags and Indy really isn’t bragging rights. emmitt22bates40 says: Jan 13, 2017 7:45 PM \nHouston wouldn’t be smart to let O’Brien walk. The more I see of him the more I think he’s a big time coach. the610limited says: Jan 13, 2017 7:47 PM \nBill Parcells left the Patriots after their SECOND appearance in the Super Bowl 20 years ago. Their first appearance was 31 years ago…SB 20, 46-10 thrashing by da Bears. thechickenexpress says: Jan 13, 2017 7:47 PM \nToo bad Osweiler is turning out to be a such an albatross for this guy and this organization, because O’Brien’s a good coach. O’Brien just needs a QB who can run his offense. If he gets that, the Texans are a team to reckon with. jamesflacco says: Jan 13, 2017 7:50 PM \nRaymond Berry will be surprised to learn that he did not in fact take his Patriots to the Super Bowl in ’85. Jan 13, 2017 7:51 PM \nMcDaniels to San Fran, and O’Brien back to NE as O-Coord again? The Truth says: Jan 13, 2017 7:51 PM \nC’mon Bill Belicheat taught you Romeo and Vrabel everything. Now CHEAT !! Jan 13, 2017 7:52 PM \nKay sera, kay sera…. or however the hell you spell it. pftsucksblog says: Jan 13, 2017 7:52 PM \n1985 actually was The Patriots first Super Bowl. 32 years ago…..And Bill Parcells wasn’t the coach Raymond Berry was. Come on Florio…. harrisonhits2 says: Jan 13, 2017 7:53 PM \n“But that didn’t stop Bill Parcells from leaving the Patriots after taking the team to its first Super Bowl, 20 years ago.” \nUh no, that was the 2nd one. We got crushed by the 85 Bears the first time. \nYou should know your NFL history better than that Mike. rslibertarian says: Jan 13, 2017 7:57 PM \n“But that didn’t stop Bill Parcells from leaving the Patriots after taking the team to its first Super Bowl, 20 years ago.” \nParcells or Raymond Berry…..either one…. \nStand by PFT…..Corrections from New England are coming. mongo3401 says: Jan 13, 2017 7:59 PM \nPats dynasty ends this weekend. Congrats Pats fans, it was a great run 👍 The time has come. Jan 13, 2017 7:59 PM \njjb0811 says: \nJan 13, 2017 7:43 PM \nHe’s always been a miserable SOB. Yelled at Brady when Tom was putting rings on his fingers, moaned at PSU complaining about following in Joe’s footsteps, and now this. Division titles against Ten, Jags and Indy really isn’t bragging rights. \n– \nO’Brien coached in two Super Bowls as a Patriot(one as OC) and lost both. arwiv says: Jan 13, 2017 8:00 PM \nUh, almost good NFL coaches are historically miserable SOB’s. …thats why they are good. The NFL existed prior to the 90’s. arwiv says: Jan 13, 2017 8:01 PM \nI cant blame Florio for wanting to forget that first Pats superbowl. I was only 15 back then and still have nightmares. grogansheroes says: Jan 13, 2017 8:02 PM \nIf I were O’Brien, and I had ANY other option, I would not work for that scumbag owner. ihavepriors says: Jan 13, 2017 8:04 PM \nDeep. My old farm ox used to talk to me this way, late, under the stars in the stalks. Moo! Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
