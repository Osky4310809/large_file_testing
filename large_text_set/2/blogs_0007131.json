Fans chanted \"Oakley! Oakley!\" in support of the popular power forward. \nThe 53-year-old Oakley played for the Knicks from 1988-98, helping them reach the NBA Finals, but has a poor relationship with the team because of his criticisms of Dolan, the Madison Square Garden chairman. \n\"Charles Oakley came to the game tonight and behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner,\" the Knicks wrote in a statement on Twitter . \"He has been ejected and is currently being arrested by the New York City Police Department. He was a great Knick and we hope he gets some help soon.\" \nThe altercation took place just a few rows behind the court during a stoppage in play, and players from both teams turned to watch. \nOakley was handcuffed near an arena exit as he waited for police to arrive. \nThe 6-foot-8 Oakley was a rugged enforcer playing alongside Patrick Ewing on the Knicks teams of the 1990s and has kept his tough-guy persona long after retirement, trading barbs with former rival Charles Barkley recently.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:10:06.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
