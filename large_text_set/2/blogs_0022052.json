It also starred Amala Paul who happened to be making a debut with this film. Even before its release, the buzz around this movie has been huge. The screen count for this movie is reportedly 5000, the largest for a Kannada release. So far Sudeep’s commander avatar has received positive reviews. This film marks the second collaboration between Sudeep and and Ravichandran. So let’s check what reviewers had to say about Hebbuli: \nHere’s what Times of India had to say: \nSudeep is undoubtedly the one leading the pack, looking his most stylish yet till date and giving a performance that makes you want to root for him. Amala Paul had a cute role for her Kannada debut and she shares a good chemistry with Sudeep. The three main antagonists, Ravi Kishan, P Ravi Shankar and Kabir Duhan Singh, justify their casting and do a good job. Chikkanna’s comedy track, which is funny take on Vishnuvardhan’s Bandhana, is worth a mention too. \nCeleb Cinema had to say this: \nIn short, the audience will get to witness the dangerous side of a rebel army man in the Kannada flick. Sudeep Realistic Acting, Fighting & Walking Style are Just Superb. Amala paul, Arjun janya, Ravishankar has done justice to their character. Director Krishna’s hard work is very much apparent in all the scene n he worked well on the screenplay. Action sequences are good.. without more build up neatly covered with emotions. \nBut Indian Express found Sudeep’s act repetitive: \nSudeep’s choice of clothing and his mannerisms do not match his character as a para commando. We have seen Sudeep doing the things he does in Hebbuli in all most all of his films in the past. As an audience, we expected some variation in Hebbuli and it is conspicuous by its absence. The film has multiple villains played by Arasikere Anjinappa and Ravi Kishan but both characters fail to leave a mark on the screen.
