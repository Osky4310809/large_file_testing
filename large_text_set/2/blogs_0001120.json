I would say it’s up to Mitch, but I would say, ‘Go for it.’ ” \nDemocrats will no doubt say they have concerns over Neil Gorsuch, that they need time to consider, that they refuse to act. As Philip Wegman wrote, “It’s embarrassing enough that they have to fight Neil Gorsuch, a Supreme Court nominee whom they once unanimously supported. But now they must defend a position they spent all of last year blasting as indefensible.” \nThe GOP, in a nice move, has already made a commercial that uses Democratic lawmaker’s own words against them: \nWouldn’t it be nice if our politicians did what was best for the nation, regardless of who’s in power?
