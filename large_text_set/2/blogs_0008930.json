Just a reminder to all the guys out there to grab some flowers and candy. \nWith that in mind, Russian President Vladimir Putin is considering giving President Donald Trump a gift. \nThe gift of Edward Snowden. \nYes. For real. \nFrom CNBC : \nU.S. intelligence has collected information that Russia is considering turning over Edward Snowden as a “gift” to President Donald Trump — who has called the NSA leaker a “spy” and a “traitor” who deserves to be executed. \nThat’s according to a senior U.S. official who has analyzed a series of highly sensitive intelligence reports detailing Russian deliberations and who says a Snowden handover is one of various ploys to “curry favor” with Trump. A second source in the intelligence community confirms the intelligence about the Russian conversations and notes it has been gathered since the inauguration. \nWell, this is certainly interesting, huh? \nI’m assuming Putin has no more use for Snowden and this point and believes gifting him to Trump would make talk of sanctions relief that much easier. \nI can see liberals having a field day with this one. \nStay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:07:11.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
