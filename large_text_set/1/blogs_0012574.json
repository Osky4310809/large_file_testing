She wasn’t yet one of the stars of the team, but was a solid competitor that earned high scores. Led by Shannon Miller and Kim Zmeskal , the US team earned bronze, and Dawes, along with teammate Betty Okino, became the first African-American female gymnasts to win an Olympic medal. \ncontinue reading below our video Profile of Nastia Liukin The 1993 worlds was her coming-out party. And she went for broke. \nIn 1993 Dawes was quickly becoming one of the best gymnasts in the world, and at World Championships that year, she led the all-around field after three events. Knowing that she needed a very strong vault to win, she gambled on a new vault – a 1.5–twisting Yurchenko – and lost. She fell on her second attempt , and ended up fourth overall. Teammate Miller took the all-around title, but Dawes served notice that she would be an all-around force in the coming years. Dawes also grabbed two silver medals in the event finals on bars and on beam. She had another agonizing near-miss one year later. \nThe all-around at the 1994 worlds was again a heartbreak for Dawes. As in ’93, Dawes competed vault last, and once again, fell on one of her attempts . She ended up fifth in the all-around, and was further disappointed in the event finals, finishing fourth on bars and sixth on beam and floor. But she made history in 1994 as well. \nAt the 1994 US nationals, Dawes showed that she could, in fact, beat the top gymnast in the world. Dawes bested two-time world all-around champion Miller on every event and the all-around. Dawes brought home five gold medals from the competition, and became the second woman after Joyce Tanac-Schroeder to complete a sweep of every event and the all-around at US nationals. She was a member of the Mag 7. \nDawes qualified to her second Olympic team by winning the Olympic Trials (with the absence of ’96 national champion Miller and ’95 national champion Dominique Moceanu ). The team, nicknamed “The Magnificent Seven ”, was heralded as the best US Olympic team ever assembled, and the squad lived up to its name. The US gymnasts became the first American women’s team to win Olympic gold . \nDawes had another disappointing all-around competition, however. She was leading the competition after two events when an uncharacteristic fall on floor knocked her out of the medals. Dawes came back strong in the individual event finals, winning a bronze on floor and placing fourth on bars. And was named to three Olympic teams. \nDawes retired after the ’96 Games, but returned to competition in 2000 to try for an unlikely third Olympic team. After a seventh place finish at Olympic Trials, Dawes was named to the team. In Sydney, the team took fourth place, just out of the medals, but later was awarded the bronze when China was retroactively disqualified from the competition . All the kids' names in her family start with \"D.\" \nDawes was born on November 20, 1976 in Silver Spring, Maryland to Don and Loretta Dawes. She has an older sister, Danielle, and a younger brother, Don Jr. \nDawes began gymnastics at age six and trained her entire career with Kelli Hill at Hill’s Gymnastics. \nShe retired from the sport after the 2000 Olympics, and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Maryland in 2002. Dawes served as president of the Women’s Sports Federation from 2004 until 2006, and was a commentator for Yahoo! Sports at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. She also works as a motivational speaker and hosts clinics for young gymnasts throughout the US.
