Just another terrible decision!” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.\nBut Trump’s accusation is inaccurate. As of July 15, 2016, a total of 693 Guantanamo Bay detainees had been transferred — 122 of whom were confirmed to have reengaged in terrorist activities, according to a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\nOf those 122 people, 113 were released under former President George W. Bush. Just nine were released under Obama.\nTrump’s tweet followed a Fox & Friends segment on a U.S. airstrike in Yemen that killed a former Guantanamo Bay detainee.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:04:29.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
