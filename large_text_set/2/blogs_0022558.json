Bess, a historian of the US-Mexico borderlands at CIDE, a research institute in Mexico.\nDuring his first five weeks in office, Trump has lost his first national security advisor, declared the news media the “enemy” of the American people, withdrawn from the Trans-Atlantic Partnership trade deal, and strained relations with Australia after engaging in a protocolary but ultimately heated phone call with its prime minister.\nAnd just one week after his inauguration, Trump drew the ire of both the Mexican political class and the general population after tweeting that an upcoming meeting with Peña Nieto should be cancelled if Mexico remained unwilling to pay for a 2,000 mile-long border wall.\nPeña Nieto wound up canceling his entire visit to the US in response. During a follow-up phone call intended to quell tensions, Trump warned Peña Nieto that he would send troops to Mexico to “stop bad hombres down there.”\nThat’s all compounded by a sense of uncertainty both on who in the administration is in charge of foreign policy — Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is a top White House advisor and took the lead during Videgaray’s visit to the US — and on the president’s mercurial sense of priorities.\nAs if to highlight the point, Trump called impending deportations a “military operation” to get “really bad dudes out of” the US on Thursday. Kelly was then left to dispute that on camera just hours later.\n“If Trump changes his mind tomorrow on what was said, then the meeting is pointless,” said Bess of Tillerson’s visit to Mexico.\nThe growing frustration in Mexico was underscored by a protest planned outside the US embassy on Thursday. Earlier this month, Mexicans and Americans poured into the streets to demonstrate against Trump’s discriminatory policies and demand a respectful attitude from the leader.\nEnmity between the neighbors has been escalating since Trump made scapegoating Mexico for crime and unemployment in the US a pillar of his presidential campaign, blaming the country for sending “rapists” across the border, accusing it of taking jobs from Americans, and threatening to deport millions of undocumented Mexican immigrants.\nTrump has also ordered a review of US aid to Mexico by Friday. Since 2008, Congress has appropriated $2.5 billion for a program known as the Merida Initiative to help Mexico fight crime.\nThe diplomatic duel comes at a challenging time for Peña Nieto: his approval ratings have dipped to near-single digits after four years marred by corruption scandals, growing crime rates and a flagging economy.\nCritics say Peña Nieto’s reactions to Trump’s insults have been at best lukewarm and at worst friendly, like when he invited the then-candidate to Mexico on an official visit. Then-Finance Minister Videgaray was forced to resign after reportedly orchestrating the meeting, only to be appointed foreign minister five months later.\nPeople have also accused Peña Nieto of taking too long to develop a strategy to protect Mexicans living in the US illegally, including unifying and strengthening the country’s network of consulates, even though mass deportations were one of Trump’s earliest campaign promises.\nIt wasn’t just Mexicans that were upset by Thursday’s visit. Hundreds of Americans living in Mexico signed an open letter to Tillerson and Ambassador Roberta Jacobson earlier this week.\n“Our families are these Mexicans. We worship in their churches. We attend our children’s soccer games together. We depend on Mexico’s welcoming attitudes and good will to help us navigate our lives here,” the letter explained. “President Trump is undermining that environment.”\nThe scrapped meeting between Trump and Peña Nieto has yet to be rescheduled.", "external_links": ["https://www.change.org/p/us-ambassador-to-mexico-open-letter-from-us-citizens-in-mexico-to-us-ambassador-and-sec-of-state-regarding-trump?recruiter=8620208&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=autopublish&utm_term=des-lg-share_petition-no_msg", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2017/02/23/trump-calls-deportations-a-military-operation.html?via=desktop&source=copyurl", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/02/trump-did-not-threaten-war-with-mexico-u-s-and-mexican-officials-agree/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73GzY4hPpQM"], "published": "2017-02-24T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:21:10.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
