After teasing it all season long, Randall's biological father, William, lost his battle with cancer during Tuesday night's episode. While the cast was certainly emotional about the beloved character's bittersweet goodbye, some of the best (and most relatable) reactions came from the fans. See some of the best moments on social media right here.
