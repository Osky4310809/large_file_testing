We're back with our last round of videos for this go of the Daily SEO Fix series. To recap, here are the other topics we've covered previously: \nYour Daily SEO Fix: The Keyword Research Edition Your Daily SEO Fix: Link Building & Ranking Zero Today we'll be delving into more keyword and concept research, quick wins for on-page optimization, and a neat way to stay abreast of duplicates and inaccuracies in your local listings. We use Moz Pro , the MozBar , and Moz Local in this week's fixes. \nFix #1: Grouping and analyzing keywords by label to judge how well you're targeting a concept The idea of \"concepts over keywords\" has been around for a little while now, but tracking rankings for a concept isn't quite as straightforward as it is for keywords. In this fix, Kristina shows you how to label groups of keywords to track and sort their rankings in Moz Pro so you can easily see how you're ranking for grouped terms, chopping and analyzing the data as you see fit. \nFix #2: Adding alternate NAP details to uncover and clean up duplicate or inaccurate listings If you work in local SEO, you know how important it is for listings to have an accurate NAP (name, address, phone number). When those details change for a business, it can wreak absolute havoc and confuse potential searchers. Jordan walks you through adding alternate NAP details in Moz Local to make sure you uncover and clean up old and/or duplicate listings, making closure requests a breeze. ( This Whiteboard Friday is an excellent explanation of why that's really important; I like it so much that I link to it in the resources below, too. ;) \n\nRemember, you can always use the free Check Listing tool to see how your local listings and NAP are popping up on search engines: \nIs my NAP accurate? \nFix #3: Research keywords and concepts to fuel content suggestions — on the fly You're already spying on your competitors' sites; you might as well do some keyword research at the same time, right? Chiaryn walks you through how to use MozBar to get keyword and content suggestions and discover how highly ranking competitor sites are using those terms. (Plus a cameo from Lettie Pickles, star of our 2015 Happy Holidays post !) \nFix #4: Discover whether your pages are well-optimized as you browse — then fix them with these suggestions A fine accompaniment to your on-the-go keyword research is on-the-go on-page optimization. (Try saying that five times fast.) Janisha gives you the low-down on how to check whether a page is well-optimized for a keyword and identify which fixes you should make (and how to prioritize them) using the SEO tool bar. \nFurther reading & fond farewells I've got a whole passel of links if you're interested in reading more educational content around these topics. And by \"reading,\" I mean \"watching,\" because I really stacked the deck with Whiteboard Fridays this time.
