The Creators Project asked me to pull together a weekly roundup of the best newly-released pins. Most of these will probably sell out. If you like them, smash that \"add to cart\" button. \nYesterday was Valentine's Day, so whether you're madly in love or single as a dog, you're probably disappointed. Let me relieve your pain with some wonderful niché consumer goods, you fine young millenn—sorry. These pins have it all, from heart-shaped bagel sandwiches to heart-shaped cheeseburgers. Somehow the pin community saves my ass with great new releases every week for 54 weeks straight now. Let's give them a round of applause. Shop Fryday \nI'm surprised no one had done this one yet. It's difficult to be embarrassed by stuff you did when you were eight, but it's truly bizarre how much joy eight-year-olds get out of writing BOOBS on a calculator. As society continues to deteriorate and our education system crumbles, those who remember this \"cool calculator trick\" just might inherit the earth. \n$6.00 here . Midnight Dogs \nEven though I couldn't say what it was about, who the characters were, or what happened, I loved this show. I think. I just watched it all the time and my sugar-addled ADD brain lit up with fervor. \n$10.00 here . Collaborative Goods \nThis pin is outrageously cheap, so it'd be stupid not to get it. I can't say I truly love that many things, but lox on a bagel is certainly up there. Not to mention, this pin is cheaper than most sandwiches. \n$4.00 here . The DNA Life \nHey, it's wacky but I like it. Other than the fact that it reminds me of the leg statue lamp from A Christmas Story , I'm not quite sure why. Maybe someone in the porn community would enjoy buying a bunch of these and starting a fake porn influence mafia. Pretty sure it already exists, though. \n$10.00 here . Whitey \nNo one appreciates Valentine's Day. If two people say they do, they simply don't know each other well enough yet. So why not direct our love towards something that always gives back? I've felt pure love while eating a good cheeseburger. I know you have too. \nThat's all, folks. Check out Strike Gently Co today. \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:48:12.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
