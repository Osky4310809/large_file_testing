Thanks to Sonakshi Sinha that all we can think about now is the plush blue island that’s surrounded by water on all four sides. The diva shared two pictures on her Instagram recently which screams ‘gorgeous’. One thing we’ve learnt by now is that the Dabangg actress is a total waterbaby. Most of her vacation pictures take us to this parallel universe that only has sparkly blue water shining across the horizon! This time too, Sonakshi decided to take a vacation to Maldives and boy is the locale gorgeous. The diva shared two pictures from what looks like a water bungalow. In both the pics, it’s pretty evident that the place Sona has visited is a scenic bliss. Not to forgot how hot she is looking, wearing those beachy ensembles. Clearly, Sonakshi has transformed quite a lot. \nWhat keeps us curious though is with whom has she taken this mini vacay with. For quite a while now there have been rumours that Sona is dating Bunty Sajdeh, a businessman. In fact, buzz also suggests that the actress is pretty serious about her bae. Well, we’re not really sure about what’s cooking in her personal life but we’d definitely want to know who has accompanied her in this dreamy beach vacation. You folks can check out pics from her Maldives rendezvous below. ( ALSO READ – What fall-out?
