You will need water, oil, a scouring sponge, and time for a \"let soak overnight\" step. Here is how it goes: 1. Rub a little oil on the label. \nThe hardest part! Drop some oil right on the label, and use your pointer to rub it over every part of the label. That's it. \nA note on \"oil\": I have yet to find an oil that does not work for this task. (I have tried olive, extra-virgin olive, sesame, vegetable, avocado, peanut, and a strange flavored garlic oil, all with equal success.) Feel free to use a fancy dropper of eucalyptus oil, which smells very good, if it pleases you. Or reach for that cheap bottle of canola oil that you bought in a dire situation once and rarely ever use. You be you. \nOther oily substances, such as mayonnaise or peanut butter, will also work—but I find find mayonnaise fingers a little grody and the use of peanut butter a little... wasteful. However, it's up to you. A light layer all over the label will do. No need to gob it on. Cover the oiled jars with warm water. Photo by James Ransom 2. Cover the oiled jar with warm water. \nI typically set a mixing bowl or pitcher in the sink, put the oiled jar in it, and pour warm water all over top—including inside the jar, so it stays sunk. Sometimes I use hot water, if I'm feeling hateful towards a particular label; sometimes I just use warm. Eventually, it's going to come to room temperature anyway; the exact starting temperature doesn't matter. 3. Leave it there overnight. \nIn the morning, while you are waiting for your coffee to percolate, remove the jar and pour out the oily (hopefully not mayonnaise-y) water. Rinse the jar. 4. Remove the label using a scouring sponge. \nNot a soft sponge, not steel wool. I use these green scrubby scouring pads , cut into inch-wide slivers (after a few labels, they'll get a little gunky and need to be trashed, so there's no reason to waste the whole pad at once). After the oil + soak combo, the label—paper and sticky stuff and all—will come off easily, and it will be very, very satisfying. \nYou'll only need to employ gentle pressure with your scouring pad. You will not need to \"pick\" at anything, or scrub vigorously. Yes, the super sticky layer will come off, too! Photo by James Ransom 5. Clean as you normally would. \nSoap and water or a cycle through the dishwasher, to remove the oil. Now, your jar is ready to re-use! \nYes, there are five steps and one requires an overnight lapse—nobody said this would be \"quick.\" But it's effective every time, largely hands off, and possible no matter how fancy or unfancy your oil selection is . \nLove,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:57:27.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
