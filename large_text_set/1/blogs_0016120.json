But most recently, in the past few years, especially during the second term of Obama's administration, that unfriendly activity towards our diplomats has been growing in scale ,” Lavrov said at a news conference on Tuesday. \nAccording to the minister, US diplomats have also engaged in espionage in Russia and actively participated in the rallies staged by Russian opposition forces. \n“ In addition to spying, US Embassy diplomats have repeatedly been seen taking part in the rallies of opposition, anti-government forces, unauthorized rallies, including times when they wore disguise. Do the math yourselves ,” Lavrov stated. \nREAD MORE: US intel may have contributed to Russian ex-Foreign Minister Primakov’s death, Zakharova reveals \nLavrov dismissed allegations made by the Obama administration, which complained that the US Embassy in Russia was forced to work under allegedly intolerable conditions, with the US Ambassador “ cut off ” from all contacts, saying that evidence shows the situation was “ absolutely the opposite ”– that the diplomats’ movements were never restricted. \n“ They [the US diplomats] go to Kaliningrad, Leningrad, Murmansk, Voronezh regions.
