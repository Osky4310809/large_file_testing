This cap was lowered to Rs 2 lakh through an amendment. \nTo reconcile the two provisions, the tax at source on goods and services, including jewellery, has now been removed through an amendment to the Finance Bill, 2017. \nThe amendment, along with other changes, were approved by the Lok Sabha yesterday. \nThe amendment scrapped sub-sections (1D) and (1E) from Section 206C with respect to TCS. \nOfficial sources said Section 206C(1D) was inserted through the Finance Act, 2016, expanding the scope of Section 206C to include in its ambit cash-sale of goods and services exceeding Rs 2 lakh. \nIn the latest Budget, Jaitley made cash transactions above Rs 2 lakh punishable by a fine of an equivalent amount. \nThe fine is to be paid by receiver of cash. \nThe income tax department has been levying 1 percent TCS on cash purchase of bullion in excess of Rs 2 lakh and jewellery upwards of Rs 5 lakh since 1 July, 2012. \nHowever, the Budget for 2016-17 had imposed TCS of 1 percent on goods and services purchased in cash over Rs 2 lakh. \n 39  39 pm Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:24:55.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
