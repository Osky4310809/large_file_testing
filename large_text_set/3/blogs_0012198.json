They were eliminated two rounds earlier than last season when Manuel Pellegrini guided the side to a first Champions League semi-final . \nYet Guardiola received positive communication from Mubarak. “The chairman? I received a text message from him the day after,” he said. “He prefers to win the Champions League. He was not there [at Stade Louis II] but he is always close to me. So I always feel always he is there, so close to the team, so close to me. Raheem Sterling in shape to show Liverpool he made the right move Read more \n“But he knows, I know better than him, how it works. I always feel in the good moments and bad moments, especially in the bad moments, I appreciate his reaction. I am really impressed.” \nIn each of his previous seven years as a manager Guardiola has won a trophy. City are in the FA Cup semi-finals yet he accepts this could be a first campaign without silverware but feels more energised than ever. \n“I have more power than ever in my life as a manager,” he said. “For me it’s a big challenge and I want to deal with that. I want to see myself if I am able to do that; that is my impression.” \nIn the summer the futures of up to 18 City players will be in the balance for reasons of contract, form and physical condition. Guardiola said: “All the managers and sporting directors want to improve and get better. Maybe the team that wins the treble will still make changes, the team that does not win the Champions League and gets to the final will make changes, so I knew that. I met Sheikh Mansour in Abu Dhabi and I know the plan. It’s a team that took the next step seven years ago and we are thinking about how to get better. I want to be involved in that as much as possible and to help my team to make the next step.” \nVincent Kompany is fit again yet after travelling with the squad to Monaco and to Middlesbrough for City’s previous outing he was not included. The captain is suffering a third injury blighted season and ‘Guardiola admitted he could not rely on the defender not breaking down. \n“There is a reason why he didn’t play, because he was injured,” he said. “And putting him on the field for maybe 15 or 20 minutes, because I know when it was 2-1 I thought about that we might need him against the tall players of Monaco on the field to defend those kind of situations. But he was a long time injured and sometimes he arrived [played] but was injured again so I could risk him and to be safe and be so sure [he would last].” \nGuardiola had hoped Kompany would get the chance to prove his fitness with Belgium this month but Roberto Martínez opted not to select the centre-half. Martínez claimed Kompany still had a big part to play for Belgium but said: “It is important we don’t bring him in if he’s not fully ready and not fully match fit.” Pep Guardiola set for Manchester City clearout with 18 players at risk Read more \nYaya Touré’s agent, Dimitri Seluk, has said he has held talks over a possible move for the midfielder, whose contract at City expires this summer. “From yesterday we officially started negotiating with different clubs about his future,” he told Sky Sports News. \n“We waited until 15 March for what Manchester City will say but until now Manchester City don’t say anything. Before March, we didn’t negotiate with anybody because Yaya does a lot with Manchester City , so we waited. But we cannot wait until the last minute, until June, and have no negotiations with anybody.” \nTouré has said he wants to stay at City and Guardiola has indicated contract issues will be dealt with at the end of the season. Seluk said: “Some clubs have contacted me. Now we have three options. I don’t speak about Yaya and China or the MLS. He will play in Europe. I have spoken with clubs in different countries – Italy and Spain. I said to Manchester City that we will start negotiations with other clubs about the future of Yaya. After that, if Manchester City want, they can start negotiations. If they don’t want then we will find another club.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T19:43:50.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
