If you want to see an unedited photo you can here , but you’ve been warned.\nExtensive surgery was required and the details are not for the faint of heart. Dr. Rafael Vázquez Bayod spoke with Univision about what he needed to do.\n\"The goring is very serious, very serious, a very, very severe injury in the anorectal region. It was a very powerful horn that completely destroyed the anal sphincter and seriously damaged the rectum.\" \nThink that’s the worst thing you’ll read today? It gets worse. The doctor had to determine the extent of the injury. It was at this time they realized just how damaging the goring was. They learned on examination that 11.8 inches of the man’s rectum was damaged and it would need more serious surgery than first expected.\nWhat followed were plans to fully reconstruct the bullfighter’s anus and rectum, which happened on Monday. There have been no further updates, but hopefully everything went well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:48:43.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
