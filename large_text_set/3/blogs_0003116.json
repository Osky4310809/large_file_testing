It was no great feat choosing the greatest. But I did it. Here are the all-time best Nicktoon characters! Chuckie Finster \nHe is a very cowardly baby and that makes him unbelievably sweet. Chuckie makes this list complete with his very adorable presence. Ickis \nIckis is a monster who is also a coward, and because of this he has made the list. (I'm big on cowards.) Ren and Stimpy \nRen & Stimpy remain a key part of animation history, and also one of them once pretended a fart was a baby. That alone should grant them a spot on this list. Meltman \nMeltman is a hideous melting man from Kablam ’s \"Action League Now\". Although many have forgotten him, I didn’t. How could I? He is the Meltman. Roger Klotz \nRoger is a complex bully man whose leather jacket is amazing. Roger will grow up to be awful, but at least he lived, damn it! Unlike that dipsh*t Doug… oh, don’t get me started on Doug. Dagget \nHe is a beaver who yells. A classic of the animation genre. Invader Zim \nZim is the most complex of the Nicktoons — he lives in an amoral universe where children cheer for him to destroy the world. Bless you, Zim, you nihilistic cartoon bug man. Shriek \nDid you know Shriek the Greaser from CatDog was one of the first roles of legendary comedian Maria Bamford? That’s more than enough reason to put her on this list, right? I think so. Helga \n(source) \nHelga liked Arnold, but could not help being a giant jerk, and for that she is a queen. These complex jerks — they’re the lifeblood of this amazing world. \nAre these the best of the Nicktoons? I'm sure they are. Let me know how right I am at @AlexFirer !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:25:31.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
