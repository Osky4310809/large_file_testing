Curry is the greatest player in school history, and for everything he’s meant to the program, the Wildcats will name a section of their arena after the former star. Ready to welcome @StephenCurry30 to campus Jan. 24 for dedication of Section 30 in Belk Arena! #CatsAreWild - https://t.co/pVYQpNZFBM pic.twitter.com/zfcTuKw5c4 — Davidson College (@DavidsonCollege) January 12, 2017 \nThe Davidson student section will now be called “Section 30,” which is a nod to Curry’s uniform number. More from the school: \nThe student section in Davidson College’s John M. Belk Arena will be named in honor of the school’s all-time leading scorer and two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry. “Section 30” will be christened during halftime of the Wildcats’ contest against Duquesne at 7:30 p.m., on Tuesday, Jan. 24, in the John Belk Arena. \nCurry, who will be in town for the Jan. 25 Warriors v. Hornets game, plans to attend the Section 30 dedication. \nCurry averaged 28.6 points per game during his junior season and is Davidson’s all-time leading scorer. Section 30 promises to be rocking on Jan. 24. Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:41:14.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
