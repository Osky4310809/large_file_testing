Ukraine blamed the killing on Russia, linking it to testimony by Voronenkov against Viktor Yanukovych, the Kremlin-backed Ukrainian leader who was ousted three years ago in street protests.\nThe assassination carries the “obvious signature of Russian special services,” President Petro Poroshenko, said via Facebook. “Voronenkov was a key witness of Russian aggression against Ukraine.”\nAlready at their worst since the Soviet Union collapsed, the murder further shatters ties between the two countries. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Black Sea region of Crimea in 2014 and the government in Kiev blames Putin for instigating the three-year insurgency on the nations’ shared border. \nYanukovych, who now lives in Russia, stands accused of treason for inviting Russian troops into Ukraine, allegations he denies.\n“Voronenkov was one of the key witnesses against Yanukovych,” said Larysa Sargan, spokeswoman for Ukraine’s Prosecutor General. “It was a demonstrative execution of a witness.”\nSERGEI SUPINSKY/AFP/Getty Images Policemen hold Maria Maksakova, wife of Denis Voronenkov, as she reacts near his body on March 23, 2017. Voronenkov left for Ukraine in 2016 after his failure to win re-election annulled his parliamentary immunity and exposed him to criminal charges over a building dispute. He’d campaigned for the Communist Party against foreign ownership of local media and Russian companies’ offshore structures. \nHe was joined in Kiev by his wife, an opera singer and ex-legislator for Putin’s party. They received Ukrainian citizenship last month.\n“Americans should realize that Putin and his guys are convinced that he spins the planet with his feet,” like a soccer ball, he said in an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast last month. \n“The FSB cyberforces are quite powerful globally. Now, they do not just listen to you — they listened and recorded all my phone calls for eight years. They also attack other states.”\nAP Photo/Sergei Chuzavkov Forensic experts and police officers work at the scene following the killing of Denis Voronenkov in Kiev, Ukraine, Thursday, March 23, 2017. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed as absurd suggestions that Russia was involved in the killing, the Interfax news service reported. He said the killing showed Ukraine was unable to ensure Voronenkov’s safety.\nEx-Russian opposition lawmaker Ilya Ponomarev said on Facebook that Voronenkov had been on his way to meet him when he was shot. \n“Voronenkov isn’t a crook — he’s an investigator of mortal danger to Russia’s security services,” he said.\nThe murder is the latest in a string of fatal attacks in Kiev. Most recently, a Belarusian journalist who made his career in Russia was assassinated in a car bomb last summer. The perpetrators remain at large.\nPoroshenko also accused Russia of involvement in a fire Thursday at a Ukrainian arms depot that required the evacuation of almost 20,000 residents.\nAP Photo/Sergei Chuzavkov Forensic experts and police officers examine the scene following the killing of Denis Voronenkov in Kiev, Ukraine, Thursday, March 23, 2017.
