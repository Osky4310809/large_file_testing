Tesco’s going off. The old people are loving it.’\nA woman with him can be heard saying: ‘Jesus! Oh my god! All we wanted was some sausages.’\nOne of the men who took part in the frenzy emerged with lots of grapes. He said: ‘Think of the money you save. We save fortunes. It’s the Koreans that are the worse ones.’\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T14:41:46.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
