Williamson did not reveal her son’s age. \n“We were treated like dogs because I requested they attempt to screen him in other ways per TSA rules,” wrote Williamson on Facebook. “He has SPD and I didn’t want my child given a pat down like this.” \n…I’ll spare you a Google: \nSensory Processing Disorder or SPD (originally called Sensory Integration Dysfunction) is a neurological disorder in which the sensory information that the individual perceives results in abnormal responses. those with Sensory Processing Disorder do detect sensory information; however, the sensory information gets “mixed up” in their brain and therefore the responses are inappropriate in the context in which they find themselves. \nSo yeah I’m going to say that any situation where you’re giving a kid the full “Jared from Subway before he gives out free footlong punch cards at an elementary school assembly” frisking is suboptimal whether the kid had some sensory disorder or not. But obviously any time a kid has a disorder like that, this is a billion times worse. No kid should have to get his body thoroughly investigated for minutes that thoroughly; that’s not some radicalized child bomber with layers of questionable attire, it’s a kid in some shorts and a t-shirt looking kind of terrified as this guy goes to town searching every nook and cranny of him. That gave me shivers down my spine. If feel like we all should get a settlement for having to watch that go down, this poor little dude deserves a full run to college and his own airliner after that Lou Perelman casting for the Nsync experience. \nThe TSA of course took up for ol’ Uncle Grabby Hands: \nWilliamson says Aaron “set off NO alarms” and “physically did not alarm at all during screening.” She also claims the TSA detained Aaron for “well over an hour” to conduct the screening process, which caused the family to miss their flight. \n“In total, the pat-down took approximately two minutes, and was observed by the mother and two police officers who were called to mitigate the concerns of the mother,” the TSA statement reads. “The passengers were at the checkpoint for approximately 45 minutes, which included the time it took to discuss screening procedures with the mother and to screen three carry-on items that required further inspection.” \nClassic TSA. I appreciate their efforts at keeping us safe and all that but to act like the gigantic overreach of meticulously frisking a kid thanks to an alarm on a laptop is for our own safety is exhibit A of why they need to get their shit in order. And that’s ignoring the fact that this “body search” more closely resembled a guy trying to seduce a girl in some massage porn video. Maybe spend less time detaining families because you’re all worked up about little dudes packing dynamite in their Spider-Man underoos and spend more time doing just about anything else.
