Snopes, looking at the evidence , called it “unproven.” \nThere is a reason that members of the LGBTQ+ community — among other minority groups — were defiantly fearful of a President Trump. \nThis is the reason. \nWe argued that his divisive, anti-American rhetoric would embolden people who wanted to commit hate crimes and violence against people who were different from them. \nIt has. \nBhaveek N. Makan reported on Twitter about his friend Chris Ball who was attacked for being gay, not long after the annoucement of Donald J. Trump as our next President. Woke up to hear my great friend was physically attacked last night for being gay. \"We have a new president faggot\" he was told. I'm hurt. pic.twitter.com/bDJjHl2dyT \n— Bhaveek N. Makan (@TehBhav) November 9, 2016 \nA little more context to the story and what exactly happened: via Twitter \nThe story was also posted by Chris’ friend, K.C. MacPherson: \nAccording to these reports, Chris was on a date with a guy when a total stranger noticed. This stranger assaulted Chris, saying that, “We have a new President, faggot!” \nSome conservatives tried to dismiss this as some kind of hoax, but there is also a Facebook post from Avery Kentis, who accompanied Chris to the emergency room. Facebook \nAnd posts from Chris himself on Facebook: \nConservatives are professional deniers, of course, so many still insist the attack was a hoax and that President Trump will be “great for the gays.” Then there is this guy who believes hate crimes are hoaxes, cus \"this doesn't feed into my views.\" pic.twitter.com/BW44alsMRM \n— Bhaveek N. Makan (@TehBhav) November 10, 2016 \nThe worst may be happening. All we can do is buckle up, batten down the hatches, and look out for each other. As Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” \nChris is expected to make a full recovery: \n— Bhaveek N. Makan (@TehBhav) November 9, 2016 \nWe will resist this, and love will endure. Best wishes of recovery and happiness to Chris.
