The video continues for nearly four minutes, with both women arguing, yelling obscenities and making death threats toward each other.\nPayne said he and his wife had just sat down and ordered their food just before the fight began. There were about 10 to 12 customers there at the time, Payne said.\n“We could sense the tension in the air when we walked in,” he said.\nLeading up to the fight, Payne said he saw one of the women walk over to the other, who was standing in front of the dishwasher, and ask her to move. That’s when the women began to argue and then the fight broke out.\nPayne said he immediately pulled out his phone and started recording. He added that he was going to stop the fight, but stayed out of it once his wife pointed out that the women could have knives.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Fox News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T08:16:42.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
