Sydney Roosters recruits Michael Gordon and Luke Keary. Picture: Gregg Porteous Source: News Corp Australia \nGordon is tipped to take over the custodian role where the likes of Mitchell and Ferguson played last season without great success. \nMitchell struggled at times in the No. 1 jumper, but there’s no denying his talent. If he made the move to the centres, he could be incredibly dangerous with some early ball, a la Greg Inglis. \nFerguson is coming off a stellar Four Nations campaign with the Australian side, where he played out wide, and will be the all the better for the experience. \nThat leaves New Zealand international Kenny-Dowall and former NSW Origin representative Daniel Tupou to likely take the final two spots, but that doesn’t mean there’s no competition for them either. \nOver the next month, foxsports.com.au will be previewing your team’s best 17. \nAs always, there will be some contentious decisions — and some unlucky omissions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:06:02.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
