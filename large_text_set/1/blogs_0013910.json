In most cases, it’s more sensationalized, dramatized and a ton of explosions and sex are added. Other times, however, great care is taken to ensure that a story based on true events, is represented accurately and truthfully. \nThese films are some of the best and most compelling cinematic features based on true events. Check them out. 2 \nAlive (1993) A football team from Uruguay survives a plane crash in the Andes Mountains with little food, requiring them to resort to drastic measures to survive. Starring a young Ethan Hawke, it tells a brutal story of survival and perseverance and the fact that it’s based on real events, makes it that much more startling and absorbing. 3 \nAll the President’s Men (1976) The oldest film on this list, but still one hell of a powerful one. It’s the story of 2 Washington Post reporters that blew open the Watergate scandal that took down president Richard Nixon. It’s gripping, brilliantly acted and an incredibly moving film. 4 \nAmistad (1997) In 1839 a group of slaves overtook their transport ship, killing the crew and ending up in the north, where slavery is outlawed. They’re arrested and suddenly the questions of property, murder and freedom are intertwined in a trial that captures the nation’s attention on the eve of the Civil War. It’s a true film about rights and freedoms and it’s one you should really watch. 5 \nBlack Hawk Down (2001) Based on the US involvement in Somalia in 1993, over 100 US Army Rangers went into the city of Mogadishu to capture high profile targets, only to find they were being targeting themselves. With a lot of great talent showcased here before they got big, it’s an ensemble piece that feels so intimate and heroic. Advertisement 6 \nBridge of Spies (2015) Tom Hanks plays a lawyer who’s tasked in defending a Russian Spy, and becomes embroiled in the world of spy trading and prisoner exchanges in Cold War Berlin as the wall went up. This is an engaging and complex film, and Tom Hanks is fantastic as always. 7 \nCatch Me If You Can (2002) Based on the autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr. who was a master counterfeiter and con artist, this film is a surprisingly light and entertaining film, all due to DiCaprio’s performance. Also, when the real Frank Abagnale Jr. cameos in the film and give it his thumbs up, you know it’s accurate. 8 \nCitizen X (1995) This was a made-for-TV movie, but it doesn’t make it any less powerful. This follows the story of an inspector in the Soviet Union who was trying to track down the first major known serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo. With Donald Sutherland, Jeffrey DeMunn and Max Von Sydow, it’s quite the surprise for a non-theatrical film. Based on Robert Cullen’s non-fiction book The Killer Department, it’s a suspenseful watch. 9 \nCompliance (2012) When a prank caller pretending to be a police officer calls a fast food joint to request that a particular employee be detained for stealing, his prank escalates into a humiliating strip search and invasion of privacy; all for a joke. Based on an actual series of prank call crimes back in 2004, this is a brutal and tough film to watch, but psychologically compelling. 10 \nApollo 13 (1995) Based on the absolutely ferrying account of the Apollo 13 crew, who were trapped in space on their way to the moon. The way that mission control and the 3 astronauts worked together to find a way home is so inspirational, and the performances are superb. This is an insanely re-watchable film. Advertisement 11 \nDonnie Brasco (1997) When an FBI agent goes deep undercover in the mafia in NY, he has to befriend violent criminals and finds himself questioning his abilities. This is rated as one of the best mafia movies out there, with an accurate depiction of the true events from history. 12 \nFrost/Nixon (2008) After the Watergate Scandal, getting an interview with former president Richard Nixon was tough. But British talk show host David Frost was able to get an audience and conduct an in-depth interview with him. What really happened in the Watergate hotel is always going to be a mystery, but this film, based off of the play by the same name, gets very close to telling the truth of that story. 13 \nHotel Rwanda (2004) This is an incredible story of a simple hotel manager who saved over 1,000 refugees from slaughter during the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, and claimed the lives of over 500,000 people. The subject matter is rough, but Don Cheadle’s performance is breathtaking, and really humanizes the reality of those events. 14 \nLean On Me (1989) You can’t go wrong with a film starring Morgan Freeman. In ‘Lean On Me,’ he plays a new principal who’s brought into a very troubled school to turn it around. Based the story of Joe lois Clark, a real life inner city principal in New Jersey, show’s a man who’s tough on his teachers and hist students alike to get the very best out of them. If you’re looking for inspirational and heartwarming, this is the film to watch. 15 \nLord of War (2005) This film is less based on one specific person, but the lead character is an amalgamation of various arms dealers during the 80’s when the Cold War was on. It highlights how easy it was to become an arms dealer and how lucrative and addicting it could be facilitate war for profit. It’s a terrific film. Advertisement 16 \nMunich (2005) This film tells the story of the aftermath of the killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic games, and how the men responsible were found and brought to justice. Based on the memoirs of a Mossad agent, this is a brutal film of vengeance and morality. 17 \nElephant (2003) This film tells the story of a few kids who are going about their daily lives while in high school, contrasted with 2 other kids that are preparing to make that day the worst. It’s loosely based on the Columbine massacre, and is a pretty accurate depiction of the events of that day. What makes this film especially powerful is that most of the performers are non actors, using their real names, which makes this more of a look into a real series of events, rather than a dramatized reenactment. 18 \nSleepers (1996) Four kids from the Bronx are sentenced to a juvenile detention centre and suffer heavy abuse from the officers. When they get out and grow up, they plot of their revenge. The writer of the novel the film is based on, wrote from personal experience of his time in Juvie in his youth. This is a brilliant film with an all-star cast including Jason Patric, Brad Pitt and Kevin Bacon. 19 \nSpotlight (2015) This tells the story of how the Boston Globe uncovered stories of child molestation within the Catholic Church and the coverups that plagued the Archdiocese. It won best picture and with amazing performances from Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and John Slattery, it’s not hard to see why. It’s easily one of the best films of the past 10 years and one shouldn’t miss. 20 \nDefiance (2008) When 3 brothers in Belarus start to hide and protect escaped Jews, by sheltering them in the forest. Based on a novel outlining the escapades of the Bielski Partisans, it’s a gripping film about family, brothers and doing what’s right at any cost. This one was incredibly moving. Advertisement 21 \nThe Grey Zone (2001) This film tells the story of the only uprising at the Auschwitz death camp, but the Sonderkommandos, who were the selected Jews to clean up and dispose of the those exterminated at the camp. Most Holocaust films are absolutely brutal (Schindlers List, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and Son of Saul are some of the most devastating films I’ve seen), and this one is right up there in terms of depicting the horror and absolute nihilism and evil that the holocaust caused. 22 \nThe Last King of Scotland (2006) Based on the dictator Idi Amin as he ruled Uganda with a ruthless fist in the 1970’s, it’s a story told by his Scottish personal physician of the dictators’ rise and fall. The performances in this film were just fantastic. 23 \nThe Impossible (2012) This film follows a family of tourists caught in Thailand during the devastating 2004 Tsunami. It’s an emotional ride to see the family together, then torn apart by a natural and devastating disaster, and to watch them try to find one another again. I can’t imagine surviving something like this, but the fact that the mother in the film, Maria Belon (played by Naomi Watts), actually survived the Tsunami with her family, nearly dying in the process. It’s her story that is used accurately for this film. 24 \nValkyrie (2008) I’d generally suspect that anything that has Tom Cruise in the lead role is not going to be very accurate, but this film surprised me. This is the story of the men who tried to kill Hitler and take over Nazi Germany to steer it away from it’s dangerous path. With Cruise actually making himself look as close to his real-life counterpart Colonel Stauffenberg, as possible. It’s a tense film and the fact that it’s based on historic accounts, makes you wonder what the world would have been like if Hitler was stopped sooner. 25 \nTyson (1995) There’s been a couple of films about Mike Tyson, and a lot of biographical film about legendary boxers (Ali, for example is a fantastic film, but most critics found that Will Smith lacked the charisma the real Ali had). This wasn’t a widely known biopic, but Micheal Jai White does a fantastic job of capturing the spirit of Tyson from his early days as a dynamo boxer to his incarceration for rape in 1991. What makes this film such a great true story, is that it’s so surprising how well made it is. If you’re a fan of character pieces, you should watch this one. Advertisement 26 \nUnited 93 (2006) It’s an incredibly sensitive and delicate topic, but this Paul Greengrass film uses available information from surviving family members, cockpit recorders and other sources, as well as a healthy amount of imagination to present the terrorist takeover and heroic actions of the passengers of United Flight 93. This is a tough film to watch, as when it gets too intense, you can’t just say ‘it’s just a movie.’ It’s not; it really happened. 27 \nZodiac (2007) This film has gotten a lot of flack for being long, solemn and not having a resolution, but that’s the appeal of the film. They never caught the Zodiac Killer; never even got close. With Robert Downey Jr. as the reporter and JakeG Gyllenhaal as the amateur artist who becomes obsessed with the Zodiac, it’s a deftly plotted and well acted film. It definitely deserves a re-watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:05:21.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
