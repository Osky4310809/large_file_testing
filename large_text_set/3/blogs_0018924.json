A terrible thing — fuck terrorism. Many people were sending Ts & Ps the English capital’s way and 99.99% of them did it without pushing their personal beliefs. \nLaurie here was not part of the 99.99 percent. She just HAD to push her “god isn’t real” agenda. This guy nails it. \n\n\nDead serious, the most preposterous Ts & Ps effort I’ve ever seen. Basically anything other than what she said would suffice. “Thoughts with” or “pulling for” or “thinking of” or any other combination of words in the English language. But “thoughts and atheist prayers”? Da fuk? \nI googled atheist prayers because it was such an absurd phrase; this bullshit is the first result. \n\n\nSome dude lost and confused because he used to be a Christian but decided he doesn’t believe in god so now he’s not sure who to pray to. News flash buddy you don’t pray to anyone. You’re just a walking talking breathing pile of dust and gas that’s going to come and go with no higher meaning. Your beliefs not mine (but also mine). \nAtheist prayers? This chick knew EXACTLY what she was doing. Look at her trying to deflect. \n\n\nNo one’s yelling they’re just pointing out how absurd it was to slip your atheism into a simple Ts & Ps effort. Atheist prayers aren’t even a thing so you sending them to Westminster is you obviously and inappropriately interjecting your personal beliefs for no reason. Psycho move.
