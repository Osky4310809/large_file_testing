About 20,000 Pittsburgh households have lead service lines delivering water into their homes and between 20 and 30 percent of those lines are suspected of leaching high levels of lead. \nThat means people in up to 6,000 homes or apartment houses are drinking water with dangerous lead levels. \nYet to date, there is no call to action — no definitive plan to ensure safe drinking water. \nSheehan: Isn’t that a health emergency? PWSA Chairman Alex Thomson: It is. It is. It absolutely is. \nCity council has a proposal to provide water pitcher filters to families with kids and the authority is looking at providing tap filters to any family who wants one. \n“Something we’re looking at. Something we want to roll out as quickly as possible. Especially to people of a socioeconomic basis that can’t handle it themselves,” said Thomson. \nBut water filters are only a stop gap. The real solution is replacing those lead service lines, but the replacement of those lines is moving at a snail’s pace. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \nIt’s expensive and a bureaucratic headache for anyone who wants to replace theirs. \nIf you test high for lead in your water you call PWSA and they will place the lead service line only to the edge of your property. You then have to have a plumber to replace the portion of line to your house. \nThe process is expensive, can cost you several thousands of dollars, and is slow. \nSheehan: That’s a terribly inefficient way of doing things. Thompson: Absolutely. Absolutely and you know what the problem is? You know what the problem is Andy ? The law has to be changed. \nState law says public employees can’t work on private property, so you’re on the hook. PWSA wants an exception to the law so it can do the whole job. \nThe authority is also looking into a residential assistance program to help reduce the cost. \nBut like the water filters, these are still only proposals — and critics say the city and the PWSA is dragging its feet in dealing with a public health crisis. \n“There is no urgency whatsoever and or even a recognition of the problem that we have,” Wagner said. \nPWSA is boring holes in the ground throughout residential neighborhoods and using fiber-optic cameras to painstakingly identify and map location of each lead service line in the city — a process that is expected to take six years. \nThe authority is also under orders to replacement them over the next 12 years, but that’s way too slow according to county controller Chelsa Wagner, who’s calling for a citywide blitz and on government to pay for it. \n“If we have the funding that we can put to development projects and all of those sorts of things and we’re not going to preserve the most fundamental resource that we have which is water,” said Wagner. \nSaid Thomson: “We fully acknowledge there is a crisis. It’s a public health crisis. We have to address it. We have to address it in the right way.” Andy Sheehan facebook Follow KDKA-TV Investigator Andy Sheehan began his broadcast journalism career in September 1992, when he joined KDKA-TV after reporting for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette for nine years.
