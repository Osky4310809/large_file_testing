HTC reportedly announced the news during its earnings call conference earlier this week. \nHTC said that it will continue to sell and support entry-level devices that are already in its inventory. However, the brand will reduce the total number of new phones to six or seven in 2017. The brand cited the high level of competition in the entry-level segment as one reason for dropping budget devices from its portfolio. HTC will now only produce mid-range and flagship smartphones, like the recently announced U Play and U Ultra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T09:45:35.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
