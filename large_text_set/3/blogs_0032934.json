Salford are the real deal in 2017 \nIf we didn’t already know that from recent wins over Castleford, Warrington and Widnes then we do now. Ian Watson has his side playing a tough, attractive style of rugby - and has each member of the team buying into his ethos. But for a controversial Leeds try in a narrow defeat at Headingley and a last-gasp loss at Wakefield, their position could have been even stronger. Genuine top four contenders on the evidence so far.

Michael Dobson is playing some of the best rugby of his career \nSalford coach Watson had praised Dobson’s form and game management ahead of this match - and the experienced Australian again produced the goods. Not normally known for his try scoring, his two tries both displayed a willingness to push up and support the play. Put that alongside his organising and kicking skills, and Salford have one of the competition’s in-form players at present. Craig Kopczak scores a try (Photo: Simon Wilkinson - simon@swpix.co) 3. Saints’ half-back injury woes continue \nJust a week after finally getting key man Matty Smith back from a broken leg, Saints lost his half-back partner Theo Fages in the opening stages to concussion. It meant two reshuffles within the game, with first Jon Wilkin and then Jonny Lomax moving to stand-off. There were other reasons for Saints’ defeat, but the disruption this causes should not be underestimated. “It really hurt us,” coach Keiron Cunningham admitted.

Salford pack fears nobody \nSt Helens arrived at the AJ Bell Stadium with a pack in improving form and four props with fearsome reputations. But the likes of Kopczak, Lee Mossop and Mark Flanagan stood up to their opponents and again set a platform for the Red Devils backs. Unsung heroes George Griffin and Adam Walne also deserve mention for their unstinting efforts. Salford Red Devils' Mark Flanagan tackles St Helens' James Roby (Photo: PA) 5. Video refereeing referrals aren’t the be-all and end-all \nIn a week when video technology sprang to the fore in football, it was a rare night off in Super League, where referee James Child didn’t refer one decision to Ben Thaler. The initiative still splits supporters 21 years after it was first used for the opening Super League game between Paris and Sheffield. Some believe it still has a key part to play with others feeling it has run its course and disrupts the flow and continuity of matches.
