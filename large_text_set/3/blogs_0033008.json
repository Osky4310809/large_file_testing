When Spicer, with a straight face, claimed Trump prioritized women's empowerment during the campaign, why didn't a reporter confront him? — Peter Daou (@peterdaou) March 29, 2017 \nIn fact, as analysis from Bloomberg shows , Trump has hired one woman for every three men in his White House staff. \nSpicer also quoted US First Lady Melania Trump, who spoke at a Women’s History Month event earlier that day. \n“The President believes - as the First Lady said this morning - quote ‘Wherever women are diminished, the entire world is diminished’.” \"and then spicer said, they're investing in women's health \" pic.twitter.com/tOOko0Hgq0 — Jessica Samakow (@jsam1126) March 29, 2017 Trump says he wants to empower our daughters. He barged into Teen USA dressing rooms& joked abt dating his daughter. https://t.co/qLQ0oNNx8C", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T13:16:13.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
