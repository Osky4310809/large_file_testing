The US Post Office is set to raise the price of its Forever Stamps from $0.47 to $0.49, so it’s a good time to get yours while you can. Advertisement \nForever stamps are a special kind of stamp that the Post Office issues that retain their value even if the price of stamps goes up. In other words, a $0.47 stamp today will still cover the cost of a $0.49 postage cost next month. Even if the price of postage goes up years from now, Forever stamps will still cover the cost of whatever one stamp is worth. If you frequently mail letters, or if you just want to make sure you’re covered for the foreseeable future, now’s a good time to grab a book and save yourself a few coins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T14:36:51.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
