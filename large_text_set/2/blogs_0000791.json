Each celebrity contestant gets not just a signing amount (in lakhs), but also gets paid for every week that they survive inside the house. \nThis time, with commoners (or Indiawale ) being a part of the house, the contestants were a mix of unknown faces and celebrities. What was quite unfair was the huge difference in the amounts being paid. \nIndiawale managed to steal the show from day one, with Manveer Gurjar emerging as the winner. However none of them were paid a signing amount and they received Rs. 25,000 for every week that they stayed in the house. When compared to the six-figure money the celebrities were making this seems quite unfair. \nNow that Manveer has won, we hope this changes next season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T13:48:59.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
