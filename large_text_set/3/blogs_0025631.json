After watching the Wild stagger aimlessly through a hellacious month of hockey with things only looking worse, many in the crowd of 19,184 Saturday afternoon let players have it by firing missiles in the sound of boos after a humiliating second period during an eventual 4-2 loss to one of the worst teams in the NHL. There was a reason Bruce Boudreau’s face was the color of his team’s Iron Range Red jerseys during a mind-bogglingly weak second period against the Vancouver Canucks, who had won once in the previous eight games and six times in 23 since the All-Star break. A scoreless tie after one became a 4-0 deficit when the Wild allowed four second-period goals to match a team record for most goals allowed in a period. The result was the Wild’s 10th loss in 13 games in March, although the team will still clinch a fifth consecutive playoff berth if the Rangers beat the Kings in regulation Saturday night. Ryan Suter and Eric Staal scored 86 seconds apart in the final 2:41 of the game to make the margin of defeat look more palatable. Things got so bad, Darcy Kuemper, making his first start since March 10 and pulled in his previous two starts, received a mocking Bronx cheer after he saved a weak shot by Jack Skille 40 seconds after Skille scored Vancouver’s fourth goal on eight shots in the period. Reid Boucher scored the first two, the first coming 19 seconds into the period after Suter took a slashing penalty and Mikko Koivu’s clearing attempt was blocked coming out of the zone. In Thursday’s loss to Philadelphia, the Flyers scored the winning goal 21 seconds into the second. Then, things became worse when Burnsville native Brock Boeser made it 3-0 with his first NHL goal right in front of his entire family filling the main concourse level Suite 66. Hours before, Boeser was part of the University of North Dakota’s loss to Boston University. But he signed after the game and the deal was announced 2 ½ hours before his NHL debut. Boeser, 20, scored in a rebound after Kuemper denied Bo Horvat for what would become the game-winning goal. Defenseman Marco Scandella started the whole mess when his shot broke Sven Baertschi’s stick. Scandella pinched up to try to get the puck, but Baertschi kicked the puck out to Boeser, who triggered a breakaway to Horvat. Kuemper made a solid save, but he couldn’t hold onto the puck and Boeser scored when Scandella didn’t stick with him and peeled off. Skille, who later left the game with a serious-looking ankle injury after being checked by Charlie Coyle, then made it 4-0. Offensively, the Wild showed signs of a fragile, snakebit team that is fighting things right now despite facing a goalie that had played two prior NHL games this season. Against Richard Bachman, Wild players couldn’t execute even getting shots off on one-timers (Koivu, Zach Parise and Martin Hanzal), players overskated rebounds (Coyle, Staal and Parise), players shattered sticks trying to get shots off (Nino Niederreiter). You knew it was bad when even smooth-handed leading scorer Mikael Granlund was playing the puck like a grenade. The Wild lost for the ninth time in 11 games against a team that was 1-5-2 in its past eight and 6-14-3 in its past 23. The Wild entered the game with March rankings of 26th with 2.25 goals per game, tied for 21st with 3.00 goals allowed per game, 27th with an .893 save percentage and 23rd with a .139 power-play percentage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:06:00.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
