The leaked renders suggested that the LG G6 would be lacking the modular design seen on its predecessor. Now a new official-looking render of the phone has also surfaced on the interwebs. \nCorroborating the earlier reports , the newly leaked image suggests that the LG G6 will sport narrow bezels on top and sides. The photo only shows the top half of the phone. It appears that the device will feature curved corners, and it will be made out of glass and metal. The volume rocker of the device is visible on the left side. The source claims that the LG G6 will come with a 3.5mm headphone jack, a waterproof design and a non-removable battery. \nThe report further suggests that the LG G6 will feature a large 5.7-inch display with an unusual aspect ratio of 2 : 1. Its screen-to-body ratio will be greater than 90 percent. The device will feature a dual camera setup on the back and a center-mounted fingerprint sensor. The phone is expected to be unveiled at the brand’s event on February 26th at MWC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T13:41:14.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
