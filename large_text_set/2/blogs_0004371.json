Quite the opposite actually, as his short temper has eviscerated relationships with everyone from Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to Meryl Streep. To make things worse, Trump is now starting to lose people who were previously on his side. First on the list is Kanye West, who has pulled a 180 in his support of the president and has erased all of his previous pro-Trump tweets. \nThough engendering a wealth of public support following his calamitous breakdown at the tail end of last year, Kanye’s surprise (and mysterious) meeting with the then president-elect at Trump Tower was met with shock and outrage. At the fateful last stop of his “Saint Pablo” Tour West spoke glowingly of Trump, and his subsequent meeting was spent discussing “multicultural issues” important to West.\nBut after a tumultuous start to the presidency, West has revoked his former praise and deleted all former mention of Trump from his Twitter. TMZ reported that Kanye was extremely dissatisfied with Trump’s controversial “Muslim ban” and can no longer support his agenda. Seems like Kanye’s 2020 presidential bid is looking a whole lot more likely. \nRevisit the video for Kanye’s The Life of Pablo track “Fade” below.\n\nIn other (far less political) music news, Chance the Rapper has shared a music video for his Coloring Book single “Same Drugs” starring a cast of puppets.
