The full receipt Credit: Facebook \nS he wrote: “So it appears if you go to Fat’s in Folsom and a RAT runs around your feet, there is no real protocol. So keep that in mind if you choose to visit this establishment. \n“No manager … just ‘SEEN RAT’ on you bill. With a DISCOUNT!! That’s nice. I’m sorry, but does anyone else see a problem with this? \n“If a rat joins you at dinner at a very well known family of restaurants in the area …. At minimum a manager should visit your table and ‘comp’ my meal.” \nK evin Fat, the COO of the restaurant group, told KXTL: “In our 14 years in Folsom, we have not experienced something like this before. \n“The manager put in verbatim what the guest saw or stated, that’s not normal practice.” \nA Sacramento County Environmental Management Department inspector said there was no evidence of rats at the restaurant. \n“For example there were no droppings; there were no live or dead bodies, no nesting, no gnawed food packages,” an inspector told KXTL. \n“I think with the weather, it’s possible that one came in, maybe the back door, and maybe wandered around the dining room and was chased back out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T12:39:19.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
