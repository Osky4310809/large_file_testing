John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Thursday that he spoke to the Australian ambassador to express support for the nations' relationship after a heated call from President Trump.\n\"I called Australia’s Ambassador to the United States this morning to express my unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance,\" McCain, who's frequently criticized Trump, said in a statement.\nMcCain added that he asked Joe Hockey, the Australian ambassador to the U.S., to \"convey to the people of Australia\" that Americans value their alliance, \"honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.”\nThe Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Trump lashed out at Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during a call last Saturday.\nWell, bully for the Washington Post . The rest of the lickspittle media immediately jumped on the story -- citing anonymous \"sources,\" of course -- and used it as a club with which to beat the president. A \"heated exchange\" and an \"insult,\" leading to a \"hang up\" and therefore to a \"rift.\" The MSM was unanimous -- another disaster for Trump and another black eye for America.\nNever mind that Turnbull almost immediately deflected the substance of the Post 's report , which was a based on a partially linked transcript provided by someone holding a position in the Permanent Government, who needs to be rooted out, exposed and fired. Or that heads or state are supposed to speak to each other bluntly. Or that America voted precisely for such an attitude in its new president.\nThe Australian prime minister declined to comment on reports that President Trump had hung up on him after a testy exchange over a refugee program. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told reporters in his country on Thursday that Australia’s relationship with the U.S. remained “very strong” and that the refugee deal, signed with the Obama administration, remained intact.\nThe Washington Post had reported that Mr. Trump lost his cool when discussing the deal, which requires that the U.S. resettle refugees from among more than 1,500 asylum seekers being held on small Pacific islands. According to the Post, Mr. Trump called the pact “the worst deal ever” and accused Australia of exporting the “next Boston bombers.” But Mr. Turnbull denied that, saying that “the president assured me he would follow through” on the deal.\nA couple of observations. First, Trump is right to question the deal, having made his position on further Muslim \"immigration\" perfectly clear during the campaign and his first two weeks in office; it's not America's job to bail Australia (which has its own signification Muslim problem) out of its troubles.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/02/john-mccain-meddling-busybody/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://thehill.com/people/john-mccain", "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/1/malcolm-turnbull-denies-trump-canceled-refugee-dea/", "http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trump/", "http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/317536-mccain-calls-australian-ambassador-to-express-support-after-trump-incident"], "published": "2017-02-02T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:06:04.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
