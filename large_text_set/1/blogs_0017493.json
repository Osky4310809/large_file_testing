We object to the proposal and would urge EE and BT Group to think again.\" \nMountaineering Scotland chief executive David Gibson added: \"Glen Etive is an iconic, beautiful glen within a National Scenic Area: one which offers visitors a fantastic experience of the true wild nature of Scotland's mountains. \n\"The mast and infrastructure would render some views utterly ordinary.\" \nIn a statement issued by EE it said: \"Providing mobile coverage in Glen Etive is critical for search and rescue, the new Emergency Services Network and visitors to the area, and we welcome the feedback from Mountaineering Scotland and other parties as we develop our plans for providing mobile coverage in the area.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T13:00:26.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
