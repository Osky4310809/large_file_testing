An OFW for seven years, Castro sets off to work from 4 a.m. to 4 p.m. six days a week. \nShe is a licensed limo driver for the Road and Transport Authority (RTA) and drives a Land Cruiser starting from her home in Dubai’s Satwa district. Despite being a neophyte in the driving industry, she manages to pick up seven to eight passengers a day. ADVERTISEMENT \n“I hope this will encourage more of my female colleagues to join,” Castro told the news site. \nCastro, a mother of three, previously worked for the Emirates Transport and the Duin Luxury Cars, where she stayed for seven months. While doing the rounds in hotels at her previous job, she heard about Uber when several guests requested for the app’s service.
