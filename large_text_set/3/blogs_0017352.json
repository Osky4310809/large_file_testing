The Former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Palmer, former New South Wales director of public prosecutions Nicholas Cowdery, retired NSW Supreme court judge Hal Sperling, and 14 other experts have voiced their concerns about Australia's \"tough on drugs\" approach, claiming Australian should follow the lead of 25 other countries that have decriminalised drug use—including Portugal, Germany, France, and 11 states in the US. \n\"We cannot hope to nanny ourselves out of risk,\" writes Palmer, who was head of the Australian Federal Police between 1994 and 2001. \"Laws against drug use and possession are frequently broken by a large proportion of the population.\" Instead the report demands that Australia take a \"Portugal-style\" approach to drug reform by decriminalising possession and use. \nPortugal completely reformed its drug policy back in 2001 and saw significant falls in overdose deaths and HIV infections. Meanwhile in Australia , drug-related deaths and incarceration rates have continued to rise—with more than 80,000 drug arrests each year. \"The solution is to remove the illicit profits by regulating, controlling and taxing drug supply,\" says Nicholas Cowdery, who was the NSW Government's top prosecutor between 1994 and 2011. \nSpeaking to VICE, Palmer said he didn't always hold believe in harm minimisation. \"It was a evolutionary process for me,\" he explained. \"I was the typical young police officer... [who] believed that if you took drugs you got locked up.\" However, around 20 years ago, Palmer's views began to shift. \n\"Some people think: you play the game, you take the knocks ,\" Palmer says. \"But when you're young you don't think like that... you take risks...and most of us are lucky to get away from them.\" For those who don't, the impact of a drug charge on their record can be life changing. And the statistics show young people arrested for drug use and possession make up the biggest proportion of offences in Australia. \nIllustrations by Ashley Goodall \nThe most recent data we have from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission shows current drug policy also affects consumers far more than producers. While there were more than 130,000 drug arrests in Australia in 2014-15 , only around 20,000 were of providers—the rest of the arrests were of consumers. Illicit drug possession and/or use was the most common offence in Australia in 2015-16 . Overwhelmingly, it's young offenders who are caught up in these laws: since 2008, the number of drug offenders between 20-24 years old has jumped nearly 50 percent. \"Consumer arrests are in effect highly discriminatory against those unlucky enough to be caught and criminalised,\" Palmer writes in the report. \nAlready, a number of state and territory government have taken steps towards drug reform. South Australia, the ACT, and the Northern Territory have all decriminalised possession and cultivation of small amounts of cannabis. As the report notes, the change \"has had little or no adverse impact on rates of cannabis use.\" \nCalling for reform, the report outlines 13 key recommendations its panel believes Australia should follow. These included rethinking drug testing for drivers—particularly in the wake of medical cannabis legalisation—noting, \"the purpose of such testing should be to ascertain whether the driver is unsafe or unfit to drive as a result of psychoactive drug use, not to ascertain whether he or she has consumed a psychoactive drug.\" Also floated were the expansion of medically supervised injecting facilities and the introduction of Opioid Substitution Treatment, which would give prisoners access to low cost methadone and buprenorphine during incarceration and after their release. \nPalmer explains that he's frustrated by the lack of action on drug reform, given \"the evidence is almost overwhelming... [and] what we're doing isn't working.\" He admits that \"politicians often share with you privately that they know what needs to be done... but it's often said, 'We don't know how to get re-elected if we do it.'\" \nBut as he says, \"This is not about going soft on drugs, it's about being smarter.\" \nA spokesperson from the AFP said rethinking drug policy was not in the agency's purview. VICE also contacted Attorney-General George Brandis for comment but none was received before publication. \nFollow Maddison on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:31:45.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
