Louis was being kept off school after suffering an allergic reaction at the dentist (Photo: Mercury) \n\"I'm jerking him off because I need to keep an eye on him and give him antihistamine regularly. Hopefully he will be back tomorrow. Thanks.\" \nAngela, 44, from Barrowford, Lancashire, said: \"I've never been so embarrassed. I was rushing around trying to look after him and I'd not checked what was written. \n\"I was absolutely mortified. I wrote it in a hurry and I'm blaming autocorrect and fat thumbs. \n\"By the time I'd realised what I'd done, they'd already replied but didn't acknowledge it. \n\"I didn't read it back before I sent it. Once I spotted the mistake I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. \n\"The teacher replied saying not to worry, it was fine, but she didn't point out the mistake. She was probably just trying to be polite. The embarrassing message (Photo: Mercury Press and Media Ltd) \n\"I could have died. I sent a message back just to explain myself, correct it, and say sorry. Predictive text has a lot to answer for. \n\"I couldn't have written anything worse.\" \nAngela, who has another son, eight-year-old Bailey, soon got another response from the school telling her 'not to worry'.

I think they'd all had a bit of a giggle about it, as did I to be fair. It's easily done. \n\"I've had people asking my why the word 'jerking' was even prompted and I don't really have an answer. \n\"Louis was at the dentist the night before and he has some allergy problems anyway so I think he's just had a bit of a reaction to something.
