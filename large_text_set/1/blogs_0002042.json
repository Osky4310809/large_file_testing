The United States Funded the Creation of ISIS \nThe above YouTube video is 41-minutes long and is a fascinating watch if you have the time. \nBut if you do not, here are some interesting facts pulled from an Arabic interview with Sheikh Nabil Na’eem . Na’eem is an ex- al-Qaeda leader and founder of the Democratic Jihad Party in Cairo, Egypt. \nIn the interview, he claims that ISIS was funded by the U.S. at the price of 20-30 million dollars, trained in Jordan, and armed by the U.S. \nWhy would our government do that? \nThe modern day ISIS was established in 2010, but the group didn’t become a part of common American vernacular until around 2013. 2013 is when the Syrian Civil War came to international attention. \nRedditor M1s4n7hr0p3 claimed in a thread about the topic: \nI was part of a very hush hush operation in 2010 training Jordanian Army regulars and “special forces” how to suck less at life. We were told not to mention it after the fact. Supposedly they were bound for A-stan but I never followed up…. \nThe current leader of ISIS, the enigmatic Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , took over ISIS on May 16, 2010 and rumor has it that he seeded his caliphate dream with a donation of 20-30 million dollars. \nCoincidence? \nNa’eem says that in the U.S.’s quest to overthrow Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad , it began to fund anti-government terrorist groups within Syria way back in 2010 in hopes that the problem would work itself out domestically. \nIt’s the U.S. funding the Taliban to overthrow the Soviets all over again. \nIt’s not a farfetched suggestion. The U.S. has been behind many covert, and not so covert , attempted regime overthrows. It’s just that until recently the consequences of that level of subterfuge hasn’t played out on such an international stage. 2. U.S./U.K./Israel Behind ISIS; ‘Operation Hornet’s Nest’ (Getty) \n“Operation Hornet’s Nest” is the alleged term for creating a destabilized Middle East at the hands of international extremists, aided by the CIA , MI6 , and the Mossad . \nEdward Snowden , famed NSA leaker, claims to have the documents to prove it. In an article in Bahrain’s Gulf News: \nSnowden said intelligence services of three countries created a terrorist organisation that is able to attract all extremists of the world to one place, using a strategy called “the hornet’s nest.” \nFurther leaks provided by Snowden revealed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was provided intensive military training for a whole year by the Mossad. As stated in conspiracy theory one, al-Baghdadi is the current head of ISIS. \nBy attracting international terrorists to the Middle East, the Jewish state would have the demonstrable right to defend itself and wipe out Islamists once and for all, which is beneficial to the West, too. \nFurther theories purport that Saudi Arabia might have a hand in the creation of ISIS too, as they are a Western-backed regime. 3. ISIS Videos are Fake (YouTube) \nThere are many critics of the ISIS beheading videos, claiming that they don’t look real and are created for perpetrating further false flag attacks. Lots of scrutiny surrounded David Cawthorne Haines’ beheading video. \nThese claims are easily dismissed at the graphic reality of the beheading videos, if it weren’t for one thing. According to Infowars: \nA 2010 Washington Post article authored by former Army Intelligence Officer Jeff Stein features a detailed account of how the CIA admittedly filmed a fake Bin Laden video during the run up to the 2003 Iraq war. \nThe article can be read here , an excerpt details the faked Bin Laden video: \nThe agency actually did make a video purporting to show Osama bin Laden and his cronies sitting around a campfire swigging bottles of liquor and savoring their conquests with boys, one of the former CIA officers recalled, chuckling at the memory. The actors were drawn from “some of us darker-skinned employees,” he said. \nIs this is indeed true, what’s to say that current ISIS videos don’t fall under a similar vein? \nIt may sound like moon landing talk , but it’s worth a serious discussion. 4.
