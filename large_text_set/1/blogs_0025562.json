If the people have a card (disclaimer) in the beginning of the film, stating that it is absolutely true to fact... One can take action against that. \n\"But when the card says that this has been inspired by something and not true to (real life) events, then why would anyone raise an objection?\" \nFurther in support of Bhansali, Hrithik said: \"\"With 'Padmavati', how do you know that Mr Bhansali is going to have that card in the starting or not? To just assume and act like this (makes me) absolutely infurious.\" \nLast week, the activists of a Rajput organisation, Karni Sena, entered the Jaigarh Fort and assaulted Bhansali, slapped him and tore up his shirt. \nThey even misbehaved with the crew and criticised the National Award-winning director for \"distorting\" history in the film, which is reportedly about the medieval-era Delhi ruler Alauddin Khilji, who fell in love with Rajput queen Padmavati. \nThey damaged cameras and other equipment, forcing Bhansali to stop shooting. \nThe film stars Shahid Kapoor, Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in leading roles. \nIt's not the first time that such an incident has happened. \nAshutosh Gowariker's \"Jodha Akbar\" too faced flak at the time of release. \nTalking about it, Hrithik said: \"I am not aware of what points people raised against 'Jodhaa Akbar'... But these days, wherever and whenever I go in the world, especially in Morocco and UAE, I am only known as Akbar,\" said Hrithik whose latest film \"Kaabil\" is doing good business at the box office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T09:49:20.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
