Ironically, Miz Miller's resignation announcement was probably the most Abby-like thing as she totally dragged the show for treating her \"like dirt.\"\nRelated: Maddie Ziegler Admits To Being 'Stressed' At 11 \nThe controversial dance teacher posted: \nThe majority of children that follow me may be fast asleep, however now is the critical time to make the following statement: I WILL NO LONGER TAKE PART IN DANCE MOMS. FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS/ SEVEN SEASONS I HAVE ASKED, BEGGED, AND EVEN DEMANDED CREATIVE CREDIT FOR ALL THE IDEAS, AWARD WINNING ROUTINES, THEMES, AND COSTUMING - TO NO AVAIL! TODAY, I WAS SO PROUD THAT I WENT AGAINST THE PRODUCER'S IDEA (ONCE AGAIN) TO ENTER A COMMAND PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE NUMBERS... \"WHERE HAVE ALL THE CHILDREN GONE?\" ALONG WITH THREE BEAUTIFUL SOLOS! I don't have a problem working with any kid, I love children and have dedicated my life to making other people's children successful! I JUST HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BEING MANIPULATED, DISRESPECTED, AND USED - DAY IN AND DAY OUT BY MEN WHO NEVER TOOK A DANCE LESSON IN THEIR LIVES AND TREAT WOMEN LIKE DIRT! #dancemoms #season7 #ALDC #aldcalways #newbeginnings #aldcla #alllovedancecourage A post shared by Abby Lee Miller (@therealabbylee) on Mar 26, 2017 at 9:35pm PDT \nOh snap!! While Lifetime has yet to address Abby's very public resignation, many are left wondering what'll happen to the show that introduced us to dance prodigy Maddie Ziegler .\nStill, it feels as though the 50-year-old's departure from the dance program was inevitable as she's currently in the middle of a bankruptcy fraud case. In case you forgot, in 2015 the choreographer was accused of trying to hide $775K during Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nAllegedly, ALM tried to hide the money in secret bank accounts between 2012 - 2013, in addition to having her friends smuggle $120K in plastic bags in their luggage back in August 2014. In January, the reality TV villain agreed to forfeit the $120K she snuck into Australia.\nAs officials postponed Abby's sentencing date, Miz Ziegler's former mentor has yet to be officially sentenced. We have a feeling things are only going to get more dramatic for the Dance Moms vet.\n[ Image via FayesVision / WENN . ] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:29:13.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
