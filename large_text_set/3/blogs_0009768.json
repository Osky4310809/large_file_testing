Check them out in the players below. \nTransformers: The Last Knight , the fifth entry in the big screen franchise, shatters the core myths of the Transformers franchise, and redefines what it means to be a hero. Humans and Transformers are at war, Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving our future lies buried in the secrets of the past, in the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Saving our world falls upon the shoulders of an unlikely alliance: Cade Yeager ( Mark Wahlberg ); Bumblebee; an English Lord (Sir Anthony Hopkins); and an Oxford Professor ( Laura Haddock ). \nThere comes a moment in everyone’s life when we are called upon to make a difference. In Transformers: The Last Knight , the hunted will become heroes. Heroes will become villains. Only one world will survive: theirs, or ours. \nTransformers: The Last Knight also stars Josh Duhamel as Lieutenant Colonel Lennox, Stanley Tucci as Joshua Joyce, Jerrod Carmichael as Desi, and Isabela Moner as the film’s female lead, Izabella. Liam Carrigan ( Once Upon a Time ) is also set to appear in the film as King Arthur. \nMichael Bay returns to the director’s chair for the film, which is written by Iron Man scribes Art Marcum & Matt Holloway and Ken Nolan ( Black Hawk Down ). Ian Bryce, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Don Murphy and Tom DeSanto are producing the sequel. \nTransformers: The Last Knight will open in theaters on June 23, 2017. Plans for the franchise already include a Bumblebee spin-off film to be released June 8, 2018 and the sixth Transformers movie set to debut June 28, 2019. “We’re covered.” Watch this exclusive new clip from Transformers: The Last Knight now. pic.twitter.com/kYNdwhjG2Z", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T04:55:36.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
