Lift them.\" \nA man in a lab coat stands in the bathtub behind her looking on approvingly, as she holds up her boobs with her hands. \"Don't squeeze them\" (Photo: PrettyPolly/Youtube) \nLater, Holly looks into the camera and dances seductively while touching her bra. \nIt's not the only modelling Holly did in her younger years – she also appeared on the covers of teen magazines after being scouted aged 14. \nHolly revealed back in 2013 that she was spotted by a modelling agent during a school trip to the Clothes Show Live in Birmingham, and quickly made a name for herself in front of the camera. \"Lift them!\" (Photo: PrettyPolly/Youtube) \nThis led to her first presenting job for S Club TV and Ministry Of Mayhem, for which she won a BAFTA in 2006, and she's never looked back since. \nShe later said: \"I appreciate it was down to luck that it happened – modelling is a hard field to break into these days and I'm grateful I never saw the dark side of the industry. It opened a lot of doors for me that I never thought were possible.\" \nBut she has never ruled out doing more modelling in the future, saying after the birth of her daughter Belle in 2011 that she would \"never say never\". Holly pouts seductively and dances in her Pretty Polly bra (Photo: PrettyPolly/Youtube) \n\"When I started as a model I did a lot of lingerie work but it was for Pretty Polly, which is a very safe brand,\" she told the Daily Mail at the time. \n\"It's been less than a year since I had my second baby so I would need some time to get in shape, but I would consider it. Having the time to do all these things is the real problem.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:57:27.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
