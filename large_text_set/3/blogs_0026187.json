Sex Coaches Teach Clients How To Enhance Their Sex Lives   Aries: as long as it leads to sex \nAries do love to fight, as ruled by the warrior planet Mars, but they also seriously enjoy kissing and making up. \nSo while every breakup will end with an absolute resolve to never speak to their ex again, it will almost always be followed by — at the very least — some vengeful sex. Taurus: forgive but never forget \nAs stubborn as they are, Taurus people are often very forgiving. \nOnce they’ve been wronged and decide to finally draw a line in the sand, they will forgive their exes, but they will rarely (if ever) forget. \nThey also are gifted at spotting a phony, so if you’re thinking of making an appeal to get one back, you’d better be truly sorry. What Your Biggest Downfall Will Be This Year Based On Your Zodiac Sign   Gemini: maybe, but not likely \nGeminis are tough to pin down in the first place. So once they’ve let a relationship go for good, there’s about a 40 to 60 percent chance they’ll return to it. \nThey’re very good at seeing all sides of a situation, but this can lead them to being taken advantage of. \nOnce they’ve been wronged, they aren’t as quick to forgive as their friendly disposition might lead you to anticipate. Cancer: absolutely (when can you move back in?) \nCancer really considers their partner a home, someone they can return to, feel safe with and be comforted by. \nWhen a relationship falls apart in a Cancer’s life, you can tell. They appear lost, un-homed and in need of settling down somewhere with someone soon. \nThe moment someone hints at forgiveness, they’ll take them back. Maybe not right away, but they will. Why Micro-Cheating Is Just As Bad As Cheating   Leo: you have to be joking \nHA! Are you insane? \nA Leo will never take back a past lover. The only reason they would leave is because they either never really felt it in the first place, or they were wronged. \nAnd if a Leo is wronged, not only will they not take you back, but they will also make sure no one in the country makes the same mistake they did. Virgo: after everything you’ve put me through? \nVirgo might be willing to forgive a million slights before finally letting someone go, but once they do, the likelihood of repairing the damage is slim to .005 percent. \nNot only that, but they’ll also put all the blame on their ex. \nAnd that, my friends, will hurt. What Your New Year's Resloution Should Be Based On Your Zodiac Sign   Libra: could go either way \nLibra is always willing to understand there is an equal side to every situation, so the chances they’ll take someone back after a long time has passed are about half and half. \nIn fact, since they are such desperate romantics, they’re willing to overlook a lot of things. \nJust don’t give them a reason to hold a grudge. I have a Libra ex who hasn’t spoken to me since high school. Scorpio: probably, yes \nOnce a Scorpio has loved you and left you, you are dead to them. \nBut, there are a few zodiac signs Scorpio has trouble disconnecting with entirely. \nPisces, other Scorpios and Virgos are all signs every Scorpio will be haunted by, regardless of whether or not they want to forget them. \nThe chances for those three signs are a lot higher when it comes to a Scorpio returning to their ex, even if it’s just for the night. Why Opposite Zodiac Signs Attract   Sagittarius: not a chance \nSagittarius might make you think they’ll take you back with their positively upbeat attitude, but the flip side of Sagittarius’ happy-go-lucky disposition is their strict moral standards. \nWhen they stand for something, they stand firmly. Even if they wanted to take someone back, they wouldn’t on principle. Capricorn: reunited and it feels so good \nYes, they’ll be willing to give things a second chance, but there’s a catch. \nCapricorns are like disciplinarians with their partners, so they’ll make sure that before they allow someone back into their lives, that person has learned their lesson. \nSo sure, they’ll 100 percent take you back, but expect to be on probation for a long fucking time. How Your Zodiac Sign Would Handle The Zombie Apocalypse   Aquarius: don’t be stupid \nHonestly, Aquarians are busy. They forgot about you the minute you walked out the door. Pisces: no, but they’ll think about it forever \nPisces are dreamers, so though they generally won’t get back with an ex, they’ll think about it for the rest of their lives. \nThey prefer it that way because actual reality is so much more harsh than the one they make up in their heads. \nSo, there you have it. Now that you’ve armed yourself with the information you need, I bid you all good luck. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:58:32.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
