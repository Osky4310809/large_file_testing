The actress and feminist shared the announcement of her daughter's birth a week and a half ago—which she captioned on Instagram, \"#TheFutureIsFemale \"—and now, only days into motherhood, she's not shying away from disclosing exactly what goes into welcoming a new human into the world either. (Hint: a lot. It takes a lot.) \nOn Saturday, she took to Instagram to post a picture that'll be instantly relatable to many new moms, and she got candid about the messier parts of new motherhood, which still aren't always openly discussed outside of closed circles. In posting the snap, she joined the club of Hollywood moms and social-media-using mamas who are lifting the curtain on unrealistic portrayals of early motherhood and keeping it real. Take, for example, Chrissy Teigen 's openness about the difficulties of trying to get pregnant and her resulting in-vitro fertilization treatments , and her candidness about the \"stretchies\" on her thighs . \nBut back to Tamblyn. Wearing sweatpants, a gray tee that's hanging off her shoulder, and a slight smirk, the actress took a neck-down selfie of the collateral damage of breast leakage—i.e., the patches of milk splattered across her shirt. The picture looks like it was snapped in her bathroom mirror (the ultimate in selfie realness), and we're all about solidarity she's offering. \n\"Who Wore It Better? Left tit or right tit?” she captioned the photo, hashtagging it #MilkLife and #StarsTheyreJustLikeUs!” Loading View on Instagram \nFor those wondering or who haven't experienced this joyous moment post-giving-birth, leaking is common, especially if the infant is young—that's when milk production is especially high and breasts are still finding their groove when it comes to how much to milk to make at one time. According to board-certified lactation consultant Joan Younger Meek, M.D., R.D., who spoke to SELF about breast leakage, it can occur when feeding time is near, during the night when the baby is sleeping a longer stretch than normal, early in the morning when production is high, and even when breastfeeding parents hear, smell, or touch other babies. Whew. The miracle of life! \nHere's to the new-mom sisterhood. Never change, Amber. \nRelated Links:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T03:53:56.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
