Broadnax, who works in digital marketing, got married and divorced. \n“I was hostile to her because she broke my heart,’’ he explains. “I did spy on her a bit through Facebook, though.’’\nBut when a former classmate passed away in 2014, the two reconnected in a Facebook comment thread about their late friend. \nA year later, the New Jersey-based couple were engaged. \n“We talked and started to remember why we fell for each other in the first place,” Broadnax recalls. “Shalonna was there at a pivotal time in my life as a teenager.”\nThanks to social media, more and more people are reuniting with their high-school and college sweethearts. According to a poll conducted in early March by Winq, a polling app that targets millennials, 26 percent of users have gotten back together with people they dated in school. \n“People are looking for things that have a foundation, and they find comfort in familiarity, history and old values,” says Stephen Josephson, a diplomate in cognitive behavioral psychology at Cornell University Medical Center. \nI was hostile to her because she broke my heart. I did spy on her a bit through Facebook, though.\nBut, such situations can be unhealthy, say some experts. \n“Reuniting with past connections [can] also be based on repetition of a bad relationship and recurrence of the same old destructive patterns,” says Ari Fridkis, a Manhattan psychotherapist.\nThat was the case for Brooklyn Law School professor Jonathan Askin, 52. As a Harvard undergrad, he dated a beautiful classmate, Jocelyn Morin, for two years, but the passion eventually cooled, even when Morin attempted to reignite it by appearing in Playboy’s “Women of the Ivy League” issue. \nAfter graduating in 1986, they both went their separate ways. Each married and divorced. Askin became a successful lawyer, while Morin published several novels. \nThen, in 2011, she reached out to him with a legal question on LinkedIn. He replied and asked if she planned to go to their upcoming 25th college reunion. They both were living in New York at that point, and they made plans to get together. \n“We met in Brooklyn a few days before the reunion, went to a restaurant, a cafe, a bar and then his apartment,’’ recalls Morin, who now lives in Tudor City. “I felt like I had found someone precious who I had lost. We had been so in love and had a bond I was never able to replicate. What had dissipated at the end of our relationship was instantly back and we were totally in love again.’’ \nEmily Lyons and Ryan Clark went to nursery school together (below) decades ago. Now, they’re in love and soon-to-be sharing an apartment. Courtsey of AMA Marketing Hall Of Legends Gala \nAt the Harvard reunion, Askin and Morin stayed in a freshman dorm room together, visited the bars they used to frequent and fell back in love.\nThey dated seriously for six months, but then their passion cooled, as it had when they were younger. They decided it was best to break up.\n“Eventually we found ourselves at the same dry spot we’d encountered a quarter of a century earlier,” says Morin. “The new relationship played out [with] the same dynamic, and left us on the same shore, going our separate ways.’’\nUltimately, though, Askin says that the experience was healing. \n“That first breakup was profound and life shaking, and this was the opportunity for a do-over,’’ says Askin, who’s now happily living with another woman. “Until then, there was always the specter of that relationship haunting my life — but realizing we weren’t the perfect idealized love allowed me to get past it and find love with someone else.’’\nFor others, reuniting with an old crush offers the opportunity to explore a relationship that was never that serious in their youth — but always had potential.\nEmily Lyons, 32, and Ryan Clark, 33, first met in nursery school in Ontario, and he later tried to kiss her at a high-school party. \n“I was shy and blew him off,” recalls Lyons. “He was a jock and seemed cocky.” \nThe pair crossed paths again when she was 23, and they ran into each other in Toronto. They went out on a date, but then she moved to New York to develop her event-staffing company and he remained in Canada to work in telecommunications. \nIt wasn’t until this past fall, when she saw a photo of him on Facebook, that they really connected. \n“I messaged him: ‘Looking good, Clark,’ and he suggested we go for sushi,” says Lyons, who now divides her time between the West Village and Toronto. She and Clark plan to start living together in an apartment in the latter city in April. \nAshley Norman and Andrew Caspelli had a spark one summer in college (below) but didn’t start dating until 18 years later. Brian Zak \nAshley Norman and Andrew Caspelli had a similar trajectory. In the summer of 1999, they were both college students waiting tables in Myrtle Beach, SC. They dated a bit, but Norman didn’t want anything serious since they would be returning to distant colleges — her to West Virginia University, him to Duke in North Carolina — at the end of the summer. \n“We always had a deep connection, but at that time I wasn’t interested in pursuing anything further,” she says.\nThey kept in touch a bit here and there. Then, two years ago, Caspelli, who was living in Miami at the time, posted a picture on Facebook of a Labrador pup he’d rescued. Norman couldn’t resist. \n“I became obsessed with that dog and wanted to meet him,’’ says Norman, 38, who was living in Brooklyn at that point. She and Caspelli started chatting on social media. Then, Caspelli got a job offer to open a bar in Hamilton Heights. He moved to New York in June 2015 and started dating Norman a few months later.\nThe bar, Uptown Bourbon, opened last July. Caspelli and Norman have now been seriously dating for seven months. She’s thrilled they’re finally together, but is doubtful things would have worked out the first time around.\n“We weren’t evolved [at that point],” says Norman. “It never would have worked.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:42:40.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
