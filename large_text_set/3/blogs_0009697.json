I didn’t think much of it at first, but once I got speaking to him, I really fell for him,” said Michelle of Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire.

He might be an older model but I wouldn’t trade him in for the world.” \nMichelle and Kenny’s generation-spanning romance began back in 2006, when they met at the pub he managed.

He’s a really outgoing person anyway, so it was hard to tell if he was flirting.” \nFrom there, the couple swapped numbers but, worried about what people would think, kept their romance under wraps at first. \nEventually, though, Michelle confided in her pals about her older man. \nThey were shocked, but supportive, so she soon introduced Kenny to her parents. \nHer dad Geoff is 55, and mum Shirley is 50, meaning Kenny is older than them both. \nRecalling that first meeting, Michelle said: “I felt sick with nerves, but Kenny broke the ice and, within minutes we were chattering away. \n“They all spoke about country and western music, and John Wayne films I’d never heard of.” \nThen, just three months after they became an item, Michelle fell pregnant with Tyanna. \nAnd on New Year’s Eve 2014, their little family became complete, when Kenny proposed at midnight. \nNow, they’re enjoying married life, and keen to show people that, when it comes to love, age is just a number. \nDespite his advancing years, Michelle said that Kenny doesn’t struggle to keep up with Tyanna, claiming he’s more energetic than most younger dads. \n“People also ask if we worry Kenny won’t get as much time with Tyanna as a younger dad would,” she said.

We always correct them, but just laugh it off. \n“When we first got together, a few people questioned why I was with Kenny and thought it wouldn’t last. But he wasn’t just a flash in the pan – it was serious. \n“To anyone who has a problem with age gap relationships, I’d say get over it because it’s none of your business.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T19:45:20.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
