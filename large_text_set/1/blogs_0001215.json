Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA 20-year-old man was left red-faced when it became obvious the Christmas gift he gave his Gran was second-hand after she found the photo album already had pictures inside. \nBut as it turned out, she was delighted with the gift - because it wasn't just photographs of any old family inside. \nOh, no. It actually contained pictures of Ant McPartlin - one half of comedy presenting duo, Ant and Dec - from way back in 2002. \nRoofer Daniel Mayes was mortified when his grandmother Eileen James, 70, opened the boxed set of five albums to find one still contained a handful of retro photographs. \nHis embarrassment was spared when his aunt Tina flicked through the photos and discovered two snaps of the star holding a baby and a child.

We are hoping we can have Ant round for Christmas next year now - if he heard the antics we get up to I think he definitely would come.

So when I found the photos my poor grandson was so embarrassed. \n\"After I flicked through and spotted the photos I realised they weren't generic pictures like they sometimes put in albums. So I passed it to Tina and she spotted the ones of Ant. \n\"I am a big fan of him and Dec, we all watch I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! and I really like all the programmes they do. I think they're both amazing. Daniel Mayes, Eileen James and Tina Aziz (Photo: Michael Scott/Mercury Press) \n\"I joked we should have copies done of the photos as they are probably worth a fortune. I do want to keep one as a souvenir though.\" \nDaniel, who also lives in Leicester, also bought his gran a book for Christmas. \nHe said: \"When I realised there was still pictures in the album I was so embarrassed because it showed someone else had them before and they were from a charity shop. So when I saw the photos and who it was in them I couldn't believe it - it definitely made up for it.
