In any other circumstance, that statistic wouldn’t be notable. But in this one, it was a reminder that Curry came into the game shooting 4-of-31 behind the three-point line in his last three games.\nThere’s no sugarcoating it: Curry has never slumped this badly in his career. It’s not just the first quarter on Sunday, or the previous three-game stretch — from Feb. 8 until Sunday, Curry was shooting 27.5 percent on 9.1 three-point attempts per game. Because we’ve seen Curry shoot that many threes for two straight seasons while being much more efficient, we know that’s an anomaly.\nHere’s how bad it was, part one: Curry went to the free throw line halfway through the second quarter against the Knicks and missed both free throws. Here’s how bad it was, part two: at one point in the first half, Steve Kerr took extra time to gently remind Curry his shots aren’t the problem and he’s still making a positive impact on the floor (Curry was plus-10 at halftime despite the one-point Knicks lead).\nA wired Kerr trying to encourage Curry in the huddle, showing him his plus/minus (via @imbeccable ) pic.twitter.com/Jl1qBi5B3v \n— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) March 5, 2017 Given all that, a 15-point third quarter is exactly what Curry needed — and a huge part of it came at the rim. Curry opened the quarter with a three, but he followed it with three layups in the final 4:37 of the quarter, including this spinning beauty.\nThat’s the thing — Curry is the best shooter we’ve ever seen in the history of basketball capable of hitting shots from a dizzying number of spots on the floor, but also a deadly finisher with frightening touch and creativity around the rim. When things get tough outside, teams still fear his jumper regardless. That will always set him up to drive the ball closer.\nIt’s premature to say Curry’s slump is over, but we’re all pretty sure he’ll be back to where he normally is before long. Kevin Durant is absent, but Durant wasn’t even on the team the past two years, and that’s when Curry won a couple MVPs.\nBuzzer-beaters \nTwo of seven Sunday games were won at the buzzer.\nThe first was off a Tyler Ulis steal and three-pointer to give the Suns a win over the Celtics.\nTYLER ULIS.
