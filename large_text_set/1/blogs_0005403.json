Indeed, no more than a large container of gasoline (petrol) is needed for a successful attack. Of course, the gasoline can be acquired from any local gas station, where it is filled into the container,\" the article continues. \"This procedure should not arouse any suspicion, as it is quite common to follow, especially when obtaining gas for a lawnmower, amongst other reasons.\"\nInstructions then follow on how to make a Molotov cocktail, emphasizing that \"due to the fast rate at which gasoline burns away, it is better that one transforms the contents of his Molotov cocktail into a sticky, long-burning napalm solution, to ensure – by Allah’s permission – that the intended target properly catches fire before the gas finishes burning.\"\nTo make napalm, ISIS recommends jihadists save Styrofoam from toy packaging or pick up \"foam cups used for hot coffee at donut shops.\"\nSuggested target locations for arson attacks, the magazine states, \"include houses and apartment buildings, forest areas adjacent to residential areas, factories that produce cars, furniture, clothing, flammable substances, etc., gas stations, hospitals, bars, dance clubs, night clubs, banks, car showrooms, schools, universities, as well as churches, Rafidi [Shiite] temples, and so forth. The options are vast, leaving no excuse for delay.\"\nhttps://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2017/01/06/isis-singles-out-dallas-megachurch-in-call-for-arson-jihad/\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:21:18.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
