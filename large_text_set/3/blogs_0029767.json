If you tap on one, it’ll open your friend’s story with photos, videos, drawings and camera effects. \nEssentially, Facebook is creating a second newsfeed for the mobile generation. It is swapping text and photo updates with visual communication because it feels more personal. \nOnce you get access to stories, you’ll find a camera icon in the top left corner of the Facebook app. You can then take photos and pictures, add effects and drawings and share the result. After 24 hours, posts in your story disappear forever. Facebook is also adding new camera effects today. \nFacebook is introducing Direct as well, a new inbox for direct messages. It is reminiscent of Snapchat’s direct messages. This way, you can share photos and videos with one or multiple friends in particular, or reply to your friends’ stories. \nSo Facebook has now added stories to all its main apps — Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp. While Instagram’s stories have been a huge success , let’s see if Facebook’s user base also wants to embrace the story format. \nFacebook Stories and Direct are rolling out today. You won’t necessarily see stories straight away, but they’re on their way.
