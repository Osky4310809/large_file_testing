( CMG ). Ackman, the billionaire and activist investor at the helm of Pershing Square Capital Management, made headlines when he bought up a sizable portion of the outstanding stock for Chipotle at a time in which the restaurant had fallen in the public eye from its earlier heyday. Chipotle faced numerous problems, ranging from health scares at many of its restaurants to faltering figures which turned off investors. Ackman had been predicted to come in and make major activist changes in the way the company did business. Now, though, it looks like he's planning on selling his stake. (Read our great biography of the company, Chipotle: Rise and Fall of a Wall Street Darling. ) Pershing Square Filed a Prospectus With SEC \nHow do investors in the wider financial world know that Ackman is considering selling? Pershing Square recently filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating its intention to sell 2.88 million shares of Chipotle stock. That massive position accounts for approximately 10% of all outstanding stock in the company. \nWill Ackman be selling soon? That's difficult to say. The regulatory filing did not indicate any immediate plans to sell; in fact, Pershing Square specifically said it does not plan to sell the shares right away, but that it nonetheless \"reserves the right to do so.\" Pershing disclosed its initial purchase of Chipotle stock back in September of 2016, alongside its plans to maximize shareholder value by streamlining the cost structure of the embattled restaurant group. Difficulties for Ackman \nAckman has seen a good amount of criticism over his decision to invest as heavily as he did in Chipotle stock . Ackman had planned to sweep in with a major investment in the company and shake up the restaurant's board of directors. Critics argued that Ackman's move to install new board members was actually a reflection of a longstanding belief held by many of the company's shareholders. In fact, Chipotle shareholders had been disappointed with the company's leadership for a good deal longer than Ackman had been. Perhaps some of that has to do with the fact that Chipotle's sales figures dropped considerably up to the point at which he invested in the stock. Another major criticism of the company was its leadership structure, which centered around co-CEO positions. \nAckman also received wider flak for his assertion at the time he bought into Chipotle stock that the company had a powerful brand connected with a concept of fast food which is better for consumers than traditional fast food restaurants. That widespread belief understandably took a hit when Chipotle started to suffer from cases of customer illness. It seems that Ackman may have decided he agrees that his investment in Chipotle was poorly timed or conceived.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:45:32.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
