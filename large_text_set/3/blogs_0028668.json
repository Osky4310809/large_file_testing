According to Joe Lago of Yahoo Sports, Donovan said the following regarding his playing status: \"Yeah, I'm done. I'm done. No more playing for me. ... I have not [gone public]. But that is definitely the case.\" The 35-year-old originally retired in 2014, but he surprisingly returned to appear in six matches for the L.A.
