A teaspoon of caramel extract and a dash of sea salt make this simple smoothie taste like a gourmet Salted Caramel milkshake. Try this recipe with Chocolate or Caf√© Latte Shakeology . \nReal caramel is a sticky concoction of butter, cream, and sugar that is not part of a healthy diet. With caramel extract, you can enjoy the same sweet and buttery flavor in your smoothies and other healthy treats without any of the guilt. Look for it in the baking aisle of your supermarket near the vanilla extract.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:46:38.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
