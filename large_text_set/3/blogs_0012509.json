The BJP has also issued whip to party members directing them to be present in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday during the second leg of the Budget Session. This comes after the party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi secured unprecedented mandate in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand even as it is in sound position to form governments in Goa and Manipur. \nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday will hear a petition moved by the Congress challenging Goa Governor Mridula Sinha’s decision to appoint BJP leader Manohar Parrikar as the Chief Minister of the state. After dramatic developments, Manohar Parrikar is set to take oath as the CM this evening. The swearing-in ceremony will be held in Panaji at 5 pm.
