Continuing the wave, the Chi-Town native held a press conference on Monday (March 6) and announced he is donating $1 million to Chicago Public Schools. \nHeld at Westcott Elementary School, two blocks away from where Chano grew up, the event featured a lengthy speech by the impassioned rapper, who clearly takes public education seriously and considers Chicago’s children as the city’s “most valuable resource.” \n— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 6, 2017 \nIt follows his meeting with Illinois governor Bruce Rauner last week, where they discussed public education and other issues affecting the city of Chicago and Illinois in general. Unfortunately, Chance deemed the meeting “unsuccessful.” He went on to express his frustration and disappointment with Governor Rauner’s “inaction” and says that will not deter him from doing everything he can to help. \n“If the governor does not act, CPS [Chicago Public Schools] will be forced to end school 13 days early, which means over 380,000 kids will not have adult supervised activities in June and could possibly be put in harm’s way,” the Coloring Book rapper said with concern. \nThe “oohs” and “aahs” could be heard from the young crowd as the million-dollar check was presented. The excitement was also palatable when Chance mentioned he would be talking to Southside Chicago MC Common about what they could accomplish together. . @chancetherapper has got a call set up later to talk with @common about raising funds pic.twitter.com/KAbqaoX8ih \n— Corbin Reiff (@CorbinReiff) March 6, 2017 \nCheck out the speech above and visit Chance’s website here , for more information on how to donate to the cause.
