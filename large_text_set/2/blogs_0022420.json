Today’s recipe: roasted chicken legs with broccolini. \nShake up your “chicken for dinner” routine with this easy recipe that is cooked entirely on a baking sheet. Here, chicken legs roast to tender, juicy perfection while bright green broccolini cooks alongside. Lemon slices, a fresh chile and garlic cloves boost the flavor. \n\nRoasted Chicken Legs with Broccolini \n\n3 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil \n3 garlic cloves, smashed with the side of a knife \nKosher salt and freshly ground pepper \n2 bunches broccolini \n1 fresh chile, such as cayenne, thinly sliced \n\nPosition a rack in the upper third of an oven and preheat to 500°F (260°C). \n\nIn a large bowl, toss together the chicken legs, 2 Tbs. of the olive oil, the garlic, 3/4 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Transfer to a nonstick baking sheet, placing the chicken skin side up, and roast for 20 minutes. \n\nMeanwhile, trim the broccolini. If any stems are thicker than 1/2 inch (12 mm), cut them in half lengthwise. In a large bowl, toss together the broccolini, lemon, chile and the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. \n\nRemove the baking sheet from the oven and arrange the broccolini mixture around the chicken. Continue roasting until the chicken is golden and cooked through and the broccolini is crisp-tender, 10 to 15 minutes more. Serve immediately.
