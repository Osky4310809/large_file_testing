But is it a smart idea? By Alina Dizik 7 February 2017 \nWhen one of Howie Barokas’ employees asked to take time off to protest US President Donald Trump’s policies in Washington DC, he didn’t just give a simple nod of approval. \nNot only did Barokas, who runs a Seattle-based public relations firm, give her the day off from work without taking it from her paid time off allotment, but the company sent her off with a gift; a “protest kit” that included hand warmers, gloves, a marker pen and poster board. \nIt was the first time Barokas had given an employee leave to attend a demonstration or protest. But, given the current climate and public groundswell around causes like immigration rights after the US presidential election, Barokas feels that he can no longer keep politics outside of work. \n“We’re not going to impose our political beliefs on employees, but we believe that activism is important,” and he wants employees to feel he supports their activism, he says. \nWe believe that activism is important \nHe’s not alone. More companies — including Starbucks, Lyft, Google and Apple — are speaking out against policies put in place by Trump. These companies and others are beginning to believe that they also need to accommodate employees who also feel the need to be heard. \nSilicon Valley companies have been especially vocal in the short time since the 20 January inauguration ceremonies. For instance, on 30 January, an estimated 2,000 Google employees joined co-founder Sergey Brin and chief executive Sundar Pichai to protest a presidential executive order on immigration .

But companies see benefits, too. \nEmployees working at firms where political activism is supported may be less likely to leave because they feel the company cares about their interests, he adds. To some, it’s not so different than the reasoning behind why companies have long given employees days off to volunteer, pursue personal endeavours or take part in community service. \nA new reality \nBig companies often participate in politics through donations and lobbying but, says Adamson, those efforts are often aimed at mitigating risk for the company and have nothing to do with company or employee values. Lately, though, more executives are looking inward and reassessing how to meet the needs of the employees who are eager to express their beliefs — without alienating customers or other employees. \n“It’s uncharted territory,” says Adamson. He expects it will be a bumpy road and that some companies “are going to get black eyes” as they navigate the line between too little for employees and too much for a diverse set of customers. \nIt’s different now because we see our people being directly threatened \nAfter the recently-announced travel ban through Trump’s executive order, Ben Waber decided it was essential to allow his workers time off for political activism in part because he fears the travel ban may cut off the talent pipeline as the start-up continues to hire from a global talent pool. On 31 January, Waber, founder of Humanyze, a Boston-based start-up that uses analytics to predict employee behaviour, told his 21 employees that taking time off for protests would not count as time off. \n“It’s different now because we see our people being directly threatened,” says Waber. \nStill, he is careful not to of force anyone or even imply to employees that they should take a certain political stance. While he plans to personally advocate against the travel ban, he doesn’t want his staff to feel they’ve got to take the same views as the company, but rather to know they’ve got the freedom to support their own beliefs with their time, without losing pay or holiday time.

But encouraging activism could be detrimental in the long run, because of the potential to alienate those across the political divide. \nUltimately, the same companies that approve time off for protests now could find themselves facing even bigger hot-button topics in future — and not all employees will be on the same side of the issue now or then. Larger multinational companies — with more complex political ties and business interests — may have no choice to be further accommodating to employee efforts once they’ve begun to do so, even if they disagree as a corporation with the cause. \n“If [companies] try to prevent this [activism] from happening it will create more problems,” says Adamson. “For them it’s the lesser of two evils.” \nNew-found respect \nFor employees, getting the nod from the boss on their activism can be a welcome message. \nIf you need to drop what you are doing to attend a protest, I will encourage you \nWhen IT consultant Steve Dakhe, 38, checked his email last week, he found this message from his boss: “Please note that you are free to take time away from work to protest… Please endeavour to get your work done in a timely manner, but if you need to drop what you are doing to attend a protest, I will encourage you,” read the brief email. \nFor Dakhe, the statement was bold and “brought a different level of respect” for his superior at the small firm, where he says each employee is critical to the day-to-day success of the business. The company CEO’s willingness to sacrifice work hours in the environment they operate in is especially powerful, Dakhe says. \n“He’s willing to take that risk of productivity reduction in support of a certain cause.” \nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter .
