Emilio Flores | Corbis | Getty Images Evan Spiegel \nFor a company that got its start popularizing disappearing text messages, Snap is about to create some permanent riches . \nThe social media company created by two Stanford graduates who've yet to turn 30 filed its papers to go public on Thursday. \nCo-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy each own 20 percent of Snap, according to the prospectus. Based on a valuation that could reportedly reach $25 billion at the time of the offering, each of them would own shares worth about $5 billion. \nSpiegel and Murphy each control 44 percent of the company's voting power before the offering. Post-IPO voting control wasn't listed. \nVenture capital firm Benchmark is the biggest outside investor, with a 12 percent stake worth an estimated $3 billion. Benchmark, also a big backer of Twitter and Uber, led a $13.5 million round in 2013 at a $70 million valuation. \nLightspeed Venture Partners owns 7.7 percent worth about $1.9 billion.
