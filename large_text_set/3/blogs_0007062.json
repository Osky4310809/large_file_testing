Who could possibly have guessed that would go wrong? \nMany people rightfully thought the segment was tasteless.   \nCoddington’s sister, Megan, even called out the show. When @iamsambee makes fun of your brother for having \"Nazi hair.\" He actually has stage 4 brain cancer, but whatever floats your boat. pic.twitter.com/ULJC8nA3IX \n— Megan Coddington (@meg_kelly16) March 9, 2017 \nThe show issued an apology on social media and removed the segment that included him from the piece. We deeply apologize for offending @_that_kyle in our CPAC segment. We only learned of his condition today & have removed him from the piece. \n— Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) March 9, 2017 \nThat’s the least they could do. The show also apparently donated $1,000 to Coddington’s GoFundMe account.
