It’s an expensive Golf. A fast Golf. A super Golf. It draws the line where VW stops and Audi begins. It’s also a hot hatch that does everything supremely well without breaking your spine in half, and therein lies its charm.\nAdvertisement \n\nFling it over a snow-covered back road in Canadian winter with a couple of bros sitting in the back, and you’ll instantly understand its purpose. Bring it on a track, and you’ll know where your extra ten grand went over a GTI.\n( Full disclosure : Volkswagen Canada agreed that I could bring the Golf R at the Sanair speed circuit to try out its claimed performance. They also told me that if I’d break it, I’d have to buy it .)\nWhat Is It? \nThank God, something that isn’t a crossover! It’s a humble little Volkswagen that seats five and has a big hatch out the back that will engulf 52.7 cu-ft of cargo space when its rear seats are folded flat. That’s more than in an Infiniti QX30 by the way.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nIt’s also very attractive.\nIn the Golf hierarchy, the R is the top gun, the ultimate all-wheel-drive V-dub. It was previously known as the R32, but the replacement of the 3.2-liter VR6 engine for VW’s corporate 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo (EA888) happened a generation ago and the nomenclature changed along with it. While the European market gets a three-door and a wagon version of the Golf R (!!), as well as a GTI Clubsport (more or less this with front-wheel drive), we North Americans only get our R in a five-door configuration.\n\nStop bitching. Consider yourselves lucky to even get a Golf R in North America.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T18:39:18.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
