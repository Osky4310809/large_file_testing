The army authorities said Nigerians, particularly those in the North-East, must watch out for strange visitors “knocking on their doors.” The Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, and spokesperson, 7 Division, Maiduguri, Col. Mustapha Anka, stated this on Monday in a statement, in reaction to the suicide bombing in the Kalari area of Maiduguri on Sunday evening. Two female bombers had killed three persons, alongside themselves, when they went to the residences of one Usman and Bulama in the Kalari area, after disguising as visitors. Anka said the army had imposed curfew in Maiduguri area, as the troops continued to contain the insurgents. He said, “There is a recent trend, used by the desperate remnants of Boko Haram terrorists, which was the tactic used in the bombing of the Kalari area of Maiduguri. “The female suicide bombers knocked on the door of one Bulama and Usman about 200 metres apart, and while Bulama’s daughter opened the door, the bomber detonated her vest. The same was done in Usman’s apartment. “The general public is hereby advised to be cautious and wary of strange persons knocking on their doors. Security is a collective responsibility; the public is to engage in neighbourhood watch. Suspicious movement of persons should be reported to security agents without any delay.” Copyright PUNCH.
