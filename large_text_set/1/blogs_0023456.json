It's been very helpful having that kind of certainty here.\" 'Knock-on benefits' \nMr Lambe is at pains to emphasise that low tax was certainly not Ireland's only appeal. \nThis is an English-speaking country, with a highly educated workforce, and low costs. \nAnd he also wants me to know how much Facebook contributes to Ireland aside from tax, the 1,600 jobs, and the knock-on wealth these in turn create. \"Restaurants, rents paid, cinemas... these multinationals in Ireland actually generate a hell of a lot of economic activity.\" \nAnd yet, most of these same multinationals were remarkably unwilling to talk to me about their presence in Ireland. \nGetting businesses to talk is not usually such a problem, but when I said I wanted to mention the subject of tax, various organisations which represent the commercial world here said it might be impossible to find any companies which would be interviewed. Image caption Economist Tom Healy says that now other countries have introduced aggressive tax cuts, Ireland is struggling to compete \nIn the event, Facebook was the only one which came forward. \nPart of the problem, I was told, is the sticky topic of tax avoidance. \nCompanies stand accused of banking their profits in Ireland, where the tax rate is low, even though their operations are really based elsewhere. \nYet the economist Tom Healy believes there may be another reason why CEOs seem to have developed a new-found shyness when it comes to the subject of Ireland's tax rate. \nThe fact is, as he puts it: \"The party is over.\" \nMr Healy is director of the Nevin Institute for Economic Research, and his argument is a simple one: that Ireland had a competitive advantage when it was the only developed nation cutting corporation tax so low, allowing it to lure companies away from other countries. \nNow, however, many of those other countries have decided to play the same game. \n\"A number of East European countries, one or two of the Baltic states, have gone down the road of aggressive tax cuts. And you've really reached the point where it's impossible for a developed economy like Ireland to compete with that sort of policy.\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Phillip Hammond and Theresa May have hinted that the UK could use corporate tax cuts to draw business away from the EU \nHowever, East European countries are not though the only ones engaged in this corporate tax-cutting competition. \nThe United Kingdom under its current Conservative government has already lowered the rate from 28% to 20%, and it is set to drop further, to 17% by 2020. \nBut more than that, the Prime Minister Theresa May and her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Phillip Hammond, have dropped heavy hints that further cuts could be on the way. \nIndeed, this has been an implicit threat to other European Union states: that if they do not offer Britain an agreeable deal on trade, post-Brexit, Britain might use corporate tax cuts to draw business away from the EU, turning the UK into what one commentator described as \"Singapore on the Thames\". \n\"Don't do it,\" says Tom Healy, with a certainty that belies his otherwise cautious manner. \nHis fear is that the UK will become part of an international race to the bottom on corporate tax, with countries eventually demanding so little from business that they will no longer be able to fund public services. \n\"Tax is a factor, but the best way to bring in investment,\" he believes, \"is to develop infrastructure, skills and innovation.\" \nThe UK Treasury insists that its corporate tax-cutting approach has so far worked, encouraging investment and enterprise, and thus creating jobs. \nQuestioned about this recently, Mr Hammond said \"By being globally competitive, that's how we protect the living standards and the jobs of our people.\" Image caption Dublin City Councillor Michael O'Brien refuses to buy the idea that a lower corporate tax rate is an overall benefit to the economy \nOn a freezing cold and windy evening I put these arguments to a Dublin city councillor as we walked through the ward he represents in Coolock, one of the poorer neighbourhoods in Dublin's northern suburbs. \nMichael O'Brien points out a local hospital, which he says is suffering from a shortage of beds and staff. \nAnd he tells me about the housing issues he has to deal with, the families in temporary accommodation, and the people sleeping rough. \nHe refuses to buy the idea that a lower corporate tax rate is an overall benefit to the economy. \n\"If more tax was demanded of the multinationals and domestic businesses, it would bring in billions of extra revenue that could be spent to deal with the housing crisis, deal with the healthcare crisis,\" he argues. \n\"It's insufferable to hear the likes of Facebook extolling this low tax regime. I think people see a basic issue of tax justice.\" \nAnd with that, Councillor O'Brien heads off to try and deal with a few more problems among his constituents. \nAnd I use my smartphone to order a taxi, check emails and what my friends are posting on Facebook, and soon leave Coolock far behind.
