Instead of simply registering on a new site, however, he held a dramatic Facebook Live stream , in which he chose between four hats that each represented a social media site. The winner? Instagram! \nAs promised, Brady soon created an Instagram account and posted his first picture. In true New England style, the quarterback headed out into the snow for his first post—in it, he's gazing off into the distance with his arms raised as the snow falls around him. Brady captioned his inaugural image with, \"You can take the boy out of California ... and I think they took the California out of the boy! Instagram is coming ...\" A photo posted by Tom Brady (@tombrady) on Jan 7, 2017 at 1:26pm PST \nWith humor, a scenic backdrop, and a good-looking guy, Brady's post has all the makings of a successful inaugural 'gram. Clearly, he's learned a little something from his frequent appearances in Bündchen's feed. \nVIDEO: Gisele Bündchen & Tom Brady's Cutest Family Moments \n\nRELATED: Tom Brady and His Daughter Vivian Decorating Their Christmas Tree Will Melt Your Heart \nAfter just one day, the father of three has more than 680,000 followers—not too shabby! However, he has quite a ways to go before he's anywhere close to his wife's 11 million fans. Check out some of Bündchen's best Instagrams below and stay tuned to find out if Brady can catch up.
