But, that's just paperwork. Live-in relationships and marriage have different psychological, ideological, emotional and social bearings. It's not that one is indubitably better than the other. They are different arrangements, and, as such, come with their own sets of challenges. The decision is individual and personal, but if you are debating what might work better for you and your partner, consider these points. Family support A marriage is between families, whereas a live-in relationship is between two people (for the most part). This is both a good thing, and a bad thing, and key is to figure out how you and your partner function, and what your relationship needs. In a marriage, you will have more family support and involvement, and that might be beneficial for some couples. In a live-in, the stakes are lower, as our expectations, and this might work for some couples. Children Of course, you can have children even when you are cohabiting, and are not married. But, know that marriage has legal and social benefits for the kids. For example, a child born to a couple in a live-in relationship cannot be called illegitimate, but the father is not obliged to support the child. The mother is the legal guardian. So, essentially, understand the law, and decide what is more important to you as a parent. Commitment Many psychologists believe that cohabiting couples are not as committed to each other, and that the decision to not marry is taken because there is something preventing them from fully committing. While this may be true for the majority, one cannot generalise. What is important, however, is to assess this carefully. How committed are you to the relationship? What about your partner? Are you both on the same page? At the end of the day, that's what really matters. Health Research suggests that married couple have better physical and mental health as compared to unmarried couples (including live-in partners). Married couples report lower rates of chronic diseases, and have a higher recover rate. They are also less likely to fall under depression. It is assumed that these health benefits come from emotional stability, and social acceptance that marriage provides. That said, if you start a relationship at a later stage in life, it is more likely to be healthier, and more relaxed. In this case, the tag of marriage might not hold much value, and living together might work just as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:17:14.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
