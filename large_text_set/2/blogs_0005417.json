King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 18 hours ago 12 \nDiscussing his classic 1987 studio album \" Surfing With the Alien ,\" guitar champion Joe Satriani singled out the \" Crushing Day \" solo piece as the solo that should not be. \nHe tells Total Guitar : \"I never should have written that solo! That was some alter-ego thing where I thought it would be a really cool thing to do. I mean, I loved the idea of sweep picking, and that was one of the very first things that I recorded for 'Relativity' when I was trying to sell the idea to Barry Kobrin at the record label. \n\"This song definitely, out of all of them, echoed the time. It had that early-'80s metal sound to it and strictness.\" \nSatch added: \"The solo section is really long, and I have to say that part of that is that I was so frustrated as a struggling session player that I was always told to stop playing, like, 'No, don't use that. No, don't make those noises. No, you're playing too many notes. You can't use that technique. No sweep picking. Play more like that other thing, this guy.' And going into the solo record both John and I were like, 'Hey, we're just going to do what we want to do. There's nobody here to tell us we can't turn the guitar up or we can't have a 382-bar guitar solo!' \n\"So I think 'Crushing Day' epitomizes the idea that this guitar solo's going to be really long, and so I thought, 'I'd better work some of this shit out.' All the other ones are improvised, but this one was too long to just sit there and fiddle about. But, in retrospect, I regret it, because I've always found that when you're on stage and you're playing night after night, that sticking to the script is one of the things that will kill you in the end: it's a solo killer. \n\"But this particular song, what we found out touring through Jonathan and myself, was that this thing fell apart unless you played it exactly like the record. Of all the songs that Iâ€™ve recorded in my whole career, that is the one that is a nemesis, not really because of the technique involved, but it's just that there's something about the strictness of the recording that adds to the charm factor that when you try to redo it, upgrade it, modernize it, humanize it, that it loses its thing. And, so, it's been a nice challenge over the years.\" \nHe continued: \"I have to tell you a funny story now. It was one of the G3 tours and we came through San Francisco, and I remember thinking that I really wanted to play that song. And, so, we had rehearsed it and we had played it, and I remember Jeff scratching his head with me every night going, 'What is wrong with that song?' We tried everything. We would liven it up, we would mess it up, we would play it perfectly, we just couldn't figure out what it was. \n\"Anyway, we're playing in San Francisco, we play that song, the show goes fine, but in my mind I know I've totally blown it. It's just something about it, I don't know what it is, I played all the notes and everything. I just remember getting a note from a fan, after that show, where he said, 'What happened to 'Crushing Day'? You messed up every part.' And it illustrated to me that it wasn't just me that had a problem with the song, that even a fan felt that it was necessary to say, 'Look, all due respect, Joe, I love you, but what's up with that song?' \n\"The other funny thing that should have tipped me off years ago was when I finished the record, I remember playing it to Steve Vai. Steve really loved the record, but I remember when it came to talking about that song, he just said, 'Yes, it's a really cool song... solo's kind of worked out, though, isn't it?' And it was that little comment between friends that was very telling, because I knew that out of everybody, he knows everything: when he listens to me play, he knows the backstory, just because he knows me. \n\"We've been with each other since we were kids, but he canned it right away. He noticed that there was something fishy about it. And what I should have known when he said that was that was going to haunt me for the rest of my career! So I'm certain that if I have to play that song live again, that I'll have to come to grips with that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T15:25:59.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
