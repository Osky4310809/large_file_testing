The house used for the exterior shots of Boy Meets World is currently up for sale , and it can be yours…for a million dollars. But, price is no object when it comes to the surplus of ~very important lessons~ you’re sure to learn inside the walls of the two-story home.\nThe TGIF staple was shot on a soundstage for all seven years of its run, but the outside of the house is a real house located in Studio City, California . It was built in the 1940s, and has two bedrooms and two baths – so not the exact layout of the Matthews house we know and love today (they had three-ish bedrooms. Did we ever see Morgan’s bedroom…?).\nBonus: The house comes with a 2-story guest house. So while it’s not a backyard treehouse/basketball combo, a guest house is pretty cool.\nABC Photo Archives/Contributor/Getty Images Downside: There is a 100% chance Mr. Feeny (and/or William Daniels) will not be living next door, which means that you’re going to have to get your wise, sage advice from someone else. Or maybe your neighbor will also double as your every-year high school teachers, you never know!\nABC Photo Archives/Contributor/Getty Images Wait, another downside: The interior of the house actually looks nothing like what we saw on the show. The layout is all different, but you know, that’s fine.\nHonestly, all we’re looking for in life is the simple feeling of knowing we’re living in the Matthew House, because that brings us one step closer on our never-ending quest to relive our childhood as adults. The house also just dropped in price, from $1,595,000 to $1,299,000. WHAT A STEAL!
