It seems other manufacturers are now following suit, as some of those who pre-ordered the handset AT&T and Sprint have started to receive delivery notices for it.\nAndroid Central reports that the pre-order customers have been sent delivery notifications which indicate that the handset will arrive as soon as today (March 29) — though it’s not clear exactly which customers this applies to. Today also happens to coincide with the launch of the Galaxy S8 from LG’s South Korean rival Samsung.\nSee also: LG G6 review: it flies… like a G6! 2 weeks ago LG recently announced that Korean pre-orders for the device had beaten expectations , and it has offered a number of incentives for pre-ordering the device in the US, including a free Google Home speaker worth $129, and a free 43-inch LG Smart TV worth $350 value when activating the LG G6 on a new line with Verizon Unlimited . You can view the rest of the LG G6 US prices and offers here .\nHit us up in the comments if you’ve received a shipping notification for the handset.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:10:29.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
