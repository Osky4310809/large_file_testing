They put themselves on the line. \n\"What we saw first time around was a torrid fight and I think we will see the same again. I just can't wait.\" Venezuela-Tokyo: Who is Jorge Linares? Linares (right) has fought in England twice and won on both occasions \nLinares is no stranger to fighting on away territory having only contested four of his 44 professional bouts on home turf in Venezuela. \nUnable to fight in his homeland under the age of 18, he moved to Japan and made his professional debut at 17 - setting up in Tokyo where he admits he was initially \"always lonely\". \nSince beginning his career at the renowned Teiken Boxing Gym he has built a reputation as a fighter with fast hands and a dangerous counter-puncher. \nHe was WBC world featherweight champion at just 21, claimed the WBA crown at super-featherweight less than two years later and won the WBC title at lightweight in 2014. \nLinares believes he is \"better prepared\" than he was in his first Crolla meeting, adding: \"I'm coming in and doing whatever is necessary to win more convincingly than I did in September.\" 'Best ever' training camp Hot yoga away from the gym three times a week is part of Crolla's weekly training schedule \nCrolla, who will contest the seventh rematch of his career, has been forced by trainer Joe Gallagher to reduce media commitments and distractions in the weeks leading up to the fight. \nGallagher believes his charge is in a better place \"mentally\" and feels the winner of the contest will \"strike the jackpot\" by potentially setting up a meeting with WBC champion Mikey Garcia in Las Vegas. \n\"Joe has given me more one on one time than ever before,\" said Crolla. \"I always have faith in what he tells me to do and this time it's certainly been our best camp together. \n\"We've had more rounds of sparring and we've been smart as well, maybe more rest will have me fresher this time.\" A typical week for Crolla \nMonday AM: Punching session PM: Swimming intervals \nTuesday AM: Pads, followed by strength and conditioning PM: Yoga \nWednesday AM: Punching session PM: Swimming intervals \nThursday AM: Pads, followed by strength and conditioning PM: Yoga \nFriday AM: Sparring, followed by weights PM: Chiropractor and massage \nSaturday AM: Yoga Sunday: Rest Glove choice interesting Gallagher (right) believes the winner of the fight will hit the \"jackpot\" \nLinares had stopped seven of eight opponents before meeting Crolla, who admits their bout turned on a power punch he took in the sixth round. \nGallagher feels Linares' choice of gloves this time around indicate he is targeting a knockout. \nHe told BBC Radio 5 live: \"The brand he has picked are known as a puncher's glove. They allow you to use power. \n\"When you see the choice of gloves, it gives you an idea of game plan. They want to throw fast combinations, go hard early and try to get the job done.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:28:24.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
