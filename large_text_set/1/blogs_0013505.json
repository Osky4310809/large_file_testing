It will leave you inspired — and ready to take on the hegemony. ID: 10320301 13. Redefining Realness by Janet Mock Atria Books\njanetmock.com\n Janet Mock is one of the most visible trans women in America, but she overcame huge odds to get there. Her story is at times heart-wrenching, but ultimately inspiring — and an important read particularly as trans women continue to suffer in this country, and trans girls seek role models who look and feel like them, as Mock writes: “My story has shown that more is possible for girls growing up like I did.”\nID: 10320310 14. This Bridge Called My Back: Writings By Radical Women of Color by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria E. Anzaldúa State University of New York Press\ncherriemoraga.com\nFlickr: 42401725@N00\n Now in its fourth edition, this groundbreaking anthology — featuring the essays, art, poems, and other writing of more than a dozen feminists of color — was originally published in 1981. But as Moraga writes in her introduction to the new edition, the issues that were raised when the book was originally published are just as urgent now as they were in 198, if not more so, given the pitfalls of corporate feminism. As she writes, “Social change does not occur through tokenism or exceptions to the rule of discrimination, but through the systemic abolishment of the rule itself.”\nID: 10320345 15. Inferno by Eileen Myles OR Books\nPeggy O'Brien\n This semi-autobiographical poetic novel, published in September, tells the story of a young lesbian writer named Eileen Myles coming of age in New York, as well as the challenges of being a working writer. Myles shows that good art is always political — and how making good art has only become harder in America. As Myles writes: “The cultural wars in the United States started with poetry. I just think people should know.”\nID: 10320384 16. More Than Medicine: A History of the Feminist Women’s Health Movement by Jennifer Nelson NYU Press\nVia redlands.edu\n In the 1960s and ’70s, a group of feminists began agitating not just for equality in healthcare, but for women to be allowed autonomy over their bodies and their medical choices, particularly regarding reproductive health. This book is a stark reminder of how far we’ve come — but also how tenuous the rights that women fought for 50 years ago still are.\nID: 10320405 17. A Disability History of the United States by Kim E. Nielsen Beacon Press\nVia utoledo.edu\n This book retells the history of the U.S. through the eyes of people with disabilities — including slavery, immigration, and civil rights, areas where the lens of disability has rarely if ever been applied. It also shows the ways in which disability rights activists have been able to effect real change, not just in the ways people with disability are perceived, but in the laws that apply to them.\nID: 10320416 18. No Mexicans, Women, or Dogs Allowed: The Rise of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement by Cynthia Orozco University of Texas Press\nDon Benz\n LULAC — the League of United Latin-American Citizens — was an organization founded in 1929 by Mexican-American men that was has long been considered to be an assimilationist, bourgeois group by Latinx activists. But Orozco argues that the group was in fact much more revolutionary at the time than it seems today, and she argues that it was a significant player in the civil rights movement.\nID: 10320441 19. Citizen by Claudia Rankine Graywolf Press\nJohn Lucas\n This book-length poetic essay might be the most powerful piece of writing of the last 10 years. Maybe more. It’s almost downplaying it to call it “relevant” or “timely,” because part of Rankine’s point is that much of what she talks about with regards to race and racism — and the violence against black people in this country — has been going on for centuries and has not changed significantly in that time. And the toll that it takes on black people is immeasurable.\n“Nobody notices, only you’ve known,\nyou’re not sick, not crazy,\nnot angry, not sad—\nIt’s just this, you’re injured.”\nID: 10320478 20. Dragon Ladies: Asian American Feminists Breathe Fire by Sonia Shah South End Press\nsoniashah.com\n In this pioneering 1997 anthology, Sonia Shah shows the role that Asian-American women have played in the women’s rights movement, restoring their place in a feminist narrative that has been dominated by white women (and continues to be). “Neither the feminist movement nor the Asian American movement have taken Asian American women’s interests into consideration on their agendas,” Shah writes, and 20 years after her book was originally published, her words are still all too relevant.\nID: 10320500 21. Men Explain Things To Me by Rebecca Solnit Haymarket Books\nSallie Dean Shatz / Viking Books\n Solnit is the writer who essentially defined mansplaining, and this collection of essays shows how detrimental it can be to women’s well-being and sense of self: “Men explain things to me, and other women, whether or not they know what they’re talking about.” Solnit’s writing is trenchant but also hilarious, and anyone who has fumed at being spoken at — in person, on social media, over email or text — will find lots here to relate to, and get angry about.\nID: 10320539 22. Black Wave by Michelle Tea Feminist Press\nGretchen Sayers\n Tea’s novel, which came out last year, is a wonderfully wild and weird tale about love, drugs, queerness, and the end of the world. What at first seems like an autobiographical novel of the ’90s in San Francisco soon turns into something much more bizarre, and ultimately thought-provoking, once the protagonist (also named Michelle) moves to LA. Read it and reconsider everything you thought you knew about queer narratives.\nID: 10320553 23. Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty by Dorothy Roberts Penguin Random House\nVia law.upenn.edu\n In this groundbreaking book published in 1998, Dorothy Roberts shows how stereotypes about black women — particularly the “Welfare Queen” — have had a pernicious and persistent impact on black women’s reproductive health, both through regulation and substandard levels of care. As Roberts argues: “The systematic, institutionalized denial of reproductive freedom has uniquely marked Black women’s history in America.”\nID: 10320558 24. Sex Object by Jessica Valenti HarperCollins\njessicavalenti.com\n “I started to ask myself: Who would I be if I didn’t live in a world that hated women? ” Out of this question came Valenti’s compelling memoir about being sexually objectified as a young woman in New York. Valenti puts words to many of the emotions that young women have felt trying to navigate the treacherous world of dating, hookups, and relationships — and shows how horrible so many men can be towards women.\nID: 10320593 25. In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens by Alice Walker Open Road Media\nJamie Mccarthy / Getty Images\n This collection of Walker’s work — including essays, speeches, and reviews — spans the period between ages 22 and 48, a hugely prolific time when she also wrote The Color Purple . This vital anthology focuses on what Walker calls “womanist prose,” writing about topics ranging from Zora Neale Hurston to Martin Luther King Jr. to the oppression of black women.\nID: 10320664 26. Shrill: Notes From A Loud Woman by Lindy West Hachette Books\nJenny Jimenez\n This collection of essays by West — many previously published in Jezebel, The Stranger , and The Guardian , among other places — explore, through her own experiences, the ways in which the expectations around women’s bodies and sexuality have kept them oppressed. She also tackles online trolls, particularly the ways in which women are unsafe on social media — an issue that has only been exacerbated by the election.\nID: 10320654 27. We Were Feminists Once by Andi Zeisler Public Affairs\nbitchmedia.org\n In some circles, feminism has become cool. And Zeisler — the co-founder of Bitch Media — is here to show exactly how nefarious “cool” and corporate feminism can be in that it hardly ever effects real change, particularly when it comes to issues like the wage gap, reproductive health, and attacks on women on social media. She shows how feminism was co-opted almost from its inception, and what we can do to fight its corporatization.\nID: 10320697 ", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0814770665", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1610395891", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679758690", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558619399", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0807022047", "http://www.utoledo.edu/al/history/faculty/NielsenK.html", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1944869107", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0292721323", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0896085759", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1555976905", "http://soniashah.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1476709130", "https://bitchmedia.org/profile/andi-zeisler", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1608464660", "http://janetmock.com/", "http://jessicavalenti.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1438454384", "http://cherriemoraga.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156028646", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316348406", "http://www.redlands.edu/study/schools-and-centers/college-of-arts-and-sciences/undergraduate-studies/women-gender-and-sexuality-studies/meet-our-faculty/jennifer-nelson/", "https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/roberts1/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062435086"], "published": "2017-01-14T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T20:37:42.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
