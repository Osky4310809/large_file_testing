Sacramento plans to offer him one in the summer, and a report indicates Cousins will sign it.\nDeMarcus Cousins plans to sign a $200 million contract extension with the Sacramento Kings this summer , according to CSN California’s James Ham. Cousins will be eligible for a designated player extension due to making the All-NBA team in 2015 and 2016. Cousins is otherwise on track to be an unrestricted free agent in 2018.\nESPN’s Marc Stein reported recently that the Kings planned to offer Cousins the massive extension. Ham’s sources suggest that Cousins’ camp has been in contact with the team on the extension and that the two-time All-Star plans to sign it.\nThe Kings have not made the playoffs since drafting Cousins No. 5 overall in 2010. Cousins has often clashed with coaches, the media and occasionally teammates. He won a gold medal with USA Basketball at the 2016 Rio Olympics and currently chasing a third-straight All-Star berth and a third-straight All-NBA honor.\nThe NBA and players’ union agreed to more robust contract extension rules that will go into effect with the new labor deal on July 1 . Under the new rules, teams can offer players extensions of up to five years beginning at 35 percent of the salary cap if they meet certain criteria, such as making two All-NBA teams in the previous three years as Cousins will have. Without the designated player tag, Cousins’ new contract in 2018 could only start at 30 percent of the salary cap. That difference amounts to roughly $30-40 million over five years.\nThe Kings are currently in the hunt for the No. 8 in the West despite a 16-22 record.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T15:57:01.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
