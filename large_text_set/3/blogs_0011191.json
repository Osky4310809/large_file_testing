The former chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM ), whose middle name is Wayne, used the name \"Wayne Tracker\" to \"send and receive materials regarding important matters\" between 2008 and 2015, a letter to the attorney general's office said. \nThe email account was discovered during the investigation of Exxon to whether or not it mislead investors over climate change issues. (See also State Judge Demands Exxon Hand Over Climate Change Docs ) \nExxon has confirmed the validity of the account. \"The email address is part of the company’s email system and was put in place for secure and expedited communications between select senior company officials and the former chairman for a broad range of business-related topics,\" Alan Jeffers, Exxon spokesperson said in a statement. \nThe letter, seen by Reuters, said Exxon had found 60 documents with the \"Wayne Tracker\" email but never publicized Tillerson used the account. \"Despite the company's incidental production of approximately 60 documents bearing the \"Wayne Tracker\" email address, neither Exxon nor its counsel have ever disclosed that this separate email account was a vehicle for Mr. Tillerson's relevant communications at Exxon,\" John Oleske, Senior Enforcement Counsel wrote in the letter, CNN has reported. \nThe news will bring into question whether Exxon fully complied with the original subpoena and follows a 2016 investigation by the AG into why Exxon did not write down the value of certain assets following the fall in oil prices.
