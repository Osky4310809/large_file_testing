Gibson could be personally fined up to $220,000, and her company could be fined $1.1 million. \nMs Gibson was not in court for the ruling and had not attending previous hearings. Gibson 'misled' readers, followers about cancer diagnosis \nJustice Mortimer also said Ms Gibson had made false claims about donating a large portion of her profits to charities. \nThe company received $420,000 from sales of The Whole Pantry book and app. \nJustice Mortimer said Ms Gibson's statements about having cancer \"were obviously false\". \n\"I am satisfied that, in the context the statements were made, members of the community reading those statements would be erroneously led to believe that Ms Gibson was suffering from terminal brain cancer where this was never the case,\" Justice Mortimer said. \n\"Having conventional treatment was the premise upon which the rest of Ms Gibson's story was built â€” that is, that she turned away from the conventional treatments for cancer in favour of 'healing' herself through nutrition and other alternative remedies. \n\"There is no evidence to suggest Ms Gibson had any conventional cancer treatment.\" \nLast year, CAV took action against publisher Penguin, which paid Gibson for her book when it went on sale in October 2014. \nThe action was withdrawn just a few months later, but Penguin was fined $30,000 because it sold and promoted the book by \"making false and misleading representations\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T02:28:00.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
