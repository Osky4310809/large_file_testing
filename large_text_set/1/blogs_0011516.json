None of Deer's mares got in foal. \nBack racing, Al Kazeem won the Winter Hill Stakes, Prix d'Harcourt and Tattersalls Gold Cup to add to the five Group victories - three at the highest level - he achieved before his initial retirement. \nThe son of Dubawi returned to his birthplace of Oakgrove Stud to stand at a fee of £12,000 in a carefully managed role and Deer sent him many of his best mares. \nThe first resultant foal - pictured below - is a filly out of Avessia , a daughter of Deer's classy sprinter Averti and a sister to his Prix de l'Abbaye hero Avonbridge, who also stands at Oakgrove Stud. \nDeer's son Philip said: \"She is a cracking three-day-old filly. She is the first Al Kazeem born at Oakgrove, the first foal born there this year and the first Al Kazeem bred by Oakgrove. \n\"The dam is Avessia, a full-sister to Avonbridge, so very much a product of the stud.\" \nAl Kazeem is standing the 2017 season at a fee of £12,000 again.
