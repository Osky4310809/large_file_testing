Harries in action for Coventry (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \nThe Welshman joined Cheltenham Town on a one month loan deal from Coventry last year before breaking into the League One outfit's first team this season. \nFormer Coventry boss Tony Mowbray hailed the youngster as a \"fantastic prospect\" when he signed his professional deal back in 2015. Harries playing against Nuneaton Town (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \nAfter a series of impressive performances for Russell Slade's side, playing 13 times for the first team this season, he has attracted the Reds' interest. But Harries signed a contract extension in November to stay at the Ricoh Arena until 2020 which will raise any asking price should the defender impress. \nHe is a product of the Coventry academy and has progressed through the under-18 and under-21 squads as well as turning out for Wales at age group level.liverpool Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T09:29:38.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
