That led to the big contract, but injuries, a bar fight that led to another injury, and two suspensions for violating the league’s anti-drug policy — he has publicly advocated the benefits of marijuana use — limited him to only 50 games in the next two seasons before he said he lost his love for basketball and the Bucks eventually bought him out. Benny Sieu/Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports \nSanders was a fierce rebounder and shot blocker when he was at his best, but Cleveland.com reported that the Cavaliers will not be working him out Wednesday. He reportedly was treated for depression in 2015, and announced last month that he wanted to return to the NBA. The first step likely is determining whether Sanders has regained his passion for the game. \nIf he has, he could be the best available solution for the open roster spot the team is trying to fill if it doesn’t make a move ahead of Thursday’s trade deadline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:11:05.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
