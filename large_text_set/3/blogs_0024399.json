The VaporMax’s construction uses an entirely TPU sole and thanks to years of research and innovation the Swoosh has managed to remove excess rubber and glue. The silhouette borrows Nike Flywire and Flyknit technology for the upper and the result is a weightless experience akin to walking on, you guess it, air.\nIn order to do the VaporMax justice, we needed to find people who were risk takers and forward-thinkers. We gave the sneaker to three British individuals, each with a dynamic character and an innovative approach to their craft: GAIKA, Evian Christ and Liv Little. All three possess traits that reflect and complement the new Nike model — from GAIKA’s fearlessness as a musician and Evian Christ’s left-of-field creative vision to Liv Little’s boundless perception of what is possible.\nOur photo editorial’s concrete backdrop puts GAIKA, Evian Christ, Liv Little and, of course, VaporMax front and center.
