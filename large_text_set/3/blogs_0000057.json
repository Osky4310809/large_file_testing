Now, images of the new car have leaked ahead of its debut at the upcoming Geneva Motor Show, courtesy of Diariomotor . \nHere, the Velar’s face is revealed, displaying its variation of the Range Rover family look. along its sides, the door handles are mounted flush with the door skins a la Aston Martin and Nissan GT-R , just below the character line which stretches from the headlamps all the way to the tail lamps. \nWe can also see that the Velar’s interior will feature a touchscreen surface for HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) controls, in addition to the InControl Touch infotainment display. The steering wheel is taken straight off the full-size Range Rover, while behind that is a virtual instrument display. \nAs reported earlier, the Velar will share the same aluminium-intensive platform as the Jaguar F-Pace , with rivals such as the BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC and Porsche Macan in its sights. Where the F-Pace has sportiness at or near the top of its agenda, the Velar is expected to retain a more Range Rover level of off-roading ability. \nUnderneath, the Velar can be expected to get a range of engines similar to that of the F-Pace too; the Ingenium range of 2.0 litre petrol and diesel engines should feature, as should a 3.0 litre turbodiesel V6 and supercharged petrol V6. With its platform cousin, the F-Pace due to get a high-performance variant , a Velar SVR could be in the works for a later stage, possibly with a 5.0 litre supercharged V8 engine from the Range Rover Sport SVR .
