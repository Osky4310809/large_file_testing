He also called Barack Obama the most historic black figure, told the story about how he played an improvised show for the former president at Obama's urging, labeled Jay-Z and Lil Wayne the greatest rappers of all-time, said that guy pointing at his head was his favorite meme, said his favorite DJ Khaled phrase is \"you smart,\" talked about his daughter (and said she might be a sports star someday), talked about what he doesn't like about photo-shoots, and called this the best turn-up song.
