Megan Peters Tweet This \nIt seems like death is an inescapable part of Sherlock . The hit BBC series has housed many inexplicable deaths which Sherlock Holmes has had to deduce around, but even the show’s leads have been threatened. If you have been watching the fourth season of Sherlock , then you know it kicked off with the wholly shocking death of Mary Morstan, and fans worried that one of the show’s stars would not make it out alive. UP NEXT: Sherlock's Season 4 Finale Will Be The Series' Most Action-Packed Episode Yet \nNow, fans know that death did strike again in the season four finale, but they can breathe a sigh of relief. Fortunately, none of the show’s leads passed, but fans did learn that someone very important to Sherlock had died. And, in true Sherlock style, the revelation was rather mind-bending. \nThe shocking revelation came about when Sherlock confronts his long-lost sister Eurus at a prison known as Sherrinford. The two speak for awhile, and Eurus remarks that it’s fascinating how her younger brother can’t remember how his beloved dog Redbeard died. During the conversation, fans learn that it was not Sherlock’s dog who died when he was younger, but it was his best friend Victor Trevor. \nAs a child, Eurus murdered Sherlock’s best friend by drowning him. She was jealous that the boy got more attention than her, and Sherlock was all but ignorant of her loneliness. The incident left Sherlock traumatized, and Mycroft felt he had no choice but to rewrite Sherlock’s memories to have him forget Eurus entirely. As such, Sherlock grew up believing that his dog had passed away rather than his best friend. \nYou can check out Sherlock ’s summary of the Season 4 finale below: \n“In the final episode of this series, written by Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, long-buried secrets finally catch up with the Baker Street duo. Someone has been playing a very long game indeed and, alone and defenceless, Sherlock and Dr Watson face their greatest ever challenge. Is the game finally over?” (Photo: BBC ) \nMORE : Sherlock Co-Creator Reveals His Ideal Ending / Sherlock Stars Split After 15 Years / Sherlock Season 4 Trailer / Sherlock Photos Introduce Baby Watson / Sherlock Season 4 Episode Titles / Toby Jones To Play Sherlock's Scariest Villain Yet / Sherlock : The Abominable Bride Collectible Figures \nBenedict Cumberbatch returns as Sherlock Holmes, with Martin Freeman as John Watson, Mark Gatiss as Mycroft, Rupert Graves as Inspector Lestrade, Una Stubbs as Mrs Hudson, Amanda Abbington as Mary Watson, Louise Brealey as Molly Hooper and Toby Jones as Culverton Smith. \nCurrently, there’s no word on whether Sherlock will be renewed at any point for a fifth season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T05:05:51.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
