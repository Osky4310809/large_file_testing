And at least one animal lover called the center and offered to adopt them.\nBut Animal Care and Control officials said the fate of the dogs was up to the Department of Health, which executed them Friday because staffers feared the dogs might attack someone else.\nBut on Friday the Department of Health said the dogs were deemed “too aggressive” for adoption. They were “humanely euthanized,” a spokesman said.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:42:01.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
