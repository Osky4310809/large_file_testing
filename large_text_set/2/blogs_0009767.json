Ace Morandante/Presidential Photo MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang is leaving it to Congress to deliberate on the death penalty bill following criticisms against the removal of plunder from the list of crimes punishable by death. Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said the executive department respects the independence of Congress as a co-equal branch of government. “They (Congress) are an independent body in the same way that the executive department is a co-equal branch also. So let’s allow them to finish their deliberations,” Andanar told government radio station dzRB Sunday. “We respect their independence and we will wait for the final decision of the Lower House on their final version,” he added. Andanar expects the debates on the death penalty bill to be “very exciting and fruitful.” “There are different opinions in Congress. Let’s wait for the debates in Congress. I am certain that (there will be) very exciting and fruitful debates in the Senate that are worth watching,” he said. Asked if Malacañang would appeal to Congress not to water down the death penalty proposal, Andanar said: “You know, death penalty is part of the platforms of President Duterte when he was still running. Now that he is the president, it is not surprising that it is one of the laws being pushed by the administration.” “Let us allow Congress to draft it,” he added. Last week, Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said lawmakers supportive of the death penalty have excluded plunder in the crimes covered by capital punishment. Plunder is committed by a government official who accumulates ill-gotten wealth with a total value of at least P50 million through a combination or a series of overt or criminal acts. The crime is punishable by life imprisonment. Capital punishment was abolished in 1987 during the presidency of Corazon Aquino but was reinstated in 1993 under then President Fidel Ramos, now a senior adviser of Duterte. Death penalty was abolished anew in 2006 under former president and now Deputy House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Her successor, former President Benigno Aquino III, was also against death penalty, saying it is more important to address the problems in the justice system. 'Champion life for all' Duterte has said he is in favor of executing criminals by hanging, even threatening to execute five to six convicts per day once capital punishment is reinstated. He believes that capital punishment is not a deterrent but a retribution for criminal acts. The Roman Catholic Church, the religious group of more than 80 percent of Filipinos, is opposed to death penalty, believing that executing convicts is not the solution to criminality. Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines President Archbishop Socrates Villegas has also asked the government to “champion life for all,” as no person “is ever beyond redemption.” Malacañang also distanced itself from alleged efforts to oust Alvarez as speaker because of his strong push for the death penalty. “I repeat, the Lower House is independent,” Andanar said. Andanar believes Alvarez’s statements stemmed from his dedication and his support to the policies of the president. “I think, Speaker Bebot Alvarez is just standing his ground because we know that President Duterte and Speaker Alvarez think along the same line when to comes to policies,” he added.
