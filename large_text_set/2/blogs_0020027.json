The Void is a John Carpenter tribute project centering around a small-town sheriff that finds himself trapped in a hospital with people who are all victims of the plot of a death-obsessed madman. \nWith a group of otherworldly beings waiting just outside of the hospital, those inside begin to panic as they attempt to escape the inexplicable wrath that lay outside those doors. \nFor now, you can get an early taste of what to expect from The Void via an official trailer above.
