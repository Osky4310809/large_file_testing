So the recipient starts texting back pictures of various famous Sams, like Sam from Lord of the Rings and Sam from Game of Thrones. via: Imgur PW assumes the reason \"Sam's girlfriend\" isn't taking the situation seriously is that Sam is a bad dater, and his girlfriend is \"crazy\" to stay with him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:06:18.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
