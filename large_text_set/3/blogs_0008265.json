The team’s so called biggest “winner” was off, revelling as his teammates “rolled over for a tummy tickle” . Fans chant 'Wenger Out' 0:30 \nAnd Sanchez couldn’t control himself on the bench, seen smirking after a conversation with goalkeeper Petr Cech, who isn’t preferred for Champions League matches. \nThe pressure on Wenger will ramp up another notch following Arsenal’s worst ever loss at the Emirates, and with an FA Cup game up next and their Premier League top four hopes on the line, fans are demanding he leaves. \nThey protested before the game, and by the end their anger was equally directed at referee Tasos Sidiropoulos, who had initially shown Koscielny a yellow card before changing his mind to brandish a straight red. Ref changes mind, shows red 1:10 \nYet The Mirror’s John Cross said that was: “no excuse for another sorry, miserable capitulation which was exactly the same story and scoreline from the first leg in the Allianz Arena.” \nNeil Ashton, chief football reporter for The Sun , went one further, decrying the loss as the “death” of Arsenal. \n“Arsenal Football Club, Rest In Peace,” he wrote. This institution, one of the most famous clubs in the world, is dead and buried. \n“Here at the Emirates, the heart finally stopped beating. This defeat, so big the vidiprinter had to spell out TEN in letters, is a disgrace.” — Helen Miller (@MsHelicat) March 7, 2017 \nFrom there, the reaction descended into criticism of Wenger, and analysis of his demise at the helm of a club he had made so big in the Premier League era. \n“The last 10 years in terms of league trophies and the Champions League, it’s been a disappointing time for Arsene Wenger,” said Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport. \n“It’s disappointing to see him go out on this note after all he’s done. At this moment in time things are not going right and he can’t seem to find the answer.” \nArsenal club legend Ian Wright went one step further, describing it as the worst period he can remember in the club’s history. — Helen Miller (@MsHelicat) March 7, 2017 \n“It’s a sad day because we’ve gone out again at this stage,” he said, also saying Wenger looks “lost.” \nWright added: “We’re going through a period in our history that’s the worst in history I can remember. \n“With everything that’s going on you have to say it will take some sort of monumental effort for Arsenal to turn it around in terms of the drive and determination of the players. It feels like something is coming to an end.” \nAnother former player from Wenger’s golden early years in charge came out to say his time is up. THE i SPORT: WENGER OUT (of Champion's League) #tomorrowspaperstoday #bbcpapers pic.twitter.com/opw9jJ8BjM — Helen Miller (@MsHelicat) March 7, 2017 \n“I feel that the time has come,” Brazilian midfielder Gilberto Silva told Sport 360. \n“The more the past is coming to a close, the more his time is coming - not because he can’t do the job any longer, but, perhaps because the other clubs have changed their way of working, the way of doings things. \n“He hasn’t changed much, he hasn’t changed his way of working - not because he doesn’t want to, but it is not so easy to compete with clubs who spend a lot of money every season.” \nIt was this point – Wenger’s inability to adapt over the years – which Ruud Gullit believes will see the Frenchman’s reign end with his early successes ignored. Awful Arsenal, Madrid victory 2:29 \n“The thing is, Arsene Wenger was most successful with the team he inherited,” Gullit said on beIN Sports.” The back four he inherited and was strong, then he put [Thierry Henry] in there and that added some power and technique … but since then they never had it. \n“He was obsessed with Barcelona and their tiki taka play and he brings that to the Premier League but it’s too difficult. He’s still stuck with certain football but he doesn’t have the players to do it. \n“I like Arsene Wenger and I think even the fans like Arsene Wenger, but they just want him to decide to go out. If he decides to go out, I think they will give him a standing ovation for what he has done. Now it’s more ‘come on, do something’. It’s almost like what are you going to do now? Where are you going to hide?” \nAnd as the walls crumbled around Arsene Wenger, Alexis Sanchez grinned on the bench. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
