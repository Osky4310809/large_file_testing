The Vietnam South Central Coastal area has long been shaped by one-storey houses, which are simple but glamorous. We are not an exception.\n© Quang Tran \nThe agreement to renovate an ancestral house from the 1960s was a huge challenge for the design team. Trusted by the homeowner, we have come up with a bold idea, which is not only to preserve the traditional speciality, but also to harmoniously combine it with the modern features into the construction. In order to pursue that target, we have reorganized the inner spaces, as well as simplified the house function. Generally, the house is divided following the rule of thirds (1:3), segregating tradition and modernity. \n\nIn the worship space, the homeowner wants to make use of the old interior. \n© Quang Tran \nThe living space is separated by using the furniture, combining with an inner garden and a big skylight, which enhances the provision of natural light and plays a big role in creating of a comfortable living space.\nFirst Floor Plan \nWe have also considered experimenting the facade solution, which may bring something new but not too different from the surrounding neighborhood.\n© Quang Tran \nTP House represents a perfect combination of the traditional and local architecture with the modern one, familiar but not so popular.\n© Quang Tran \nProduct Description. For the spinning windows system, main door and some other decorative details on the facade, we have considered using the local Pyinkado wood as the most possible material. This type of wood can be easily found at any local carpenter’s shops and has long been applied in house construction. Moreover, with flexibility and water-proofing, Pyinkado wood has proved its durability through years and become a speciality of local houses.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:01:31.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
