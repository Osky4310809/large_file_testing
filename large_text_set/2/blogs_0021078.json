But Japan feels differently: Kewpie Mayonnaise is opening some limited-edition mayonnaise cafes in Nagoya and Tokyo. They’ve done this before, and it was a hit. So why not give it another go?\nHere’s the thing, though: Japanese mayo is not American mayo . Some say it’s better.\nIf you’ve ever eaten Japanese street or soul food , you may be aware of the complexity of its flavor, with spices and flavors like olive, wasabi, basil and tomato, that help it surpass stateside mayo.\n“The unique taste of tenderness,” goes the Kewpie Mayonnaise slogan. キューピーカフェ&アンドピプってきた （パクり） めっちゃ楽しかった #andpeople#light#Kewpiecafe#l4l#happy#bff \nA post shared by ｍａｋｉ (@mk__ansom) on Mar 24, 2016 at 3:55am PDT \nThe Kewpie brand launched its made-in-Japan mayo in 1925.\nFounded by Toichiro Nakashima, he discovered our strange, white condiment while he studied food production in the U.S. At the same time, he came across the Kewpie cartoon characters created by Rose O’Neill. He whipped up his own mayo recipe, bottled it and slapped a Kewpie doll on the label, and henceforth the world experience with mayonnaise was improved.\nThough the Kewpie Mayonnaise history is compelling, when it comes to a whole cafe dedicated to the sauce, our immediate response is still #why?\nBut that might be because we’ve never been to one.\nMaybe the Kewpie doll decor makes it. 【グルメ・スイーツ】【旅行・イベント】《～3/31までの期間限定！マヨラーは渋谷へ急ぐべし！「キユーピー マヨカフェ」》 https://t.co/3uWiK6msHS pic.twitter.com/ahFlGX18h2 \n— maQaron 相互フォロー100% (@maqaron_jp) March 14, 2016 Or the mayo bottles hanging from the ceiling. 【マヨカフェ限定OPEN】\n\n3月1日はマヨネーズの日とかで、キユーピーが今月限定のマヨカフェをプロデュース！読んでたらマヨネーズの口になってきた〜 https://t.co/q6WVfMzDQj \n\nfrom フードコミュニティ pic.twitter.com/kJMBbIVAja \n— VingleJapanese (@VingleJapanese) March 8, 2016 Or the fact that you can put it on or in literally everything , if that’s your style.
