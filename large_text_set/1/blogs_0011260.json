These 23 Celebrities Said They'd Move If Trump Won Share Share Tweet \nBack in September, my colleague Catherine Dunn published this nice compilation of 23 celebrities who said they would be leaving the country if Donald Trump were elected president. Given that Trump was indeed elected president and will be inaugurated on Friday, I thought it would be prudent to check in and see if any of these celebrities had stayed true to their word. \nIt's time to find out: have they decided that America is actually already pretty great? \n1. Jon Stewart \nWhere was he headed? Another planet. \nWhere is he now? Still on earth. \n2. Chelsea Handler \nWhere was she headed? Spain. (Kudos for the originality, Chelsea.) \nWhere is she now? Still in the U-S-of-A. Shortly after the election, Handler backed out of moving. She's currently filming season 2 of her show for Netflix. \n3. Neve Campbell \nWhere was she headed? Canada. (She's a Canadian native and a Canadian citizen.) \nWhere is she now? Still in the United States. On Thanksgiving, she posted a message on Instagram imploring people to try to see eye-to-eye despite the divisive times. A photo posted by Neve Campbell (@nevecampbell) on Nov 26, 2016 at 4:30pm PST \n4. Barry Diller \nWhere was he headed? \"Out of the country.\" \nWhere is he now? Diller appears to still be in the United States. \n5. Lena Dunham \nWhere was she headed? Vancouver. \nWhere is she now? The United States, and posting a ton of rainbows on Instagram to cope with the upcoming inauguration. A photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Jan 14, 2017 at 11:31am PST \n6. Keegan-Michael Key \nWhere was he headed? Canada. \nWhere is he now? Not Canada. Thank you @KeeganMKey and @DannyDeVito for joining us at the #RFKennedyGala last night! pic.twitter.com/UFNq4jtmti — Kerry Kennedy (@KerryKennedyRFK) December 7, 2016 \n7. Chloë Sevigny \nWhere was she headed? Nova Scotia. \nWhere is she now? She appears to still be in the USA and has quite a few movies coming out in 2017. A photo posted by Chloe Sevigny (@chloessevigny) on Nov 8, 2016 at 6:03pm PST \n8. Al Sharpton \nWhere was he headed? \"Out of here.\" \nWhere is he now? Given that he'll be appearing at a protest on Thursday, I'm going to say he's still living in the U.S. \n9. Natasha Lyonne \nWhere was she headed? A mental hospital. \nWhere is she now? ...not a mental hospital. (According to her Twitter, she's in the U.K.) In spirit only. I'm in U.K. Solidarity shout out to all the good people and @OITNB ladies who'll be there in the flesh! #WomensMarch ??? https://t.co/cabrmBLVrI — natasha lyonne (@nlyonne) January 13, 2017 \n10. Eddie Griffin \nWhere was he headed? Africa. \nWhere is he now? Baltimore. — Eddie Griffin (@EddieGriffinCom) January 14, 2017 \n11. Spike Lee \nWhere was he headed? Brooklyn. \nWhere is he now? Brooklyn! A photo posted by Spike Lee (@officialspikelee) on Jan 16, 2017 at 2:30am PST \n12. Amber Rose \nWhere was she headed? \"Out!\" \nWhere is she now? USA. A photo posted by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Jan 13, 2017 at 7:37pm PST \n13. Samuel L. Jackson \nWhere was he headed? South Africa. \nWhere is he now? Not entirely sure, but these tweets don't look like someone who is leaving any time soon. (language warning) The Last Time I survived Jim Crow I was Poor, guess what MOTHERFUCKERS.. Not This Time!! Enjoy your newfound win,Bigly!! — Samuel L. Jackson (@SamuelLJackson) November 11, 2016 Why y'all so anxious for me to leave?! I pay More Taxes than All U Trumpafukkaz... Him too!! — Samuel L.

His Twitter bio says he's \"currently in New York.\" \n20. Miley Cyrus \nWhere was she headed? Anywhere, \"leaving.\" \nWhere is she now? California. To Cyrus' credit, she posted a picture on Instagram after Trump's victory saying that it was important to be \"accepting\" of his presidency to help unify the country. A photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Nov 9, 2016 at 8:19am PST \n21. Ruth Bader Ginsburg \nWhere was she headed? New Zealand. \nWhere is she now? Still on the bench of the United States Supreme Court. \n22. Amy Schumer \nWhere was she headed? Spain. \nWhere is she now? America. She now says that her threat to move to Spain was a joke . \n23.
