Jordan Morris sits with FC's Taylor Twellman to discuss the firing of Jurgen Klinsmann and USMNT life under Bruce Arena. Jurgen Klinsmann posted a heartfelt thank you to the U.S. National Team following the appointment of Bruce Arena as coach. \nFormer United States head coach Jurgen Klinsmann is reportedly a candidate to become the next Bayer Leverkusen maanger, with his name on a three-man list published by German paper Bild on Tuesday. \nOn Monday, Leverkusen appointed Tayfun Korkut as their head coach until the end of the season following Roger Schmidt's departure at the weekend. \nKlinsmann left his role as U.S. boss in November 2016 following a poor run of results during 2018 World Cup qualification, and has since been replaced by Bruce Arena. \nIt is being reported that the 1990 World Cup winner with Germany could return to the Bundesliga eight years after being forced out of Bayern Munich in April 2009, and reunite with his former Nationalmannschaft teammate Rudi Voller, Leverkusen's sporting director. \nBild also lists Hoffenheim's Julian Nagelsmann, 29, and Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner as the other contenders for the role. \nLeverkusen are currently ranked 10th in the German league, and are trailing seventh-placed Cologne -- the spot that could ensure Europa League playoffs if either Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund win the DFB Pokal -- by three points with 11 matches left to be played this term. \nStephan Uersfeld is the Germany correspondent for ESPN FC.
