These injuries would inflict significant and irreparable harm on U.S. businesses and their employees, stifling the growth of the United States’ most prominent industries.” \nLast month, 97 tech companies signed onto an amicus brief in opposition of Trump’s first proposed travel ban . Other tech companies on board this brief include Warby Parker, Udacity, Square, Twilio, Postmates and Pinterest. \n“Barring people from entering our country because of where they’re from is wrong,” Airbnb Head of Policy Chris Lehane said in a statement. “Our community’s mission is to allow anyone to belong anywhere, and we will take a stand when we see policies that conflict with our values.” Featured Image: Andrew Harrer/Getty Images 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T18:18:02.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
