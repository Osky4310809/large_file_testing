We're so excited.\" \nThey added: \"I think we'll get on with everybody, I think everybody needs Jedward the most. Victory: Will Jedward win this year's Celebrity Big Brother? (Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire) \nAsked if they will bring a bit of naughtiness into the house, the duo said: \"Of course that's us. That's part of us.\" \nThe two waltzed into the house in a cloud of smoke and dressed as astronauts before performing for their fellow housemates. Celebrity Big Brother 2017: most shocking moments so far \nThey entered the house just moments after it was revealed actor James Cosmo would be automatically facing the first live eviction. \nIn true Big Brother style, the series had kicked off with a rather cruel twist, with the ‘All Stars’ given the power to ‘edit out’ fellow housemates. \nStacy Francis, Cosmo and Brandon Block were the first to be ‘edited out’, which meant that they had to wear beige tracksuits and were excluded from any house activities. \nGames Of Thrones star Cosmo was not selected by All Star celebrities Jamie O'Hara and Angie Best who had the chance to save the \"edited out\" housemates. \nIt was also revealed that the edited out celebrities, also including singer Ray J Norwood and model Bianca Gascoigne, will not be allowed to nominate for the first eviction. \nA major row erupted between housemates Heidi Pratt and Austin Armacost in scenes aired on Friday’s show. \nArmacost was summoned to the diary room after losing his rag with the reality star over stolen bottles of water.
