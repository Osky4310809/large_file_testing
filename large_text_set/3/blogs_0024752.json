They noted that the president is making some “great moves” and “he’s doing a lot for this country.” \nWatch the video above to see more reactions over the costs to secure Trump Tower. \n—— \nThis is an ongoing series featuring Mediaite’s Travis Irvine approaching your favorite cable news personalities to ask them the questions they might not get asked on television. Check in with Mediaite regularly to see who our “gentleman’s paparazzi” will find next! \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:38:46.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
