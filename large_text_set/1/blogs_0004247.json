Bush and his wife, Laura Bush, will both be attending the Inauguration. \nEven former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton will be in attendance. \nOne can imagine what a challenge that will be for Hillary considering she had so counted on it being her own inauguration. \nBut there will be someone absent from all the revelry. \nJeb Bush has announced that he will not be attending, according to the Tampa Bay Times. \nJeb went into the 2016 presidential campaign with a big war chest and, to some, as the presumed favorite. \nHe lost in the primary to President-elect Donald Trump in a highly-charged battle, with barbs traded back and forth and Trump skewering Bush as ‘low energy.’ \nAt the end of it, Jeb refused to endorse Trump. \nJeb actually liked some of the nominees Trump has selected for his new administration, according to the Daily Caller \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, EPA head Scott Pruitt, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and Labor Secretary Andy Puzder all supported Jeb during the Republican primary. The former Florida governor came out in favor of these Trump picks in December. \nJeb also didn’t attend his brother’s inauguration. \nAccording to the Tampa Bay Times , the last time Jeb Bush attended an inauguration was for Ronald Reagan, when his father, George H.W. Bush, was sworn in as Vice-President. LIKE this article?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T07:20:22.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
