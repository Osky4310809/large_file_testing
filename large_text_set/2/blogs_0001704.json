However, it looks like the option to get the cheaper 32GB version is no longer available directly from the company. The Google Store has stopped listing that model of the Pixel C, though the 64GB version is still available for $599.\nSee also: Best Android tablets 2 weeks ago While it’s possible that you can pick up the 32GB version of the Pixel C through third-party retailers, the fact that Google is no longer selling the model likely means that it has run out of its inventory and will not be making any more to sell to the public. We suspect the same will happen with the 64GB version in the not too distant future, so if you have been waiting to pick one up, now might be a good time to do so.\nYou can also still purchase the optional keyboard for the Pixel C via the Google Store, but it will add another $149 to the price tag. The good news is that while it shipped with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow , Google has offered OTA updates to get the tablet up to speed with Android Nougat , including the upcoming 7.1.2 OS update .\nAs a refresher, the Pixel C has a 10.2-inch LTPS LCD display with a resolution of 2560 x 1800, a 1.9GHz octa-core NVIDIA Tegra X1 processor, 3GB of RAM, an 8MP rear camera, a 2MP front-facing camera and a 34.2Whr battery that is supposed to offer up to 10 hours of battery life. The tablet has Wi-Fi support but no built-in cellular wireless hardware, and it also does not have a microSD card slot, which means you are stuck with its 64GB of storage.\nSo far, there’s no word on if Google will launch another first-party Android tablet. However, it recently announced that it will soon allow companies to make tablets and 2-in-1 devices with Chrome OS that will be able to run Android apps , so perhaps Android tablets won’t be going away after all.\nGet it from Google Store ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:07:13.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
