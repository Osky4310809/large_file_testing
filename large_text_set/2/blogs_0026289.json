King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 14 hours ago 34 \nAs reported, Metallica was banned by Chinese government from playing some of their staple songs during recent shows in China, including \" Master of Puppets ,\" \" One \" and \" Hardwired .\" \nJames Hetfield was asked about the whole matter by South China Morning Post , to which he replied: \n\"Why shouldn't you respect their culture when you're there as a guest and you've been invited to play? We want to be respectful, and just because we do things differently, it doesn't mean it should be forced upon [others]. \n\"But hopefully we'll keep coming back and they'll realize we're not a threat politically and we have no agenda except to cross boundaries with music and let people enjoy the songs. We're not trying to bring a secret message to anybody.\" \nMetallica is not the only metal giant to face the government banhammer, as Iron Maiden were also forced to make adjustments to their recent shows in China, including the removal of the Union Jack flag from \" The Trooper \" performance. \nBruce Dickinson told the Chinese crowd: \"We don't really give a shit about all that, because the most important thing is the music. The most important thing is that we're here, and you're here, and we're going to have a great fucking time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:57:12.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
