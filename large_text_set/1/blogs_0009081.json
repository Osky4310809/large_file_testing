(Credit: REUTERS/Mike Blake) 5411223 \nIncoming Press Secretary Sean Spicer asserts that the media doesn’t treat President-elect Donald Trump with enough respect, according to a Sunday report from The Hill. \nSpicer argued that the media tends to disrespect Trump, while at the same time promote Democrats. That treatment betrays a deeper misunderstanding of how Trump won the election, but Spicer also adds that the media “seems to” understand Trump’s electoral win was based on a national movement. \n“There’s some positive aspects here and there, but largely it still continues to not treat him with the respect that he deserves,” Spicer said about the media. \n“I think for a lot of folks inside the beltway, and inside pundit-world, they don’t fully appreciate the understanding that he has of where the American people are,” Spicer continued. “They continue to mock him in ways, when it frankly just shows the lack of understanding of that they have of where the American people are and what they think.” \nIn contract to the media’s disrespect of Trump, Spicer asserts that the media largely supports Democrats in news coverage. “There are countless examples of the media engaging — overtly or covertly — cheering on Democrats and there’s no accountability. But it’s also not even frowned upon,” he said. \nTrump’s campaign has never been a friend to the media, with the candidate frequently calling out members of the press during campaign events. Trump also called out several reporters through his Twitter account, denouncing coverage the candidate didn’t agree with. \nSpicer could have a point, since the leaked Clinton campaign emails of former Clinton aide John Podesta revealed that several members of the media in large news outlets had a friendly relationship with members of the Clinton campaign. Some reporters even sent unsolicited tips on how the campaign could conduct business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:42:08.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
