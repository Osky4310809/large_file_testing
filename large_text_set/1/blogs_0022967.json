Why? Because Black Panther is shaping up to be one of the most epic movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And now, we finally have the full list of actors joining the lineup.\nMarvel just released the announcement that Black Panther is finally starting production and with it, Marvel fangirls all over the world screamed.\nA historic Marvel start-of-prod. announcement for #BlackPanther . Exciting to see all these names in a studio movie, let alone one so huge. pic.twitter.com/FLDQftWLKc \n— jen yamato (@jenyamato) January 26, 2017 So who is in this stellar lineup? Chadwick Boseman will return as T’Challa. If you remember, he made an awesome first impression in Captain America: Civil War , along with his bodyguard Ayo, played by Florence Kasumba. Michael B. Jordan will play the lead villain. The brilliant Lupita Nyong’o will also be a member of the Dora Milaje — a group similar to the Secret Service. Adorable British men Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman will be reprising their roles in the film as well, as bad-guy Klaw (from Age of Ultron ), and security advisor Everett K. Ross ( Civil War ).\nAnd did we mention that Angela Bassett AND Forest Whitaker are also in this film? How is it possible that we are even containing our excitement for this film? Oh, that’s right, we aren’t.\nI have high hopes for Black Panther because I see a great list of cast. IM SO EXCITED FOR THE MCU.\n— cole scherbatsky (@COL3PLAY) January 27, 2017 The cast for Black Panther is absolutely fantastic. More excited for this one than any Marvel movie since the first Avengers.\n— Tim Frankovich (@timfrankovich) January 27, 2017 Black Panther really is my second anticipated CBM so far in the next several years. So much talent in front and behind the camera. Amazing.\n— Rron R2 (@rron007) January 26, 2017 Black panther has started filming and my body cant contain how excited I am\n— ㅤ (@poedamcron) January 22, 2017 Yes, the cast is stunning and probably one of the most talented groups of actors ever assembled (haha, get it?). But even the team working behind the scenes has fans in a frenzy and taking note of how huge this film will be for superhero films as a whole.\nBlack Panther started production. Rachel Morrison is the director of photography. Is she the first woman to lens a superhero movie?\n— Melissa Silverstein (@melsil) January 26, 2017 Black Panther has a female DP, a female editor, a female production designer and a female costume designer. That's awesome.\n— Denizcan James (@MrFilmkritik) January 26, 2017 Marvel Studios also released a short and pretty vague summary of the upcoming film:\nBlack Panther follows T’Challa who, after the events of Captain America: Civil War , returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T’Challa’s mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk. We still have more than a year to see Black Panther on the big screen. But now that we know how epic it will be, February 16, 2018, can’t arrive soon enough!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:04:19.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
