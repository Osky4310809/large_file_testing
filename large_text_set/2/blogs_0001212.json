Today, the U.S.-based company is showing solidarity with those corners affected by Trump's immigration ban by donating 100% of its share of all sales to the American Civil Liberties Union.

For a complete list of participating artists and labels, go here . \nBandcamp staff have highlighted several artists from the countries affected by the immigration ban, as well as Mexico, since Trump is still promising to build his border wall. Their picks include everything from Syrian black metal to Libyan desert blues to Sudanese beat science and are well worth checking out . Or you can just take the plunge down the Bandcamp rabbit hole and make your own discoveries. Nearly everything on Bandcamp can be streamed in its entirety, but today especially, make sure you click that \"buy\" link and support the ACLU. Andy Hermann is L.A. Weekly's music editor.
