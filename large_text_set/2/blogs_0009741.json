The search turned up Kislyak’s communications, which the FBI routinely monitors, and the phone call in question with Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general with years of intelligence experience. \nFrom that call and subsequent intercepts, FBI agents wrote a secret report summarizing ­Flynn’s discussions with Kislyak. \nYates, then the deputy attorney general, considered Flynn’s comments in the intercepted call to be “highly significant” and “potentially illegal,” according to an official familiar with her thinking. \nYates spoke to intel chief James Clapper and CIA head John Brennan , who agreed that the Trump White House should be briefed, while FBI head James Comey reportedly opposed notifying them because of “concerns that it could complicate the agency’s investigation.” \nWaPo says Comey eventually “backed away from his opposition” and Yates and another national security official spoke to the White House counsel on the matter. \nThe most recent comment from the White House on this issue is Sean Spicer ‘s statement that President Trump is “evaluating the situation.” That came an hour after Kellyanne Conway said Trump has full confidence in Flynn . \n[ image via Defense Intelligence Agency ] \n—— \nHave a tip we should know?
