Jamie was keen to win a toy by any means Credit: Damien Murphy/Facebook/PA \nM r Murphy, 35, said he was sitting with Jamie's five-year-old brother, Shane, before hearing \"muffled complaints\" behind him. \nHe said: \"I turned around and just see Jamie's face looking out from behind the glass. \n\"I wasn't surprised at all really. He's a very mischievous, sharp kid who's always pushing boundaries. \n\"He was inside for about 10 minutes and was worried for maybe 10 seconds at the start but then he just found it hilarious.\" Jamie walked away unscathed with two new toys Credit: Damien Murphy/PA \nA s staff searched for keys to the machine an off-duty fireman helped extract the child, Mr Murphy said. \nHe added: \"Luckily, a fireman was there and is used to dealing with situations like these. He told Jamie to crouch down and then he was able to shimmy out. \n\"He got to keep two dragon toys after picking them up inside. He's not embarrassed about it or anything, he just laughed about the whole thing.\" A fireman helped get the boy out Credit: Damien Murphy/Facebook/PA \nM r Murphy, a social media adviser, insisted the episode was genuine and not a stunt, adding there would always be doubters claiming the scene was a set-up. \nI t's not the first time a child has been trapped in a claw machine. \nIn 2014, 18-month-old Colin Lambert climbed into one in Maryville, Tennessee. Then, in 2015, Henry Howes, four, suffered the same fate at an arcade in Tamworth, Staffordshire. \nJump 'n' Gyms, which is closed on Tuesdays according to its website, was not immediately available for comment.
