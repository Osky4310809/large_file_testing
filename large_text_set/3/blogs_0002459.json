I believe, during the next week, especially for the weekend [Chelsea Cup tie], he will be fine and we don’t have major problems. \n\"Bastian [Schweinsteiger] has a little thing but, apart from that, everybody is fine.\" Mkhitaryan suffered an ankle injury after this challenge by Danny Rose back in December (Photo: PA) \nA thigh injury sidelined Mkhitaryan for a month in the autumn and he also spent two weeks out with an ankle injury following a rough challenge by Tottenham full-back Danny Rose in December. \nSince returning to the first-team in late November, Mkhitaryan has scored six goals, assisted another five, won the Goal of the Month award for December and received six man of the match awards. \nHis solo strike at Leicester was also nominated for the February Goal of the Month award. poll loading Who will win the FA Cup? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T11:11:21.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
