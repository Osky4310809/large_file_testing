Now it appears that in addition to the Xperia XA 2017, Sony also seems to be working on a new variant of the Xperia X smartphone. Ahead of an official announcement, an alleged live image of the Xperia X 2017 has surfaced online. \nThe photo looks like the retail box of the Xperia X 2017 model. The device appears to have narrow bezels on the sides, top and bottom. \nThere’s no way to confirm the authenticity of this image, so it’s advisable to take this with a pinch of salt.
