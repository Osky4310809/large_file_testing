In the clip he promised that he had \"lots of new music coming in 2017\"; now, that music is here. Young has blessed us with the premiere of a new song he's putting out under the name YehMe2 —it's a rollicking club remix of Gucci Mane and Drake's \"Both.\" He speeds up the original and replaces its haunting keys with uptempo jersey club and trap-influenced percussion. A flurry of breakbeats and 808 claps provide DJs and aux-cord wielders alike with party fuel for any situation. \nOver email, Young explained the basis for the music we can expect him to release as YehMe2. \"My whole idea behind this project is taking all my favorite songs and flipping them how I hear it,\" he wrote. \"Like, what if this beat was produced by me instead of them.\" \nYou can stream the track below, download it for free here , and check out his previous solo release—a mix of originals and edits he put out last year called Steal This Mixtape — here .
