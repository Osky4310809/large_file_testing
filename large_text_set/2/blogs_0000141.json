The two green towers could provide the city with a breath of fresh air, producing around 132 pounds of oxygen every day as they absorb carbon dioxide. They'll accomplish this air-cleaning feat with 1,100 flourishing trees from 23 local species and 2,500 cascading shrubs and plants .\n\n\nThe two towers at 656 feet and 354 feet tall will rise above the Nanjing Pukou District, which Stefano Boeri Architetti's press release describes as an area that will likely lead modernization efforts in the south of China's Jiangsu province and help develop a Yangtze River economic zone. Nanjing Yang Zi State-owned Investment Group Company Limited is promoting the towers and is listed by Stefano Boeri Architetti as an investor in the project.\nRelated: Vertical forest Mountain Hotel will clean the air in Guizhou, China \n\nThe taller tower will hold offices, a museum, a green architecture school, and a rooftop club. The second tower will host a 247-room Hyatt hotel and rooftop swimming pool. A podium 65 feet high will include shops, restaurants, and a conference hall. Balconies on the buildings will allow inhabitants to get up close to the nature thriving on the building facades.\n600 tall trees and 500 medium-sized trees will grow on the towers, and Stefano Boeri Architetti says the trees and cascading plants will help regenerate biodiversity in the area.\nNot only will the green towers be the first in China, but in all of Asia . And they probably won't be the last - the ambitious architecture firm aims to design vertical forests in Shanghai, Guizhou, Shijiazhuang, Liuzhou, and Chongqing. Stefano Boeri Architetti aims to continue to popularize the concept with a book edited by their China office and published by Tongji University Press, A Forest City . The book is scheduled to come out in April.\nThe Nanjing Towers are slated for completion in 2018.\n+ Stefano Boeri Architetti \nImages courtesy of Stefano Boeri Architetti \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:17:34.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
