That's the same price as last year's deal. \nFor an additional $20, Floridians can add a fourth day to the offer. This price applies to visitors ages 3 and older. \nThe deal can be turned into park-hoppers -- allowing the holder to visit more than one Disney World park per day -- for $27.50 on the three-day plan and for $34.50 with the four-day ticket. \nThe tickets can be purchased between now and June 5, and they must be used by June 9 at Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disney's Animal Kingdom. \nThis year, the tickets come with blockout dates for Animal Kingdom between May 27 and June 9. \nFor Discover Disney tickets, all adults must show proof of Florida residency at park entrances. \nThe normal price for a three-day Florida resident ticket, according to disneyworld.com, is $185, and the usual four-day Florida resident offer goes for $204 (although they come with more blockout dates). \nDisney has tinkered with the format and price of its early-in-the-year Florida resident offer over the years. In 2008, a four-day pass was $125. In 2009, it went with a pair of one-day, one-park passes for $99. \nIn 2010, Disney promoted a \"4 Day Dream Pass\" for $99, then raised the price to $119 in 2011. \nFour years ago, it dropped the offer to only three parks and dropped the price to $99. The price went to $119 in 2013 and then to $129 in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:43:47.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
