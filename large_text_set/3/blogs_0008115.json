The works are coming from the private collection of original artist Gerald Scarfe, and they include stuff created for the album, concerts, and film, like “The Scream” painting used for the film’s poster, an early version of the Mother character, and a sheet of storyboard art with a whole bunch of iconic images. (Image: Gerald Scarfe) \nThe sale is going through the San Francisco Art Exchange , and the organization’s website says the paintings will be sold individually or as a complete collection, and they’ll be give to “the first buyer to agree to price and terms.” That means this isn’t an auction, so if you want to get in on this you’ll have to be quick. Also, pricing is available “on request,” but if you actually have to request the price before deciding if you should buy any of this stuff, it’s probably way too expensive for you. \nYou can see full images of the artwork and find more information at this link .
