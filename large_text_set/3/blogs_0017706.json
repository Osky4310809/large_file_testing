The Eagles are back in the OHSAA Division I state semifinals for the third time in four years. \nAnd Flannery picked up his 400th win, too. \nIt took plenty for them to reach the milestone and cut down the nets Saturday night at Cleveland State’s Wolstein Center. St. Edward’s 69-65 overtime victory against Garfield Heights gives it a date with Massillon Jackson, one of the preseason favorites to reach Columbus, on Friday night at Schottenstein Center. \nJackson punched its ticket to the state final four with a 54-38 rout of Toledo St. John at the University of Akron. Cincinnati Archbishop Moeller and Pickerington Central will meet in the other semifinal. \nAll three ended the season ranked in The Associated Press top 10, except St. Edward (23-5). \nA rigorous schedule denied them that distinction, but it rewarded Flannery and what he calls a “group of misfits” with something they prefer: the chance to win St. Edward’s first state title since 2014. \n“It’s really taken a while for this group to jell and come together,” said Flannery, who starts three seniors and two freshmen. “It’s been a pleasure to be around. Year in and year out, it’s a different story and a different group of guys.” \nOn some nights, senior guards Tommy Schmock and Jack Sullivan carried the Eagles. Other games — such as their district championship win vs. St. Ignatius — came with boosts from freshman Grant Huffman and senior forward Kelvin Calhoun. \nAll played a role Saturday in fending off Garfield Heights (22-5), which rallied from a nine-point deficit in the fourth quarter to force overtime.

St. Edward quickly responded with a 9-0 run and took the lead on Calhoun’s three-point play in the paint. \n“It came down to a couple of those turnovers we had when we were up a couple of points in overtime,” Garfield Heights coach Sonny Johnson said. \nHis team fell short of a third straight trip to Columbus. Senior point guard Marreon Jackson, a Toledo recruit, led the Bulldogs with a game-high 27 points. Sophomore forward Brison Waller added 12 rebounds and supplied two free throws in the final 30 seconds that ultimately forced overtime. \n“We thought we were a final-four team,” Johnson said. “That’s what counts, and we played like it.” Marreon Jackson gave Garfield Heights a spark in the first half. pic.twitter.com/9P7HHreDa6 — Matt Goul (@mgoul) March 18, 2017 \nFlannery will take his final-four team to Columbus after Schmock led St. Edward with 17 points, Calhoun added 11 and Sullivan scored 10. \n“I am just so fired up and excited that these guys get to experience a final four,” Flannery said. \nSullivan watched St. Edward’s last two trips as a freshman and JV player. On Saturday, Flannery assigned the 5-foot-10 guard to Garfield Heights’ standout Shawn Christian. A year ago, Christian’s 3-pointer at the buzzer in regulation forced overtime vs. St. Ignatius. Sullivan shadowed the Cleveland State recruit and limited him to 10 points. \n“He’s really a key part in stopping them and taking away the 3-point line,” Sullivan said. \nOne of St. Edward’s outside shooters, Sullivan now gets to test the 3-point line at Ohio State. \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
