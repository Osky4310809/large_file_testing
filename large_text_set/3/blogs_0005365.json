It’s turned into a spooky place. \nIf you stay on the fun, careless side of the social media platform, you’ll be fine. But if you venture into the political side of Twitter, you just might stumble upon a bunch of trolls that’ll tear you to shreds for sharing your opinion. \nThat’s probably due to the tense atmosphere of American politics right now. \nWho is responsible for this mess, and why are there trolls defending it?! Giphy \nApparently, some of these vile “trolls” can even be official advisers to the president. Who knew?! That much was made clear after award-winning novelist JK Rowling clapped back at a rude Trump adviser named Roger Stone. \nIn true troll fashion, Stone obnoxiously lashed out at a Twitter user and called her an “ugly bitch.” \nA woman named Caroline asked the Trump adviser, \nDo you know what libel is, Mr. Stone? \nStone’s response? Well, it was certainly a rebuttal you wouldn’t except from someone who has the ear of the president of the United States in his possession (not literally, but imagine). \nUnfortunately for us, he actually said what he said, and JK Rowling caught it all. Giphy After Stone deleted his tasteless tweets, JK Rowling put the 64-year-old political consultant on full blast. Exposed! This man is an advisor to the leader of the free world. This guy, right here. #rogerstone pic.twitter.com/brxqZAfw09 \n— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) March 5, 2017 Rowling then took the fight straight to President Trump after he tweeted this . Who was it that secretly said to Russian President, \"Tell Vladimir that after the election I'll have more flexibility?\" @foxandfriends \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 5, 2017 She epically called him out regarding his alleged ties to Russia with a tweet of her own. 'OhmyGod I SO can't believe you think I'm in bed with Putin bcos there's this whole thing with Obama that you don't even know nothing about' https://t.co/YirRiuCVUv \n— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) March 5, 2017 \nI think JK Rowling made it very clear she will NOT tolerate bullshit on Twitter. Furthermore, the 51-year-old author shined a bright light on some of the filth currently advising Trump. \nIt’s certainly not a myth after all. Those tweets are cold, hard evidence! \nUgh, all of this JK Rowling talk is making me crave another “Fantastic Beasts” film. Rowling took to Twitter last week to hint at the upcoming sequel to the David Yates-directed “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” movie starring Eddie Redmayne . \nAll she said was, “Having a Beastly day…,” as she shared a photo of a screenplay. Having a Beastly day… pic.twitter.com/xRGCC9gt3B \n— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 27, 2017 \nWhile it looks like we’ll have to wait a little longer for the next movie, that shouldn’t be too hard to do if JK keeps distracting us by keeping Trump’s people in check on Twitter!
