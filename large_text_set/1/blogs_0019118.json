While “it makes sense to gradually reduce the level of monetary policy support,” the timing of the next interest-rate increase “will depend on how the economy actually evolves over coming months,” she said. \nAt their meeting in December, Federal Open Market Committee officials estimated they would raise borrowing costs by a quarter percentage point three times this year, according to their median projection. Yellen noted that “I and most of my colleagues” were expecting last month to increase the benchmark lending rate “a few times a year” through the end of 2019. \nThe dollar rallied while Treasuries plunged as investors absorbed her confident characterization of the U.S. economy and the outlook for further rate increases.

She said risks to financial stability in the U.S. were “moderate,” and the central bank is watching for new policies from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump and how they might change the Fed outlook.\nSpeaking of growth abroad, Yellen also said that her assessment was that global uncertainties “are a little bit less worrisome than they have been in recent years.” \nFed officials raised their benchmark borrowing cost to a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent last month, the first hike in a year. The move reflected “our confidence that the economy will continue to improve,” Yellen said. \nHer speech comes two days before Trump’s inauguration as president. His incoming team wants to boost growth through tax cuts, infrastructure investment and regulatory changes that they say could lift gross domestic product gains to 3 percent to 4 percent a year. That compares with an average of about 2 percent since the last recession ended in mid-2009. \nU.S. central bankers are bracing for what could be an economic regime shift. Earlier this week, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said fiscal policies that boost demand when the economy is already around full employment and 2 percent inflation are “relatively more likely to be accompanied by increases in interest rates.” \nYellen made no such assertion but did say the Fed will closely follow what happens with economic policy and “we will factor those into the outlook and take account of their impact on what we need to do to achieve our dual mandate objectives.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:44:41.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
