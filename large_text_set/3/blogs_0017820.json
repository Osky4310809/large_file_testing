One of it is quality and credibility of voter register; the voter register is central to election,” the INEC chief said. \n“After the 2015 general elections, we are compelled to see if we can clean up the voter register. For instance, we have to remove the names of the deceased from the register. \n“But this is easier said than done because sometimes you may know that the person is dead but the process of removing the name from the system is not that simple. \n“This is simply because in some cases we receive report that candidates involve in an election were dead only for them to turn up at the commission few days later to say it is a lie that they are alive.” \nHe said the commission was also working on modalities that would assist it in the distribution of uncollected 7.8 million Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) during the voter registration. \nNAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:36:27.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
