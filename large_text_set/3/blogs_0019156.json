A Phillies official confirmed Green’s death to the New York Daily News.\nDallas Green has passed away. Great baseball man. RIP.\n— Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) March 22, 2017 \n\nThe cause of Green’s death is unknown. He was 82.\nGreen spent parts of eight seasons as a major-league manager, including with the Phillies, whom he led to a World Series championship in 1980.\nHe was hired as the Mets manager in May 1993, taking over for the fired Jeff Torborg. Green managed the Mets until August 1996, going 229-283, but never reaching the postseason.\nIn 1989, Green was the victim of George Steinbrenner’s infamous quick hook, being fired in August of his only season as the Yankees manager. The Bombers were 56-65 at the time.\nGreen had an eight-year major league career, from 1960-67, as a pitcher with the Phillies, Washington Senators and Mets, going 20-22 with a 4.26 ERA.\nHe also worked in Philadelphia’s front office before becoming executive vice president and general manager of the Cubs in 1980s.\nGreen’s name found its way back into the news in 2011, when his 9-year-old granddaughter, Christina Taylor-Green, was killed in the 2011 Tucson shooting that wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:50:59.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
