After decades in a grey suit, the tech monolith is learning to loosen up and crack a smile. They’re embossing skulls on products, embracing gaming, and unlocking budget chips for hardware hot-rodding. This isn’t your father’s Intel. \nWhile critics have legitimate claims about the slow pace of processor development on the desktop, advancements in the chipsets and motherboards behind them are another matter. The jump in features, style, and performance from Z97 to Z270 has been dramatic and useful to enthusiasts of all stripes, far outstripping CPU advancements since Haswell. \nThe first wave of Z270 motherboards usher in multiple 32Gb M.2 slots, lanes a-plenty for SLI or Crossfire builds, subtle or changeable color schemes, commonplace usage of Realtek’s new ALC1220 audio codec, and a host of refinements to over-clocking. Mounts for 3D-printed add-ons are even starting to appear. \nMeanwhile, legacy ports are starting to disappear. USB 2.0 headers and back-panel connectors are getting swapped for 3.0 and 3.1 counterparts. SATA port counts are getting shaved to free resources and space for M.2 and U.2 storage. All the boards here feature at least a pair of M.2 slots, and all are full-speed, 32 Gb/s implementations. The days of SATA seem numbered. \nRemarkably, Intel chose to retain socket 1151 and provide backwards compatibility to Skylake. That’s right; Skylake processors will work in Z270 systems and Kaby Lake will work with Z170 motherboards after a BIOS update. Intel is definitely doing things differently. \nThis revitalized Intel arrives just in time for the first real desktop CPU competition in years. AMD’s Ryzen CPUs are finally here, and there’s a whole new platform and chipset arriving with them. Stay tuned for PCGamer’s AM4 Motherboard guide, coming soon! Best overall Z270 motherboard Best overclocking and memory scores Mild or wild, depending on how you tune the lights No Wi-Fi or Bluetooth \nThe midrange Maximus Hero IX lived up to its name during testing, taking on motherboards costing almost twice as much and frequently pulling ahead on performance or features, making it best overall pick for Z270’s first wave. \nGunmetal grey heatsink shapes and relatively restrained styling clothe this otherwise hardcore gaming product in upscale attire. Leave off the Aura lighting and you might assume it’s a workstation board. This neutral color scheme works well for extravagant rig builders too; just turn on the lights, match your colors, and you’re good to go, no matter what neon-colored components or cases you have in mind. \nHardware hobbyists will also find plenty to play around with. Subtly incorporated along the upper right and lower board edges are buttons for power, system reboot, memory reset, and BIOS entry, which are welcome additions when tinkering on a workbench. Extensive and well placed fan headers are backed by features such a flow tachometer for water cooling loops and ASUS’s in-depth BIOS fan control. \nWhat’s more, all this attention pays off with the highest multiplier and memory numbers among the boards tested here. The Hero IX managed a stress-free 5.1 GHz and pushed two-stick memory configurations beyond their rated 3600 MHz capacity. Further, post-benchmark BCLK testing raised that to almost 5.2 GHz without incident before heat became a factor. None of the other boards here came close, with the Hero even upstaging ASUS’s own, more expensive Formula IX. \nTen USB ports on the back I/O panel mean plenty of external connectors, but internal USB headers are limited to three; one of each generation. This means just a single USB 2.0 header, so system builders with water-cooled systems like Corsair’s H115i which require a USB header will need to plan ahead with either an internal USB expander or an adaptor cable for the USB 3 or 3.1 headers. \nThe onboard Intel v219 Ethernet LAN controller is a smart low-latency choice but Wi-Fi and Bluetooth would have been welcome additions for a product released in 2017. With Intel 7265 M.2 wireless modules under $20 online , leaving this feature off a premium motherboard that retails for over $200 seems like deliberate product segmentation, although MSI’s Z270 XPower is even more cynical since it retails for a cool $100 more and doesn’t have Wi-Fi or Bluetooth either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:29:51.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
