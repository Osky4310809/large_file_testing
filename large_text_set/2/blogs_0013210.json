Rand Paul (R-KY) on the Flynn affair : \"I just don't think it's useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party. We'll never even get started with doing the things we need to do, like repealing Obamacare, if we're spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. I think it makes no sense.\"\nThat was the same mindset – an aversion to accountability in exchange for perceived short-term political gain – that produced an explosion of GOP corruption in the mid-aughts. There's little evidence the party learned from that sordid period, and Trump seems likely to reproduce it, except bigger, more garishly, and with more conspicuous gilding. And his congressional enablers seem ready to help out, if only by omission of real oversight.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:11:40.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
