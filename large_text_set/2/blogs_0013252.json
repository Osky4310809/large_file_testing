The best of Twitter If Ozil had missed tht penalty,he wouldn't score again..Will just stood there with his lazy ass nd not bother..Difference btw him and Alexis Good from Sanchez tho.. he missed and reacted fast. Ozil would've stayed there looking at the sky \n—", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:26:52.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
