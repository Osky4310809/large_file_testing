Called the Mi Surge S1, the SoC has been developed in partnership with Pinecone. The SoC is manufactured using TMSC’s 28nm HPc fabrication technology, and will go against the likes of the Snapdragon 653 and Snapdragon 437, which also utilise the 28nm HPm process. \nXiaomi’s Surge S1 SoC has four Cortex-A53 cores ticking at 2.3GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.4GHz. The 2.2GHz octa-core SoC is mated to Mali-T860 MP4 graphics. It features big.LITTLE architecture for efficient usage of all the eight cores. The SoC supports eMMC 5.0 storage, Dual Channel LPDDR3 933MHz RAM, 14-bit dual ISP / up to 36-megapixel camera support, dual noise reduction algorithm, multi-shot optimisation and light sensitivity enhancement. \nThe Surge S1 SoC supports most audio formats and video playback up to 4K at 30 frames per second. It is capable of capturing 4K videos at 30fps, 1080p at 120fps and 720p at 240 fps. The processor supports device display up to 2,560 x 1,600 resolution. It also supports 9V/2A fast charging technology. \nThe Surge S1 is equipped with 32-bit DSP supporting VoLTE (voice over LTE) and 16kHz sampling. Xiaomi said that it took only 28 months to start the research and bring the processor to large-scale development. The Mi 5C, as we mentioned earlier, is the first smartphone to make use of this new chip. What remains to be seen is whether utilising its own chipset will help Xiaomi reduce prices of its smartphones further and make them even more affordable.
