Related Human See, Human Do: A Complete History of 'Planet of the Apes' From screaming Charlton Heston to Saturday-morning cartoons and summer-movie reboots, we trace the evolution of the simian sci-fi franchise \nIn the latest clip for Matt Reeves' third installment of the Planet of the Apes franchise, the tension and buildup to war mounts between Caesar, played by Andy Serkis , and the Colonel. \n\"I did not start this war. I fight only to protect the apes,\" says Caesar. Later he speaks of having offered peace and mercy, but the Colonel is unmoved. \"You talk about mercy,\" he says. \"No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us. That's the law of nature.\" \nThe dark visuals span forests and snow-covered landscapes, but interwoven scenes also depict soldiers on both sides preparing for battle. \n\"We are the beginning and the end,\" is the chant from the human soldiers. \"Apes, together, strong,\" is the counter response. \nThe trailer also features Nova (portrayed by Amiah Miller), a young girl who befriends the apes. The adult Nova was played by Linda Harrison in the original 1968 Planet of the Apes . Steve Zahn, Karin Konoval, and Terry Notary also co-star. \nWar for the Planet of the Apes opens on July 14th.
