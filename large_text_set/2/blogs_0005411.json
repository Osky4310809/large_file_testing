I was a little bit shocked when I found out.\" \nAlso wrapped up in the larger bag was a number of bags containing smaller amounts of the drug. \nThe worker said he believed the bag had dropped from a bag or pocket when someone walked through the grounds of the business sometime the night prior. \nThe man contacted Mount Gambier police, who are investigating the strange find. \nSenior Sergeant Chris King from Mount Gambier CIB said the 14 grams of methamphetamine equated to a rough street value of $7,000. \n\"Police are investigating and we would like to hear from anyone who may have any information regarding this find,\" he said. \nAnyone information to contact local police on 0887351020 or Crimestoppers on 1800 333 000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:11:51.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
