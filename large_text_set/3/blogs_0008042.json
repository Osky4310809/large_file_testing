But his messy split from the mother of his 18-month-old daughter threatens to overshadow the positive vibes created by his $1 million donation to the Chicago Public Schools.‚Äù. Mitchell goes on to make the assumption that if not handled correctly in the public eye Chance the Rapper‚Äôs image could take a hit. \nThis all comes after Chance‚Äôs announcement on Monday to donate $1million to Chicago Public Schools . Chance‚Äôs donation was a call to action after meeting with Governor Rauner of Illinois last week to talk about funding for the Chicago education system. In an interview after their meeting Chance said that Rauner gave him a lot of ‚Äúvague answers‚Äù. \nIn perfect fashion Chance the Rapper responded to Mitchell‚Äôs article with Kirsten and his 18-month daughter a video. The short video tweeted out by @theshaderoom has Chance reminding his fans not to worry about what critics are saying and ends the short video by saying ‚Äúsometimes get the f*ck back‚Äù. \nTwitter responded in by supporting Chance the Rapper and calling Mitchell into question. @Suntimes @MaryMitchellCST NO. He‚Äôs taking care of his child. This is misleading and a slander of @chancetherapper ‚Äòs character. üñïüèª \n‚Äî Kyle Hance (@KyleHance) March 9, 2017 The @Suntimes / @MaryMitchellCST hit-piece on @chancetherapper attempts to take the focus away from how the gov isn‚Äôt funding Chicago‚Äôs kids. \n‚Äî deray mckesson (@deray) March 9, 2017 Hey @MaryMitchellCST , do better. \nNext week the emcee will be the cover story on Complex .
