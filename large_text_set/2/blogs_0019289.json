My knowledge of the negative health effects mobile phones have on us had been quite limited up until only around a year ago. I assume most of you millenials and gen Y’s reading this sleep with your mobile phones either next to your head or just across the room. I remember my first Airplane Mode like it was yesterday. I had a particular interest in experimenting with optimsing my sleep and still do, and amongst the hacks I came across, placing your mobile in airplane mode when you go to sleep at night seemed to be quite ubiquitous amongst the health professionals I followed. I slowly applied the habit of switching to Airplane Mode before I went to sleep. It made sense to me at the time with the little knowledge I had, stopping the constant transmission to the cell tower. I did notice some subtle improvements in my sleep quality, so I decided to keep the habit up and do so to this day. As I continued with my studies and learnings around cutting edge health, my concerns and beliefs around the safety of mobile phones increased. I began to question and slowly change my habits. Through the copious health podcasts I consumed daily at a rapid rate, I came across neurosurgeon Dr. Jack Kruse. His work completely reshaped my worldview on health. I became a lot more curious and observant to my environment. I started out slow, I read a lot about not checking your phone or emails first thing in the morning to increase productivity and avoid getting into a reactive mode. I would wake up and do my lengthy morning routine (more of that in a future post) leaving my mobile in airplane mode the whole time. By this stage you probably don’t think I’m that bat shit crazy. So far it makes sense right? Turning your phone to airplane mode at night is not that big of a deal, if your health and sleep quality is of any concern to you. Becoming more and more educated around the science and physics involved, I learnt it is not recommended to keep your mobile in your pocket close to your body even when you are speaking on the phone, loudspeaker is the best option with a headset in at second. My curiosity continued to peak. I began to put my phone in Airplane Mode when I took my dog for a walk whilst listening to a podcast to avoid being exposed to the mobile radiation. Fast forward to today. For those who know me well, know I rarely answer my phone or reply on time to messages. This is because my mobile phone almost permanently lives in Airplane Mode these days, with around 5 times a day or so switching it across to check for any messages, updates etc. or if I really need to call someone. Now you think I’m bat shit crazy! That’s okay, you should see my phone bill and how damn productive I am. I also have my quantum health peers to back me up. I understand for a lot of you out there, this does not seem practical or even sustainable in this day and age, and it may not even be possible for some lifestyles. Heck, most of you may even think I’ve lost my god damn mind at 27 years old. A year ago I would have thought the same. As a human race we are becoming obsessed and allowing these portable smart computers to control us and negatively impact our psyche and biology. Wake up! Take control of your technology. Start off small and simple. Try putting your phone in Airplane Mode at night for a week and monitor your sleep. Maybe next time you are having coffee with a friend, flick it over to Airplane Mode and appreciate uninterrupted HUMAN contact. Become curious about your health and the effects your environment has on it, question your beliefs, and never stop growing.
