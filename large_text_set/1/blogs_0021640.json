The president also reaffirmed his promise that the Mexican government will cover the wall’s cost, even though Pena Nieto has repeatedly promised that his government will never reimburse America as Trump demands. \nPena Nieto was scheduled to meet with the Trump Administration next week, though recent reports indicate that he is thinking about canceling the visit. Pena Nieto also gave a speech last night, where he demanded respect for Mexico and once again rejected any intention to pay for the wall. \n“I regret and reject the decision of the United States to continue building a wall that, that for years, far from uniting us, divides us,” Pena Nieto said. “Mexico does not believe in walls. I have said time and time again, Mexico will not pay for any wall.” \nIt would seem that Trump noticed this, because he put out several tweets this morning indicating that if Mexico refuses to cough up, the meeting shouldn’t happen. The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers… \n— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2017 \nDuring an interview yesterday, Trump shrugged off Pena Nieto’s promise to never pay for the wall. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T18:35:50.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
