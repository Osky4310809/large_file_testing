View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “Opened the package and took it directly to the slow-draining, disgusting bathroom sink. Our drain-cover-stopper-thingy doesn’t come out, but this auger was still able to go in and pull out all. The. Nasty. All of it! Water now drains as normal and the teeth are still intact for another use.” — Tsm\nPrice: $6\nID: 10290932 2. Some dip clips so that you can eat on the couch without fear of spilling. View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “We use these all the time. Seemed like a gimmick when I purchased them. Nothing wrong with that, I love those kind of products! But they actually are very useful. They clip onto the edge of the plate so they don’t take up space. It’s easy to dip into them and they hold on well. I love that they keep the sauce from spreading onto the food.” — Jessica Hoppes\nPrice: $6\nID: 10291693 3. An adorable planner so that your life can be equal parts cute and organized. amazon.com Promising Review: “This planner is so cute!

The ‘pencil’ style provides more application control and precision, and the liquid liner goes on and stays on. You can also control the amount of product on the tip by shaking it. Absolutely love and highly recommend.” — Princess Kitten\nPrice: $9\nID: 10291008 5. A brush that’ll help you get those hard-to-reach places that never get clean.

Some The Princess Bride playing cards that you can play with as you wish. amazon.com Promising Review: “Bought this as a present for my mother (a big fan of both The Princess Bride and Kings in the Corner).

A prep tool that’ll make eating cauliflower a little less annoying. View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “This is so worth your money.

A container of charcoal for your teeth so that you’ll have a gleaming white smile. amazon.com , amazon.com Promising Review: “I’ve been using it for just over a week, once a day, prior to brushing with regular toothpaste in the morning. Of course it makes your mouth look like a horror show while you’re using it, but it’s easy to rinse or you can just do your regular brushing directly after. I noticed immediately that my mouth felt amazingly clean. After 24 hours, I noticed a huge improvement in my teeth sensitivity. After 72 hours, it was non-existent. So awesome! The photo is the difference in whitening after one week.” — Salem Webster\nPrice: $21\nID: 10290965 9. A tool to make eating avocado the easiest thing you do all day. amazon.com Promising Review: “I don’t like avocados. But I have been told that their benefits far outweigh the texture, that I dislike. Having this tool makes preparing them much easier. It really does just slice through the skin and makes it easy to discard the pit. So, thanks for making this tool.” — Laura Sue\nPrice: $8\nID: 10290979 10. A magnetic wristband that’ll hold all your nails and screws. View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “My husband is constantly doing home projects that require him to be on some sort of ladder nailing or screwing in things. I bought this for him as a stocking stuffer thinking it would be a fun gift that he could toss if it didn’t work. WOW! He LOVES this magnetic wristband. It works so well that it actually got stuck to something that was metal in his stocking! He said it is so helpful when he is on a ladder and needs to have his nails ‘right there’ without having to climb up and down.” — DisneyMom\nPrice: $13\nID: 10291004 11. An attachment for your bathtub that’ll let you fill up your tub to the very top. View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “I don’t like to take baths. Let’s just put that out there. However, I moved into an older home that had only a bathtub. After getting into the tub, I noticed that all of the top-level water drained right out through the overflow. It really disappointed me and made my bathing experience even more unpleasant, did I mention that I don’t like baths? I came across this on Amazon and ordered a couple (in case one got damaged). I immediately found that not only did I use this device, but so did every single other member of my family. They all fell in love with it! It allowed them to have a deeper soak in the tub. For those in the family that wanted a more therapeutic experience — these worked like a charm.” — Brent Paxton\nPrice: $10\nID: 10290983 12. A set of lip balm that tastes delicious and hydrates magnificently. amazon.com , amazon.com Promising Review: “Something magical happened on day three. I awoke to find that my cracked lips were no more! Though still a teensy bit dry, gone were the chunks of dead skin that once littered my lips! I was beyond thrilled. Rather than upping the number of times I applied my lip balm, I stuck with what had been working. By day five, my lips felt like that had their elasticity back and were no longer dry! I can’t recommend this product enough, especially for the price!” — Nick\nPrice: $11\nID: 10290981 13. A slicer that’ll give you the perfect cut every time. View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “Always wanted a mandoline slicer but most are terribly expensive. This was not only affordable but works amazingly. I slice up my onions and put them in a container to use through out the week. I did potatoes for an Au Gratin recipe and it was a snap. I love the push button to change out the blade sizes. And the veggie holder works wonderfully. I hardly loose any veggies.” — SUZANNE LIND\nPrice: $20\nID: 10290996 14. A Matcha mud mask that’ll naturally nourish your skin. amazon.com Promising Review: “We decided to give this product a try because we actually love drinking Matcha tea. The first thing I noticed is the fine texture of the mask. It has a very good and neutral smell. It was very easy to put on and wash off. My skin didn’t get oily or dry after usage.I have many red spots but even after the very first application, I could see a slight difference. The skin definitely felt much more smooth and clean.” — Dennis T.\nPrice: $20\nID: 10290984 15. A scratch and sniff book because you like the drinking part of being an adult, but that’s it. View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “I heard about this book from a sommelier and wine representative. It’s scratch and sniff for wine lovers. It breaks information down to the basics, but good basics. The book offers simple information, easy to understand, and offers colors and smells to help understand wine. It helps you identify things like green pepper and pear in the wine that might be missed. It’s also a lot of fun. I ended up buying four copies, gave away three as gifts, and kept one for myself.” — duskfall\nPrice: $12\nID: 10291014 16. A set of bento boxes that’ll make packing your lunch super easy.

A set of wash bags for your intimates so that you don’t have to hand wash them. View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “These are cleverly designed and work well for one or two bras. The provided laundry guide was interesting — I didn’t know inverting molded bra cups would shorten their life.” — J. Myers\nPrice: $13\nID: 10290991 19. A place for your glasses so that you’re never searching blind for them. View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “My husband and I got this for a friend for Christmas as a joke.

A mascara that’ll change your eyelash game. amazon.com , amazon.com Promising Review: “Honestly this is the best mascara I’ve ever tried and I’ve tried expensive products like Lancôme, YSL, MAC, and Chanel. None compare to this. Trust me and give it a try. It’s not flaky, not waterproof but stays on all day, does not smear, the thin bristles really get all your lashes, and it elongates them.” — Am\nPrice: $8\nID: 10290994 21. A book that even your dog will love. amazon.com , amazon.com Promising Review: “My dog really enjoyed the book. He thoroughly digested the information. Seriously though, the book was great.

View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “Great garlic press that takes little effort to get maximum results. Does a great job on garlic, but it is awesome at juicing Key Limes.

A primer that’ll make your makeup application so much easier. amazon.com , amazon.com Promising Review: “I was a bit hesitant to make the purchases because of the mixed reviews.

A spiral slicer so your fries can be a little more fun! amazon.com Promising Review: “I truly feel like this product is fool-proof. Put the raw vegetable or fruit on the pronged circle, push until the other end is against the silver metal piece, and begin spinning. Just make sure the feet are suctioned to the counter so it doesn’t move. There is very little waste and such an easy cleanup!” — Tiffany\nPrice: $23\nID: 10291007 27. An east-to-attach shelf that’ll give you that little extra bathroom space that you so desperately need. View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “There isn’t much to this product.

A notebook that’ll get you ready to start that bullet journal you always talk about. View this image ›\namazon.com Promising Review: “Excellent quality and a perfect size, this notebook is everything I hoped it would be for my first bullet journal.

A set of markers that’ll have you painting the town red, and blue, and yellow, and green. amazon.com Promising Review: “I’m not an artist in anyway but I recently got into adult coloring books. These give you a much deeper color versus gel pens. The brush tip is great for filling in large areas with the other tip allowing you to fill in smaller areas. Easy to blend to create many, many more colors than the 10 colors you get in the set.” — Nancy J.\nPrice: $13\nID: 10291011 30.

A spatula that’ll be the best damn spatula you didn’t know you needed. amazon.com Promising Review: “We’ve had these for a year now, and I love them every time I use them. I purchased these when I was looking to replace all of my wooden cooking utensils that weren’t looking so great.

I haven’t regretted my purchase at all in the past year, and these have quickly become our go-to cooking utensils.” — NJGR\nPrice: $7\nID: 10291643 32. A pair of sunglasses that’ll make you look stylish AF. amazon.com Promising Review: “These sunglasses exceeded my expectations.
