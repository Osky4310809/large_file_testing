(Photo: Twitter) More If you had the pleasure of growing up with a loving grandfather, this story will have you reaching for the tissues. Texas teen Lauren Blank was gifted with a series of journals from her grandpa, who wrote down a daily account of their times together from the time she was 2 until she was 5, on her 16th birthday last week. Blank, who goes by Ren, spoke with Buzzfeed News and shared how her grandpa surprised her with the series of journals on Mar. 22. Ren took to Twitter and posted about the journals, which featured images of the three books along with sharing some of the heartfelt writing inside. today for my birthday, my grandpa gave me 3 books filled w stories of each time he hung out w me from the age of 2 to 5. I am speechless.???? pic.twitter.com/fyeOUV1K2J \n— ren (@renblankk) March 23, 2017 Initially, he wanted these writings to be given to Ren after his death, but after speaking with Ren’s mom, it was decided that it’d be best to share the moment in real time. Ren was partly raised by her grandpa from a young age, so there was already a natural bond. But nothing could have prepared the teen for this awesome gesture of love. “The notebook is just filled with daily things that we did,” Ren shared. “We went to the zoo a lot, and flew kites, and throughout the notebooks he gave me advice.” Ren said that when her grandpa first gave her the journals, she was in shock as she had no idea that he had kept a running tab on their life together. At first, Ren said she didn’t cry but seeing the family melt at the gesture caused her to follow suit. A passage from the journal: “One of your favorite things is for me to push the button on your clock and do my silly dance. When I say ‘Lauren do it,’ you sit in your bed and say ‘papa’ and I keep dancing, falling, running into the wall, turning around like an uncoordinated fat ballerina, and you keep laughing.” Ren’s initial tweet went viral and enacted a flurry of reactions. A quick scan of her Twitter account also shows that she’s been retweeting stories that have popped since announcing the precious moment. Ren said that people have been reaching out to her and saying that they too want to get closer to their grandparents and appreciate them while they can. She also added that the journals were the greatest gift she’s ever received. There’s a particular draw to stories shared on the Internet about our elders. Last year, a slightly different story went viral when a college student in Oklahoma shared a picture of her grandfather “Papaw” looking sad after her cousins didn’t show up for a planned cookout. Now, can you please hand us some of those tissues now?
