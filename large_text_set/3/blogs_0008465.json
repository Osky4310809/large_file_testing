Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported the deal is a five-year contract worth $30 million. Remmers' agent, Brett Tessler, also confirmed the news. Mike Garafolo of NFL Network first reported a deal was close. In January, ESPN.com's David Newton speculated Remmers' days with Carolina may have been numbered: \nRemmers really wants to remain at Carolina. But at 27, this is his one and only chance at a big deal. The price tag could get too high for the Panthers if other teams look at him as a viable option at left tackle, where he played the final 13 games after Michael Oher went into the concussion protocol. Remember, Oher is under contract through 2019 and Daryl Williams proved he can handle the right tackle duties. The Panthers have a little over $57 million in salary-cap space available, per Spotrac , so they had plenty of financial flexibility to bring Remmers back if they preferred. Letting him walk in free agency isn't a bad move, though. Since becoming a full-time starter with Carolina in 2015, Remmers has been a liability. He wasn't solely responsible for the Panthers' Super Bowl 50 defeat to the Denver Broncos, but his inability to stop Von Miller off the edge was one of the game's deciding factors. Miller finished with 2.5 sacks, and Cam Newton 's fourth-quarter fumble came after Miller beat Remmers off the edge. The NFL shared a replay of the turnover: NFL @NFL VON MILLER CANNOT BE STOPPED He strips Cam Newton again & gives #Broncos incredible field position! #Broncos #SB50 https://t.co/kq5LVFAGB6 2/8/2016, 3:03:27 AM According to Football Outsiders , the Panthers ranked 25th in adjusted line yards and 19th in adjusted sack rate. There was a case Carolina could have made for bringing Remmers back. He has experience with its blocking schemes and can play at either tackle position. Those two traits would be valuable for a reserve lineman, assuming the Panthers would've given Remmers a limited role. Looking at the bigger picture, the team is better off looking for upgrades at right tackle. For too long, the front office hasn't done enough to properly address the offensive line. To a certain extent, re-signing Remmers would've shown the lack of ambition that has gotten the Panthers line to this point. Given his struggles the last two years, Remmers is a bit risky for Minnesota to bring on board. Limiting him to backup duties would mitigate some of that risk. The Vikings didn't break the bank on the move, though, so fans shouldn't expect him to play a key role. With the Vikings, Remmers will try to fortify a line that was in shambles throughout the 2016 season. Not only did the Vikings allow 38 sacks in 2016, but they finished the year ranked as Pro Football Focus' fourth-worst offensive line overall. With Riley Reiff also in the fold , Remmers should continue at right tackle, while the former Detroit Lions lineman figures to shift back over to left tackle.
