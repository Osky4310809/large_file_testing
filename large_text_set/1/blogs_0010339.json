BuzzFeed followed CNN’s report with a 35-page dossier full of as-yet unsubstantiated claims about Trump and his alleged ties to Russia. \nSome people may think this supposed bombshell could spell major trouble for Trump, but it’s important to note that he’s weathered plenty of scandal-y storms before today, and again, the claims made in the dossier have not been confirmed. You know who’s probably having a pretty bad time right now, though? President Obama. Our dearly departing POTUS is gearing up for his farewell address tonight, and now, instead of being front-and-center in Americans’ minds, he’s finding himself in Trump’s shadow. Again. You could not write this in a film script. The Trump stuff tumbling out at Obama readies his farewell speech. What a night. \n— Racheline Maltese (@racheline_m) January 11, 2017 Well, Trump found a way to bigfoot Obama's goodbye speech. \n— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) January 11, 2017 Obama's on stage trying to #onelasttime it up, and can't top trending for all the Golden Shower talk. Step aside, 2016, says 2017. \n— Mary Katharine Ham (@mkhammer) January 11, 2017 Obama gotta be totally bummed ..this is really raining on his day lol! I can't help it! \n— Red Pickle (@redsoutrage) January 11, 2017 Obama farewell address eclipsed by unsubstantiated reports of Trump's love of golden showers. I'm torn….. #TheResistance #DontPeeOnMe \n— Babbette Jablonski (@Nancyfourdogs) January 11, 2017 President Obama deserves so much better than to have his farewell address hijacked by news about Trump and his golden showers. \n— Andi Zeisler (@andizeisler) January 10, 2017 Dare I say, leave it to Trump to piss all over Obama's farewell speech night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T04:52:24.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
