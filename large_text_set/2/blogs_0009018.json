AP/File photo \nBAGUIO CITY, Philippines - Government security forces overran a rebel camp in remote Asipulo town in Ifugao Sunday evening following clashes with rebels. \nThe Philippine Army’s 54th Infantry Battalion said that a soldier, whose name was withheld, was slightly wounded in the left knee during a gunfight with communist rebels at Sitio Timmapaya, Barangay Namal, Asipulo at around 6 p.m. Saturday. \nWhen the gun smoke cleared after the firefight, soldiers found a camp of the Nona del Rosario Command of the Ilocos-Cordillera Regional Committee (ICRC) at Sitio Pinugao, Barangay Namal. \nSoldiers also seized a caliber Cal 5.56mm M16 assault rifle, including three laptop units, a printer, a Honda 1000w power generator, six long magazines for AK-47 assault rifle, two long magazine for M16 rifle, two rifle grenades, a roll of undetermined length of detonating cord, several pieces of blasting caps, assorted medical and food supplies and other personal belongings. \nGovernment forces believed the rebels were caught unaware when the soldiers, who were tipped by civilians of their presence, approached the rebel encampment. \nArmy Lt. Col. Nicolas Quemado Jr, commanding officer of the 54th Infantry Battalion appealed to the rebels to let their wounded comrades be treated by them.   \n“We are appealing to the rebels to help us help their wounded comrades. They can tap the soldiers or leave their wounded members in the community for them to be evacuated by helicopters,” said Quemado. \n“Our differences should not stop us from helping each other. After all, we are all Filipinos,” Quemado added. \nRebels reportedly fled towards Mt.Capan in the village with their supposed wounded comrades.
