The Friends cast negotiated for equal pay (Photo: Reuters) \nWhen Friends started it was an ensemble show so the six main stars were paid an equal $22,500 an episode. \nThen as the show became a hit and Rachel and Ross's will-they-won't-they relationship became a crucial plot - Aniston and Schwimmer began to earn more. \nBut the cast - who also formed a strong bond in real life - didn't like the inequality in their pay. \nSo when it came to negotiating salaries for series three - they negotiated not as individual actors but as an ensemble, led by Schwimmer and Kudrow, according to Entertainment Weekly .

The stars were paid $1million an episode by the last series (Photo: Wenn) \nBig Bang's five original cast members on the show - Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Kaley Cuoco, Kunal Nayyar and Simon Helberg - now earn around $1million per episode. \nAnd with negotiations for the final two seasons of Big Bang drawing to a close, reps Melissa Rauch and Mayim Bialik are said to be pressing for the studio to add some more coin to their paychecks as well, reports Variety. \nBialik and Rauch both joined the show in season three and have earned significantly less than their co-stars.

The three girls currently earn different salaries (Photo: Channel 4) Bernadette has become a crucial character (Photo: Channel 4) \nBialik's Amy Farrah Fowler is the girlfriend of Parsons' Sheldon Cooper, a relationship that has added emotional depth to the show. \nRauch's Bernadette Rostenkowski had a baby earlier this season with Helberg's Howard Wolowitz's character, which provided another source of highly rated episodes. Bialik has nabbed four consecutive supporting actress Emmy noms from 2012-15.
