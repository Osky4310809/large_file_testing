The spacious kitchen features stainless steel appliances and a large center island and breakfast counter. The bathrooms and bedrooms also appear to have gotten a thorough makeover since the four-bedroom home last sold in 2010.\nThe home’s owner tells Curbed that it has an interesting backstory. According to neighbors, it was the longtime residence of Hollywood screenwriter John Howard Lawson. The first president of the Writer’s Guild of America, Lawson is best known as a member of the “Hollywood Ten,” a group of film industry professionals blacklisted during the McCarthy-era.\nThe home itself is situated on a 10,669-square-foot lot, with a large backyard that offers terrific views across the hills. Other features include a front yard with drought-tolerant landscaping, a front porch and multiple decks, and outdoor access from nearly every room in the house.\nAsking price is $1.089 million.\n948 Elyria Drive [Kareen Slajer | Keller Williams] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T03:37:17.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
