Well, we’re here to throw some shade on your spring sunshine (cue the Debby Downer sad trombone). \nNo MLB team is without its faults, not even the defending World Series champions, who won 103 games last regular season and finished 17.5 games ahead in their division. A case can be made for all 30 teams falling short of the ultimate goal this season. (And because injuries are both unpredictable and an easy way out, we aren’t using that as an excuse for any team.) \nSo here’s the bad news for every team: USA TODAY Sports Rick Scuteri Angels \nThe improved lineup will be betrayed by the not-improved rotation. USA TODAY Sports Rick Scuteri Astros \nThe hitting won’t be able to compensate for the disappointing pitching. USA TODAY Sports Jasen Vinlove Athletics \nTheir next wave of talented young starting pitchers isn’t polished enough. USA TODAY Sports Kenny Karst Blue Jays \nThe opposition will pitch around Josh Donaldson, and no one will make them pay. USA TODAY Sports Dan Hamilton Braves \nThe veteran rotation additions actually will set back the rebuild. USA TODAY Sports Reinhold Matay Brewers \nThey’re in the wrong Central division to simultaneously rebuild and contend. USA TODAY Sports Rick Scuteri Cardinals \nEven with Dexter Fowler, the reliance on the long ball and lack of athleticism is glaring. USA TODAY Sports Steve Mitchell Cubs \nThe aging rotation – minus Jason Hammel – shows the wear and tear of all those innings in 2016. USA TODAY Sports Rick Scuteri Diamondbacks \nThe bullpen is where plenty of leads will go to die. USA TODAY Sports Mark J. Rebilas Dodgers \nThe bridge to Kenley Jansen proves to be far from stable. USA TODAY Sports Mark J. Rebilas Giants \nIn addition to being an odd-numbered year, the middle relief again springs some costly leaks. USA TODAY Sports John Hefti Indians \nAll those innings take a toll on all those pitchers (see: Astros, 2016). USA TODAY Sports Mark J. Rebilas Mariners \nEven after all those trades, they still need another starter and a right fielder. USA TODAY Sports Jennifer Buchanan Marlins \nEdinson Volquez, Dan Straily and Jeff Locke aren’t the answers. USA TODAY Sports Steve Mitchell Mets \nTurns out that all those starting pitchers aren’t simultaneously Tom Seaver – even when healthy. USA TODAY Sports Jasen Vinlove Nationals \nThe failure to acquire a proven closer is as damaging as many fear. USA TODAY Sports Steve Mitchell Orioles \n\"Chris Tillman and the Question Marks\" actually becomes an accurate nickname for the rotation. USA TODAY Sports Nick Turchiaro Padres \nThere’s a reason no one ever said that “corner infielders win championships” – though that’s where San Diego is strongest (Wil Myers, Yangervis Solarte). USA TODAY Sports Brett Davis Phillies \nJeremy Hellickson and Clay Buchholz aren’t Cliff Lee and Cole Hamels. USA TODAY Sports Eric Hartline Pirates \nShuffling three stud outfielders is a luxury, but shuffling countless back-of-the-rotation starters is a shell game. USA TODAY Sports Jonathan Dyer Rangers \nThere’s too much of a rotation drop-off after Cole Hamels and Yu Darvish. USA TODAY Sports Jerome Miron Rays \nEven if there are no more trades, the talent level doesn’t match up in the division, let alone the league. USA TODAY Sports Kim Klement Reds \nThe rotation and/or bullpen remains likely to surrender the rare lead it’s given. Cincinnati Enquirer via USA TODAY NETWORK Sam Green Red Sox \nThe young hitters slump, and there isn’t a productive enough veteran to compensate. USA TODAY Sports Kim Klement Rockies \nExpectations for the young starters are roughly a mile too high. USA TODAY Sports Matt Kartozian Royals \nThe bullpen – once the team’s biggest strength – becomes its biggest weakness. USA TODAY Sports John Rieger Tigers \nThere won’t be enough rainouts/off days to allow Justin Verlander and Michael Fulmer to combine for 80 starts. USA TODAY Sports Reinhold Matay Twins \nEven the Cubs endured a frustrating rebuild; check back in 2020 or so. USA TODAY Sports Patrick Gorski White Sox \nThe veteran sell-off – though temporarily on hold – is far from over. USA TODAY Sports Jordan Johnson Yankees \nIt’s Masahiro Tanaka and no one else when it comes to reliable starters.
