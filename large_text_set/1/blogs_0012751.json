Ahmad-Lawan \nHe said: “The 8th Senate started on a shaky foundation. This Senate will end on a solid, stable and successful foundation. On the part of the SUF, we were never personal, we only felt that what ought to have been done was not done and if there is compliance now, there will be no animosity.” \nAddressing journalists, Lawan, who disclosed that he had no knowledge of his party and Senate decision to replace him with the immediate past Senate Leader, Ali Ndume, said what took place was an act of God, just as he called on his colleagues to cooperate with him in his new assignment to deliver the dividends of democracy to Nigerians. \nHe further called on his colleagues on the need for collaboration to make life better for Nigerians by improving on security and ensuring economic growth. \nThe Senate had on Tuesday adopted the change in the leadership of the APC in the red chambers as it affirmed the replacement of Senator Ndume with Senator Lawan as the Senate Majority Leader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T08:21:16.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
