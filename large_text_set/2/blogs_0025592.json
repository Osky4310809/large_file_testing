I do think all those things played into it.\" American Airlines said Sadri was kicked off for \"not following instructions\" (Photo: Getty) \nSadri was escorted off by security and put onto the next flight to New York which was an hour later. \nAmerican Airlines told the Daily News in an email that Sadri was removed \"for not following crew members’ instructions.\" \nThe airline declined to comment further.
