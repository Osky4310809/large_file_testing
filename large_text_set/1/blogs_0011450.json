The mother attempted CPR, but J’Zyra was unresponsive and the burns were too severe. The toddler had died before her mother found her.\nThree other children were left alone in the apartment that night along with J'Zyra. They were all under 5 years old, and two of them were 3 years old.\nThe 3-year-old siblings told investigators with Texas Child Protective Services (CPS) that one of them had put their sister in the oven and the other one had turned it on, according to court documents obtained by KTRK. The toddler was reportedly kicking the doors of the oven as she was burned.\nPolice say that J’Zyra was left alone with her siblings while their mother and her boyfriend went out without telling their grandmother, who lives in the same Houston apartment complex. The mother and her boyfriend reportedly left to get pizza and to pick up a prescription.\nCPS now has custody of the other three children, and they are currently in foster care.\nCharges have not yet been filed against the parents, though criminal charges are expected.\n“There are concerns that the children were often left home alone and without adult supervision,\" CPS spokeswoman Estella Olguin told Daily Mail in an email. \"CPS had prior involvement with the mother and he children,.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:57:19.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
