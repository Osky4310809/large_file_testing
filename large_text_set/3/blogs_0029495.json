Bush Opens Up After Trump Election: ‘He Should Stop Saying Things That Aren’t True’ by Jon Levine | 6:44 am, March 27th, 2017 \nFormer Florida governor and presidential candidate Jeb Bush opened up about Donald Trump last week, sitting for an extensive interview with local Florida journalist Jim DeFede . The interview was filmed on the program Facing South Florida before it became clear that the Republican Obamacare replacement would fail. \nIn a wide ranging discussion, Bush offered a mix of resignation and advice for the 45th President. \n“He hasn’t shifted to being president in the way people are used to,” noted Bush. “He should stop saying things that aren’t true that are distractions from the task at hand.” \nWhen DeFede asked whether Trump’s constant broadsides against his predecessor “diminished” his office, Bush said yes. \n“When you’re the president, your words have consequences,” said the former Florida governor. \nFor Bush, the last 18 months have been an exercise in humility.
