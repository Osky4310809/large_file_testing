Image: ABC/Angus Young \nLucifer introduced the Devil’s mother at the start of season two; now, it appears we’ll soon be meeting dear old Dad. Sorta. The very funny Timothy Omudson (Galavant, Psych) has just signed on for a guest-starring role as God. With a twist, though. Advertisement \nSee, he’ll be playing God Johnson —a psychiatric patient who believes he’s the God. As the show has demonstrated with Lucifer’s mother, deities can come to Earth and take over any recently-deceased body they happen to come across. So of course Lucifer doesn’t recognize the guy on sight, though he starts to wonder if maybe God Johnson is the real deal once he investigates further. There was an episode back in season one in which Lucifer took great offense to a Satanic church operating in Los Angeles, so it’ll be interesting to see how he reacts to someone impersonating (or not?) his father. \nThe episode, appropriately titled “God Johnson,” airs in May, after the Fox show’s hiatus that’ll begin after the January 30 episode. Unfortunately, there’s no word on whether or not Omudson will sing, though given Lucifer’s fondness for piano ballads, there’s always a chance.
