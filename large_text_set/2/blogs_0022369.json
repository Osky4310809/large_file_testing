Quiggan said that the motion’s author should be asked, “Is it Islamophobic to say that women might not enjoy being beaten,” after citing Muslim literature that advocated wife-beating. \nQuiggan said the Quebec City mosque shooting was a “clear failure of intelligence” because the targeted congregation had received threats prior to the fatal event. With that tragedy, Quiggan said, “the cycle of violence has come to Canada”— with terrorist organizations raising money, indoctrinating agents and ultimately breeding more violence and death. \nIn a question and answer session, Raza contradicted one member of the audience who termed radical Islamic terror as “delicate issue,” saying, “It is an important, not a delicate issue. It has an aura of delicacy around it because of political correctness.” \nFollow David on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:13:43.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
