Image copyright AP Image caption The appeal court ruling means visa holders from seven countries, including this three-year-old from Yemen, can enter the US again \nSpeaking on Fox News Sunday , Mr Miller accused the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the block on Mr Trump's order, of \"overreaching\". \nHe also told ABC's This Week : \"We have equal branches of government in this country. The judiciary is not supreme.\" \nUnder the US system of checks and balances, courts can declare laws, or acts by the president, unconstitutional. \nMore on this story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:23:39.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
