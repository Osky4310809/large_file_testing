University Chancellor Joe Gow explained the termination by claiming that Dearman had other “performance issues” before she made the “racist statement.” \n“This racist statement was kind of the final act. This person is not a quality employee,” Gow said, according to Wisconsin Watchdog. However, he could not provide specifics. \nOn Wednesday, the university backed down. Dearman’s attorney, Lee Fehr, told Wisconsin Watchdog in an email Thursday that, “Late (Wednesday) UWL admitted they wrongfully terminated her position.” She was offered her job back, but it was unclear whether she still wants it.   \nThe reason the school re-offered Dearman employment? According to Wisconsin Watchdog, the school’s legal counsel told officials they couldn’t just fire an employee on such a ridiculous basis. \nThe firing drew such widespread attention that Dearman appeared for an interview Thursday on Fox News’“Tucker Carlson Tonight.” \nSchool officials could not have been happy that their actions garnered such national attention.
