Are you sure?' [Chuckles] \n\"My oldest son was a great drummer from a young age, he was really good. He was playing on my [electronic] V-Drums, and then I bought him a real drum set for Christmas and he just stopped - cold turkey, just stopped. [Chuckles] Now they're into sports, I don't think I have to worry about them wanting to be in the music world.\" \nMark added: \"I want them to follow their passions. I don't think anybody succeeds in life unless they follow the path they wanna go down. \n\"If you force them in any direction, it's just not gonna work. You gotta follow what you're passionate about and that's what I did when I was a kid - all I wanted to do is music. I just had this false sense of, 'This is what I'm gonna do for the rest of my life,' and it worked out. \n\"It's what I always wanted to do and what I chased. I want my kids to feel the same about whatever paths they take.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T05:27:09.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
