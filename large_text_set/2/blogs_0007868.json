Nearly a quarter of those babies need surgery, some of which are complex or can’t be repaired and require a heart transplant.\nStarting local and small, Yellow Brick Road is on its way to become nationally-known, because of the Flynns’ dedication to their cause.\nYellow Brick Road Foundation donates wagons to Pediatric Cardiovascular ICU Trey & Nicole Flynn founded Yellow Brick Road after their son Holden passed from congenital heart disease. Their goals include donating wagons to pediatric hospitals. The wagon was a favorite for Holden, since with it he could leave his hospital bed.

The foundation has donated several wagons to Orlando’s three children’s hospitals and is working on raising funds to donate more to other hospitals.\n“We’re excited about what we’ve done so far,” said Flynn in an interview.\nFor more information, visit ybrf.org .\nnmiller@orlandosentinel.com , 407-420-5158, @naseemmiller\nSign up for the weekly Health Report newsletter »\nVisit the Vital Signs health blog »\nMore local health news headlines »\nCaption CDC updates vaccine guidelines for flu, HPV and more A immunization committee for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control released its 2017 advisory for recommended shots affecting adults.
