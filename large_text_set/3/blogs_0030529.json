The annual taco food festival is among the best (and most sought-after) events in the city, bringing in well over 100 vendors each year to sling their best tacos in a variety of categories. Seriously, there are trophies and everything. Much like in years past , the Bill Esparza-curated lineup includes a ton of hometown heroes as well as local restaurants that don’t normally play the traditional taco game, but get into the mix for Tacolandia. And then there are the out of towners, those primo purveyors from far flung cities coming in just for the fun of it. This year’s lineup includes killer options like Tacos Kokopelli and seafood favorite La Cahua Del Yeyo from Tijuana, plus out-of-the-box names like Chinese-American restaurant Fat Dragon, South LA staple All Flavor No Grease, and relative newcomer White Boy Tacos. You can find the full list of options here . Tacolandia returns to El Pueblo de Los Angeles in Downtown from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday, June 17. Presale tickets go on sale tomorrow , with general ticket sales launching April 3. General admission is $45, with VIP (including a separate entrance, access to a private bar, all that good stuff) tickets running $65.
