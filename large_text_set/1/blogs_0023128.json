After that I try to find the best balance for the team.\" \nWalcott celebrated in reserved fashion after downing his boyhood club, who he will be firmly behind when they visit Wembley in the first showpiece final of the season next month. \n\"Southampton tend to be our bogey side but from the word go we were ready,\" the England winger said. \n\"We came out of the blocks running and Danny Welbeck came back with a bang. \n\"We created a lot of chances and it was nice to have the clean sheet. \n\"Southampton will always be in my heart I have some great memories here, they are a strong team and I will cheer them on in the EFL Cup final.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T00:26:08.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
