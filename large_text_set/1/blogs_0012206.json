He was in a heated back-and-forth with CNN’s Jim Acosta and tore into BuzzFeed over the news outlet publishing a dossier containing unverified allegations against him. \nMany in the press have expressed concerns about Trump’s treatment of reporters, but Sean Hannity ‘s reaction is indicative of how a lot of Trump’s own supporters view what happened today: @realDonaldTrump WOW! A total beatdown of the alt radical left mainstream media. I said in 08'\"Journalism is dead\". Now it's buried!! \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 11, 2017 \n(Hannity has recently taken to using the phrase “alt radical left” in response to the rise in usage of “alt-right,” particularly in reference to the mainstream media.) One has to wonder if @donnabrazile and @CNN , who both colluded with @HillaryClinton , gave the talking points on fake news yesterday. Wow!! https://t.co/wWXXz6Nwyi \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 11, 2017 \nHannity has also publicly called on Trump to reevaluate the traditional relationship between the White House and the press corps once he takes office. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:28:58.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
