Lianne McLeod Updated December 17, 2016 . \nPopular as pets, bearded dragons or \"beardies\" are moderately sized lizards native to Australia. While they are generally considered good pets , even for beginner reptile owners , they do have fairly complex nutritional and environmental requirements. Special equipment and a fair amount of time is needed to care for bearded dragons properly. However, they are social and easy to tame and handle and they show a range of fascinating behaviors that make them interesting to watch. \nNames: Bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps, central bearded dragon, inland bearded dragon \nSize: 16 to 24 inches long \nLifespan: 6-10 years is common but up to 20 years is documented About Bearded Dragons \nAlthough several other species are becoming available to the pet trade , the most commonly available variety is the central or inland bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps . This species is native to arid, rocky areas of Australia, and is typically tan/brown in coloration (several color morphs are also available). Their name is derived from the spines that line their throats. These spines usually lie flat but if the dragon feels threatened the throat is expanded causing the spines to stand up, making the dragon look more intimidating (especially combined with their tendency to flatten their bodies to appear wider). However, bearded dragons are generally docile and their aggressive displays are rarely seen in captivity which makes them very popular pet reptiles. Virtually all bearded dragons available in America are captive bred, as Australia has strict laws against exportation of it's wildlife. Housing Bearded Dragons \nFor a single adult bearded dragon a 55 gallon tank is ideal and a secure screen top cover will also be necessary. Smaller tanks can be used for juveniles. \nSubstrate is a hotly debated area of bearded dragon care. For juveniles, any loose substrate including sand should be avoided, as there is too great a risk of ingestion (either accidentally while eating or out of curiosity) and subsequent intestinal impaction. Paper towels, papers, or indoor/outdoor carpeting can all be used (make sure there are no loose threads on the carpeting) instead of sand. For adults, washed play sand (available at hardware stores, not fine silica sand) can be used if desired, although paper or indoor/outdoor carpet works fine too. Do not use wood shavings, corn cob , walnut shell, or other substrates that could cause problems if swallowed. If sand is used, feces can be scooped out with a cat litter scoop and the cage can be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected several times a year. Sand also doubles as an enrichment tool allowing your bearded dragon to dig and burrow. \nBearded dragons are semi-arboreal and like to perch a little bit off the ground. A selection of sturdy rocks, half logs, and branches can give them something to climb on, especially in the part of the tank used as a basking area. There should also be a hide (or two, one at each end of the temperature gradient) for your bearded dragon to escape into. \nEdited by Adrienne Kruzer, RVT Prev", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T05:29:14.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
