Jason Allen Carlson, with the Ely police department, was indicted on charges of third-degree criminal sexual conduct for admitting to having sexual relations with an underage girl. It took over two years, but in January, the officer pleaded guilty. However, because of his blue privilege, Carlson will not see a single day in jail — and, as we’ve just learned, he’ll receive severance pay from the department. \nCarlson, who was described in court as an acquaintance to the girl’s parents, admitted to breaking the law. He admitted to taking the girl, against all department policy, on ride alongs with him. She wasn’t even old enough to drive yet. \nDuring the indictment, Carlson also admitted to having sex with the child. \n“I engaged in sexual contact with an individual who was at least 16 but had not reached the age of 18,” Carlson stated in a plea petition. “I knew I could not do so.” \nBecause Carlson was in a position of authority, his acts with this child were that much worse, as she could’ve been intimidated into the relationship. According to the Duluth News Tribune, a St. Louis County grand jury in October 2015 indicted Carlson on a felony third-degree criminal sexual conduct charge, alleging that he was in a “position of authority” over the victim. \nCarlson’s case was set for trial in January. However, due to the fact that cops across the country, who admit to vile acts, even with children, are given special privileges by the court system, Carlson entered into a plea deal. St. Louis County prosecutor Gary Bjorklund then reduced the charge to misconduct of a public officer.

But it gets worse. \nCarlson, who’s been on paid vacation for over two years since admitting to having sex with a minor — was not even fired. \nEarlier this month, the Ely police department, with the blessing of the city council, allowed Carlson to quietly resign — and agreed to pay him $15,000 as part of the resignation deal. \nImagine for a moment that a person works in the civilian sector and is arrested and charged for having sex with a minor. Of course, everyone is innocent until proven guilty — so, they may not be fired right away. However, once they were indicted after admitting to the charge, what are the odds that a private company would allow an admitted child sex offender to collect a paycheck — for two more years — and then receive severance pay? \nNot only would that person have been immediately fired, but they would have been convicted much faster, and they would be in jail right now. \nHowever, because Carlson wears a badge, this 11-year veteran of the Ely police department will likely use his newfound windfall of cash to relocate to another department — and do the same thing all over again. After all, he gets to act out his sexual desires with high school freshmen and then gets insanely long paid vacations.
