AFP Westmincom, file \nMANILA, Philippines - The military has launched a new operation against the Abu Sayyaf in Basilan led by Isnilon Hapilon, who is also considered as the leader of the Islamic State (IS) in the country. \nArmed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief Gen. Eduardo Año said the Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) is acting on President Duterte’s orders to neutralize the terrorist group. \n“The operation has started. We will intensify it. Our target is still Hapilon, who is still in the area,” Año said. \nHe said the six-month target to defeat the Abu Sayyaf is a self-imposed timeline, noting the AFP assesses its campaigns every six months. \n“But our order to our troops is to intensify operations and as soon as possible we should reduce or eliminate the Abu Sayyaf,” Año said. \nDuterte has ordered the military to hunt down Hapilon. Nation ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \n“The Sulu-based Abu Sayyaf is focused on kidnapping activities and the Basilan group under Hapilon on assimilating the IS. As I predicted, the IS would find its way to the Philippines,” Duterte said during a gathering of the Philippine Military Academy Alumni Homecoming on Saturday. \nHe said Hapilon was wounded during a recent encounter with government security forces. \n“I have directed the AFP and the PNP to continuously contain the IS threat through intensified operations using all available assets and resources. This is the only way to secure Mindanao,” Duterte said, referring to the Philippine National Police. \nAño said the military’s continuous operations against the Abu Sayyaf and Maute group was meant to pressure the enemy and reduce their capacity and will to fight. \nTwo months into the six-month timeline to defeat the terror group, Año said troops on the ground are making progress. \n“They are motivated and they are really doing their job even beyond the call of duty,” he said. \nAño said the support given by the general headquarters to the operating units, including the additional funds approved by the President, is boosting the AFP’s morale and capability.
