Chiron must deal with emotional scars from his drug-addicted mother, while facing betrayals from friends, bullying from schoolmates, and coming to terms with his sexuality. The film is based on the play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarell Alvin McCraney. \nMahershala Ali played Juan, whom the young protagonist Chiron encounters early in his youth. Juan teaches Chiron a powerful lesson about friendship and disappointment. \n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9NJj12tJzqc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nAli's indelible performance was singled out by critics as especially affecting and impactful. \nIn his accpetance speech, Mahershala said: \"I wanna thank my teachers, my professors... so many wonderful teachers. One thing that they consistently told me… was that it wasn’t about you, it’s not about you, it’s about the characters. You’re in service to these stories, these characters… it’s about Juan, it’s about Chiron, it’s about Paula. Cast and crew, it was such a wonderful experience… I have so many people to thank who have gotten me here… any one of them [the cast] could be up here now holding this trophy.\" \nHe also thanked his wife, who just had a daughter 4 days ago and was on her 3rd trimester during awards season. \"I just wanna thank her for being such a soldier through this process,\" said Mahershala. \nMahershala beat Michael Shannon ( Nocturnal Animals ), Jeff Bridges ( Hell or High Water ), Dev Patel ( Lion ) and Lucas Hedges ( Manchester by the Sea ). – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
