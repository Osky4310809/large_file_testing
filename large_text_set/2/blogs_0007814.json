There’s a little bit of everything: strength, endurance, cardio, and plyometrics. All that activity with no rest between exercises means you’ll be knocking out body fat. \nThe box jump will improve your athleticism, while chinups will test your upper body strength, endurance, and grip. The landmine single-leg straight-leg deadlift will work your core, hamstrings, and glutes while taking stress off your lower back in comparison to a conventional deadlift.
