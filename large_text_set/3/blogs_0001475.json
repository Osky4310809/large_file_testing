This time it is Jamie Kilstein. Kilstein has been an outspoken advocate for social justice and secularism. He is also a stand up comedian and co-host of the popular Citizen Radio podcast. Once the abuse allegations came to light, Kilstein stepped down from the podcast. Allison Kilkenny, the other host of Citizen Radio and Kilstein’s wife, made the following comment : \nAbout Jamie’s departure from Citizen Radio: Recently, some disturbing allegations have been brought to my attention entailing several women who have accused Jamie of being manipulative, emotionally abusive, and predatory in his behavior. There had been murmurs of this in the past, but understandably, the women wished to remain anonymous, so I was never able to learn the full scope of what happened until very recently (a couple days ago). I want to be careful with what I say here because I don’t want to reveal anyone’s identity until they’re ready to speak publicly, but one of the victims was someone who worked for the show. Now that I have the full story, I am deeply upset and disturbed by what I’ve learned. This is why I asked Jamie to leave the show (he agreed) and why he’s agreed to seek therapy. I also wanted him to publicly post about what he’s done and apologize, but he declined to do that. I also wanted to be very clear in the episode title and description why he was leaving the show. He declined. \nSo I’m posting here instead. \nWithout making this about me, I want you all to know I’m furious, crushed, and horrified by all of this. I always believed Citizen Radio was a genuinely safe space, and I’m trying to make it that way again. \nI’m so, so sorry for letting anyone down. Several women have come forward that they were victims from Kilstein’s predatory behavior: This is really depressing news as too many outspoken male feminists turn out to be abusive towards women. Perhaps these men really were just using feminism as a way to get with women. Or they eventually felt like they could do no wrong after receiving a lot of praise for being a male feminist. Whatever the reason, I definitely understand when women are skeptical of men who loudly proclaim how feminist they are. I hope the victims from Kilstein’s abusive behavior receive the support they need.
