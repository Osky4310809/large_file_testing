The phrase gets a horrible rap for apparently being the brainless carrier of stereotypes. We all know certain people who act like enjoying a romantic comedy of this type, is worse than savouring a film advocating the benefits of necrophilia. If one analyses the rationale behind this attitude, it is quite clear that this is not about the quality of cinema, or the acting prowess of the talent. It has everything to do with qualities considered too “feminine”, and how everything associated with that is lowly and full of hormones. \nSource \nThere are people who are sure to socially slaughter you for being excited about watching Bridesmaids with your girlfriends. To them, the whole idea of a film with more women than that one token female lead, is disgusting. A film with that many women, pink lettering on the poster, and “feminine ideas” like romance, is sure to be directed at women. And we all know that everything catering to women must be silly, frivolous, and lame. It’s so much better to just watch a film with bad VFX, car chases, terrible acting, and oversexualised young women. That’s quality cinema, not “chick flicks.” \nSource \nThey will ask, “What is so great about this movie? People meet, there’s a problem, they separate, and then they end up together. What’s the big deal?” Yes, what is the big deal about finding your soulmate and ending up together against all odds? We’re sure love happens all the time, especially to the lady killers who diss rom coms while salivating for voluptuous women in video games. \nThat’s why being detached and cold is cool. The softness associated with “feminine ideas” like love, which are present in such cinema, are uncool by that logic. Thus, rom coms are uncool. It’s a weird equation, and the order of the day is to be philosophically melancholic and detached, which is considered to be more intellectual, or pumped up with more masculine action and adrenaline. \nSource \nLove and romance does not fit in, in a world where hipsters rule, and “hanging out” to “chill” with a potential love interest, is the norm. To be upfront and do lame things like dating or admitting you love someone other than yourself, is good enough to make you seem crazy. This is because love is such a cliché (despite being elusive to most people, including and especially those, who dismiss this very rare feeling as a cliché). What is not a cliché, is movie characters dying in the same type of car chase since 1980. No, a rom-com is what will turn our brain into goo, and ruin society. \nSource \nSo, the question remains, should you waste time on a romantic comedy? Is the practice of laughing and crying through Notting Hill , and feeling your heart turn into warm, gooey, mush, worth the two hours you’d spend on it? Jokes apart, the average rom-com is about happy endings, and tying up loose ends satisfactorily. Watching cinema like that is reassuring and life-affirming in its own way. It’s meant to be a source of faith, to replenish one’s belief in the idea of love. But, to many who have had their hearts broken, cynicism and denying the goodness in anything in the world, is a cool way to hide their sadness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:08:28.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
