I play only first team players. \n“At the moment we have to fight everywhere. If we give up in the championship people will say, 'Are you mad?’ We have to fight for the championship absolutely to strengthen our position in the Premier League. \n“We have a home game against Watford on Tuesday that is absolutely vital again. Workhorse Sanchez may get a break before next week's games with Watford and Chelsea (Photo: PA) \nAfter, we go to Chelsea on the following Saturday so we have absolutely 100 per cent focus — and after that we want to qualify against Bayern Munich in the Champions League [on February 15 and March 7] as well.” \nWelbeck started his comeback after a lengthy knee injury as a substitute in the FA Cup at Preston in the last round, and has also made brief appearances off the bench in the two subsequent league games. \nThe England international will be involved at Southampton, with Wenger admitting some of his forwards need a breather. \nHe added of Welbeck: “He looks sharp, he’s worked very hard. Maybe it will be an opportunity for him. Welbeck's last Arsenal start was ended by injury at Man City in May (Photo: Matt McNulty/JMP/REX/Shutterstock) \n\"In training he still lacks a fraction of zip when he starts. But overall he looks quite fit. What is the most important is that he doesn’t look scared — that’s the biggest hurdle when you come back. \n“The players who played the most in our team offensively are, basically, Sanchez. All the others... Giroud has not played too many games, he is fresh, Walcott is now coming back from a good breather. \n“So up front we have Perez who has not played many games. We have plenty of offensive potential who is fresh. It’s now down to me to use them at the right moment when they are in good form and in the right way.” \nWenger gave Ozil a breather this week and the Germany midfielder was spotted in Sweden rather than at a team meal. Ozil's absence from this squad photo will have worried some Arsenal fans (Photo: Twitter/@Alex_OxChambo) \nAnd the manager said he was puzzled that Ozil missed the dinner as he says he was one of the organisers of the night out. \nWenger added: “I am surprised there is no Mesut Ozil because he is one of them that suggested that. Maybe he was hidden somewhere or didn’t want to be in the photo. \n\"I am sure he was there.” poll loading What's your prediction for this one? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:43:08.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
