Nancy Salem, the teacher in question, also told her followers on Twitter to “kill some Jews.” The Algemeiner reported on the rather disturbing story and also noted that Salem is a supporter of the Boycott, Disinvestment, and Sanctions movement, which is accused of being anti-Semitic: A pre-school teacher in Texas has been suspended from the classroom pending an investigation into her encouraging social media followers to “kill some Jews,” The Algemeiner has learned.\nNancy Salem, who teaches at The Children’s Courtyard in Arlington, as The Algemeiner first reported, was among 24 anti-Israel activists exposed last week by covert campus watchdog group Canary Mission for expressing racist and violent thoughts online. \nSalem — an activist associated with the University of Texas at Arlington chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a supporter of the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement — used her now-disabled Twitter account to post such remarks as: “How many Jews died in the Holocaust? Not enough…HAHAHAHA.” \nThe publication noted that they couldn’t reach Salem for comment as all of her social media accounts have been closed and the school would not release her contact information, as the Children’s Courtyard was still investigating the matter. \nYesterday, local outlet KVTV reported that Salem had been let go. While The Algemeiner reported that she was associated with the University of Texas at Arlington chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, it’s been confirmed that she wasn’t a student there. The local SJP president also said that they never heard of Salem, don’t know who she is, and was never a member of their chapter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:18:07.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
