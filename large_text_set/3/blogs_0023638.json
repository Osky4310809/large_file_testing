US Marines Test New Ship-to-Shore Assault Tech Â© AFP 2017/ TED ALJIBE Get short URL 0 22 0 0 Next month, California will host an unprecedented display of high-tech military ship-to-shore landing drills aimed at boosting the capability of the Marine Corps to storm a beach. \nThe classic World War II images of Marines assaulting heavily-fortified beachheads is set to become a thing of the past, alongside wooden battleships and horse-drawn cannon. The Advanced Naval Technology Exercise at Camp Pendleton in southern California will put on display new technologies aimed at seizing land-based enemy strongholds by attacking from the sea. US Marines' New Chopper to Be More Expensive Than F-35 Disaster \nNext month's series of military-assault drills will feature some 50 realtime technological demonstrations, as well as about the same number of static displays describing other forms of military future-tech. According to Marine Corps think-tank director Doug King, the new form of ship-to-shore invasion he envisions is not \"a bunch of [boats full of soldiers] lined up, putting ashore at six knots.\" \n\"I want to go to a gap in the mangroves that I can penetrate,\" King said, cited by Defensetech.org, \"to where nobody's going to find me, that I can get in and I can, when necessary, concentrate my forces of maneuver against them.\" \nThe new forms of tech to be employed in making King's dream a reality feature a heavy dose of unmanned or autonomous military machines, including quadcopter drones to surveil enemy installations in high-definition 3D, unmanned amphibious assault vehicles and new methods of employing stealth or concealment. \nThe experimental military assault drills will run from April 24-28 and be followed up with additional testing at Camp Lejeune, in North Carolina, in September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:03:35.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
