I don’t say that lightly. \nIt has nothing to do with me and everything to do with my guest, who walks us through gripping stories, tactical details, humor, pain, and emotional redemption. We cover some sensitive and extremely important ground. Thank you, Debbie. \nGraphic Design USA has named Debbie Millman ( @debbiemillman ) “one of the most influential designers working today.” She is also the founder and host of Design Matters , the world’s first and longest-running podcast about design, where she’s interviewed nearly 300 design luminaries and cultural commentators including Massimo Vignelli and Milton Glaser . \nDebbie’s done it all. Her artwork has been exhibited around the world. She’s designed everything from wrapping paper to beach towels, greeting cards to playing cards, notebooks to t-shirts, and Star Wars merchandise to global Burger King rebrands. \nDebbie is the President Emeritus of AIGA (one of only five women to hold the position in the organization’s one-hundred-year history), the editorial and creative director of Print magazine, and the author of six books . In 2009, Debbie co-founded (with Steven Heller ) the world’s first masters program in branding at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, which has received international acclaim. \nWe cover a lot in this discussion: how to recover from rejection, how to overcome personal crises of faith, class exercises from her most impactful mentors, and much more. \nPlease enjoy (and reflect on) this wide-ranging conversation with Debbie Millman… Stream by clicking here.

In fact, some of my good investor friends in Silicon Valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. Why?
