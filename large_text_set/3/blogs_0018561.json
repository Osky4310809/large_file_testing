They should attach warnings \n\"I intend to write a report later to the makers of the phone.\" \nR ichard's mother Carole said: \"I have worried that so many people and especially teenagers, that can't be separated from their phones, don't know how dangerous it is.\" \nHis brother Andrew said: \"When you are younger you are taught about electricity and the bath, but you don't think about this. \n\"I still find it hard to believe that between the charger plug and the phone would be enough electricity to kill someone.\" \nA keen rugby player, Richard captained amateur side Old Actonians RFC as well as playing for Ealing Exiles. \nP C Craig Pattison told the inquest at West London Coroner's Court how he found the extension lead running from the hallway outside into the bathroom. \n\"We found an iPhone plugged into the extension cable and then the charger element in the bath,\" he explained.
