When Lee toured the Bay Area as a guest performer in 2000, she was captivated by the freedom and spirit of experimentation she felt here, and two years later decided to emigrate here. Today her work often incorporates improvised movement, electronic music and video projections, creating an amalgam of old and new. “I’m reaching for an unknown place, while respecting my history,” says Lee.\nFor Ara Ritual II: Time Weaves , staged at Eastside Cultural Center in Oakland earlier this year, Lee partnered with the Bay Area Bhutanese Youth group and the immigrant and refugee artists collective CoRazOn. In a series of workshops Lee organized and led, participants explored through movement, drawing and singing how home connects to the physical body, land and ocean. “My experience working with Dohee has been very empowering and a deep healing process,” says Robin Gurung, a refugee from Bhutan. “It has helped me find my voice.”\n\nLoading Videos… \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:03:34.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
