But there are no differences or only modest differences among Republicans holding high, medium and low science knowledge levels in their expectations of harms to the Earth’s ecosystems because of climate change . \nWhat a sad reflection on our society when science is considered so political that Republicans refuse to accept conclusions reached through mountains of experimentation and evidence. No wonder they fall for Donald Trump ‘s conspiracy theories. No amount of reason will change their minds. They don’t value facts. A democracy doesn’t work when the electorate is ignorant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T12:32:15.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
