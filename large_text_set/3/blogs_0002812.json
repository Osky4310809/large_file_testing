The new Nokia 3310 ( first impressions ) comes in several peppy colours, and is priced at around Rs 3,500. Soon after the launch, Russian phone customisation company Caviar has announced a luxurious model of the modern Nokia 3310. \nCaviar’s Nokia 3310 is inspired by the Russian president Vladimir Putin. Called the Caviar Nokia 3310 Supremo Putin, the phone flaunts a gold-plated portrait of Vladimir Putin on the rear, and a gold seal with a quote from the country’s national anthem. The phone also sports a gold plated button in the front. \nCaviar is taking pre-orders for the limited edition Nokia 3310 Supremo Putin for a premium price tag of 99,000 Russian Rubles, around Rs 1,13,200. The luxury phone comes in a premium wooden box. The Nokia 3310 has a huge fan base, but we think paying Rs 1.13 lakh for a feature phone (albeit a gold-plated one), is a bit over the top.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:53:36.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
