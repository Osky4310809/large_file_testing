Who would believe this? Sweden!\" \nIt was a perplexing comment, mainly because there had been no reports of any recent major incidents in the Scandinavian country, but luckily, the nation's citizens have pitched in to clarify on what the commander-in-chief may have been referring to. \nDelighted to see Trump take an interest in their country, some Swedes have made a video to point out the incidents that occurred, and moved on to educate the US leader. \nTrump, as the president of a country of traditionally Christian values, will be confused himself to learn that the small nation does not praise God, but they take their religious solace from the great Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \n\nSweden just sent out this HILARIOUS response to Donald Trump, who just made up a terror attack there.

He is huge!\" the video says of the former Sweden national team captain and current Manchester United star, as footage of his great overhead kick goal against England plays. \nThe video even goes on to suggest Trump look to IKEA if he wants to get a good deal on building his much-talked about border wall with Mexico, though he will have to build it himself.
