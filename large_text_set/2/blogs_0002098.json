Senators start bipartisan inquiry into Russian election meddling Remember Russia? The country that intelligence officials believe interfered in the 2016 presidential election on Mr. Trump’s behalf? Two weeks into his tenure, talk of the foreign power’s apparent role has somewhat faded from view, at least temporarily, in the daily avalanche of White House exploits and misadventures. But Capitol Hill will have its say. Two senators are convening an investigation into Russia’s election interference, joining other efforts in Congress to examine what happened. \n  Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said their investigation would focus on Russian interference both in the United States’ election and in other elections around the world. (They are the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee that is focused on crime and terrorism.) “Our goal is simple,” the senators said in a joint statement. “To the fullest extent possible we want to shine a light on Russian activities to undermine democracy.” There are already multiple Senate committee examinations into Russia’s role, as well as an inquiry by the House. Trump will keep Obama’s White House doctor Dr. Harold N. Bornstein has been President Trump’s personal doctor for more than 35 years. He prescribed Mr. Trump the prostate-related drug that keeps the presidential mane flowing , and declared him the healthiest man to hold the highest office in the land. But for now, Mr. Trump will keep the same White House doctor who cared for Barack Obama, Ronny Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy. The decision, first reported by the online medical journal Stat , raised the possibility that voters might actually get some reliable information on the health of their commander in chief. C.E.O. meeting at White House could be heating up The meeting of big-shot chief executives at the White House on Friday — people like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone — was supposed to prove the bona fides of the new, business-focused businessman-turned-president. But Mr. Trump’s temporary ban on visas from seven predominantly Muslim countries has complicated the discussion considerably.
