He is young and has many years to grow and improve.\" \nSuarez, meanwhile, feels Isco would be a welcome addition to Barca but urged caution with any deal still a long way from coming to fruition. \n\"Of course I would like to have Isco as a team-mate, all good players are welcome in our team,\" he said to Cadena Ser. \n\"Isco has an incredible talent but right now he is under contract with Real. \n\"We have to wait and see what happens. If he doesn't sign a contract extension, then we can talk.\" \nThe last player to move directly from Real Madrid to Barcelona was Luis Enrique in 1996, while the likes of Luis Figo and Javier Saviola have moved in the opposite direction. \nIsco has only started 13 LaLiga matches this season and has suggested he may have to leave Madrid to get more minutes, despite being happy at the club.
