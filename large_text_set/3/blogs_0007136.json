Michelle Yeoh (\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\") stars as the captain of the Starship Shenzhou. CBS also announced the addition of Mary Wiseman to the crew on Tuesday. She'll play Tilly, a Starfleet Academy cadet assigned to the Discovery.\nDespite delays, \"Star Trek: Discovery\" is now in production and could be released in late summer or early fall .\nIsaacs joins a long line of Star Trek captains with diverse personalities. It will be interesting to see how his role shapes up, especially since it isn't expected to be the show's main focus.\n45 Stellar cosplay warps into Star Trek anniversary convention (pictures)", "external_links": ["https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/UXY9xXbx4fGPIedA_LtkRabi_9U=/724x407/2016/08/04/dec8ac46-869f-4d25-8ea1-d6c191d48385/p1000458-001.jpg", "http://www.metacritic.com/person/michelle-yeoh", "http://www.cbs.com/shows/star-trek-discovery/", "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/sIJE6XtB6jls5wYdSLrNf2XCwFg=/fit-in/970x0/2017/03/07/8764b112-5e04-4e69-b72f-7c4e1300dc8d/jasonisaacs.jpg", "http://www.metacritic.com/person/jason-isaacs"], "published": "2017-03-07T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:11:08.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
