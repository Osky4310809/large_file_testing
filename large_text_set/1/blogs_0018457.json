Now patients can obtain a simple doctor’s prescription will be refunded the upfront cost from their health insurance. \nThe International   promises to provide an update on Germany’s new medical marijuana laws at their San Francisco event on February 17, and has scheduled an April event to be held in Berlin . \nThe law is likely to take effect in March after a procedural reading by the parliament’s upper house.
