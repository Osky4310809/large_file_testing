Abigail Williams & Liberty German: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published Updated 10:47 am EDT, February 22, 2017 38 Comments By Tom Cleary 81.8k Share Tweet Follow Abigail “Abby” Williams, left, and Liberty “Libby” German. (Facebook) \nTwo missing girls were found dead after they vanished while hiking along an abandoned railroad track in a small Indiana town on Monday. \nPolice confirmed Wednesday the identities of the two bodies as Liberty “Libby” German, 14, and Abigail “Abby” Williams, 13, and say they are investigating the case as a double homicide. Police have still not released a cause of death. \n“This is considered a double homicide investigation, and no further information will be released at this time,” Indiana State Police Sergeant Kim Riley said Wednesday at a press conference. \nLater Wednesday, police released photos of a man they are seeking to identify in connection with the case. They have since said they consider him to be the main suspect in the killings. \n“We are asking help from the public to help identify him so he can be contacted regarding what he might have seen,” the Indiana State Police said in a press release. You can see the photos below: (Indiana State Police) (Indiana State Police) \nThe photos were taken from Libby German’s phone, police said. They say she had the presence of mind to record video before her death. Authorities have also released a short audio clip of the suspect saying what they believe to be “down the hill.” You can listen to that clip below: https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/delphi_male_voice_loop-1.mp3 \nOn Tuesday, Riley said police suspected foul play and were investigating the area where the bodies were found as a crime scene, the Indianapolis Star reported. \nRiley said the suspicions arose because of “the way the bodies were found, that’s about all I can say at this time.” \nThe bodies were found on the edge of the water, upstream, against the flow of the creek, police said. \nThe girls, from Delphi, in Carroll County, were reported missing by their family on Monday. Hundreds of people, including police, firefighters, family, friends and residents of the surrounding community, searched for the girls into the night Monday and again Tuesday morning. The bodies were found about 12:15 p.m. Tuesday. \nThe area is known as the Delphi Historic Trails. \n“Right now, we are following up on hundreds of hundreds of leads that have come in,” Riley said Wednesday. “There is nobody of interest at this point in time that we can say.” \nPolice have set up a tip-line for information: 844-459-5786. \nHere’s what you need to know: 1. The Girls Were Dropped Off by Family & Were Reported Missing When They Didn’t Come to be Picked Up \nAbby Williams and Libby German were dropped off by family members at trails near the “Monon High Bridge” just east of their hometown of Delphi about 1 p.m. Monday, WTTV-TV reports. \nThe middle school friends did not have class on Monday because of a snow-day built into the calendar, according to community members. \nThe girls were supposed to be picked up by family later that afternoon, but did not show up, police said. They were reported missing about 5:30 p.m. \nA massive search of the area began, led by local and state police. A drone was used during the search and family members and friends of the girls assisted. A K-9 and dive team were also brought in to help find the girls. \nThe Delphi Fire Department also assisted in the search, and their headquarters was used as a makeshift command center. \n“Having girls of our own, it just hit home,” one of the searchers, Karen Boucher, told the Logansport Pharos-Tribune. “We just wanted to do whatever we could.” \nAnother searcher, Denise Hoverman, told the newspaper, “Nobody was even talking. It was very somber.” \nAn Amber Alert was not issued because police said the case did not meet the criteria, which includes knowledge that a child under the age of 18 is in imminent danger and details about a vehicle or person possibly involved in the incident. The local news was notified and information about the girls was distributed online. \n“Even if we would have put an Amber Alert out, it wouldn’t have done this case any good,” Riley said at a press conference. “The short period of time and the location where the bodies were found, it would not have helped us in finding them.” \nPolice initially said there was no foul play suspected, but that changed a day later. \nOn Tuesday, police announced they found two bodies in Delphi, along Deer Creek, about a half mile from the railroad bridge where the girls had last been seen. \n“It’s been a long several hours,” Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby told reporters Tuesday afternoon. “It’s played tremendously on the emotions of this community.” \nIndiana State Police Sergeant Kim Riley told reporters, “One thing the family asked us to do is to thank the communities around Delphi and the people here in Delphi for assisting in attempting to locate the two young children who were missing here earlier. They just wanted to say thank you to those people and express their gratitude toward the hard work that was done in helping search for the children.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T10:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T06:28:20.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
