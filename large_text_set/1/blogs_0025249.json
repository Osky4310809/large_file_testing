Mr. Trump is expected to formally announce his pick at 8 p.m. ET. \nJudge Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania (left), Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado (right) AP \nIf confirmed by the Senate, the nominee would fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who suddenly died last February . \nPresident Obama had nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the bench, but Senate Republicans refused to consider his nomination because they wanted the outcome of the election to determine the high court’s future. \nOriginally, the president’s announcement was supposed to come later in the week. The pick will be rolled out amid backlash from the executive order the president signed Friday that has blocked all travel to the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries . © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
