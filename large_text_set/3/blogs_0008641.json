(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) \nBOSTON (CBS) — Things appear to be getting ugly between the Patriots and cornerback Malcolm Butler. \nThe restricted free agent is reportedly “extremely frustrated” with the team and wants out of New England, according to CSNNE’s Mike Giardi. Butler wasn’t too pleased to see the Pats sign corner Stephon Gilmore to a five-year, $65 million deal on the first day of NFL free agency while he remains in contract limbo, and according to NFL reporter Jason La Canfora, Butler’s agent is trying to find a team willing to surrender a first-round pick for his services. Source tells me Butler & his camp remain extremely frustrated by Pats position & Gilmore signing. Courting offers elsewhere. Wants new home \n— Michael Giardi (@MikeGiardi) March 13, 2017 Agent for Pats RFA CB Malcolm Butler is contacting teams trying to find one to part w/1st rnd pick to sign him (which is his RFA tender)… \n— Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) March 13, 2017 Pats would be cool with getting a 1st rnd pick for Butler (they don't have a 1 or 2) I hear. Butler is telling teams he wants Gilmore $$ … \n— Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) March 13, 2017 \n\nLa Canfora adds that the Patriots wouldn’t mind losing Butler for a first-round pick, as they currently don’t own a first or second-round selection of their own.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T04:45:18.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
