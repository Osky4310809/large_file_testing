While the dressing is always good, it's not the star by any stretch. This honey mustard dressing, though? It's the reason to make salad in the first place. Don't get me wrong — I love the flavors and textures that make up this chicken tender salad, but it's the honey mustard dressing that makes it worthy of sharing. Sweet and tangy, it coats every inch of this salad with its lively flavor. Take Advantage of the Shortcuts \nWhile the super-speedy homemade honey mustard dressing is the heart of the salad, it's the store-bought chicken tenders that make it a meal. There are so many great options for frozen prepared food in grocery stores these days, and chicken tenders are no exception. You can also order chicken fingers from a favorite takeout spot on your way home to make it even easier. I love combining the chicken with a combination of fresh vegetables and this killer honey mustard dressing to take advantage of the convenience of prepared food, but with a homemade spin. Honey Mustard Chicken Tender Salad Serves 4 \n12 ounces frozen breaded chicken tenders 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 1 head of romaine lettuce, chopped (about 6 cups) 1 avocado, pitted and sliced 1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced 1 pint of cherry tomatoes, sliced 1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced \nFollow the manufacturer's instructions to cook the chicken tenders. \nMeanwhile, in a small bowl stir together the mustard, honey, and apple cider vinegar until smooth. \nAdd the lettuce, avocado, bell pepper, tomatoes, and red onion to a large bowl. Pour the honey mustard dressing over the salad and toss to evenly distribute. Divide the dressed salad among four plates. \nSlice the chicken tenders and top each salad portion with an equal amount. Serve immediately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:07:43.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
