However, the atmosphere above it is a sizzling two million degrees Celsius. \n“You would think the farther away you get from a heat source, you would get colder. Why the atmosphere is hotter than the surface is a big puzzle,” Christian said. \nThe scientists also want to know how solar wind gets its speed, ‘Live Science’ reported. \n“The Sun blows a stream of charged particles in all directions at a million miles an hour. But we do not understand how that gets accelerated,” he said. \nThe mission may also ascertain why the Sun occasionally emits high-energy particles that are a danger to unprotected astronauts and spacecraft. \nNASA has designed a 11.4 centimetres carbon-composite shield, which is designed to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft of 1,370 degrees Celsius. \nThe unmanned probe will have special heat tubes called thermal radiators that will radiate heat that permeates the heat shield to open space, “so it does not go to the instruments, which are sensitive to heat,” Christian added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:05:00.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
