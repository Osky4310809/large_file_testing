The app started crashing and showing users a generic “Facebook has stopped” error message. If you’re seeing this problem, we recommend firing up Google Play and trying to update the app.\nTwo VentureBeat staff members have managed to reproduce the problem on separate Android devices. Facebook for Android users have taken to Twitter to vent their frustration .\nThe good news is that one of our staff members wasn’t seeing the problem and appeared to be on an even newer version (108.0.0.17.68 as opposed to 107.0.0.19.337). To fix the issue, close Facebook completely, update the app on Google Play, and open it again. If this doesn’t work, be patient as Facebook will surely roll out the fix to you soon.\nFacebook updates its mobile apps on a frequent basis, and rarely provides a changelog on what exactly is new or improved. Today is no exception, as the Google Play listing simply states “Improvements for reliability and speed” under the “What’s New” section for today’s update. Not only does that not offer much of a hint, it’s also what was in the section for the last update three days ago.\nWe have contacted Facebook about this issue and will update you if we hear back.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T03:26:28.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
