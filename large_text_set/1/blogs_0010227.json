Angeles (Report) \nThe NFL team plans to follow the Rams to the City of Angels after 55 years Debbie Emery  59 PM San Diego Chargers \nA year ago, Los Angeles didn’t have any NFL teams — now it may have two. \nThe San Diego Chargers will soon announce their plans to move north to the City of Angels, ESPN’s NFL guru Adam Schefter reported Wednesday night. \nThe official announcement could be made as early as Thursday morning, according to Schefter’s sources, with the team playing the 2017 season in Los Angeles. The decision has reportedly already been shared with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the other team owners. \nHowever, ESPN reports that Chargers chairman Dean Spanos has yet to send a formal relocation letter to the NFL, so the deal is not yet final. \n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 12, 2017 \nSpanos had been trying to negotiate with the City of San Diego for a new stadium to replace aging Qualcomm, but the deal appears to have hit a stalemate. \nThe Chargers finished the 2016 season with an average of 57,024 fans per game — an NFL-worst 80 percent attendance , according to SB Nation , but it was the struggle to fund a new home that spurred the move. \nThe Chargers first began life in Los Angeles in 1959 as part of the American Football League, under original owner hotel heir Barron Hilton, son of Hilton Hotels founder Conrad Hilton. Also Read: LA Rams Set to Play NFL 'Home Game' in China in 2018 \nNow they’re set to join the ailing Rams as the second team in Los Angeles. It is expected that they will eventually share the $2.6-billion stadium that Rams owner Stan Kroenke is currently building in Inglewood, which is scheduled to open in 2019. 16 Biggest Sports Tear-Jerkers of 2016, From the Chicago Cubs to Muhammad Ali (Photos) \nChicago Cubs fans cried with happiness – and Cleveland Indian fans from broken hearts – when the team broke a 108-year drought and the curse of a smelly goat to win the World Series Game 7 victory that will go down in baseball history. Amid the celebrations, diehard Cubs fan Bill Murray cried, chugged champagne ... and drunkenly interviewed Cubs general manager Theo Epstein in the locker room. Getty Images \nThe world appeared to stop to honor \"The Greatest\" when Muhammad Ali died on June 3 at age 74. President Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Billy Crystal and Bryant Gumbel were among those who paid tribute to the boxing legend in a star-filled funeral held in his home city of Louisville, Kentucky, as thousands of mourners filled the streets. Getty Images \nNew England Patriots fans sobbed -- and the rest of the NFL cheered -- when Tom Brady threw in the towel in his fight against the Deflategate suspension. The QB sat out four games ... and then went on to lead his team to the clinch the AFC East for the eighth consecutive year. Who's crying now, Roger Goodell? Getty Images \nThe Rams' return to L.A. sparked tears of joy from patience football-starved fans ... until they actually saw them play. Jubilation quickly turned to frustration as first round draft pick Jared Goff spent most of the season sat on the bench and head coach Jeff Fisher was fired after a a devastating 42-14 home loss to the Atlanta Falcons. Oh well, there's always next season -- or the one after that. Getty Images \nThe wasn't a dry eye in the house when legendary announcer Vin Scully called his last L.A. Dodgers game in September. And after 67 years, Scully couldn't hold back the emotion pouring from the press box at Chavez Ravine. “There is no more important broadcaster in the history of baseball than Vin Scully,” filmmaker Ken Burns told TheWrap at the time. Getty Images \nRyan Lochte prompted tears of shame from the IOC and America as a nation when he confessed to making up a story about being robbed at gunpoint with fellow Olympic swimmers during the Rio Summer Games. The gold medal-winner was banned from the sport for 10 months ... and went on to compete on Season 23 of \"Dancing With the Stars.\" Getty Images \nIf tears could be rainbow-colored, then they would epitomize the reaction to \"NBA on TNT\" reporter Craig Sager's death from leukemia on Dec. 15 at age 65. The beloved sportscaster melted even the coldest of hearts (we're looking at you, Coach Popovich) with his lively courtside banter and bright suits. Getty Images \nTalk about going out on top. Some thought Peyton Manning should have hung his helmet up a few neck surgeries ago -- not the Papa John's pitchman himself. No. 18 returned for one more run, and with a great defense, lead the Denver Broncos to the promised land. Cut the water works. \nBill Simmons' fans have had a rocky few years, and 2016 was no exception. This year, the Sports Guy got himself a new website and even a weekly talk show on HBO. Great, right? Well, Simmons barely writes for The Ringer and his \"Any Given Wednesday\" was canceled after just four months . Maybe ESPN is hiring? \nThe knee that shook the world. Colin Kaepernick wasn't even the starting San Francisco 49ers QB when he began one of the most infamous sporting events protests in history. Kaepernick decided early this season he'd no longer stand for the national anthem when played before NFL games. Cut to: a nation (even more) divided. \nThe Internet didn't shed many tears over Skip Bayless jumping ship from ESPN's \"First Take\" for the much smaller Fox Sports 1, though surely someone was sad to see the polarizing personality bid Bristol adieu, right? Executives? The Bayless clan? Anyone? Alright, give us a break, it was a big move and indicative of a troubling trend over at the Worldwide Leaders in Sports. \nLook, Cleveland, you didn't get the World Series Trophy this year, but you did come away with an NBA Championship. That's a pretty good silver (actually, it's gold) lining. When prodigal son LeBron James made good on his guarantee this June, it wasn't just sweat pouring down people's faces. Getty Images \nWhile no hearts were broken except Curt Schilling's when the controversial MLB analyst and former World Series pitcher was booted from ESPN's airwaves in April . One thing is for sure though, there were plenty of tears of rage over his offensive racist and anti-transgender tweets that led to his firing. Getty Images \nKobe Bryant brought Los Angeles to tears by announcing his retirement -- some were of joy, others of sorrow. Bryant is a legend out here, but he also has pretty much set the Lakers back half-a-decade simply by sticking around. Kobe's final game was a tear-jerker for the right reasons, when he poured in 60 points on 50 shot attempts. Getty Images \nThis holiday season, raise a glass of half-iced tea and half-lemonade to a legend. Arnold Palmer was so much more than a delicious summer drink, he was the man who most placed professional golf on the map in the U.S. Palmer was handsome, charming and most of all, talented. He will be missed. \nAfter breaking ground for women's basketball and winning eight championships with her University of Tennessee Lady Vols, coach Pat Summitt lost her battle with early onset dementia Alzheimer’s in June at age 64. Both male and female athletes weeped at the loss of a sporting pioneer. Getty Images Next Slide 1 of 16 \nFrom the deaths of sporting legends to the end of championship droughts, there was plenty for fans to cry about this year \nChicago Cubs fans cried with happiness – and Cleveland Indian fans from broken hearts – when the team broke a 108-year drought and the curse of a smelly goat to win the World Series Game 7 victory that will go down in baseball history.
