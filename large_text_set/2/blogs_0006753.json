These metalenses are instead made from pillars of titanium-oxide (nope? Me neither) which can be created in ultra-thin formations to reflect light to a single focal point.\nThe performance of smartphone cameras is inherently restricted by the size of the devices: you can’t recreate the performance of a DSLR camera with the amount of glass used in a smartphone camera lens. With this tiny new metalens, however, smartphone cameras would stand to produce better results while being lighter, thinner and less complex.\nSee also: Sony’s new camera sensor captures glorious 960 fps slow-mo 2 days ago What’s more, the production of these lenses would reportedly than their glass equivalents and would remove an unwelcome effect known as “ chromatic aberration ” from smaller cameras.\nFor now, the researchers have only managed to successfully apply the technology on a blue-to-green spectrum: it doesn’t yet cover a broad range of colors. It’s nonetheless an exciting development, especially seeing as the team had only achieved it in a single color a few months prior .\nAlas, like the many reports of significant battery life improvements coming to smartphones, who knows when/if we’ll see it in a commercial setting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:27:19.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
