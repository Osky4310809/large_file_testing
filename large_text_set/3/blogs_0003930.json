while Republicans urged hi mto let the House and Senate intelligence committees do their jobs Monday 6 March 2017 10:49 GMT Click to followThe Independent US Despite the severity of his claim Mr Trump has not provided any evidence Mr Obama was responsible for surveillance at his property Reuters \nMembers of the US Congress have responded angrily to President Donald Trump 's request they investigate his unsubstantiated claim Barack Obama ordered Trump Tower to be wiretapped during the election. \nDemocrats sharply criticised the President's call for Congress to investigate his claim, which White House press secretary Sean Spicer said was based on \"very troubling\" reports \"concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election\". \nMr Spicer said the White House wants the congressional committees to \"exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016\". \nRepublicans urged Mr Trump to let the House and Senate intelligence committees do their jobs. Former director of national intelligence denies there was a 'wiretap' at Trump Tower \nKey members of Congress said they would honour the president's request. Read more Former attorney general says Trump Tower was bugged \nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, said the panel \"will follow the evidence where it leads, and we will continue to be guided by the intelligence and facts as we compile our findings.\" \nRepresentative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the committee \"will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party's campaign officials or surrogates.\" \nMr Trump's request carries some risk, particularly if the committees unearth damaging information about him or his associates. \nCommittee Democrats will have access to the information and could wield anything negative against the president. \nAsking Congress to conduct a much broader investigation than originally envisioned also ensures the Russia issue will hang over the White House for months.
