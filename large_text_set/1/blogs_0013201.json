But those contract negotiations are now dead and buried, with Risdon believed to be on the verge of signing a deal with Western Sydney. \n“This has not been an easy decision. I feel the time is right for me to explore a new adventure and grow in a different environment and move out of my comfort zone in Western Australia,” Risdon said. \n“For the past seven years I have bled purple and I owe a lot to Perth Glory and my coaches. \n“It’s here where I have been fortunate to lead the team on the park, and as a result earn a berth in the Socceroos.” Risdon played 127 games for Glory, making him the most capped player in the club’s A-League history.

Amor quashes City rumours 0:51 \n“I am coach here and I am with Adelaide in this moment with a fantastic group.” After claiming the premiership-championship double in 2016, Amor’s side are bottom of the A-League after a miserable start to the Reds’ title defence. The club has lost nine of their opening 14 matches, with a sole win coming against Wellington Phoenix in December. \nAmor said his focus was on returning pride to the Reds. \n“We’ve suffered a lot in every game we don’t win,” he said. \n“For me it’s a challenge for me and the players to win tomorrow and to try and win more games.” \nFinally, Adelaide United have re-signed influential Spanish midfielder Isaias for the next three A-League seasons. \nThe new deal will keep Isaias, 29, at the club until the end of the 2019-20 campaign and comes amid reported interest from Melbourne City. “This is a fantastic feeling because it is a long-term contract and it will be very good for my family as well,” Isaias said.
