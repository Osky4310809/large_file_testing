Well, everyone except for Goodell and the goon squad he employs. bannedfromchoirpractice says: Jan 7, 2017 12:13 PM \nRight, cold makes air pressure drop. That’s never been a problem. The problem comes from sending a guy into a locked bathroom with all the game balls and a ball pump needle to deflate the balls. Also a problem: covering up evidence and thinking you’re being cute during an investigation and legal proceedings. (Three federal judges didn’t find any of it amusing or cute.) concmike says: Jan 7, 2017 12:15 PM \nAs everyone now knows, as the football get colder the air pressure will drop, and the footballs won’t travel as far when kicked or punted. \nHey don’t you even try to introduce science into this story. We all know the NFL gets it science from law firms they hire to make reports that help bolster their side of the story…… \nI hope like hell the Patriots win the Super Bowl this year and Tom Brady uses the vehicle he wins as it’s MVP to run over Goddell on the field before spiking the game ball in his fat ass….. \nThis being said GO PACKERS Beat the Giants…. Jan 7, 2017 12:17 PM \nSounds painful… for your feet of course! lol Jan 7, 2017 12:18 PM \nPre-cooled footballs!? \nSounds like sorcery to me, better suspend him immediately… because you know… integrity… or something… \nOn a side note: That sneaky Tom Brady has been at it again cuz my tire light came on this morning… tootitan says: Jan 7, 2017 12:39 PM \nI hope some of the players and field staff will be interviewed after the game, and asked about frozen balls. By then they’ll all be experts! By that time, those TV dick-shots should be a lot less intimidating too. \nI’m just sayin’, it’s important to keep things in perspective.
