Blass says that the image below is the Verizon version of the phone that will launch in the US. The Moto G5 Plus? Most likely. / © AndroidPIT \nEarlier Lenovo Moto G5 Plus told us a lot in terms of specs thanks to the marketing sticker on the display, but it doesn't give much away in terms of design. For that we have to turn to the previous leaks, which we will show you next. But, first, here's the tweet with the leaked image from Roland Quandt, though the original source is a Google Plus user named Dan Cautella from Brazil. Moto G5 Plus is gonna be 5.2in it seems (at least in Brasil, incl DTV receiver) as on this photo from https://t.co/7gg30LFX4f pic.twitter.com/Eyxf0kCLoz — Roland Quandt (@rquandt) February 8, 2017 \nThe first leaked photos of this device were originally believed to be the Moto X (2017). But, the photos you see below from the old leak are actually the Moto G5 Plus. The Moto G5 Plus, not the new Moto X. / © Techdroider \nThe recent leaked photos from the Romanian seller are of a prototype device, like the kind that gets sent out for testing under a non-disclosure agreement. The photos include a shot where the device is powered on, and we can see the homescreen. The homescreen and back of the Moto G5 Plus. / © OLX.ro \nThere are no signs whether or not Moto Mods will be compatible with the device, but the circular camera area on the back of the device resembles that of the Moto Z Play which did have Mods. This device was not meant for sale. / © OLX.ro \nIn the above photos, where the device's screen is powered off, the \"Motorola confidential property. Not for sale\" disclaimer is clearly visible at the bottom of the device, revealing that this particular device is a prototype or beta version. The sides of the device look comfortable to hold. / © OLX.ro \nHere we see the sides, with ergonomic rounded edges, dedicated volume controls and a power button. This will be the top and bottom of the Moto G5 Plus. / © OLX.ro \nAnd the last set of images shows that there will be a standard headphone jack and Micro USB charging port, rather than USB Type-C . \nWhat do you think of the Moto G5 Play? Would you want it to be compatible with Moto Mods? 87 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:12:07.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
