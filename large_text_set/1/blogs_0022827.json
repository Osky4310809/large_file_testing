Zuckerberg, the CEO of the social media giant, was more reserved in his reaction. \"The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that,\" he wrote in his Facebook post. \"We should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That's who we are. Had we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla's family wouldn't be here today,\" he wrote, referring to Priscilla Chan, his wife. However, Zuckerberg noted some positive reactions to Trump's policies. \"I'm glad the President believes our country should continue to benefit from ‘people of great talent coming into the country,'\" he wrote. \"I was glad to hear President Trump say he's going to \"work something out\" for immigrants who were brought to this country at a young age by their parents.\" According to Zuckerberg, currently about 750,000 young migrants benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program that allows them to live and work legally in the US. The bans, enacted by executive order by Trump January 27, indefinitely suspends the US program to accept Syrian refugees and temporarily bans entry to the US of nationals from predominantly Muslim Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, even if they hold valid visas or green cards, in some cases.
