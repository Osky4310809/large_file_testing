Donald Feud Is The Best Thing Of Trump's Presidency Shares Long Story Short \nDonald Trump asked the public to pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger, as he helped cause The Apprentice to have poor ratings after the now-president left. Arnold quickly responded with a prayer of his own. Long Story \nForget Floyd Mayweather v. Conor McGregor. The blockbuster fight the people want to see is Arnold v. Donald — no holds barred! \nThe feud between the two stars kicked off on Thursday morning at the National Prayer Breakfast, where Trump (I'd say inappropriately, but what else are we to expect at this point), asked the public to pray for Arnold. \"They hired a big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place, and we know how that turned out,\" Trump said to kick off the event, according to ABC News . \"The ratings went right down the tubes. It's been a total disaster. And Mark [Burnett] will never, ever bet against Trump again, and I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings.\" \nvia GIPHY \nWell now the ex-Governator has responded, and lord help the president. \nA spokesperson for Arnold had this message for Trump: “Arnold is praying that President Trump can start improving his own approval ratings, which were the worst in history for an incoming president, by taking his job seriously and working inclusively.” \nBut Schwarzenegger wouldn't stop there. In a video, Arnold said: “Hey Donald, I have a great idea. Why don’t we switch jobs: You take over TV, because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job. Then people can finally sleep comfortably again.” The National Prayer Breakfast? pic.twitter.com/KYUqEZbJIE — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 2, 2017 \nThis isn't the first time since Trump was elected that he tried to trash Arnold (it's not like he has other things to worry about). Trump fired off a series of tweets that blamed Arnold for getting \"'swamped' (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine DJT,\" reported CNN . \nHere's how Arnold responded at the time: I wish you the best of luck and I hope you'll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings. \nFor the love of America, please let this feud continue until it is resolved in a WWE cage. Own The Conversation \nShouldn't Trump be concerned about more important things at the moment? Drop This Fact \nTrump failed to mention that even while he hosted, the ratings plummeted. From the first year Trump hosted to the last, ratings plummetted by 12 million viewers Show comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:26:08.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
