He steals for the gold and the glory, not out of need, and can talk himself out of (almost) any situation. Here comes the smolder…\nID: 10615725 2. Mushu ( Mulan ) View this image ›\nDisney Mushu may not be a ferocious dragon, but he’s definitely cunning. When he destroys the Great Stone Dragon, he sees it as an opportunity to regain his role as a family guardian. His many tricks help Mulan pull off her disguise as a soldier, though not all of his ideas are winners.\nID: 10615730 3. Megara ( Hercules ) View this image ›\nDisney An anti-hero among heroines, Meg is sarcastic, cynical, and not above working with a villain to get what she wants. She agrees to flirt with Hercules in exchange for her freedom from Hades, but redeems herself after falling in love with Herc.\nID: 10615757 4. Judge Frollo ( The Hunchback of Notre Dame ) View this image ›\nDisney Frollo is a master manipulator, capable of biding his time for decades to eventually accomplish his goals. He uses Quasimodo and Phoebus to lay a trap for Esmeralda at the Court of Miracles, and ruthlessly orders his soldiers to execute any innocent people who may have been helping her. Truly, Frollo is an example of a Slytherin gone bad.\nID: 10615763 5. Dodger ( Oliver & Company ) View this image ›\nDisney This dog is one cool character. Dodger knows all the tricks to surviving the streets of New York, and isn’t above stealing sausages and conning kittens to take care of himself and his gang. As a Slytherin, he’s loyal only to those who earn his friendship.\nID: 10615774 6. Tinker Bell ( Peter Pan ) View this image ›\nDisney Tinker Bell is definitely hot-headed like a Gryffindor, but she’s also quite devious; she persuades the Lost Boys to shoot Wendy out of the sky, and when she feels Peter has abandoned her, she helps Captain Hook find his hideout. Plus, she’s sassy AF.\nID: 10615778 7. Maui ( Moana ) View this image ›\nDisney Trickster demigod Maui may frequently shapeshift into an eagle, but he’s no Ravenclaw. Instead, he uses his magical fish hook to achieve glory among humans, eventually leading him to steal the heart of Te Fiti. He’s not too keen on helping Moana at first, and distracts her with a song so he can steal her boat and trap her in a cave. Classic Slytherin.\nID: 10615789 8. Jasmine ( Aladdin ) View this image ›\nDisney Jasmine, like every Disney Princess, is a dreamer, and wants more out of life; what separates her from most of the others (and what makes her a Slytherin) is that she actively pursues her freedom. She is also confident, a self-professed “fast learner,” and understands how to manipulate others, as she shows when she seduces Jafar to save Aladdin.\nID: 10615790 9. Kuzco ( The Emperor’s New Groove ) View this image ›\nDisney Emperor Kuzco has a sense of entitlement that could rival Draco Malfoy’s, and he treats his servants like house-elves. He’s also pretty good with a disguise in a pinch, and pulls off a fake lady voice surprisingly well.\nID: 10615810 10. Ariel ( The Little Mermaid ) View this image ›\nDisney Ariel’s bravery might make her seem like a good candidate for Gryffindor, but when she goes to Ursula for legs, she acts out of selfishness rather than nobility. The final push that prompts her to seek out the Sea Witch is not her curiosity about the human world or her love for Eric, but rather a desire for revenge against her father after he destroys her treasures. Ariel is willing to pay any price to get what she wants, and agrees to abandon her culture, family, and prized singing voice to become human. She knows exactly what she’s getting herself into, as opposed to Merida, who makes a trade with a witch without bothering to ask about the consequences. Ariel is also the only official Disney Princess to seek out and make a deal with her movie’s villain, which is extremely Slytherin.\nID: 10615817 11. Helga Sinclair ( Atlantis: The Lost Empire ) View this image ›\nDisney As shrewd as she is vampy, Helga displays both a keen military mind and the training to back it up when she joins the search for the lost continent of Atlantis. She puts herself before anyone else, and doesn’t hesitate to take down Commander Rourke, her ally, when he double crosses her.\nID: 10615831 12. Mickey Mouse View this image ›\nDisney Yes, Disney’s main mouse himself is a Slytherin! Mickey is a charismatic, scrappy leader who defeats his foes with a combination of craftiness and trickery. His mischievous nature sometimes lands him in hot water, but in true Slytherin fashion, he always comes out on top.\nID: 10615840 Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?
