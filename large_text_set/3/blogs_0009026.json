In 2015 it was named one of the state’s most disadvantaged communities. It has a predominantly Indigenous population and has had widespread issues of violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and unemployment, but a number of community-run programs have worked to improve conditions for the Barkindji people and the reputation of the town. \nJenny Thwaites, chief executive of the Wilcannia Aboriginal Land Council, said she had seen the documentary and was also offended at the way the community was presented. \n“Yes we recognise that the town has a problem with alcohol but there’s a lot of really positive things happening,” she told the Guardian. \n“Small good things are happening. Reggie didn’t come anywhere near the land council,” she said.

I thought: that’s the sort of thing that 20 years ago got the media totally barred from the town. It makes it sound like nothing’s change, but I know it has.” \nThwaites said she was disappointed the BBC let it go to air.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:37:01.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
