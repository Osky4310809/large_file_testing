He asked for backup to “step it up.”\nThe other officers arrived to find Rivera on the ground trying to pin down 300-pound, 5-foot and 6-inch tall Algernon Jemau Baker, 23, of Orlando, according to the report.\nIt took three officers to finally subdue him, police said.\nThe backup officers started investigating and learned Baker was possibly working with a woman, 28-year-old Chris Everette Lema, to shoplift from various stores in the Winter Garden Village mall, according to the report.\nRivera intercepted Baker in the parking lot outside Victoria’s Secret while he was “dropping off items” to their car, the report states. Lema was arrested near the store’s front door.\nPolice said the pair had more than $750 worth of stolen Victoria’s Secret merchandise. Details about what was stolen weren’t released, but a store manager met with police to recover it, the report states.\nEmergency crews took Rivera to a hospital, where he was treated for the broken knee cap and a bite wound on his right thumb, according to the report.\nLt. Scott Allen said Thursday that Rivera is “recovering well and in good spirits.”\nRecords show Baker was being held in the Orange County Jail on $10,400 bail. Lema has since been released.\nsallen@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5417\n Theft Winter Garden", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58adcef1/turbine/os-markeith-loyd-to-judge-i-don-t-wanna-talk-to-you-orlando-news-now-20170222", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ae11e6/turbine/os-bill-filed-again-to-exonerate-groveland-four-20170222", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ae097a/turbine/os-legislation-would-help-first-responders-with-ptsd-20170222", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58aeeb72/turbine/os-winter-garden-police-broken-knee-theft-20170223", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58adbec9/turbine/os-an-orlando-police-officer-berates-a-man-during-a-disturbance-call-20170222", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ace3e9/turbine/os-great-grandmother-fights-off-would-be-carjackers"], "published": "2017-02-23T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:11:12.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
