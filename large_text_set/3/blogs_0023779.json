He issued his ruling last week hours before the travel ban was to go into effect.\n \nThe U.S. Marshals Service is responsible for protecting federal judicial officials, including judges and prosecutors. The service says marshals don't discuss specific security measures but does provide additional protection when warranted.\nWhile Judge Trenga's decision won’t have any immediate effect, it is certain to be cited by administration lawyers as the cases move toward the U.S. Supreme Court .\nMore to follow...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:16:41.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
