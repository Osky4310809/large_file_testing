The ban caused global outrage, as well as chaos across the United States, before it was frozen by a legal ruling. \nTrump is expected to sign a revised travel ban on Monday. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T16:53:59.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
