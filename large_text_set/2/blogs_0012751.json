Conflicting reports have emerged regarding the nature of that altercation, however. The Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety released a statement on the incident, stating charges of robbery, terroristic threats, conspiracy and aggravated assault are pending against Revis, per Mike Garafolo of NFL .com : Mike Garafolo @MikeGarafolo Revis' lawyer told CBS Pittsburgh that the cornerback was assaulted by five people in the incident while in the city to visit with friends and family. Andrew Stockey of WTAE.com also shared the statement from Revis' lawyer: Andrew Stockey @astockeyWTAE #BREAKING Darrelle Revis' attorney issues statement: \"Mr Revis was physically assaulted by a group of at least 5 people\". #WTAE Revis' lawyer said the Jets cornerback sought medical attention following the incident, per Garafolo . He also said \"at no point in time was Darrelle the aggressor\" and noted he was \"retreating\" from the situation. But a conflicting report from WTAE.com paints a far different picture. Per that report, Revis is being investigated by Pittsburgh police for potentially attacking two men. Revis reportedly was approached by the men, who began filming him on a cellphone. Revis then asked the men to leave him alone, and a shoving match ensued. One of Revis' friends reportedly approached, and the two men who had been filming Revis were allegedly attacked. WTAE.com noted, \"A police officer who drove by the area saw Revis speaking to two people; when he came back around, two of them were knocked out and Revis was gone, sources said.\" Both of the men were allegedly taken to the hospital, with one of them suffering broken bones around one of his eyes. The Jets, r esponding to the reports, released the following statement (via Manish Mehta of the New York Daily News ): \"We've spoken to Darrelle. We're aware of the incident. We'll have no further comment.\" Like the new article format? !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:22:21.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
