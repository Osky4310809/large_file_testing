Meanwhile, new rumours have emerged Daniel Sturridge will leave Anfield at the end of the season. \nAccording to Tom Collomosse of the Evening Standard , both Chelsea and Liverpool are desperate to add to their defence and have identified van Dijk as their prime target. \nThe 25-year-old has been among the Premier League's finest this season, leading to plenty of transfer speculation. Per the report, Southampton have denied rumours he has a £25 million buyout clause, and his long-term commitment to the club puts the Saints in a great negotiating position. Alex Livesey/Getty Images \nAs a result, the club could hold out for a fee of roughly £50 million, which would be on par with what Manchester City paid for John Stones. Van Dijk is a more established defender at this stage of his career but still has his best years ahead of him. \nSouthampton don't have to sell but generally do a good job of cashing in on top players when their value is at its peak. The likes of Morgan Schneiderlin, Adam Lallana, Sadio Mane, Victor Wanyama, Jose Fonte and Dejan Lovren have all left the club in the last few seasons, finding varying levels of success elsewhere. \nAnfield has often been a destination, and most of the deals between the two clubs have worked out reasonably well. Mane and Lallana are probably the two best examples, but even Lovren has found his footing after a rough start for the Reds. Stephen Pond/Getty Images \nVan Dijk is a more impressive player than Lovren was at the time, and there's a good chance other top Premier League clubs will get involved in the chase if Southampton do decide to sell. Participating in the UEFA Champions League could prove vital, potentially giving the Reds the edge over the likes of Manchester United . \nElsewhere, former Liverpool defender Phil Babb has told Sky Sports (h/t Daily Express ' David Wright ) he expects the rumours Sturridge will be sold during the summer to come true: \nI think he's coming to the end of his tenure at Liverpool. \nKlopp wants a different type of striker - someone he can rely on from a physical point of view. \nHe's a phenomenal talent around the goal and in the penalty box. But he's been laden with injuries season after season. \nHe hasn't played enough games but his goals to games ratio is fantastic. \nBabb didn't exactly take a leap with his comments, as most fans and pundits fully expect the England international to be sold. The 27-year-old hasn't featured much when healthy this season, and as always, injuries have played a part as well. \nDespite the many setbacks, Sturridge retains a ton of value. As shared by WhoScored.com, he remains an effective forward when he is able to play: Daniel Sturridge: Only 2 players with 50+ apps in the last 4 PL seasons have scored more often than @DanielSturridge (every 129.9 mins) pic.twitter.com/LtSOSfo0VJ — WhoScored.com (@WhoScored) March 1, 2017 \nClubs desperate for his production will pay the Reds a decent fee for his services, knowing full well he's all but assured to miss a significant amount of time. Liverpool will likely add to their attacking depth in the summer whether they sell Sturridge or not, and his fee could aid toward bringing in a top player.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:58:04.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
