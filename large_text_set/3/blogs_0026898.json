Unfortunately, under Trump America, as children wave goodbye, there are 11 million Americans who are unsure whether they are going to come home from work. Donald Trump has declared war on 11 million Americans who are undocumented because of the failure of Trump and his Republican allies to enact comprehensive immigration reform. \nChiu noted that in California, the sixth-largest economy in the world, 45% of farmworkers, 30% of restaurant workers, and 21% of construction workers are undocumented. More than 2.5 million undocumented workers contribute $180 billion to the state’s economy, he said, citing figures from the Public Policy Institute of California . \nWith Trump’s proposal for 10,000 additional ICE employees, lawmakers in California say they are expecting more workplace raids that “rip apart working families” and that are “bad for employers,” the assembly member said. \nWinifred Kao, litigation director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice–Asian Law Caucus, added that, “Unfortunately, we often see employers exploit workers based on their immigration status. AB 450 takes key steps to prevent that abuse and sends an important message that we will not tolerate the exploitation of our immigrant communities.” \nIf passed, AB 450 would provide employers with clear-cut standards to ensure that “disruptive raids” are conducted legally, according to Chiu. \nThe bill would require employers to ask for a judicial warrant before granting ICE access to a worksite. It would prevent employers from sharing confidential employee information without a subpoena. It would also require employers to notify the Labor Commissioner and employee representatives of tax audits. And it would prevent employers from retaliating against employees who report labor violations. \nAB 450 was coauthored by State Senator Scott Wiener and assembly members Phil Ting and Rob Bonta. Assembly policy committees will study the bill in April.
