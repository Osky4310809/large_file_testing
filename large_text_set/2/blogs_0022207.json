The latest iOS update includes dictations features and more.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com As of now, users who upgrade the app should find new experiences including support for Google doodles, new emoji and the ability to type by voice. It also supports 15 additional languages, including “Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Polish, Romanian, Swedish, Catalan, Hungarian, Malay, Russian, Latin American Spanish and Turkish.” You won’t find them there by default, though, so you’ll need to pop into settings to turn each one on individually.\nVoice dictation! Voice typing is probably my favorite feature in the update. Instead of typing out each message, just tap the mic button right on the space bar and speak out your message. Google does the rest for you in the background. The latest emoji from iOS 10 are now included, too, in case you’ve been missing them.\nYou should find the latest Gboard update in the iTunes App Store now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:49:08.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
