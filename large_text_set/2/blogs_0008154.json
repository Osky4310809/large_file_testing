With more than 5,000 developers joining us in person and millions following via live stream, Build and Seattle will be the hub for what’s next. \nBuild’s also the place to get deep technical dives into the great things we’re doing today to help developers build the next generation of intelligent apps and services. We’ve been “building” toward this for a while — for instance, Tuesday, we announced updates to our Cognitive Services that help developers build apps that understand people and the world around us. Wednesday, we announced the current preview SDK for the Windows Creators Update is feature complete. We also announced Azure Managed Disks and VM scale sets , which bring ease of use and scale benefits of PaaS to our IaaS developers. \nIn the coming weeks, we’ll share more on the opportunity for developers to deliver experiences to people as they collaborate in Microsoft Teams. And on March 7, we’ll celebrate a new generation of Visual Studio 2017 designed to help developers build on any platform, for any platform, using nearly any language. \nMicrosoft Build 2017, May 10-12 in Seattle, will be the place for developers to learn how to put these latest innovations — and what’s next — to work building: Mixed-reality experiences Cutting edge, intelligent cloud apps Simplified end-to-end dev ops experiences Mobile experiences for nearly any device Apps that make your customers more productive AI-powered apps we have yet to imagine \nJoin us in person — or online — for keynotes, deep technical sessions, hackathons and opportunities to collaborate and code with your fellow technologists and Microsoft engineers. Tickets go on sale Feb. 14 at 9:00 a.m. PST at http://build.microsoft.com . \nThere’s never been a more exciting time to be a developer, or a more exciting time to build with Microsoft’s products, tools and cloud services. \nWe hope to see, connect and code with you — at Build 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:34:37.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
