I can’t wait, I’m so happy for them.” \nOthers, however, have said all along that Cheryl and One Direction's Liam should be left alone to enjoy their newborn baby in private without feeling the need to announce the news to anyone other than their family and friends. \nOne wrote: “Cheryl and Liam will say about the baby when they’re ready to and if they don’t it is up to them. It’s their private life.” \nAnother said: “They want privacy, respect that… I’d hate to be famous.” \nCheryl, 33, and 23-year-old Liam have been notoriously tight lipped about their relationship ever since they got together. They’ve rarely appeared in public together or posted joint images to Instagram and have never once spoken about one another in any interview. \nThey only confirmed the pregnancy news in February, when Cheryl posed for a photoshoot for Prince’s Trust and L’Oreal showing off her blossoming baby bump. \nApart from that photo, there's been no other word from the happy couple about their tot, so fans have been left to guess whether it will be a boy or girl and what name might be chosen. \nReferencing One Direction's Louis Tomlinson's baby son Freddie, one fan said: \"I'm hoping for a girl since 1D already has a baby boy. Gotta be diverse.\" \nBut another reckoned a boy would be a good thing: \"Liam and cheryl will soon become parents. what if theres another baby boy. omg another generation of one direction (sic).\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:17:39.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
