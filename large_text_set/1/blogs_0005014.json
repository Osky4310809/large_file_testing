One Indonesian woman seemingly couldn’t, making her the subject of much mockery online. \nTribun News today reported that a viral Facebook post went up on December 26 which includes a photo of two objects and a caption that says “Thank God, I got a power bank and a microphone as a gift.” The post has already been shared over 1,500 times. \nWe can assure you that the photo above, which was censored by Tribun News, does not in fact show a power bank and a microphone. The larger item is almost certainly Fairy Wand Massager Multi-Speed Personal Massage Vibrator. \nThousands of comments inevitably poured in, with many netizens teasing what they believe to be the woman’s naivety with comments like, “the mic is so cute and pink,” and “Why don’t you use the powerbank?” \nTribun News kept the woman’s identity a secret to protect her online privacy. That said, we were easily able to find Facebook profile, which appears to be legitimate, and the controversial post is indeed still there on her personal wall. \nThe question is, is OP hopelessly naïve or did she in fact know exactly what it was she was posting and this was also just a clever ploy to achieve internet fame? Well, considering that so many netizens have pointed out to her what the “mic” and “power bank” really are, and yet she still hasn’t removed the post, we’re leaning towards the latter. \nAt either rate, let’s just assume it’s all in good fun and hope no overzealous conservative reports her to the authorities for spreading pornography and violating the Information and Electronic Transactions Act (UU ITE).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T06:42:57.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
