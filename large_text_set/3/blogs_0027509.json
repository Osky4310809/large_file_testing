If it has begun early, it could lead to a cold snap on Earth. NASA The comparison in solar activity \nThe last time that there was a prolonged solar minimum, it led to a ‘mini ice-age’, scientifically known as the Maunder minimum. \nThe Maunder minimum began in 1645 and lasted through to 1715, where sunspots were exceedingly rare. GETTY Temperatures across the globe could drop \nDuring this period, temperatures dropped globally by 1.3 degrees celsius. \nAlthough it seems insignificant, it led to shorter seasons and ultimately food shortages.
