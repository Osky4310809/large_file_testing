It’s started with a barrage of body shots by Smith, who punched his way to a maiden Test century in India which finished on 109, with a lead of 401 in the bank. media_camera Steve Smith celebrates his century. \nThe expression on the Australian skipper’s face as he reached the mark said it all. \nHe was emotional, to say the least. \nHe’s taken a squad to India which has been more than written off, it’s been belittled and humiliated prior to a ball being bowled. \nHis knock wasn’t chanceless — he was dropped three times on day two and was fortunate to survive a strong LBW shout before lunch on day three — but it has put Australia in a position to secure a drought-breaking victory, which would be their first since 2004. \nSmith produced a grafting effort on day one, battling through a difficult period for Australia after coming in following the dismissal of David Warner and the untimely illness felt by Matthew Renshaw. \nHe fought his way to 27, before falling to Ravi Ashwin from 95 balls. \nIt was a soft dismissal, chipping to mid-wicket — and the man who caught him? Virat Kohli. \nAdvantage Kohli. \nBut if Smith’s dismissal was a body blow to his reputation as the world’s best batsman, Kohli’s two-ball duck on day two was a knockout delivered by Mitchell Starc. \nThe Indian captain sent a shudder through Pune when he chased a wide ball from Starc and managed only to slice it to Peter Handscomb standing at first slip. \nAustralia was cock-a-hoop and their cheers could be heard loud and clear because the rest of the stadium was deathly silent at seeing the Kohli stopped in his tracks. \nFormer Australian captain Michael Clarke said the impact would’ve been felt most behind closed doors. \n“The change room won’t be able to believe Virat Kohli is out for zero,” Clarke said in commentary. \n“Talk about things being different. \n“The Indian captain back in the rooms for zero is not something the Indian team or fans are used to seeing.” \nSeeing Smith notch centuries is a far more common sight. \nSaturday’s was his 18th in Test cricket and tenth since becoming captain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:42:17.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
