He was trolled by the National Parks Service over crowd sizes , which led to an all-time outburst by Press Secretary Sean Spicer . Then Duff Goldman — baker to the stars and our chief advisor on where to eat in Baltimore — expressed confusion at seeing that Donald Trump’s cake had been an exact copy of the cake that he made for Barack Obama’s 2013 post-inauguration soiree. \nThe cake on the left is the one I made for President Obama's inauguration 4 years ago. The one on the right is Trum… twitter.com/i/web/status/8… — \nDuff Goldman (@Duff_Goldman) January 21, 2017 \nObviously, Trump’s favorite form of social media was abuzz about the cake-spiracy.\nTrump Cake is the hero we deserve, but not the one we need right now. #trumpcake #imbatman pic.twitter.com/OTnIyMaX6s \n— Robert Moore (@MooreOn___) January 22, 2017 \nI think the best part of the #Trumpcake business is that the original was 7 different flavoured cakes, and the copy was mostly styrofoam.\n— Kylie Chan (@kyliecchan) January 22, 2017 \n\n\nIn a fascinating twist, Buttercream Bakeshop in DC , posted a photo on Instagram of the cake they made for Trump’s inauguration ball. Just like Duff claimed, the cake is pretty much the spitting image of the cake he made for Obama . But, the bakery didn’t try to hide that. Instead, they gave credit to Duff. Even posting, “While we most love creating original designs, when we are asked to replicate someone else’s work we are thrilled when it is a masterpiece like this one.” \nThey always say that imitations is the sincerest form of flattery, right?\n\nThis is when some subtle trolling came into play. Instead of pocketing what was likely a hefty sum of cash, the bakery decided to donate the profits from the homage-cake to Human Rights Campaign — the largest LGBTQ rights organization in the US. The LGBTQ community is notably fearful about what will become of their basic civil rights during the Trump administration (particularly due to the avowed beliefs of VP Mike Pence ). The Instagram post continued, “Because basic human rights are something every man, woman and child~ straight, gay or the rainbow in between~ deserve!”\n\n\nAs of press time, America is still touted as the most free country in the world. A place where nobody can be judged based on the color of their skin, their religion, or their sexual orientation. The hope of Buttercream Bakeshop and many others is that it remains that way.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T19:10:59.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
