If it makes him feel any better, the Giants don’t seem to either. \nVia Bob Glauber of Newsday , Giants owner John Mara said their goal was still to get a long-term contract with their pass-rusher. \n“I heard him say that, yes, and we’re trying to get a deal done ,” Mara said. “We want to get him signed long-term, but we had to do that [tag him] to protect ourselves. Hopefully, we’ll be able to reach an agreement, but I can’t say it’s imminent. . . . \n“He’s an important part of our team. He played at a high level last year. He gave us a huge boost. Having him on one side and [Olivier] Vernon on the other gives us a nice pair of bookend pass rushers, so yeah, we’d like to have him back. Plus, he’s a positive influence. He’s a good young man, very popular [in the locker room]. He’s the type of guy you want on your team.” \nBut as long as he’s sitting there with a $16.934 million cap hit, it’s going to limit their ability to make other moves this offseason. Last year’s free agency period was a blur for the Giants, spending early and often as General Manager Jerry Reese tried to rebuild their defense by signing Vernon, cornerback Janoris Jenkins and defensive tackle Damon Harrison . \n“We’re obviously not going to be as aggressive as we were,” Mara said. “We just don’t have the salary-cap room, and you can’t do that every year. Putting the franchise tag on Jason takes a lot of our room away, but there’s still enough room for us to do some things if we want.” \nThat could make them a little more likely to bend when it comes to Pierre-Paul’s contract desires, since the tag leaves something to be desired for both sides.
