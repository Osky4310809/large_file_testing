The most prominent of them is the \"between-my-legs takedown,\" in which the action heroine tackles her opponent by straddling him or her, making for a great opportunity for a crotch shot. \nIt would be one thing if this was an extremely sophisticated maneuver that helped the action heroine save the day, but as Fandor notes in the video below, it doesn't seem to serve any purpose whatsoeverâ€”except to sexualize the hero.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T04:38:10.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
