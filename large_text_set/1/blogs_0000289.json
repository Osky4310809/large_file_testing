Is the Colin Kaepernick era coming to an end Sunday?

But behind the scenes, Kaepernick and his agents worked to renegotiate his contract in October allowing both sides a chance to move on this spring. \n“It was something that we thought was mutually beneficial while doing the contract,” Kaepernick said Nov. 1. “That’s a long ways out.” \nWith the season finale upcoming, the ultimate tipping point in the relationship between player and organization is now in plain view.

In turn, Kaepernick gave his injury guarantee, which forced the 49ers to bring him back in 2016 even after he requested a trade in February. \nKaepernick was asked about his future Tuesday and maintained his week-to-week mantra, negating talk of 2017 as a distraction. \n“My focus once again is this week and making sure that I’m doing everything I can to prepare and to try to help my teammates prepare this week to get a win and I think that’s where this whole team’s focus is,” Kaepernick said. \nThis year has been an eventful one for Kaepernick. \nHe had surgery to repair knee and thumb injuries in January. He requested a trade in February. He met with the Broncos to talk about a new contract to help facilitate a trade to Denver in the spring.

Then came the re-done contract and his return to the starting lineup in October. \nBut, despite all that, Kaepernick maintains it hasn’t been difficult to keep his focus on football in seven-day stanzas during the season. \n“When I step into this building my focus is football and what I have to do to try to win and try to help this team win and I think our players, our coaches all have that same mentality,” Kaepernick said. “So, to me it’s an easy environment to come into and work and make sure you’re staying focused on that.” \nKaepernick will likely speak to reporters twice more – after Sunday’s game and exit interviews Monday – before leaving the team’s facility for the offseason, where he might never return as a member of the 49ers.
