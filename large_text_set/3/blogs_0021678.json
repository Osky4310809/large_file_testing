With only 52 Republicans, at least eight Democrats will have to support him in that effort. There are a handful of Democrats, mostly who face tough reelections next year, who could support him, including Sens. Joe Manchin of W.V. and Heidi Heitkamp of N.D. Whether there are enough to get to 60 votes remains unclear. \nRepublicans can change the Senate rules, however, to require only a simple majority, a tactic known as going \"nuclear,\" which is something that Trump has encouraged. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell won't publicly entertain the idea — yet. \nFormer Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid used this maneuver for cabinet nominations when President Obama was in office, something that Schumer has said he regrets now that he leads the minority. \nWhether now-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will follow suit remains the biggest question for the Gorsuch vote because doing so would change Senate rules going forward for Supreme Court nominees, impacting the minority party's ability to influence the process in the years ahead. Open Wounds From Garland Nomination \nDemocrats are have another issue of concern that, again, doesn't have anything to do directly with Gorsuch — Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee for the same seat who never received a hearing from the GOP-controlled senate. \nWhen Justice Antonin Scalia died more than a year ago, leaving the court with only eight justices, then-President Obama nominated Garland, a center-left judge, to fill the opening. \nBut McConnell's GOP blocked the Senate from taking up the nomination, a move that while successful in preventing Garland from being elevated to the high court, left Democrats bitter. \n\"As you know, I played arguably the single biggest role in having the vacancy there,\" McConnell said at Politico Playbook breakfast earlier this month. \nAnd McConnell said the move helped Trump win the election. \"And politically, oddly enough, not only did it not hurt our guys who were running, it actually helped the president bring Republicans home, and he ended up getting 90 percent of the Republican vote, just like Mitt Romney did, and the single biggest issue was, 'who do I want to make this Supreme Court appointment.'\" \nDemocrats are entering Gorsuch's confirmation hearing with that episode still fresh in their minds — not only was Obama blocked from getting his nominee, but at least McConnell, one of the best political strategists in Washington, thinks Trump won because of it.
