But while that may still happen, the actual announcement is arguably much more exciting, at least for the West. Square Enix and Marvel have struck a multi-game partnership starting with an Avengers game.\nCheck out the trailer!\nThere aren’t too many details but the ones we know are pretty promising. The Avengers Project is being developed by Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal, the folks behind the excellent Tomb Raider and Deus Ex reboots, respectively. Based on the hammer, broken glasses, robot arm, and patriotic shield, we can assume Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, and Captain America will star in this “original story” with “iconic moments” that will thrill “longtime fans of the franchise.” Based on the tone, visuals, and voiceover, they seem pretty beat-up and demoralized. These heroes need to #reassemble. But we don’t know when that will happen since the trailer doesn’t give any release window outside of “2018.”\nThe announcement does specify that this is a multi-game announcement, which is good news since Marvel’s video game efforts mostly floundered during the building of the MCU. The Phase 1 games from Sega were so mediocre that no other serious, non-casual MCU games have been developed since. THQ was working on a first-person Avengers game featuring Skrulls, but it was cancelled.\nHowever, Marvel has said it wants to recommit to AAA video games with the right partners and we can see the proof of that initiative. We’re getting a new Marvel vs. Capcom , a slick-looking Spider-Man game from Insomniac exclusively for PlayStation 4, a Guardians of the Galaxy Telltale game , and now this Square Enix Avengers game to look forward to.\nWhat other games could come from this partnership? A gritty, M-rated Defenders game? A surreal M.O.D.O.K. adventure a la Katamari Damacy . With Marvel and Square Enix now officially in business. I still think it’s only a matter of time before we’re forced to witness Hawkeye hanging out with some Final Fantasy dope. #Reassemble.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/rq_V6WHSmQs?feature=oembed?wmode=transparent", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bd4OeguMpI"], "published": "2017-01-26T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T08:10:21.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
