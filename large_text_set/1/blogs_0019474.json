Scott Allen won the title at age 16 back in 1966. \nCoral Springs' Andrew Torgashev, who at 15 was the youngest skater in this year's Senior Men's competition, started in seventh place after the short program and finished 11th overall. His score of 225.35 was just eight points out of sixth place. \n\"I was just happy to get the programs out there,\" said Torgashev, the 2015 U.S. Junior Men's Champion who was making his debut in the Senior Men's championship. \"They weren't perfect, but that means there is room to grow.\" \nBased on his performance at the event, Torgashev was selected to compete at the 2017 Junior World Championships from March 15-19 in Chinese Taipei. \nHis personal best entering the free skate was 139.44, but he skated to Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and finished with a 147.53 for 225.35 total. He is a member of the Panthers Figure Skating Club in Coral Springs and sophomore at North Broward Prep. \nTorgashev had fallen in his short program doing a quad toe loop, however that was not the case on Sunday. It was the first time he landed a quad in a competition. \n\"The atmosphere was way different than any other nationals that I have ever done,\" he said. \"There was TV crews everywhere and skaters that I have been looking up to for a long time. It was great to skate along side of them and compete against them. I was so happy to land my quad.\" \nAnother Panthers Figure Skating Club member, Franchesca Chiera, 19, also of Coral Springs, was in 13th after the short program in the Senior Ladies and scored 104.44 late Saturday for a 158.41 total, which was good enough for 15th place. It was her fourth appearance at nationals. \n\"I definitely had a moment in the free skate,\" Chiera said. \"I could have had a better short (program), but I felt happy with how I skated. I think I showed I am capable and belonged there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:26:32.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
