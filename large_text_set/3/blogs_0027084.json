Calhoun, the secretary of war under James Monroe, secretary of state under John Tyler, and Vice President. The students said that Calhoun, a racist slaveholder, should have no place on the campus. The Yale President agreed, and — after resisting the change — finally caved to the students. \nBut guess what? You can’t ever satisfy the perpetually aggrieved leftist students. Who knew? M.J. Randolph reports : \nNow, the students have targeted another building, their $150 million student center. According to Yale Daily News , Stephen Schwarzman – the Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of Blackstone – gave the university “a world-class, state-of-the-art campus center by renovating the historic Commons and Memorial Hall.” In fact, his gift was the second-largest single donation in Yale’s history. Instead of being grateful for the center, which is “a university-wide center that serves as a campus educational, social, and cultural hub, and enables virtual engagement with global audiences,” the students are throwing another tantrum. Schwarzman, you see, has ties to President Donald Trump because he has a position on Trump’s economic advisory council. The students believes this makes him guilty for the President’s “damage to our economy, society and republic.” \nIt will be interesting to see if Yale President once again caves to the insatiable student demands, or if he’ll have the guts to stand up — finally — to the insanity. Glenn Reynolds has a perfect solution : “The solution is simple: stop giving money to Yale.” \nI’d echo that sentiment. I have no idea why any conservative parent would spend one dime sending their kid to Yale. Do you see liberal parents lining up to send their kids to famously conservative Hillsdale College so their kids can have their world views challenged? \nHardly. \nI hope the students never stop, until Yale is just one big Women’s March.
