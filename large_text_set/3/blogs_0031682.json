All About Dolly Parton in Honor of Tonight’s ACM Awards 2016 Published Updated 7:56 pm EDT, April 4, 2016 4 Comments By Lauren Weigle 20.9k Share Tweet Follow Dolly Parton Dolly Parton, age 70, is being honored tonight at the 2016 Academy of Country Music Awards (ACMs) and she is taking the stage with pop artist Katy Perry for the event. So, what's the story with one of the biggest country stars in our nation's history? Well, other than her being Miley Cyrus' godmother (no we aren't kidding), she's accomplished quite a lot in her lifetime. As for her personal life, she has been married to the same man, Carl Dean, for almost 50 years and the two never had children. When it comes to Parton's outlook on not having kids, she told People that: I grew up in a big old family with eight kids younger than me and several of my brothers and sisters came to live with me early on in my life. I've loved their kids just like they're my grandkids, and now I've got great-grandkids! I often think, it just wasn't meant for me to have kids so everybody's kids can be mine. In Parton's 70 years on this planet (born January 19, 1946), family aside, she has become a true legend in her field. But, before we get into that, let's talk about two of the things that Parton was known for in her prime - her breasts. Those torpedoes were the talk of the town, sitting on that petite frame of hers. Since Parton first started out in the entertainment industry, she has gotten several plastic surgeries. CelebrityABC believes Parton to have had several breast surgeries, brow lifts, cheek implants, eyelid lifts, a nose job, laser skincare, blepharoplasty, botox and a face lift. Phew. That's a lot of time under the knife. But, with a net worth of $500 million, she can definitely afford it. For more information on Parton, click through our gallery of her best photos over the years.
