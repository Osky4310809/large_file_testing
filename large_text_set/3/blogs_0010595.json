Butler wasn’t too pleased to see the Pats sign corner Stephon Gilmore to a five-year, $65 million deal on the first day of NFL free agency while he remains in contract limbo, and according to NFL reporter Jason La Canfora, Butler’s agent is trying to find a team willing to surrender a first-round pick for his services.\nSource tells me Butler & his camp remain extremely frustrated by Pats position & Gilmore signing.
