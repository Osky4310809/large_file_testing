She clearly loves it and I’m not fast enough feeding the little pieces of soft sweet pear into her mouth. Asha is a Black Flying-Fox in care with a specialist wildlife bat carer. It’s quite late in the season for such a young baby to come into care. She is being hand raised for release. When she’s 3 months old she will go to a creche where there will be other late babies from the season. She will shrug off her human conditioning and learn to be a bat. \n\nRelated Laughing Squid Posts Australian Bat Rescue Clinic Demonstrates How to Swaddle Baby Bats So That They Look Like Burritos Swaddled Flying Fox Gleefully Devours a Couple of Grapes at a Bat Rescue in Sydney, Australia Flying Squirrel Thrives Under the Care of Her Dedicated Human Who Rescued Her From Near Death ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:29:44.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
