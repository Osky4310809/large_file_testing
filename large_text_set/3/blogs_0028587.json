Is it the sight, sound, or smell of a cat that excites dogs the most? Posted Mar 28, 2017 MORE Source: Image licensed from clipart.com \n\"They fight like dogs and cats!\" is a typical statement which expresses the universal belief that there is something about cats which brings out negative and aggressive behavior in dogs. The problem is that nobody knows what that \"something\" is. \nOf course there is one situation where we do know what the trigger is. That usually occurs when a dog encounters a cat outdoors. For many cats the sight of a dog will cause them to run, and once the dog sees a fleeing cat the canine prey drive cuts in and dog begins an excited pursuit. However this is not cat specific behavior. It is simply the sight of something furry running. A squirrel, a rabbit, or a rat running across the dog's field of view will produce the same chasing behavior. It is the dog's natural instinct to run after fast moving things. This can sometimes include kids on skateboards or skates, or even cars, neither of which has the vaguest resemblance to cats. \nI remember one evening I was observing an advanced beginners dog obedience class. The instructor, a lighthearted woman named Shirley, had brought her cat to class, something that she always did at about this point in the course. The cat was a big Siamese who lived in a house full of Poodles and was very calm around dogs. The cat's purpose in class was to serve as a distraction—to help in proofing the dog's abilities to heel beside and pay attention to their owner even when there was something interesting and exciting nearby. Although the dog owners were concerned about how their dogs might react to the cat, things actually unrolled in a quiet manner. The cat, in its carrying kennel, was placed near the edge of the mat where the dogs were to walk past it. The cat was attentive, but quietly watched the passing parade. Initially the dogs were interested, at least to some degree, and would stop and glance into the kennel and give a sniff. By the second or third time walking past the cat the dogs were giving it very little attention. \nAt that point Shirley picked up the carry kennel and placed it back on the table. Apparently she had done so a little bit too quickly for the cat's comfort and she gave a bit of an startled \"meow\" sound. The dogs in the class who had been rather indifferent to the feline visitor up to this point suddenly looked intently in the direction of the cat and two of them excitedly barked. I remember being puzzled when observing this, asking myself what had changed to cause the dogs to react at that point and suddenly direct their attention to the cat. It has been several years since that incident but I now have the answer. \nA new study by a team of investigators headed by Christy Hoffman of the Department of Animal Behavior , Ecology, and Conservation at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York looked at what it is about cats that catches the interest of dogs most strongly. Is it the sight of the cat, the sounds it makes, or the smells that surround it which trigger the interest of dogs most strongly? Their findings are published in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science. \nThe study was fairly straightforward. It involved looking at the responses of 69 pet dogs of a variety of breeds, including mixed breeds. They videotaped the responses that the dogs produced when they viewed a realistic looking animatronic cat doll (which could wag its tail, move its head, and also move its paws allowing it to slowly propel itself across the floor). As a non-cat like visual control stimulus they used a pillow case with a motorized ball inside. The pillow case moved and vibrated when the ball inside it was activated. The experimenters could alter these displays to smell like a cat by wiping it with a few drops of cat urine. \nTo provide sound stimuli the investigators took samples of normal cat sounds and played them from speakers located behind a screen which was seen through an open door that the dogs could not pass through. \nGiven this set up I would have predicted (as did the experimenters) that the dogs would pay the most attention to the cat-like doll, especially if it were daubed with a cat urine to make it smell like a feline. Although the dogs did look at the cat doll, it turns out that adding the cat smell to it did not increase their interest. It was almost as though the dogs recognized that this looked like a cat and therefore making it smell like a cat did not do anything but verify their identification. (It is interesting to note that adding the cat smell to the pillowcase did increase their interest a bit, probably causing them to wonder where the cat might be in this thing which did not look the least bit cat-like.) \nWhat the dogs did pay attention to most was the cat sounds coming from some place out of sight. Hoffman noted \"As humans, our first thought was to test dogs' responses to the cat doll because it visually resembles a real cat. However, our findings suggest that dogs are relying more heavily on another sense, hearing. This was surprising since most behavioral assessments focus on dogs' responses to visual stimuli.\" \nWhat is most interesting, perhaps, is the fact that it was the dogs who had a history of aggressive encounters with cats who paid the greatest interest to the cat sounds. This difference was large enough so that Hoffman suggested that \"it may be possible to use audio recordings of cats to assess which shelter dogs are likely to fare well in a home with cats or other small animals.\" \nThere is also a take-home message from this study which should see be of interest to cats (including Shirley's) and that is if they want to avoid unwanted attention from dogs they should move slowly and stay quiet. \nCopyright SC Psychological Enterprises Ltd.
