Rev. Peter Okpalaeke as Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ahiara, Mbaise, took a dangerous dimension weekend, when angry youths sacked the Parish Priest of St. Peter’s Catholic Parish, Amano Obioha, Monsignor Cletus Ogu. \nVanguard gathered that the priest, a pro-Okpalaeke loyalist, is said to be preparing to celebrate his golden jubilee anniversary as a Catholic cleric. \nOne of the stories that made the rounds was that Monsignor Ogu was celebrating the scheduled Sunday Mass in the church, when some youths locked up the rectory. \nAn indigene of the area that spoke to Vanguard yesterday on the issue, confirmed that “the ageing priest was busy with his sacerdotal assignment in the church, not knowing that some youths had locked the entrance into the parish house.” \nHowever, another version of the story had it that “hell was let loose when Monsignor Ogu attempted to gain entrance into the church for Sunday Mass, but was barred by angry youths”. \nOn what led to the near ugly incident, some respondents accused Monsignor Ogu of being responsible for the transfer of his curate, who they claimed, “is loved by parishioners”. \nA priest, Rev. Dr. Jude Uwalaka, confirmed the incident in a telephone chat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:52:54.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
