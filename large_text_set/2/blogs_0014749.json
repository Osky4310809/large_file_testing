Would developers target one system over the other? Would the older hardware get left behind? Horizon Zero Dawn is a highly important title - developer Guerrilla Games has a reputation for remarkable technical innovation and accomplishment. The team would be expected to deliver a title that showcases the power of PS4 Pro, while at the same time demonstrating that there's plenty of life in base hardware. Based on a week with the game, the developer has delivered on both counts. Horizon is a stunning technical showcase, no matter which iteration of PlayStation hardware you own.\nIf we look back at the reveal of PS4 Pro at last September's PlayStation Meeting, we were promised a system that delivers enhanced graphics, higher performance and a 4K presentation. Back then, the demo we saw certainly delivered on the latter, at least. Horizon's implementation of checkerboard 4K was simply stunning - perhaps a touch softer than native rendering, but beautiful nonetheless. Alongside Sony Bend's Days Gone, it was the showcase for the Pro's 4K capabilities. However, the demo was clearly early - as borne out by a work-in-progress performance analysis , which showed frequent frame-rate drops beneath the target 30fps.\nThe final game sees the vast majority of these issues resolved, with the vast majority of gameplay operating at a locked, properly frame-paced 30fps. It's the scalability of the Decima engine between PS4 and PS4 Pro that proves fascinating though - both versions still exhibit very minor instances of dropped frames (barely noticeable for the most part and masked by motion blur when they do appear) and these very minor drops are essentially mirrored between both platforms, with a very small improvement on PS4 Pro. It seems that extensive particle work and alpha effects cause the drops - as infrequent as they are.\nJohn Linneman presents initial analysis of Horizon Zero Dawn's performance and features on PlayStation 4 and PS4 Pro.\nAlso important is the consistency of performance during traversal in the open world. Producing a sandbox game of this scale is not an insignificant task - many similar titles struggle to maintain solid performance during traversal as the CPU needs to stream in and decompress open world data on the fly, while continuing to process game logic and prepare instructions for the GPU. It's for this reason that titles like Fallout 4 and Just Cause 3 can hitch and stutter when the player does nothing more than move from A to B through the environment. Crucially, Horizon Zero Dawn is immune to this issue - making your way through the open world is a super-smooth experience regardless of the PlayStation hardware you're using.\nHorizon's excellent performance at checkerboard 4K vs the native 1080p of the base PS4 version is a great achievement. While the Pro hardware has 2.3x the GPU power of the standard model, memory bandwidth hasn't scaled in step - and it's rare that we see a PS4 engine scale so gracefully between 1080p on base hardware and 4K on Pro (checkerboard or otherwise). That Guerrilla has achieved this with no impact to performance is impressive enough, but the team has pushed the envelope here, handing in more visual enhancements over the base version of the game.\nWhile Horizon would be lauded for its resolution boost alone, what we like about the title's presentation is that Guerrilla has accepted that it's not just the pixel-count alone that matters - more is required to deliver a great 4K presentation. With that in mind, we were really happy to see improvements to resolution on some textures. Also worthy of praise is a marked increase in texture filtering quality. Lower levels of anisotropic filtering on base hardware can stand out on a 1080p image - but the effect is much more pronounced at 4K. Thankfully this is not an issue with Horizon.\nThe PS4 Pro version features improved texture filtering and higher resolution textures. Look closely at the snowy ground direct to the right of Aloy as well as the ropes to her left.\nThe benefits of improved texture filtering are even more evident in this scene. More detail is visible within textured surfaces on the PS4 Pro.\nThe higher resolution improves the appearance of foliage. Also, if you look closely around the fire, you'll notice a few minor artefacts produced by the checkerboard rendering technique.\nThis wide-open area showcases the benefit of the higher resolution. Distant detail is sharper across the entire image on PS4 Pro.\nWe're still working on our main Horizon Zero Dawn coverage (expect much more later in the week), but it's worth pointing out that even this performance analysis article needs further work in order to be considered complete and final. Late last week, Sony revealed that an upcoming 'day zero' patch - which is not yet available to press - will allow Pro users to choose between the checkerboard 4K mode, or else a new performance-orientated option.\nThe link between Kylo Ren's Lightsaber and KOTOR Malachor blimey! This new mode redirects Pro power towards a higher frame-rate - exactly the kind of thing we've seen on the inFamous and Rise of the Tomb Raider PS4 Pro updates. There's no promise of 60fps in the Sony notes - merely mention of smoother frame-rates - so we will report back on what the performance mode actually delivers as soon as we can. However, we can confirm that the patch will available by the time the game launches.\nThe ability to choose between resolution and higher performance may well be the icing on the cake, on what is already a technologically outstanding title. However, even without the new mode, the combination of brilliant art design, great performance and a sublime 4K presentation make this the most impressive PlayStation 4 Pro title we've seen so far. But at the same time, it's clear that base hardware hasn't been left behind - Horizon is an equally impressive achievement for the standard PS4 too.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/qTH8OnQKWeY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJCKkbV80ts"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:23:47.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
