Cowboys star Matt Scott is fighting a shoulder charge despite being injured. Source: AAP \nWith a clean record, Taumalolo stood to miss just one game — Saturday night’s clash with Manly — if he took the early guilty plea. \nHe will now cop a two-week suspension if he’s found guilty of the shoulder charge. \nMeanwhile, Matt Scott will also fight a shoulder charge ban at the judiciary after he was cited for a hit on Korbin Sims. \nScott has been ruled out for the season after suffering an ACL injury, but by pleading not guilty to the charge he will ensure there are no carry over points hanging over his head when he returns to the field next year. \nLive stream the Cowboys’ round three clash with Manly on FOX SPORTS.
