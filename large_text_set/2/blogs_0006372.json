The Philadelphia rapper used the social media network to preview a track of a track that could signal the arrival of his anticipated Dreamchasers 4.5 release. \nIn the Instagram clip, Meek captioned the video “Bottom Music ‘Black Rose,'” but there wasn’t much context beyond that. What could be determined, however, was that the song drew some inspiration from Trayvon Martin by way of the references in the lyrics. Over a slow track enhanced by a horn sample and vocal sample, Meek can be seen rhyming along with the track inside a studio playback session. \n“Skittles bouncing off the ground same time the blood drop/And they wondering why we killing, shit, I wish we would stop/How the judge gon’ judge me, when love don’t love me/My cell is getting cold and my future looking ugly/The mailman coming on the first, them kids hungry/Mommy on crack, daddy dead, them kids lonely,” raps Meek while onlookers inside the studio bobbed their heads in unison. \nBack in November, Meek promised that Dreamchasers 4.5 would be coming soon, but nothing except this recent teaser and a previous clip from last month that was posted to his Instagram page. There still isn’t an official release date for the project.
