The investigators claimed that the plane crash was caused by terrorists based on traces of explosives found on the body of some of the bodies. However, some French investigators think that the co-pilot’s iPad mini 4 or iPhone 6s might be the culprit behind the fire that led to the plane crashing. \nThey claim that the data recovered from the black box indicates a fire broke out near the plane’s cockpit that eventually led to it crashing. The fire may have been caused by an iPad mini 4 or iPhone 6s exploding which was kept on top of the instrument panel by the co-pilot, as a video from Charles de Gaulle airport indicates. This is the same area from where the first batch of automatic warning messages were triggered. Since the iPhone 6s and iPad mini 4 were kept on top of the instrument panel, they might have been exposed to harsh sunlight for an extended period of time triggering “ thermal runaway ” resulting in a fire. \nThe theory behind the iPhone 6s and iPad mini 4 causing the plane crash does sound dubious, though. Alongside the lack of proof, air safety expert David Learmount says that “pilots don’t leave objects on the dashboard because they know they will end up in their lap when they take off or on the floor and they’ll get airborne in turbulence and could jam the controls.” He also adds that the fires in the toilet and cockpit occurred too quickly to blame the fire caused due to the battery exploding in the cockpit. \nApple has already issued an official statement on the matter stating that it has not been contacted by an investigating agency regarding this event. \n“We haven’t been contacted by GTA or any authority investigating this tragic event. We have not seen the report but we understand there is no evidence to link this event to Apple products. If investigators have questions for us, we would of course assist in any way we can. We rigorously test our products to ensure they meet or exceed international safety standards.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T06:27:53.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
