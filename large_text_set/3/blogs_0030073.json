They have four children together — KJ , 5, Kash , 4, and 3-year-old twins Kaia and Kane . \nKroy also adopted Kim’s children from previous relationships — Brielle , 20, and Ariana , 16. \nThe couple went on their belated honeymoon in 2015, and shared a sexy snap for her fourth wedding anniversary later that year. \nThe former Real Housewives of Atlanta star has continued to share naked snaps of her husband on social media since, despite her daughters’ disapproval — and they even packed on the PDA during a recent vacation. \nPHOTOS: Like Mother, Like Daughter!

He was only in New York for two short weeks before he was cut again and returned home. \nKim has since expressed her desire to have a sixth child , telling RadarOnline.com exclusively that the timing would be perfect “when Kroy isn’t in the NFL and [she’s] not filming every day.” \n“It would be nice to have a baby and enjoy it,” she explained. “I dream it would be so nice to have a baby and just go home and relax.” \nStay with Radar for more. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:37:52.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
