Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer opened today’s briefing by outlining President Trump’s recent executive orders, and among them is an EO that seeks to strip certain federal funds to cities providing sanctuary to people in the country illegally in violation of federal law: Sean Spicer announces Trump will sign executive order today stripping federal funding from so-called \"sanctuary cities.\" \n— Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) January 25, 2017 Spicer says Trump plans to strip federal funding from \"sanctuary cities.\" There are about 200 cities in U.S that fall under the distinction. \n— Miranda Green (@Mirandacgreen) January 25, 2017 . @PressSec says Trump administration will \"strip federal grant money from sanctuary states and cities\" that harbor undocumented immigrants. pic.twitter.com/vAOhL9V7cs \n— CBS News (@CBSNews) January 25, 2017 . @PressSec : The American people will no longer be forced to subsidize a disregard for our laws. pic.twitter.com/9P0mXcD6MT \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 25, 2017 \nReaction from the Left side of the issue: Predictable: Defunding sanctuary cities is not an attack on illegal immigrants–it is an attack on Americans who don't agree with the president. \n— David Rothkopf (@djrothkopf) January 25, 2017 Picking a fight on sanctuary cities is substantively gross but probably good politics for the Trump coalition. \n— Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) January 25, 2017 Us blue states should stop subsidizing red states. Maybe blue states should just stop paying federal income taxes. https://t.co/uwedCx4BpZ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T21:27:46.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
