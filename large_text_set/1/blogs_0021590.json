Some of us in different ways than others, but still, it’s about improvement. It doesn’t mean you’re not going to slack sometimes, and sometimes you’ll totally fall off and quit. Sometimes you don’t even really try! There’s some stuff, though, you really should give a shot. But you probably won't. Bummer. But still try! Fitness Equipment \nvia GIPHY \nYou need to exercise! Don’t worry, it’s not about weight, which is largely genetic, making it a not-so-great indicator of your overall health. BUT even mild exercise can be a huge life changer for you, and going to the gym can be a huge pain. So you go buy yourself some home gym stuff, maybe an elliptical, or even some free weights! \n... And they'll just sit there gathering dust. It turns out it’s not the gym that’s hard to go to, it’s the actual act of exercising that can be a huge chore. Day Planner \nvia GIPHY \nHey, do you know what’s good to have planned out? Your day! Odds are good that your memory is not so God-like that you can always remember everything you have to do. Having it all written down in the same spot, then, can be a life-saver. \nOf course, most of us don’t grow up using a day planner, so by the time we’re adults, we’re not conditioned to write things down in a hard schedule. Thus, our beautiful, leather-bound day planners end up under a pile of fast food wrappers in your car. A Bus Pass/Metro Card \nvia GIPHY \nTake public transit; the city you live in can use the money, and you usually end up getting some extra exercise (you gotta walk to and from the stop, as well as your destination, most likely). Plus, maintaining a car is really expensive. \nBut you keep using a car because it's more convenient. The freedom of a car is incredible, so I get it, but you know what you can’t do while you drive? Read. (I mean, hopefully…) Preventative Healthcare \nvia GIPHY \nGod willing, you have some form of health insurance. And if you do, one of the things that’s probably covered is preventative care, like check-ups and general screening-kind of stuff. Of course, we’re all conditioned to go to the doctor when we’re sick, but going when we’re not sick is a great way to stay not sick. It’s like taking your car to the mechanic for an oil changes — you don’t want to go only when the thing breaks down. A Checkbook \nvia GIPHY \nWhen you opened your checking account, the bank gave you a thing to keep track of your purchases. USE IT! KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE! Sure, you can usually check online, but things take a while to post there, and writing down your spending immediately after you buy something means you won’t have to worry that the gas station you went to doesn’t post their purchases for like THREE DAYS come ON . Your Breathing \nvia GIPHY \nThis isn't hippy stuff — practicing breathing techniques can change how you feel. It’s pretty nuts how much is tied into your breathing, and if you just take some time to work on it, you’ll find that maybe you’re not an angry, then crying, complete and total mess. \nIt’s tough out there, we’ve got to look out for ourselves! Which technique are you gonna use? Let us know on Twitter !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T05:02:18.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
