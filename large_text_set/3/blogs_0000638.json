It’s not just lunch,” says Tracy Santicola of Moon. \n“We should have tables for people to sit out and enjoy themselves without worrying about drug dealing,” says Brenda Banks of Robinson. \nThe problem at Market Square is obvious to many. \n“People are just sitting there all day. You come through a couple times a day and the same people are sitting in the same spots, so yeah there’s a problem,” says Jim Coyne of Shaler. \nZappala says, as a consequence, the drug use and dealing there has gotten worse. \nThe Market Square Merchants Association supports the plan. \n“I don’t think it’s a solution to the problem, but it’s a step in the right direction,” says Mitcham. \nMayor Peduto is not so sure. \n“It’s not about tables. The tables aren’t causing a disruption. It’s about when people become intoxicated and become either loud or get into physical altercations,” says the mayor. \nMarket Square merchants say a greater police presence would help. \n“Years ago we used to have a beat cop. He knew certain individuals on the Square that would be up to no good,” notes Mitcham. \nThat could happen again, especially with a new police zone downtown. \n“What we would look at is having a North Shore, Strip District, Downtown, Southside zone to be able to deal with the fluctuations that happen with heavy weekend, heavy nighttime enforcement,” said Peduto. \nPeduto thinks this year at Market Square will not be a repeat of the last. \n“I think the increased police presence that you’re seeing downtown has had an effect.” Jon Delano facebook Follow Jon Delano is a familiar face on KDKA-TV, having been the station's political analyst since 1994.
