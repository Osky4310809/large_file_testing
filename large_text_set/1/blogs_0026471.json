I want them to see I‚Äôm fabulous. Don‚Äôt give me a job because I‚Äôm a girl. It‚Äôs condescending,\" Hayek reportedly said, before Shirley MacLaine chimed in and challenged others to uncover their \"core identity.\"\nWilliams challenged these with her own perspective. ‚ÄúMy question is: What if you are a person of color, or a transgendered [sic] person who ‚Äî just from how you look ‚Äî you already are in a conflict?,\" she asked. MacLaine then reportedly told her to \"change her point of view of being victimized.\"\nThe tense exchange went on, with Hayek encouraging Williams to try to identify as someone other than a black woman.\n‚ÄúWho are you when you‚Äôre not black and you‚Äôre not a woman?\" Hayek said. \"Who are you and what have you got to give?‚Äù\n\"A lot. But some days, I‚Äôm just black, and I‚Äôm just a woman,‚Äù Williams responded. ‚ÄúLike, it‚Äôs not my choice. I know who I am. I know I‚Äôm Jessica, and I‚Äôm the hottest bitch on the planet I know.\"\nIn response, Hayek (who was born in Mexico) asked Williams to accept identity as a choice.\nAs Times reporter Amy Quote: :\nWilliams, visibly uncomfortable, said she also wanted to encourage all of the women in the room to pay special attention to women of color and LGBT women. ‚ÄúI think we need to not speak over black women,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúnot assign them labels.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat does this mean, ‚Äòspeak over?‚Äô‚Äù Hayek asked.\n‚ÄúTo project your ideas on me,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúI think there is a fear that if we present an idea that, ‚ÄòHey, maybe [black women] have it a little bit harder in this country‚Äô ‚Äî because we do; black women and trans women do ‚Äî if we‚Äôre having it a little bit harder, it doesn‚Äôt invalidate your experience. I really am begging you to not take it personally.‚Äù\nThe conversation continued with others chiming in to support Williams' point that different women deal with the weight of a wide range of experiences ‚Äî and the importance of acknowledging the burdens and experiences of black women through an intersectional framework, not victimization.\nThe full text, which you can read here , sparked a dialogue on Twitter, particularly from black women who tweeted in support of Williams.\n@msjwilly bless you.\n‚Äî Issa Rae (@IssaRae) January 29, 2017\nJFC.
