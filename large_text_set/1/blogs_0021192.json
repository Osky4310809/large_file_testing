Is it lack of exercise due to frigid weather? Overindulgence in soul-warming carbs and sweet treats? Overexposure to too many relatives who forget to wash their hands? \nAs a parent, it's one thing if I get sick, but it's an entirely different situation when the whole family is under the weather. And as a mom of two, I'm always concerned with taking the necessary precautions to keep my boys happy and healthy. This means fueling their bodies with real, nutrient-dense foods and surrounding them with an artillery of safe self-care products to keep their defense systems in tiptop shape. \nKai and Leo are two active, energetic, curious boys who want to know the \"whys\" behind everything. So I've come up with strategies for incorporating wellness practices and remedies into their daily and nightly routines without getting questioned every step of the way. It's a sickness-busting tool kit filled with superfoods and a variety of Maty's natural and organic products—favorites that my boys have come to know and love, and oh-so-helpful for when they are feeling under the weather! Tamara Muth-King 1. Be a little sneaky! \nWhen it comes to food, I like to add Maty's cough syrup to tons of things the kids eat in the fall and winter months when they're coming down with colds, as it has 10 different whole-food, immune-boosting ingredients per serving. The taste is great, and it blends wonderfully into smoothies, pancakes, yogurt, and applesauce, making parenting a cinch. No more bribing the kids to take their medicine when I can just sneak it into their meals! 2. Make bath time work double duty. \nIf the boys can't shake off the congestion, I take extra-special care with their nighttime routines to ensure that they are able to get some much-needed sleep. This typically includes aromatherapy or essential oil rubs, as they are gentle, clarifying, and unbelievably soothing. I love dripping eucalyptus and peppermint oils into their baths to help un-stuff those unbearable stuffy noses. Plus, they get to absorb all of that yumminess. I'll also let the boys sit in my sister's handmade detox soak, made with sea salt and baking soda, which is totally safe for kids. Tamara Muth-King 3. Engage all the senses in the get-better regimen. \nAfter bath time, I rub Maty's soothing vapor rub onto their chests, which has healthy oils (including eucalyptus and peppermint, which I mentioned above) for relief while also strengthening their immune systems! Then, I make sure to give them Maty's all-natural nighttime cough syrup to help suppress their symptoms. It contains chamomile and nutmeg to safely and naturally soothe my boys to sleep, so mom can rest easy, too! Once the boys are in bed and tucked in, as a last step I put essential oils in Kai and Leo's diffuser so that beautiful, clean air can be pumped into their room for restful, uninterrupted sleep. Tamara Muth-King 4. Keep it natural, but make sure it’s effective. \nSo why do I use natural remedies for my little ones? It’s a practice that is extremely familiar to me. My mom is a holistic nurse practitioner, and I grew up appreciating and taking homeopathic medicines, flower essences, essential oils, and other natural forms of healing. This was how my journey was impacted, in every part of who I was from a very young age, and I'm committed to introducing my children to the same practices that have brought me so much comfort, in sickness and in health. \nTo me, health is a state of mind that starts with internal decisions to care for your body and live well. But sometimes our bodies and immune systems need a little extra help, and sometimes Mom needs a second pair of hands. This is why I love using brands that utilize whole foods and ingredients that can be found in nature, like Maty's . It gives me peace of mind to know that when my boys are down for the count, I can still rely on clean, natural products to help them bounce back in no time and return to their playful, vibrant selves.
