Rather, Bayelsa State Government, as led by Governor Dickson, will not only apologize to Ijaw people, but will have to bring back our land.” \nIn a joint statement, NDSWON, IPDI and FHRAAC said: “The governor should not, by his anti-people policies, endanger the future of Bayelsans, particularly the host communities at Bayelsa Palm Plantation. It is either Governor Dickson rescinds his bobby trap of donating lands to the Fulanis or we will join our foremost activist, Ms Briggs and other well meaning Niger Deltans to peacefully protest against the governor’s decision. \n“We have been inundated with the news currently going viral that the Bayelsa State Government has donated a whopping 1,200 hectares of land at Bayelsa Palm Plantation to the Fulani herdsmen for grazing purposes. \n“We may not necessarily have problem with the governor giving out lands to people in the exercise of his statutory duties. Our concern is that it should not be Fulani herdsmen, known for terrorizing their host communities across the country that the few lands in the state should be allocated to, if he chooses to give out any portion to any Nigerian. History is replete with antecedents of these murderous Fulani invaders, who come to any community as friends, but later turn out to be thorns in the flesh of their hosts. \n“The biggest threats to human survival in Nigeria are Fulani herdsmen. They are everywhere massacring other Nigerians in their thousands, particularly those communities who gave lands to them. Allocating lands to the Fulani people for whatsoever purposes is like inviting the proverbial ant-ridden fagot to Bayelsa State, which will inevitably bring lizards to the land. \n“This is a kiss of death and we reject the governor’s initiative in its entirety. There cannot be any gain commensurate to the dangers ahead. Governor Dickson and the retinue of his self-serving political buccaneers may not be alive to experience the macabre dance.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:29:41.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
