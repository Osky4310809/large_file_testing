This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe.”\nEven if that’s an accurate reflection of Trump’s intention, it’s clear a majority of people in America and around the world disagree with the decision. Attorney Generals in more than a dozen states have lodged official protests against the move and courts in several states have issued injunctions against it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T11:27:27.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
