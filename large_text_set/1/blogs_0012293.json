The latest to make over one of Drizzy’s tunes is the xx, who covered “Too Good” during an appearance on BBC 1 Radio 1’s Live Lounge. The British band successfully meshed their chill, electronic vibes with the lovelorn lyrics and the resulting cover of the singer/rapper’s dancehall-sampling Views song with Rihanna is pretty, mellow and sweet.\nIn the similar laid-back spirit of Nelly Furtado’s “Too Good” cover , The xx replaced Drake’s dance beat with a slowed-down tempo to match the sentiment of the song, and it’s totally working for us.\n“We love this song,” Oliver Sim said of Drake and Rih’s original. “We have taken it to a different place — it’s maybe not as danceable, but we hope you enjoy it.” The energy we expend grooving to the original version was spent processing all of the emotions we felt while listening to The xx’s performance. The group also performed “On Hold,” the new single off their recently released LP I See You .\nPreviously, the xx announced plans on Instagram for a European tour, which starts February 8. And as Rolling Stone reports, you can also catch the band on their North American tour , which begins on April 14th with a Coachella performance and runs through late May.\nToday, we’re so excited to announce our North American tour. It’s been 3 years since we’ve played in the states and we can’t wait to see our friends and fans in the US and Canada this spring! xx The xx ⠀⠀ ⠀ Sign up at thexx.info/tour for access to the fan pre-sale.
