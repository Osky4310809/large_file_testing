Are you knowingly spreading false information?” \nSmith followed that up by invoking fake news, which led Todd to fire back. \n“I know this was not your intent,” the MSNBC personality said. “I’ve known you a long time, but you just published fake news.” \nSmith responded that it was unfair and that he thinks “people love to throw the term fake news around.” \nWatch how the rest of the interview went above, via MSNBC. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:39:28.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
