Witnesses said the man's upper body heaved for at least 13 minutes. \nIn his legal challenge, Arthur said a better alternative would be a sedative known as pentobarbital. Used by itself, the drug is now the most common method of execution in the United States. Even the firing squad would be better than midazolam, Arthur said. \nHe also said the state's method for testing whether an inmate was unconscious, by pinching him on the arm, is unreliable because prison staff members were never trained in how to use the proper amount of force. \nA federal appeals court ruled against him, holding that challenges to a method of execution can propose only an alternative available under that state's law. Arthur appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted a stay of execution in November to allow him and the state to file additional documents. \nBut on Tuesday, the court declined to take the case in a brief order issued without explanation. That clears the way for Alabama to set a new execution date. \nJustices Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Steven Breyer, dissented, saying today's action issues \"a macabre challenge. In order to successfully attack a state's method of execution, a condemned prisoner must not only prove that the state's chosen method risks severe pain, but must also propose a known and available alternative method for his own execution.\" \nNow 74, Arthur was sentenced to death for a murder in 1982. Prosecutors said a woman with whom he was having an affair gave him $10,000 to kill her husband. After Arthur's first two convictions were reversed, he was found guilty again in 1991 and has pursued repeated appeals since then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:06:17.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
