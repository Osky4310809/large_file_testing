And Watson just responded to the sheer-top criticism in the most perfect of ways.\nIf you’re in need of some catching up, no worries — we’ve got you covered. Watson appeared in a recent Vanity Fair photo shoot donning several extremely gorgeous outfits — one of which featured a semi-sheer top that revealed a portion of her breasts. The shoot was high-fashion and elegance at its finest, and in our opinions, Watson CRUSHED it. The accompanying interview discussed her role as a U.N. ambassador, her intention to create empowered female characters, and some of her thoughts on contemporary feminism.\nHOWEVER, Watson has since received some major heat for her decision to wear a top that showed some skin, with the internet peanut gallery posting things like:\nEmma Watson: \"Feminism, feminism... gender wage gap... why oh why am I not taken seriously... feminism... oh, and here are my tits!\" pic.twitter.com/gb7OvxzRH9 \n— Julia Hartley-Brewer (@JuliaHB1) March 1, 2017 But Watson just released the following statement : “It just always reveals to me how many misconceptions and what a misunderstanding there is about what feminism is. Feminism is about giving women choice. Feminism is not a stick with which to beat other women with. It’s about freedom, it’s about liberation, it’s about equality. I really don’t know what my tits have to do with it. It’s very confusing,” she told Reuters.” via GIPHY \nWe are literally cheering. And also (like Emma), we’re getting exasperated over the many misconceptions over what feminism actually means . A woman feeling comfortable enough in her own skin to show her body on her own terms — without shame, fear of punishment, or judgement — is in no way antithetical to equality among the sexes (how many bare-chested men have you seen in or on the cover of magazines in the last week? Let alone the past year!).\nAs Watson so eloquently said, feminism is about choice — and that means supporting the right for other women to make informed decisions for themselves, even if its not the choice you might personally make. (Also, can we all take a moment to remember that half the world’s population has boobs, and it’s probably time everyone stopped freaking out about them? Pretty please?).\nAt any rate, we think Emma Watson looked utterly stunning in all her Vanity Fair photos, and we so appreciate all she does to empower women on a literal daily basis. Keep up the good fight, Emma! We’re behind you, forever and always!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T19:03:28.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
