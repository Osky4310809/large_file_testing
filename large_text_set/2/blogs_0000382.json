Detroit Pistons big-man Aron Baynes. Source: AP \nARON BAYNES COULD BE ON THE MOVE \nAron Baynes’ minutes have slowly diminished as the regular season has progressed, so it’s no surprise to see that the Pistons have placed him on the trade block, according to Basketball Insiders’ Michael Scotto . \nSources confirmed to foxsports.com.au that all signs are pointing to Baynes opting out of his player option at the end of the season, making the Australian big-man a free agent. \nBaynes earned his first DNP-CD of the season during the Pistons’ loss to the Boston Celtics, leading to this recent trade talk being relatively unsurprising. \nAnalysis : Baynes hasn’t been getting the minutes that he, perhaps, deserves, so it makes sense for the Pistons to look to get rid of his expiring contract. The big-man could have the opportunity to help a playoff team, should he be traded to one, with the ability to bolster a frontcourt with his championship experience. \nCAVALIERS AMP UP SEARCH FOR ‘PLAYMAKER’ \nLeBron James has made it crystal clear that he wants the Cavaliers front office to bring in a playmaker , and it appears they’ve obliged. \nThe Cavaliers brought veteran point guards Mario Chalmers, Jordan Farmar, and Kirk Hinrich, and wing Lance Stephenson in for a workout on Wednesday (local time), with the players essentially trialling for a spot on the team, according to ESPN. Lance Stephenson. Source: Getty Images \nA short time later, Sam Amick of USA Today confirmed that the Cavaliers have a desire to trade for Mavericks point guard Deron Williams. \nThat report also reveals that the Mavericks have interest in Cavaliers guard Iman Shumpert, setting the table for a potential trade between the two teams. \nAnalysis : The Cavaliers have been in need of a secondary playmaker since Matthew Dellavedova left town, and three of the four options make sense in that regard. Chalmers and Farmar are veteran point guards with championship experience, while Hinrich is also an extremely capable option. Stephenson is the unknown, but his athleticism and ability to get into the lane could be a welcome addition to this Cavs squad. \nSERGE IBAKA IS ON THE TRADE BLAKA \nThe Orlando Magic have recently become more intent on trading big-man Serge Ibaka, according to Sporting News’ Sean Deveney . \nIbaka has put up admirable numbers, but, with the desire to develop Aaron Gordon as a power forward, the team is looking to move their newly-acquired shot-blocker. Orlando Magic forward Serge Ibaka. Source: AP \nAt this point, no suitors have emerged as a potential landing spot for Ibaka. \nAnalysis : The Magic won’t be making the playoffs, and don’t appear to have the core to do that in the future. That is, unless, they focus on someone like Gordon. It makes all the sense in the world to make sure the development of their young forward is a top priority. \nWILL BUTLER STAY A BULL? \nIt seems odd to think the Chicago Bulls would trade their best player, but that may be what ends up happening. \nAccording to the Chicago Tribune’s K.C. Johnson , rival executives believe the Bulls and Celtics are set to rekindle trade talks centred on Jimmy Butler. \nThe teams had trade talks in June, where the Celtics off Jae Crowder, Marcus Smarts, and the Nets’ first round picks in 2017 and 2018; all assets that the team still has. Jimmy Butler. Source: AFP \nLast week’s drama may act as a catalyst, and if the Bulls’ season begins to fall off the rails — they have a tough road trip coming up — then the trade talks could become more serious. \nAnalysis: It really does seem counterintuitive for the Bulls to trade Butler. If they really are looking to rebuild, then getting the Nets’ 2017 and 2018 picks would be a good place to start. Unless the Bulls can get significant assets (preferably young assets) in return, then trading Butler would be a big mistake. \nKNICKS STILL PURSUING KEVIN LOVE \nEarlier this week, the New York Knicks attempted to trade Carmelo Anthony to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kevin Love. \nThe Cavaliers said no, but the Knicks won’t back down. Kevin Love. Source: AFP \nAccording to ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne and Marc Stein, the Knicks have continued to pursue Love, with the hopes of getting rid of Anthony. \nThe report claims that the Cavaliers do have an interest in Anthony, a three-time gold medallist, but are unwilling to part with one third of their ‘Big 3”. \nAnthony has a no-trade clause on his contract, so the Knicks are looking toward teams that may be attractive for the All-Star, with the Los Angeles Clippers and Boston Celtics also emerging as potential suitors. \nAnalysis: From a purely basketball perspective, an Anthony-for-Love trade could work for both teams, but, for a Cavaliers side coming off a title, it may not be the best idea to shake things up so dramatically.
