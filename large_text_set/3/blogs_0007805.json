EDD GUMBAN \nMANILA, Philippines - When Congress adjourns for a two-month break next week, Environment Secretary Gina Lopez will end up being bypassed by the Commission on Appointments (CA). \nSen. Panfilo Lacson, a member of the CA, said that since Lopez has indicated that she will be out of the country next week because of a scheduled trip to the United States, she will not be around to attend the meetings of the CA. Congress adjourns session on Wednesday. \n“On Tuesday, the committee will meet in caucus in an executive session to deliberate and possibly vote to recommend her confirmation to the plenary,” Lacson said. “Since Secretary Lopez will be out of the country on a personal trip and we won’t have plenary sessions anymore, then she is deemed bypassed.” \nHe explained that the decision that will be made on Tuesday would only be at the committee level and would have to be taken up by the CA as a whole later on. \nBased on the rules of the CA, an appointee is deemed bypassed if his or her appointment is not acted upon by the CA when Congress adjourns session. \nOnce this happens, the President will have to reappoint Lopez if he wants her to stay on as environment secretary.   \nIf Lopez is bypassed by the CA, it could be counted as her “first strike” under the newly approved “three-strike” rule of the CA. \nUnder the new rule, the CA will be forced to vote on confirming or rejecting an appointee who has been bypassed three times. \nThe CA committee on environment and natural resources headed by Sen. Manny Pacquiao could also decide to reject the appointment of Lopez, just like what happened with foreign secretary-designate Perfecto Yasay Jr. last Wednesday. \nWith the rejection of Yasay’s appointment by the CA, his stint as secretary of foreign affairs effectively ended. Malacañang made no attempt to appeal the ruling of the CA and instead named career diplomat Enrique Manalo as acting secretary of foreign affairs. \nLopez has faced strong opposition from the mining industry because of her decision to close the operations of 23 mining firms, including several of the biggest in the country. \nOver 20 objectors to Lopez’s appointment were heard by the CA last Wednesday and Thursday as part of her confirmation process. They accused her of arbitrarily shutting down the operations of these firms without the benefit of due process. \nBut Lopez has stood firm on her decision, saying that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has the sole authority to regulate the operations of the mining industry. Lopez: The same old questions \nLopez also expressed disappointment on the kind of questions thrown at her during her confirmation hearing before the CA. \nLopez yesterday maintained that the closure of mines would not result in job losses that could adversely affect the lives of residents dependent on mining. \n“I was a bit disappointed. I already answered those questions on how to provide jobs or livelihood for those who will be affected by the mine closure. From day 1, I’ve been explaining how we will conduct rehabilitation of mined-out areas. They are just repeating the questions I’ve been asked before,” Lopez said in an interview. \n“This can be done. In fact, there is already a multi-agency, P4-billion investment in three provinces that will be affected by mine closures. This will involve Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur and the Dinagat Islands. We have funding for that,” she added. \nShe also lamented that in the two-day CA hearing, those given the chance to speak were all her objectors. \n“They allowed these three or four NGOs that were against my leadership at the department. How about the more than 20 groups supporting me? Why weren’t they given a chance? You are just hearing one side of the issue,” she said. \n“What I’m saying is that not all mining is bad, but if it causes damage and harm to life then it should not operate.” \n“I will go to the US not for a vacation but for a retreat. This is a yearly thing for me,” she added. Mining firms confident of Lopez rejection \nMeanwhile, mining firms have expressed confidence that the CA will reject Lopez, saying that she was not able to convince members of the committee. \nIn a briefing yesterday, the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines (COMP) said Lopez failed to persuade and justify her side as she faced strong opposition from various groups from the business sector, the mining industry, indigenous peoples and from some CA members during her two-day confirmation hearing at the Senate. \n“We are 90 percent sure (that she will be rejected). The Chamber is confident that she was not able to convince the committee,” COMP chairman Artemio Disini said. \n“I think the legislators who asked questions, many of them were not convinced. I think we have an even chance,” COMP Legal and Policy vice president Ronald Recidoro added. \nWhile Lopez’s fate remains hanging, the Chamber said that should the CA reject her appointment, the President should not reappoint her as environment secretary. \nDisini said the appointment of Lopez should be rejected because it is hurting the Philippine economy. \n“We are looking at $4-billion losses in the annual revenue, investments of at least $22 billion gone and employment probably we will be losing about five million, all in all affected would range, including families, 10 million,” Disini said. \nDisini argued that mining firms have been existing in the Philippines since 1936, long before overseas Filipino workers generated revenues for the country. The mining industry is also providing the government about P35 billion to P40 billion in revenue. \n“When will we get the present revenue that we are getting now of about P30 billion to P40 billion from the mining industry (if Lopez will be confirmed)?” Disini said. \n“We are calling on the President and the CA to just end this suffering. We are hoping for the decision by Tuesday and her rejection by Wednesday. And we are calling on the President to not reappoint her,” Recidoro said. \n“It is imperative that Lopez be rejected and be replaced by someone who understands natural resource management and can bring our resources out of the ground and for the benefit of everybody,” he added. \nHe claimed that the past two CA hearings showed what kind of leader Lopez is. \n“We had the glimpse of the kind of leadership she wants to bring in to the DENR. She is not competent for the job and she’s heavily reliant on consultants. Her imbalance is very obvious as she can disregard the country’s natural resources,” Recidoro claimed \nStakeholders said that the mining industry cannot really work together with Lopez should she be confirmed as environment secretary. \n“The industry is in peril and will experience no growth. It’s a big disservice if we will not be able to utilize our mineral wealth,” Recidoro said. \nRecidoro clarified that he is not personally against Lopez and does not question her passion for her advocacy to protect the environment. He just finds her unfit for the DENR. \n“I might endorse her as tourism secretary, but as DENR secretary, she is unfit,” he added. \nEngineer and geologists group StandFIRM also said that Lopez lacks scientific and technical knowledge to lead the DENR. \nThe Chamber claimed that Lopez is painting the mining industry as an “environmental rapist” that just take what they want and leave nothing but suffering and destruction. \nReferring to the law, the group said Lopez has a duty to enforce the Mining Act and her non-implementation, particularly on the issuance, monitoring and regulation of contracts, should be a ground for her non-confirmation. – With Louise Maureen Simeon, Robertzon Ramirez, Rhodina Villanueva  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:29:11.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
