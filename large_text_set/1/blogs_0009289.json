But it’s never that easy when it comes to the Steelers and injuries, of course. Ben Roethlisberger says he hurt ankle on second to last play. Said he's \"always worried,\" but promises \"I'll be out there next week.\" \n— Aditi Kinkhabwala (@AKinkhabwala) January 8, 2017 \nRoethlisberger was still in the game with the Steelers up 30-12 with just under five minutes remaining. On 3rd-and-9 from the Miami 44-yard line, Roethlisberger was pressure and pulled down as he threw what would he his final pass — an interception by Dolphins corner Xavien Howard. View photo .

(AP) \nYou can see in the video above how Roethlisberger takes a moment to get up, but as he comes on the field he’s flexing and stretching his shoulder while walking slowly toward the sideline. Then Roethlisberger came out a few minutes later for the end-of-game kneeldown to close it out. \nWhy was Ben even out there? It was a three-score game at that point. Did Mike Tomlin not want to turn it over to backup Landry Jones at that point? \nAccording to Yahoo Sports’ Eric Adelson, Roethlisberger was in a walking boot after the game. The Steelers head to Arrowhead Stadium to face the Kansas City Chiefs, a team they beat in Pittsburgh 43-14 in Week 4. \nAnd just when we thought Roethlisberger and the rest of the offense was humming at full health, he gets hurt again. Then again, he’s one of the toughest players in the game today — and we take him at his word, even now, that he plans to play against the Chiefs. – – – – – – – \nEric Edholm is a writer for Shutdown  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T00:32:52.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
