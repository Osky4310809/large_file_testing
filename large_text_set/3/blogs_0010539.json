That‚Äôs right, Murray welcomed a second child with wife Sarah Roemer , and we‚Äôre feeling giddy with delight. The couple are notoriously private, so we don‚Äôt yet have a name (their son is almost two years old , and we still don‚Äôt know his!).\nBUT we can confirm it‚Äôs a baby girl, and her adorable little baby fingers are currently featured in Murray‚Äôs Instagram photos . Well, one photo. Wanna take a look?\nDon't worry little girl you can hold on as tight as you want for as long as you want, I'm already yours & I'll never let go I've now two incredible women in my life.

I‚Äôve now two incredible women in my life. My son & I are two lucky guys,‚Äù he captioned the pic. A . Huge congratulations to the happy couple! They are ALL lucky to have each other. And Roemer is probably relieved to have given birth, because you know, pregnancy .\nYou know Ur pregnant when u tear up in the opening fight scene of Logan saving the little girl. Grt movie! ü§ó #datenight @WolverineMovie \n‚Äî Sarah Roemer (@sarahroemer) March 6, 2017 Seriously, these kids can boast that they have a badass mom who includes ‚Äúmermaid‚Äù in her professional description on Twitter, and an actor dad who writes romance novels in his spare time and portrays a famous musical legend in CMT‚Äôs ‚ÄúSun Records‚Äù . Jealous, much?\nUp & at em! Cardio day... ooof. Took some time away from Social Media. Good to see all your smiling faces. #90MinRun #BuffaloBlue #FastingSocialMediaIsHealthy \nA post shared by Chad Murray (@chadmurray15) on Jan 18, 2017 at 6:20am PST \nAnd we love how dedicated Murray is to being a good role-model for his two children. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight last year, he talked about what it means to be a father. \n‚ÄúHaving a family just changes your perspective on everything. I mean it‚Äôs a world-changer. For me, it was the greatest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. Having kids is a game-changer, and I think you‚Äôre always walking around with the mentality that you want to make sure that they‚Äôre proud, and you want to represent them well and just be a great leader.‚Äù \nSW N.\nvia GIPHY We look forward to more photos of their little girl, and send so many best wishes in the meantime.
