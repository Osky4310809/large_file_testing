Marvel Fans Jamie Lovett Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of \nActor Finn Jones is about to make the jump from one major fandom to another. Jones spent six years on Game of Thrones playing the Knight of Flowers, Ser Loras Tyrell. This year he’ll take on the Marvel Cinematic Universe role of Danny Rand first in Marvel’s Iron Fist in March, and then again in Marvel’s The Defenders . Jones’s journey from Westeros to Marvel’s New York City began the day he finishing shooting his final Game of Thrones scenes. UP NEXT: New Defenders Photos Released \n“ It was the last day of Game of Thrones, and I was traveling back to the airport, and I got an email from my agents for this audition for ‘Kick’ [the code name for Iron Fist ], and at first I thought it was going to be a football show, and I hate football, but I was like, ‘Okay, I’ll take a look at it,;” Jones recalls to Entertainment Weekly . “It was right after Game of Thrones , and I was thinking, ‘Wow, I’ve been doing this show for six years. What’s gonna be next?’ And I opened it up and I saw it was actually something for Marvel and I started to read the character description and I remember it vividly, I remember reading it and just having this deep, deep sense that this was the next thing I’m going to do.” \nJoining the Marvel Cinematic Universe means adjusting to a new set of fans. According to Jones, who is himself a fan of George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones novels, the Marvel fanbase outstrips Game of Thrones fans in terms of pure passion. \n“I find the comic book audience a lot more intense than the fantasy one, definitely,” Jones says. “It’s been cool. There’s been a great response when I’ve been out and about and people realize I’m playing Iron Fist. It’s made me realize that loads of people actually read comic books over here and loads of people are into martial arts.” \nMarvel’s Iron Fist premieres on Netflix on March 17. Marvel’s The Defenders premieres later in 2017. The Defenders Sunday at on Netflix", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T11:00:38.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
