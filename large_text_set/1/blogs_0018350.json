We are where we want to be – it is so positive that it allows us to dream, close enough to do a lot of good things and for nobody to think we should be champion or something.” Lucas was the Reds' surprise match winner midweek (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Read More Lucas' rare goal a timely reminder of why he is a 'special case' \nLiverpool entertain Swansea in a game Klopp knows his side must win to maintain any pressure on runaway leaders Chelsea, and that is why he believes the title run in has already started. \nNormally, the German says he tells his players the last lap in the race to be champions doesn't begin until the final six games or so, but because of the intense pressure in the race, with Chelsea on such an incredible run, he knows this is an almost unique season. \n“It has started already. I think usually the last five or six games you need to be around (the top), and then go for it,” he explained. \n“But now I know what supporters are doing because I have two sons and they are mainly supporters and they tell always 'you have to win this, because they then play against them'. Klopp has been discussing the run in (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n“Of course we have to play all the other teams at the top and when can you win, when can you lose? Actually you can lose nowhere - to stay where we are, we lost two Premier League games and that is not a lot...but we are only third! \n“There is obviously a really strong leading group in this league and that makes it exciting. If it was five games to go I'd say we need 15 points otherwise we have no chance. But there are a lot of games to go. \n“Maybe you don't win maximum points but you should not give a lot of points away to stay up there. We know about this. We know about our responsibility.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T01:00:13.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
