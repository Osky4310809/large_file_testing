Image by: Okunola Layiwola (TheOkunz). \nOlalekan Adetayo, Abuja \nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday lamented the wanton killings being witnessed in parts of the country lately, saying Nigerians have lost value for human life. \nHe has therefore directed security and law enforcement agencies to rise to the occasion and end what he called “this blight on the image of the country.” \nBuhari’s position was contained in a statement made available to journalists by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina. \n“We must condemn inhuman and unnecessary shedding of human blood all over the country. We seem to have lost value for human life, which is sacred. \n“Man is the glory of God’s creation and nobody has the right to unjustly and unlawfully take another person’s life in a reckless manner,” Buhari was quoted to have said. \nThe President also enjoined all citizens to learn to live together in peace and brotherhood and not allow little misunderstandings to degenerate into heartless acts capable of straining the bonds of nationhood. \nSpecifically, Buhari commiserated with the government and people of Benue State on the recent attack on a market in Zaki Biam by gunmen which resulted in the loss of lives. \nWhile condemning the attack, the President directed agencies to begin immediate investigation with a view to bringing the perpetrators of the dastardly act to book. \nThe President sympathised with those who lost loved ones and also prayed that God will comfort the grieving families and grant the souls of the victims eternal rest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:05:42.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
