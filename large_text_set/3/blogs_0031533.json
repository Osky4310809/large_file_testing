Filipino fisherman Rolando Omongos, 21, arrives at the Manila International Airport on March 29, 2017. Noel Celis/AFP \nMANILA, Philippines – A young fisherman flew home to the Philippines on Wednesday, March 29, after being given up for dead at sea, battling hunger, thirst and despair for nearly two months on a tiny boat that drifted all the way to Papua New Guinea. \nRolando Omongos, 21, recounted an astonishing tale of survival as he arrived from his first-ever plane ride at Manila airport, 3 weeks after his rescue by a Japanese fishing vessel. \n\"I cried non-stop when I was finally rescued. I was too weak to stand up and they had to carry me,\" the diminutive fisherman told reporters. \nHe said he survived on rainwater and moss growing at the hull of his 2.5-meter (8-foot) long boat, finding respite from the heat of the tropical sun by diving into the water frequently. \nHis 31-year-old uncle Reniel Omongos, who was on a second small boat, died after a month. The nephew believes hunger and exposure killed the older man. \nThe nephew lashed the body onto his boat for a few days but later let it sink into the water when it began to smell. \n\"God, please take care of my uncle. I have to stay alive so somebody would bring the news (to our kin),\" he said he prayed. \nThe men had set off on December 21 with other fishermen aboard a purse seiner from General Santos City. \nThe port lies more than 3,200 kilometers (nearly 2,000 miles) northwest of the PNG island of New Britain, where the rescuers later dropped the survivor off. \nA storm separated Omongos and his uncle from their mother boat on January 10, and they ran out of fuel 5 days later. \nThey later tossed their small boat engines overboard so they would float higher and avoid being swamped by huge waves. \n\"No fewer than 4 vessels would pass us by each day. I would wave at them but they would not stop for us,\" the nephew said. \nHe said the ships and fishing boats apparently failed to see their tiny vessels bobbing about 3-5 kilometers away. \n\"I never lost hope. I was always praying,\" he added. \n\"I told myself, at least one of us had to get back home.\" \nWhen the Japanese fishing vessel Wakaba Maru found him, Omongos said he was very weak and emaciated, having been reduced to eating moss once every few days. \nHe was down to just over 20 kilograms (more than 44 pounds), from his original weight of 61 kilograms. \nThe fisherman, who quit school after sixth grade, said he planned to rest after flying home to General Santos on Thursday, March 30, but vowed never to set foot on a boat again. \n\"Maybe I will go back to school instead,\" he added. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
