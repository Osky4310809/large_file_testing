They will enjoy learning and praying these simple prayers with rhyme and rhythm. Children's Morning Prayer \nLord, in the morning I start each day,By taking a moment to bow and pray.I start with thanks, and then give praiseFor all your kind and loving ways. \nToday if sunshine turns to rain,If a dark cloud brings some pain,I won't doubt or hide in fearFor you, my God, are always near. \nI will travel where you lead;I will help my friends in need.Where you send me, I will go;With your help, I'll learn and grow . \nHold my family in your hands,As we follow your commands .And I will keep you close in sightUntil I crawl in bed tonight. \nAmen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:58:13.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
