Both cars bolt, as Flores watches. \n“I was in shock because I didn’t know how did it happen or where they came from,” he says. \nHillside Police Det. Carlo Viscioni says the people who pulled off the bold carjacking are part of a much larger ring targeting suburban dealerships and stealing cars any way they can. \nThe purple Ford used in the heist was stolen in an armed carjacking just days before in Chicago, Viscioni says. \nA similar gas station car theft happened in Naperville in recent days. The cars involved in the Hillside theft have not been recovered. \nMotorists should always shut engines off and lock vehicle doors when at the gas station or running quick errands.
