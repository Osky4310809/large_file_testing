We’re fortunate in this game but unfortunately for Rain or Shine, Alex had something else on his mind,” said coach Leo Austria.

Beau Belga would muff his his potential game-clinching fadeaway as the game went to overtime. \nThen the Beermen went to the three-time PBA Most Valuable Player, who helped them gain some distance early in OT, 102-96, and even drilled a backbreaking baseline jumper with 34 seconds left for 104-101 lead. \nGabe Norwood missed a three in the ensuing possession before Marcio Lassiter blocked Jewel Ponferrada on another three point attempt as Arwind Santos sealed the deal at the charity stripe with a split. \nFajardo poured 21 of his game-high 25 points in the second half and overtime, as he also hauled down 17 rebounds. \nSantos chimed in 17 markers, 15 boards, and five assists, while RR Garcia also had 17 points off the bench. \nCabagnot and Lassiter both wound up with 14 in the win. \n“This is a total team effort for us,” said Austria, as San Miguel weathered the Rain or Shine defense which held Fajardo to a measly four points in the first half. \nBelga had 14 points and five rebounds to lead Rain or Shine (5-3), while Chris Tiu registered 13 markers. \nThe Scores: \nSAN MIGUEL 107 – Fajardo 25, Santos 17, Garcia 17, Lassiter 14, Cabagnot 14, De Ocampo 12, Ross 4, Espinas 4, Tubid 0. \nRAIN OR SHINE 101 – Belga 14, Tiu 13, Chan 11, Ponferada 9, Cruz 9, Ahanmisi 9, Maiquez 8, Washington 8, Norwood 6, Tolomia 4, Trollano 4, Yap 3, Matias 3. \nQuarters: 32-28, 56-49, 71-75, 96-96, 107-101.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T17:42:41.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
