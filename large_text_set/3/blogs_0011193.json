That’s because you hear all these terrible stories about malnourished greyhounds who lives their entire lives just to race in the hillbilly backwaters of West Virginia, Texas, Alabama, Florida, and Arkansas. Seriously — Just take one look at this infographic from a dog rescue charity Grey2k and tell me it doesn’t make you sad as hell.\nCorgi racing, however, is seems wildly amusing. This particular one is from Canterbury Park track and casino in Minnesota. It’s just little happy corgis sprinting with their little corgi legs, smiling their little corgi smiles the whole time.\nIt is happiness. It is zen. It is an instant way to turn a gloomy day into the world’s biggest smile.\nCorgi racing — better than therapy, cheaper than Prozac. Thank you for existing, you wonderful, wonderful sport.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:11:55.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
