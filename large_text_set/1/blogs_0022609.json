I'm sorry Thursday 26 January 2017 10:49 BST Click to followThe Independent Online Millions of women took to the streets on Saturday to march in protest of Donald Trump's inauguration EPA \nA post is making rounds on social media, in response to the Women’s March on Saturday, January 21, 2017. It starts with: “I am not a 'disgrace to women' because I don’t support the Women’s March. I do not feel I am a 'second class citizen' because I am a woman….” \nThis is my response to that post. Say thankyou \nSay thankyou to the women who gave you a voice. Say thankyou to the women who were arrested and imprisoned and beaten and gassed for you to have a voice. Say thankyou to the women who refused to back down, to the women who fought tirelessly to give you a voice. Say thankyou to the women who put their lives on hold, who – lucky for you – did not have “better things to do” than to march and protest and rally for your voice. So you don’t feel like a “second class citizen.” So you get to feel “equal.” \nThank Susan B Anthony and Alice Paul for your right to vote. \nThank Elizabeth Stanton for your right to work. \nThank Maud Wood Park for your prenatal care and your identity outside of your husband.

Wells, Malala Yousafzai. Thank your mother, your grandmother, your great-grandmother who did not have half of the rights you have now. \nYou can make your own choices, speak and be heard, vote, work, control your body, defend yourself, defend your family, because of the women who marched. You did nothing to earn those rights. You were born into those rights. You did nothing, but you reap the benefits of women, strong women, women who fought misogyny and pushed through patriarchy and fought for you. And you sit on your pedestal – a pedestal you are fortunate enough to have – and type. A keyboard warrior. A fighter for complacency. An acceptor of what you were given. A denier of facts. Wrapped up in your delusion of equality. \nYou are not equal. Even if you feel like you are. You still make less than a man for doing the same work. You make less as a CEO, as an athlete, as an actress, as a doctor. You make less in government, in the tech industry, in healthcare. \nYou still don’t have full rights over your own body. Men are still debating over your uterus. Over your prenatal care. Over your choices. \nYou still have to pay taxes for your basic sanitary needs. \nYou still have to carry mace when walking alone at night. You still have to prove to the court why you were drunk on the night you were raped. You still have to justify your behaviour when a man forces himself on you. Round-up: Women's March Protests 2017 \nYou still don’t have paid (or even unpaid) maternity leave. You still have to go back to work while your body is broken. While you silently suffer from postpartum depression. \nYou still have to fight to breast-feed in public. You still have to prove to other women it’s your right to do so. You still offend others with your breasts. \nYou are still objectified. You are still catcalled. You are still sexualised. You are still told you’re too skinny or you’re too fat. You’re still told you’re too old or too young. You’re applauded when you “age gracefully.” You’re still told men age “better.” You’re still told to dress “like a lady”. You are still judged on your outfit instead of what’s in your head. What brand bag you have still matters more than your college degree. \nYou are still being abused by your husband, by your boyfriend. You’re still being murdered by your partners. Being beaten by your soul mate. \nYou are still worse off if you are a woman of colour, a gay woman, a transgender woman. You are still harassed, belittled, dehumanised. \nYour daughters are still told they are beautiful before they are told they are smart. Your daughters are still told to behave even though “boys will be boys.” Your daughters are still told boys pull their hair or pinch them because they like them. \nYou are not equal. Your daughters are not equal. You are still systemically oppressed. \nEstonia allows parents to take up to three years of leave, fully paid for the first 435 days. The United States has no policy requiring maternity leave. \nSingapore’s women feel safe walking alone at night. American women do not. \nNew Zealand’s women have the smallest gender gap in wages, at 5.6per cent. The US pay gap is 20 per cent. \nIceland has the highest number of women CEOs, at 44 per cent. The United States is at 4.0 per cent. \nThe United States ranks at 45 for women’s equality. Behind Rwanda, Cuba, Philippines, Jamaica. \nBut I get it. You don’t want to admit it. You don’t want to be a victim. You think feminism is a dirty word. You think it’s not classy to fight for equality. You hate the word pussy. Unless of course you use it to call a man who isn’t up to your standard of manhood. You know the type of man that “allows” “his” woman to do whatever she damn well pleases. I get it. You believe feminists are emotional, irrational, unreasonable. Why aren’t women just satisfied with their lives, right? You get what you get and you don’t get upset, right?

You want to feel empowered. You don’t want to believe you’re oppressed. Because that would mean you are indeed a “second-class citizen.” You don’t want to feel like one. I get it. But don’t worry. I will walk for you. I will walk for your daughter. And your daughter’s daughter. And maybe you will still believe the world did not change. You will believe you’ve always had the rights you have today. And that’s okay. Because women who actually care and support other women don’t care what you think about them. They care about their future and the future of the women who come after them. \nOpen your eyes. Open them wide. Because I’m here to tell you, along with millions of other women that you are not equal. Our equality is an illusion. A feel-good sleight of hand. A trick of the mind. I’m sorry to tell you, but you are not equal. And neither are your daughters \nBut don’t worry. We will walk for you. We will fight for you. We will stand up for you. And one day you will actually be equal, instead of just feeling like you are. \nThis article originally appeared here and has been reposted with the author's permission More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T12:57:51.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
