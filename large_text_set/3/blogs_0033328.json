Ruby Cornish (@rubycornish) March 30, 2017 \nSince Wednesday night, the NSW State Emergency Service has fielded 1,400 calls, made 300 flood rescues and given more than 20,000 people immediate evacuation orders. \nOn Friday morning, Lismore’s 11-metre levee overflowed for the first time in 12 years. In Lismore, mayor Isaac Smith said he hadn’t seen as much rain for 30 to 40 years. The previous night, 220 people sheltered at an evacuation centre in the town’s Southern Cross University campus. Earlier that afternoon, a three-year-old boy was rescued after being swept away. \nSmith told AAP that at a speed of three metres a second, the floodwaters would “pick up a truck and throw it around”. Hours later, the area was declared a natural disaster zone by Berejiklian. NSW SES (@NSWSES) March 31, 2017 \nThe State Emergency Services deputy commissioner, Mark Morrow, told reporters that residents remained trapped in Murwillumbah, while Tweed Shire Council general manager Troy Green said the damage bill would reach into the millions. \nMorrow said: “[Rescuing residents] is a very technical job to do, a very complex and dangerous job. We might get a worst-case scenario there, and find people have deceased overnight as a result of being caught in floodwater.” \nIn Queensland, Logan mayor Luke Smith said they expected more than 200 homes to be swamped in the next 24 hours. Further north, in the Bowen, Whitsunday and Mackay regions, the army provided 20,000 litres of drinking water to cyclone-hit Airlie Beach, which has been without power since Tuesday morning. Emergency generators were also brought in to run essential services such as hospitals. ABC News Brisbane (@ABCNewsBrisbane) March 30, 2017 \nQueensland’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said 2,000 damage assessments had been completed in the northern strike zone of ex-cyclone Debbie, with 270 properties already damaged so severely by the category-four storm that they were uninhabitable. \nMore than 90,000 homes were said to be without powe r in the state’s south-east, with 50,000 more in the north. \nQueensland’s sugar industry has estimated $150m of damage has been dealt to sugar cane growers in the Proserpine and Mackay regions. \nBruce Gunn, the Bureau of Meteorology’s regional director, said Rockhampton on Queensland’s mid-coast was at risk of flooding next week, due to rainfall in the catchment area of the Fitzroy river. Lismore floods as authorities warn worst is yet to come \nIn the mountainous Upper Springbrook region, south of the Gold Coast, 789mm of rain was recorded overnight. \nOn Friday evening, major flood warnings remained active for the Tweed, Wilsons and Richmond rivers. On the Darling Downs, the local council is reporting that raw sewage has begun to leak into floodwaters. In Nimbin, residents have also been told to boil their water. \nIn Airlie Beach, pharmacy manager Karen Milostic told AAP she had seen her twice-flood-damaged store destroyed again, only six months after it re-opened following extensive renovations. “This is going to take months,” she said. “But you’ve got to get on with it.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T09:41:28.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
