It’s important to remember exactly when Jeff Sessions’s meeting with the Russian ambassador occurred. The meeting took place on Sept. 8, weeks after Russia’s intervention in the presidential campaign had become a huge story. This timeline makes Sessions’s defense — that it was a garden-variety, unmemorable meeting — a little hard to accept. Even if nothing untoward happened during the meeting, Sessions had to have understood how sensitive it was for a top adviser to the Trump campaign to meet with the Russian ambassador. Yet in January he chose to testify, under oath, that he “did not have communications with the Russians” during the campaign. Now he claims to be the victim of a simple misunderstanding — that his meeting with the ambassador was part of his job as a senator, not a campaign surrogate.
