The show’s lead pair of Dipika Singh and Anas Rashid were quite popular with the audience, and the show’s sequel will take forward the story of their daughter, Kanak. \nTitled Tu Sooraj, Main Saanjh Piyaji, it stars Rhea Sharma and Avinash Rekhi in lead roles, and will air April 3 onwards. The show will take a leap of 20 years and focus on the life of Rathi family, after the death of Sooraj and Sandhya.
