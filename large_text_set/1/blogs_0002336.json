Nixon Did It. \nDon't sweep it under the rug. Getty Washington Bureau By Charles P. Pierce Jan 3, 2017 Is it too late to dig up Richard Nixon and set his mouldering corpse on fire on the National Mall, preferably in front of that portion of the Vietnam Memorial in which are carved the names of every American who died there between the years 1969 and 1972? My buddy Jack Farrell has a new Nixon biography coming out and, over the weekend, in The New York Times , he provided the final evidence in support of a flaming national catharsis. \nA newfound cache of notes left by H. R. Haldeman, his closest aide, shows that Nixon directed his campaign's efforts to scuttle the peace talks, which he feared could give his opponent, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, an edge in the 1968 election. On Oct. 22, 1968 , he ordered Haldeman to \"monkey wrench\" the initiative… Haldeman's notes return us to the dark side. Amid the reappraisals, we must now weigh apparently criminal behavior that, given the human lives at stake and the decade of carnage that followed in Southeast Asia, may be more reprehensible than anything Nixon did in Watergate.   What an evil fck. What an unimaginably evil fck the man was. \n\"! Keep Anna Chennault working on\" South Vietnam, Haldeman scrawled, recording Nixon's orders. \"Any other way to monkey wrench it? Anything RN can do.\" Nixon told Haldeman to have Rose Mary Woods, the candidate's personal secretary, contact another nationalist Chinese figure — the businessman Louis Kung — and have him press Thieu as well. \"Tell him hold firm,\" Nixon said. Most Popular Go ahead. Tell me again about the opening to China, and the EPA, and all the rest of it. This is pure treason, worse than anything Aaron Burr ever tried, beyond anything for which Nixon pursued bureaucrats during his Red-hunting days. \nIn a conversation with the Republican senator Everett Dirksen, the minority leader, Johnson lashed out at Nixon. \"I'm reading their hand, Everett,\" Johnson told his old friend. \"This is treason.\" \"I know,\" Dirksen said mournfully. If the Vietnamese want to set the pile of decomposing sins on fire in downtown Hanoi, I won't object to that, either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T22:35:27.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
