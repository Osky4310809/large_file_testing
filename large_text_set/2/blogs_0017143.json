He excelled at anything that he put his mind to - medicine, poetry, sketching, architecture, sociology... the list seems nearly endless. \nThus, Rizal's martyrdom by the Spanish colonial authorities, while he was still quite young, was a huge loss to â€‹ the Philippines , and to the world at large. \nToday, the people of the Philippines honor him as their national hero. Early Life: \nOn June 19, 1861, Francisco Rizal Mercado and Teodora Alonzo y Quintos welcomed their seventh child into the world at Calamba, Laguna. They named the boy Jose Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda. \nThe Mercado family were wealthy farmers who rented land from the Dominican religious order. Descendants of a Chinese immigrant named Domingo Lam-co, they changed their name to Mercado (\"market\") under the pressure of anti-Chinese feeling amongst the Spanish colonizers. \nFrom an early age, Jose Rizal Mercado showed a precocious intellect. \ncontinue reading below our video Profile of Jose Rizal He learned the alphabet from his mother at 3, and could read and write at age 5. Education: \nJose Rizal Mercado attended the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, graduating at the age of 16 with highest honors. He took a post-graduate course there in land surveying. \nRizal Mercado completed his surveyor's training in 1877, and passed the licensing exam in May 1878, but could not receive a license to practice because he was only 17 years old. (He was granted a license in 1881, when he reached the age of majority.) \nIn 1878, the young man also enrolled in the University of Santo Tomas as a medical student. He later quit the school, alleging discrimination against Filipino students by the Dominican professors. Rizal Goes to Madrid: \nIn May of 1882, Jose Rizal got on a ship to Spain without informing his parents of his intentions. He enrolled at the Universidad Central de Madrid. \nIn June of 1884, he received his medical degree at the age of 23; the following year, he also graduated from the Philosophy and Letters department. \nInspired by his mother's advancing blindness, Rizal next went to the University of Paris and then the University of Heidelberg to complete further study in the field of ophthalmology. At Heidelberg, he studied under the famed professor Otto Becker. Rizal finished his second doctorate at Heidelberg in 1887. Rizal's Life in Europe: \nJose Rizal lived in Europe for 10 years. During that time, he picked up a number of languages; in fact, he could converse in more than 10 different tongues. \nWhile in Europe, the young Filipino impressed everyone who met him with his charm, his intelligence, and his mastery of an incredible range of different fields of study. \nRizal excelled at martial arts, fencing, sculpture, painting, teaching, anthropology, and journalism, among other things. \nDuring his European sojourn, he also began to write novels. Rizal finished his first book, Noli Me Tangere , while living in Wilhemsfeld with the Reverend Karl Ullmer. Novels and Other Works: \nRizal wrote Noli Me Tangere in Spanish; it was published in 1887 in Berlin. The novel is a scathing indictment of the Catholic Church and Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. \nThis book cemented Jose Rizal on the Spanish colonial government's list of troublemakers. When Rizal returned home for a visit, he received a summons from the Governor General, and had to defend himself from charges of disseminating subversive ideas. \nAlthough the Spanish governor accepted Rizal's explanations, the Catholic Church was less willing to forgive. In 1891, Rizal published a sequel, titled El Filibusterismo . Program of Reforms: \nBoth in his novels and in newspaper editorials, Jose Rizal called for a number of reforms of the Spanish colonial system in the Philippines. \nHe advocated freedom of speech and assembly, equal rights before the law for Filipinos, and Filipino priests in place of the often-corrupt Spanish churchmen. In addition, Rizal called for the Philippines to become a province of Spain, with representation in the Spanish legislature (the Cortes Generales ). \nRizal never called for independence for the Philippines. Nonetheless, the colonial government considered him a dangerous radical, and declared him an enemy of the state. Exile and Courtship: \nIn 1892, Rizal returned to the Philippines. He was almost immediately accused of being involved in the brewing rebellion and was exiled to Dapitan , on the island of Mindanao. Rizal would stay there for four years, teaching school and encouraging agricultural reforms. \nDuring that same period, the people of the Philippines grew more eager to revolt against the Spanish colonial presence. Inspired in part by Rizal's organization, La Liga , rebel leaders like Andres Bonifacio began to press for military action against the Spanish regime. \nIn Dapitan, Rizal met and fell in love with Josephine Bracken, who brought her stepfather to him for a cataract operation. The couple applied for a marriage license, but were denied by the Church (which had excommunicated Rizal). Trial and Execution: \nThe Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896. Rizal denounced the violence and received permission to travel to Cuba in order to tend victims of yellow fever in exchange for his freedom. Bonifacio and two associates sneaked aboard the ship to Cuba before it left the Philippines, trying to convince Rizal to escape with them, but Rizal refused. \nHe was arrested by the Spanish on the way, taken to Barcelona, and then extradited to Manila for trial. Jose Rizal was tried by court martial, charged with conspiracy, sedition, and rebellion. \nDespite a lack of any evidence of his complicity in the Revolution, Rizal was convicted on all counts and given the death sentence. \nHe was allowed to marry Josephine two hours before his execution by firing squad on December 30, 1896. Jose Rizal was just 35 years old. Jose Rizal's Legacy: \nJose Rizal is remembered today throughout the Philippines for his brilliance, his courage, his peaceful resistance to tyranny, and his compassion. Filipino school children study his final literary work, a poem called Mi Ultimo Adios (\"My Last Goodbye\"), as well as his two famous novels. \nSpurred on by Rizal's martyrdom, the Philippine Revolution continued until 1898. With assistance from the United States, the Philippine archipelago was able to defeat the Spanish army. The Philippines declared its independence from Spain on June 12, 1898. It was the first democratic republic in Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:39:43.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
