He expertly spits verses and often produces his own tracks, sometimes calling on Aussie producers like Miracle & DOPAM!NE to lay beats down for him – like right here on “Assumption.” Counting Apple Beats 1’s Zane Lowe as a fan – the audio for the track premiered on his show a few months back – and recently opening for American rappers like Danny Brown and Denzel Curry on his home turf in Sydney, it’s clear this is only the beginning of the first chapter of Manu Crooks.\nManu Crooks himself gave us the full lowdown on the visuals for “Assumption” – “We decided to go for a moody/vibrant vibe. Feels like a great transition from the “Blowin Up” video and although there’s no real story line, the video serves as an unexpected twist to the song. If you heard the song first, you’d probably expect it to be the typical ‘turn up/part’ video but that’s something we didn’t wanna do. Myself and the director Julian Machuca delivered something engaging, fun and unexpected.”\nCheck out our exclusive premiere of “Assumption” below.\n\nRead what we had to say about Manu in our round-up of Australian hip-hop acts to watch right here . \nFor more of our premieres, check out this hilarious video from Atlanta rapper Nebu Kiniza right here . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:53:59.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
