Rick Nolan today released the following statement regarding the postponement of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) proposed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress: “ This travesty of a measure advanced by President Trump and Republicans in Congress would have taken away health insurance from 24 million people in order to provide a $600 billion dollar tax cut to millionaires and billionaires. There was nothing in this bill to like, the American people did not support it, the damage it stood to cause was irreparable, and that's why Republicans in Congress couldn't even rally their own party around it.” “With its $880 billion in Medicaid cuts, this bill targeted the poor, the elderly, the sick, the disabled, rural hospitals and rural communities. This bill hit seniors the hardest with premiums up to five times more costly. And by removing comprehensive requirements for essential services like Preventative Care, Emergency Room Care, Hospitalization, Prescriptions, Maternity Care, Newborn Care, Mental Health Care and Chronic Disease Management, this bill targeted pretty much everyone. And regardless of the fact that millions of jobs will be lost all across the health care industry as a result of their actions.” “Now it’s time for President Trump to make good on his promise to cover every single American with good, affordable, accessible health care. And it’s time for Republicans and Democrats to put politics aside, start over, fix what needs fixing in the Affordable Care Act, and get health care reform right for the American people. We need to get busy tacking the battle of rising healthcare costs – not dismantling our whole system.” Issues:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T08:34:11.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
