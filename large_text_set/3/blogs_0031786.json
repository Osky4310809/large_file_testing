Now, the brand is back with yet another such offering called the Aqua Prime 4G. Similar to the Aqua 4G Mini, the Aqua Prime 4G is also a budget device with 4G and VoLTE support, and can be used with Jio SIM cards to make high-definition calling. \nThe Intex Aqua Prime 4G features a 5.5-inch HD On-Cell display with screen-to-body ratio of 70 percent. The processor ticking under the hood is a quad-core MediaTek MT6735P that sports a clock speed of 1GHz. The phone comes with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal memory, which can be further increased up to 32GB by inserting a microSD card. \nThe Aqua Prime 4G features an 8-megapixel autofocus primary shooter with a dual-LED flash, an aperture of f/2.2 and HDR. For selfies and video calling, the phone gets a 2-megapixel fixed-focus front-facing snapper with a single-LED flash. Apart from 4G and VoLTE, its other connectivity options include dual-SIM slots, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS. A 2,800mAh battery keeps the phone running. \nThe Intex Aqua Prime 4G features a textured back, and is available in three hues including white, grey and champagne. The phone has been listed on the brand’s website for Rs 6,555, and is expected to go on sale soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T14:05:00.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
