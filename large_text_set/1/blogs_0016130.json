Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows #2 Back when the announcement came that Sony and Marvel Studios would reboot the Spider-Man franchise, many hoped Miles Morales, and not Peter Parker, would be the film’s titular hero. Shortly after it was announced that Peter Parker would, in fact, be Spider-Man in the live-action Sony and Marvel Studios films, rumors began to circulate that Miles Morales would be the star of an animated movie by Sony. Today, those rumors became a reality.\nThis news comes to us from a recent Sony animation presentation. The Bob Persichetti/Peter Ramsey-directed and Phil Lord/Chris Miller-executive animated feature is set to hit theaters over the Christmas weekend of 2018. The presentation had a 30-second sizzle reel that gave a small taste of what to expect. Unfortunately, we don’t have that footage for you all here, but according to Forbes , the film has an art style that “resembled a cross between an Alex Ross image and a psychedelic cover image.”\nFor those who don’t know, Miles Morales first made his debut within Marvel Comics’ Ultimate line. Miles gained his spider-like abilities in a manner very reminiscent to how Peter Parker got his powers. After Parker had been killed, Morales took it upon himself to become the new Spider-Man and honor his fallen mentor. After the Ultimate Universe was rolled over into the mainstream Marvel Universe, Miles became one of that world’s various Spider-Men and even joined the Avengers. Unlike Parker who has taken his superheroics around the world, Miles remains a New York-based crime fighter (for the most part).\nHaving Peter Parker in the live action movies and Miles Morales in the animated film is a great way for Sony and Marvel to please fans of both characters. With any luck, Miles will eventually make his way over to the live-action movies — especially if this animated film is a hit. We’ll hopefully see some footage from this movie sometime soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:37:41.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
