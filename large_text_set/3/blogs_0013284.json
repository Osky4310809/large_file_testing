The roadmap mentioned when this much-awaited update will be released for the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge . It also revealed that we should expect the Galaxy Note 5 to receive Nougat by mid-March. \nWeâ€™re now receiving reports that the Galaxy Note 5 Android 7.0 Nougat update is being rolled out in Turkey today. Samsung is rolling out firmware version N920CXXU3CQC7 in the country. The update weighs just under 1.3GB which makes sense considering its a major update. \nIt may take a while for the update to go live across all regions of the country but at least Galaxy Note 5 owners in Turkey can rest assured that they will soon be running the latest and greatest iteration of Android. The firmware file is also available from our firmware section . \nThis goes to show that Samsung will soon start rolling out the Galaxy Note 5 Android 7.0 Nougat updates in other markets as well in the near future. We should expect the update to go live in additional markets across the globe in the coming weeks. \nThanks, Enis!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:51:09.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
