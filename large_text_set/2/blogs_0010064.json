This is said to be a fresh deal between the two companies after Samsung Display inked another contract with Apple last year for supplying 100 million OLED display panels for the iPhone 8. Apple is expected to make the switch to OLED displays with the iPhone 8 for the very first time. \nApple ships close to 200 million iPhones every year so the combined supply volume of 160 million OLED panel units means that Samsung is going to fill almost 80 percent of Apple’s entire demand. Previous reports have suggested that only the premium model of the iPhone is going to feature an OLED display this year but as reports of an increase in panel supply keep coming in, it’s now expected that the two to three iPhone variants that Apple is expected to launch this year may all feature an OLED display. \nNeither company has confirmed or denied this deal, as is the norm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:35:46.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
