husband set to be deported \nRoberto Beristain's family says he has a work permit and a social security card, while his restaurant provides income for 20 families Friday 24 March 2017 18:11 GMT Click to followThe Independent US Roberto Beristain, third from right, was due to be deported on Friday Phil Kolliopoulos/change.org \nA woman who voted for Donald Trump because of his immigration policies is now facing the prospect of having her husband deported to Mexico. \nHelen Beristain said she cast her ballot for the president, beleiving that only \"killers\" and cartel members would be deported. \n\"We don’t want to have cartels here, you don’t want to have drugs in your high schools, you don’t want killers next to you,” she told Indiana Public Media . “You want to feel safe when you leave your house. I truly believe that. And, this is why I voted for Mr. Trump.\" \nBut her 43-year-old husband Roberto, is now facing deportation after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials ruled he should be forcibly removed from the US. Read more Donald Trump appears to lie about lying in Time interview \nMr Beristain arr ived in the U S in 1998 and illegally stayed on, despite a deportation order handed down in 2000. \nDuring a trip to Niagara Falls in 2000 with his wife, Helen, and stepson, Phil Kolliopoulos, Beristain was arrested when the family inadvertently took a wrong turn and arrived at the Canadian border, his stepson Phil Kolliopoulos wrote on a petition, calling for him to stay. \nAfter hiring a lawyer and posting $1,500 (£1,200) in bail, Mr Beristain was released on a voluntary self-deportation order, giving him 60 days to leave the country. \nFearing for his pregnant wife, he chose to stay, Mr Kolliopoulos said, adding that he went on too obtain a driver's licence, social security card, and work permit. \nThe couple went on to have three children, who he supported by running steak restaurant near their home in Granger, Indiana. \nMr Beristain was also making a regular check-in visit with ICE officials, who had allowed him to stay, until they changed their minds last month and detained him. \nHis detention came amid a crackdown on illegal immigration ordered by President Donald Trump early in his tenure. \nHe promised to deport \"probably two million, even three million\" people within two years and during his campaign infamously said Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists and some, I assume, are good people\". \nMs Beristain's wife Helen said Mr Trump \"did say the good people would not be deported, the good people would be checked.\" \nMr Kolliopoulos described him as a \"supportive and loving husband and father\", and \"very dedicated\" to his restaurant which Mr Kolliopoulos said provided income to 20 families. \nHe added: \"Roberto is the cook, buser, server, bartender and host, filling in wherever possible at his restaurant. He is hard-working, genuine and the most trustworthy person.\" \nThe Independent has contacted ICE for comment by phone and email. \nMs Beristain as filed paperwork to establish a legal basis for her husband to remain in the US, according to the petition. Trump pretends to drive a truck as healthcare bill struggles to pass \nMr Beristain's is not the first case of its kind. \nLast month a southern Illinois community that solidly backed Mr Trump in the election rallied behind a Mexican restaurant manager who did not have permission to live in the US, and had been detained by ICE. \nMany in West Frankfort, population 8,000, did not know Juan Carlos Hernandez Pacheco was living there illegally until his arrest. \nOne said: \"I think people need to do things the right way, follow the rules and obey the laws. \n\"But in the case of Carlos, I think he may have done more for the people here than this place has ever given him. I think it's absolutely terrible that he could be taken away.\" \nAlso in February, Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer lashed out at what he called Mr Trump's \"mass deportation plan\" and said it \"must be stopped\". \n\"We can all agree that violent criminals should be removed, but it is outrageous and unacceptable for ICE to target or arrest innocent immigrant families contributing to our nation and working to achieve the American Dream,\" he said.
