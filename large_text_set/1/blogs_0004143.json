While they are quite pricey, the fēnix 3 line has proven to be one of the most powerful multisport watches on the market.\nToday at CES 2017 , Garmin has unveiled three new entries to its fēnix lineup, the fēnix 5, fēnix 5S and fēnix 5X.\nAs the names might suggest, all three of these new devices are in the same family, so they all sport most of the same features. There are a few big differentiators between the three, though. The fēnix 5S, for instance, is a lighter, sleeker and smaller version of the standard fēnix 5. The fēnix 5 is the standard model, sporting all the same features as the 5S in a bigger form factor. The 5X is the highest-end device in the bunch, complete with preloaded wrist-based mapping.\nGarmin's new QuickFit bands will make switching between leather, metal and sport bands a breeze\nIf you’ve ever tried switching out the strap on a traditional watch, you’d know it can be quite a hassle. With Garmin’s new QuickFit bands, though, users will easily be able to switch between leather, metal and sporty bands without tools.\nSee also: The best fitness trackers 3 weeks ago Here are a few other differences you need to know:\nfenix 5 The fēnix 5 is the standard model of the group. Measuring 47mm, it’s more compact than previous models like the fēnix 3HR, but still packs all the multisport features you’d come to expect from the series.\nfenix 5S Garmin says the fēnix 5S is the first watch in the line designed specifically for female adventurers. Measuring just 42mm, the 5S is small and comfortable for petite wrists, without compromising any multisport features. It’s available in silver with either a white, turquoise or black silicone band color options with a mineral glass lens.\nThere’s also a fēnix 5S Sapphire model with a scratch-resistant sapphire lens that’s available in black with a black band, champagne with a water-resistant gray suede band, or champagne with a metal band. This model also comes with an extra silicone QuickFit band.\nfenix 5X The higher-end fēnix 5X measures 51mm and comes preloaded with TOPO US mapping, routable cycling maps and other navigation features like Round Trip Run and Round Trip Ride. With these new features, users can enter how far they’d like to run or ride, and their watch will suggest appropriate courses to choose from. The 5X will also display easy-to-read guidance cues for upcoming turns, allowing users to be aware of their route.\nIn addition, the 5X can use Around Me map mode to see different points of interest and other map objects within the user’s range to help users be more aware of their surroundings. This model will be available with a scratch-resistant sapphire lens.\n\nAll three fēnix 5 devices come preloaded with full multisport functionality for running, hiking, swimming, biking and more. They all feature Garmin’s impressive Elevate heart rate trackers, water resistance up to 100 meters, as well as built-in navigation features with a 3-axis compass, gyroscope and barometric altimeter, and, of course, a GPS.\nThey all also feature a variety of connected features that make these devices true smartwatches. Users can get call, text and email smartphone notifications. All Sapphire models are also Wi-Fi enabled, so users will be able to connect with their home network and upload statistics even if their smartphones aren’t around.\nAll three watches are coming to market in Q1 2017\nAll three watches are coming to market sometime in Q1 2017, though we don’t have exact launch details at this time. The fēnix 5 and 5S will launch with a suggested retail price of $599.99, while the fēnix 5 Sapphire, 5S Sapphire and 5X Sapphire will have a suggested retail price of $699.99.
