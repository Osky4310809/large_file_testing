Everything you need to know about Lionel Messi's girlfriend & future wife Getty Images 0 24-Mar-2017 04:13:03 The Barcelona star is rumoured to be planning a spectacular wedding this summer with his long-term partner from his hometown of Rosario \nLionel Messi left his hometown of Rosario as a child in order to join Barcelona, but his links to the city remain strong. \nNone is stronger than his long-term relationship with Antonella Roccuzzo, who he grew up with in Argentina and now shares two children with. Messi first confirmed he had a girlfriend back in 2009 and she has since moved out to join him in Spain. \nBut who is Antonella and how did she get to know the five-time Ballon d'Or winner? This is what we know about Messi's main confidante. WHO IS ANTONELLA ROCCUZZO? \nRoccuzzo was born in Rosario, like Messi, and is the cousin of the Barcelona star's childhood friend Lucas Scaglia. \nMessi has a reputation for shyness - particularly as a youngster - but is said to have been besotted with Antonella from a young age, regularly visiting Scaglia's family home just to get a chance to see her. A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) on May 1, 2016 at 7:46am PDT \nShe attended university in Argentina - studying odotology before switching to social communication - and then moved to Barcelona to join Leo. It's not clear if she has chosen a particular career since coming out to Spain or focused on raising their two sons, Thiago and Mateo. \nAccording to Infobae , the relationship blossomed after Messi returned to Rosario to console Antonella following the death of her friend in a traffic accident. That is said to have been sometime back in 2007, but their association was kept private for years. A post shared by Sofi (@sofibalbi) on Jul 29, 2016 at 2:41pm PDT \nGenerally speaking, Antonella has continued to stay out of the spotlight - and though she amassed 3.7 million followers on Instagram, she has since switched her account to private. \nThe 29-year-old is known to be friends with Luis Suarez's wife Sofia Balbi and Cesc Fabregas' partner Daniella Semaan. HOW MANY CHILDREN DOES MESSI HAVE? A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) on Dec 31, 2016 at 3:37pm PST \nLeo and Antonella have two sons; Thiago, born on November 2, 2012 and is now four, and Mateo, who was born on September 11, 2015 and is one. \nMessi has tributes to both of his children tattooed on his body and also sports both of their names on his boots. Clearly a proud father, he also regularly shares pictures of the family on his Instagram account. WILL MESSI & ANTONELLA GET MARRIED? \nHaving been together for at least eight or nine years now and with two children, it would appear Messi and Roccuzzo are in it together for the long haul. \nThey are yet to tie the knot, however, leading to plenty of speculation over the past few years over when they might choose to take the next step. A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) on Sep 17, 2016 at 10:08am PDT \nThe latest reports out of Catalonia have claimed that a date has been set this summer, with Leo and Antonella planning to get married on Messi's birthday, June 24, at the Rosario Cathedral.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:28:43.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
