Near the commercial’s end, he says, “A young boy from Harlem, I couldn’t even be a waiter. They didn’t want me to be a waiter, so you know what I did? I became a billionaire.” \nThe internet took that as a huge win for Hip Hop as Diddy received a much praise and news coverage. According to a post from his Instagram account, he simply misspoke and isn’t a billionaire yet. \n“A lot of blogs took that as I had become Hip Hop’s first billionaire,” said Diddy. “That is not the case. The race is still on. It’s up for grabs. Any of you hustlers out there come out and get it.” \nAccording to reports, the culture’s first person to reach ten figures could ride between Diddy, Jay Z and Dr. Dre, who was rumored to reach the status first after selling his Beats by Dre line for $3 billion. With a reported net worth of around $750 million, Diddy was also on the 2016 Forbes Hip Hop list at number 1.
