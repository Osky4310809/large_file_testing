the Capitol about President Donald Trump ’s immigration executive orders boiled over Thursday, as several members of the Hispanic Caucus were kicked out of a meeting with a top immigration official by staffers of Speaker Paul Ryan . \nThose who were allowed in described a combative encounter with promises of many more arrests and deportations to come. \n“There’s never been a meeting like this,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. “I’ve never seen anything like it.” \nThe hour-long meeting with acting Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan covered a range of concerns about recent arrests and deportations around the country, though members said they left the meeting with many questions unanswered. \nTen Democrats were allowed into the meeting, including Pelosi, but members who were removed from the meeting were left fuming outside the closed doors. \n“I’m really shocked, bewildered, that the Speaker of the House would act as a gatekeeper for the president of the United States and deny fellow members of the House the ability to attend meetings that they called for,” said Rep. Luis Gutierrez , D-Ill. “I know that there’s a dictatorial spirit at the White House. Apparently it’s infected the speaker’s office here in the Capitol, and I think it’s really, really sad.” \nThe Trump administration — either the White House or Homeland Security Sec. John Kelly — was given authority over which Democrats would be able to attend the meeting, said Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham , D-N.M. \nHoman told the members that 683 people have been rounded up in five primary target cities and deported since Trump signed his executive order, including in Austin and San Antonio, attendees said. \nRep. Linda Sanchez , a California Democrat and the former chairwoman of the caucus, said they were told they “can and should expect more arrests and removals this year.” The only factor constraining ICE from mass deportations on an unprecedented scale, she said, was that they do not have enough resources to do so. \nIf not for that, all 11 million undocumented immigrants could be subject to deportation, Lujan Grisham said. \nRep. Joaquin Castro , a San Antonio Democrat and the vice-chairman of the caucus, was also allowed into the meeting and came away saying it was clear that “the Trump administration is going to target as many people as possible.” \n“The only hesitation they seemed to have was whether they would go after DACA recipients,” Castro said, referring to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama administration program allowing children of unauthorized immigrants who were brought here as minors to remain in the U.S. 1. After attending the ICE meeting it's hard not to conclude that President Trump has started his mass deportation plan. — Joaquin Castro (@JoaquinCastrotx) February 16, 2017 \nOn Tuesday, Homan cancelled a meeting with the Hispanic Caucus at the last minute, explaining that too many attendees had signed up and the Trump administration would allow the meeting only if it were bipartisan. As a result, ICE worked with Ryan’s office to schedule a smaller meeting with a select group of members from both parties. \nAshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, said the meeting was limited at the request of the Department of Homeland Security to members with “jurisdictional interests in immigration enforcement.” Because the Hispanic Caucus wanted to be involved with the meeting — which it had initially called for — Strong said Lujan Grisham was allowed to come on behalf of the caucus. \n“We are confident that the [caucus] chair is capable of representing the views of her caucus, and this arrangement was made very clear to the [caucus] ahead of time,” Strong said in a written statement. \nInitially no Hispanic Caucus members were going to be allowed at the meeting at all, Pelosi said, “until we explained to them that that was not going to qualify as a meeting.” \nIn addition to Castro, two other Texans were at the meeting: Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul , R-Austin, and Rep. John Carter , R-Houston, who serves as chairman of the homeland security appropriations subcommittee. \nJavier Gamboa, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, called it “wildly insulting” that Ryan’s staff would remove Hispanic members from a “critical meeting that greatly concerns their community.” \n“What’s even more shocking is that the Speaker delivered this insult to his colleagues apparently at President Trump's command,” he said.
