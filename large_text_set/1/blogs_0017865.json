O’Reilly has thrown shade at Will over his decision to go #NeverTrump and leave the Republican Party during the 2016 election, and he has continued to throw barbs at Will in the months since then. \nMs. Dash is a conservative commentator who became famous for her acting in the 90’s comedy Clueless . Dash would occasionally give her unvarnished thoughts on Outnumbered , which drove conversation at times, while sparking controversy at others. \nRollins frequently appeared on Fox to discuss Republican strategy, based on his experience advising and directing the Reagan-Bush campaign of 1984. He currently works as the chairman of the pro- President Trump Great America PAC. \nAlso let go were Marvin Kalb and Cal Thomas. These departures come shortly after British politician and Brexit proponent Nigel Farage was signed on as a contributor . \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T05:43:48.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
