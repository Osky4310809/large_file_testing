These missions will build upon that heritage, extending it to deep space mission operations, an important milestone as we work towards our ultimate goal of transporting humans to Mars.\" (See also: How SpaceX Reinvented the Rocket Launch Industry ) \nSpaceX said that the two passengers had already paid a \"significant deposit\" to be on the spacecraft. CEO Elon Musk said in a press conference that they approached him, and are not from Hollywood. \nThe passengers will begin fitness training later this year. Powered by SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, the spacecraft is expected to launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Both the rocket and the spacecraft are scheduled to undergo testing this year. Musk told the press that both passengers “are entering this with their eyes open, knowing that there is some risk here.” (See also: SpaceX Wants to Launch a Massive Satellite Internet Network ) \nThe company plans to conduct more such private missions and Musk expects them to be a \"significant driver of revenue.\" SpaceX thanked NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, which provided most of the funding for Dragon 2 development. NASA released a statement in response saying, “NASA commends its industry partners for reaching higher. For more than a decade, NASA has invested in private industry to develop capabilities for the American people and seed commercial innovation to advance humanity's future in space.\" NASA is studying the possibility of conducting a similar mission next year after being asked by the Trump administration to do so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T11:11:30.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
