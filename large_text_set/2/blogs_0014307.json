Compared to successful launch by the Russian Space Agency launching 37 satellites in one go, India will become the first country to script history if it succeeds in launching 104 satellites in a single rocket. \nIt will also be ISRO's second successful attempt after launching 23 satellites in one go in June 2015. \nPSLV will first launch the 714 kg CARTOSAT-2 Series satellite for earth observation and then inject 103 co-passenger satellites, together weighing about 664 kg at lift-off into polar Sun Synchronous Orbit, about 520 km from Earth. \nISRO scientists have used the XL Variant -- the most powerful rocket --earlier used in the ambitious Chandrayaan and during the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM). \nOf 101 co-passenger satellites, 96 belongto USA, five from International customers of ISRO -- Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, respectively. \nTwo other Indian nano satellites, totally weighing about 1,378 kg, will also ride piggyback in the rocket \nThe nano-satellites belonging to international customers are being launched as part of the arrangement by Antrix Corporation Ltd (ANTRIX) the commercial arm of the ISRO. \nCartosat-2 Series, which is the primary satellite, will be similar to the earlier four satellites in Cartosat-2 Series. \nAfter coming into operation, it will provide remote sensing services.Images sent by it will be useful for coastal land use and regulation, road network monitoring, distribution of water and creation of land use maps, among others. \nCartosat-2 Series has a mission life of five years. \nThe two Indian Nano-satellites INS-1A and INS-1B were developed as co-passenger satellites to accompany bigger satellites on PSLV. \nThe primary objective of INS (ISRO Nano Satellite) is to provide an opportunity for ISRO technology demonstration payloads, provide a standard bus for launch on demand services. \nINS-1A carries Surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function Radiometer and INS-1B caries Earth Exosphere Lyman Alpha Analyser as payloads. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:53:03.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
