Her ability to turn into a beetle also reflected how irritating and bothersome she was to other people, particularly Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore , and it also displayed her dishonest characteristics. Rita also wrote primarily for the Daily Prophet , though some of her articles have also appeared in other sources, such as Witch Weekly and The Quibbler . Skeeter worked closely alongside Bozo , her photographer. [1] A younger Rita Skeeter as a court reporter at the trial of Igor Karkaroff \nSkeeter was a journalist at the time of the First Wizarding War when Lord Voldemort was in power. In 1981, at the fall of Voldemort and end of the War, Skeeter reported on the Death Eater trials before the Council of Magical Law , of people such as Igor Karkaroff and Ludovic Bagman . [7] She expressed visible shock when Karkaroff seemingly named the Council leader, Bartemius Crouch , as the torturer of Aurors Frank and Alice Longbottom ; Karkaroff paused before finishing with the word 'Junior', indicating Crouch's son. [8] Triwizard Tournament Edit \" Hello, I'm Rita Skeeter! I write for the Daily Prophet . But, of course, you know that, don't you? It's you we don't know. You're the juicy news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? What mysteries do the muscles mask? Does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick? Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my ravid readers. \" —Rita Skeeter, introducing herself to the champions competing in the Triwizard Tournament [src] Rita interviewing Harry Potter \nThat year, Rita was given the opportunity to interview the Triwizard Tournament contestants for an article in the Daily Prophet . Under the guise of interviewing all four champions, she confronted Harry Potter in a broom cupboard where she took his \"um\"s and \"er\"s and invented her own quotes. Eventually, her \"interview of the contestants\" turned out to be a highly falsified story of Harry himself. \nThe article painted Harry as a tragic hero who cried himself to sleep over his late parents and who had a romantic relationship with Hermione Granger . The article was mostly taken negatively by Harry's schoolmates, who assumed he was craving attention, although Molly Weasley seemed to take it very seriously, to the point that she was particularly cool towards Hermione for a time until Harry assured her that the article was lying and he and Hermione had never dated. At some point after the first task, Albus Dumbledore had banned Rita from entering Hogwarts Castle. Rita watching a Care of Magical Creatures lesson focused on Blast-Ended Skrewts \nRita then interviewed Rubeus Hagrid , asking many questions about Harry that Hagrid refused to answer. Her subsequent article described Hagrid as a ferocious-looking man who used his authority to terrify his students, but was otherwise mostly true. The article also revealed to the world that Hagrid was actually half-giant , which prompted letters from parents frightened by the idea of having a dangerous giant teaching their children and greatly upset Hagrid, subjecting him to ridicule and fear, although his mood was rallied when Harry, Ron , Hermione, and Dumbledore visited him and assured him that they didn't care about his family being the vicious monsters everyone believed them to be. Giants really were vicious and brutal, but Hagrid obviously wasn't, so Professor Dumbledore insisted Hagrid deny any insults and return to work, as Harry and his friends didn't care about Hagrid's family due to their knowledge of him as a person. \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione overheard her discussing the possibility of writing an embarrassing story about Ludo Bagman, head of Magical Games and Sports. HARRY POTTER'S SECRET HEARTACHE , an article published in Witch Weekly by Rita \nWhen Rita encountered Harry, Ron, and Hermione in Hogsmeade , Hermione insulted her for her libel. Rita, in retaliation, then wrote a nasty story about the \" devious Miss Granger \" based on false rumours provided by Pansy Parkinson , making her out to be a plain but skilled witch who used Love Potions to \" satisfy her taste for celebrity wizards ,\" including toying with the affections of both Harry and Krum. Although Hermione was more disdainful than upset about the article, she started receiving angry mail from people who believed Rita's lies, and even Molly Weasley was upset with her until Harry set her straight. Rita with Harry Potter and Hermione Granger in the tent during the first task \nRita's last defaming article stated that Harry was \" disturbed and dangerous ,\" and used comments from Draco and his Slytherin cronies as its basis. Ultimately, Hermione discovered the means by which Rita spied on others and forced her to \" keep her quill to herself for a full yea r\" by catching her in her beetle form while she was perched on the Hospital Wing window and trapping her in a jar imbued with an Unbreakable Charm so she couldn't transform. Hermione threatened to Rita that she would report her to the authorities as an illegal Animagus to the Ministry of Magic , which would have severe legal consequences. Rita was forced to comply, and suffered financial strain as a result. [9] Unfortunately her last article would discredit Harry and serve as the basis for Cornelius Fudge to refuse to believe Harry's story about Voldemort's return that would start the Ministry's smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore. The Quibbler Rita : \" But of course, Little Miss Perfect wouldn't want that story out there, would she? \" Hermione Granger : \" As a matter of fact, that's exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want. \" Rita : \" You want me to report what he says about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? \" Hermione Granger : \" Yes, I do. The true story. All the facts. Exactly as Harry reports them. He'll give you all the details, he'll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he'll tell you what Voldemort looks like now... I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth! \" — Rita and Hermione Granger discussing Voldemort's return [src] Rita getting the latest scoop \nIn 1995 , Harry Potter 's story that Lord Voldemort had returned was not believed by much of the wizarding world, as the Daily Prophet portrayed him as either a delusional boy or an attention-seeking liar. Hermione Granger wanted to get the truth to the public, and thus instructed Rita to meet her and Luna Lovegood in Hogsmeade on 14 February, 1996 in the Three Broomsticks. As it was Rita who laid the foundation for the Prophet's defamation of Harry, with her initial stories about him, Hermione wanted her to be the one to set the record straight. They were joined by Harry after his date with Cho Chang . Harry thought that Hermione and Rita were \" the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined. \" \nRita was initially taken aback that Hermione wanted her to interview Harry, and then resentful, since Hermione demanded that she only write exactly what Harry said and not portray him as the rest of the press was. Rita claimed the Prophet would not buy the story, reluctantly admitting that the Ministry of Magic was influencing it. Hermione told her that the interview would be printed in the Quibbler , which Luna's father edited, and although Rita responded with disdain, she \"eyed Hermione shrewdly\" for a few moments and then agreed. However, when she learned she was expected to conduct the interview free of charge, she was furious. Because Hermione was able to blackmail Rita with the threat of reporting her unregistered Animagus status to the Ministry, Rita grudgingly complied and wrote the article. [10] \nThe interview was subsequently printed in the Quibbler , and became its best-selling issue of all time. It was banned at Hogwarts by High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge , which seemed to only increase its popularity. [11] Editor Xenophilius Lovegood sold the article to the Prophet after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries , when Voldemort's return became public, and he and his daughter Luna used the money to travel to Sweden in search of the Crumple-Horned Snorkack . [12] The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore \" Harry next recognised Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-takmed hand. \" —Rita makes an appearance at Dumbldore's funeral [src] Rita was present at the funeral of Albus Dumbledore \nRita made a brief appearance at the end of Harry's 1996-1997 school year, where he was infuriated to notice her clutching a notebook at Dumbledore's funeral in June 1997 [13] . It was, perhaps, her being present at the funeral that prompted her to write a biography of Albus Dumbledore , as within four weeks Skeeter wrote a 900-page tell-all biography about him, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore . This book also included authentic old photos of the famed Hogwarts headmaster Rita at a book signing for The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore \nThe book depicted the former headmaster in an extremely negative light but was mostly based on truth, much to Harry's horror. It was implied that she got some of her information in unethical or illegal ways, as much of the book's content was obtained through an interview Rita conducted with Bathilda Bagshot , a very elderly historian, where Skeeter used Veritaserum to gain information about Dumbledore’s childhood. Skeeter stole photographs from Bagshot as well, and the subsequent novel sensationalised everything, implying that Dumbledore had dabbled in the Dark Arts and contributed to the death of his sister. \nIt turned out that Rita got at least some of her facts straight for once, but had no idea of the true story, such as claiming that Ariana was a Squib when in reality she suffered from uncontrollable bursts of magic due to a highly traumatic experience when she was around six.
