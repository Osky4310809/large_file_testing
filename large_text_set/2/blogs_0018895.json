I love Xavier's uniform and his relationship with all islanders.Even when Maubee is tearing down the house, he has a smile on his face. Even when Xavier forgets to pick up his son and finds him hours later, alone and in the dark, it's not the end of the world, the child is entertaining himself and he forgives his father - easily.These island inhabitants are comfortable to watch. What my grandmother would have called \"easy in their skin.\"\"Don't you know this is a goin' down road?\"I love that line.And I love a place that would designate a mountain road \"a goin' down\" road during certain parts of the day.Also, this rendition of Bob Dylan \"Mighty Quinn\" is the easiest version to my ears. 13 of 17 people found this review helpful.
