A post shared by Camilo Encina (@sagnol_alreves) on Mar 1, 2017 at 3:00pm PST \n\"We don't want him to play at Real Madrid, nor go back to Barcelona, we don't give a f*ck where he plays, we just want him to fight along with other 10 players to get the results. \n\"He doesn't deserve to be alone.\" \nWhile the protest originally started out as a joke it quickly gained traction with the protest attracting attention from media outlets all over the world. \n\"It was a joke, since the first day, and it's clear for all,” the organiser wrote. “But we never thought that media from 17 countries would cover this thing (...) so it's simple: we'll stop this joke today... \n\"See you 7pm at Plaza Baquedano. The first to arrive climbs up the monument with an Alexis shirt. If it's an Arsenal one people could possibly burn it so I suggest it should be a Chile National Team one.\" \nHowever, it seems as though Chileans are not actually that upset with Arsenal with just five people turning up, despite there having been 14,000 confirmations on Facebook.
