I remember meeting then Senator @barackobama 9 years ago. I'd been invited to introduce him in Nevada during the primaries. He was the underdog, the odds were stacked against him. Said he was too young, too black, too different...he was an other. I've always been an other so I saw myself in him. My own relative told me I was wasting my time, going state to state, knocking on doors for this guy with the funny name. I can't tell you how many people hung the phone up on my sister @jazzsmollettwarwell and me as we clocked in our hours, phone banking. Working as if this was a full time job, I worked for free, because this work was food for my soul. They whispered that you couldn't do it. That we couldn't do it. And then tried to block you even when we proved them wrong. TWICE. You will go down as the greatest president who did the most with the least help from his \"congressional leaders\". So I thank you for being you. Unapologetically. Your very existence demanded that I take the limits off my own. Before you, I lived in a world of boundaries and limits. You were audacious enough to dream big, and demanded we dream even bigger. So thank you for all you've given us. We will keep dreaming, keeping fighting, keep knocking on doors, keep traveling and spreading the gospel truth. Because it never was about you, it was about us, the \"others\". Yes we can. Yes we did. Yes we will.#powertothepeople ✊ #ThanksObama #tbt #mypresident \nA photo posted by Jurnee Smollett Bell (@jurneebell) on Jan 19, 2017 at 9:31pm PST \nOlivia Wilde This photo.
