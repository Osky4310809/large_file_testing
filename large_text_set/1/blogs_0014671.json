Yes, in what comes as a surprise to the viewers as well as the gharwale , Bigg Boss decides to marry Mona Lisa in the house. \nIt begins with Mona being summoned to the activity room and the moment she enters, she starts jumping with joy as she spots her boyfriend, Vikrant, in the room. Without further ado, he goes down on his knees and proposes to Mona. Such an ‘Aww’ moment, isn’t it? Soon after, Vikrant and Mona go to the house and meet the gharwale . As soon as the gharwale learn about the proposal, everyone is visibly happy. Thereafter, Bigg Boss announces that Mona and Vikrant will get married inside the Bigg Boss house and while Bani and Manveer will represent the ladke wala , Lopa, Rohan and Manu will be from Mona’s side. \nThereafter, Bigg Boss announces the haldi ceremony of Vikrant and Mona and requests the gharwale to make the ceremony as entertaining as they can. Amid a lot of dance, joy and fanfare, the haldi ceremony takes place. \nBut after the ceremony, Vikrant is seen rebuking Mona for letting Om Swami give her a massage on the back. While Mona tries to defend herself, Manu jumps in and criticizes Mona’s decision of letting Om Swami touch her. So much so that Vikrant reprimands Mona for letting people touch any part of her body. \nBut we can only wait to witness their marriage ceremony that will take place tomorrow in the Bigg Boss house.
