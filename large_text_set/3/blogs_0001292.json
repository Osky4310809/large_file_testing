March 2, 2017, at 4:36 p.m. Cancel \nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate says the Libertarian Party has obtained official political party status in Iowa. \nPate says the status began effective Wednesday after state election officials determined that the party's presidential nominee, Gary Johnson, received 59,186 votes — or 3.8 percent of the vote in the November 2016 general election. That surpassed the 2 percent threshold required by Iowa law to obtain official political party status. \nThe new status gives the Libertarian Party the ability to participate in primary elections in 2018. \"Libertarian\" will be included as an option for Iowans on voter registration forms. \nThe last time a third part gained political party status in Iowa was in 2000, when Green Party nominee Ralph Nader received 2.2 percent of the votes cast for president. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press .
