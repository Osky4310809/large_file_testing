Travelers noticed the change and were quick to post pictures to social media. Krystal Parrish was a passenger on the flight and captured the moment on Instagram.\nParrish captioned the photo, “When your Southwest flight crew celebrate a plane full of kickass women and men going to the Women’s March by lighting it up!! #lit #womensmarchonwashington #lovetrumpshate”\nA photo posted by Krystal Parrish (@kpmagnolia) on Jan 19, 2017 at 12:56pm PST \nParrish explained what happened to Refinery29 . She said that while the Southwest crew didn’t make an announcement before changing the lights, their intent was obvious. \n“I didn’t hear them say anything, but when they [turned on the lights] the whole plane recognized their intention and everyone started clapping,” Parrish told Refinery29. \nTwitter user Jennifer Moran was also on the flight, and she noted that the entire flight erupted in cheers when the lights changed to pink.\nSouthwest turns on the pink lights and a loud cheer erupts. #WomensMarch pic.twitter.com/Ft8ukziRVk \n— Jennifer MOran (@jgmoran2) January 19, 2017 \n“There was no announcement explicitly from the staff and no one screamed, ‘this is for the march,'” Moran told NBC Washington . “Nothing, just spontaneous and everyone knew exactly why they were cheering ,” \nIt warms our hearts to see a major company outwardly showing support for such an important cause. Southwest Airlines explained why the lighting was changed on only one flight and not all.\n“Some of our aircraft are equipped with mood lighting and while this was not a company-wide initiative, at times, our flight crews will adjust the lighting for a customer or group of customers traveling on their flight,” Southwest told NBC Washington . “For example, in October, one of our Flight Crews changed the lighting to honor a breast cancer survivor on board their flight.” \nIt was a beautiful gesture, and something we’re certain people won’t forget.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T04:22:47.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
