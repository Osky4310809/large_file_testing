The former Italy defender revealed his club were more interested in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang than Rooney, 31, and they are still trying to snap up Fiorentina's Nikola Kalinic, per Tianjin TV (h/t the Mirror 's Alex Richards ): \nWe did make an approach for Rooney, but it was just a chat because he simply doesn’t suit our style of play. No further discussion was necessary. \nThe truth is we had more frequent contact with Aubameyang. Unfortunately, our bid was rejected by Borussia Dortmund who said he was needed in this season’s Champions League. \nOur prime target is still Kalinic, but it’s quite difficult for his club to let him leave at the moment. Under such circumstances, we are caught in a dilemma. I need to communicate with our managing director.
