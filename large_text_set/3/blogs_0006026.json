Chalmers is said to have been impersonating pop singer Justin Bieber online (Photo: Getty) \nHe was charged last November with offences including possessing child exploitation material and grooming persons under 16. \nOpposing bail for Chalmers at the time, police said he had \"refused\" to give them access to his social media accounts and cloud servers. \nBut since then, further examination of his laptop has uncovered the full scale of his shocking offending, police said. \nSince 2007, Chalmers has been posing as Justin Bieber on platforms including Facebook and Skype to groom victims, it is claimed. \nPolice said \"a large amount\" of child exploitation material was discovered. Police say Chalmers used platforms including Facebook and Skype to groom his victims (Photo: Reuters) \nIt is not known what countries the man targeted, but police said the case demonstrated \"the global reach and skill\" that child sex offenders possess. \nThe man has now been charged with a further 931 offences including, rape, indecent treatment of children and making child exploitation material. \nDetective Inspector Jon Rouse said: \"This investigation demonstrates both the vulnerability of children that are utilising social media and communication applications and the global reach and skill that child sex offenders have to groom and seduce victims. \n\"The fact that so many children could believe that they were communicating with this particular celebrity highlights the need for a serious rethink about the way that we as a society educate our children about online safety. \n\"The breadth of offences committed in this instance are frankly horrendous and I want to recognise the efforts and commitment of the investigative team at Taskforce Argos to keeping children safe.\" \nChalmers is due back in court in Brisbane on April 6.
