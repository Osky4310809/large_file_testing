Commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross seemed to sail through his hearing as did Interior secretary nominee Rep. Ryan Zinke. \nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is nominated to United Nations Ambassador, broke with Trump on a number of foreign policy issues. And the three most contentious hearings were for Health and Human Services Secretary, Education Secretary and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Two more hearings will take place on Thursday, for Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin and Energy Secretary nominee Rick Perry. \nAfter two weeks of hearings on the Trump nominees, the senate's Democratic Leader made his attempt to size up the group as a whole late Wednesday, calling it \"a swamp cabinet full of bankers and billionaires.\" But, so far, none appear to be in immediate danger of being rejected by the GOP-controlled senate. \nIn case you couldn't catch them all, here are some of the main takeaways from the last two days of hearings: Tom Price Under Fire for His Stocks \nDemocrats pounded Rep. Tom Price, nomine to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, who is expected to be a critical player in the overhaul of the current health care system put in place under the Affordable Care Act. Democrats, eager to see Price and his views on health care defeated, pounded him over his financial activity pertaining to the health industry when he was legislating health related legislation.
