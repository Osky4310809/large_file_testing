A declaration born out of the toxic ashes of xenophobia and intolerance. \nLet us remind ourselves and wrap ourselves in the words of Article One of that declaration: \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood.\" Nowhere in there does it say Muslims are to be excluded. Nowhere in there does it say that torture is acceptable under any circumstances. Nowhere does it say Donald Trump has the right to undermine our human rights. Because an attack on one, be they Muslim, Mexican or gay, is an attack on all of us. So, Theresa May, listen up! \nWe the British people are telling you stop with the appeasement. Stop indulging a racist, torture-supporting, woman-hating, crypto fascist. Stop him from coming to this country until he lifts the ban on Muslims. That's because the EU referendum result did not give you a mandate to sell out on our British values. Did not give you permission to sell our NHS to Donald Trump and his corporate cronies. Did not give you permission to rip us away from our brothers and sisters in Europe and into the arms of Trump's America. My final plea is this. It's a plea to all the decent people of Stoke. Its clear the Tories have pulled back in Stoke to give Paul Nuttall of Ukip a clear run at Labour. In Richmond, progressive voters kicked out Zac Goldsmith - a man who conducted an outrageous racist mayoral campaign. They collectively kicked him out. Now I urge the progressive voters of Stoke to support the Labour candidate and stop the politics of Trump from coming to Westminster. \nClive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South, and the shadow secretary for business, energy and industrial strategy Follow Clive Lewis on Twitter: www.twitter.com/labourlewis More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:10:17.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
