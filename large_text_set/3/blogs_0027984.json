Playmobil (yes, the very same one that makes those cute kids’ toys) have joined forces to make a new line of 6″ Playmobil figures with a Funko twist . Seriously. Are you ready for this? I don’t think you are.\nNow just imagine what that means for your favorite fandom. You don’t have to, though, because there are several images that have already been released of some of the new figures. And you’ll be able to get your hands on Ghostbusters, Doctor Who, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Back to the Future, and Willy Wonka figures shortly, and they’re just as heart-rendingly cute as you’d imagine. Look at their little bodies and faces, and I just want to eat them all up!\nThe line of figures includes Marty McFly, Dr. Emmett Brown, Raphael, Michelangelo, Shredder, Leonardo, the Fourth Doctor, Eleventh Doctor, Oompa Loompas, Willy Wonka, Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Raymond Stantz, and I assume plenty more to come. Just look at their little expressions! Their outfits are picture-perfect! They might even come alive at night and start talking to you or something ridiculous like that. Probably not, but one can dream, right?\nIf Funko’s current run is any indication like the POP! Vinyl figures, hopefully, we’ll be seeing video game personalities and plenty of other characters coming on down the line soon. So if you’ve ever dreamt of carrying around some of these familiar faces around in your pocket, you’ll want to go ahead and jump on preordering them so when March comes around you’ll have some pretty exciting packages dropping at your house.\nView as: One Page Slides 1.
