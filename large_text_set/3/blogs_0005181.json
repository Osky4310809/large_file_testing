Just another terrible decision!” \nTrump’s comment came about a half hour after Fox News tweeted out a story about the subject. Former Gitmo detainee killed by a U.S. airstrike in Yemen; at least 122 former Gitmo detainees have re-engaged in terrorism pic.twitter.com/y9jb420fFZ — FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) March 7, 2017 \nTrump incorrectly blamed former President Obama for releasing the prisoners, however. It was actually under former President George W. Bush’s watch that 113 of the 122 were released, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Wrong POTUS, @realDonaldTrump . Your intel agencies report shows Bush released 113 of the 122 re-engagers from Gitmo. https://t.co/AvYSHDspfl pic.twitter.com/YZOVOrJS3O — Carol Rosenberg (@carolrosenberg) March 7, 2017 \nOn health care, Trump commented on the GOP’s replacement plan, which was released Monday. \n“Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast!” \nHe also said there's more to come that will promote competition. \n\"Don't worry, getting rid of state lines, which will promote competition, will be in phase 2 & 3 of healthcare rollout. @foxandfriends \" \n\"I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!\" \nAnd on Russia, Trump accused Obama of being too weak on Moscow. \n“For eight years Russia \"ran over\" President Obama, got stronger and stronger, picked-off Crimea and added missiles. Weak! @foxandfriends ” \nThis post has been updated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:22:36.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
