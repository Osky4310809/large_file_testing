The exercise is a continuation of the initiative which was implemented in 2008, and will involve 71 toll plazas between Juru (Penang), and Skudai (Johor). \n“The system is much faster than the cash method, with SmartTAG and Touch ‘n Go lanes capable of handling up to 1,000 and 600 transactions per hour, respectively,” said managing director Datuk Azman Ismail in a statement today. Towards the end of last year, PLUS announced that all of its highways will adopt the electronic toll collection system by 2017. \nCurrently, 94% of motorists on the Juru-Skudai stretch of the highway pay for tolls electronically, and PLUS will take measures to ensure that journeys on its highways are smooth with minimal interference from the electronic toll collection systems, Azman said.
