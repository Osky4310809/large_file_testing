( PEP ) and The Coca-Cola Co. ( KO ) are vying for footing in a market where consumers are increasingly turning toward healthier beverage options. SodaStream International Ltd. ( SODA ), meanwhile, has found itself in the perfect environment to beef up operating income by more than 200 percent. \nSoda consumption on a per capita basis dropped to the lowest level in 30 years in 2015, according to a recent Bloomberg article . That’s putting pressure on soda and snack makers to push healthier products such as Sabra hummus and Naked brand juices over items like Cheetos or Mountain Dew. \nPepsiCo Inc. (PEP) reported fourth quarter results Feb. 15 in which earnings of $1.20 per share beat Street estimates of $1.16 per share. But the beverage and snacks giant revealed lower-than-expected forecast for 2017 of $5.09 versus the Street view of $5.16 per share. CEO Indra Nooyi warned of “continued macroeconomic challenges ahead.” PepsiCo has been experiencing weakness in developing areas like Asia, North Africa and Middle East. \nPEP shares are up 3.3 percent year to date. Several analysts have reiterated Buy ratings in the wake of PepsiCo’s results including BMO Capital Markets, Credit Suisse Group and Jefferies Group LLC.

The Atlanta-based beverage company reported that sales volume of sparkling beverages declined by 2 percent. For the year ahead, Coca-Cola expects earnings will decline 1 percent to 4 percent.

On Feb. 16, Wells Fargo & Co. reiterated a Market Perform rating; Cowen & Co. reiterated a Market Perform rating; Jefferies Group reiterated a Hold rating while lowering its price target to $42 from $43. \nAs PepsiCo and Coca-Cola brace for a rough year ahead, SodaStream shares have strong momentum thanks to a booming demand for its home beverage carbonation systems. The Israeli company reported fourth quarter revenue increased 17 percent from the year prior to $131.8 million. Operating income was up 201% to an all-time high of $18.8 million. SODA shares are up 21 percent from the start of year and 294 percent in the past year. \n“Consumers are responding positively to our messaging around health and wellness, convenience and the environment,” said SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum in a statement. “There are meaningful growth opportunities still ahead of us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:16:27.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
