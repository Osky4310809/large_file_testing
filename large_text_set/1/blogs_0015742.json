I work for a fee, not for free.” Also Read: Garth Brooks Explains Why He Didn't Take Trump Inauguration Gig \nA Maples representative did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. \nKelly said she quoted the mother-daughter duo $150 to travel out of her salon to get them ready in private, on top of her menu of services. (A blowout, a typical service women in Hollywood receive before a big night out, starts at $55 per person per Kelly’s website .) \nThe person connecting Maples and Kelly said the former’s budget for hair and makeup capped at $300, but both Maples and her daughter felt the privilege of styling them — and shout-outs on platforms like Tiffany’s Instagram account with 532,000 followers — was more than sufficient payment. \n“There are people who make far less than they do who pay full price,” Kelly continued. “People on staff — the incoming White House and the outgoing one — pay full price. It seemed like they were trying to see how much they could get for free based on their names.” Also Read: Donald Trump's Inaugural Poem Is About Defeating a 'Tyrant' and Slavery \nIt would also appear that Trump’s knack for retaliation runs in the family — as once the Post reached out to a Maples spokesperson, Kelly heard from her original contact who tried to set her up with the Maples gig in the first place. \n“You are messing with the president of the United States,” the family friend allegedly said, adding that Maples’ finances have been precarious since Tiffany left college — thus ending her alimony payments from our future president. \nRead original story Marla Maples, Tiffany Trump Want Free Hair and Makeup for Inauguration At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.
