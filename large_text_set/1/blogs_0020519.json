That’s exactly what Chelsea fullback Ola Aina was doing last night on his Instagram as he and Arsenal’s Alex Iwobi showed off their dance moves live to a plethora of viewers. Among the many comments laughing and having fun with the young duo, two familiar names showed up to warn Mr. Aina of his ways. First came Cesar Azpilicueta to tell him that he has training in the morning and should probably wrap up soon and go to bed. via r/ChelseaFC Training is Azpilicueta’s middle name after all. While “Good cop” Dave approached the situation reasonably, Thibaut Courtois chose a slightly less diplomatic route, as he’s wont to do. “Bad cop” Courtois always tells it like it is: “Ola stop that sh*t man”. That’s the look of a man who knows he’s going to take some ... banter ... the following morning at the training ground. But no worries, I’m sure they all had a good laugh about at dinner later.

Funny guys.
