According to a press blast, Yeezy will show on Wednesday, February 15, at 5:00 p.m., a slot between Anna Sui and Thom Browne, currently also occupied by Marchesa. \nUnlike past seasons, where West took over Madison Square Garden and the bottom half of Roosevelt Island, this season’s show is slated to take place at Pier 59 Studios at Chelsea Piers. That venue, which provides designers a studio format they can rework into a presentation or a runway show, is much more familiar to the fashion set—and much easier to access. \nAs for the collection, West and Kim Kardashian West have been teasing Calabasas-branded merchandise on social media for nearly a year, leading fans to believe a release of the city merch is imminent. If the Wests’ new Instagram style is anything to go by, the suburban ’90s vibe will also be strong. Check Vogue.com on February 15 for live coverage of every look and all the Kardashian sightings of the day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:21:30.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
