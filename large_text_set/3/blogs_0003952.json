Gen. H.R. McMaster on Tuesday by a vote of 23-2. McMaster was President Trump's second choice after Michael Flynn was pressured to resign after misleading Vice President Pence on his communication with the Russian government. \nUsually the president’s choice in national security adviser does not require congressional approval, but McMaster is an exception because he still works for the military. \nMcMaster was approved despite controversy over his decision in 2015 to allow two lieutenants to attend the Army Ranger School while they were under investigation for assault. The Army inspector general at the time concluded McMaster had violated the rules. Yet, according to the report, McMaster saw no reason to stymie the soldiers’ careers because they had not been proven guilty. \nThe issue was enough to lose McMaster the vote of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) on Tuesday. \n\"General McMaster was more concerned about hampering these men's careers than following the rules in pursuit of justice,\" she said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:59:43.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
