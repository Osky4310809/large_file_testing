Yes, I just warned against spoilers for a trailer. It's like that now.\nPeter Parker is just trying to hold it all together.\n\"It all\" being the Staten Island Ferry, which is breaking in two parts — split lenghtwise — in the new trailer for Spider-Man: Homecoming . It's the money shot: Spidey is using his webs to literally stitch together a giant boat full of passengers. And he's got some help arriving on the big ferry's flank.\nThat'd be Iron Man, who is spending most of this second trailer admonishing Parker to ease into this superhero role thing — but he's clearly enabling Peter here, and not just with Spidey's new suit. He's in on the action. And there's a lot of action to look at here.\nSony Pictures Entertainment wasn't set to release its second full Spider-Man: Homecoming trailer until Tuesday morning, but sneaked it Monday night at Cinemacon in Las Vegas.\nSEE ALSO: Everything you may have missed in the 'Stranger Things' Season 2 teaser\nFollowing an exclusive sizzle reel at Comic-Con last summer, Sony released its first full-length trailer in December , then earlier Monday teased six seconds of its Homecoming trailer. Sony sneaked that trailer at the annual gathering of cinema owners from around the world, who come to Ceasar's Palace every year to see what Hollywood has coming up in summer and fall.\nThe pressure is on the studios to bring their biggest stars and even bigger footage to Vegas — and do superhero movies get bigger than Spider-Man?\nWhile that first trailer leaned hard into Spidey's high-school life (and there was plenty of that, don't worry), this second trailer is heavy on the action, and even heavier on the Tony Stark/Peter Parker dynamic.\n\"So what do you have to do to be in the Avengers, is there like trials or a tryout or ... ?\" Parker asks Stark in a quiet moment in the car.\n\"Do me a favor, will you?\" Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) replies. \"Just focus on being a friendly, neighborhood Spider-Man right now.\"\nWe also see our villain, The Vulture (Michael Keaton) speechifying for the first time, and it seems he's starting out by trying to recruit Parker to his side — the side of the \"little guy.\"\n\"The rich and powerful like Stark, they don't care about us,\" Keaton says.\nOh, but we do, Vulture. We already care very much.\nSony was just the first of the major studios to present at Cinemacon, where all six major studios — plus smaller fish like STX and Amazon — are on hand to impress their exhibition partners throughout the week.\nSpider-Man: Homecoming swings into theaters July 7.\nWATCH: France's 'Spider-Man' just climbed a 38-story skyscraper without a rope in 30 minutes.", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/HGZqNwkH.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/HGZqNwkH.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-28T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:59:27.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
