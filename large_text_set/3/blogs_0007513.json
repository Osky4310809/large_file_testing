By: FE Online | Published: March 8, 2017 4:41 PM Mahadeshwar after being elected the mayor of the richest municipal corporation, BMC, he said he would focus on ridding the city of potholes and encroachments, and address water shortage,” the report said.(IE) \nA report in the city-based tabloid Mid-Day said he is one of the most educated corporators in the civic body. “A Ramnarain Ruia College graduate, he was previously principal of Raje Sambhaji Vidyalaya and Junior College in Santacruz. Mahadeshwar after being elected the mayor of the richest municipal corporation, BMC, he said he would focus on ridding the city of potholes and encroachments, and address water shortage,” the report said. \nThe mayoral election was expected to be a tight contest between Shiv Sena and BJP , as the two parties finished neck and neck in the recently concluded BMC polls. The new mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar has been attached to Shiv Sena for last 34 years. Sena emerged the single largest party, with 84 seats, while BJP followed a close second with 82. However, with the two parties unable to see eye-to-eye on a post-poll alliance, amid speculation and backdoor negotiations, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis surprised everybody with a startling announcement on Saturday, saying his party will stay away from the mayor race. \nYou may also like to watch: \nHowever, sources say that Mahadeshwar is facing legal trouble after a case has been filed in the court challenging his election. Local leader of the Congress Dharmesh Vyas, who filed a petition, said, “As a principal of a government-aided school, he had suppressed the information that he was drawing a salary from government grants which makes him ineligible even to become a corporator.” \nThe matter would be heard on April 6. Another independent candidate from the same ward, Mahendra Pawar too has filed a case alleging that a mayoral candidate has purchased his current flat by “flouting the rules”. The hearing in the matter will take place on March 23.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T13:18:38.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
