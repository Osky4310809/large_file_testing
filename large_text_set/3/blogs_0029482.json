Even the doctors and surgeons wouldn’t be terribly sure,” said O’Neill of the timeline for his recovery to full fitness. media_camera Ireland's Seamus Coleman is taken off the pitch. \n“It will take some time, but Seamus has great determination and sometimes those things work very much in your favour, in terms of recovery. \n“I know the doctors and surgeons are all very, very pleased with the way the operation has gone and now it’s time for recuperation. \nHe added: “It’s a devastating blow for the lad. He was having a phenomenal season at his club and a phenomenal season for us as captain.” \nTeammate Shane Long revealed he used tips from his wife’s pregnancy to help Coleman after the incident. \nLong’s wife Kayleah told The Sun : “I had a hypnotherapy birth and they taught Shane to help me to breathe through it. media_camera Seamus Coleman (L). \n“He told me: ‘It all came back to me. I was just talking to Seamus, teaching him how to breathe through it.’ He remembered it all. \n“I asked if Seamus was listening to him and he said, ‘Yes, to be fair, he was. He was really breathing well.” \nROSE TO CITY, SHAW TO SPURS: REPORT \nPep Guardiola is confident of signing Tottenham’s Danny Rose for £50 million ($82m) this summer, which could see Luke Shaw move to Spurs as his replacement, according to The Mirror. \nThe Manchester City manager has reportedly been eyeing the full-back as he rebuilds his squad, with Gael Clichy, Bacary Sagna and skipper Vincent Kompany all set to leave. \nAs Spurs are building a new £750m ($1.2bn) stadium, they are reportedly not in a position to turn down such a large offer for Rose. media_camera Tottenham Hotspur's English defender Danny Rose (L) vies with Manchester City's English midfielder Raheem Sterling. \nIf Rose leaves the club, then Tottenham would reportedly target Manchester United’s fullback Shaw in a transfer, which would help to save £20-30m overall. \nShaw has started few matches under Jose Mourinho this season, with mainly cup outings to his name. \nAt 21 years old and wanting to play regular football, Spurs may be able to lure him to White Hart Lane. media_camera England's defender Luke Shaw (2R) takes part in a training session. \nAUBA’S GLOW-IN-THE-DARK HAIRCUT \nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang just became even cooler. \nNot only is he one of the world’s best football players, but he has a new haircut that glows in the dark. \nPaul Pogba has been the king of hair styles until now, so will he see this as a challenge?
