Peston savages Thornberry in car-crash interview 'You haven't clarified migration at all!' Peston savages Thornberry in car-crash interview ROBERT Peston was left dumbfounded as Labour's Emily Thornberry went through an entire interview without clarifying Labour's migration position PUBLISHED: 11:32,  35, Sun, Jan 15, 2017 \nEmily Thornberry told Peston On Sunday that Labour were not going to \"die in a ditch\" over European freedom of movement . \nThe ITV presenter asked the Labour Shadow Foreign Secretary during this morning's show to clarify Labour's flip-flop positions on migration . \nShe explained that Britain badly needs migration to prop up the country's construction industry and health service. \nHowever, the MP then appeared to contradict her leader, Jeremy Corbyn , when she mentioned Britain needed \"managed migration\". ITV Emily Thornberry told Peston On Sunday that Labour were not going to \"die in a ditch\" over migration \nAfter a week of migration policy flip-flops from Labour's shadow cabinet, Peston asked: \"There is so much confusion about your positon. What is it exactly?\" \nMrs Thornberry said: \"We are not going to die in a ditch over freedom of movement European-style. \n\"The economy is most important thing. We have to be looking after economy. \n\"Labour will be looking to achieve fair rules and properly managed migration.\" ITV Social media reaction laid into the Labour MP for the muddled position You have not made Labour's migration policy any clearer Robert Peston \nThe Corbyn ally went on to acknowledge \"the anxiety throughout the country\" about migration coming from the EU. \nShe said: \"But if you look at the health crisis in the NHS at the moment, why we are the health service having to scour around the world, hovering up nurses from the Philippines? \n\"We are not training enough nurses, we donâ€™t have enough doctors. One in four doctors will retire in the next few years. \n\"Why do we have builders coming in from Europe? We are not training enough at home. We don't have enough apprenticeships.\" ITV Thornberry said the UK badly needs migration to prop up our construction industry and health service GETTY Thornberry appeared to contradict her leader, Jeremy Corbyn, when she mentioned \"managed migration\" \nHowever, at the end of her remarks, Peston told the MP that Labour MPs would still be confused about what the party stands for, before adding: \"You have not made it clearer\". \nMrs Thornberry laughed this off and said: \"I've done my best.\" \nSocial media reaction laid into the Labour MP for the muddled position. \nOne user said: \"Emily Thornbury confirms the economy comes first and migrants are needed desperately. So immigration will not be cut but increased!\" \nAnother added: \"I'm so glad Emily Thornberry has cleared up Labour policy. No dying in ditches. Clear policy I see.\" \nA viewer also remarked: \"Emily Thornberry 100% clear on total lack of clarity.\" \nLater in the interview, the left-wing politician also appeared to contradict Mr Corbyn on Labour's position on NATO. \nDespite a Corbyn spokesman raising questions over NATO troops in Estonia, Mrs Thornberry said Britain needed to show \"a strong commitment to NATO\". \nShe said Labour would have sent the troops if they were in power to counter Mr Putin's \"saber-rattling\".
