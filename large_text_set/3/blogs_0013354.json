And then we’d see what the story is, but yeah, I dunno, that’d be weird, but why not?” He added, “People die, stories don’t, people in stories don’t.\" \nWhile you might suspect interest in the franchise may have waned since the 2003 sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions , failed to live up the 1999 original, you would be mistaken. Just the possibility of a fourth Matrix film with its original stars and creators, though a long-shot, was generally met with enthusiasm. \nHowever, that possibility has now been all but snuffed out. This past week, it was reported that Warner Bros. is planning to reboot The Matrix without involvement from the Wachowskis and have already hired Zak Penn, the co-writer of X2: X-Men United and X-Men: The Last Stand , to pen the script. On top of that, Fantastic Four and Creed star Michael B. Jordan is being eyed for the leading role, which could be a young Morpheus. \nSee how the internet reacted to the news by clicking on \" Start Slideshow .\" \nMORE: Michael B. Jordan Could Be Cast In Matrix Reboot / Warner Bros. Looking Into More Matrix Movies / Keanu Reeves Would Do A Fourth Matrix If These Conditions Are Met / How to do The Next Matrix Movie Right \nThe Matrix (1999) - The box-office sensation follows the trials of a young computer programmer ( Keanu Reeves ) searching to determine the deepest reality of a post-Apocalyptic world. His journey uncovers a web of deceit and massive computer-generated illusions obscuring the truth. As the character Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) said to Neo (Reeves), “No one can be told what The Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.” The same is true for this mind-blowing movie. The film also stars Carrie-Anne Moss and was produced by Joel Silver. \nThe Matrix was written and directed by Lilly and Larry Wachowski, who spent years nurturing and refining the movie’s breakthrough concepts. \nOn a $63 million production budget, The Matrix grossed $463.5 million for WB.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T05:20:48.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
