Getty Images And things get really underhanded when the royal wants out of a meeting at Buckingham Palace — she presses a hidden buzzer that signals her staff to quickly usher the guests out of the room.\nThe queen isn’t the only one in the family with a literal bag of tricks — Kate Middleton carries a clutch in front of her to avoid awkward handshakes, etiquette expert Myka Meier told Good Housekeeping .\nAnd the monarchical males have clandestine cold-shoulder techniques, too.\nPrince Philip cruises past long lines of guests by making a special “sweeping motion” when taking their hands, swinging from left to right to propel himself forward along the line, Vickers said.\nAnd Prince Charles is always ready with a quick quip to interrupt conversations so he can make a hasty retreat.\n“Prince Charles has a quick ‘ha ha,’ and that enables him to break the conversation,” Vickers said.\nThe queen’s handbag isn’t just a distraction device. The royal matriarch always totes around a matching purse, a mirror, a glasses case, mints, and a handkerchief.\nThe queen reportedly owns more than 200 custom bags from designer Sam Launer, which she has been collecting since 1968.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T05:25:27.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
