Shahid Kapoor falls… Oh no! Shahid Kapoor falls for a FAKE viral pic Shahid Kapoor fell for an internet hoax. The picture that won pic of the decade has been going viral for all the wrong reasons. Read the full story. By Aarti Iyengar | Updated: February 15, 2017 12:56 pm Virat Kohli, Deepika Padukone and Kriti Sanon: Celebs spotted at the airport \nJust like everyone else, even Shahid Kapoor seems to have been fooled by this viral fake story of a pic clicked by Alison Buttigieg. In case you’re unaware of this, the award winning pic of the decade, that has been lauded by people for it’s heartwrenching backstory. However, the story that has found itself popular on social media is fake. And guess what, a naive Shahid also fell for it and wrote a touching post on his Instagram. So the actor shared the pic of an impala deer being attacked by two cheetahs with a sob story that will definitely make you cry. It said, “This photo won the award for the best photo of the decade and led the photographer into depression. The cheetahs chased a mother deer and her 2 fawns (baby deers), the mother could’ve easily outrun the cheetahs but instead, she offered herself to cheetahs so that her kids could manage to run to safety. In the picture, she is seen looking at her babies running safely as she is about to get torn into pieces…” Wow, that’s quite the best script for a soap opera. \nAnyway, so Shahid shared this post and captioned it, “No man can match up to what a mother does. Women are superior to men in so many ways. Let’s learn to appreciate them. And learn to show them love. Every day,” with utmost honesty. You can tell that the actor meant each and every word he said. But sadly, the story isn’t really. Just a few days ago, after this pic became pic of the decade, several viral stories started surfacing where the backstory of the pic was stated.

She took to her Facebook page and posted, A highlight of my photography career has turned into a nightmare. My Stranglehold photo went viral in a huge way with a completely ridiculous fake story accompanying it, and implications I fell into depression after I took it (seriously who comes up with this crap?!?) – not to mention the gross copyright violations. Sensationalism at its best – complete fiction so that people get more likes on their page. The photo with the fake story has been shared hundreds of thousands of times on various social media. I am getting inundated by hundreds and hundreds of messages asking me whether I am the “depressed photographer”. I have been tagged in LinkedIn with the fake story – that’s going to do wonders for my career. What a vile world we live in, full of stupid gullible people spreading #fakenews like crazy.” Obviously, her anger and the ‘pissed off’ mood is completely justifiable as it was breach of copyright. \nOn her website, she chronicled the exact episode that occurred on the day she shot this picture. Alison revealed that the pic was clicked in Maasai Mara, Kenya, on September 2013. The mother cheetah was actually teaching her kids how to kill a prey. However, as the kids were a little slow, the doomed impala stood still. She stated that perhaps due to fear and shock, the impala was unable to move from its position and therefore, throughout its ordeal, it maintained a calm composure. Finally, after the whole practise session were done, the mother cheetah went for the kill. All the pics from the sad incident can be found right HERE . \nMaybe Shahid gave this piece of news a miss. However, we’re really happy with the message he put up. There was a lot of genuineness and honesty in what he said, even if he did get fooled by this fake story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:56:22.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
