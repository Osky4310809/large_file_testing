Roberto Martinez feels the Premier League is the toughest league in the world for both players and managers. \n\"Today, we just have the Premier League,\" he added. \"But I'll draw conclusions at the end of the season. \n\"Thanks to the experience I have picked up, I now know how to handle the situation. You have to adapt, stay calm and continue working. \n\"The aim is to become a first-team regular at Liverpool, and I'm perhaps not all that far away. \n\"For the moment, I'm focused on Liverpool. I try to show my qualities when the coach puts me in. I think I've done that well up to now.\" \nOrigi also remains down the pecking order at international level, with Everton forward Lukaku ahead of him in coach Roberto Martinez's plans for the World Cup qualifier with Greece on Saturday. \n\"If I play so little it's also because I'm at a big club where it's more difficult to get into the starting lineup than it is at Everton,\" Origi added. \n\"That takes nothing away from Romelu's qualities and what he has done.\" \nIan is ESPN's French football correspondent.
