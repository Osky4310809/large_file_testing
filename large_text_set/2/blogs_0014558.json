The 29-year-old Swiss defender will join United pending receipt of his P1 work visa, which may not be processed in time for him to be available for the team's MLS debut against the Portland Timbers on March 3. \nTo pave the way for Thiesson's acquisition, Minnesota is sending $50,000 in general allocation money to Toronto FC, which held the player's discovery rights. \nSwiss newspaper Blick first reported the link between Minnesota and Thiesson on Sunday. \nThiesson has spent parts of the past six seasons at Luzern, and will be expected to compete for the starting right back spot on Adrian Heath's Minnesota defense. \nThe Loons back line will feature Costa Rican national team defender Francisco Calvo and Norwegian defender Vadim Demidov in central defense, with NASL veteran Justin Davis expected to play at left back. Longtime NASL defender Kevin Venegas should be Thiesson's top competition for the right back spot.
