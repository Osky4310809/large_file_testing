Lee. Arkansas Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson, however, has made a controversial effort to cut Lee off from the holiday.\n\"I think this provides our state an opportunity to bridge divides,\" Hutchinson told the Associated Press (AP). He has vowed since early last year to make the change, and has presented it as part of his agenda for the legislative session which began last week.\nArkansas has celebrated Lee's January 19 birthday since 1947, and King's January 15 birthday since 1983. In 1985, the legislature voted to combine the holidays.\nLee remains one of the most magnetic figures of the Civil War. He chose to fight for the Confederacy despite his personal desire for the country to remain intact, and despite a tempting offer from the Union's military. His prowess kept the South in the war far longer than expected, and earned undying respect among both North and South.\nNevertheless, there has been a nationwide re-evaluation of monuments and symbols from the Civil War and the Confederacy in particular. After the 2015 shooting at Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, pundits started attacking the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia, commonly known as the \"Confederate Flag.\" (The shooter, Dylann Roof, has been sentenced to death .)\nIn July 2015, the flag was removed from in front of the South Carolina State House. In Alabama, Governor Robert Bentley took down four Confederate flags on Capitol grounds. Southern Baptists voted against the flag in June of last year . When \"White Lives Matter\" activists protested at the NAACP in Texas last August, they prominently displayed the flag as a statement of racial heritage.\nLast year, Arkansas Democrats announced they would remove the names of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson from their party's annual fundraising dinner, echoing the decisions of other states also distancing themselves from these slave-owning presidents.\nSome shot back against Gov. Hutchinson's proposal to remove Robert E. Lee from the celebrations of Martin Luther King Day.\n\"It's like telling our Hispanic neighbors that we're not going to do Cinco de Mayo. It's like telling the Irish we're not going to celebrate St. Patrick's Day,\" Robert Edwards, commander of the Arkansas Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, told the AP. \"I think it's just a racist bill.\"\nShocker: Most College Students Think America Invented Slavery\nEdwards is not alone. When the bill was first introduced two years ago, opponents filled a House committee room to speak out against the idea.\nMeanwhile, some Democrats say they will not support the bill if it also sets aside a separate day to honor Robert E. Lee (some activists have pushed for a day in October, which would not be an official state holiday).\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/16/arkansas-gov-wants-to-cut-robert-e-lee-from-martin-luther-king-day/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/confederate-flag-removed-from-south-carolina-statehouse-1436538782", "https://www.yahoo.com/news/arkansas-tries-strip-gen-lee-martin-luther-king-154638579.html"], "published": "2017-01-16T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:49:08.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
