Snowed out hat-trick in MLS 0:52 \nARE REAL MADRID THE BEST ATTACKING TEAM IN HISTORY? \nCristiano Ronaldo scored his 366th league goal in Real Madrid’s win over Real Betis. That equalled the all-time record for league goals in Europe’s top five competitions, but the goal also brought up a record for Real Madrid. \nThey can now claim to be the best attacking team in history. \nWhy? \nBecause Ronaldo’s goal, Real’s first in a 2-1 win, was the 48th straight match where the Spanish giants had got on the scoresheet. \nThat beat Benfica’s 50 year record of scoring in 47 consecutive matches between December 1963 and January 1965. \nDuring Real’s run of 48 games scoring, they have won 34 times and lost just three. \nBRAZILIAN GAME DESCENDS INTO UTTER CHAOS \nA Brazilian lower league game between Gama and Brasilience has descended into utter chaos. \nAfter an innocuous foul left two rival players on the floor, a mass brawl between the players ensued, with punches and kicks being thrown. \nThen the fans got in on the action, with supporters invading the pitch, leading to riot police being called, tear gas being used and fans forced to climb over the stadium’s perimeter walls to escape. Brazilian stadium evacuation 1:12 \nINCREDIBLE PUNISHMENT FOR STOMP \nShanghai Shenhua have dished out some incredible punishment for midfielder Qin Sheng, for his stomp on Belgian midfielder Axel Witsel in the Chinese Super League. \nHaving been sent off for the incident, Sheng has now felt the full wrath of his club, fined $55,000 by club president Wu Xiaohui. Qin punished for nasty stamp 0:45 \nBut it doesn’t stop there. \nSheng has also been dropped to Shenhua’s reserve team, forced him to issue a public apology and warned they could yet decide to cut his annual salary as punishment. \nThe club’s statement read: “In the 24th minute, Greenland Shenhua player Qin Sheng deliberately stamped on the foot of his opponent in the box, and was shown a red card by the referee. His behaviour was against sportsmanship. \n“The club will see his attitude and follow-up performances, and decide whether to cut his annual salary. When purchasing competitive achievements, the club will not loosen its management over players. We will take this as a lesson and avoid incidents like this.” \nWe can’t imagine Manchester United will take similar action with Marcos Rojo... Rojo's vicious Hazard stomp 0:15 \nFERNANDO TORRES RETURNS TO TRAINING \nAtletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres has returned to training after recovering from a sickening head clash, suggesting he could play in Thursday morning’s Champions League tie against Bayer Leverkusen (AEDT). \nTorres lost consciousness in a challenge with Deportivo la Coruna’s Alex Bergantinos in a 1-1 draw on March 2 but was later discharged from hospital with no serious injuries. \nDespite rejoining his team-mates on the training pitch, the 32-year-old has yet to receive the all-clear from doctors though, the club indicated. \nAtletico coach Diego Simeone last week said he believed Torres would be fit in time for the last 16 second leg at the Vicente Calderon, where Atletico will look to defend their 4-2 lead. \nThe forward came off the bench to score Atletico’s fourth goal in the first leg in Germany but has been sidelined for the team’s last two games in La Liga \nEX-LIVERPOOL STAR SACKED AFTER 25 DAYS \nRemember the name Momo Sissoko? \nThe former Liverpool, Juventus and Valencia midfielder has just had his contract cancelled with Serie B side Ternana … after less than a month. \nTerana had announced the signing of Sissoko on a six-month contract, a deal described as a major coup for the minnows. \nBut when Sissoko was “intolerant to the technical choices” made by manager Fabio Liverani, i.e. refusing to sit on the bench, his contract was terminated after just 25 days.
