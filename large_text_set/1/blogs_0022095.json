(Photo: PETER PARKS, AFP/Getty Images) \nMELBOURNE — Rafael Nadal was the last of the four great champions to cooperate in setting up a fairytale final weekend of tennis at the Australian Open this year. \nIn a nod to age, experience and talent, Rafael Nadal will play old rival Roger Federer in the men’s final on Sunday, while sisters Serena and Venus Williams will contest an all-Williams final for the women’s trophy on Saturday. \nThe ninth-seeded Nadal completed the dream foursome by capturing a 4-hour, 56-minute battle of attrition, that showcased scintillating tennis, sheer willpower and determination, to win an epic 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (4), 6-4 semifinal against 15th-seeded Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria. \n“It is time to be happy, very happy,” Nadal said. “I have a fantastic match. Very emotional. I think Grigor played great. I played great. So it was a great quality match tonight.” \nIt’s never happened before in the Open Era that all four singles finalists at a Grand Slam are aged 30-and-over. \nPHOTOS: Best of the Australian Open semifinals Facebook Posted!

Venus Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam champion, is the oldest at 36. And Nadal, who has 14 Grand Slam trophies, is the baby of the group at 30. \n“Probably is a unique situation,” Nadal said. “Let’s enjoy this because probably will not happen again. Just well done for both of the sisters. Going to be a great moment, too.” \nNow Nadal will compete for a 15th Grand Slam trophy, and a second here at the Australian Open. If he achieves the victory, Nadal would become the only man in the Open Era, and the third in history along with Australians Rod Laver and Roy Emerson, to win each major at least twice in their career. \n“For me, it’s amazing to be through to a final of a Grand Slam again here in Australia, at the first (major) of the year,” Nadal said. \nWhat makes the Nadal and Federer final so surprising is that both had short seasons last year because of injury. Nadal had a left wrist injury that plagued him throughout much of the year, while Federer skipped the last six months because of a knee injury. \nNow they’ll both contend for another Grand Slam title. Nadal won his last major — a record ninth trophy at the French Open — in 2014. Federer won his last at Wimbledon in 2012. \n“It’s special to play with Roger again in a final of a Grand Slam,” said Nadal, who won all three of their previous meetings at Melbourne Park. “I cannot lie. Is great. Is exciting for me, for both of us that we still there and we still fighting for important events.” \nThe left-handed Nadal has had the upper-hand throughout his career with Federer, and currently leads their head-to-head 23-11, with 21 of those matches taking place in finals. \nBut Nadal doesn’t believe the past will effect the future that is ahead on Sunday. \n“That was a long time ago,” Nadal said. “This is a different match, different moment for both of us. I think the player who is better is going to be the winner.” \nThree of their previous encounters have taken place here at the Australian Open — one in the 2009 final — and Nadal has always been the winner at Melbourne Park. \nIt was well after midnight but no one left the stadium in a rush to get home early as Nadal and DImitrov battled. They stayed. They cheered. They were rewarded for their loyalty with a rare match in which the tennis quality just kept getting better and better. \nBy the fifth set, there was no sign of fatigue as the warriors struck balls ferociously, mixing it up with deft shots of touch and skill. \nIn the end it was the more seasoned Nadal who finally took advantage of a fifth break point in the fifth set — he had three in the first game, one in the fifth game, but couldn’t convert on those advantages. The one that put Nadal in position to win came in the ninth game — it was 30-40 and Nadal hit a backhand down the line to where Dimitrov couldn’t retrieve the ball. \nAll that was left was for Nadal to serve it out in the next game, which he did when a Dimitrov backhand landed long on a third match point. \nNadal believes that Friday’s match was another example of why it would be a mistake for the men not to play best-of-five set matches at the Grand Slams. There are occasional suggestions the men should switch to best-of-three sets at the majors like they play the rest of the year. \n“These type of matches, even for the body, destroys your body, but that’s tennis,” he said. “That’s special. Much more special than playing best-of-three. Should be like this, in my opinion.” 472 CONNECT 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
