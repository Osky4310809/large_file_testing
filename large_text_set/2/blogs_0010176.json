Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks on the floor of the U.S. Senate in Washington, Feb. 6, 2017, about the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Education Secretary. The Senate will be in session around the clock this week as Republicans aim to confirm more of President Donald Trump's Cabinet picks over Democratic opposition. (Senate TV via AP) \nWASHINGTON • Sen. Roy Blunt joined other Republicans Tuesday night and voted to formally silence Sen. Elizabeth Warren mid-speech for bad-mouthing Jeff Sessions, an Alabama senator nominated for attorney general. \nBut in 2009, Blunt, R-Mo., struck a different posture towards Congressional decorum. \nBack then Washington was debating President Barack Obama's health care proposal when, in September of that year, the president touted his plan in a primetime speech to a joint session of Congress. Obama was saying the legislation would not cover illegal immigrants when a shout cut across the chamber: \"You lie!\" \nIt was Republican Rep. Joe Wilson, a fourth-term Congressman from South Carolina. He pointed at Obama and yelled a second time that Obama was lying. (In fact, the Affordable Care Act does not allow undocumented immigrants to purchase health insurance , though some conservatives have pointed to loopholes .) \nObama paused as lawmakers booed the outburst, then continued with his speech. Wilson later apologized. The House voted 240-179 the following week to censure Wilson, saying his conduct \"degraded\" the chamber. \nBlunt, then a Congressman from Springfield who had stepped down from House Republican leadership to run for Senate, voted against censuring Wilson. Six years earlier Blunt had named Wilson to his whip team. \nTuesday night in the Senate, Democrats were speaking against Sessions' record as a federal prosecutor in Alabama during the 1970s and 1980s. Allegations of racial insensitivity and prejudice, including his unsuccessful prosecution of black civil rights activists on allegations of voting fraud , sunk his 1986 nomination as a federal judge. Sessions has repudiated those charges by pointing to his work prosecuting klansmen and integrating schools: \"This caricature of me from 1986 was not correct.\" \nWarren, an outspoken liberal from Massachusetts, took to the Senate floor to read a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott King opposing Session's nomination to the federal bench. Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow wrote it was \"reprehensible\" for Session to use his office \"in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.\" \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell interrupted Warren's speech to invoke the chamber's rule forbidding Senators from impugning the \"motives or integrity\" of a fellow senator. \nBlunt joined other Republicans in a 49-43 party-line vote to sustain the rebuke, which forbids Warren from further debate on Sessions' nomination. \nA spokesman for Blunt said the senator thought the remarks were inappropriate and clearly violated the chamber's rules, which have been in place for more than a century. \n\"Senate rules have no bearing on the House of Representatives and vice versa,\" Brian Hart, Blunt's communication director, said. \nOther Senate Republicans who served in the House in 2009 — including Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia and Jerry Moran of Kansas — also voted against censuring Wilson but supported silencing Warren. \nJeff Flake, now one of Arizona's senators, was one of seven Republican House members to support reprimanding Wilson. He also voted Tuesday to rebuke Warren. \nVice President Mike Pence, who was an Indiana Congressman in 2009, voted against admonishing Wilson. \nSenate Republicans have shown leniency around their chamber's rule at other times. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, called McConnell a liar in 2015 without facing censure. Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nBe informed.
