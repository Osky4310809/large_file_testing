He added that the figures showed the extent of huge short-falls in personnel emolument of members of the union. \nHe expressed displeasure that despite federal government request for N10billion virement from National Assembly last year which was approved to address the short-falls of personnel emolument, academic staff of universities are yet to be paid the short-falls.
