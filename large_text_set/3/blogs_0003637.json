Here are seven actors who’ve been recognized by the Academy and also played a superhero! Mahershala Ali as Cottonmouth on Luke Cage \nOh hey, he just won an Oscar the other night! But before Mahershala Ali took home Best Supporting Actor for his role in Moonlight , he played the crooked Cottonmouth in the Netflix version of Luke Cage . You probably saw it it was like a month ago. Anthony Hopkins as Odin in Thor \nWhile Anthony Hopkins was intensely frightening as Hannibal Lecter, he brought a different, more personal, paternal level of intensity to his role as Odin to Thor. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts in Iron Man \nPepper Potts has been gone from the Marvel Universe for a little bit, but Gwyneth Paltrow helped give the Iron Man franchise the prestige it for some reason needed. Natalie Portman in Thor \nWhy is it that the girlfriends of these superheroes have such ridiculously impressive credits? Ben Affleck as Batman \nGranted, Ben Affleck wins Oscars for his behind-the-camera work and not his acting work, but that doesn’t mean he isn't spending a lot more time as Batman rather than creating the much-needed Argo 2: Now With Cars . Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor \nKevin Spacey. As Lex Luthor. The man has two Oscars under his belt, but neither of them were made of Kryptonite that would let him stop that accursed Superman. Alas! George Clooney as Batman \nSure he won an Oscar for Syriana , but did Syriana have rubber bat nipples? It did?! Then never mind I guess! \nAny other Oscar winners who've worn capes I should have included?
