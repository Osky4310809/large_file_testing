The downtime is expected to last until 5:30 a.m. Pacific Time at which point we should see the store return with Apple’s new iPad lineup and possibly new bands for the Apple Watch. \nApple usually launches new hardware products at media events, but this time around the company will be unveiling its new iPads without much fanfare. This is likely due to the new iPads featuring a minor refresh rather than coming with some major new technological breakthrough. \nPrevious rumors had indicated that Apple will be launching a new red color option for the iPhone 7 , a 128GB iPhone SE variant, and a new 10.5-inch bezel-less iPad along with the refresh to the existing models. A new color option for the iPhone 7 seems unlikely due to the recent lack of rumors surrounding it, while the 10.5-inch iPad was reportedly delayed due to some production issues. \nWhat are you expecting Apple to unveil today? Will you be buying a 10.5-inch bezel-less iPad if Apple unveils one today? Drop a comment and let us know! Like this post?
