We always appreciate reader suggestions. \nWe must take issue, however, with your warning: “Be advised, it will indeed break your heart.” At Open Culture we approach the arts with a discerning, engaged and unsentimental eye — our heart does not break, it blogs. \nIt will therefore take much more than an 8-minute cartoon, no matter how artfully rendered, understated, critically lauded, or Dutch, to move us. Please keep this in mind for the future. \nAll best, \nOpen Culture. \nP.S. OK, fine you win. This post was typed from the floor, drowning in the puddle we’d been reduced to by the 6 minute mark. And yes, bawling like babies. \nP.P.S. Per your suggestion, we’ve added it to our collection of Free Online Movies . Thanks again. \nSheerly Avni is a San Francisco-based arts and culture writer.
