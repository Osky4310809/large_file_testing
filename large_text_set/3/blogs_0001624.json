Lance Naik was found hanging from the ceiling of a barrack in Deolali Army Cantonment. He had talked to his wife, Finny on 25th of February, revealed John Mathew. According to an Indian Express report, John Mathew talkked to his wife about being worried because of the sting video uploaded by The Quint. He revealed that Naik was weeping and had told his wife that he has been called by the officials. \nThe video The Quint had uploaded was reportedly recorded without the Jawan’s consent. He had no knowledge that they were shooting while he spoke. The Jawan had talked about “Sahayak” or “buddy” system in the Indian Army. However, the video was removed from the website, police sources said Mathew talked about doing officers’ personal chores.

Police sources suspect that Naik committed suicide some days ago as the body was found in a decomposed state. DCP Shrikant Divare said that they have recovered a diary (in Malayalam) which the department is translating to get a clearer picture of the cause of death. The police also said that they are also investigating if it was the video which led to the death of the Jawan. \nThe Army however, took a different stand on the issue and issued a press release saying that the possible reason for the death of the Jawan could be his “guilt”. The press release said that they the guilt factor of “letting down his superiors or conveying false impression” could have driven the Jawan to death. \nMuch distressed family of Mathew said that the Army should have probed the matter instead of just marking him absent.
