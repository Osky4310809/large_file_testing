Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA grieving son was left outraged after staff at the sheltered accommodation where his father died accidentally left him an voicemail in which they claimed his father \"could have been a crack head for all they knew.\" \nBeloved grandfather Alfred Siddle was a resident at Ingleton House in Ingatestone, Essex, when he passed away aged 63 on October 16 last year. \nHis son, Alfie, 33, tried to get in touch with a member of staff there in the aftermath of his death, but was shocked when a different member of staff left him a voicemail by mistake, thinking she had hung up the phone. \n\"My dad passed away, so I turned up to the care home,\" Alfie told Essex News . \n\"As far as I was concerned the people working at a care home should be there 24/7 but they weren't. I found out that at this type of care home they live close to the place so they're on call which is half understandable. \n\"They were a bit rude and they left us in the lurch. A couple of days after everything, I went back to work. \n\"My dad had told me there was a lady there who had been helping him with things, so I was trying to get hold of her. \n\"I rang them up but couldn't get through. \n\"A couple of hours later I was in work and I got a phone call. I'm a lift engineer so I was up 50 feet in the air, so I couldn't get it. \n\"They left me a voicemail to say they'd call me back which was fine. That was for the first 10- 15 seconds. \n\"As far as she was concerned she had then put the phone down, but she hadn't.\" Read More Oldest World War II veteran, 110, faces losing home he built with bare hands due to spiralling care costs \nWhat Alfie, who lives in Poplar, heard next was shocking. \n\"The person I wanted to speak to was making out she wasn't available and got someone else to ring me but didn't realise they hadn't put the phone down so I could still hear them. \n\"As soon as that happened the nurse who had rang me spoke to the one I'd been trying to get hold of so she obviously was available. \n\"They started slagging my dad off, saying he could have been a crack head as far as they knew. \n\"They said they never helped him and knew nothing about him. But they could have at least knocked on his door and asked if he was OK. \n\"They were saying he could have been a crack head. They said he's fine running around the town centre. My dad couldn't walk. Well, he can walk but would do ten paces and would have to stop and would struggle breathing so I know that was a lie. \n\"I'd seen him a couple of days before and he was really bad. \n\"It's more to do with the way they spoke about my dad, about him being a crack head. And saying he could have been doing all sorts of drugs. \n\"They said he never wanted to associate with them. He was a proud East End man who didn't want help from people but still they could have knocked on his door. \n\"Then they went into something about another old man. They were saying 'it's the same as' this other guy.\" \nAlfie said the staff members then began talking about the other resident and said it was a similar situation.

It wasn't until I sent it to my partner I realised it was quite serious. \n\"What they've done is totally wrong. I was angry. My sister and half-sister were fuming.\" \nHis father, Alfred, died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

I knew straight away it was the lady I'd been trying to speak to,\" he carried on. \n\"I don't know whether she was in the room with her or on another line. But she was clearly available to speak. \n\"She obviously didn't want to speak to me. She did ring me up the next day and was pretty polite and nice but the voicemail had happened so I was trying to bite my tongue. \n\"I couldn't tell you what's going on with the investigation. The two nurses were suspended from work two days after we went to the council. That's all we've heard.\" \nA Brentwood Borough Council spokesperson said: \"Brentwood Borough Council can confirm it is undertaking an investigation following a complaint regarding Ingleton House in Ingatestone. \n\"The enquiry is currently ongoing and therefore Brentwood Borough Council is unable to comment further at this time.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:23:12.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
