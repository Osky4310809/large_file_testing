Led by former Sacramento Kings coach, Eric Musselman, the Wolf Pack earned the Mountain West Conference’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, defeating Colorado State on Saturday night, 79-71.\nNevada finished the season as the No. 1 seed and regular season champion in the Mountain West Conference with a 27-6 record overall, while going 14-4 in conference play.\nNevada is led by their big three in Cameron Oliver , Jordan Caroline and Marcus Marshall. Caroline, who is Simeon Rice’s son, led the game with 23 points and 10 rebounds. Oliver, an NBA prospect, finished with four points and 14 rebounds, and Marshall chipped in 21 points in the championship game.\nNevada came out strong and led by 12 at the half behind 16 points and seven rebounds from Jordan Caroline . Colorado State fought back from being down by as many as 16 points to tie the game at 51 with 11:25 to go in the second, but Nevada held on by finding ways to get to the free throw line late in the game.\nNevada will wait to learn their fate during Selection Sunday as to where they are headed for the NCAA tournament. They have a chance to make some noise in the tournament with such a dominant trio in Oliver, Caroline, and Marshall.\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T03:24:01.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
