According to the government, the movement of the mobile control tower was part of measures aimed at equipping the Kaduna airport for full flight services beginning from March 8 when the NAIA is eventually closed to airline activities. The Abuja airport will be closed for six weeks beginning from March 8, 2016 in order to allow engineers repair its runway and taxi ways. After an on-the-spot assessment of the Kaduna airport on Friday, the Minister of State for Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, directed the management of NAMA to move the mobile tower at the NAIA to Kaduna. He said, “The runway in Kaduna is in excellent condition, the lights and so on are okay. The terminals are at the final stage of being completed and I’m very convinced that within the next few weeks, before the due date, the terminal buildings will be ready. “However, if there is a force majeure that makes us unable to finish the ongoing terminal building, the other one being used for Hajj operations is adequate enough for passenger services.” He added, “Also, if we are not able to complete the tower, we will use the watch-tower being used now and which belongs to the fire service. And in an event of failure, we also have a mobile tower and can move the one in Abuja down here. “As a matter of fact, MD NAMA, you will move that tower from Abuja to this place and create space and set up your equipment. We are more than ready to accommodate the intended travelling public when they land at this facility.” On concerns by operators in the sector as touching the development, Sirika stated that all airlines, domestic and international, were in support of the plan and that they would fly to Kaduna during the six-week period. He said, “There was no threat by any international airline saying that they will not come to Kaduna. We told them that we were taking care of each and every item and that they would be invited to come and inspect the facility. “They are committed to Nigeria because this country is one of the best routes that they have and comparatively, it is the best place that they can do good business, going by the population we have.” Copyright PUNCH.
