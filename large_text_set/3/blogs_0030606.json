By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 27, 2017 7:30 AM Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is likely to visit Ayodhya on Monday. \nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is likely to visit Ayodhya on Monday. CM Adityanath’s visit will come against the backdrop of the Supreme Court recently asking parties involved to sit together and arrive at a consensus on the contentious issue of the construction of Ram Temple, which has been dragging on for decades. Adityanath himself has opined that aggrieved parties must sit together to resolve the matter. Terming the Supreme Court’s observation as a “solid” one, he had said, “It is a welcome step. The Narendra Modi government had welcomed the apex court’s suggestion, insisting that the parties to the case should keep in mind its “sensitivity”. The Opposition at the Centre Congress , however, has so far remained cautious in its response, saying there should be a “consensus-based” solution or the SC adjudicate the matter on merit. \nMahant Suresh Das of the Ayodhya-based Digambar Akhada had raked up the in the presence of Adityanath Yogi, saying the temple would be built on ‘Ram Janmabhoomi’ itself even as The Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) had claimed an out-of-court settlement of the Ayodhya dispute was not possible with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adityanath at the helm of affairs. \nPolitical slugfest has erupted on the issue. Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Pravin Togadia had asked the Centre to tread the path of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and enact a law to pave way to build Ram temple in Ayodhya. Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh state Minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary had announced establishing of a ‘Bhajan Sthal’ at Ayodhya with an investment of Rs 13.75 crore and in Chitrakoot with an investment of 14.67 crore. \nThe BMAC office bearers had proposed that if the Chief Justice of India or any other judge took an initiative to find a solution to the issue, the Muslims would certainly support the move. “We are ready if he (CJI) nominates a team for hearing the matter. But out-of-court settlement is not possible. If the SC passes an order in this regard, we will look at it,” BMAC Convenor Zafaryab Jilani had said on March 21, the day the apex court had observed that the matter was “sensitive and sentimental and it is best to settle it amicably.” \n(With agency inputs)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:03:56.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
