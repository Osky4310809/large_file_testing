The national math and education standards outlined in the Common Core are everywhere at Buck Elementary. Stapled packets of the standards hang outside classroom doors, and individual guidelines are cut out and displayed in the hallways next to hand-drawn graphs scribbled in crayon. A bill signed last Monday by Gov. Mike Pence makes Indiana the first state to revoke those standards, but what will replace them is unclear in a state where teachers are still reeling from years of change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T06:10:41.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
