The school and the parents work so hard to provide for the children in their care. \n“I have emailed the local inspector with my concerns as the rear of the school backs on to my garden. \n“It is a regular meeting place for some young people obviously up to no good, and I have asked for regular patrols. \n“I would also urge Denbighshire council to provide security cameras at the rear of the building to try to combat this anti-social behaviour.” \nPolice asked anyone with information to call 101, quoting reference number RC17001590.
