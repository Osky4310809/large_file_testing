(WJZ) — Police say a student brought a handgun to Perry Hall High School. Reigniting fear in a community that’s experienced gun tragedy before. \nAva-Joye Burnett reports on how police found out about the gun. \nPolice say the student brought the gun to school and was showing it around, but it was the actions of another student that alerted a school resource officer. \n“I think that was pretty brave because most people are scared about what other people would say, and whoever this person was stepped up to the plate and kept all of us safe, so he is a hero, he or she is a hero,” said student Erin Bethea. \nThis episode brought back back memories of what happened just a few years ago. \n“Just the panic of the day, just the panic of everything,” said parent Tracy Kraft. \nIn 2012 a 15 -year-old shot another student inside the cafeteria. The victim ended up in critical condition. \nThe teenage shooter pleaded guilty to attempted murder and got 35 years behind bars. \n“I lived out the shooting previously a few years ago with my oldest son. It just goes to show that there, something needs to be done within the school to prevent incidents like this from happening,” Kraft said. \nPolice say the student involved in Thursday’s incident did not point the gun at anyone but this show-and-tell will most likely result in charges. \n“The student had obtained the gun from a family member and the family was not aware that he had the weapon,” said Baltimore County Police Sgt. Andrea Bylen. \nNo one was injured Thursday and students who were initially shaken up are proving to be resilient. \n“It will feel a little different, just being more cautious about what’s happening around me and being on the look out, but I feel pretty protected.” \nWJZ has repeatedly contacted the school district for comment on this matter and they have not responded. \nIt is not clear what the specific charges against the student will be. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook Ava-joye Burnett Ava-joye Burnett joined WJZ Eyewitness News in January of 2016 as a general assignment reporter.
