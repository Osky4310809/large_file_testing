The devaluation of the naira and other unfriendly economic measures are taking a toll on the workers and Nigerians generally. \n“The usual excuse of no money because of the activities of the Niger Delta militants and fall in the price of oil does not subsist here. Our suggestion is: see to the demands of the Niger Delta militants, pass the petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, into law, diversify the economy, reduce cost of running government, jail looters of our treasury and there will be money to do much more than Nigerians are yearning for. We hope governments at all levels listen to the voice of reason.” \nSimilarly, NUTGTWN in a message by John Adaji and Issa Aremu, President and General Secretary of union, among others, called for the urgent review of the national minimum wage. \nAccording to the union, “The Federal Government should immediately constitute the Tripartite Committee for the review of the national minimum wage. The point cannot be overstated. The only way to reflate the economy is to increase the wages of workers. \n“Our experience shows that through dialogue and collective bargaining, a new national minimum wage in Nigeria is possible.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T07:49:21.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
