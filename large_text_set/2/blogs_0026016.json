While it didn't have the same bells and whistles we saw during yesterday's preshow press conferences , the first official day of the world's biggest showcase for mobile devices and technology still offered a few noteworthy products. \nHere are some of the most interesting things we saw: Sony wows with new Xperia phones Capture your world in super slow motion with Sony's new flagship XZ Premium and XZS If you want to shoot the best slow-motion footage of your friend falling off their skateboard, Sony's new handsets will be right up your street. by Andrew Hoyle Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF \nSony debuted the Xperia XZ Premium and XZS. Both phones are slightly updated versions of the Xperia XZ, which Sony released less than six months ago. While the camera resolution has dropped from 23-megapixels on the original XZ to 19-megapixels, the Premium and XZS have larger pixels for better low-light performance. Both phones can also shoot super slow-motion video, with the Premium capable of capturing video at an impressive 960 frames per second. \nThe XZS is equipped with a 5.2-inch full HD display, while the Premium packs an impressive 5.5-inch screen with a 3,840x2,160-pixel resolution. That calculates to a ridiculous pixel density of 801 pixels per inch. For comparison, the Google Pixel XL has a ppi of 534. Josh Miller/CNET \nSony also announced the budget-friendly Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra. Both phones feature midrange specs, but have thin bezels for a nearly edge-to-edge display. Meanwhile, one of the more interesting devices was the Xperia Touch. This Android-powered projector can transform a wall or surface into a 23-inch interactive screen (or larger, without the interactive capabilities).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:44:33.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
