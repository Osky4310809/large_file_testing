So what did he do on Thursday night? \nJumped off a taco truck into the arms of some American Outlaws to check “crowd jump” and “crowd surf” off his bucket list. \nDonovan was in San Jose, Calif., where he’ll call the United States’ World Cup qualifier against Honduras (coverage begins at 9:30 p.m. ET on FS1) so he stopped by the American Outlaws night-before party. \nThere, he got on top of a taco truck alongside Alexi Lalas and Rob Stone and gave a speech to the cheering U.S. fans, but you can’t just take the ladder off the truck. Not when you’re Landon Donovan.
