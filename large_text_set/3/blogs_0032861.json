Pedestrian deaths were up last year were up 22 percent over 2014.

The increase in smartphone use poses a huge distraction for both drivers and pedestrians. People behind the wheel are routinely text or browse social media on their phones, and people walk and look at their phones often with headphones on, making them oblivious to their surroundings. “ When it comes to cell phone use and smart phones and our constant need to connect, it’s also just as important to disconnect from time to time.” \n\"I think the fact that our frenzied pace of life and our frenzied need to stay in touch on our smart phones is certainly a contributing factor to a lot of these fatalities,\" said Kara Macek, Senior Director of Communications and Programs for GHSA. \nDelaware had the most pedestrian deaths per capita, followed by Florida, Arizona, South Carolina and New Mexico in 2016. New York City, the most heavily walked city in America, doesn't make the top ten. Experts believe that is because pedestrians are often part of large crowds, and heavy traffic tends to mean slower cars.

Lucas Jackson / Reuters, file \n\"We really think that distraction plays a huge part in the increase in traffic fatalities of every type, including those involving pedestrians,\" Macek said. \nTraffic engineers have been designing solutions in recent years that include medians to cut off J-walking routes, roundabouts that cause drivers to slow down, and speed bumps to slow cars in an attempt to cut down on accidents. \nBut the best advice for this growing problem, experts say, is to just put the phone down, even while walking. \n\"When it comes to cell phone use and smart phones and our constant need to connect, it's also just as important to disconnect from time to time,\" Macek said. \"And one of those times is when you're on the road.\" Amanda Golden", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:07:42.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
