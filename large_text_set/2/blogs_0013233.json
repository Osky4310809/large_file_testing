Wednesday evening, the singer let her more than 46 million Twitter followers know that her new song, It Ain't Me , is \"finally here!\" It's finally here! Listen to my new song #ItAintMe with @KygoMusic on @AppleMusic ! https://t.co/jBKYNmM4GY â€” Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) February 16, 2017 \nThough the collaboration with Norwegian music producer Kygo deals with a very taxing ex, the song's upbeat rhythm makes it great for dancing away a toxic relationship. \n\"Somewhere along the lines/We stopped seeing eye to eye/You were staying out all night/And I had enough,\" Gomez sings in the lyrics and continues, \"No, I don't wanna know where you been or where you're going/But I know I won't be home/And you'll be on your own.\" \nFor Jelena theorists, this might conjure up the image of Gomez's famous ex, Justin Bieber , whom she confirmed she was dating on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2011 after the two attended Vanity Fair's Oscar party that same year. \nYoung love at the 'Vanity Fair' Oscar Party on Feb. 27, 2011.

Featured on a song with Nav titled Some Way, the Starboy sings of taking another's woman. \n\"I think your girl, think your girl, fell in love with me,\" and \"I just took that chick, and I know you feelin' some way\" are a few of the lyrics he sings. \nThough not confirmed, the words have suspicious timing considering Bieber told TMZ in January that The Weeknd's music is \"wack.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lbBZ9l Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:25:10.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
