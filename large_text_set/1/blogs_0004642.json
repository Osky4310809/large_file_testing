Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThe “he said, she said” allegations being exchanged by the FBI and the Democratic National Committee continued Thursday, with the FBI insisting that the DNC would not allow direct access to its hacked servers, leaving the FBI to rely on a forensic analysis performed by a third party. \nBuzzFeed reported Wednesday that the DNC said the FBI “never requested access” to its servers and thus had never examined firsthand the computers that were allegedly penetrated by Russian hackers. BIG/weird scoop: The FBI has never examined the DNC computer servers it says were hacked by Russia: https://t.co/QjHVl9CA69 \n— Ali Watkins (@AliWatkins) January 4, 2017 DNC: FBI never examined our hacked servers https://t.co/bI6e7zhLUq pic.twitter.com/6DkENiDmQT \n— The Hill (@thehill) January 5, 2017 \nDNC deputy communications director Eric Walker told BuzzFeed in an email that the FBI never requested access to the DNC’s computer servers. Instead, the FBI relied on an analysis done by security firm CrowdStrike, which investigated the breach for the DNC. \nNBC’s intelligence and national security reporter added this information to the mix. Source close to the investigation says FBI didn't need the DNC servers because it already had the forensic data from upstream collection. \n— Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) January 5, 2017 \nOn Thursday, however, BuzzFeed’s Ali Watkins tweeted that the FBI claimed that it had requested direct access to the DNC’s servers, but the DNC refused, leaving the FBI no choice but to rely on third-party analysis. LATEST: FBI says they asked DNC for servers, and DNC refused, \"inhibited\" the investigation. pic.twitter.com/AfkAPlJsYZ \n— Ali Watkins (@AliWatkins) January 5, 2017 \nWatkins added that DNC “brushed off” Wednesday’s report in advance of the FBI’s statement with the caveat that having direct access to the servers wasn’t really “an important thing.” Seemingly in an effort to kill off the last of the DNC’s credibility, the DNC source added, “There are always haters out there.” Hours before FBI latest, DNC brushed off our story from yesterday. \"Insignificant\" that FBI didn't access to servers https://t.co/QmAKzMg8HC pic.twitter.com/JGK263XBJq \n— Ali Watkins (@AliWatkins) January 6, 2017 \nNow, Democrats seem more convinced than ever that FBI director James Comey, once a hero for recommending that Hillary Clinton not be indicted, really did try to derail her campaign in its final stretch. Either that, or the DNC really didn’t want whatever was on its servers exposed to the FBI. @AliWatkins This definitely sounds more likely than what the Dems claim. True to form! \n— Bot Tears Are Yummy (@AnthroGirl73) January 6, 2017 @AliWatkins That \"third party\" was the company that the DNC was paying, correct? \n— An Observer (@AnObserver3) January 6, 2017 @AliWatkins Shady! Glass house DNC didn't want their anti-Bernie shenanigans, hate speech, collusion with media, etc. viewed by FBI. \n— Naima Hazelton (@NaimaHazelton) January 5, 2017 @AliWatkins @GlomarResponder Gee, it's almost as if the DNC felt it had something to hide. \n— Bill Harvey's Ghost (@TheGhostsGhost) January 5, 2017 @AliWatkins @georgiotesta DNC has its story. FBI would learn the _truth_. Is it any wonder lib/Dems aren't cooperating? \n— Christopher G. Adamo (@CGAdamo) January 6, 2017 @AliWatkins They won't turn the server or the data over because it will contradict all the BS coming out of the DNC. \n— Lee Junn (@Lee_KGB_Junn) January 5, 2017 @AliWatkins Wonder what else DNC had to hide? No reason not to allow FBI access to the servers.
