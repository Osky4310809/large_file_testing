A total of 26,516 players from 69 countries voted for the FIFA FIFPro 11 - just 14 short of last year’s record amount of 26,530 votes. \nEach professional is entitled a vote through FIFPro's global network of player associations and the FIFA FIFPro 11 has been chosen annually since 2005. The final line-up is arranged in a 4-3-3 formation. \nLast year’s team was: Manuel Neuer; Dani Alves, Sergio Ramos, Thiago Silva, Marcelo; Paul Pogba, Luka Modric, Andres Iniesta; Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar.
