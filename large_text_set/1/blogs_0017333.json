As President Donald Trump took the oath of office this morning, WhiteHouse.gov underwent its customary makeover to reflect the agenda of the new Commander in Chief.\nThe new site has a few big omissions. There are no mentions of climate change or global warming, LGBT or civil rights, or healthcare.\n\nIt’s normal for Whitehouse.gov to change with a new president, but the exclusion and scrubbing of such major issues has caught the attention of activists and journalists.\nThe White House removed its climate change web page. And the healthcare, civil rights and LGBT sections. Just thought you should know.\n— George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) January 20, 2017 \nPresident Obama’s Whitehouse.gov included pages dedicated to LGBT civil rights and climate action — two issues he championed during his terms. Trump’s page is focused on issues like jobs, trade, military and law enforcement.\nPresident Obama’s climate change page before he left office.  \nTrump’s Whitehouse.gov also has pages dedicated to his America First foreign policy and energy programs.\nThe new site’s only reference to climate action reads:\nFor too long, we’ve been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years.\nAn archived version of President Obama’s Whitehouse.gov is still online here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T22:44:24.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
