That’s because Abercrombie & Fitch announced it’ll be closing 60 of its stores this year “through natural lease expirations,” during its fourth quarter earnings conference call on Thursday morning. Even though the brand is shuttering 60 brick-and-mortar stores, that doesn’t mean the teen favorite will be disappearing from other locations anytime soon. Abercrombie & Fitch also announced it plans to open six full-price stores and two new outlet stores, in the same dispatch . Never mind that the brand’s net sales dipped by 13 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, in comparison to the 2 percent decrease that affected their sibling brand, Hollister.

We continued to proactively respond to the evolving retail landscape through our store closure and channel optimization initiatives,” said Horowitz. “We also stayed close to our customers to understand what inspires them, which helped inform our planning and execution.” One way Abercrombie & Fitch has been working on moving forward is its spring 2017 collection . Inspired by early 2000s fashion—you know, the way A&F looked back in middle school—the collection exudes the preppy, all-American aesthetic that made the brand famous in the first place but with a streetwear twist. Abercrombie & Fitch isn’t the first mall staple to announce downsizing in 2017. Earlier this year, both The Limited and Wet Seal announced plans to shut down all of their brick-and-mortar stores, and last year, Aeropostale filed for bankruptcy .
