The Wanderers, having confirmed the release of Kerem Bulut, were left with only one striker — Lachlan Scott — for their game against Perth Glory on New Year’s Day, with Brendon Santalab serving a suspension. And Fox Sports’ commentator Dean Hefferan broke the news about Babalj’s arrival at the club, with the 24-year-old coming back from a torn ACL, suffered in January 2016. “After speaking to Wanderers staff before the game I can confirm Eli Babalj has arrived in the country to trial with the club this week,” Heffernan said during Fox Sports’ coverage of Western Sydney’s clash with Perth. media_camera Eli Babalj in action for Adelaide United last season. Photo Sarah Reed. “Eli did his ACL over a year ago and since then he’s cancelled his contract with AZ Alkmaar in Holland and in July he paid his own way through rehab in Belgium at one of the best clinics in Europe for seven months. “He’s obviously a very young, determined player and is a No.9 which is what the Wanderers are desperate for.” Babalj, capped twice for the Socceroos after making his breakthrough at Melbourne Heart, spent last season on loan at Adelaide United before injuring his knee. The news of Babalj’s trial follows reports of Wanderers’ interest in Brisbane Roar striker Jamie Maclaren, who has been linked with a marquee move.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T11:56:07.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
