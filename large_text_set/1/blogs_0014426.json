The groups are calling for immediate action on climate change, an end to extraction of fossil fuels, and protection of our lands, waters and children’s futures. Your last best chance: 29 reasons to join the Women's March on Washington Read more \nThe new administration’s stance on climate change is a threat to the entire world, but particularly to its women - as women work everyday to stop the devastation of communities and ecosystems; and as droughts, floods, extreme weather , infectious disease , and food and water insecurity disproportionately affect global women and the world’s 1.3 billion poor , the majority of whom are women. \nIt is important to highlight that violence against the Earth is directly linked to violence against women - and that patriarchy , colonization, imperialism and capitalism are all based in great part upon power over and exploitation of women , the land and peoples of color around the world. \nThese violent paradigms are manifested clearly in the current political landscape and threaten to escalate dangerously under the Trump administration, deepening multiple crises from accelerating climate change and environmental degradation, to detrimental social and economic injustices. \nWomen standing for climate justice across the US and around the world refuse to accept this future, and in this context, we march to declare that women are going to continue to rise ever more boldly in defense of all we hold dear - no matter what challenges we face in a climate denying administration . \nWe as women for climate justice march for full respect for climate science and immediate action on solutions to the global warming crisis – recognizing that it is a matter of life and death, and that justice on issues of economy, gender, race and immigration are completely interwoven with preventing the destruction of the planet for profit and power. Global warning: everything you wanted to know about climate change – live Read more \nWe march to send a message to the new administration that it is far past time to reject the rule of the fossil fuel industry, and that we must take immediate action to leave fossil fuels in the ground and transition to a clean, just, decentralized, democratized and sustainable energy future. \nTo do this, it is essential that frontline, grassroots, women of color and Indigenous women’s voices are at the forefront of the climate conversation, because they simultaneously bear the heaviest burden from environmental impacts, and work everyday to implement solutions born from necessity and to show that another world is possible . \nWomen from every sector of society are frequently the backbone of movements to stop pipelines ; preserve biodiversity ; grow sustainable economies ; feed the world ; implement clean energy solutions ; and challenge unjust economic, political and legal systems. \nThe Women’s March on Washington is part of a strengthened and expanded call to action , and a declaration of our intent to forge ahead for social and ecological justice because we know we must act now. \nAs you hear our strong voices in our nation’s capital and cities around the world on 21 January, know that women in the US and women of the world have a message to the new administration starting on day one: welcome to four years of audacious resistance and dauntless re-visioning. \nWomen will take uncompromising action to prevent harms to our families and communities, and build a healthy and just world for the Earth and all future generations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T17:27:16.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
