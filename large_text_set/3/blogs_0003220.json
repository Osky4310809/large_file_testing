You’ve got to go all the way to the end. This can’t be transferred. This is a personality following. They trust you. They don’t trust politicians.'” \nUltimately, Wead believes it was Trump’s rough persona that put him over the top, allowing him to overcome the odds and defeat Hillary Clinton. \n“That was the key to Trump, his brilliant branding. When you think of a brand…his brand was ‘Make America Great Again’ and the second part of his brand is ‘I’m not a politician.’ So, when he got off message, and people complained about that all the time, he was really on message because he was saying I’m not a politician, look at this dumb thing I’m saying. It kept the ball rolling. Yes, he’s going to make America great and no, he is not a politician, look what they’ve done to us.” Chris Stigall facebook Follow Weekdays: 5:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. Chris Stigall brings a contemporary brand of opinionated talk and humor to mornings on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT.
