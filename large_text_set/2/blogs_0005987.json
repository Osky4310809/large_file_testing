A boy sitting in his car booster seat (Photo: Getty) Read More Two family cars crashed in vivid demonstration of how far vehicle safety has come in 20 years \nThe rules, being brought in across Europe, will change how backless booster seats (booster cushions) are made. \nThe change doesn’t affect existing models of seats or cushions and doesn’t mean that they are unsafe or illegal. Children must be in an appropriate child car seat until they are either 135cm in height or 12 years old (Photo: Getty) \nBackless booster cushions available for sale will only be approved for children over 125cm or weighing more than 22kg and they will be clearly labelled as only suitable for children over that height and weight. \nA child car seat must: Conform to the United Nations standard, ECE Regulation 44.04 (or R 44.03) or to the new i-Size regulation, R129. Look for the 'E' mark label on the seat. Be suitable for your child's weight and size Be correctly fitted according to the manufacturer's instructions Be in a safe condition Boy in car back seat gazing out through window (Photo: Getty) \nMark Bennett, European Product Expert for Britax, said: \"The debate around children’s car seat safety is a perennial topic across Europe, so it isn’t surprising that there are positive updates to the regulations, especially when it comes to booster cushions. (Photo: BritaxUK/Youtube) \n\"Booster cushions do not offer head or side protection, which is vital for young children who are still developing and more susceptible to trauma in the event of an accident. \nBritax fully endorses more stringent ruling when it comes to booster cushions – so much so, in fact, that we have been urging parents to ‘bin the booster’ for the past few years. \n\"To ensure a child in this size and weight category is protected and safe in transit, the most effective and safe method is to use a highback booster. \n\"We recommend parents look for highback booster seats with deep protective side wings, head support and seat belt guides to ensure the best protection for their children.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T16:21:46.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
