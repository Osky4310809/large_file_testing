As to what she is holding over his head, though, that remains to be seen. Regardless of why he's acting like this, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) isn't giving up on him, and he seemingly rewards that faith by trailer's end. \nYou can view the new trailer in the video above. The official synopsis can be found below. \nNow that Dom and Letty are on their honeymoon and Brian and Mia have retired from the game—and the rest of the crew has been exonerated—the globetrotting team has found a semblance of a normal life. But when a mysterious woman (Oscar® winner Charlize Theron) seduces Dom into the world of crime he can’t seem to escape and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before. \nFrom the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, our elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the world’s stage…and to bring home the man who made them a family.” \nFor The Fate of the Furious , Vin Diesel is joined by a returning all-star cast that includes Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Elsa Pataky and Kurt Russell. In addition to Theron, the series welcomes newcomers Scott Eastwood and Oscar winner Helen Mirren. The film is directed by F. Gary Gray (Straight Outta Compton) and produced by returning producers Neal H. Moritz, Michael Fottrell, and Diesel. \nThe Fate of the Furious opens in theaters April 14, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:49:42.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
