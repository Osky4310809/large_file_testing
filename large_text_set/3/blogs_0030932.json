Asked at a press conference whether he should step down, Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress, responded simply: “No.” \nWith the Republicans united in defense of the inquiry, chances are diminishing for its work to be accepted as definitive. The Republicans are also blocking the establishment of an independent commission into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. \nDoubts over Nunes sharply escalated after the California Republican canceled a public hearing originally planned for Tuesday during which two senior intelligence officials appointed by Barack Obama, and the former acting attorney general Sally Yates, were scheduled to testify. \nYates, whom Trump fired after she refused to defend his travel ban in court, was reportedly told by the Trump administration that her testimony was subject to constraint. The Washington Post published letters from Yates’ attorney indicating the justice department informed her that “all information Ms Yates received or actions she took” while a senior department official represented “client confidences that she may not disclose absent written consent of the Department”. \nThe justice department’s client is the United States, not the president. \nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, disputed the story, calling it “entirely false.” \n“The White House has taken no action to prevent Sally Yates from testifying and the Department of Justice specifically told her that it would not stop her, and to suggest otherwise is completely irresponsible,” Spicer said. \nIt was the latest controversy shadowing Nunes. Mystery deepens over Nunes’ investigation into Trump staff and Russia \nLast week, following a public hearing that undermined Trump’s evidence-free claim Obama put him under surveillance, Nunes said he was “alarmed” to learn of documents indicating Trump allies had their communications incidentally collected as part of “lawful” surveillance. He did not disclose until Monday that he received those documents not in the committee’s secured workspaces for viewing classified material, but at the White House complex. \nNone of this was shared with the committee, though Nunes informed the White House and the press first. \nWhile Nunes has not disclosed his source, much speculation has centered on Michael Ellis , a former committee staffer who now works in the White House counsel’s office. \nAdam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called on Nunes to recuse himself late Monday. On Tuesday, Schiff lamented the cancellation of the open hearing and, without confirming that the administration had sought to scotch Yates’ testimony, urged Nunes to permit Yates to testify publicly. \nSchiff also indicated that Yates would be asked to expand on the conversations with the Russian ambassador that prompted the dismissal of Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. \n“We would urge that the open hearing be rescheduled without further delay and that Ms Yates be permitted to testify freely and openly so that the public may understand, among other matters, when the president was informed that his national security adviser had misled the vice-president and through him, the country, and why the president waited as long as he did to fire Mr Flynn,” Schiff said.
