The character, clad entirely in gold, and surrounded by more people with golden skin, merely exists in the spot to ask who the hell the Guardians are , leading to their reintroduction to the world in the remaining 57 seconds or so. \nBut looking at the character's comic book past, ComicBook.com noted that she's also referred to in the pages of Marvel Comics as \"Her,\" the counterpart to \"Him,\" better known as Adam Warlock. Adam Warlock is a stalwart in the Marvel Cosmic world, with a major role to play in the Infinity Saga, and is typically in possession of the Soul Stone, the final remaining Infinity Stone in the MCU. Intriguing, yes, and writer/director James Gunn says Ayesha's introduction could lead to Warlock's. \n\"[It's] totally possible\" that Ayesha and Adam Warlock are related in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Gunn told reporters at a set visit last spring. \"They're created in pods.\" \nThe \"they\" in this instance isn't just Ayesha and possibly Warlock, but the race that Ayesha belongs to in the MCU. \n\"She's a member of this race called the Sovereign, and they're all genetically created by themselves as a self-sustaining race who are perfect,\" Gunn explained. The Sovereign will act as the main antagonists in the film, and seem to take their cues from a few different races and organizations in the comics. \nThere has been much speculation about whether we'll see the final Infinity Stone, Soul, in Guardians Vol. 2 , Thor: Ragnarok , or Black Panther , and even a possible link between Her and Him in the MCU certainly opens that question wide open. We have to see it sometime between now and the end of Avengers: Infinity War in May 2018, and if Warlock can come with it, a lot of Marvel Cosmic fans will be happy. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is written and directed by James Gunn (Slither). The film marks the return of the original Guardians, including Chris Pratt (Jurassic World) as Peter Quill/Star-Lord; Zoe Saldana (Star Trek Into Darkness) as Gamora; Dave Bautista (Spectre) as Drax; Vin Diesel (Furious 7) as the voice of Groot; Bradley Cooper (American Sniper) as the voice of Rocket; Michael Rooker (Jumper) as Yondu; Karen Gillan (The Big Short) as Nebula; and Sean Gunn (Gilmore Girls) as Kraglin. New cast members include Pom Klementieff (Oldboy), Elizabeth Debicki (The Great Gatsby, Everest), Chris Sullivan (The Knick, The Drop) and Kurt Russell (The Hateful Eight, The Thing). \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is scheduled to hit theaters on May 5, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T20:14:53.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
