(Photo: Screenshot via YouTube/WarnerBros.) It’s rare that a remake of a horror classic actually looks decent. They’re usually pointless, shallow and often forget what made the original so scary, to begin with. (Looking at you, 2015 version of Poltergeist .) The trailer for the upcoming It remake came out today, and things are looking great. Even if you have remake fatigue at this point (understandable), this trailer has one important thing going for it: It’s scary. Maybe having a clown antagonist is cheating a little, but hey. It’s effective.\nI like that it starts out with a little bit of comedy. You can’t deny it’s a little funny how the kid hits his head on the roadblock. And it’s the second roadblock. What, somehow he dodged the first, but ran right into the second? Introducing the town of Derry, Maine with that little bit of slapstick was a smart move. It gets you to let your guard down right before Pennywise appears in the gutter. That’s how you pull off a good jump scare. I also like how the trailer is focusing on the Losers Club as kids, rather than when they come back to deal with the monster as adults. It gives the whole thing a nostalgic Stranger Things vibe that I’m completely on board with.\nThere are a couple of things that give this movie an edge over other horror remakes. First, it’s not technically a remake. The It that terrified all of us as children was a TV movie, making this one the first feature film based on Stephen King’s novel. Second, the original wasn’t that good. Being one of the first horror movies many of us saw as kids (and possibly also because it stars a baby Seth Green), many of us in our late 20s/early 30s have fond memories of It . Those memories might be fonder than the TV movie really deserved. Go back and watch it now, it doesn’t hold up. It’s cheesy, low-budget, and not all that scary. The ending, where It’s true form is revealed is particularly disappointing.\nThe only thing the original had going for it was Tim Curry. That’s one thing this remake sadly won’t have. Tim Curry’s scenery chewing performance played up the comedy as well as the horror in the original. His ability to make us laugh made that version of Pennywise even more terrifying. It’s why he remains such a memorable horror villain today. There doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of comedy in this version of Pennywise. We don’t even hear him speak in the trailer. So far, that seems to be working fine. He doesn’t have to speak. That smile is scary enough. Now that we can see what Pennywise is capable of, I’m much more confident in this movie’s ability to give us a scary villain. It works a lot better than that awkward still the studio released a while back.\n\nSeriously, this was the first image of the movie they wanted to show off? How could they not have expected the internet to meme it to death? It looks like he’s about to close out a Looney Tunes short. I’m surprised they didn’t include a version with a sad Keanu Reeves sitting on the bottom of that sewer pipe. The trailer doesn’t include this image. Instead, Pennywise haunts a slide projector in a brief sequence that’s way scarier than it has any right to be. Also, that single-frame clown face at the end is NOT cool, trailer. Not. Cool.\nIt arrives in theaters, then follows you home to live under your bed on September 8, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:16:17.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
