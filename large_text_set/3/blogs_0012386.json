However, the inquiries were closed for lack of evidence. By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 15, 2017 11:47 AM Former minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati. (Source: IE) \nGayatri Prajapati is the same man whom Prime Minister, Narendra Modi mentioned again and again during his campaign trail. He talked about him as a living example of the breakdown of law and order in Uttar Pradesh. The next day, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav did not share the dais with him — and the UP Minister broke down while protesting allegations of rape. Who is this politician against whom the Supreme Court has ordered action, and what is the case against him? \n1. Prajapati is a first-time MLA who defeated the Congress ’s Ameeta Sinh, a local heavyweight, at the Amethi seat, which is part of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi ’s Lok Sabha constituency of the same name. The victory in the 2012 elections was followed by a meteoric rise for Prajapati, who comes from a poor family but grew in local politics after becoming a contractor. \n2. In February 2013, Prajapati was inducted into Akhilesh Yadav’s ministry as Minister of State for Irrigation and, in July, given independent charge of mining. In January 2014, he was promoted to Cabinet Minister as the SP tried to reach out to the backward Kumhar caste which has good numbers across the state but remains under-represented in politics. \nAlso Watch: \n3. In July 2015, an IG-rank IPS officer named Amitabh Thakur sought the filing of an FIR against Mulayam, alleging that he had been threatened by the then SP chief over the phone. Thakur claimed Mulayam was angry because his activist wife, Nutan Thakur, had launched a campaign against Prajapati. \n4. Three complaints were filed with the state Lokayukta against Prajapati in 2015, accusing him of amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income and sheltering illegal mining in the state. However, the inquiries were closed for lack of evidence. \n5. In September 2016, a few weeks after Allahabad High Court asked the CBI for a report on whether illegal mining was being carried out in the state with the collusion of authorities, Akhilesh sacked Prajapati from the Cabinet. He was, however, re-inducted soon afterward, as it became clear that the sacking was the fallout of the feud in the SP’s first family, and that Mulayam was in favour of Prajapati’s return. \n6. A woman from Bundelkhand has alleged that Prajapati, along with his associates Ashok Tiwari, Pintu Singh, Vikas Verma, Chandrapal, Rupesh and Ashish Shukla raped her at Prajapati’s official residence at 5, Gautampalli in Lucknow in 2014. In her complaint to police, the woman said Ashok Tiwari had asked her to come to Prajapati’s residence where the minister had asked her to work in sand mining. “He told me that he will allot one block in Hamirpur to me before mixing some intoxicating substance in my tea,” the woman said in the FIR, alleging that she was gang raped after she fell unconscious. \nAccording to the woman, the Minister and his associates used pictures of the gangrape to blackmail her, forcing her to visit another of Prajapati’s homes on Park Road, where she was allegedly sexually assaulted for months.
