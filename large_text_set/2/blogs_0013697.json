People reports that her sons Maddox (who is from Cambodia) and Pax were involved in the production of the film—from reading scripts and attending the production meetings. \nThe film is about the autobiography of Cambodian human-rights activist Loung Ung. It tells the story of the Khmer Rouge communist party back in the ’70s who nearly wiped out a quarter of Cambodia’s population. “It’s the story of war through the eyes of a child, but it is also a story of a country,” said Angelina Jolie in the film feature. \nThe film was premiered at the Terrace of the Elephant in Angkor Wat, in the presence of the country’s King Norodom Sihamoni and Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk, and other government officials. \nAngelina was very thankful for the honor of telling the story and couldn’t help but share her love and connection with the country. “Most of all, this film is my way of saying thank you to Cambodia,” she said. “Without Cambodia I may never have become a mother. Part of my heart is and will always be in this country. And part of this country is always with me: Maddox.” \nMaddox also spoke during the premiere, “Thank you everyone for attending tonight. We finally made it. It’s a great honor to present this film to all of you, and to stand by my mother and my family.” At the end of his speech, his sister Shiloah spoke in the local language Khmer and said, “My name is Shiloah and I love Cambodia.” \nThis is the first appearance of Angelina and her kids since she filed for divorce from Brad Pitt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:16:31.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
