Getty Images 13 Gianluigi Buffon will go head-to-had in legendary Champions League clash \nBuffon has been playing first team football since 1995, when he made his Serie A debut for Parma at the age of 17. \nWhile Casillas was named on the Real Madrid bench aged 16 in 1997 and made his debut two years later. \nFor almost 20 years, the pair have competed for the title of the world’s best goalkeeper. \nAnd from 2006 to 2012, they officially were. \nBuffon held the mantle in 2006 and 2007, with Casillas taking over for the subsequent five seasons before age and the emergence of Manuel Neuer took over. Getty Images Gianluigi Buffon made his debut for Parma way back in 1995 and is still going Getty Images 13 Iker Casillas was the youngest goalkeeper to start at Champions League final at 19 \nThe Italian icon, who is three years the Spaniard’s senior, was the first to taste Champions League action — making his debut at Sparta Prague with Parma and kept a clean sheet. \nIt was a time when only the best runners-up qualified from the group and Serie A side finished behind Borussia Dortmund to fall at the first hurdle. \nThough, Buffon did keep a clean sheet in a 1-0 victory over the German defending champions. \nIn the summer of 2001, Juventus made him the world’s most expensive goalkeeper when they signed him for £32million. What Iker Casillas said about Gianluigi Buffon \n“Gigi is a great person — a role model for all of us. For the footballing world he is already a legend, and it’s great he continues to play. For me, it was great growing up and developing my skills alongside such a great goalkeeper. He started his career very early. He’s actually three years older than me, but he was successful very quickly and, for eight or nine years, he has been one of the best three, or let’s say five, goalkeepers in the world. The other top keepers always change, but he is always among the best.” \nHowever, despite making over 100 appearances in the competition, he is yet to taste success — with two final defeats. \nIn 2003, Juventus were beaten on penalties by AC Milan after a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford. \nAnd 12 years later, Barcelona won 3-1 in Berlin to complete a remarkable Treble — and prevented the Bianconeri doing so. \nBuffon’s not done too badly, though.
