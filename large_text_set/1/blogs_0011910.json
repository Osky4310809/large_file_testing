Many people in the west believe that we would never see anything like that happen in North America but some researchers with a rather unique point of view think otherwise. \nMarco Lagi and colleagues at the New England Complex Systems Institute in Cambridge believe that they have found a single factor that could possibly spark mass worldwide riots. \nThe price of food. \nWhile it isn’t the price of food itself that will lead to riots Lagi and team say that what the high prices do is create the conditions in which social unrest can grow. \nThe evidence comes from two sources. The first is data gathered by the United Nations that plots the price of food against time, the so-called food price index of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN. The second is the date of riots around the world, whatever their cause. Both these sources are plotted on the same graph above. \nThis clearly seems to show that when the food price index rises above a certain threshold, the result is trouble around the world. \nThis isn’t rocket science. It stands to reason that people become desperate when food is unobtainable. It’s often said that any society is three square meals from anarchy. \nvia Technology Review \nBack in December of last year Lagi and his group wrote to the U.S. Government warning that global food prices were about to cross over the threshold that had been identified by the group. Then four days later the Arab Spring was sparked into life by the death of Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian who set himself on fire to protest government policies. What has followed is as they say – history. \nLagi and his group are suggesting that once again in August 2013 we could cross that danger threshold once again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:44:14.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
