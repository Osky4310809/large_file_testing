The actor went on a rampage, yesterday, sending abusive DMs to women and blocking one troll after the other. Sure, the actor isn’t exactly known for his political correctness but this abusive behaviour has ticked off the Twitterati (and Arnab Gosawami). \nChintu ji , however, isn’t yet ready to call it quits on his online rage. In an interview to Pinkvilla, he was clear on his intentions: \n“Yes, I don’t deny those accusations. You don’t mess with me. I am not amongst those to allow such bullshit. You bloody don’t like me? Unfollow me. But you try and mess with me, I will hit you below the belt and screw you. Main Pagal toh nahi hoon ki unnecessarily kisiko bhi abuse karunga ? Kuch toh kia hoga na aapne ?” \nIn no mood to back down, he added, “These buggers deserve this. I am a daring bugger, if you mess with me I will not leave you. I have decided to not do it openly but if they write shit to me, I abuse them via DM and block them” \nYep, this is not going to end well.
