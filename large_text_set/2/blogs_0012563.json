Vidyasagar Rao on Thursday morning invited AIADMK legislature party leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami to meet him around noon. According to a source, Mr. Palaniswami might be invited to form the government. \nThe source said that the Governor was \"more receptive\" to their demands on Wednesday night when both the camps went to Raj Bhavan. The updates: \n11.35 a.m. AIADMK legislature party leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami has arrived at Raj Bhavan to meet Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao. \n10.56 a.m.: Mr. Palaniswami has left Golden Bay Resorts in Kuvathur with four Ministers, including S.P. Velumani and P. Thangamani. \n10.40 a.m.: Here's a round-up of the developments on Wednesday. \nThe two camps — one led by Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and the other by Mr. Palaniswami — met the Governor late night. “The meeting lasted for about 25 minutes. We told the Governor that it was a clear case of majority, and Mr. Palaniswami should be invited to form the government,” said a party senior, who was at the meeting. \n“We also told him that Mr. Palaniswami was also popular and known among the people in the State. We asked him to render justice. The Governor did not say anything. He treated us with respect and listened to us,” he said. \nSpeaking to reporters outside the Raj Bhavan, Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said, “We informed the Governor that Mr. Palaniswami has been nominated unanimously by the party MLAs. We have confidence that he will uphold democracy. He informed us that he will consider our views.” \n“We have 124 MLAs. They [Mr. Panneerselvam’s camp] have only 8 MLAs. Is 8 big or is 124? Think about it,” Mr. Jayakumar said.
