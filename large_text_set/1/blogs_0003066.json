A disabled man was bound, gagged, beaten, and cut on Tuesday while suspects berated him with “F- Trump!” and “F- white people!” Mr. Lemon told guests that the crimes, which were uploaded to Facebook, had nothing to do with “evil.” \n“I don’t think it’s evil,” Mr. Lemon responded to contributor Matt Lewis. “I think these are young people, and I think they have bad home training. Who’s raising these young people? I have no idea who’s raising these young people, because no one I know on earth who is 17 years old or 70 years old would ever think of treating another person like that. It is inhumane.” \nSEE ALSO: Chicago police charge 4 black suspects of hate crime after ‘F- Trump’ torture video \nAll of the individuals charged by police are legally adults. Suspects Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper, and Brittany Covington are 18 years old; Tanishia Covington is 24. \nCharges leveled against the group include aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary. \nAuthorities said the victim is recovering in a local hospital. \nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Thursday that it was “too early to say” whether federal hate crime charges are warranted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:37:14.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
