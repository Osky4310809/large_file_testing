Do you love boxing? I do watch the sport sometimes but not all the time. What about you? \nAnyway, we asked because of the weigh-in video of the boxers above that is making the rounds in the Internet. It’s the weigh-in for the David Allen – David Howe heavyweight fight this weekend and the invisible viewers in the video could be overheard cracking up because of Allen’s impressive package. The emcee could be heard commenting: “It’s all real, ladies and gentlemen.” \nHis opponent, David Howe, playfully went with the mood by feigned groping Allen audience be damned—an action that got the crowd to laugh even harder. If you ask me he must have heard everybody else’s thoughts, seriously. You da man, Howe! You da man! \nBetween the two of them, who would you root for: the boxer on the right side or the one on the left? We’ll let you be the judge. Take a look at their entertaining weigh-in below. \nSo, what do you think? David Allen won the fight, by the way, showing everyone else he wasn’t nicknamed “White Rhino” for nothing. \nHappy viewing!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T03:53:24.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
