They saw some questionable things about Russians, about his businesses in Russia. They, in turn, hired this MI-6 former investigator. He then came up with additional information from his Russian sources. He was very concerned by the implications of it.” \nBuzzfeed published what is purported to be the full dossier detailing the explosive — but unverified — claims that Russia had been “cultivating, supporting and assisting” Trump for years and held compromising information about him. \nThe documents published by Buzzfeed claim said the Russians had exploited “Trump’s personal obsessions and sexual perversion in order to obtain suitable ‘kompromat’ (compromising material) on him.” \nSome of the claims have circulated for months, and Mother Jones reported on some of them in late October. \nTop intelligence officials said they revealed those findings to Trump to make sure he was aware those allegations were circulating. \nThey also wanted to demonstrate to Trump that Russia had gathered damaging information about both him and Hillary Clinton — but chose only to harm the Democratic candidate’s campaign. \nTrump and Obama were also told by intelligence officials that Trump’s surrogates continually exchanged information with intermediaries from the Russian government during the campaign. \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 10, 2017 \nTravis Gettys is an editor for Raw Story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T18:56:05.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
