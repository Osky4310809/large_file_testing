Which kind of unity do you expect?? synariob \nSo punch you have allowed this inciting comment to pass and we are still talking to leave together as Nigerîan akara \nlolxx.. You no know that one before?? Besides is it not obvious that he is impersonating a northerner.. Femi Pedro \nI bet it’s one of Jonathan’s blogger. Nostory \nNo way for Jonathan & his rebellious people (SS/SE) in 2015. The power is definitely moving back to the North in 2015 by all means( Civilian or military) Victor \n” civilian or military” you’re indeed a cow…. Anthony Okpunwa \nGEJ till 2019 Victor \nIt is obvious that you’re an illiterate. Check your use of words and spellings. Please stop disgracing Nigerians on the Internet because the whole world can access this your write up. “We have killed them finish, if the try us, all thier land” please go back to school and stop thinking of killing…..cow. Lekan Lawoyin \nThat doesn’t sound like someone who has anything upstairs! Ahiara John \nMallam Musa Aliyu has commented and he is back to tuwo. I have read through those sentences of him and discovered that he is not only a Mallam but a he donkey. OSCAR \nWHAT DID THE COMMON NORTHERNERS GAIN FROM THE OVER FORTY YEARS OF NORTHERN RULE IN NIGERIA? GEJ IS PRESENTLY TRYING TO REVIVE AGRICULTURE, RAILWAYS, DRY SEASON FARMING, POWER ETC. THESE ARE THE THINGS THE NORTH NEED TO GROW AND REGAIN IT’S PLACE IN THE COMMITTEE OF NATIONS. NORTHERNERS SHOULD STOP RELYING ON HANDOUTS FROM THE CABAL THAT HAS HIJACK AND STOLEN THE WEALTH OF THE NATION OVER THE YEARS. THE NORTH AMIDST OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS IN NIGERIA TODAY HAS THE BIGGEST REPRESENTATION AND MOST JUICY APPOINTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT. VIRTUALLY ALL THE INDIGENOUS OIL PRODUCING COMPANIES AND SERVICE COMPANIES (LOCAL & MULTINATIONALS) ARE OWNED BY FEW SELECTED NORTHERNERS. YET, THESE HAVE NOT TRANSFORM TO FOOD ON THE TABLE OF THE COMMON NORTHERNERS OR NIGERIAN. TO CUT MY STORY SHORT, LET US VOTE FOR A NIGERIAN THAT WILL DELIVER IRRESPECTIVE OF ETHNICITY. GEJ SEEMS TO BE ADDRESSING THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES, LET GIVE HIM A CHANCE. Bolaji Sanusi \nI think u should have ur head examine DIKE \nAh, dis one na Boko haram oo.. Frisky2good \nMai auka, if not for stupidity you will realize that a northerner being there will only spell more doom for ur folks. We know the Yorubas for turning their education to success. Igbos Turn their business skills to success. What of you guys? Ba sense, ba skill yet you say boko is haram. Your folks own most of the oil wells in Nigeria, yet your tribe accounts for 90% of the beggars in Nigeria. Haba mallam, shame no dey catch una? Udechukwu Nnaji \nPunch, you people should vet comments before you publish them. This comment is a stupid comment and has no reason to be published at all. Femi Pedro \nEveryone know you are not a northerner as they are not into frivolity like this claptrap. I bet it’s one of Jonathan’s blogger. I wonder how low these people will stoop. NaijaMindOfChange \nHope you were able to tell IBB that you are sorry that PDP as a party have collapsed and there is now a change. APC is showing Nigerians what true democracy is all about. hudson \nLike the autocracy and no internal democracy going on Ekiti State? Is that the trus democracy Abeg make you open eye, open mind according to Baba Fela of blessed memory the man was saw Nigerian tomorrow years ago and he was called names Igbo smoker and all the names like you people are calling Jonathan today, God please baba help us open the eyes and mind of Nigerian youths for they are the only problem of the country Nigeria, Mumuish fellowship, ethnic/religious begot as planted by the greedy politicians akara \nlolxxx.
