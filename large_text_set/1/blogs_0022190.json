Codenamed the Nokia Heart, the upcoming phone has been spotted on GFXBench benchmarking website. The benchmarks have revealed quite a few specs of the Nokia Heart, which suggest it will be a budget offering. \nAs per GFXBench , the Nokia Heart will carry a 5.2-inch display bearing a resolution of 1,280 x 720 pixels. It will utilise a 1.4GHz octa-core Qualcomm processor, mated to an Adreno 505 GPU and 2GB of RAM. The Nokia 6 is fuelled by a Snapdragon 430 SoC, so we expect the Nokia Heart to be powered by the same chipset. \nThe source further reveals that the Nokia Heart will come with 16GB of internal memory, out of which only 9GB will be available to the users. The phone will feature a 12-megapixel primary camera and an 8-megapixel secondary shooter. The device will boot Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. It will be a single-SIM smartphone with NFC support. \nThe Nokia 6 is available in China for around Rs 17,000. The Nokia Heart, on the other hand, is expected to retail around Rs 12,000. HMD Global will be present at the upcoming MWC in the next month. The brand is expected to unveil a couple of new Android devices at the event, and the Nokia Heart could be one of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:13:09.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
