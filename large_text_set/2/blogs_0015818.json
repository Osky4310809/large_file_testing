Stamping rock grooves and staccato hooks would stop dead for softly inquisitive sax speculations before expat American drummer/leader Mark Holub kicked the group toward boiling melees. Spooky synth bleeps were embraced by breathy slow figures from Pete Grogan and Chris Williams’s alto saxes, warm horn harmonies unfolded over electronic chugging like distant steam-trains, and virtuosic bass guitarist Liran Donin’s old-school rock-bass twangs, flamenco-like strumming, and precisely looping countermelodies were a constant spur. The sax players were sometimes tentative despite the intensity of the undertow in the first half, but blossomed in the second – notably in Grogan’s delicate handling of two hauntingly folksy episodes, Williams’s Ornette Colemanesque zigzags, Holub’s melodic cymbal flutters against the attentive Toby McLaren’s diaphanous synth chords, and a free-jazz clamour that acquired a highlife bounce in the encore. \nThe jump-cutting bordered on the disorientating at times, but Led Bib have certainly come back with a bang – or more accurately, a machine-gun barrage of bangs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:07:15.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
