Gary Neville has his say...   4:14pm Gary Neville gives his verdict on whether mid-season manager sacking should be banned Should mid-season manager sackings be banned? Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville said he would support the idea that managers could not be sacked during a campaign. \nIn a week where Aitor Karanka lost his job at Middlesbrough , Martin Tyler, who was co-commentating on Man City's draw with Liverpool alongside Neville, asked the former Manchester United defender whether a transfer window for managers should be introduced. Aitor Karanka lost his job at Middlesbrough last week \nSwansea, Crystal Palace, Hull and Leicester have all changed their managers and have seen an upturn in fortunes, while Arsene Wenger is under increasing pressure from Arsenal supporters after a number of poor results, but Neville wouldn't be against stopping teams chopping and changing during the season in the future. Listen to Gary Neville's verdict on Man City's 1-1 draw with Liverpool \n\"When you set off at the start of the season with a manager then he has to be your manager for the entire season. Football would support it, in terms of the professional side - I'm not sure whether the owners would. \n\"But it would mean the players would know you're going to be the manager until the end of the season, they'd have to get on with it.\" Hull City manager Marco Silva replaced Mike Phelan at Hull \nNearly all of the sides that have changed managers this season have enjoyed a turnaround in fortunes under their new regimes, and according to Neville, those success stories give other owners the confidence to keep changing managers. Craig Shakespeare is in charge at Leicester following Claudio Ranieri's exit \n\"Teams are making changes at the bottom of the league and I'm almost sitting there thinking 'I wish this doesn't work' because when it does, it gives others the confidence to change their manager,\" he added. \n\"There have been examples where it's worked when managers are sacked and where it hasn't. I'm not sure there is a distinction between either. It seems to be more the done thing where you do sack the manager at the earliest point as the players respond. Paul Clement's arrival saw an upturn in Swansea's fortunes \n\"We've seen that at Leicester - what an incredible bounce they've had. It's happened at Swansea and Hull.\" \nShould mid-season manager sackings be banned? You've heard Gary Neville's view, now tell us what you think!
