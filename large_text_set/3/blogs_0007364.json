Mike Garafolo of NFL .com reported the deal was for three years, with Garcon expected to earn $23 million over the first two years of the deal and a $12 million signing bonus. Garcon recently finished the final season of the five-year, $42.5 million deal he signed with the Washington Redskins prior to the 2012 campaign, according to Spotrac.com . In 2016, Garcon produced to the tune of 79 receptions for 1,041 yards and three touchdowns as part of a three-headed wideout group with DeSean Jackson and Jamison Crowder. After enjoying a career year in 2013 by leading the NFL with 113 receptions and racking up 1,346 yards to go along with five touchdowns, Garcon's statistical output came back down to earth in 2014 and 2015. The 30-year-old veteran averaged 70 grabs for 764 yards and four touchdowns between those two seasons, which led to speculation that the 2016 campaign could be his final one with the Redskins. Those whispers grew even louder when Washington selected TCU wideout Josh Doctson in the first round of the 2016 NFL draft. While Doctson saw little action in 2016, his presence along with the progression of Crowder and the threat of Jordan Reed at tight end likely contributed to Garcon being viewed as expendable. When Garcon broke into the league as a sixth-round pick of the Indianapolis Colts out of Mount Union, he was looked at as a game-breaker capable of making big plays down the field. Garcon is still able to do that in certain situations, but with a yards-per-catch average of less than 12.0 in each of the 2013, 2014 and 2015 seasons before rebounding to 13.2 in 2016, it is clear that he has developed into a more polished route-runner rather than a receiver who constantly goes for the home run. After competing for targets in Washington, Garcon has a chance to become more of a featured part of the offense with his new team, which is something that hasn't necessarily been the case since 2013. Although Garcon isn't likely to put up gaudy statistics, he finds ways to get open and also contributes as a strong outside blocker. Garcon hasn't been a world-beater in recent years, but he is a consistent, reliable pass-catcher who should continue to rack up catches and move the chains as a vital part of the Niners attack in the coming years. Following the release of Torrey Smith , the Niners were in need of a No. 1 option in the passing game, and they got one with the signing of Garcon. Major question marks remain within the San Francisco offense with Brian Hoyer currently the team's top available quarterback , but Garcon provides a reliable target and will join a system he is familiar with. Garcon's best season came when 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan was his offensive coordinator in Washington, and that should give him an opportunity to be highly productive immediately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:38:35.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
