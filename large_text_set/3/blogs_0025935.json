But don't fret; while they're no longer available in most restaurant locations, we've come up with our own take on this irresistible treat. Or, see if you can track one down at one of a handful of franchises that still make the good stuff . Deep-Fried Apple Pies From Brandi Milloy, POPSUGAR Food Ingredients 1 Pink Lady or Honeycrisp apple 4 tablespoons brown sugar, packed 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, freshly grated 1/2 teaspoon allspice 1 box puff pastry sheets, thawed overnight in the fridge Vegetable, peanut, or canola oil for frying Directions Peel and roughly chop the apples. Transfer to a large saucepan, and add the sugar, spices, and butter; cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes or until tender. Allow to cool. Cut each puff pastry sheet into four equal-sized strips. For each apple pie, spoon 2 tablespoons of apple mixture on one side of each puff pastry strip. Brush the edges of puff pastry with water before folding the pastry over to cover the filling. Crimp closed with the tines of a fork. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to firm up the dough. Meanwhile, heat 1 inch of oil to 350Â°F in a large, heavy-bottomed dutch oven or pot. Fry pies 2 or 3 at a time for about 2 minutes or until golden brown, flipping once. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate. Serve hot. Information", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:43:43.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
