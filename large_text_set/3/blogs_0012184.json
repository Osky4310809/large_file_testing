Wiz Khalifa on tour, Tech N9ne and Krizz Kaliko talking “Drama” and Khalid and The Roots on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon are closely behind. Music from IAMSU!, Key!, Beleaf and newcomer Corey Lee also make the list.

The track follows “Gucci On My” featuring 21 Savage, YG and Migos. Busting at the seams with 808s and Sean’s lyrical proficiency, the song is a definite slapper. Ransom 2 is expected to arrive on March 24. lil yachty & Snoop Dogg –“GGN Interview” \nLil Yachty is Snoop Dogg’s latest victim of the GGN (Double G News Network) show, which finds the Doggfather asking Lil Boat about his fashion style, braids and seeing music in color.

As strange as it sounds, check it out anyway. IAMSU! –“Prescription plan” \nIAMSU! has revisited his Boss Up EP to drum up a video for “Prescription Plan.” The Bay Area rapper kicks it in a forest armed with a cowboy hat and a guitar as he channels his inner John Wayne. beleaf –“plate” \nKing’s Dream Entertainment artist Beleaf is back with a video for “Plate,” which finds the MC rapping over a beat he entirely beat-boxes. The video comes after his announcement that he has a new project on the way, which follows his 2014 effort, Red Pills + Black Sugar. corey lee –“a shot in the dark” \nPhilly MC Corey Lee finally delivers his debut album, A Shot In The Dark, an 11-track project featuring production from rising producers like Cousin Vinny ( 21 Savage, PnB Rock) and KilConfirmed (Mir Fontane).
