A shake-up is coming. \nSeason-ticket holders who didn’t attend any games during the 2016 season are getting the boot, opening up seats for people at the front of the nearly 75,000 deep waiting list — roughly the capacity of the Broncos’ home stadium — for the first time in six years, Broncos spokesman Patrick Smyth said in an e-mail. \nBeyond giving people patiently waiting on the list a chance at a seat, the idea is to reward loyal season-ticket holders who have helped the Broncos set the longest home sellout streak in the NFL (47 years) with a chance to upgrade their seats, he said. \nHe did not say how the Broncos know which ticket holders didn’t attend any games last season. He also did not say how many season-ticket licenses will not be renewed. There are nearly 22,000 season-ticket holders. \nEarlier this year, the Broncos announced that for the first time since 2011 , ticket prices will not increase. An average price will be about $101 — lower than the 10 most expensive tickets in the NFL. Prior to the ho-hum 2016 season, Broncos tickets sold on the secondary market for two to three times their face value at an average of $454, according to TicketIQ.
