Embodying minimalist and contemporary sensibilities, the three-story home boasts a blacked-out facade as a stark contrast to its traditional neighbors.\nWith the idea of “design is humanistic,” Behar’s home aimed to “create experiences that are a lot more magical, without the least amount of effort.” A blend of material and textures prominent throughout the interior and exterior invite touch, as well as functionality with the implementation of technology. A standout feature consists of doors unlocking when approached.\nFilled with contemporary art, alongside objects acquired from adventures, in addition to political statements that promote peace — each element in the home serves functionality as well as personal significance.\nIn case you missed it, Yves Behar’s design contribution is also evident on the upcoming Samsung Frame TV . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:39:45.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
