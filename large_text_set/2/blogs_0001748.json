The brand should have no problem selling these specialty sushi Kit Kats to celebrate the opening of their first street-facing Tokyo shop on February 2. \nThe treats are modeled after three types of sushi: maguro (tuna), tamago (egg), and uni (sea urchin). Fortunately for customers, the chocolate only looks like seafood. The red \"tuna\" bar is actually raspberry-flavored, the \"egg\" Kit Kat is pumpkin, and the \"uni\" Kit Kat tastes like mascarpone and melon. Instead of sushi rice, the chocolate sits on a pillow of white-chocolate-covered puffed rice. The seaweed you see on the tamago and uni roll is the real thing, so diners should be prepared to mix sweet and savory. \nAs Kotaku reports, the limited batch of products will be available at the store until February 4. kit kat sushi set to roll into tokyo stores this february | DesignBoom https://t.co/egpG06pH1e pic.twitter.com/J0YePOlX21 \n— Steveston Social (@StevestonSocial) January 31, 2017 \nIf you’re hoping to be one of the lucky few to sample these creations, it’ll cost you: A set of sushi sells for 3000 yen, or $26. It’s a good thing it’s fairly easy to make your own dessert sushi at home. \nHeader/banner images: Fieldafar via Wikimedia Commons // CC BY-SA 4.0 More from mental_floss...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:59:37.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
