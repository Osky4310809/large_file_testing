Back in the country where I spent my childhood. So happy to have scored, but sad to have left the pitch that early. Fingers crossed #mufc pic.twitter.com/nDXczXCoIH \n— Henrikh Mkhitaryan (@HenrikhMkh) February 22, 2017 United looking for silverware \nThe Red Devils are in the hunt for several pieces of silverware this season, with their first final on Sunday in the EFL Cup. \nUnited could now be without Mkhitaryan and Michael Carrick who also looked to have struggled with injury. \nRegardless, the club are still fighting in the FA Cup, EFL Cup, Europa League and Premier League. \nShould the club even pull off just one of them or maybe two, that would be impressive for Mourinho’s first season.
