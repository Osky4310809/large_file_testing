She’s tricked into appearing on camera, believing that she’s there because she’s won an award, and while she’s most certainly won an award (she won the Purple Heart back in 2013) the bigger surprise is that Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is there.\nIf you’re a diehard fan of The Rock , or even just a human being with a pulse, you’re going to be over the goddamn moon to meet this guy because he seems like one of the nicest human beings on Planet Earth. But Dwayne Johnson’s not just there to meet Marlene and surprise her with his presence. Instead, he’s there to surprise her with a brand new 2018 Ford Mustang courtesy of the Ford Motor Company.\nI don’t think I’m alone in feeling a wave of emotion here. Marlene’s clearly a woman who feels immense pride in being able to serve her country, and I’m grateful knowing that people like her are out there protecting our freedoms. This is someone who has EARNED the chance to have wonderful things happen to her, and wonderful things happen they have. She insisted that she didn’t deserve this 2018 Ford Mustang and she’s wrong in that assessment. If anyone deserves awards like this it’s people like Marlene, and there aren’t many like her on this earth.\n( h/t AutoBlog ) \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T16:13:54.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
