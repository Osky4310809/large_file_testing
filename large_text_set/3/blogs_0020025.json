All the ways you can watch and follow Sky Sports F1 in 2017 \n\"They were the quickest in testing, we couldn't match them,\" he said. \"So when we get out there this weekend it'll be interesting to see where we've come from testing, what we've learnt and how we apply it, and really where we do stand. \n\"It is unknown whether we're level, they're ahead, or they're behind.\" \nRed Bull surprised most observers during testing by introducing an unexpectedly-minimalist car and then ran inconspicuously during the eight days of action at Barcelona. But Hamilton remains wary of the team which dominated F1 before Mercedes claimed supremacy at the start of the sport's hybrid power era. In a year of dramatic change, watch Sky F1's 2017 season opener ahead of the Australian Grand Prix. \n\"I'm very keen to see what Red Bull bring because they were quite a long way behind through testing - at least compared to Ferrari,\" he said. \"I assume they are bringing something here which I am excited to see.\" \nStung by a series of backfiring overly-optimistic predictions in recent seasons, Ferrari have kept their public pronouncements to a minimum ahead of the new campaign. But the team's talking on track during pre-season testing offered a compelling hint they had caught Mercedes as Vettel and team-mate Kimi Raikkonen frequently appeared at the top of the timesheets. \n\"Mercedes have been in very strong form over the last three years and even though we have changed the rules and regulations if a team is strong they will be strong the year after no matter what you do with the rules,\" said Vettel. \nDespite winning all-but one of the last seven championships, Vettel and Hamilton have rarely fought each other on track - neither has been runner-up to the other in any of their title-winning campaigns. But Ferrari's winter surge has apparently set the stage for an overdue battle between the three-time and four-time world champions. \n\"I would love that and l think the fans would love to see that,\" said Hamilton. Lights out for the 2017 season curtain-raiser at 6am on Sunday March 26 \nIf only Fernando Alonso could join in the fun too. The Spaniard, still considered by many to be the best driver in the sport, is facing up to another year on the periphery at McLaren with his absence at the front seemingly the only guarantee heading into the new season. \n\"But we need this guy to have a good car so that he can get up there and fight with us,\" acknowledged Hamilton. \"The sport needs that and he deserves that. You want to be racing against the best.\" \nIn the meantime, the long-awaited fight between Hamilton and Vettel will just have to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T08:28:12.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
