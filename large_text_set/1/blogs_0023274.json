I should have kept my control, even if it was in a hectic time.\" Media playback is not supported on this device I apologise, I should've shut up! - Wenger Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T21:40:51.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
