During his guest appearance on Taylor Bennett’s “Neon Lights” track off the Restoration of an American Idol album that also features Supa Bwe , the 19-year-old rapper addresses the criticism he’s received for his past comments saying he didn’t grow up on many esteemed Hip Hop acts. \n“Tired of niggas talkin’’bout this is the way you got to do it/ And you got to respect this type of person/ And you got to listen to that type of person/ Fuck all of that shit, I’m doing it the way I wanna do it,” he intros before going into a verse about how much money he has and how many bad and boujee women he bags. \nLil Yachty has been open about not being familiar with Tupac or Biggie, even calling the Bad Boy legend “overrated” in Pitchfork’s popular Over/Under video series before clarifying that he “never meant to disrespect anybody,” adding, “I know who the legends are and I know the legacy that he brung.” \nHe also commented that he can’t name five songs from either icon . \nHe seemingly received criticism from Anderson .Paak over his statements and some more blatant attacks from several others (just peep our comments section). Many, including Pete Rock and Lord Jamar , have blasted the Atlanta artist ( he doesn’t classify himself as a rapper ) for his mumble rap style. \nThe Quality Control signee is preparing the release of his debut album, Teenage Emotions .
