I think blow jobs are pretty great. I just don’t think we need a stupid day dedicated to them. This is why Steak And Blow Job day sucks for everyone involved.\n1. It assumes oral sex is some sort of special treat women only begrudgingly give out one day of the year For whatever reason, the bizarre and sexist notion still exists that all men have sky-high sex drives, while women can meekly take or leave it.\nThe truth is everyone’s different. Some men aren’t that into sex. Some women love giving head. So do some men. But none of those truths are acceptable to our society.\nThe script is still that males are sex-obsessed man-boys with permanent semis while females are either reluctant good girls or horrific sluts.\nSteak and a blow job day says ‘come on ladies, I know you’re not that bothered about the whole sex thing but I bought you some £5 flowers for Valentine’s Day, now it’s time for me to get what I want’. What a load of bull.\n2. Putting pressure on women to perform a sex act can suck MY d*** If I have to explain why there’s something wrong with a day that bullies people into sex, especially a kind of sex they might not enjoy, then I can’t help you.\nJust do society a favour and get chemically castrated now.\n3. It’s as exclusive and depressing as Valentine’s Day Suppose you have a penis and you’d quite like to get involved in Steak And Blow Job Day.\nBut you’re single.\nSure, you could try to convince someone on Tinder to join you (good luck with that) or you could go to the local Angus, alone, get drunk then never be able to look your Henry hoover in the eye again.\nJust like I could send myself a big bouquet of roses and have dinner with a cardboard cutout of Ryan Gosling on Valentine’s Day.\n4. It’s not men’s version of Valentine’s Day Valentine’s Day is men’s version of Valentine’s Day. If you’re not both eating dead cows and rutting away on that hallowed day you’re probably incompatible anyway.\n5. We all deserve better than this Sex is a marvellous, complex, multifaceted thing.\nPicking a sex act and lumping it in with steak, like some fancy new Subway sandwich, is an insult, no matter how well-seasoned the steak.\n6. We don’t need days for sex acts Are you one of those twee little couples who mark sex days in your calendar?\nI guess Steak And Blow Job Day is for you, just to remind you to actually get physically intimate with the person you’re supposedly in love with once a year.\nLet’s hope there’s soon a snogging day, and a ‘finishing her off with your hand’ day too, or they’ll soon fall by the wayside as well.\n7. If we did need a day for sex acts, it would not be blow jobs Having a day for blow jobs is like having a day for bread. It’s always on the menu anyway, isn’t it? What’s the point? It’s boring.\nIf we must have a day dedicated to a sex act, surely it should be something unusual, that you’d only do once a year like, I don’t know, trying to reenact the most cringe-worthy sex scenes from Alan Titchmarsh’s oeuvre while both dressed as the man himself.\n8. The fact that it’s followed by a day seemingly dedicated to cunnilingus doesn’t make up for anything Chicken And Licking Day is an actual thing. Supposedly one for the girls.\nFirstly, as if chicken is as good as steak. Secondly, if your technique can be summed up simply by the word ‘licking’ I regret to inform you you are probably extremely bad at this sex act.\nAlso, not all women like cunnilingus anyway, not all men like doing it, and see above for why putting pressure on anyone to do anything they don’t like in the bedroom is a d*** move.\n9. What about vegans? Seriously, what about them? Does seitan steak count? Is sperm vegan? Why are we pairing a sex act with a dead animal anyway? Seems pretty niche.\n10. Chlamydia of the throat Still planning on celebrating Steak And BJ Day? Stay safe, kids.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T07:30:55.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
