He’s the president of the United States. He’s these servicemen’s commander-in-chief. \nThat did not stop Chris Rowzee, spokeswoman for Indivisible Kentucky, an activist organization reportedly formed after Trump’s election victory, from telling the Courier-Journal that, “We are very concerned by this partisan political act by apparent military members in official military vehicles.” \n“Our nation’s military must remain loyal to the Constitution, and not any one individual. It’s critical to our democracy that the American public be able to trust that their military is apolitical and nonpartisan,” she continued. \n“This type of blatant partisan political display demonstrating allegiance to a singular person brings to mind the types of actions historically seen in authoritarian regimes and dictatorships. It’s chilling. I truly hope the Navy conducts a thorough investigation into this incident and takes appropriate corrective action.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:55:12.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
