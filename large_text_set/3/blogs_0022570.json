Travis County is the site of Austin, the state’s capitol. \n“Today’s report from DHS is deeply disturbing and highlights the urgent need for a statewide sanctuary city ban in Texas,” said Republican Governor Greg Abbott. \nRiverside Regional Jail in Hopewell City, Virginia released a convicted rapist, while three men – two in Texas and one in Oregon – were released despite being convicted of indecent exposure. \nBoulder County Jail in Colorado refused to honor six detainers, involving individuals convicted of assault and burglary and charged of possession of cocaine. \nIt is worth noting that the number of illegal immigrants wanted by ICE who were released by a local jurisdiction could be much higher, as officials in Cook Co., Illinois (Chicago) refuse to communicate with ICE at all. \n“It is not acceptable for jurisdictions to refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement by releasing criminal aliens back into our communities when our law required them to be deported,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
