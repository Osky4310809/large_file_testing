Learn which Winter ingredients can help cleanse the body and how to incorporate them into your next meal. Beets \nFor those times when my body feels heavy or weighed down, my doctor always recommends beets. Their fiber increases the production of antioxidant enzymes in the liver, helping the body eliminate bile and other toxic substances. Sometimes simple is best, like this recipe for roasted beets . Leafy Greens \nDark, leafy greens like spinach, kale, and chicory are full of essential nutrients like vitamins A and C, but it's the chlorophyll levels that help the body detox and alkalize. To take in all the cleansing properties of leafy greens, it's best to enjoy them raw; try POPSUGAR Food's recipe for a shredded kale and brussels sprouts salad . Cabbage \nBelieved by many to have good-luck properties, cabbage (and other cruciferous vegetables) promotes healthy liver function, stimulating the body's natural detoxification process. This Winter, we can't stop eating the rainbow cabbage salad with tahini-lemon dressing .
