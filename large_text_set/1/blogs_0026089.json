Bush — the inclusion of Bannon to a permanent seat has many criticizing the move and questioning the influence of the often-shocking former media head. \nBannon is characterized by many on the left as a “white nationalist,” although he has balked at that description and told CNN in November he calls himself an “economic nationalist.” Bannon has been a target of Democratic criticism since his selection by Trump. Many liberals have pointed to incendiary Breitbart headlines — items that mock “trannies,” labeled Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol a “renegade Jew” and more — in urging Trump to cut ties with Bannon. He dismissed that criticism, casting it as disappointment from Democrats who expected Trump to lose. “They were ready to coronate Hillary Clinton. That didn’t happen, and I’m one of the reasons why. So, by the way, I wear these attacks as an emblem of pride,” he said. \nBannon, who will now sit in on meetings related to national security with the new executive order, is a native of Virginia, is a Navy veteran, a Harvard graduate and an alum of Goldman Sachs. After working in film production, he met Andrew Breitbart, founder of Breitbart News, and was tapped to chair the media company. Under his direction, Breitbart become one of the most read conservative news sites during the eight years of President Barack Obama’s presidency. Critics have accused it of being xenophobic and misogynistic, and associating it with the “alt-right.” \nHis permanent seat at NSC meetings, which hosts the primary group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs, has many wondering just how influential Bannon is within the Trump inner circle. \nThe NSC is led by lieutenant-general Mike Flynn , one of Trump’s most ardent supporters during the election, who also faced criticism for his association with the alternative right when his son used Twitter to help perpetuate a conspiracy theory involving a pizza parlor and Hillary Clinton. Flynn’s son was ultimately fired by the transition team. \nAs for Mr. Bannon, who has called the media the “opposition party” and last week said the press needed to “keep it’s mouth shut,” he is apparently part of a new vision for national security under Trump. \n“The security threats facing the United States in the 21st century transcend international boundaries,” Mr Trump’s executive order said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T18:14:15.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
