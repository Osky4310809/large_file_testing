Then Porsche Exclusive has the option package for you. \n-Limited to the 911 Carrera S , the 911 Carrera 4S , and the 911 Targa 4S, the Porsche Exclusive 3.0S Powerkit package offers a 30-hp boost courtesy of changes to the engine’s electronics, as well as a pair of larger turbochargers that are bolted to the models’ 3.0-liter flat-six engine. Total output is a 911 GTS–matching 450 horsepower. While additional oomph is the kit’s headline item, the package also includes modifications to the brake-cooling system, a sport exhaust, and the Sport Chrono package, which includes items such as dynamic engine mounts, a driving-mode switch on the steering wheel, and an analog stopwatch mounted at the top of the dashboard.\n-Notably, Porsche will allow customers to add the kit retroactively to turbocharged 911 Carrera S, 911 Carrera 4S, and 911 Targa 4S models that are already equipped with the Sport Chrono package.\n- - First Ride: 2018 Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid - Porsche CEO: 911 GT2 Is Coming, Will Be PDK Only - Porsche 911 Research: Specs, Reviews, Pricing, and More - -Don’t expect the extra ponies to come cheap, though. The option costs a cool $12,350 on 911s equipped with the standard seven-speed manual transmission, and that price rises by another $520, to $12,870, on cars equipped with the PDK dual-clutch automatic transmission. But, hey, Porsche doesn’t rake in a reported $17,250 in profit for every vehicle it sells by just giving extra horsepower away.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:46:59.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
