But I’m desperate for help because she does have attachment needs and she doesn’t take rejection well.\n‘She lashes out and will have a full on meltdown, like she did at school. But she’s only five years old.\n‘During the first week she was fine, but the second week the school insisted on keeping her in two hours a day rather than taking her full-time.\n‘They started to introduce boundaries and that’s when Lilly kicked off. She likes to be in control and apparently she hurt a teacher with a stick.\nLilly’s mother, Emily, said that teachers were unable to control her daughter (Picture: Caters) ‘The school are now saying they can’t have her because of “safeguarding”, but if I’d kept Lilly off for this long I’d be in prison.\n‘Every time I spoke to the school about a teaching assistant they told us they were interviewing for somebody and had even done second interviews, but nobody ever appeared.’\nEmily has now criticised Emscote Infant School, saying it breaks her heart to watch her daughter put on her uniform each morning, only for her to cry when she’s told she has to stay at home.\nSponsored Things that secretly make you really happy She added that Lilly has even tried to escape in an effort to see her friends, forcing her to put locks on the windows.\nExplaining her attachment needs she said: ‘Once, she kept me up for hours and hours after watching The Lion King, asking me if I was going to die and if Nan was going to die just like Mufasa did.\n‘She’s lashed out at me when she’s been wound up and we get thrown off buses because of her behaviour.\nA spokesperson for Warwickshire County Council said: ‘They [Emscote Infant School] have confirmed that Lilly has now transferred to another local school and is therefore no longer attending Emscote Primary School.\n‘Therefore it would be inappropriate for the school to comment further. ‘", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T13:52:32.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
