I need to show them that we are stronger,\" Everton told the Mail. \"We can't simply choose to run away. I will always fight against these types of people.

Unfortunately it's not just here that there are people with these kinds of attitudes. But I also don't want them to suffer. If it hurts me this much, I can't imagine them hurting too.\" \nEverton also described in detail the his horrific experience, admitting the insults made him 'very angry.' \n\"The fans were shouting calling me a monkey, imitating the animal the whole time,\" he added. \"When I got close, I could hear it more loudly and I became very angry. But even so I had to carry on playing and representing my team.'\" \nVile supporters unveiled a banner insulting Brazilian star Luiz before the end of the match. \nThe referee halted the game while the banner was removed, while public messages were released by stewards to try and get the Rad fans to stop their chanting.

They were all attacking me. Marko Nikolic says that Luiz was abused (Photo: Ian Walton) \n\"I want to forget this as soon as possible. I love Serbia and the people here, that is why I cried. \n\"But please say no to racism!\" \nPartizan coach Marko Nikolic added: \"It's a return to the reality of Serbian football. \n\"Everton should not have reacted but something provoked his outburst, didn't it?\" \nThere has been a series of incidents with racist motives that have marred Serbian football in recent years. \nEngland Under-21's black players, including Manchester City's Raheem Sterling and Tottenham's Danny Rose, suffered abuse from the stands during a match which took place in 2012.

Fighting spilled onto the pitch as Serbia and Albania clashed (Photo: REUTERS) \nA 2014 international qualifier against Albania was also abandoned due to fan violence after a flag was flown above the Partizan Stadium, causing riots between players. \nUEFA banned Albania fans from attending the Group I clash but a drone carrying an Albanian flag, apparently featuring a map of Kosovo, was flown over the pitch. \nSerbia defender Stefan Mitrovic pulled down the flag, leading to a mass brawl between the players. Riot police then moved in when around a dozen fans invaded the pitch and attacked Albania players - with one hooligan throwing a stool at striker Bekim Balaj. \nEarlier that evening, Serbia supporters had burned a NATO flag in the stands, before clashing with police.
