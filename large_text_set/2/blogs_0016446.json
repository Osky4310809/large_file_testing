IfItWereMyHome.Com Trump later clarified he’d been referring to a segment he watched on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on FOX News. Twitter Twitter But, that FOX News segment was also full of untruths about Sweden. \nThe segment in question featured filmmaker Ami Horowitz discussing his recent documentary , “Stockholm Syndrome,” which highlights the supposed consequences of Sweden’s liberal immigration policies. \nBut, here’s the thing, the documentary misrepresents what’s going on in Sweden, and police who were featured in it even said their statements were completely taken out of context and the film is “bad journalism.” Swedish cops featured in film shown by Fox say they were selectively edited https://t.co/qYYRMHqhop #swedenincident Fox News is #FakeNews pic.twitter.com/Qs1uHXFhoE \n— Khary Penebaker (@kharyp) February 20, 2017 \nHere are the facts: \nLike many Western countries struggling to respond to the global refugee crisis, Sweden is currently engaged in an ongoing debate on the issue of immigration. \nIn 2015, Sweden, which prides itself for its humanitarianism, processed 163,000 asylum applications . \nAround 46 percent of Swedes believe the influx of refugees has led to a rise in crime, according to Pew Research Center. \nBut, like America, the perception of the link between immigrants, refugees and crime does not match reality. Statistics do not back up the notion immigrants and refugees have led to a crime wave in Sweden. Sweden’s crime rate has actually fallen since 2005 . \"…statistics in Sweden do not back up the suggestion that immigrants have created a major crime wave.\" https://t.co/ALF9C98EYc pic.twitter.com/wsjJpMofHV \n— Eric Geller (@ericgeller) February 21, 2017 . @Nigel_Farage contrary to UKIP/Trump myths, there was no steep rise in crime, even sexual crime, as a result of Sweden welcoming refugees. pic.twitter.com/xug3YGUJpk \n— Matt Haig (@matthaig1) February 20, 2017 Contrary to what Trump said, the crime rate has decreased in #Sweden . However, #Islamophobic crimes have increased. #swedenattack pic.twitter.com/iAwKRzbrUM \nCorrespondingly, in the US, statistics show native-born Americans are more likely to commit violent crimes and be incarcerated than immigrants. \nAmerica, in general, is a violent place — not because of immigrants, but because of its inhabitants. \nThe US ranks number one in the world in firearms per capita , according to the Council on Foreign Relations. \nWith roughly 5 percent of the world’s population, it possesses somewhere between 35 and 50 percent of the world’s civilian-owned guns. \nThe US also has the highest homicide-by-firearm rate in the developed world. \nThis is linked to why former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt tweeted there was 50 percent more murders in the area Trump gave his speech than in the entirety of Sweden last year. Twitter \nTrump’s speech was actually in Melbourne, Florida , but Bildt still has a point. \nWhen it comes down to it, the US is far behind many other countries in the developed world on a number of levels, especially Sweden (as the chart above shows). In many respects, America is actually the most dangerous country in the world, and a lot of countries feel that way. \nThis map of the world shows which country others view as the most dangerous. \nNotice a trend? \nA lot of countries view America as the biggest threat to world peace . \nThe data for this map comes from research conducted in 2013 and doesn’t account for Trump’s presidency. \nIt could be argued, due to his almost complete lack of diplomacy, anti-immigrant stance and enthusiastic remarks about nuclear weapons , even more likely view America as a threat in the present day. Reddit \nWhen you take a moment to think about it, it makes sense much of the world sees the US as the top threat. \nThere are roughly 15,000 nuclear weapons worldwide, and the US has around 6,800 of them . \nThe US has roughly 800 military bases worldwide , and it’s essentially the modern-day Roman Empire. \nAmerica possesses the capacity to wipe countries off the face of the Earth and has gone to war under dubious circumstances . \nLong story short, it seems America could use a healthy dose of perspective. \nAmericans pose a far greater threat to themselves than immigrants or refugees. \nAs of approximately 1:30 pm on Tuesday, February 21, there have already been 2,169 deaths from gun violence in the US in 2017 alone. \nMeanwhile, no refugees from the Middle East have ever killed Americans in a terror attack on US soil. \nDoes what we fear make sense? It’s a question worth asking. Is America's Fear Of Foreign Terrorism Rational?
