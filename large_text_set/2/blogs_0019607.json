Here are the most important things he said. (Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images) There are more executive orders coming our way \nWhen asked if the White House was all but done signing executive orders, Spicer said, “We have several that are in the pipeline.” On Rex Tillerson and John Kelly’s trip to Mexico City \nWhen asked if this was a “clean up job” to repair relations between the two countries, Spicer said no. “The U.S. and Mexico have an unbelievable relationship right now, and there is a robust dialogue between both nations.” Trump will not watch the Oscars Sunday night \n“I’ve got to be honest with you, I think the president will be hosting the Governors Ball that night,” Spicer said when asked if Trump would be watching. “The first lady has put a lot of time into this event, welcoming our nation’s governors to the capital. I have a feeling that’s where the president and first lady are going to be focused on Sunday night, so we’ll go from there.” \n“This is not a representative of a congressional district…. Just because they are loud, doesn’t necessarily mean that there are many.” What Trump will say in his speech to Congress this Tuesday \nSpicer said the speech will be more vision-focused, rather than policy. He will do a “fair amount” of traveling to states afterwards. On those rowdy GOP town halls \n“I think there’s a hybrid there,” Spicer said, meaning between actual anger and professional protesters. “I think some people are clearly upset. But there is a bit of professional protester, manufactured base in there.” \n“Just because they’re loud doesn’t mean they are many, and in a lot of cases, I think that’s what you’re seeing”, arguing that the town halls were not a true representation of the voter base in each district.” Expect further guidance from the administration on transgender bathrooms \nSpicer said that Barack Obama’s guidance that schools should let students use the bathroom that matches their “sexual identity” was being reviewed. He also shot down reports that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was not on board with this. \n“They have been reviewing the guidance that was signed, the basis by which it was put through, and I think there have been several areas of concern, both legal and procedural, that they have been discussing,” Spicer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:47:51.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
