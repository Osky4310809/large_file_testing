Wike \nHe said: “Without your air power, it would have been difficult to dislodge the Boko Haram terrorists. I want to commend the Nigerian Air Force for the sacrifices you have made for the security of the country. Please keep it up. \n“The only problem I have with security agencies is when they get themselves involved in the snatching of electoral materials. The Nigerian Air Force and the Nigerian Navy have always kept away from electoral malpractices. Our relationship will continue to wax stronger as long as the Nigerian Air Force concentrates on security matters.” \nWike further appealed to the Airforce to allow the state government build a modern motor park on a boundary with the Airfroce base on Aba Road to move vehicles loading around the base to the motor park. \nAir Commodore Madi, in his address earlier, had appealed for logistic support from the state government, promising that the security body will continue to contribute meaningfully to security of lives and property in the state.
