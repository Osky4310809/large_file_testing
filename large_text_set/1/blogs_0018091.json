Moreno's goal, which is his third so far this season, marked the second time that he has clinched a game-winner for the club since last August. \nDuring a time in which there are plenty of question marks in Mexico's backline, the 29-year-old central defender supplies a significant source of consistency and confidence for national team manager Juan Carlos Osorio. \nWhile others like Diego Reyes, Rafael Marquez and Carlos Salcedo have no secured spots in Osorio's starting XI, it is a near-guarantee that Moreno will continue to have a constant presence in Mexico's defense. \nAs long as he continues to shine for his club, the PSV player should be able to hold onto his key role for El Tri this year --- which features highly significant Confederations Cup and World Cup qualifying matches. \nWith a superb performance over the Eredivisie weekend, Moreno leads this week's list of the Mexicans in Europe. \nAndres Guardado, MF, PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands) \nGuardado must also be given credit for his role in Sunday's win. The central midfielder took charge of the team with his distribution and defensive responsibilities that helped carry them to the narrow win. Guardado was unlucky to not finish with an assist. \nDiego Reyes, DF, Espanyol (Spain) \nOne week after playing as a right-back, Reyes returned to his usual starting spot as a central defender in Saturday's 3-1 win over Granada. The Mexican international was vital with his numerous clearances and interceptions in the backline. \nJavier Hernandez, FW, Bayer Leverkusen (Germany) \nThe Mexican striker started 2017 on a positive note with an assist in Sunday's 3-1 victory against Hertha BSC. Hernandez played the full 90 minutes for Leverkusen and finished with four shots the German club. \nGuillermo Ochoa, GK, Granada (Spain) \nOn the other side of the pitch, Ochoa dealt with a total of eight shots on target by Espanyol. Although the goalkeeper was able to make five saves, he could do little to stop the three other opportunities that lead to Granada's loss. \nPedro Arce, MF, Veria (Greece) \nArce took part in the last 45 minutes of Saturday's 1-1 draw with Iraklis. The weekend's draw was the first time that the midfielder was left out of Veria's starting XI since last September. \nHector Herrera, MF, Porto (Portugal) \nPorto's captain was the team's lead distributor in Saturday's 4-2 win over Rio Ave. Although the midfielder was at times quiet during his 90 minutes on the field, Herrera has continued to build off of his newfound energy seen in the start of the year. \nMiguel Layun, DF, Porto (Portugal) Miguel Layun had one of his worst performances for Porto, as he conceded a penalty and was subbed for after 56 minutes. \nOver the weekend, Layun was arguably the worst player for Porto. Following a clumsy tackle early in the second half, which led to a penalty and ensuing goal for Rio Ave, the defender was then substituted out during the 56th minute. Defensively, a very poor showing from the 28-year-old. \nJesus Manuel Corona, FW, Porto (Portugal) \nAfter suffering an injury to his left thigh, Corona only took part in the first 45 minutes of Porto's recent 4-2 win. Following the knock, the winger was left out of Sunday's team training. \nCarlos Salcedo, DF, Fiorentina (Italy) \nSalcedo was left on the bench for Saturday's 3-0 away victory over Chievo Verona. The 23-year-old on loan from Chivas has now been left on the sidelines during Fiorentina's last two league matches. \nJonathan dos Santos, MF, Villarreal (Spain) \nVillarreal's right midfielder played a total of 83 minutes in the 2-0 loss at home to Valencia. Despite the key opportunities created by Dos Santos in the attack, they could do little to help find a goal over the weekend. \nCarlos Vela, FW, Real Sociedad (Spain) \nVela took part in 71 minutes of Sunday's 1-0 win against Celta Vigo. The striker finished the win with three shots, one of which was on target. \nNo playing time \nMarco Fabian, MF, Eintracht Frankfurt (Germany) \nDue to an injury , Fabian was left on the sidelines during Saturday's 3-0 away loss to RB Leipzig. \nRaul Jimenez, FW, Benfica (Portugal) \nAlthough Jimenez is no longer injured, it appears as though Benfica manager Rui Vitoria is in no rush to bring the striker back to the pitch. The 25-year-old was left out of the gameday roster for Sunday's 4-0 victory over Tondela. \nCesar Hernandez covers Liga MX and the Mexican national team for ESPN FC.
