Photographed by Phil Oh It’s not easy to come back to reality after gazing at the elegance of couture . Luckily, there are plenty of new spots throughout the city perfect for perpetuating the magic of Paris off the runways. From a museum that explores the thorough history of perfume to intricately opulent bijoux, these are the new venues serving up the perfect allongé in the City of Light this month (and beyond). Eat: Le Grand Bain Hooray for 2017: British-born chef Edward Delling Williams opened a Belleville-situated bistro in the very same spirit as his former 11th Arrondissement kitchen, Au Passage . The inviting interior has a warmly rustic feel, highlighting exposed beams and bricks. A substantive horseshoe-shaped bar splits the room in two, while the back kitchen’s industrious activity is conspicuous through rectangular windows. The daily blackboard menu ( . . . rotating even during the course of service) features gorgeously plated small dishes to share—think perfectly cooked scallops with roasted vegetables or a portion of hearty lamb with prunes—accompanied by natural and biodynamic wines. Explore: Le Grand Musée du Parfum Opened in December, the Grand Musée du Parfum is housed in a lavish 19th-century hôtel particulier (mansion), once the headquarters for Christian Lacroix’s maison de couture . The museum traces the history of scent: a ritual offering to gods in ancient Egypt, a talisman and panacea in the Middle Ages, a direct link to fashion at the dawn of the 20th century thanks to pioneer Paul Poiret. The museum provides a hands-on (noses-on?) approach to exploring the olfactive, including in situ tests that reveal the limitations of smell based on gender and geographical roots. Drink: Paris Cocktail Week Reinvented classics and creative takes on the cocktail flourish during Paris Cocktail Week (January 21–28), which just so happens to coincide with couture. Throughout the city, mixology marvels are highlighted across dinners, pairings, and master classes—but for those who just want to sip something tasty and surprising, some 50 bars are serving signature drinks at a cut rate. A few especially enticing tipples to try: La Mauny Qui Dirige Le Monde at Le Syndicat (aged rum, banana syrup, cold-brew coffee), Dragon Rouge at Le Peninsula ( mao-tai, vodka, dark chocolate liqueur, bitter Aztec chocolate, raspberry coulis, pepper, and a shot of sparkling sake), and Summer Wine at Le Mary Celeste (Lillet blanc aperitif, an English liqueur, Japanese umeshu, pineapple, lime, and Thai basil ). Clink, clink to that. Discover: L’École Presents Dedicated to jewels and objets, L’École des Arts Joailliers (the School of Jewelry Arts) is launching a cycle of art exhibitions open to the public: “L’École Presents.” The Place Vendôme hub, founded in 2012 with the support of the Maison Van Cleef & Arpels, features expert-led classes and conferences. Timed with its fifth birthday, the space will host the inaugural exhibition, “Retour d’Expédition”(Return From the Expedition), from January 23 to February 1. The sculptural showpieces on view are by haute jeweler Harumi Klossowska de Rola, who pulled inspiration from the rich traditions of Mexico, Egypt, and Asia. The next exhibition, of Daniel Brush’s work, will fall within the next couture cycle in July. Caffeinate: Beyond-the-Marais Cafés The Marais specialty coffee scene is a key gathering point for the creative set, but the scope is finally expanding beyond the Third Arrondissement. Check out new places that value curated interior design as much as freshly fragrant beans and perfect latte art: 5 Pailles (translation: 5 Straws ) and its neighboring flower shop–cum–coffee spot Peonies (both in the 10th Arrondissement), Passager (in the 11th Arrondissement ), and O Coffeeshop (in the 15th Arrondissement).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:35:44.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
