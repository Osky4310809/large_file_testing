Basically, to give a ring was a sign of eternal love. \nThe placement was key. There's a debate over whether it was the Egyptians or the Romans who started the idea of the ring finger, but whoever it was the reason remains the same. \nIt was thought the vein running through the finger led directly to the heart. She probably said yes - then wondered why he was on one knee (Photo: Getty) \nThe vein was called 'Vena Amoris' - the 'Vein of Love' - in Roman times. Scientists have since disproved this, but it's sort of true when you think all veins lead to your heart. Read More Reason why we get down on bended knee to propose - and the truth behind engagement traditions \nThe Romans, rather than offering the ring as a symbol of love, used it as a symbol of ownership. \nWe'll just skip over the fact they were used to for slavery or business partnerships too. That ruins the romance. \nMore practically, most people are right handed so the ring would get less worn if it was on the left hand. \nThe ring placement is just one of the many traditions passed on from the Egyptians and Romans. \nWeirder ones include the Egyptians pinching the bride on her wedding day for good luck. \nThe veil? The Romans thought it protected the bridge from evil spirits. Brides have worn veils ever since. \nWho knew?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T14:25:48.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
