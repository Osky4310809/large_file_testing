It sports a full array of inputs, though taking full advantage of its speed and low input lag requires DisplayPort or DVI. AOC doesn’t include any blur reduction in this display. It isn't really missed when you're using a 144Hz refresh, though. In fact, as we test more monitors with backlight strobing, we’re finding the luminance reduction to be anywhere from significant to extreme. While shortening the backlight’s pulse width is an effective way to reduce motion artifacts, it reduces light output by more than half. Using a fast refresh mode also reduces blur and doesn’t exact a penalty in brightness. This company recently introduced a G-Sync-capable model that incorporates all of the G2460PQU's features, but adds about $200 to the price. For users of GeForce GTX (650 Ti and up) video cards, consider checking it out. If you’re interested in saving a chunk of change or use an AMD graphics card, the 24-inch, 144Hz G2460PQU merits serious consideration instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T12:55:31.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
