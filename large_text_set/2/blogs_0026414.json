However, that leaves just seven or eight left alive on the Exuma Cays.\nThey were thrown into the sea after they were discovered on Friday according to the Bahamas Humane Society.\nPresident of the charity, Kim Aranha, told the Tribune: ‘I understand there are seven or eight pigs still alive. It’s still unclear on the number of animals that are dead.
