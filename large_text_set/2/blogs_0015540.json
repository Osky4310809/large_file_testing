King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 14 hours ago 25 \nDave Mustaine was recently asked about \" Master of Puppets \" being played while Megadeth was receiving the Best Metal Performance Grammy, admitting he didn't even notice the Metallica tune during the ceremony. \nBut after watching the footage, he branded the whole thing \"the worst version of 'Master of Puppets' I've ever heard.\" \nThe frontman told Radio.com : \"I was happy to have been there in any capacity, and to have been nominated for a Grammy... the Grammy is a symbol of excellence. And we worked for this fucker!\" \nFocusing on \"Master,\" Dave added: \"You know what? I didn't even notice it. It just sounded like some music in the background. The funny thing is that when I went back and listened to my acceptance speech, and I heard the song, I was like, 'Wow!' \n\"Everyone was asking me, 'What about the Metallica thing?' And I said, 'I didn't hear it, I just saw it.' 'How could you not have heard it?' I didn't know what they were talking about. I thought that they were talking about Metallicaâ€™s performance. Because we split [after the pre-televised awards]. By the time they did their thing with Lady Gaga, we were across the street eating dinner. \n\"So I went back and listened to my acceptance speech and I went, 'Wow!' I didn't mind them playing it at all, it's a house band, and they're doing cover songs. They were probably saying, 'We don't know any Megadeth songs, how about if we do a Metallica song?' \n\"But when I went back and listened to it, I was like, 'Oh my God, that's the worst version of 'Master of Puppets' I've ever heard in my life!\" \nResponding to the interviewer's remark that \"they could have just covered Sabbath instead of Metallica,\" Mustaine noted: \"They could've done a Cyndi Lauper song! [Laughs] \"I was just happy to be up there. It's about being recognized. We all want so badly, when we pick our careers as kids, to be the best at what we do, and when you choose to be a musician, the stakes are much different. The way they 'grade' us, the way they hold us in esteem, how you tell who is better than who.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:59:52.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
