For more companies, tips and profiles, check out the rest of 2017's Top Company Cultures package. \nWork should be gratifying. We should appreciate our colleagues. Our peers should inspire us. And our happy, efficient, productive workplaces should -- and will -- lead us all to greater success. \n“A high-performance culture leads not only to employee engagement but also to measurable business results,” says Greg Besner, founder and CEO of CultureIQ , which makes software that helps companies improve their culture. \nBut you don’t need to be told that. Of course all that’s true. Of course it’s what we all want. So why is it so hard to pull off? \nThere are a lot of small answers to that question, but here’s the big one: Company cultures fail when a company doesn’t consciously focus on making it better. Good culture doesn’t just happen -- or if it does, it’s fleeting and fragile. A truly strong one is nourished and grown, like any relationship . And oftentimes, when trying to cultivate a healthy culture, it helps to look at what other companies do, understand what they get right and adopt some of their best ideas. \nThat’s why Entrepreneur partnered with CultureIQ to find the best office cultures in America. We measured 10 areas that are predictive of high-performing cultures -- collaboration, innovation, agility, communication, suppport, wellness, work environment, responsibility, performance and mission alignment -- to quantify the success of the culture. We wanted to know: Who is worth learning from? And what makes them so good? \nAfter surveying thousands of companies, we narrowed the list down to 50 rankings across three different company sizes -- small, medium and large -- to bring you our Top Comany Cultures of 2017. (Each category did have a tie, making the list 153 companies.) \nTo see who made the cut, check out our lists below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:13:22.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
