No, I’m not talking about Pokemon GO, though that would still fit into this metric. I’m talking about Square Enix’s adaptations of classic computer games, re-imagining them for mobile to have completely different gameplay and stories, but still retaining the classic feel of each individual franchise. While checking out the recently released Hitman GO: VR Edition this morning, I noticed that the original Hitman GO , as well as its partner titles Deus Ex GO and Laura Croft GO are currently 80% off on the Google Play Store, making them only $.99 at the time of writing.\nSee also: 15 best Android games of 2017 2 weeks ago Hitman GO in particular has 4.5 stars with over 75,000 reviews, so you know this is a quality title. The others in the series have similar ratings as well, so if you’ve been looking for something to spend that hard-earned Google Opinion Rewards money on, this is a great option.\nHave you played any of these titles? Which is your favorite? Any other games you hope get ported to the GO series?
