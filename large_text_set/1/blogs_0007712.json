There are not many managers who have done what he did in one year,\" the former left-back said. \n\"I wish him luck. He is working very well, with an incredible simplicity, modernity and training. \nPogba missed World XI by TWO votes \n\"His staff help him a lot. He is ready to be the best head coach in the world in the future.\" \nAt Monday's awards ceremony, Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo picked up the inaugural Best FIFA Men's Player prize, seeing off competition from old rival Lionel Messi of Barcelona and Atleti's Antoine Griezmann. \n\"It has been a fight for a long time. One year it is for Messi, the next one for Cristiano…But right now, Cristiano deserves the title,\" added Roberto Carlos. \n\"Managers, players and journalists have voted, and I think he deserves it. I hope he enjoys it.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T15:25:15.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
