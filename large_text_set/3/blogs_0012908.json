Called the Note 5 Lite, it’s a smaller and more affordable version of the Note 5 , which was announced last September.\nThe Note 5 Lite sports a 5-inch screen with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels and is powered by the MediaTek MT6735CP chipset. It has 3GB of RAM and comes equipped with a 13MP primary camera as well as a selfie snapper that has an 8MP sensor and LED flash. This is great for all you selfie lovers out there, as you’ll be able to produce better images in low-light conditions. The device also has a fingerprint scanner, which is located on the back.\nThe mid-ranger only has 16GB of storage available for your apps, videos, images, and other data but fortunately, it can be expanded with a microSD card. Its metal body houses a 2,500mAh non-removable battery and is available in the gold or gray color option. It ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow on board with the company’s Cool UI 8.0 user interface on top.\nSee also: Moto G5 Plus launches in India in two memory variants 1 day ago The Coolpad Note 5 Lite will be available exclusively on Amazon India, with sales starting on Tuesday, March 21.
