But on further inspection, of the 91,300 young unemployed and the 30,000 who sought a drug test, only around 100 of that number failed in a one-year period. MORNING REPORT/RNZ \nA leading business group is backing the Prime Minister's suggestion New Zealand needs more immigrants because too many locals rule themselves out of jobs by taking drugs. \nKicking young people when they are down and out, and by \"out\" I mean often unhoused, is a nasty, bullying tactic, particularly when it's common knowledge that young New Zealanders are the group least likely to exercise their franchise come election time. \nA country's best resource is its young people and English's marginalisation and blaming of the young unemployed and disenfranchised is shameful when cheap migrant labour has lowered wages, taken away Kiwi jobs, and caused a housing crisis. \nThe electorate is highly sensitive to immigration and its effect on housing shortages and sees National ploughing on with its immigration policy with no solution in sight as inept, out of touch, and bloody-minded. David White Fairfax Media \nPrime Minister Bill English defends his comments on young work seekers and drugs. \nThrowing young Kiwi citizens under the bus to blur the issue and deflect blame away from the Government is a high-risk manoeuvre that will not be viewed favourably by the parents and relatives of struggling young New Zealanders. Ad Feedback \nACT leader David Seymour extrapolated from English's stoner/loser youth accusation by turning his blame on teachers. In an interview on RNZ's Morning Report , Seymour said that teachers were to blame for the lack of skilled workers and unemployment levels, rather than drug-taking. \nSeymour said the system is set up to keep teachers in well-paid jobs, year after year, when those teachers were to blame for turning out students without basic literacy and numeracy skills. Schools which consistently turned out a lousy product should be closed down and their teachers immediately sacked, was the Seymour solution. MORNING REPORT/RNZ \n\"What I hear from employers is that they want to employ younger New Zealanders, any New Zealanders.\" The Labour Leader Andrew Little says employers want WINZ to work with the unemployed to get them work ready. \nBut surely it is the long-in-harness Minister of Education Hekia Parata who is to blame for poor-quality education, rather than some teachers, and some schools? \nWhat is concerning is the psychological effect of the prime minister repeating and making a great meal of the anecdotal complaints about substandard young Kiwis, as if they were set in stone. \nThat generation is our future and the more it is written off and sold to the tax-paying electorate as shiftless, dim and lazy, the more the mantra is believed and the faster our future disappears. \nWe need to take younger generations with us, offer them real hope and provide them the opportunities we had, or they end up as another incarceration statistic, costing the country further. \nThe Government should be looking overseas to America and the Eurozone to take note of the age of the protesters in groups such as Black Lives Matter and the environmental justice movements. The roots of the Occupy movement are in this country and social media can activate activism faster than hiring a hall and putting up posters. \nIt's ironic that the pandering by television networks to dumb down the current affairs in an effort to reach out to younger viewers has not only put off that demographic, but dismayed older ones too. \nWe should be looking at where we are on the world clock as it ticks toward a sixth extinction if we carry on with intensive dairying, building housing and destroying our wetlands, and polluting our waterways. \nBill English has talked about the need for Kiwis to develop resilience and has inferred that the housing shortage and the rise of the homeless are signs of a booming economy. What kind of madness is this talk? \nTourists flood the country and are sold the clean green lie about our unspoilt Down Under utopia as increasing numbers of Kiwis shiver under tarpaulins, shelter in sheds, and try to sleep in cars. \nThe economy might be superficially prosperous but just who is reaping the benefits from dry figures in balanced books as we head into another cold winter. - The Dominion Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:23:49.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
