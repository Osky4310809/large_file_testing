Prepaid meters \nSpeaking through the Ailegun/Burknor Community Youth Development Association, ABCYDA, the residents said the outrageous bills are worsened by irregular power supply. \nABCYDA Chairman, Mr. Agunwa Ugochukwu said the community needs pre-paid meters and constant electricity supply, saying the community has been in total darkness for months, which he said had negatively affected businesses and social lives of the people living in the area. \nNarrating their encounter with the Oke-Afa Unit of IKEDC, he said: “When we demanded for pre-paid meters, they said the exchange rate is high, they also said the areas given pre-paid meters are under Eko Disco. Where is Eko Disco getting the meters from? These people are corrupt; they are making money for themselves, not government and we the youths have decided that we cannot take it any longer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T11:01:29.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
