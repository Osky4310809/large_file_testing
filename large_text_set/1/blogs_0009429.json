Lopez-Sanchez has pleaded not guilty.\nSpero said in his ruling on Friday that the sheriff did not violate state or federal law by prohibiting his deputies from telling immigration officials when an inmate is released. An email to an attorney for Steinle’s family was not immediately returned.\n© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
