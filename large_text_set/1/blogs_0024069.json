They don’t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.”\nBannon, who ran Breitbart until he was tapped to be Trump’s campaign CEO this past summer, labeled reporters of the “elite media” as “outright activists of the Clinton campaign.” Calling himself ‘Darth Vader,’ Bannon also laughed when asked if White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer lost his credibility with the media over his infamous press statement about Trump’s inauguration crowd sizes, calling it a “badge of honor” while saying the press has no integrity or intelligence.\nOver the weekend, Trump said during his CIA visit that he’s in a running war with the media. He also r ipped into the mainstream media during his interview with ABC’s David Muir last night, highlighting the press’s low approval ratings while simultaneously praising Fox News for its coverage.\n[image via screengrab]\n–\nFollow Justin Baragona on Twitter: @justinbaragona\n tips@mediaite.com", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fsteve-bannon-the-media-should-keep-its-mouth-shut-and-just-listen-for-awhile%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Stephen-Bannon-e1472649848595-650x437.jpg&description=Steve%20Bannon%3A%20The%20Media%20Should%20%26%238216%3BKeep%20Its%20Mouth%20Shut%20and%20Just%20Listen%20For%20Awhile%26%238217%3B", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/media/stephen-bannon-trump-news-media.html?_r=0", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fsteve-bannon-the-media-should-keep-its-mouth-shut-and-just-listen-for-awhile%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://twitter.com/#!/justinbaragona"], "published": "2017-01-27T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T00:05:55.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
