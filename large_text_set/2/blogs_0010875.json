By Megan Giller February 16, 2017 Getty Images Your Privacy Rights Canadian Customers \nMaybe you’ve heard of certain celebrities following the Alkaline Diet, an approach to eating that argues changing the alkalinity of your blood can lead to improved health. \nWell, one of the proponents of the diet, Robert Young, is currently facing jail time for practicing without a medical license, according to Health.com. Advertisement \nPrivacy Policy | About Us \nYes, it’s that bad. \nHow’d this all start? In Young’s book “The pH Miracle,” he details his belief that acidity in the blood causes disease. His theory: Through making your system more alkaline (by eating certain foods or undergoing certain treatments), you can reduce disease, lose weight, enhance energy, strengthen your immune system, and improve your digestion and sleep. \nThe straight talk: “If you see anyone saying the pH of your blood is changing, that means they don’t care about accuracy,” says Ellie Krieger, R.D., host of Ellie’s Read Good Food on public television. While your diet can affect the acidity of individual cells and your urine, it won’t change the pH of your blood, says Krieger. She says she hasn’t seen any evidence to substantiate Young’s claims of an alkaline diet aiding weight loss, improving energy, or resulting in any of the other supposed benefits. \n“Your body has a lot of checks and balances set into place in order to make sure that you blood pH stays in a particular range,” says Men’s Health nutrition advisor, Mike Roussell, Ph.D. “The idea that this pH is out of balance due to lifestyle factors is just that, an 'idea.’ It is an idea that was repeated so many times with such conviction that people started to believe it was true. But it isn't. Oftentimes urine pH is used as a serogate but that is very different from blood pH.” \nDespite the lack of evidence that alkalinity is a true barometer of health, the alkaline diet continues to persist. \n“Alkalinity might be a red herring,” Krieger said. “The alkalinity of your diet might affect your health simply because alkaline-producing foods are generally plant-based. Colorful fruits and vegetables that are good for you for about 9 million other reasons.” \nRoussell agrees. \n“The diet promotes eating a lot of vegetables, which is great but it warns against over consumption of protein which is fiction,” he says. Most people haven't optimized their protein intake throughout the day so pulling back on the protein that they are eating is a step in the wrong direction.” \nUltimately, the story of the alkaline diet is a huge lesson, says Krieger. “It’s what happens when you take a concept and turn it into a profit-making machine. A concept that has no context. Within the context of healthy eating, it has a seed of truth. In and of itself, it’s not the answer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T20:04:18.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
