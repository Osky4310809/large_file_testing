I do feel added pressure. Because I feel like when you have a benevolent presence in the White House, it is one thing, and you take a lot of stuff for granted. But when you have Donald Trump in the White House, you have no choice but to step up.” \nShe added, “I am not just afraid for my daughter’s future, I am afraid for us all.
