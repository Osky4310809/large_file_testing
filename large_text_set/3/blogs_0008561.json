So I look forward to being able to play around in that sandbox and see if I can make something of it,” Julie told THR . \nShe added, “There’s a lot of different things floating around in my head and the first thing I’m going to do is not write and take a vacation. And then when I come back on the other side of that I’m going to go back to work.”\nThe Originals ‘ fourth season is set to air on March 17 on the CW.
