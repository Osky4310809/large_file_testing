By: FE Online | New Delhi   1:57 PM Akhilesh Yadav takes jibes at the UP CM, says Yogi Adiyanath is one year older but much behind in work. (PTI) \nTaking jibes at the new chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav while addressing the Samajwadi Party’s national executive meet underway in Lucknow said that the new Chief minister is one year older than me but much behind in terms of work. He reacted to the shudhikaran of the CM House at 5 Kalidas Road and said that he had no problems with that provided the peacocks that had flown in are looked after. \nFurther, he also pointed out that only policemen of one particular caste were being suspended and transferred, and everybody knows that, but it is not being reported. \nSurprisingly, the elders of the party Mulayam Singh Yadav, Shivpal Singh Yadav and Azam Khan were not present in the meeting. This is notwithstanding the fact that Akhilesh Yadav had promised that he would hand over the reins of party back to Mulayam Singh Yadav. There were not part of the deliberations over what went wrong in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. \nAlso watch: \nThe national executive meet of Samajwadi Party began on sombre note in Lucknow today as leaders close to Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav stayed away from the event. Akhilesh Yadav as the president of Samajwadi Party chaired the national executive meet. \nIt may be recalled that the Samajwadi Party’s power struggle had taken a dramatic turn on the New Year’s Day, as chief minister Akhilesh Yadav staged a coup by getting elected the party chief, ousting his father Mulayam Singh Yadav. Akhilesh, whose show of strength had forced Mulayam to take him back after expulsion, dealt a double blow to his 77-year-old father. After that it has been a divided party.
