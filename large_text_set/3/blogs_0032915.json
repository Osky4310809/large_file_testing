It was a dark warning from someone who called himself the \"Watcher ,\" claiming the couple's new home rightfully belonged to him. The Watcher had a terrifying, albeit simple message for the family: Get out. \nNow, the couple's lawyer claims the Watcher has struck againâ€”sending them a letter at the end of February after a new renter moved in that was \"more derogatory and sinister than any of the previous letters,\" the AP reports . But it's hard to imagine anything creepier than what the family received in the past. \n\"Have they found what is in the walls yet?\" one letter read. \"In time they will. I am pleased to know your names and the names now of the young blood you have brought to me.\" \nThe Broadduses, who have young kids, understandably freaked the fuck out when they started hearing from the Watcher and tried to move out ASAP, but under their unfortunate circumstances, they couldn't find anyone who wanted to buy their home . \nThe family then sued the previous owners of their house in 2015, alleging they too had received letters from the Watcher but failed to disclose that pretty important piece of information during the sale. The old owners countersued for defamation, claiming that though they had received a letter, it wasn't threatening, and the media attention they received from the whole Watcher scandal gave them a bad name. \nRecently, the Broadduses filed another suit against the town of Westfield, which has refused to allow the couple to demolish their house and split their property into two lots, on which they could build separate homes. For now, at least, the family is stuck renting out their million-dollar mansion some mysterious stalker insists is his. \n\"All of the windows and doors in [the house] allow me to watch you and track you as you move through the house,\" a previous letter reads. \"Will the young bloods play in the basement. Who has the rooms facing the street? I'll know as soon as you move in. It will help me to know who is in which bedroom then I can plan better.\" \nFollow Drew Schwartz on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:45:32.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
