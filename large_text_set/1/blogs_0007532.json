UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 16 hours ago 5 Journey guitarist Neal Schon said he's hoping the band's classic vocalist Steve Perry will reunite with the gang for a special performance at the Rock Hall induction on April 7 in Brooklyn, New York.Chatting with Eddie Trunk , Neal was asked about current Journey singer Arnel Pineda's comments on how the Rock Hall ceremony finally might give him a chance to see the classic fold ride again.Saying that Arnel is an amazing guy and that he hopes the vocalist's wish will be granted, the 62-year-old guitarist noted:\"I've certainly been open to [a one-off reunion with Steve], all of us have for years. I've made it very, very clear that the door has always been open for Steve to show up if he wants to jam on half the songs, sing one verse or just hang, whatever... We all love the guy!\"We've made some timeless music that's etched in stone at this point. We're all definitely hoping that he'll do something with us.\"I have not spoken to him. I left messages for him, left my number and I asked for him to give me a call because I can't get his number from anybody.Schon concluded: \"We'll see what happens, but the mere fact that he was singing with the Eels last year, that he came out just to start singing again - I thought, 'Wow, that's promising!' We're all hoping he's just come back and start singing. No pressure about doing anything with us.\"Steve Perry hasn't been a member of Journey since 1998. He's turning 68 in two weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T18:13:55.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
