It is hoped Leslie will forge connections with a number of fellow former military commanders who got top jobs under Trump.\nFreeland said on Monday that Canada is proud of being part of the \"very mutually beneficial\" NAFTA and has a strong relationship with Mexico, but she added the country's trade ties with the U.S. are \"primarily bilateral.\"\nStephen Schwarzman, an adviser to the Trump administration, said Trudeau should not be \"enormously worried\" about any overhaul to trade agreements.\nSpeaking in Calgary where he met with Trudeau and his cabinet, Schwarzman emphasized the U.S. is primarily concerned with trade deals that involve big imbalances.\nThat still carries some cause for concern for David MacNaughton, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., who says the country could become \"collateral damage\" as Washington resets relationships with some of its trading partners.\n\"We will co-operate on trilateral matters when it's in our interest and we'll be looking to do things that are in our interest bilaterally,\" MacNaughton said. \"Some of them may be within NAFTA and some of them may not be.\"\nWith files from The Canadian Press\nLike Us On Facebook\nAlso on HuffPost:\nClose  7 Things You Didn't Know About George H W Bush of   \"...
