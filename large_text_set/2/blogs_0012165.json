The wall walkout, for example, forces you to maintain a strong and stable position in your shoulders and core as you walk your hands from the overhead position to a plank position. Strengthen and stabilize your shoulder girdle from varying angles and you'll bulletproof your shoulders, adds Velasquez. \nYou'll also get some serious ab work from core stability and endurance requirements throughout the complex. \nDirections: Perform the exercises below in the order listed: \n1. Half-kneeling kettlebell press, 10 reps per side \n2. Dumbbell snatch, 8 reps per side \nRest for 30 seconds. \n3. Wall walkout, 10 reps \n4. Miniband lateral bear crawl, 10 reps per side \n5. Plate lateral raise, 10 per side \nRest 60 seconds. That's 1 round. Do 3 full rounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:53:29.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
