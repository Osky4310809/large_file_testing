Not to sound TOO gushy, but the love between Cheryl and One Direction’s Liam Payne continues to make us melt; remember how they met when Liam was auditioning as a solo artist on The X Factor ? Then he went and got all famous and everything, and now they’re just the sweetest couple who send impossibly cute joint Christmas cards . But back to the photo shoot.\nI am proud to announce that I am one of fifteen ambassadors working with @PrincesTrust & LOreal Paris UK to help thousands of young people turn self-doubt into self-worth. The \"All Worth It\" Confidence training program starts now! Link in my bio #ALLWORTHIT #PRINCESTRUSTLOREAL \nA post shared by Cheryl (@cherylofficial) on Feb 23, 2017 at 12:03am PST \nLook closely. There she is fourth from the right. We LOVE how Cheryl chose this platform for a maternity photo shoot, because it promotes the “All Worth It” confidence training program which is designed to empower young people . She’s about to become a mom for the first time, but her agenda is still about how best to inspire others.\nhttps://t.co/CQbzcONrDr #allworthit pic.twitter.com/Tc3JsvA41X \n— Cheryl (@CherylOfficial) February 23, 2017 And this goes without saying, but we are ridiculously excited for Cheryl and Liam’s baby to be born! We know Liam is going to be a great dad…because he’s Liam!\nMorning jog \nA post shared by Liam Payne (@liampayne) on Dec 20, 2016 at 12:44am PST \nWishing the happy couple all the best as they continue to prepare for parenthood, and um, feel free to do more photo shoots!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:37:11.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
