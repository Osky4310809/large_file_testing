Are they any different than the erstwhile Lumia smartphones? By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: February 27, 2017 1:59 PM MWC 2017: While this is a comeback of sorts for Nokia, earlier, the company had tried its hand with global tech giant Microsoft, to jump on the smartphone bandwagon with Lumia devices, but in vain. (Source: Reuters) \nHMD Global has brought Nokia back into the smartphone game with three new Android devices. At the Mobile World Congress (MWC 2017), HMD Global launched the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 smartphones and they all run the stock Android operating system. Nokia also brought back the iconic Nokia 3310 handset. While this is a comeback of sorts for Nokia, which was once a pioneer in mobile technology. Earlier, the company had tried its hand with global tech giant Microsoft , to jump into the smartphone bandwagon but in vain. The foray with Windows OS was a miserable failure. Now, it is trying aggressively to enter the mobile phone market by bringing smartphones as well as feature phones. The premium Nokia smartphones, overall have the look and feel of Lumia devices but on the software front it has gone for Android Nougat, and will also contain the Google Assistant. So, how different are the Nokia Android phones from the erstwhile Lumia phones? \nNokia’s latest devices look very modern and appear to be looking into the future. These smartphones have the body and feel reminiscent of the Nokia school of design, which gives the Finnish legacy company more than a chance to compete with the rivals. It has done away with Microsoft Windows and embraced the Android experience which has worldwide appeal. The smartphones also come at price points which will be noticed all over the world. Nokia, this time is not taking its customers for granted. Despite playing the nostalgia game and depending on its legacy, Nokia knows that it has to start from the scratch. While Nokia could have introduced more innovative technologies in its devices, but clearly it is banking on its design and quality initially, thereby building the trust it had lost. This does not necessarily mean that Nokia will stop innovating. This is showcased by the fact that it has offered a metallic body on its smartphones and that too at really competitive prices. This move is a refreshing change from the Lumia smartphones which had plastic bodies. However, the Nokia 3 is made from a block of aluminium, and the rear end is coated in polycarbonate. It reminds us of the Lumia 800 device which was the company’s first popular Windows Phone back in the year 2011. \nGiving up on Windows, Nokia also has taken on other rival companies with its simple idea in Android. Nokia, with what it calls ‘unique take on Android’ is offering its users the OS in its purest form which also will get all the updates. The pure Android experience is a masterstroke by Nokia as the OS was one of the main reasons Nokia brand failed with Microsoft. Apart from this, Nokia appears to have strengthened the security and privacy settings, which in an earlier era might not have been a big deal from the consumer point of view, but now with so many cyber crimes making news, Nokia can easily bank on people’s trust that went missing with Lumia. Moreover, while Lumia was all about taking the consumer for granted, the new Nokia smartphones will lure in young consumers who have never used the brand before.
