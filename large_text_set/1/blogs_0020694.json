We won’t give up that interest for the sake of strict procedural requirements.\" \nDastis position goes against the beliefs of many of Brussels' key officials tasked with negotiating Brexit. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, has consistently maintained that both sides must agree the full terms of the UK's separation before they can start discussing a future trade deal. \nSpain's foreign minister was also clear that he doesn't want to \"punish\" the UK for leaving the EU, something many have suggested could occur in negotiations. \n\"We don’t see this as a battle in which one side has to come out as the victor and the other as the vanquished,\" he told the FT. \n\"I don’t see any intention to be punitive.\" \n\"Our priority is to preserve the unity of the EU,\" Dastis continued, and to preserve the fundamental principles of the European project.\" \n\"At the same time, we want to preserve a close relationship with the UK. We think that is possible.\" \nThe Spanish minister's comments come at the same time as Prime Minister Theresa May is about to embark on a visit to meet newly elected US President Donald Trump for the first time, and to discuss a post-Brexit trade deal. \nBoth parties are keen to strike a deal as quickly as possible, with one reporting suggesting Trump aides have told May that the two countries could \"do a trade deal in a week,\" although that seems incredibly unlikely given the enormous complexities of agreeing international trade agreements. \nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T17:47:46.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
