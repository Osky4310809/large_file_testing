The implications of this and the magnitude to which it derails efforts of anyone to rise to the top of a system that is in total decay from its total decadence have not been realized by the majority of Americans!!!Anyone attempting to invent anything is subjected to their inventions being stolen by our government and sold to the many corporations that they serve! \nIf Donald is dumb enough to leave the existing standing alphabet-soup agencies in place without any intervention or attempt to shut them the fuck down he's gonna have no one but himself to blame when they move against him. \nYou're gonna be POTUS, Don. Deal with these asshats. Be a goddamned CEO and fire some people.

I'm surprised they didn't work in \"urinate\" and \"prostitute\". If it weren't for the fact that Glenn Greenwald published his Snowden pieces in the Guardian, I'd tell the Guardian to crouch down and lick my nut sack. \nI doubt this was really presented in the FISA court. FISA court's biggest yearly expense is to the Amalgamated Rubber Stamp Factory, Inc. They've never seen an unjustified warrant, nope. Fuck, they probably allowed six warrants on me alone. I'm sure the number of warrants granted by FISA on Trump's team numbers in the thousands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T06:36:56.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
