Such stories were rampant in our grandparents' generation, where if one died, the other would follow soon. \"They were so used to each other,\" we would say. Turns out, lovers dying together goes beyond the two of them simply being accustomed to each other. The stress caused by the death of a loved one, or a traumatic event, or otherwise chronic stress is called Broken Heart Syndrome, and is a common presentation in the doctor's clinic. Also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or stress cardiomyopathy, it is usually a temporary condition where the heart takes a beating due to a high level of stress hormones, such as adrenalin, in the body. The symptoms are similar to a heart attack, and include chest pain, difficulty breathing, and irregular heartbeat. In some cases, the muscle weakness in the heart can also lead to congestive heart failure. So, yes, you can indeed die from a broken heart. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy derives its name from an octopus trap, and was first discovered in Japan. More than 80% of the cases recorded have been of women. But, those of us in our 20s and 30s, and stuck in this cycle of love and loss, don't have all that much to worry about. It is most commonly seen in an older age group, specifically women who have reached menopause. That said, high stress levels do impact the body no matter what your age may be (read more about this on our website, here ). In the wake of a breakup or a loss of any kind, it is important to take care of yourself, and let your mind, body, and soul heal. Broken Heart Syndrome can be fatal, yes. But, in most cases, it is a reversible condition. In some cases, grief manifests itself in less threatening ways like a lowered immunity and subsequently, susceptibility to cold and fever, or body aches, or psychological issues such as depression and anxiety. Regardless of how your aching heart puts itself forward, it is imperative that you put balm on it, and nurture it back to health.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T16:05:56.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
