Some mums haven't claimed any child benefit at all (Photo: Getty) \nAs a result, it is claimed many mothers who have started a family since the changes have not bothered to claim child benefit at all. \nBut Royal London have highlighted that this means mothers are missing out on National Insurance credits which go towards their state pension. \nThis could cost them about £231 per year or thousands of pounds over the course of retirement. \nStatistics cited by Royal London show that before the 2013 changes the number of families in receipt of child benefit was going up every year since 2007. \nSince the change the number of families claiming has been in decline. \nRoyal London estimates that the number of mothers missing out on credits towards their state pension has doubled in the last two years and now stands at about 50,000.
