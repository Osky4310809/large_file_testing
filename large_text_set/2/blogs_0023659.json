The secret? Trainer Sarah Kusch uses full body movements that challenge your body while blasting calories. Expect non-traditional movements on every plane, including standing lateral crunches and planks with a tuck. Oh, and these moves will really get your heart rate up, so you're going to want to grab a towel. \nWorkout Details \nStart with a dynamic warm-up to boost blood flow and protect your muscles. Then, move into standing lateral crunches, squats with toe taps, and squat walk-outs with rows, and burn up your abs with flutter clicks. Change to weightless windmills, more squats with side crunches, a plank with elbow taps, and starfishes to bump up your heart rate. Change to reach and pulls, standing kickbacks, and sumo squats to tiptoes for your glutes, then standing high-knee crunch, frog squats, and forward curtsies. You'll finish doing squats with side reaches and a plank with tucks. \nAbout Grokker Interested in more at-­home workout video classes?
