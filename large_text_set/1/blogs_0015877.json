Read more \nThe Royal Navy saw 50 sailors and marines caught in 2016, a rise of 20 from the previous 12 months. \nApart from cocaine, ecstasy, and cannabis use, 50 soldiers tested positive for banned steroids. \nIn a unit-by-unit breakdown, the Scottish infantry regiments registered 90 failed tests and the Royal Engineers, which is composed of a number of regiments, recorded 110. \nAmong the worst offenders in terms of individual units were the red-coated Foot Guards, best known for guarding the Queen at Buckingham Palace. Figures indicate that 80 guardsmen tested positive over the last two years. \nAs recently as September last year, mobile phone footage emerged of a major and a captain from the Coldstream Guards apparently snorting cocaine off a ceremonial sword. \nThe men were identified by the Mirror as Major James Coleby, a decorated Afghanistan and Iraq war veteran who once escorted French President Francois Hollande on a troop inspection, and Captain Alex Ritchie. \nThe 30-second video shows Ritchie racking up a line of a powdery substance on a ceremonial sword before asking Colesby, who is swaying nearby: “ How much? Two inches? You want two inches of that? If you get rid of that I’ll be mightily impressed. ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T16:50:26.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
