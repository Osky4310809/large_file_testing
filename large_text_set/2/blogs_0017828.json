Now we don't have any obstacles stopping them,\" Summit Academy principal Cheryl Lundy Swift said. \"This means the sky is the limit.\" \nSummit Academy, which — according to school founder Natasha Campbell — is located in a neighborhood where only 4 percent of the adult population have college degrees, sent 93 percent of its previous graduating class to college. \n\"We’re working to get 100 percent of our scholars to college this year,\" Campbell said on \"The Ellen Show.\" \nShe first reached out to DeGeneres in a letter describing her school's mission and successes. The TV host invited Campbell and Swift onto her show earlier month, stunning the educators with a $25,000 check from Walmart for their institution. \nShe asked them to return with their students, who shrieked, wept tears of joy and hugged one another and DeGeneres when she delivered news of their scholarships. \nWatch their heartwarming reactions in the clip below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:58:14.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
