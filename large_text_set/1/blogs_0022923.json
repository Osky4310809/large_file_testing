If you’re like me, you’re literally vibrating with a desire to do something more, something right now . \nWell, here’s something you can this very instant: Donate to Democrat Jon Ossoff , an investigative filmmaker and former congressional staffer who’s running in a special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. That’s the seat that’ll soon be vacated by Rep. Tom Price, Trump’s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services—and dismantle Obamacare, brick by brick. \nBut something rather amazing happened in this seat in November: It rebelled against Trump. While voters in this suburban Atlanta district backed Mitt Romney by a hefty 61-37 margin four years ago, Trump won it by just a single point. This is a conservative area, no doubt about it, but if Democrats can link the GOP to Trump here, Ossoff—who’s been endorsed by Georgia Reps. John Lewis and Hank Johnson—could pull off a stunning upset. \nThe election hasn’t been scheduled yet, though it could happen as soon as April. But there’s no time to wait. This will be a very difficult race (you can read more background on it here ), but we could send an extraordinary message if we win, so GIVE NOW .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T02:36:14.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
