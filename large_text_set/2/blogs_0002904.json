After ‘PERFECT’ , ‘NAAM’ , ‘VIP’ , and ‘GT’ from last year (and the ‘PATRIOT’ plates from 2015), Malaysians looking for unique plates will be able to bid for RIMAU 1 to RIMAU 9999. \nWhat’s RIMAU about? Malaysia will be hosting the 2017 SEA Games for the ASEAN region this year, and RIMAU is the name of the games’ Malayan Tiger mascot. RIMAU stands for Respect, Integrity, Move, Attitude and Unity. The SEA Games commemorative number plates are being released by the Ministry of Youth and Sports (KBS) via the Road Transport Department (JPJ). \nAccording to the “RIMAU PLAT” Facebook page set up to promote the special plate series, e-bidding for numbers will open in March. Our source from JPJ has confirmed the authenticity of the RIMAU plate series, which is legit. Tiger number plates anyone? Danny Tan loves driving as much as he loves a certain herbal meat soup, and sweet engine music as much as drum beats. He has been in the auto industry since 2006, previously filling the pages of two motoring magazines before joining this website. Enjoys detailing the experience more than the technical details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:00:39.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
