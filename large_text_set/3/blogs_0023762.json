Their fans' generosity to a nearby foodbank helping locals get by Magpies midfielder Isaac Hayden has been lending a hand at centre feeding 750 people a week thanks to the Toon Army Share “It’s a special thing the fans have done” believes Hayden (left) of the food collections (Photo: Newcastle United/Getty) Share Get   Thank you for subscribing!   \nA mile and a half from St James’ Park, midfielder Isaac Hayden is dishing out sausage, mash and cups of tea. \nOne of the recipients is called Michael. \nA couple of years ago he was a Newcastle United season ticket holder, until illness struck. \nHe lost his job, after 16 years as a landscape gardener. \nMoney troubles drove him into debt and poverty, and that’s why he turned up here at the West End Food Bank. \nOrdinarily, there would be no obvious link between the gleaming football temple of St James’ Park, and a pocket of Newcastle where 3,000 ­families fall within the most ­deprived 0.5 per cent in the country. \nHead east along Benwell Lane and players earning £30,000-plus a week live in a different world to Michael, in need of £30-a-week food handouts to keep his two kids fed. \nBut Toon fans have created the unlikely bond. The Toon midfielder makes a brew at the Benwell Lane foodbank (Photo: Newcastle United/Getty) \nBefore three home games, fans have collected food. They’ve mobilised, promoted, cajoled — and it’s worked. \nThe response has been overwhelming: 3.2 tonnes ­before the Derby match. Next home game, Bristol City, 2.3 tonnes. Last time, before ­Fulham visited, 2.7 tonnes. \nDonations from each home game have kept the food bank running for a week. \nThat means 750 people, half of them children, get ­either a food parcel or a hot meal each week. \nThis is a part of town Hayden’s never seen before, but ­volunteered to visit to recognise the collections ­organised by the Newcastle United ­Supporters’ Trust and ­promoted by the fanzine­, True Faith . \nHe said: “I get my hair cut at the top of the hill on ­Westgate Road. I’ve never been this side. It is incredible the contrast you see in a mile and a half.” \nMike Nixon, who runs the food bank, says it is a story of hope, not dependence. (Photo: Newcastle United/Getty) \nSome 60 per cent of folk who ask for help only need the charity safety net once. \nFour in 10 have had problems ­receiving their benefits. ­Others have got into debt. \nNine out of 10 of those helped are on their way again after three visits, and don’t return. \nThere is a hardcore of 10 per cent who need regular ­visits. \n“They get more than a meal. It is social interaction, warmth, out of isolation,” said Nixon. \n“It’s a special thing the fans have done,” believes Hayden. “They organise and give to people not so ­fortunate. It is good to be here because it keeps you humble. You have to keep a ­connection between fans, players and the city. You can drive here a mile from St James’ Park, and it is a ­different world from the life inside that stadium. \n“As a player, you can go to Darras Hall and see the big houses, Jesmond too, and you come out here and it is very different. We are in a very privileged position doing what we love. It brings rewards and makes us very lucky. We know there are people less fortunate and we’d like to help.” Tonnes of food have been donated at each of three home games in recent weeks (Photo: Newcastle United/Getty) \nOne mystery star did help at Christmas, pulling up in his Range Rover, his wife unloaded food and brought in £400 cash. \nHayden said: “Football can be more than football. It can be used to help people. I’d love to hear more ideas. One idea works like this, and it opens up endless possibilities. \n“Footballers come from all backgrounds. But we all know life can change quickly. One minute you can be playing at St James’ Park, the next you can get an injury and be ­finished. Same in any job. \n“There are stories here that give hope. It helps people in need, gives them a leg up to get back to their normal lives. I imagine people can feel ­embarrassed or feel bad to come here but, if you need help, you can reach out and find somewhere comfortable to get it. \n“It is people-skills here too. If you lose your job, you can lose that. This is a chance to meet others and talk and see others with similar problems.” Hayden insists there is more to today's footballers than big cars and flash watches (Photo: Newcastle United/Getty) \nHayden grew up in Essex with parents who gave him “a simple good life, the best start. A quiet area, no bad kids.” \nHe is only 22, but has ­opinions on the “divide” ­between footballers and ­“everyday people”. \nHe said: “Footballers tend not to get political, but I know team-mates who’d be interested in this. There are a few in the game who want to be flash – big cars, watches. You might see 10 per cent like that. It can paint the wrong picture, ­before you get to know the person. \n“Until you sit down with a team-mate you don’t know what they are like. They can be flashy or arrogant, whatever, but I have found in our dressing room no one is really like that. In this city you have to be as grounded as ­possible.” \nMichael, the former season ticket holder, said: “I used to love going to St James’ Park. To me it never mattered if they won or lost. It was just a great escape. \n\"I watch for their results now. Rafa the Gaffer is doing the job. I’d love them to go up. \n\"I doubt I’ll ever get back in.” Newcastle's results may put smiles on faces but they don't put meals in bellies (Photo: Getty) \nHayden helped the volunteers shift some food crates as the lunchtime rush subsided. \n“I’d better not put my back out!” he said. “We’ve got seven games in April. We’ve got the chance to make history. Fans remember players who get you promoted. Who wouldn’t want to be in this position? Eight games to win the league.” \nBut as Hayden has ­witnessed, there are heroic ­efforts being made to lift the city just down the road from St James’ Park too. \n* newcastlewestend.foodbank.org.uk; nust.org.uk; true-faith.co.uk \nNext collection: Opposite Nine bar, Gallowgate End, before the Wigan game on Saturday April 1 .
