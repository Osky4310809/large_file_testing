Now Bharti Airtel, the country’s biggest telecom operator, has announced the same. The company today announced that it will now offer free incoming and outgoing calls while roaming nationally to its subscribers starting April 1st. \nAll Airtel users, travelling anywhere in the country, will not have to pay any extra charges on incoming / outgoing calls and SMSes. With this, Airtel users will be able to carry their numbers across the country and won’t have to pay higher call charges starting April 1st. Also, there won’t be any additional data charges on national roaming. \nAs for the international roaming charges, Airtel has already launched a few international roaming packs for all major countries across the globe. These packs are available as one day, ten-day and 30-day packs. Airtel says that this allows its users to use their devices abroad without any fear of high roaming charges. Airtel has also said that it will allow protection from bill shock to those who roam internationally without subscribing to any pack. This will be done t hrough an automatic adjustment equal to the daily pack for that particular country. So when a customer’s billing reaches the price of a one-day pack for the country, he/she will be moved to that pack automatically. Even after the exhaustion of pack benefits, subscribers can avail attractive rates for calling and data usage. Call c harges have been reduced by upto 90 percent to Rs 3 per minute, and data charges by up to 99 percent to Rs 3 per MB across popular roaming destinations.Clearly, Airtel’s move comes as another salvo in its war against Reliance Jio. In any case, it’s the subscribers that are reaping the benefits, so we aren’t complaining.
