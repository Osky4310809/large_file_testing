However, there’s nothing special about the dock that charges it and enables it to be played on a television. Lacking any kind of extra processing power, the Switch dock is little more than a piece of plastic. The Switch dock was too boring for one modder who decided to fashion a new dock out of a classic Nintendo console.\nYouTube and Reddit user Tettzan Zone uploaded a video that shows one of the coolest constructions we’ve ever seen. He took a broken down Nintendo 64 system and turned it into a dock for the Nintendo Switch. This custom dock works exactly like the regular one. The only real difference is that the Joy-con controllers cannot be slid onto the system while it is docked. Other that, this setup works remarkably well.\nPrior to this, Tettzan uploaded a video where he showed off another custom dock . It appears he took the main piece of that build and stuck it into the back of the custom N64 dock. Another change is with the controller ports. Instead of the original N64 ones, these controller ports are standard USB ports. An N64 controller would be useless here, so utilizing UBS connections makes a lot of sense.\nTettzan will upload a more detailed construction video later this week. This is great news for those of us who are curious about how this all works. This is also great for those who may want to create their own custom Switch dock. Perhaps we’ll eventually see other classic Nintendo consoles converted like this in the future. Imagine a custom NES dock where you can insert the Switch the way you would an old NES cartridge. You can’t tell me that wouldn’t be awesome. Somebody out there, please make that happen!\nBuy it now!
