(Everyone cared.) \nCompletely wiped, Corinne took a casual mid-date catnap on a nearby couch before rejoining the other women and bragging about her nanny, Raquel. The women masked their jealousy with horror that a 24-year-old has someone to do her laundry and cut up her cucumbers, a.k.a. The Dream. \nBSB dancing queen Danielle L. got the group date rose. PHOTOS: Biggest Reality TV Villains Ever! \nNick Actually Does Make a Woman \"Throw Up Everywhere\" \nVanessa was chosen for this week’s one-on-one date — a Zero-G flight that simulated space-like conditions and allowed Nick and Vanessa to wear incredible astronaut jumpsuits. \nThey were just a “couple of kids having a great time taking in this very unique experience together,” as Nick eloquently put it, but one flip too many caused Vanessa’s stomach to turn and she ended up face-deep in a barf bag. Not a problem for Nick, who cuddled her and kissed her cheek mid-vomit, then went in for a mouth-kiss after it was over. “Still tastes fine,” he assessed. This is modern love. \nOver dinner, Vanessa and Nick bonded over family, and Nick cried because Vanessa made him feel “less terrified” and “very optimistic.” She wiped his tears and accepted his rose. Dominique, Brittany, Jaimi, Nick Viall, Rachel, Sarah, Alexis and Astrid Rick Rowell/ABC \nThe Girls Run Around and Nick Avoids a Runaround \nRachel, Alexis, Astrid, Jaimi, Sarah, Brittany and Dominique received a date card, which read, “I’m done playing the field.” (An interesting promise for the Bachelor to make, but we’ll let it slide.) \nThe women dressed in their cutest athleisure and met Nick on a track, where Olympic athletes Allyson Felix , Carl Lewis and Michelle Carter led them in a Nick-themed decathlon. Astrid won the “Nickathlon” overall and was awarded hot-tub time with Nick. \nWhile everyone was literally all fun and games, Dominique spent the day upset about the lack of attention Nick had given her. That night, she came in hot and told Nick, in the spirit of honesty, that she didn’t feel like he was giving her a fair shot. Nick dumped her right then and there, citing that their relationship wasn’t as far along as the others. To be fair, this was her first date with Nick. \nNick rejoined the other women and told them he sent Dominique home, then gave the group date rose to Rachel. PHOTOS: 'The Bachelor' Season 21: See Which Former Contestants Are Lookalikes With Nick Viall’s New Ladies? \nA Typical Bachelor Pool Party \nNick canceled the cocktail party ahead of the rose ceremony in favor of a pool party. “Beautiful women parading in bikinis and sipping cocktails … What could go wrong?” Nick (probably) wondered. \nAnd for a minute, it was heaven! The women encircled Nick as he took his shirt off, Raven lathered sunscreen onto his abs, Jasmine kissed him all over while he blushed — and then, what’s this? Another surprise from Corinne! His “fun and playful” girl got him a bouncy castle! \nBut it all came crashing when the other women peeked in on the bouncy castle and saw the resident villain straddling their man. When Corinne went inside for her now-standard nap, one woman after another confronted Nick about her Corinne concerns. \nVanessa, who already had a date rose, laid into Nick the hardest, flatly asking, “Are you looking for a wife? Are you looking for someone to f--k around with? Because at that point, I’d rather you just not give me a rose.” \nWe’re very curious to see how Nick talks his way out of this one… The Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. \nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!
