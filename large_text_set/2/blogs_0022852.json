It's just cruel.\nTake Luke Taylor, who caught vision of these dolphins hanging out at Tallow Beach, near Byron Bay, Australia on Feb. 17. The creatures can be seen swimming and jumping alongside the surfers.\nSEE ALSO: Sir David Attenborough is back and 2017 is finally starting to look up\n\"It was so magical to see them so calm & joyful in their own habitat with all the surfers around them,\" Taylor wrote in the video's description . Dare to dream.\nOver in Kaikoura, New Zealand, a group of jet skiers recently found themselves surrounded by a family of orcas while out on the water.\nThe orcas can be seen travelling alongside each other in a Facebook video by Boardsilly surf and sup adventures, as thrilled onlookers watch on.\nSurf instructor Dave Lyons told the Kaikoura Star he'd never seen that many Orca before. He estimated there were about 30 spread over an area of 3 kilometres (1.8 miles).\n\"There was the mum one side, and the dad on the other. We never got close to him but he was huge â€” his fin was enormous,\" he told the newspaper. \"All the pups were playing, it was just so amazing.\"\nNew Zealand is home to only an estimated 150 to 200 individual orcas, according to the Department of Conservation , which makes this a rare sight. However, the department notes a vessel should not be closer than 50 metres (54 yards) to an orca.\nSo sure, go see some whales instead of wailing (silently) in your office. Just remember to be respectful, folks.\nBONUS: Oscars contender 'La La Land' gets an old school video game treatment", "external_links": ["http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/nz/89582933/huge-pod-of-orca-delights-jetskiers-off-the-kaikoura-coast", "https://www.facebook.com/boardsillysurfsup/videos/10154320364607544/", "https://youtu.be/hOMgvBikAU0", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/zSxI3gBM.m3u8", "http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/marine-mammals/dolphins/killer-whale-orca/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/zSxI3gBM.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T11:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:39:28.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
