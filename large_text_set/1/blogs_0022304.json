The funky and fast-casual taco joint is joining the Domain Northside, where it aims to deliver a fresh take on the ubiquitous taco. Think over twenty different tacos, including globe-trotting varieties from shrimp and grits to spicy tikka chicken to Cuban pig. Itâ€™s similar to new school taco joint Fork & Taco, which closed down last December. Brunch-influenced tacos like the barbacoa brisket and egg frittata are served all day, along with a rotating taco special each week. Bonus: Vegetarians can dine without compromise. Velvet Taco offers three veggie tacos including hot and crisp tofu, fried paneer, and falafel. The sides menu is small but mighty from its riff on elotes to fried egg-adorned crispy tots to a red curry coconut queso. Save room for the velvet cake for dessert. Notably, nearly everything is made in-house, including the corn tortillas, slow-roasted rotisserie chicken and corn, and margaritas made with fresh fruit. Velvet Taco fans swear by the restaurant's Backdoor Chicken deal. Simply knock on the back door of a Velvet Taco and ask for the $20 special, a whole slowly-roasted rotisserie chicken, six tortillas (corn or flour), two sides of elote-style corn with crema, homemade Heat Sauce and fresh pico de gallo. To satiate late-night taco cravings, the restaurant at 11421 Rock Rose Boulevard will be open Sunday to Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m., Thursday 10 a.m. to 3 a.m., and Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 a.m. In addition to its Dallas location, Velvet Taco has outposts in Fort Worth, Houston, and Chicago. Velvet Taco is now hiring for both front and back of house positions at the upcoming Austin location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T09:16:28.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
