Only 51 percent of Democrats held that opinion. Republicans and Democrats are about equally likely to believe in UFOs . \nAmericans were unsure if aliens would be friendly to humanity, with 29 percent suspecting they would be, while 19 percent suspected any alien life would be hostile. Roughly 12 percent of U.S. adults believe that the government has already made contact with aliens, but is covering up that fact. \nThe poll was conducted in late February from a representative sample of 2,008 U.S. adults. \nWhen pollsters surveyed the group about surveying the seven planets around the TRAPPIST-1 solar system for aliens , 40 percent of Americans think the planets likely contain some form of extra-terrestrial life, while only 16 percent thought they probably don’t.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:20:29.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
