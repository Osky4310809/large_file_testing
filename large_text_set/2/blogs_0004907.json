When pressed for examples, the White House last night released a list of 78 incidents it called terrorism that it says were overlooked by U.S. national media. That list—one full of puzzling spelling errors like “ATTAKER,” “DENMAKR,” and “BERNADINO”—included an attack of which the in-depth coverage won the L.A. Times a Pulitzer . Advertisement \nIn the above video, you can see 75 of those incidents being covered by U.S. national media—despite many of them fitting a very questionable definition of “terrorism.” In some cases, investigating authorities have directly ruled out terrorism while in others the acts are more akin to being direct warfare than terror. Regardless, only three of the items on Trump’s list did not earn broad coverage from the U.S. national media: \nEL GORA, EGYPT \nTARGET: No casualties; airfield used by MFO attacked with rockets \nATTAKER: Unidentified ISIL-Sinai operatives \nWe were unable to verify that this incident actually happened. Several minor attacks at the El Gora (or El Gorah, or Al Jura, or Al-Jurah) airport appear on Trump’s list, but this incident only exists on the Internet in reports yesterday of Trump releasing this list.
