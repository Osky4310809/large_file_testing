And when you talk to Ellen you almost always end up gushing about your significant other. Hadid was more than happy to talk about her relationship with the former One Direction singer. \nThe model explained how she met Malik, 24, at a friends birthday party about a year and a half ago. The meeting quickly turned into a date. \n\"We played it cool for about 10 minutes,\" Hadid said. \"Then I was like, 'You're really cute.'\" \n\"We connected really quickly,\" she added. \"We kind of have the same sense of humor, and just started sharing videos.\" \nHadid has publicly declared her affection for Malik before, with many photos on social media and even a note in June showing support after he was forced to cancel a show due to anxiety. \n\"Your bravery in those times makes me proud,\" she wrote. \"Love you and so proud of you always.\" \nHadid also talked to DeGeneres about her new line, TommyXGigi, which she premiered Wednesday night at Tommy Hilfiger's extravagant show in Los Angeles . The items were available for purchase as soon as the show was over, and as DeGeneres helpfully informed Hadid, they've already sold out. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
