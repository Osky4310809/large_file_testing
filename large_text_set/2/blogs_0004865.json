Tech. student walked-in a couple days back, looking all curious. I offered him a seat. “It’s okay Sir”, he said. “I just need a minute of your time. What is Entrepreneurship Sir?’’ There was no way I was going to answer that question in a minute. I forced Amit to take a seat. Amit’s question in 2017 transported my mind back to 1988, over a decade before he was born.\nAs a rookie entrepreneurship trainer accredited by Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India, I was earnestly searching for ‘youngsters’ with ‘high N-Ach’ to train them as entrepreneurs. My honest (and innocent) belief was that only youngsters with high need for achievement could become entrepreneurs. And entrepreneurship meant starting a ‘business’ venture ‘making’ something that was not made before; or at least making it in a manner not done before.\nNeedless to say that lot of water has flown under the bridge since then. Times have changed and I am wiser. Most of the words put in Quote: marks above started losing criticality along the way. I have met people like Dr. Rajiv Kumar turning entrepreneurs after sixty, much like a Ray Kroc; I have wondered at people like Harsh Dafrey doing it after achieving everything there was to achieve and I have engaged with youngsters like Abhishek Kawitkar doing the same things in social ventures rather than in businesses. While Abhishek is not making anything at Treepublic, he is making a change.\nWithout fitting the stereotype of my earlier concept, all of them exhibit exact same thinking that I associated with entrepreneurship. They demonstrate exact same grit to overcome obstacles and they have all devised innovative strategies to succeed. After witnessing all this, my understanding of entrepreneurship had to undergo a sea change.\nI have long since unshackled entrepreneurship from its default association with business. I am no more a purist. What’s more, I even dissociated entrepreneurship from creating one’s own organisation; a virtual sacrilege!\nWhile starting a new student club on campus, I felt as much like an entrepreneur as I did while setting-up a paints factory at Coimbatore. I felt as much like an entrepreneur when I launched a new academic programme as I did when I established a restaurant at Pune. To me, entrepreneurship is not an activity; it’s a mindset coupled with a skillset.\nThe moment I started approaching it as a mindset, I started seeing entrepreneurship in all spheres of life; including but not restricted to business. Despite being an employee most of my working life, I acquired and applied the entrepreneurial mindset (and skillset) somewhere along the way. I had intently listened to entrepreneurs sharing exciting stories of their ventures; my own stories of jobs didn’t sound different anymore. There was the same spotting of problems or opportunities, there was the same selling of ideas to multiple stakeholders, there was the same mobilisation of resources, there were the same proverbial setbacks along the way and then there were the same definite rewards in the form of fulfilment.\nAll the superhumanness attached to entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship was actually becoming a hurdle in its spread. The huge amount of romanticism around entrepreneurship was making it sound improbable rather than doable. Heroes were being glorified rather than role models being offered. The whole thing served no purpose. It was time to take a fresh look at the approach. Unshackling the concept worked beautifully for me. Now there was no need to be a superhuman to be an entrepreneur; it was enough to feel like one. There was no need to start an enterprise to be an entrepreneur; it was enough to act like one in any organisation. Simply put, there was no need to be an entrepreneur to be entrepreneurial.\nAs Stewart Thornhill once said, “The difference between an entrepreneur and a non-entrepreneur is the simple act of starting.” I have very conveniently inferred it as starting anything!\nAmit left after my thirty-minute answer to his one-minute question; I am not sure convinced or confused.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T14:34:17.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
