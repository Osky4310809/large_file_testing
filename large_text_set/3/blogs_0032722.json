Native Americans rally against Dakota Access Pipeline in Washington \n\"The trend also threatens to jeopardise one of the United States' constitutional pillars: free speech,\" they said in a statement, calling for action to reverse such legislation. \n\"From the Black Lives Matter movement, to the environmental and Native American movements in opposition to the Dakota Access oil pipeline, and the Women's Marches, individuals and organisations across [American] society have mobilised in peaceful protests,\" Kiai and Kaye said. \nThe UN experts said it was Americans' fundamental right to protest, but the bills in Republican-governed states such as Indiana, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Missouri sought to stop them exercising that right. \nSeveral bills proposed in Colorado, North Dakota, and Oklahoma targeted opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota and would have \"a chilling effect on environmental protesters\", the experts said. \nLast month, dozens of armed US law enforcement officers swept through a protest camp near the site of the pipeline, clearing the gathering that for months served as a base of opposition to the multi-billion-dollar project. \nIn Missouri, a bill proposed a seven-year prison term for \"unlawful obstruction of traffic\", while the Minnesota bill would criminalise peaceful protesters for participating in demonstrations that subsequently turned violent. \nThe UN experts said there was no such thing as a violent protest, only violent protesters. \n\"One person's decision to resort to violence does not strip other protesters of their right to freedom of peaceful assembly,\" Kaye and Kiai said. \nSupporters of the US state legislative action say it sums up the frustration some people feel about protests that get in the way of daily lives, and reflects a wish to maintain public safety. \nFree speech advocates say the bills are worrying, seeing them as opening the way to criminalising peaceful protests.
