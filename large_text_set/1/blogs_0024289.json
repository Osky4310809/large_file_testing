Advertisement - story continues below \nThe complaint makes multiple references to Trump’s campaign. \n“The ‘grand opening’ of the Trump Hotel by this day, was also a nationally covered event, which was planned just prior to the U.S. presidential election,” the suit states. \n“Although Mr. Trump’s Hotel has now been opened and has operated for business since September 2016, and despite the fact that Mr. Trump was successfully elected as the next U.S. President, Trump refuses to pay the sums due for the account of work of subcontractors, like Freestate,” the complaint says. \nThe contractor alleges the Trump Organization will only settle for a fraction of the cost.

That’s what this is. Under budget, ahead of schedule. We built a hotel that is going to be one of the great hotels of the world. Just opened today. It officially opens today, and we built it for less money than was anticipated and we built it ahead of schedule by over a year. And if the country would do that, we would have a country that would be in much better shape than it’s — you know, highways, they build highways for double and triple the cost, they build hospitals,” he said then. \n“I want the American people to understand that this is under budget, ahead of schedule, and we need that for the United States,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T04:04:56.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
