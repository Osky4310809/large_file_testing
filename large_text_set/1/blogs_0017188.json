Activists made charges backed with video after a Central Park carriage company sued them in December in Manhattan Supreme Court. \nActivists Michael Dolling has been called a derogatory term for a gay man by horse carriage drivers “and one has stated with bluster that he would rape [HIS] mother,” the court papers say. \nA supporter of the drivers harassed activist Jill Carnegie, telling her \"Go home and make babies, \"You don't have a boyfriend? You're angry 'cause you don't have a boyfriend,\" and \"you're a witch,\" the legal documents say. \nAt one point, the driver ally tore flyers from her hand \"causing physical injury that necessitated police involvement after Ms. Carnegie did nothing more than talk to a family that was receptive to her message,\" the legal brief alleges. \nSupporters of the carriage drivers say they are the ones being attacked and harassed. Videos of one incident cited in the suit filed by his firm shows an angry bearded protestor get right in the face of a carriage driver. \n“The drivers are stationary,” said Hokan Udder, the owner of Central Park Sightseeing. “They are not moving anywhere. When the protestors cross the line most of the stuff is reaction to that.” \nVideos of one incident cited in the suit filed by his firm shows an angry bearded protestor get right in the face of a carriage driver, screaming repeatedly, \"What are you going to do about it? I am on the street. You can't do anything about it! What can you possibly do about it?\" \nAnother protestor was arrested and charged with assaulting a 55-year-old horse driver in October. \nThe protestors say that man, Edward Sullivan, isn’t affiliated with their groups, and that they are the ones being violated. Central Park Sightseeing LLC asked a judge to impose limits on the protestors who they say are costing them money in the form of lost business by screaming at tourists. \n“The evidence here shows this lawsuit is nothing but a pretext and they are just trying to prevent the protestors from legitimately exercising their first Amendment rights,” said lawyer Joel Kirtzberg. “If anything, the evidence shows that they are the ones assaulting and harassing protestors, not the other way around.” \nThe legal brief notes that the protests have caused tension. \n\"Although the protests have gotten heated at times-as most hot-button political discussions do-the overwhelming majority of the time, they have not been,\" the motion by the activists said. \nThe majority of encounters \"have been pleasant exchanges with people who are interested in hearing them out or brief, respectful exchanges with people who are not interested,\" the court filing says. \nIn an effort to make sure the protestors followed the law, a group leader organized two informal training sessions, according to the motion. \nActivists were taught to document violations of law by carriage drivers and peacefully dissuade people from taking rides, the legal brief says. They were also instructed to never touch any of the drivers or pedestrians, yell near the horses, block the carriages and threaten potential customers, the court papers say.
