It is characterised by blue pupils and irides which contain a white, floral pattern. Acquisition Edit \nThe Tenseigan was first manifested by Hamura Ōtsutsuki. Using its great power, he brought order and stability to the moon . Even after his death, the people of the moon treated Hamura's Tenseigan as a treasure and enshrined it as a religious object, devoting a plan to eternally preserve it. [2] \nIt is possible to manifest a new Tenseigan by combining the chakra of Hamura's descendants within the Ōtsutsuki and Hyūga clans. When an Ōtsutsuki implants the Hyūga clan's Byakugan , the combination of their chakra will transform the Byakugan into the Tenseigan. [2] Once implanted, the Byakugan will gradually synchronise with the Ōtsutsuki's chakra and mature into the Tenseigan, periodically causing its wielder painful pulsations in the process. Once the final, most painful pulsation has concluded, the Tenseigan will be complete. [3] Toneri's Tenseigan reverting to the Byakugan. \nA millennium after Hamura's time, one of his descendants, Toneri Ōtsutsuki , was able to awaken the Tenseigan by kidnapping Hanabi Hyūga and implanting her pure Byakugan, his own eyes having been sealed within the Energy Vessel at the time of his birth. Concluding that mankind had used chakra for evil purposes , Toneri was determined to fulfil his clan's thousand year vow by destroying humanity with the power of the Tenseigan. To this end, he intended to drop the moon onto the Earth, confident that his ocular power would be able to restore it. However, shortly after the completion of his Tenseigan, Toneri was defeated in battle by Naruto Uzumaki , causing his Tenseigan to fade and revert into the Byakugan. Hinata Hyūga subsequently took back her sister's eyes, leaving Toneri blind once more. [3] Abilities Edit Toneri in Tenseigan Chakra Mode \nThe Tenseigan allows the user to control attractive and repulsive forces, similar to the Rinnegan 's Deva Path . With the complete Tenseigan, the user is able to enter Tenseigan Chakra Mode , which grants the user enhanced physical capabilities as well as a number of Truth-Seeking Balls , comprised of all five nature transformations and Yin–Yang Release . By infusing the balls with Tenseigan chakra, it is possible to utilise additional powerful techniques . The Tenseigan is also capable of moving the moon towards the Earth, as well as powering a gigantic golem . [3] Its ocular power is capable of reviving a planet in the event it was destroyed.
