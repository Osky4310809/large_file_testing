It’s hard to believe that approximately one in every two people will develop some form of cancer within their lifetime. More frustrating still, there are only two approved treatments for cancer: radiation treatment and chemotherapy. advertisement - learn more What exactly are we constantly raising money for? Dr. Linus Pauling, a two time Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, told us long ago that “everyone should know that most cancer research is largely a fraud, and that the major cancer research organizations are derelict in their duties to the people who support them.” ( source )( source ) There are numerous examples of cancer fraud to draw from. One of them is the Brooklyn-based National Children’s Leukemia Foundation that was recently shut down, many years after they raised millions of dollars through professionally run fundraisers. They lured people in, claiming that the funds would be used to conduct cancer research and locate bone marrow donors while they ran their “Make a Dream Come True” campaign. Unfortunately, less than 1 percent of the millions of donated dollars actually went to helping leukaemia patients. ( source )( source ) This is disturbing information, but it’s not the first time that a major cancer charity has been called into question, not by a long shot. For example, a complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission describes four connected groups, all with cancer in their name, as “sham charities,” saying they instead “operated as personal fiefdoms characterized by rampant nepotism, flagrant conflicts of interest, and excessive insider compensation.” One of those groups was the Cancer Fund of America Inc. These groups stand accused of taking in almost 200 million dollars. ( source ) This is not to say that every single cancer charity is fraudulent, or that efforts to raise money for cancer research are useless. But after decades of research and relatively little success, I think it’s time to talk about cancer prevention strategies. 1. I Would Research Chemotherapy’s Success Rate In 2016, it’s estimated that there will be 1,685,210 new cancer diagnoses in the United States. It’s also estimated that approximately 600,000 of these people will die from the disease. And we can be reasonably sure that the majority of these people will be receiving cancer treatment. ( source ) advertisement - learn more Worldwide. the number of new cancer cases is expected to reach 22 million within the next two decades. If the cancer cannot be removed with surgery, doctors recommend chemotherapy. Even if the cancer can be removed, they will still recommend chemotherapy. According to a 2004 report by Morgan, Ward, and Barton, the contribution of cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adult malignancies survival in adults was estimated to be 2.3 percent in Australia and 2.1 percent in the United States. It concluded that, “it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival. To justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy, a rigorous evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently required.” ( source ) While chemotherapy has been shown to be quite effective for people who have early stage cancer, we have no studies comparing its effectiveness to ‘alternative treatments.’ We have no data comparing the relative success rates of chemotherapy and ‘alternative’ treatments, and this is to our detriment, as many people anecdotally report overwhelming success with these treatments. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a large majority of patients with metastatic lung and colorectal cancers — cancers which doctors did not expect them to survive — did not understand that chemotherapy was not a curative measure, but would merely prolong their life by a few weeks or months. ( source ) Despite their cancers being terminal, the focus on treatment led patients to believe they had a chance of survival. Yet, as a recent study conducted by researchers at Stanford University has revealed, approximately 90% of doctors would themselves choose to abstain from chemotherapy if they had terminal cancer, wishing instead for a better quality of remaining days. ( source ) Even if cancer is in a perceived ‘curable’ stage, is chemotherapy the right answer? Unfortunately, regardless of a physician’s beliefs on the matter, they have to tell you about chemotherapy and radiation treatment because they are the only two approved treatments. Recommending anything else could result in a lawsuit or loss of medical license. In 1985, a survey found that only about one-third of physicians and oncology nurses would have consented to chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer. Today, willingness to undergo cancer treatment by doctors who prescribe it is still lacking. While some would undergo treatment, many have still stated that they would not. Unfortunately there is little research on this available today. ( source ) While chemotherapy has saved lives, it has also ended many. Alternative treatments have likewise helped some and not helped others. There are two ends of the spectrum here; the problem is that one is ignored and even ridiculed. Below is a great video by Kimberly Carter Gamble that illustrates what many people are feeling today — that the modern day cancer industry has no interest in healing people but rather in keeping people sick so they can continue to profit from their illness. 2. I Would Research How I Contracted Cancer As I stated in the introduction to this article, we are so focused on curing cancer that we have neglected to discuss cancer prevention. We have also failed to consider what causes cancer in the first place. I understand the medical community is under a lot of restrictions in terms of what claims they can make, but to say there is no known cause for cancer is simply dangerous and misleading. Cancer rates have risen in tandem with our increasingly toxic lifestyles. Everything from the toxic household products we use and the hormone disrupting chemicals found in our cosmetic products to the chemicals sprayed on our food and land and the processed, hormone injected food — even the polluted air that we breath — has been linked to cancer. A simple 10 minute session of independent research will show you this. In my opinion, there is no mystery behind the cancer epidemic. Our lifestyles are making us sick, and only until we recognize this fact — and make the appropriate changes — can we hope to get better. Incorporating cancer prevention strategies into your life is an absolute necessity. These include following a primarily plant-based and organic diet, getting adequate physical activity, avoiding chemicals, and reducing stress. I were diagnosed with cancer, I would ask myself, have I been eating food sprayed with various chemicals? Have I been cleaning my home with bleach and other harmful household products? Have I been eating processed foods and meats? Have I been getting enough exercise? Am I constantly angry, upset, stressed, and irritated? Do I wear cosmetic products? What’s in my deodorant? There are so many questions to be asked, and it all starts with the environment we choose to surround ourselves with. 3. I Would See If People Are Having Success Using Alternative Treatments A growing trend among people who have been diagnosed with cancer is to seek out alternative treatment, and this is largely because so many people have reported such positive results. We can also attribute this shift to the vast amount of published scientific literature pointing people in this direction. For example, here is a quick video clip of Dr. Christina Sanchez, a molecular biologist who explains the power of THC. Other ingredients within cannabis have also been shown to annihilate cancer tumours. Decades of research have shown that certain ingredients within cannabis completely destroy cancer cells, and this is well established in medical literature, yet no human clinical trials have been conducted to prove its efficacy. It’s a shame, because when a pharmaceutical drug shows the same promise, clinical trials seem to be set up right away. Mykala Comstock is a wonderful example of cannabis’ effectiveness; she had T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a very rare and aggressive form of childhood leukaemia. In July of 2012, doctors discovered a basketball-sized mass of lymphoblasts in her chest. Her mass was so large that she was not able to be sedated for risk of death from the pressure on her esophagus and heart. Once she started using cannabis oil, her cancer disappeared. You can click on her name above to find out more information on that story. There are countless stories out there of people who have had success using alternative treatments. These include things like cannabis oil and even simply dietary changes. These stories are not difficult to find, yet we never hear about them. Unfortunately, most people receive their information from a television screen. Independent research and critical thinking, especially when in comes to diseases like cancer, are not being employed nearly enough by the general public. There are dozens upon dozens of promising studies showing various substances, including healthy food, to be potent cancer killers, but again, no human clinical trials are being conducted. Fortunately, this hasn’t stopped people from using and incorporating these substances into their diets. For example, a fairly recent study published in the journal BioMed Research International emphasizes how exploring natural plant products and essential oils for their anti-cancer properties is becoming very popular and argues that these substances should be studied further. Other studies, like this one, have shown that active ingredients in Indian cooking play an import role in the prevention and treatment of various cancers. Promising results have been seen with certain spices like fennel, garlic, clove, and cinnamon, but the industry doesn’t seem to care. And since the medical research doctors are given to read has been funded by pharmaceutical companies, most are simply unaware of these options. According to studies published in Life Sciences, Cancer Letters, and Anticancer Drugs , artemesinin, a derivative of the wormwood plant commonly used in Chinese medicine, can kill off cancer cells and do it at a rate of 12,000 cancer cells for every healthy cell. ( source ) The list literally goes on and on, and there are hundreds of substances out there with cancer killing properties that people are having success with. But doctors feel they cannot recommend these options because no human clinical trials for these interventions have been conducted. Why More Research Is Needed For ‘Natural Alternatives’ Rigorous research into these options is desperately needed. People have no idea what to take or how to take it. There are still many unknowns here, and the fact that more and more people are choosing to use options other than chemotherapy and radiation treatment means these types of studies need to be conducted. Unfortunately, pharmaceutical companies are not at all interested in supporting anything they can’t profit from; drugs are profitable, but real healthcare is not. Some good quotes below summarize what I am talking about. “The field of U.S. cancer care is organized around a medical monopoly that ensures a continuous flow of money to the pharmaceutical companies, medical technology firms, research institutes, and government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and quasi-public organizations such as the American Cancer Society (ACS).” – Ralph Moss, Ph.D., quoted by John Diamond, M.D., & Lee Cowden, M.D. in Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide to Cancer “The medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine, but also in terms of teaching and research. The academic institutions of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry. I think it’s disgraceful.” – Arnold Seymour Relman (1923-2014), Harvard Professor of Medicine and Former Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical Journal ( source )( source ) *This goes without saying, this is not meant to be taken as medical advice but encourages us to take power back when it comes to a topic that so many fear and yet don’t know much about.
