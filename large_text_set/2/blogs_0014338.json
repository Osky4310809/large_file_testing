But why was James pissed off then? UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 12 hours ago 12 \nMetallica's official Romanian fan club RoLoad posted a video the band's Grammys performance free of James Hetfield's mic issues. \nThe source noted that \"web feed was fine\" and that \"only the TV broadcast had problems for some reason.\" \nHowever, that raises the question of James' visible anger during and after the performance. Were the band's onstage monitors also messed up? \nPreviously, TMZ reported that an inside source revealed the technical issues were result of a stagehand accidentally unplugging the wire. \nAdditionally, a Recording Academy spokesperson issued a slightly different statement, saying: \"What we believe happened was that either a dancer or an extra clipped the line running on the floor and it unplugged at the base of the mic. It was, of course, accidental.\" \nPeople around the web also seem to point out that the band's official fan \"chapter\" would unlikely lie to fans and purposefully post fake footage. \nAnyhow, you can watch the reportedly issue-free performance below and draw your own conclusions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:42:23.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
