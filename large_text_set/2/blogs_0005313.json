(ANI) \nShiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray , on Monday, tore down on BJP ’s demonetisation drive and said that it wasn’t a natural disaster but a man-made one. Criticising the narrative of the BJP and the strict rules surrounding it, he said that if the people of this country were thieves then Prime Minister Narendra Modi was Prime Minister of thieves. Thackeray said that with the demonetisation drive, the BJP and the Prime Minister question the integrity of the farmers, life long savings of women and accused everyone of being thieves. The Shiv Sena- and BJP had been long allies before the Shiv Sena decided to call its quits on their partnership and contest the Mumbai civic polls on its own. Earlier Thackeray had shot down BJP’s claim that it was a friendly match between the Shiv Sena virtually scotching speculations that they may strike some pact with BJP in case the poll verdict throws up a hung House in the Mumbai civic body. \nEarlier on Friday, senior Congress leader and leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha had an outburst against the central governments and said that the BJP government, led byPM Modi had forced a pregnant woman to deliver her child while waiting in a queue. He further said that money was being seized throughout the country and asked if this money had reached these places through the banks. He said that it was all black money which was being circulated through backdoor transactions. He further expressed his outrage that for the first time in history, notes were being printed without the photograph of Mahatma Gandhi and added that there were also notes with printing on only one side. \nAlso watch: \nAzad’s statement came a day after the presentation of the Union budget 2017 by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley . The FM had heaved praises for the demonetisation drive and said that drive was the first big and significant step in the fight against black money and corruption. Azad took shots at the budget and its presentation and said that he had expected the government to be a little apologetic in wake of the aftermath of demonetisation and take less credit for the same.
