Instead, Conan O’Brien cameoed on a Mexican soap opera based on his own schedule and personal love of the genre.\nO’Brien has been out of California for a bit filming his upcoming primetime special , Conan Without Borders: Made in Mexico. His filming schedule put him close to Televisa headquarters — and from the sound of it, he jumped at the opportunity to add “telenovela star” to his long resume.\nWhile this video is in Spanish (of course) it shows off a few key Conan moments. Spoiler alert, but his character has a pretty stunning mustache. The name of the show is Mi adorable maldición , and according to Deadline , Conan’s character is named Joseph Robinson. Robinson’s main goal in the episode is to bring dairy products from Mexico into the United States.\nO’Brien admitted that he’s a big fan of Spanish television, so all of this was a dream come true. Hoy / www.youtube.com “I love telenovelas,” he said in an interview with a morning show called Hoy . “In the [United States] I watch the ones in Spanish. I love them. I wanted to be in one, and they let me turn into this mysterious man that sells cheese.” Invitado de lujo en #MiAdorableMaldición @Nachosada @Renotni @PabloLyle @MayaMishalskaOf @fabiolandere @erikdiaza @SantiHndz @ConanOBrien pic.twitter.com/1pNGJ6O1zO \n— Adorable Maldición (@MiAdorableOf) February 18, 2017 O’Brien worked with a producer named Ignacio Sada, who had nothing but kind words to say about the actor.\n“I think he did a great job,” Sada said. “Super fun. He impressed many people.” We seriously can’t wait to see more. And, we’re so glad that O’Brien left such a positive impression on the cast and crew.\nAccording to O’Brien’s Instagram, he’s having an absolute blast in Mexico, and seems to be basking in the glow of the culture, activities, and community.\nMuchas gracias #JorgeRamos for the great discussion and lunch. I wish you would have talked me out of the hot sauce. #ConanMexico \nA post shared by CONAN (@teamcoco) on Feb 20, 2017 at 2:04pm PST \n(And the food. We can’t forget about the food.)\nWhile we don’t think that the airdate of his Mi adorable maldición episode is set, Conan O’Brien’s full special on TBS will air on March 1st.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:41:52.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
