Before Sunday, Arsenal and Tottenham were Liverpool's only top-flight victims in the calendar year. While other teams beat the underdogs and need to improve against the elite, Liverpool defeat the best and encounter problems with the rest. \nIt looked like history might repeat when they trailed to a Burnley side that could yet post the worst away record of any team in Premier League history. Klopp's players were unconvincing, but ultimately garnished by goals from Georginio Wijnaldum and Emre Can, the much-criticised German providing a crisp winner. \nIt may have brought a modicum of revenge for August's loss at Turf Moor, where Burnley contrived to win despite having just 18 percent of possession. The Clarets had more of the ball in the rematch, but the visitors' game plan, which Klopp feels is the clearest in the league, remained similar. That clarity of thought was apparent early as Liverpool looked ragged and Burnley purposeful. \nThey snapped into challenges, got the ball forward quickly and defended in two blocks of four. Liverpool, with Philippe Coutinho particularly poor, scarcely resembled the all-conquering force of earlier this season. But they procured the points and perhaps the result, if not the display, will give them momentum. Emre Can's fourth Premier League goal of the season earned Liverpool victory. \n2. Origi returns to play a key role \nIf Anfield was relieved when Wijnaldum levelled, it is safe to assume Divock Origi shared those feelings. He had been arguably Liverpool's least effective player but helped fashion the equaliser and would go on to lay on Can's winner. \nThe fact Origi was on the left to cross, ahead of Liverpool's first goal, was a reminder of the willingness and running power that endears him to Klopp. The questions around him lie more in terms of quality than attitude. \nTake out a run of five goals in as many games in November and December and Origi has had a wretched campaign. He offered encouragement last year but has seemed to regress this season. His only previous Premier League start of 2017 came at Man United where his movement was excellent, but his passing was poor and he was substituted. \nIt is safe to say he took a while to adjust to starting again. He only touched the ball twice in the opening half hour and was taunted by the away fans who, remembering their former favourite and one of Liverpool's injured forwards, chorused \"you're not Danny Ings.\" Origi was dominated in the air by Burnley's centre-backs. \nYet he delivered the cross that Wijnaldum finished at the second attempt and, a quarter of an hour into the second half, rolled a pass into Can's path and German's crisp strike flew past Tom Heaton. \nWith Ings and Daniel Sturridge ruled out, Klopp had little option but to choose Origi when a muscle injury sidelined Roberto Firmino. Despite the Belgian's assists, Liverpool will hope the talismanic Brazilian is back to face Manchester City next Sunday, if only because of his terrific record in big games. \n3. Barnes pays back Dyche's bold move \nTeams who invariably lose on the road tend to be cautious. Not Burnley. Dyche selected two strikers and, if he is not quite as wedded to 4-4-2 as he was two seasons ago, it remains his favoured system. \nThat preference was justified within seven minutes when, as Matt Lowton angled in a cross, Andre Gray made a near-post run to distract defenders and his strike partner Ashley Barnes arrived at the far to finish with a flourish. \nIt was Burnley's first goal at Anfield since Peter Noble struck in 1975 and a tale linking Barnes and Noble seemed to have literary value to the visitors. A twist in the plot was that Barnes had sat out last week's game at Swansea, suspended for his sending-off at Hull, but Dyche was rewarded for restoring him to the team and demoting Sam Vokes. \nPlaying a forward duo had other benefits. Liverpool struggled against Burnley's directness and the Clarets defenders had two targets in attack. Gray was prominent from the off, looking to isolate himself against Ragnar Klavan. He had embarrassed the Estonian when surging clear from the halfway line to score his first Premier League goal in August and evaded his marker at times in the early exchanges here. \nHis teammate Michael Keane believes Gray is destined to play for England and, if he did not quite support such lofty claims, he was certainly lively in the opening exchanges before fading. Barnes excelled to the end but Burnley departed with nothing to show for their efforts. \nA side that play two strikers still only have two points, at Old Trafford and the KCOM Stadium, from a possible 42 on their travels. \nRichard Jolly covers the Premier League and Champions League for ESPN FC.
