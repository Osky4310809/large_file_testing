Sen. Elizabeth Warren seeks to pull pot shops out of banking limbo \nQuestion: Is Kyle Shanahan the right fit for Broncos coach? \nKiz : As Gary Kubiak said a tearful goodbye to the Broncos, John Elway was already saddled up and ready to go hunting for a new coach. Mr. Elway does not mess around. It’s always game on with him. So maybe finding a replacement for Kubiak won’t take long. Heck, if Elway opts for the best Shanahan available, the interview process could be finished in one phone call. It can’t be that easy. Can it? \nJhabvala : Elway knew who he wanted immediately after parting with John Fox in 2014. Kubiak was his guy and the only question was whether Kubiak wanted the job. This time around, there are obvious candidates but there is no clear leader. Not yet. Elway will be thorough but he knows what he’s looking for and he’s familiar with the candidates. The process will take longer primarily because of the NFL’s interviewing policies for assistants whose teams are in the playoffs. \nKiz : Kyle Shanahan knows his X’s and O’s, no doubt. At 37 years old, he has been around the NFL long enough to be comfortable in his own skin, unlike Josh McDaniel, who walked into Denver pretending to be Bill Belichick. So I think Shanahan is ready to succeed as a head coach. But does it really make sense to take a gig in his father’s backyard? Just as all Broncos quarterbacks work in Elway’s shadow, Kyle would be forever compared to Mike.

Would Kyle want to live in the shadow of Mike? It’s a personal question that only he could answer, but I would imagine that for coaches, players and executives at this level winning trumps all. The Broncos offer, undoubtedly, the best opening for a head coach this year with a great defense, two 1,000-yard receivers and high standards, as Shanahan knows all too well. \nKiz : Back in the day, there was bad blood between Elway and Mike Shanahan. I don’t think John would hold the sins of the father against the son, though. It’s cool to think a former Broncos ball boy could grow up to be the team’s coach. But even a grown man is always a little boy in his parents’ house. Shanahan 2.0 at Dove Valley sounds like a bad idea for a reality television show. I’d advise to Kyle to go coach the San Francisco 49ers. (His dad doesn’t have any history there, does he?) \nJhabvala : Many people thought Kubiak would make for a bad reality show, too. It was pegged as the best-friend hire, with Elway choosing a guy he could control. Remember that line of thinking? That was quickly disproved. The same could happen with Shanahan, if he’s brought on. But if we’re talking about a guy’s history, then Vance Joseph certainly can’t be ignored. Matt Russell’s former teammate at Colorado has become one of the league’s most respected defensive coordinators, and the Broncos wanted him in that role in 2015. He’s on their radar again and said he doesn’t want to a step back on that side of the ball. Shanahan has generated a lot of interest, deservedly so, but Joseph carries a lot of intrigue.
