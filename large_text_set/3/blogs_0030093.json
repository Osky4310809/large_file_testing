It’s been around so long that it paved the way for other popular mockumentary shows like The Office and Parks and Recreation , and the highly-anticipated 11th season is coming to Netflix this Friday. There’s already so much to love about the show, but you probably don’t know everything. Here are 15 surprising facts to tide you over for the next 3 days. \nThe show is meant to be episodic, meaning you should be able to watch any episode and know what’s going on. Of course, everything is funnier if you know the characters well, but it’s formulated to be easy to jump into in the middle of a season. 2 GIF \nRicky’s dad Ray is one of the more underrated characters in the show, and he’s played by Barrie Dunn. He’s also the producer who got the whole show off the ground in the first place. Ricky, Julian and Bubbles had made a couple of mockumentary-style films (such as Cart Boy ) which would later turn into Trailer Park Boys . Dunn saw promise from the very beginning and signed on as a producer. He was later incorporated as a character, but without his original help the show might never be what it is today. 3 \nSeveral plots were cut out of the storyline after the seven-year hiatus between seasons seven and eight. In fact, three babies were cut out entirely. Lucy and Randy had a baby, as well as T and J-Roc’s babies (whom they planned to be co-daddies for), but they were completely out of the picture when the show made its comeback. Luckily we got an explanation for Randy’s baby (the kid went to live with family so Ricky wouldn’t influence him later in life), but T and J-Roc’s child was never heard of again. 4 \nEllen Page got her acting start on the show. She played Jim LayHey’s daughter Treena, whom Ricky developed a fondness for despite previously thinking she had ulterior motives for being there. Page was only 15 when she made an appearance in the second season, and when the show took off later it paved the way for her future career. 5 GIF \nIn case you were curious, the word “fuck” is said 1,284 times in season 7 alone, and the word “shit” clocks in at 967. That comes out to about 46 “fucks’ and 31 “shits” per episode. 74% of those are said by Ricky.

Ricky, Julian, Bubbles, Trinity, J-Rock, Tyrone, Ray, Lucy, Cyrus and Sarah all belong to the first-name-only club. 7 \nJim Lahey’s daughter Sarah is actually related to him in real life. The actor, John Dunsworth, is father to Sarah Dunsworth. This isn’t surprising as the show keeps a pretty tight-knit cast, usually working with people they’ve already collaborated with in the past, or people they already know. 8 \nSpeaking of John Dunsworth, he’s a much more sophisticated actor than you might think. He got his acting start on stage. Since Dunsworth does such a good job playing the alcoholic, a lot of viewers have speculated that he’s actually drunk while in character. This isn’t true, however. He’s only drinking iced tea, and Dunsworth rarely drinks alcohol at all in general. 9 \nMike Smith opened Bubbles Mansion in 2006 and decked it out with Trailer Park Boys (and Bubbles) memorabilia, including shopping carts that held up the welcome sign. In its heyday it was serving $1 beers. A city ordinance ended up forcing the bar to change their alcohol police because they thought a few bucks for a few beers was too cheap. Smith then changed the price to $2.50, which sent the bar under in 2010. 10 \nWe all know that Ricky is poor. He has a limited wardrobe, and he’s stated that he only has a few shirts. In case you didn’t notice, the situation is “so bad” that he wears the exact same shirt for entire seasons at a time, as in every episode, until the season finale.
