Getty Images 0 25-Mar-2017 05:06:18 The Brazilian landed a lucrative salary package at Camp Nou and, still just 25, could surpass the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo \nNeymar might not have even touched the halfway point in his footballing career but is already among the best-paid and most marketable athletes on the planet. \nThe Barcelona star only turned 25 last month and has scored over 200 goals at club level and another 51 for his country, recently signing a lucrative new contract at the club he joined as the most in-demand player in world football back in 2013. \nNeymar is well on his way to becoming one of the wealthiest sportsmen of his era, but how do his earnings stack up when compared to the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo today? How much does Neymar earn? \nReports in Spain claimed Neymar landed a deal worth just over €300,000 (£260,000) a week when he renewed his Barcelona contract last year, extending his stay at Camp Nou until 2021. \nThat would put him below the figures earned by Messi, Gareth Bale and Ronaldo, with the Real Madrid duo currently the highest-paid players in Europe but Messi likely to overtake them both when he signs his next contract. \nRumour had it Neymar could have had significantly more than that had he pushed for a move to Paris Saint-Germain or Manchester United, but instead he chose to continue his career with Barca at a lower price. What sponsorship deals does Neymar have? \nLast summer, Forbes estimated Neymar's earnings from endorsements at $21 million (£16.8m) annually, making him the only active footballer earning more money off the pitch than on it. \nWhereas Ronaldo and Messi's endorsements account for 36% and 34% of their income respectively, Neymar's account for 61% of his pay. \nThat is largely because the 25-year-old is absolutely massive in Brazil, appearing on just about every product you can think of. Whereas Messi has not always been as popular as you might expect in Argentina and Ronaldo comes from Portugal, a much smaller country, Neymar is an idol to 200 million. \nSome of his many sponsorship deals include partnerships with Claro, Nike, Panasonic, Gillette and Red Bull. What businesses does Neymar have? \nNeymar has turned his hand to a few endeavours other than playing football, including appearing in the new 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' movie and releasing his own emojis for download. \nHe is also a partner in a company called NN Consultoria along with his mother Nadine Goncalves. That was initially set up to grow the profile and brand of Neymar himself but has since expanded to take on another clients such as Olympic gold medallist Thiago Braz and Santos' latest hot prospect Arthur Gomes. What charity work does Neymar do? \nNeymar has opened the Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr in a neighbourhood he spent part of his childhood in, Jardim Gloria, in the city of Praia Grande. \nIt is a facility that aims to help transform the lives of poorer children in the region through educational, artistic and sporting initiatives that aid their development and give them a chance to reach their full potential. The complex currently serves 2,470 such kids and their families. \n\"I could not come to Brazil and not visit [the institute],\" Neymar said last year during a trip home to attend his sister's birthday party in March. \"It is my family's dream and I am always happy every time I visit. It makes me want to keep growing this and doing this the right way.\" What is Neymar's net worth? \nMost estimates put Neymar's net worth at around £80m, which is substantially less than Messi and Ronaldo for now but impressive for his age. \nHis star power on the pitch and enduring popularity, particularly in Brazil, off it should ensure that the former Santos prodigy follows in the footsteps of Messi at Camp Nou and goes on to become one of the richest players of his generation. \nThe only thing that could threaten that status is his ongoing dispute with the tax authorities in Brazil, though the €56.7m (£49m) fine he was handed last year was recently halved by an appeals court.
