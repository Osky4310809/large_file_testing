Pomeranz discussed the shot with MassLive.com on Saturday at the Red Sox’s “Baseball Winter Weekend” at Foxwoods Resort and Casino in Mashantucket, Conn. \nThe Red Sox acquired Pomeranz before the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline from the San Diego Padres in exchange for top pitching prospect Anderson Espinoza. Pomeranz went 3-5 after the trade to Boston with a 4.59 ERA. The Padres were disciplined by Major League Baseball for giving the Red Sox incomplete medical records in the trade for Pomeranz, but Boston elected not to rescind the trade. \nThe left-hander is expected to compete for a spot in the starting rotation during spring training. \nThumbnail photo via Bob DeChiara/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T09:41:56.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
