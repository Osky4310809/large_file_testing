The latter claim stems from the alleged interaction that authorities referred to when releasing Tuesday’s photo.\nCummins is believed to be “armed and dangerous” and carrying two handguns, according to TBI spokesman Josh DeVine has said. He has no criminal history in Tennessee, according to authorities.\nThe Maury County Public School District, which employed Cummins at the Culleoka Unit School, released a statement last week announcing his termination.\n• Pick up PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: Cases That Shocked America, on sale now , for the latest on Casey Anthony, JonBenét Ramsey and more. \nThomas — who goes by Elizabeth — was reported missing by her family on March 13 after she told them she was spending the day with a female friend. According to investigators, at approximately 7:45 a.m., Thomas had her friend drop her off at the Shoney’s.\nShortly after 8 a.m., security footage shows Cummins at a gas station adjacent to the restaurant.\nInvestigators believe he picked Thomas up after he got gas. Neither of them has been seen since, and authorities allege Cummins is likely keeping Thomas “off the grid” and out of view.\nThomas had warned her family to call the police if she didn’t come home on March 13, the family’s attorney, Jason Whatley, told PEOPLE. He claimed that Cummins “groomed” her before they both vanished.\nBefore she disappeared, Thomas changed one of her social media profiles bios to say “wife” with a ring emoji.\nWhatley says his clients are both “shocked and saddened” by even a reference to the idea that Thomas wants to marry Cummins.\n“It is simply demonstrative of the power he has over her,” Whatley says. “If in fact they are together — and everything we believe is happening — then that change of status is perfectly consistent with a man who would groom a young impressionable girl into such a thing.”\n“There’s a numbness about it,” he adds.\nTBI: Hair Dye Purchase Not Connected to Alleged Abduction In addition to the new photo of Thomas and her alleged kidnapper, the TBI on Tuesday confirmed that Cummins’ buying hair dye at a local Wal-Mart days before the teen’s disappearance is unconnected to the case.\n“We have determined the purchase of hair dye by Tad Cummins was not part of his plan” for Thomas, DeVine tweeted .\nThe TBI released surveillance footage of Cummins shopping earlier this week, saying he was at a Wal-Mart in Columbia, Tennessee, days before the alleged kidnapping.\nIn the video, Cummins is seen shopping for women’s hair dye. Authorities had previously been unable to confirm what Cummins purchased at Wal-Mart.\nThomas’ family, via their attorney, told PEOPLE on Tuesday that they were nonetheless distraught by the footage.\n“It’s a combination of feelings,” Whatley said. “There’s the shock of knowing that there’s this man who has their loved one — but at the same time, appreciation the more information is revealed the more productive the investigation.”\n“ believe anything is possible in that regard,” Whatley said. “Did he dye his hair, did he shave his facial hair, did she dye her hair or cut it? All of these things are possible.”\nThat echoes the position of state investigators.\n“They might have changed their appearance or changed their vehicle,” TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said Monday. “We’re trying to cast the widest net possible.”\n• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?
