Cox/Getty Images Adam Wells   Alabama linebacker Tim Williams admitted to failing multiple drug tests in college on Saturday at the NFL Scouting Combine. Per Eric Edholm of Yahoo Sports' Shutdown Corner, Williams made his admission to failing \" a few\" tests with the media. Edholm also noted NFL teams have known about this for \"months.\" There were already red flags for Williams stemming from an arrest last September on a charge of carrying a gun without a permit, per Chase Goodbread of NFL.com. Per Stephanie Taylor of the Tuscaloosa News , the University of Alabama Police Department also found marijuana in Williams' car during the arrest but did not bring up any drug charges. Edholm said that speaking to NFL teams about Williams, \" they do not fear\" him being this year's version of Randy Gregory. The Dallas Cowboys drafted Gregory in the second round two years ago after he failed a drug test at the combine, but he only played two games in 2016 due to two separate suspensions totaling 14 games for violations of the league's substance abuse policy. B/R NFL draft analyst Matt Miller has Williams ranked as the No. 53 overall prospect in this year's class, but he didn't have the Alabama star going in the first two rounds in his most recent mock draft posted after the Super Bowl. Williams has been one of Alabama's most dominant defensive players over the past two seasons, recording 27.5 tackles for loss and 18.5 sacks during that span.
