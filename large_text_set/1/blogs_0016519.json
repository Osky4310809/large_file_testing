Talk about being out of touch with the rest of the world. Ariana Grande just hit the motherlode of cluelessness.\nThe woman who (allegedly, but I 100% believe it) has her handlers carry her around because she’s too lazy to walk and comes from a wealthy family actually claimed on Instagram that she is “the hardest working 23-year-old human being on earth.” \nActually, let me back up, it was really even worse than that. Here’s the exact quote, “When you’re cute but you’re also the hardest working 23 year old human being on earth #cute #butalso #CEO #unfuckwitable #haventsleptinyears.”\nSo she not only insulted thousands of other 23-year-olds (and those who know them) she also very humbly called HERSELF “cute.” Nice.\n\nSome responses…\n“You don’t know the struggle for a normal human being. #learnrealwork.”\n“Good luck with the real world gf.”\n“LOL humble too.”\n“You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth. You may work hard, but definitely not the hardest working person in the world.”\n“‘Hardest working 23 year old on earth.’ Ariana ugly, like there aren’t 23 year olds out her working 3 jobs to stay in their tiny apartments.” \nNo wonder no one is buying tickets to see her perform anymore.\nOf course she also posted this to Twitter and people went absolutely HAM on there as well…\nIf Ariana Grande is the hardest working 23-year-old on the planet, then I'm the Dali Lama.\n— Dani Mogg (@DaniellaMogg) January 17, 2017 \nYes Ariana Grande is the hardest working 23 year old on earth not the ones struggling making 60¢ a day trying to provide for their families pic.twitter.com/5B08kx2Lzn \n— miss tammy (@onefishtwobitch) January 14, 2017 \n\n\nDid I just see Ariana grande say she's the hardest working 23 year old on earth Lol\n— hannahdown (@HannahDown1) January 15, 2017 \n@ArianaGrande Hardest working 23 year old?!
