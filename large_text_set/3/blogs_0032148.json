He remains in custody at this time. \n\"The victim required hospital treatment for a shoulder injury.\" \nThe match was abandoned with eight minutes left to play following the incident and Goalsports were awarded the trophy. \n\"That was a very, very sad end to a cup final,\" Scarborough and District Saturday League chairman Alan Burnett told the Scarborough News . \n\"We condemn this behaviour as a league, there's no place for actions like this at any level of football, let alone grassroots leagues.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:18:04.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
