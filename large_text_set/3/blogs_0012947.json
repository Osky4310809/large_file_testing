Then you’ve got two people in one messed-up body, and then it’s a slippery slope to having several in there. No thank you! \nDon’t let that happen. Sharpen your first-aid skills with this series of scenarios. \nSCENARIO 1: A fellow protestor is being pepper-sprayed by a police officer. \nThe police officer continues to pepper-spray him for the entire rest of the protest, then sits in the passenger seat of the protester’s car to pepper-spray him as he drives home. He continues to pepper-spray the protestor as he heats up lasagna for his daughters, and spends the whole night pepper-spraying him while the protestor gets eight good hours of sleep. \nIn the morning, the protestor wakes to find the cop gone, leaving a note taped to a bottle of pepper spray reading “KEEP IT UP!” \nWhat do you do? Keep pepper-spraying the protestor, since withdrawal could kill him. Neutralize the pepper spray by holding the protestor's head in a bowl of milk for 16 straight hours. Euthanize everyone involved. \nCorrect! \nSCENARIO 2: A counter-protestor has used a terrible Santería ritual to turn your genitals to beetles. \nA Cold Yogurt zealot has tapped into forbidden Caribbean blood magic and placed a hex on you, and now your gentle parts are a swarming mass of gorgeous opalescent green beetles. Even worse, the beetles seem to be dispersing, scurrying off to find crumbs and dew drops, leaving you without even provisional genitals. \nWhat do you do? Squirt some epoxy down there to keep the beetles together, then paint them the color of your old genitals. Rub a slippery blend of okra juice and holy water onto your beetle-genitals to cleanse yourself of the hex. Euthanize everyone involved. \nCorrect! \nSCENARIO 3: A protestor is unconscious and unresponsive, probably because they’re having an extremely nice dream about Jane’s Addiction. \nA diabetic protestor has gone unconscious from hypoglycemia, and it seems like he might be having one of those perfect dreams where he’s floating on an inner tube down a lazy river with Perry Farrell and Dave Navarro, just laughing about how gorgeous life can be and swapping road stories. His pulse is weak, he isn’t responding to stimulus, and for all you know, he could just be getting to the part where Jane’s Addiction invites him on stage at Lollapalooza to fill in on bass, and then they let him keep the bass. \nWhat do you do? Softly sing \"Been Caught Stealing\" into his ear to coax him back into reality. Slam your head into the pavement to knock yourself out and join him in his utopian alt-rock dreamscape. Euthanize everyone involved. \nCorrect! \nSCENARIO 4: Living is dying. \nEvery step you take is a step toward the grave. Death begins at the instant the life-giving cord is severed; your umbilicus is the furrow where the seed of oblivion takes root. Your DNA is a self-destruct sequence, repeated over eons to the same futile end. Society is nothing more than a glorified death cult, and its worship shapes our every institution, our every relation, twisting joy, light, and life itself into a funnel to nothingness. Acts of defiance simply hasten the curtain’s fall; the clown rages and stumbles, but the crowd only laughs louder, and louder still. \nWhat do you do? Cling to the cold hope of my legacy, knowing full well I'll be forgotten before my heart even stops. Eat fruit and do CorePower. Euthanize everyone involved. \nCorrect! \nCongratulations, you’ve successfully completed our entire first-aid training simulator! You are now officially First-Aid Certified ! \nPlease print out this certificate and bring it with you to your next protest so they let you touch a corpse! Try something else. \nThis guy comes lumbering toward you all piss and vinegar, bunching his pants into fightin’ capris. \n“Eeaugh!” he howls. “Your tactics! Who cares if yogurt’s hot or solid or what? Quit it!” \nViolence freaks the common pedestrian out. Most people fear change; they just want peace and quiet to suck thoughtfully on Tide laundry pods and let onions rot in the bottom of their fridge. This guy, for example, has put on his Fearful Kangol and is spraying Coward’s Ichor. \nCan you convince him you’re doing the right thing, or at least to back off? Shut the fuck up, or I'll lay protestor eggs in your nutrient-rich belly! Let's start a dialogue, sir, like JFK and the rogue Soviet clone of JFK. Donk him with a brick. \n“Aaaeeiiigh!” he screams. “Someone help! This protestor’s gonna use me as a hive! They’re gonna pump me full of eggs, and in a few weeks they’ll hatch, and their squirming young will devour me for their first meal! I don’t recognize America anymore! I have no yogurt temperature preference!” \nHis screaming will get the cops’ attention soon. Let yourself be arrested. Donk him with a brick. \n“You trying to trick me? Like how JFK’s rogue Soviet clone lured JFK to a peace talk at a derelict oil rig, only to steal his helicopter, gouge himself a bellybutton, and make love to Mrs. Kennedy? You trying to steal my life and fuck my wife, you sneaky Hot Yogurt bastard?” \nUh-oh, you’re losing him. That's not what happened! JFK pinned his rogue Soviet clone under a fallen support beam and left him to die! Sir, please, won't you calm down and commune with me, mind to mind? Donk him with a brick. \n“Oh, so now you’re talking down to me? Do you think I’m stupid? Do you think I’m some idiot who carves dolls out of bar soap? Do you think my wife and I carve soap dolls and dress them up because we can’t figure out how to get our bodies to make children? Do you think we carve them secondary sexual characteristics to put them through puberty? Do you think we melt them when they disobey us, and sometimes just to be cruel?” \n“Well, so what! Fuck you!” \nHe’s not listening anymore. Donk him with a brick. \nYou deliver a blistering gourd donk à la brick to the galoot’s noodle. \nThe blow smashes the part of his brain that distinguishes between people and Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons. A placid expression stretches over his face as the violent protests that got him so riled now appear to him as a festive protest-themed balloon romp. He silently staggers away, gazing with childlike awe at his endless November wonderland. \nWell done! You successfully gave a bystander permanent brain damage, and now he could give a hoot about your protest tactics. Try something else. Start Over \nIf society is a symphony, violence is the goblin holding the conductor hostage with a gaudy plastic crossbow, screaming “VIOLINS…FOR ME!” \nToday, you are a throbbing vein in that goblin’s meaty leg. Try out some violence, for the good cause of making all yogurt hot. Punches and kicks. Tsunami. Do something else. \nIf society is a symphony, violence is the goblin holding the conductor hostage with a gaudy plastic crossbow, screaming “VIOLINS…FOR ME!” \nToday, you are a throbbing vein in that goblin’s meaty leg. Try out some violence, for the good cause of making all yogurt hot. Punches and kicks. Tsunami. Do something else. \nTsunami! Nature’s fury unbound! God’s wet judgment scrubs the wicked and blessed alike from the Earth’s weeping face! This is expert-level violence, S-rank only! Not even Noam Chomsky has a quote about a damn tsunami! \nSociety trembles as a colossal wall of water engulfs the horizon, seething with displaced crabs and shrimp. Then, it descends. Tsunami! \nWell, you did it. Your violent activism made society too drowned to even function. Mankind has been smeared across the pavement and dragged out to sea, yourself included. You’ve ripped the skeleton of humanity out of the body politic, leaving only the slick, loose meat of some leftover buildings. Voting is over. \nIn some ways, this protest was incredibly effective. In others, it’s more debatable. Try protesting again. Start Over Share Your Results \nLooting is a time-honored way of throwing society’s sick fetishization of property ownership over human life back in its face, while also getting more stuff. This is a win-win, or in protestor lingo, a “perfo bitzy-botsy.” \nAt the zoo, they have the good animals, and normally it’s a total fucking hassle to get your hands on those. When looting’s on, though, it’s everyone’s animals. \nSo quick, while there’s chaos, go get some livestock! \nYou loot, loot, and third loot. You loot like it’s going to be more illegal tomorrow than it already is. \nWhile most law enforcement’s dealing with the protest, you smash a terrarium and slide an African rock python down your pant leg, stun a Dorcas gazelle with a 64-ounce souvenir gulp trough and tie it to your belt, and toss a plastic bag over a western lowland gorilla so you have it now. \nAnd who’s going to stop you? The Mexican redknee tarantulas?! Leave with your haul. \n“Sorry, I can’t let you do that.” \nAh jeez, it’s zoo security. They must have been alerted by the screams of the animals you’re dragging behind you. Looting a zoo can be thrilling and lucrative, but it can also end with you getting tasered and added to the zoo’s permanent collection with a placard calling you a “BEAST WHICH FUCKS DRY PASTA” and insisting you reproduce with spores, like fungus. \nThis is a thing that can happen at a protest! Be warned! Try protesting again. Share Your Results \nHyyyuhgh!! \nThe man you just punched made billions carving custom jack-o’-lanterns showing Dustin Diamond getting hickies from different Snoopy characters, and selling them to war criminals’ wives to save their marriages. \nYour knuckles are his righteous reward for a life of sucking from the wolf teat that dollars come out of. \nYou just made jaw salsa. Tableside, baby! Kick. \nIt’s kick, great kick. Punch. \nHuuuuaaagh!! Gaaahh!! \nYou just punched a hole through the wall of the room where the corrupt governor keeps an entire deer population he declared extinct, just so he can slake his sick craving for Half-Of-A-Deer Tea. Kick. \nTwo kicks, very strong! Very strong kicks! Great two kicks. Punch. \nGYAAAAH!! GY HHH!! \nThanks to your fist, this ambassador will think twice before she squirts milky fluid out of an eyedropper labeled “PISS OF RACISM” into the Dalai Lama’s sleep apnea machine again. \nViolence works! \nYes, kick and kicking, 100 percent the kick. \nFinally, it’s kicking. More punching and kicking. \nNo, that’s enough. Don’t cause a scene. \nViolent protestors just pack a few essentials, but they can be absolute lifesavers. First, you’ve got fire. \nFire’s not just a wood disease that ruins raw chicken, it’s also an extremely versatile tool. Protestors use it to distract policemen with camp memories, destroy hot-dog carts owned by rapists, or to briefly become The Human Torch. It’s easily made at home and lasts as long as you feed it pictures of fire. \nSome protestors prefer electrical fire, but any kind works. \nNext, you have five gallons of olive oil. \nAs soon as the shit hits the fan, policemen will immediately start trying to hurl you toward their ravenous horses’ mouths. Dousing yourself slippery with five gallons of olive oil makes you un-grabbable, devastatingly fragrant, and technically Italian, a.k.a. the Policeman’s Nightmare. \nOlive oil may also stop bullets? This could well be true. \nNext, you have a cutlass cursed with a conquistador’s soul. \nThis is a no-brainer: an ancient rusty cutlass containing the screaming spirit of a 16th-century Portuguese murderer bound by a Nagasaki shinsokuis the perfect tool to jimmy open a stubborn tin of Altoids or Bubble Tape clamshell for that much-needed mid-protest pick-me-up. \nIn a pinch, it can also be used to cut a hot-air balloon loose for a quick getaway. \nNo violent protestor leaves home without a pound or two of human jerky. \nWhile an unthinkable snack for you or even him, a fistful of cured human meat will save your bacon when a carnivorous police horse comes clomping at you with the blood hunger up. Get caught short and get eaten by a state-sanctioned horse! \nHuman jerky is available off-shelf at most major supermarkets, and gives you their worst memories and some of their vocal tics. \nFinally, your outfit: a worn muslin nightgown. \nWhen it’s time to make a quick getaway, close your eyes, and bam! In your nightgown and stocking feet, you’ve faded into the crowd as a run-of-the-mill sleepwalker, out for some lawful somnambulism. \nNightgowns also offer a wide range of motion, and can be pulled up over your face to block out tear gas, or whatever kind of gas, who cares. Time for something else. \nA smart protestor packs light. Here are the essentials you brought today: \nFirst, you have a landline phone. \nNever count on cell service at protests. Like at a music festival, cell networks quickly get overloaded, making it impossible to get a call or text out. Instead, forego your smartphone for a good old-fashioned landline. Instruct your friends to do the same, and you’ll have no trouble coordinating your meet-up. Or just have them follow your cord! \nNext, you’ve got a copy of 1001 Gutbusting Goofs And Riddles, For Boys! \nProtests, marches, and sit-ins can be all-day affairs, and that means keeping your spirits up. Enter the good people at Belly Laugh Publications, whose 1001 Gutbusting Goofs And Riddles, For Boys! is a treasure trove of positive chuckles, overflowing with bonafide snickerdoodles like this instant classic: \nQ: How does an octopus clean his grandfather? A: He gives him a sea-sponge bath! \nDon’t be fooled by the title. These jokes (and riddles!) aren’t just for boys. They’re truly for anyone with a ticklish soul, ages 9 to 109. \nNext, you have Father’s Fitbit. \nFather is feeble, but he must reach his step goals. On his own, Father tops out at about 75 steps, and it puts him in such a foul temper. If Father’s step goals aren’t reached, he will refuse his white borscht and spit in the eyes of his caretakers, whose patience is positively saintly. Oh, but he must see his step goals reached! \nPlease, won’t you be the picture of filial devotion and take Father’s Fitbit with you as you march about? \nYou’ve also got tentacles instead of arms. \nTentacles are in most ways much better than arms. They’re flexible. They’ve got suction cups for grasping a protest sign or a bullhorn. They make you stand out, and they’re a conversation starter. Anyway, they’re not octopus tentacles, they’re just tentacles, okay? Instead of human’s arms, it’s tentacles for you. \nEven if you weren’t at a protest, wouldn’t you rather have tentacles than arms? Your arms are tentacles. \nFinally, you have your outfit: 30 feet of loose silk. \nThirty feet of loose silk is standard wear for the experienced protestor. Airy and versatile, 30 feet of loose silk allows for a full range of motion while creating a loose, indistinct silhouette impossible to identify after the fact. Bystanders won’t be able to describe you as anything but “blue” or “royal blue,” giving you free rein to protest as you please. \nIn a pinch, your 30 feet of loose silk can also be traded to a merchant for a slender mother-of-pearl-inlaid dagger, or baubles.
