The Irishman is currently taking time away from competing as he is due to have a baby boy with girlfriend Dee Devlin in May. \nWhen asked if there is a deadline for a fight with McGregor, the 40-year-old Mayweather told Sky Sports : \"We have to take it one day at a time. \n\"Can the fight with Conor McGregor happen? Absolutely - it is possible. We just don't know at this particular time. We will have to wait and see what the future holds. \n\"One thing that we do know about Conor McGregor - when he stands up he goes out there and kicks a**. When he is on the ground that is something totally different. \n\"I have been off since 2015 so I could be rusty, I just don't know. We don't know what the future holds or if he wants to fight. We will have to see.\" UFC president Dana White will have a part to play in any agreement for Conor McGregor to fight Floyd Mayweather \nUFC president Dana White was asked last week by TMZ about McGregor fighting Mayweather and stated: \"We're nowhere with it.\" \nWhite went on say he expected McGregor's next fight to be in the UFC and against the winner of the scheduled interim lightweight title fight between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson at UFC 209 last Saturday. \nHowever, that fight had to be called off when Nurmagomedov was hospitalised after experiencing difficulties making the 155lb weight limit.
