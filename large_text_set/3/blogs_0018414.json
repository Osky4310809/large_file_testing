Namely, I keep the volume low enough to hear what’s going on around me. Also, I take out my headphones when I check out. As someone who’s been on the other side of the register, it’s pretty annoying to check someone out when they’re on their phone, even if they are just listening to music. When you’re doing your own thing, though, I see no problem with sticking in some headphones while you shop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:36:11.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
