ABS-CBN/Released \nMANILA, Philippines — Piolo Pascual and Shaina Magdayao have nothing to fear from the latter’s big sister, Vina Morales, should they finally confirm their reported relationship. \nVina likes Piolo, whom she fondly calls “Papa P.” \n“He’s a very good person. He has a good heart. He and his family are very nice to Shaina. If he’ll become my brother-in-law, I’ll welcome it,” she said at the launch of her 30th anniversary album (Star Music), \"Vina XXX .\" \nBut big sis herself seems clueless about the real score between Piolo and Shaina. Vina’s kid sister hasn’t shared stories about her love life, even to her \"ate.\" Not that Vina does not want to find out. She tried, but failed. \n“My sister is very quiet,“ remarked Vina \nAll Vina knows is what most showbiz observers have seen, especially in that intimate dance video between Piolo and Shaina at the Star Magic Ball last October. One look at the viral video, and one will think that the Kapamilya stars have eyes only for each other.   \nAgain, Vina refuses to jump into conclusions and prefers broad statements instead. Yes, Piolo and Shaina show “a big respect for each other.” Yes, they get along and are always there for each other. But Vina insisted, “I don’t know what they have between them.” \nLike any sister, Vina supports Shaina in anything she does, including her choice of a boyfriend, for as long as she is happy. \nIn fact, this early, Vina is offering the track \"To Live For Each Other,\" composed by lawyer Loreto C. Ata, to Piolo and Shaina as a wedding song. \nAs it turns out, the song was originally cut out for a wedding. Its composer wrote it as a gift to her daughter, who shed tears upon hearing the love song her mom wanted to hear at her (the daughter’s) wedding. Vina herself will love hearing the song if and when she ties the knot with French boyfriend Marc Lambert. \n“In God’s time,” the singer-actress said when asked if she and Marc plan of getting into the altar. \nShe singled out the bouncy \"Eres Mio (You are Mine)\" as her song for Marc and her seven-year-old daughter, Ceana. The girl proves she inherited her mom’s talent as she duets with Vina in \"Pag-Ibig na Walang Hangganan.\" \nThe album and her full-blown romance are signs that Vina has moved on from the problems of 2016, which saw her filing kidnapping charges against former boyfriend Cedric Lee for allegedly using force to detain Ceana. \n“I believe we can get over all our problems if we don’t give up. One thing I learned in my 30 years in showbiz is I don’t have to address all the controversies and the bad things said against me. Silence is the best revenge,” said Morales. \nSilence, however, does not mean she will not fight back. Vina would rather “go through the proper way” – the court of law. \nShe has not lashed out on her detractors at the height of controversy with Cedric. She held her head high, convinced that she did not step on other people’s toes. \nHer quiet dignity shows an inner strength and a mother’s determination to fight for her only child. \nIt is this grit that tells Vina to love herself – to take care of her looks and health – despite the trials. \n“I won’t have projects had I allowed myself to grow fat. I love myself, so I took care of myself. That’s where I get my confidence,” she beamed. \nAs you watch her sing and sway to the beat of \"Eres Mio,\" you cannot help but agree. Here is a woman who knows what she wants, and gives her all to get it. No wonder she has lasted 30 years in a business that has not been as kind to lesser mortals.
