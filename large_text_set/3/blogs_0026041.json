The platform is much more than boosting posts and buying likes. \nThink about it – other than the NSA, who has more data on you than Facebook? They know what websites you visit, who you work for, where you grew up, your favorite football team – there’s an endless amount of data open to advertisers. \nSo if you’re still just boosting posts, you’re leaving some of the lowest hanging fruit in the orchard. To really turbo charge your Facebook advertising, try these three Facebook ad campaigns. They’re sure to boost your marketing efforts. After you watch the video, you can get a deeper look into each of our favorite types of Facebook advertising below. 1. Facebook Retargeting Ads \nRetargeting is one of the most underutilized ad practices - in fact, 46% of marketers believe that retargeting is the most underused online marketing technology . The good news is that Facebook makes things easy. All you have to do is set up a retargeting pixel on your website, get some web traffic to your site, and start advertising to your past visitors. \nWebsite visitors who are retargeted with display ads are 70% more likely to convert on your website. Let that number sink in. \nIf you’re saying to yourself right now, “Yeah, but Justin. There are tons of other places on the web I can run retargeting ads. Why Facebook?” \nHere’s why: Click through rates are 21X higher with Facebook News Feed retargeting than with standard retargeting. Cost Per Click is 79% lower with Facebook retargeting than with standard retargeting. Cost Per Acquisition is 63% lower with Facebook retargeting than with standard retargeting. \nIt’s a game changer - honestly, don’t go one more day without a retargeting pixel installed on your website. 2. Custom Audiences \nThere are lots of Custom Audiences you can set up within Facebook, but if you’re new to Facebook ads, there’s definitely one type you should start with. \nMost businesses have an email list, but not all know how it can be used on Facebook. If you’re sending out emails to your list (whether it be a newsletter or product offering), you’re probably seeing between a 15% and 30% open rate. That’s leaving a majority of people who’ve subscribed to your list in the dark – not good. \nIf you want to get in front of more of those people, you can use Custom Audiences to do that. Remember, these are people who've already shown an interest in your product or service by signing up for your email list, which makes them a highly desirable audience to get in front of. \nUpload your email list as a Custom Audience, and Facebook will automatically find users associated with those email addresses. It’s simple and highly profitable. 3. Dark Posts \nDon’t worry, it’s not as scary as it sounds. \nA ' dark post ' is a term used to describe Facebook posts that are paid but don’t show up directly on your Page. You get to choose (through targeting) who sees these posts, and when. \nNot only can you get hyper-targeted with these posts, but you can also use them to gain insight into what will work organically on your page - you can A/B test and let your results guide your organic social strategy with your findings. This tactic is extremely valuable as it enables you to improve and present your best content to your most important audience – people that have already connected with you on Facebook.
