The body-positive Instagrammer, who uses the name bodyposipanda, took side-by-side photo comparisons to a whole new level by showing the difference between posed photographs and reality , and also touched on how this can affect our mental health.\nIn her March 21st post, Crabbe shared a lingerie photo on the left where:\n“I was told where to put my legs, how to angle my arm, which way to tilt my hips and even how to hold my fingers. My eyes were watering from the false lashes and my hair will probably never look like that again.” On the right, she recreated the shot at home for a behind-the-scenes look at the reality behind lingerie photo shoots .\nWhile she looks completely stunning in both, the disparity is impactful since the media often only shows staged photos like the one on the left. REAL TALK: the photo on the left is staged as hell. I was told where to put my legs, how to angle my arm, which way to tilt my hips and even how to hold my fingers. My eyes were watering from the false lashes and my hair will probably never look like that again. THESE ARE THE TYPE OF IMAGES WE COMPARE OURSELVES TO EVERYDAY! A posed, polished, perfectly lit snapshot of the highlight reel. Except this photoshoot was different, because after all the typically 'flattering' lingerie posing, @curvykate asked me to go home and recreate the pictures make-up free, hair undone and relaxed. Because behind-the-scenes deserves to be celebrated too! Our bodies are glorious from every angle. Posed or unposed. Polished or not. And we sure as hell don't need to compare ourselves to anybody's highlight reel, after all, the model in the magazine doesn't even look like the model in the magazine most of the time.

And it is worth checking out in all of its glory.\nWe teamed up with @BodyPosiPanda_ to reveal the truth behind lingerie photoshoots.

Embracing my belly rolls, celebrating my softness. I know the world wants me to value myself higher in one of these pictures, to worship what's 'flattering' and be ashamed of what's not. Well I refuse to feel that shame. I'm worthy of self love either way, and I choose to see the beauty in both. Same body, same underwear, same person underneath - that's the only part that really matters. I'm wearing @dearscantilly by @curvykate for #thenewsexy campaign ✨ \nA post shared by Megan Jayne Crabbe (@bodyposipanda) on Jul 10, 2016 at 12:37pm PDT \nCrabbe voluntarily showed her followers the less glamorous version of herself with no professional lighting, her makeup removed, her hair not done, and her body in a natural position. Curvy Kate decided to do a whole series based on this. Because as Crabbe explained:\n“Every day we measure our bodies against the images we see, and when it comes to pictures of models (especially lingerie models!), all we ever see are posed, polished, professional shots. The angles are always the most flattering, the hair and makeup is always supernaturally perfect, the lighting and camera quality are nothing like real life. And yet we still compare our behind-the-scenes to their highlight reel. We forget how staged the images often are and how much effort, time, and manipulation goes into each frame.” Rocking my belly rolls ✔ seeing the beauty in my softness ✔ refusing to apologise for the space I take up ✔ feeling powerful as fuck ✔ · Lingerie by @curvykate - I did this shoot with them as part of a project that you'll see more of next week! Also - they chose all the shots, how refreshing that a lingerie brand would choose a photo with tummy squish being celebrated! ✨ Photo by @alisonvwebster \nA post shared by Megan Jayne Crabbe (@bodyposipanda) on Mar 15, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT \nWhile posed and professional photos have their place and time, we love that Crabbe is willing to show us what’s behind the curtain. Because comparing yourself to only staged photos is not healthy for your body image or self-esteem.\nOur #WCE is the awesome @bodyposipanda who is kicking ass in the #BoPo world!
