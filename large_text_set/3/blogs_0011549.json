He then fatally shot himself. \nThe other man in the home was killed. The woman was shot in the leg and the chest. She was taken to a local hospital in critical condition. \nTwo guns were found inside the home. Police believe the husband or ex-husband had both guns on him when he entered the house. \nThe 9-year-old son was in the basement at the time of the shooting.
