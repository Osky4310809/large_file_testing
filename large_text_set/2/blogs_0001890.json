(Photo: Cleveland Cavaliers Twitter) \nTwo high school basketball teams, Cleveland Central Catholic and Garfield Heights, played against each other at The Q in the afternoon on Wednesday before the Cavaliers vs. Timberwolves game. \nCentral Catholic won the game by just two points , and then the players got the best surprise: LEBRON JAMES! \n(Warning: There are some expletives used in this video, but you can't blame them. They were really excited.) tfw you finish playing your H.S. game @TheQArena & then someone walks on to get pregame shots up ... and it's @KingJames . ðŸ˜± #ThisIsWhyWePlay pic.twitter.com/Ca8GnzwdhO â€” Cleveland Cavaliers (@cavs) February 1, 2017 \nI would've freaked out too. Imagine being those kids, and the families and friends who went to watch them. They just won a game, and now LeBron is shooting on the same court. \nIt's also awesome that LeBron walked on the court while players were still there. Maybe it's the usual time he gets shots up before games, but he definitely was the highlight of the day for those boys.
