However, we got perhaps our best look at what to expect with this new clip from Disney , which gives us a glimpse of Belle’s introduction and a tour through her “poor, provincial town.”\nWe did get a small sample of Emma Watson’s signing voice in a previous trailer, but this scene gives us the clearest example of what her pipes can do. As soon as the back and forth of “bonjour!” starts to play, one can’t help but get a little nostalgic about the 1991 cartoon’s classic soundtrack. It’s hard to get a read on whether or not Belle will come off as an aloof weirdo or simply a woman trying to be herself in a stifling society, but this minute-long clip will probably encourage most fans that the film will fall into line with the original. Now, if we could just get a better look at Luke Evans’ Gaston (easily the highlight in the trailer ), we might be a little more content with letting the baker go with his tray like always.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:10:58.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
