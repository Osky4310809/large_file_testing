The car company will join Great Eastern Life as the new sponsors of the competition. \nThe Singapore-grown life insurance company extended their sponsorship with the S.League earlier this month in a deal expected to be worth close to S$1 million. \n\"It has come at no surprise to most [this sponsorship] because it is sort of synonymous that Hyundai gives back [to football] and try to help the sport,\" Teo said. Teo Hock Seng, centre in front row, helped bring Jermaine Pennant to Singapore's Tampines Rovers last year. \n\"I have loved the game for many years and this was a good fit. Our regional office asked at the beginning of the year if we can do more sports marketing and when the opportunity to work with this prestigious S.League came, we took the chance and came in. \n\"Even if the company didn't pay, I would have paid for it from my own pocket. Jokes aside, S.League is the backbone of Singapore football and we will do what we can to draw our connections from world football for the betterment of football.\" \nFAS interim president Lim Kia Tong was quick to heap praise on S.League's new sponsor, singling out the speed in which Teo and his staff managed to agree a deal with FAS assistant marketing director Rikram Jit Singh. \n\"Two weeks ago, we announced the good news that our long-time supporters Great Eastern had, demonstrated their faith in the S.League by extending their co-title sponsorship of the S.League,\" Lim said. \n\"Today, I am very happy to announce that Hyundai Motors will be coming on board as S.League co-title sponsors. As such, Singapore's only professional football league will now be known as the Great Eastern-Hyundai S.League. \n\"The fact that a leading and world renowned multinational company like Hyundai is willing to back the S.League strongly and wants to be part of Singapore football shows the strength of and the belief in the S.League and we are truly fortunate and extremely blessed to have their support. \n\"Teo Hock Seng, the man of Komoco and the godfather of Singapore football, is the pillar of and is instrumental in getting the unreserved support of Hyundai after Rikram activated his idea of approaching godfather Hock Seng for his support following Yeo's decision not to renew the sponsorship.\" \nRikram, who was a key member during the negotiations was pleased to see the new collaboration take flight, and urged more companies to support the S.League as it heads into a 22nd season. \n\"Hyundai Motors have long been part of the international football family since 1999 and their commitment to helping the sport develop saw them renew their sponsorship deal as FIFA's official automotive partner for the World Cup till 2022, while also putting the A-League on the world football map as their main league sponsor,\" said Mr Singh. ESPN FC's Jason Dasey and Fazrul Nawaz breakdown the next iteration of the S. League and who may challenge Albirex Niigata. \n\"It is important to note how significant this two-year deal to be co-title sponsor of the S.League is as we now have a two partners, together with Great Eastern Life, who believe in football and has steadfast dedication to see Singapore football climb to greater heights. \n\"The S.League is local football's best hope to nurture the next generation of footballers and we can only do so if more companies take the leap of faith and lend their support to this project. \n\"We must give special thanks to our friends from Hyundai motors, in particular, Mr Teo, who is the Group Managing Director of Komoco Group, for working tirelessly with his team in making this partnership come true. \n\"Together with Great Eastern Life and Komoco, this has given the S.League a great start as we prepare to go into our 22nd season and everyone can look forward to a fantastic season of football action ahead.\" \nSunday's Community Shield between quadruple winners Albirex Niigata (S) and Tampines will be held at the Singapore National Stadium. \nESPN FC editor Kelvin Leong is a former media officer for Singapore and ex-regional editor of ESPNSTAR.com.
