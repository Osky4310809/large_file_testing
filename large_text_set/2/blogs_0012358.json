The racing series, previously known as Saturday Night Fever (SNF), promises to deliver yet more close racing, with both amateur and professional drivers battling on the track in production-based racing cars. \nRound 1 of the 2017 season will begin next Sunday, February 26. The series has proved a hit in its inaugural year, with nearly 300 drivers participating over the course of the year, behind the wheel of as many as 149 race cars. The organiser expects these numbers to be maintained in 2017. \nThere will likely not be a shortage of talent on hand – the roster of racers who have competed at MSF last year includes top drifter (and Lotus Cars Malaysia head) Tengku Djan Ley, rally legend Karamjit Singh, GT racer Fariqe Hairuman, Formula Asia champion Keifli Othman and Malaysia Super Series champions Boy Wong and Faidzil Alang. \nFemale racers such as Boey Chai, Geraldine Read, Nursharina Binti Nor Ramlle and Faye Kusairi have also taken to the track, while this year will see the entry of teenage brothers Afiq Haikal and Amirul Haikal, age 15 and 16 respectively – experienced go-karters who will make their debuts in sedan racing. \nA highlight of the series is the Saga Cup category, a revival of the Proton Saga Championship of the 1990s, which became a stepping stone for many of Malaysia’s racing legends. The new championship is split into two categories, Expert and Novice – with the former being the stamping ground of the country’s top racers as well as its racing legends from the ’80s and ’90s, who will fight tooth and nail for the win. \nAnother top attraction is the Race Car Open category – this top-flight racing series features cars that have been professionally prepared and tuned for maximum performance, pairing professional racers with top racing tuners across Malaysia. \nOther forms of racing that will be present at MSF include Special Kei, Super 1,500 NA, Proton 1,800 NA, Street Tuned and Street Tuned 1,600, Super Street and 1,600 and 1,800 Race Car races. Paddock tickets for the race are priced at RM20 before 11 am on February 26, and RM35 after.
