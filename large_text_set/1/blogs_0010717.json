Ash Carter says more has to be done to help veterans. \nOn Sunday, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the incident was another brutal reminder that more needs to be done to help veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental issues. \n‘We keep learning more about how to deal with this kind of illness, we’re gonna learn more and we have to do more,’ he said on NBC’s Meet the Press. \n‘The so-called invisible wounds of war — are something we do take seriously and we have to take seriously.’ \nUnbelievable. \nThe investigation is ongoing and it is not yet clear that it was due to mental illness, and not terrorism.
