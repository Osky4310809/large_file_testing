In a game of “Would You Rather” on her app , the Revenge Body and Keeping Up with the Kardashians star answers what seems like a no-brainer for us meat-mongers: Would you rather eat pork or gain ten pounds? Her choice? “I would for sure rather gain ten pounds! I don’t think I’ll ever eat pork in my life.” So…no bacon ? “Turkey bacon only, baby!,” she says. Accordingly, the reality star and meticulous kitchen organizer previously wrote she would have to make tweaks on Thanksgiving stuffing recipes since “all of the recipes have bacon in them.” For more celebrity diet news, follow People Food on Facebook . Beyond sizzling a breakfast pork alternative or devising new twists on classics, Kardashian says she also creates dishes like potato soufflé with her stand mixer.

It is what it is!” Kardashian says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:22:47.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
