He became a soldier in the 7th Cavalry in the United States Army, and was a participant in the Wounded Knee Massacre. After the Battle of Wounded Knee, DeWitt felt regret in his actions and sought redemption through baptism. DeWitt was baptized by Preacher Witting , found a new cause in Christianity, and changed his name to Zachary Hale Comstock. \nLittle was known of Comstock prior to the baptism, and he rarely spoke of anything that happened before that event. On occasion he mentioned that he was a member of the 7th Cavalry and a participant in the Wounded Knee Massacre. After the baptism, Comstock became a deeply religious man, used his newfound faith to reshape his identity and became an influential man within the United States government. Creation of Columbia Zachary Comstock giving a speech, featured in Columbia: A Modern Day Icarus? \nSometime after his baptism, Comstock met Rosalind Lutece , a genius physicist who was experimenting with manipulating the actions of atoms â€” through use of her 'Lutece Field', being able to lock atoms at fixed positions in space. Comstock took great interest in her research, which would allow the creation of the floating city he claimed to have seen in a vision. [3] Receiving support from the United States government, Comstock oversaw the construction of that city, which he named Columbia. It was launched in 1893 [4] with much fanfare. Comstock became its leader, later creating a political party of its white inhabitants called The Founders . \nComstock began to see the idea of America as \"the New Eden,\" and the Founding Fathers as prophets of God's Great Plan. He also saw Caucasians as the only truly free race, and viewed \"minority\" races with total contempt. He declared Abraham Lincoln \"the Great Apostate\" who brought nothing but war and death upon the country. He also saw Columbia as the key to usher the world into righteousness, and became determined to make it a reality. \nShortly afterwards, Comstock would marry one of his devotees, Lady Annabelle Comstock . Discovery of Inter-dimensional Tears Edit \nBetween 1892 and 1893, while conducting further study into the Lutece Field, Rosalind found that she was able to induce communication into an alternate universe. She made contact with Robert Lutece , an alternate version of herself, who was performing the same exact experiment. Determined to find a way to see Robert face-to-face, Rosalind reported her findings to Comstock. Comstock provided Rosalind with additional funding to further her research, believing her discovery was a window into the future, despite her insistence otherwise. In 1893, Rosalind and Robert were able to create a machine to open Tears into alternate universes; on October 8 of that year, [5] [6] they successfully opened their first Tear, allowing Robert to cross into Rosalind's universe. \nComstock used this device extensively, utilizing Tears to look into other realities, and even see future happenings. When he showed these visions to inventor and businessman Jeremiah Fink , the latter was able to greatly advance technology in Columbia through various inventions such as the Sky-Hook and mass-produced Vigors . (He would also eventually create the Songbird for Comstock, based on a ' wonder ' he saw through the Tears. [7] ) Due to Comstock's use of the tears, the people of Columbia saw him as a true prophet, and began to worship him. The Presentation and Secession of Columbia Edit A statue of Zachary Comstock in Columbia's Welcome Center. \nPresented as a floating symbol of American ideals at a time when the United States was becoming a world power, Columbia was sent to all corners of the globe on a goodwill tour. In 1901, during the Boxer Rebellion in Peking , China, Comstock learned that the Boxers were holding American citizens hostage and ordered Columbia to open fire upon the Chinese populace. This act revealed to the world that Columbia was, in fact, a giant warship. The United States government disavowed Columbia, and ordered Comstock to stand down. Seeing this as a betrayal, Comstock led Columbia in seceding from the Union the following year, and the city vanished into the skies. Comstock thereafter declared Columbia the true America, believing the United States to be a shell of its former self, and condemning it along with the rest of the world. The Lamb of Columbia Edit \nThrough Rosalind and Robert's device , Comstock saw that Columbia would only prosper as long as his bloodline continued to rule the city. However, overuse of the Tear device took its toll on Comstock; and he aged rapidly, and soon discovered that he had been rendered sterile. [8] Desperate to have a blood successor, he conferred with the Luteces, and the three deduced that an heir could be procured from another universe. \nIn October 1893, Robert was able to find Booker DeWitt. After rejecting Preacher Witting's baptism, Booker, still-regretful, had spiraled deep into alcoholism and gambling debt. Comstock had Robert offer to wipe away those debts in exchange for Booker's infant daughter, Anna DeWitt. Booker haltingly agreed, and Robert brought Anna to Comstock. Zachary Comstock with an infant Anna DeWitt, whom he renamed Elizabeth. \nAlmost immediately regretting his decision, Booker pursued Robert to retrieve Anna. He found them in an alleyway preparing to pass through a Tear back to Comstock's reality. Although Booker tried to stop him from taking Anna through the Tear, Comstock managed to escape with her. The Tear severed Anna's pinky finger, the resulting scar she hid with a thimble. \nComstock saw Anna as the key to his dream of remaking the world a reality. However, the child was rejected by Lady Comstock, who believed her to be Rosalind and Comstock's \"bastard\" child. At Lady Comstock's insistence the child not live under their roof, Comstock created Monument Island Tower to house her. When the child began to develop Tear-making powers, Comstock saw to the creation of the Siphons to keep them in check. Renaming her Elizabeth , Comstock began to call her the \"Lamb of Columbia,\" and the Founders soon worshiped her as their savior. \nOveruse of the Luteces' tear machine continued to deteriorate Comstock's body, giving him cancer, and causing him to have the appearance of an old man at thirty-eight years of age. The Tears gave him the knowledge that Booker would eventually find a way to take Elizabeth from him. He began to forewarn the populace that a \"False Shepherd\" would appear, and began formulating a plan to make Elizabeth servile to him. Murder of Lady Comstock and the Luteces Edit \nLady Comstock had been growing frustrated and angry with keeping the truth about Elizabeth from the populace. Comstock, knowing that she was going to reveal the truth, in 1895, [9] had Lady Comstock killed and framed her servant, Daisy Fitzroy , for the murder. This act set in motion the chain of events that would lead to Fitzroy creating the revolutionary group known as the Vox Populi . \nMeanwhile, Rosalind and Robert saw the future of Columbia, and what Elizabeth would become, through their machine. In an effort to prevent such a future, they plotted to take Elizabeth from Comstock and return her to her original universe. Comstock soon discovered what they were doing, and ordered Jeremiah Fink to sabotage their contraption, which seemingly killed the two as they were using it. The effects of the sabotage in fact caused the Luteces to exist across all space and time, giving them the ability to appear wherever and whenever they wanted. Still determined to stop Comstock, they devised a plan to send Booker to Columbia to retrieve his long-lost daughter. BioShock Infinite Main article: BioShock Infinite The Prophet and Booker meet face-to-face. \nComstock becomes aware of Booker's presence after a commotion at Columbia's annual Raffle & Fair and sends his forces after the man, determined to stop him from retrieving Elizabeth. At one point he confronts Booker directly, mocking the man's personal failures and tries to trap him inside a burning airship. Comstock's efforts are for naught, as Booker reaches Monument Island and Elizabeth willingly leaves with him. Comstock's tactics soon become more aggressive; he uses Siphons to hijack Elizabeth's powers and resurrect Lady Comstock as the Siren to stop them from proceeding. \nWhen Comstock is finally able to recover Elizabeth with the help of Songbird, he takes drastic measures to keep her servile: barricading her in Comstock House , instructing his scientists to operate to decrease her access to her powers, and has her fitted with an electric mechanism that delivers an intensely painful shock when she is disobedient. [10] The scientists then use this device for mental conditioning, to turn her to Comstock's way of thinking and to squash her hope that Booker will come for her. \nIn the reality where this occurs, Comstock successfully turns Elizabeth into a brutal and murderous dictator. Feeling regret for allowing herself to become Comstock's heir, Elizabeth brings Booker to her universe. She gives him instructions to give to her other self on how to avoid this fate. She then sends him back to the other timeline, where Booker is able to rescue Elizabeth, and the two resolve to murder Comstock.
