Rick Scott speaks at a press conference about the Zika virus in Doral, Florida, U.S. on August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Joe Skipper/File Photo 5410330 \nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott told reporters Friday he reached out to President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence but not President Obama about federal resources following the deadly shooting at Fort Lauderdale Airport. \n“I have reached out to President-elect Trump, and spoken to him and to Vice President-elect (Mike) Pence multiple times to keep them informed, and they told me whatever resources that we need from the federal government, they would do everything in their power to make that happen,” Scott said. \nThe circumstances mirror recent events where leaders around the country and world are looking to Trump over Obama for responses to present and future situations. \nAccording to a list of calls made by Scott Friday afternoon and released by the governor’s office, he spoke to Trump and Pence at 2:00 p.m. followed by a series of calls to state officials, airport officials, hospital authorities, and county law enforcement offices. \nReporters asked Scott whether he had talked to Obama and Scott said he had not talked to the sitting president and Obama had not reached out to him. Scott added he had not reached out to Obama either, but he had contacted Trump and Pence numerous times. \nA reporter later asked Gov. Scott, “Wouldn’t it be appropriate to call the president for resources?” \n“I have a personal relationship with Vice President Pence and President-elect Trump, and I reached out,” Scott responded. Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nTrump also said in a tweet that he had spoken with the Florida governor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:26:07.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
