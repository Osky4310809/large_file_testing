It was like he was in a prison. \n“The beds were all dirty and the hospital looked run down. It was just filthy. I’ve never been so scared.” \nThe couple headed for the Caribbean Islands on November 4 last year, having saved for more than 18 months to go on holiday. \nBut as their trip was drawing to a close, David started to feel light headed and collapsed.

Three days later they said they were going to try and take him off the ventilation. \n“They said that if he didn’t start breathing on his own then they were going to have to let him go.” The dad-of-two was tied down with bandages to stop him falling out of bed (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) Read More Mum reveals Thomas Cook 'holiday from hell' where romping guests left 'SPERM floating in hotel pool' \nAfter a couple of days, David showed signs of recovery and was transferred to another ward at the hospital. \nLiz said: “The nurses tied him to the bed for three days with bandages because they said he was at risk of falling out. \n“He then started getting cuts on his hand and the nurse said he was allergic to the plasters but that never happens in England. \n“He was covered in bed sores and I was seeing him get worse. The level of care at the hospital was disgusting.” \nAfter spending 10 days in hospital, David was released on November 30 and flew back to the UK four days later. \nHowever, he is currently receiving treatment and physiotherapy at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary up to three times a week to treat his injuries.

We just don’t know where to turn.” \nBoth the hospital and the insurance company were contacted for a comment.
