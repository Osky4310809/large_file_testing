The Hindus are not responsible for that. Responsible are those who talk of four wives ad forty children,” the MP said. “We say four wives and forty children won’t do, won’t do, won’t do...it is not the time for four wives ad forty children. Women are not machines. Women should be respected, be they Hindu or Muslim,” he said. \nADM administration, Meerut, Dinesh Chandra told The Hindu : “Yes, it (EC) has sought a report from the ADM City and SP city (Meerut). We will soon inform you of the action we are taking.” \nSakshi Maharaj later sought to clarify his remarks claiming he did not target any community. “I have been misquoted and am ready to face Election Commission,\" he told a news channel. He could not be reached for further comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T13:09:39.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
