Huber confirmed to TheBlaze that “(v)eteran teachers are furious about this,” while adding that parents were also “rightfully” angry about what had transpired, though he insisted that reports of the students’ names being included in the game were “flat wrong,” an insistence many parents found impossible to accept. \nOne member of the faculty who was named in the game as a “kill” option contacted the police and reported that they “felt threatened.” Local police have watched the video but found nothing warranting criminal charges, instead deferring to the school to determine how to handle it. \nThis is outrageous, and hopefully the rest of the teachers and staff involved in this terrible “game” will be held to account for their actions. \nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter so everyone can hear about the Michigan teachers who were caught on camera playing a disgusting “game” that possibly involved some of their students. What do you think should happen to these teachers caught discussing which fellow faculty and students they'd like to marry, have sex with or kill? Scroll down to comment below!
