Plus, he no doubt would've added but didn't, it's not like we have a ready-made replacement for the Brazilian. He needs to play. \nOther players may have more viable understudies, with the most frequently rotated positions of right inside forward (Pedro & Willian, who have been trading off for the last six games as starters), and non-Kante midfielder (Matic & Fabregas) generally the two biggest decisions that Conte has to make before a game. It sounds like however that we should not be expecting any changes from the Arsenal win. \n\"For sure there is this possibility [for Cesc and Willian to start] because we are talking about two great players who are in great form. To have Cesc and Willian on the bench or on the pitch is very important. Pedro is also playing very well, he's in great form. When Cesc plays he's doing very well.\" \n\"I have different solutions. The most important thing is that every single player is in good form and they have a good attitude whether they are in the starting 11 or on the bench.\" -Antonio Conte; source: Chelsea FC \nAnd that possibility will be the FA Cup, coming up next weekend. For this game on Sunday, it's as you were for the second straight game, especially considering that Burnley have the third-best home record in the league after Chelsea and Spurs. \n3-4-3: Courtois | Cahill, David Luiz, Azpilicueta | Alonso, Matic, Kante, Moses | Hazard, Costa, Pedro \nThe community votes are almost in full agreement , but prefer Fabregas over Matic 61%-50%.
