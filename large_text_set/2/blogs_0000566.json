ADVERTISEMENT \n“I was excited to hear about that because it shows how professional he is,” said the former assistant coach of Gilas Pilipinas. “Hopefully we can put him through some individual workouts before we even start team practices.” \nThough reedy at 261 pounds, Thabeet will be an imposing presence for Mighty Sports at the middle, being a solid blocker. \n“He will provide us a huge defensive presence down low and hopefully some inside scoring, too,” added Charles, younger brother of Rain or Shine guard Chris Tiu. \nTiu will be assisted by University of the Philippines mentor Bo Perasol. \nFormer Ginebra import Justin Brownlee and Dominic McGuire are arriving on Monday in time for the team’s official practice. \nFormer collegiate superstars Jeron Teng and Kiefer Ravena and two-time PBA MVP Willie Miller will likewise join the team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:48:43.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
