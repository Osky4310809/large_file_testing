Bellew reveals how his acting career started \n\"Believe you me I thought it was a wind up,\" Bellew said. \n\"I remember the day perfectly, Everton had just been bounced 6-3 at home to Chelsea. \n\"The phone call came in and he said, 'Listen Tony, my name's such and such, I'm calling on behalf of Sylvester Stallone and Warner Brothers and they want to see you to be in the next Rocky movie'. (Photo: Warner Bros) \n\"And I just went, 'I don't know what's going on here, pal. But I think you must have the wrong number'. I thought it was a p*** take. \n\"He phoned back again and he said, 'I don't think you believe me, do you?'. \n\"So I said, 'Listen mate, I'm not really in the mood. I've just watched my team get tanked 6-3, leave it out'. Bellew is a life long Everton fan (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \n\"He phoned me back a third time and I asked where he got my number from. He said Ross Barkley. The phone went down immediately. \n\"I phoned Barkley and said, 'If you and the lads are having me on I swear to god your car will be on bricks in the morning'.\" \nThe Nightly Show continues tonight at 10pm on ITV.
