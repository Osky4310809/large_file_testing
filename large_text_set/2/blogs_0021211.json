LOUIS • Former St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce has endorsed 21st Ward Alderman Antonio French to be the city's next mayor. \n“I've long admired Antonio French,” Joyce said in a statement. “He's a smart, talented guy who walks the walk. He understands the needs of our entire city.” \nUnderstanding the entire city has been a central campaign theme for French, who has been running a cable television ad where he's walking along Delmar Boulevard talking about the divide between north St. Louis and south St. Louis. \nIn interviews, French has promised to start the process of revitalizing sections of north St. Louis that have been long neglected. \nIn her endorsement, Joyce also talks up French's commitment to reducing violence, saying he “has the plan and energy to get it done.” \n“I'm proud to endorse him to be our next mayor,” she said. \nJoyce previously expressed support for both French and city Treasurer Tishaura Jones, saying either of them would be a \"breath of fresh air in City Hall.\" Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nBe informed.
