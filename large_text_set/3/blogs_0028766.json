In fact, they’d felt it themselves. \n“When he first came into the club, we knew straightaway,” Port Adelaide captain Travis Boak told foxfooty.com.au . \n“He put Hamish Hartlett on his arse in his first training session and Hamish is not a light boy. \n“He was certainly feeling it, so we knew we had a pretty quality player and someone who wanted to compete. Since then, he’s put Ollie Wines on his arse as well.” \nFollowing a blistering three pre-season games, Port Adelaide confirmed on Monday that Powell-Pepper would make his debut in a Round 1 clash with Sydney at the SCG this weekend. \nIt caps a stunning rise for the big-bodied teenager, who was recruited to the Power from East Perth with Pick 18 in last year’s national draft. \nLIVE stream every game of every round of the 2017 Toyota AFL Premiership Season on FOX SPORTS.

He’s one who has done that and Joe Atley is another. \n“There will probably be a couple more that you’ll see over this year and next year that will do the same thing. But what we love most about those kids is that they want to learn and they want to compete. They’re the type of guys you want at your club and on your team.” \nIndeed, it’s the likes of Powell-Pepper and Atley who Port Adelaide hopes will add a new dimension to the side this season following a two-year period of stagnation. Sam Powell-Pepper celebrates a goal against the Hawks. Picture: Sarah Reed.   \nThe Power have been unable to build upon a narrow preliminary final loss to Hawthorn in 2014, leaving coach Ken Hinkley in search of new blood to freshen up the playing group. \nAnd he looks to have found it, with Dan Houston and mature-aged recruit Brett Eddy also upgraded from the rookie list ahead of the opening game of the season. \n“Those two have certainly put their hand up,” Boak said. \n“They’ve had fantastic pre-seasons and in the games leading up to Round 1, they’ve been great. \n“Brett has got rewards for what he’s done, not only last week but before that. He just kept presenting and kept presenting and that’s what you want from a forward. \n“He’s a really smart forward who has learnt a lot. He’s played in a few different competitions, so he’s super smart in the air and on the ground. He got his rewards on the weekend. He’ll continue to work and hopefully provide a big target for us down forward. \n“Dan is another one who has come off the rookie list and done it the harder way. He just wants to get better and improve and they’re the guys who make it. \n“They want to learn and get better and hopefully they get their chance in Round 1.” \nAnd, as for Powell-Pepper, Boak has learnt from his teammates’ hardships at training: “I’m trying to steer clear of him.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:51:42.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
