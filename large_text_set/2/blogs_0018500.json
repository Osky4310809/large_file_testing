The praised shonen title will return to the spotlight later this year when its first live-action film hits theaters in Japan. Helmed by Warner Bros. Japan, the flick will bring characters like Edward and Alphonse Elric to life. As the film’s premiere grows closer, fans are turning back to Fullmetal Alchemist ’s anime titles to celebrate all things alchemy. And, now, the company Good Smile is capitalizing on the franchise’s revival with some really adorable figurines. \nAt this year’s Winter Fest, a slew of toy companies have been busy releasing their line-ups for 2017. Good Smile has done no differently, but their upcoming collection of Nendoroid figures include a pair of very familiar State Alchemists. The company has announced they will be released miniature figures of both Edward and Alphonse. \nAnd, seriously - they are almost too cute for words. \nThe Edward figure looks even shorter than his anime counterpart, but it doesn’t do away with any of the hero’s sass. The doll shows Edward performing a transmutation sans circle, and his mouth is cocked into a sly grin. As for Alphonse, the character’s suit of armor looks cute and chibi on its new figure. Edward’s younger brother can be seen striking a martial arts pose, and his tall frame has clearly been shrunken down. \nYou can check out the two images in the follow slides! \nIf you are not familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist , then you have plenty of time to watch the anime before its live-action film arrives. The series follows brothers Edward and Alphonse after their mother tragically passes. They attempt to use alchemy to resurrect her, but the attempt takes Edward’s arm and leg - and it takes Alphonse’s entire body. Determined to get their bodies restored, Edward and Alphonse try to become State Alchemists so they can find the location of a powerful item known as the Philosopher’s Stone. But their journey ultimately leads them into a seedy world of government corruption and mass genocide.

Japan will release the first live-action adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist . \nFullmetal Alchemist will debut in Japan in December.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:00:26.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
