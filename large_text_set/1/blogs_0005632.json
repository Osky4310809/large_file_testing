1:23 PM Follow @eliseviebeck Confirmation hearings for President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet and other nominees will come fast and furious starting the second week of January. Here’s your guide to the details:\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) WHO: Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.)\nNOMINATED FOR: Attorney general\nWHEN AND WHERE: 9:30 A.M. on Jan. 10, 11 ; Senate Judiciary Committee (Russell Senate Office Building, Room 325)\nARGUMENT FOR: Trump has praised Sessions, a longtime adviser and supporter, as a “world-class legal mind.” First elected in 1996, Sessions previously served as a U.S. attorney and attorney general for Alabama. He has earned praise from Democrats who work with him.\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Accusations of racism have dogged Sessions’s career. He was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 after former colleagues testified he used the n-word and said the Ku Klux Klan were “okay” until he realized they smoked marijuana.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. Here's what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) WHO: Rex Tillerson\nNOMINATED FOR: secretary of State\nWHEN AND WHERE: tentatively scheduled for Jan. 11; Senate Foreign Relations Committee (Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 423)\nARGUMENT FOR: Trump sees Tillerson, who joined ExxonMobil in 1975 and now serves as CEO, as the “embodiment of the American dream.” Trump has praised his “tenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics.” As a global business leader, Tillerson has experience dealing with heads of state around the world, including in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Tillerson has no experience in the public sector, received the Order of Friendship from Russian President Vladimir Putin and brings along potential conflicts of interest from his business career. It’s also unclear whether he supports sanctions against Russia implemented after its U.S. sanctions implemented against Russia in 2014 over its annexation of the Crimea and Moscow’s support for separatists in the Ukraine.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has tapped Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) to be CIA director, close allies say. Here's what we know about him. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) WHO: Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.)\nNOMINATED FOR: CIA director\nWHEN AND WHERE: Jan. 11; Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (Hart Senate Office Building, Room 211)\nARGUMENT FOR: Pompeo, who was elected to the House in 2010, serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, he served as a U.S. Army cavalry officer before founding an aerospace company — a varied record that Trump favors. He was praised as “bright and hard-working” by Democratic colleague Adam Schiff (Calif.).\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Pompeo has no meaningful experience in espionage. He is seen as a fierce partisan on issues like the 2012 Benghazi attacks and the leaks by Edward Snowden, a tendency some CIA veterans fear could bias his judgment.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named Betsy DeVos as his nominee for education secretary. Here's what you need to know about the conservative activist and billionaire donor. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) WHO: Betsy DeVos\nNOMINATED FOR: Education secretary\nWHEN AND WHERE: 10 A.M. on Jan. 11 ; Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 430)\nARGUMENT FOR: To supporters of school voucher programs, DeVos is a champion: a billionaire conservative activist, she has spent millions of programs to expand them around the country. Trump called her a “brilliant and passionate education advocate.”\nARGUMENT AGAINST: DeVos has no professional experience in schools and no traditional experience in education policy. Detractors say her views pose an unprecedented threat to the public school system as a civic institution.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is nominating retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly for secretary of homeland security. Here's what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) WHO: Gen. John Kelly, USMC (Ret.)\nNOMINATED FOR: Homeland Security secretary\nWHEN AND WHERE: 2 P.M. on Jan. 11 ; Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 342)\nARGUMENT FOR: A widely respected and long-serving military officer, Kelly oversaw operations in Central and South America as commander of the U.S. Southern Command. Trump praised him as the “right person to spearhead the urgent mission of stopping illegal immigration” and experienced in stopping drug and human trafficking.\nARGUMENT AGAINST: The choice of Kelly raised questions about Trump’s desire to surround himself with military generals, and Kelly has a blunt manner that can bring him into conflict with other leaders. Detractors have raised concerns about his past comments questioning the Pentagon order opening jobs in combat units to women.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has chosen former labor secretary Elaine Chao to be the next secretary of transportation. Here's what you should know about her. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) WHO: Elaine Chao\nNOMINATED FOR: Transportation secretary\nWHEN AND WHERE: 10:15 A.M. on Jan. 11 ; Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation (Russell Senate Office Building, Room 253)\nARGUMENT FOR: Chao previously served as deputy secretary at the Department of Transportation and secretary of the Department of Labor, giving her expansive insight into the workings of federal bureaucracy. Trump praised her “expertise,” “strong leadership” and personal background as a former immigrant to the United States.\nARGUMENT AGAINST: The nomination of Chao, a consummate Washington insider married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), defies Trump’s promise to surround himself only with people from outside government.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named Wilbur Ross as his nominee for commerce secretary. Here's what you need to know about the billionaire investor. (Monica Akhtar,Osman Malik,Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) WHO: Wilbur Ross\nNOMINATED FOR: Commerce secretary\nWHEN AND WHERE: 10 A.M. on Jan. 12 ; Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation (Russell Senate Office Building, Room 253)\nARGUMENT FOR: Trump praised Ross, a billionaire investor who made his fortune restructuring distressed companies, as a “champion of American manufacturing” and “one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met.” Supporters hope his experience as a turnaround specialist will boost jobs and reinvigorate troubled U.S. industries.\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Ross’s record of buying and restructuring troubled businesses sometimes involved layoffs and budget cuts. He is a hard-line supporter of renegotiating or withdrawing from free trade agreements, a stance that puts him in conflict with free-markets Republican orthodoxy.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named Ben Carson as his nominee for housing and urban development secretary. Here's what you need to know about the former GOP presidential candidate. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) WHO: Ben Carson\nNOMINATED FOR: Housing and Urban Development secretary\nWHEN AND WHERE: 10 A.M. on Jan. 12 ; Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs\nARGUMENT FOR: Carson started his career as a highly accomplished surgeon before turning his attention to politics. His many fans on the conservative right cite cite his religious faith and rags-to-riches personal story as factors behind their support. Trump has called Carson “brilliant” and a “tough competitor.”\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Carson has no experience in public policy and no particular expertise in housing issues. He is known for promoting outlandish theories, including that prison makes inmates gay and that the pyramids were originally constructed to store grain.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is nominating fast-food executive Andrew Puzder as secretary of labor. Here's what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik,Danielle Kunitz,Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) WHO: Andy Puzder\nNOMINATED FOR: Labor secretary\nWHEN AND WHERE: tentatively scheduled for Jan. 12; Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions\nARGUMENT FOR: Puzder, a successful businessman, is CEO of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. Trump said he has “created and boosted the careers of thousands of Americans.”\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Detractors point to Puzder’s opposition to the Affordable Care Act, federal rules that would make more workers eligible for overtime pay and substantially raising the minimum wage to argue he should not lead the Labor Department. His ex-wife accused him of beating her — Puzder denies any physical abuse — in their 1986 divorce proceedings. He has also faced criticism for his company’s use of racy and suggestive advertising.", "external_links": ["http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/1/nomination-hearing", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/12-08-2016/t_1481196975356_name_John_Kelly_Kahn.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/11-18-2016/t_1479496200216_name_80DJRCO1.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/11-23-2016/t_1479930381245_name_20161123_devos_botsford_twp.jpg", "http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-of-general-john-f-kelly-usmc-ret-to-be-secretary-us-department-of-homeland-security", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/11-23-2016/t_1479934393837_name_20161123_carson_trump_endorsement_getty_thumb.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/11-29-2016/t_1480440973939_name_20161129_elainechao_transportation.jpg", "http://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-of-betsy-devos-to-serve-as-secretary-of-education", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/11-18-2016/t_1479489919666_name_2016_11_18T134337Z_1_OV58Z2DPB_RTRMADC_0_USA_TRUMP_ATTORNEYGENERAL.jpg", "https://videos.posttv.com/washpost-production/The_Washington_Post/20161124/583730cee4b015a84b9f1f23/583eef73e4b03735090ba73b_1455589917779-yrd15k_t_1480519649767_640_360_400.gif", "https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=44AB28B5-B8F3-403B-8A67-13067BC0F920", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/12-08-2016/t_1481229166178_name_20161119_AndyPuzder_Trump_Pence_JabinBotsfordWaPothumb.jpg", "http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/01/03/2017/attorney-general-nomination-01-10-17", "https://twitter.com/@eliseviebeck", "http://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=2988BF25-C5F1-45BD-890D-B33125610009", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/12-10-2016/t_1481407286436_name_223190248_1919.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:47:26.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
