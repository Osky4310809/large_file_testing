The S&P 500 has advanced 0.8% to 2,298.70, and the Nasdaq Composite has gained 0.9% to 5,653.05. All three indexes are trading at what would be record highs.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices’ Howard Silverblatt puts Dow 20,000 in context:\nIt appears the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reached and crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time, now we need to hold it, as the bottom-up 1-year target price crosses 21000 for the first time It first closed above 10,000 on March 29, 1999, and was at 936.16 on May 17, 1977, when I started at S&P (Berkshire was at $100 then, and is now $240,940, a 21.7% annualized return)\nThe crossing of 20,000, 64 days after crossing 19,000 (up 5.13%) and 78 days after the election (18,332.74, up 9.09%) is a physiological and emotional point, which investors should use to review their holdings and performance. It is not, in and of itself, a trading point (except for a few momentum short-term traders). The speed of the directional change since the election reflects the change in expected specific forward spending and potential profits, with the emphasis being on “expected”.\nRhino Trading’s Michael Block contends that “the chase may be on.” He explains why:\nWe’re off into uncharted territory and short term, the chase may be on. Yesterday saw a lot of short covering in industrials, transports, and financials and the real money has yet to go to work. Rotations out of U.S. stocks into emerging markets and fixed income in recent days may have been a wrong footed move by allocators, and that will have consequences if this move picks up steam. Yesterday I had concerns that financials and the Russell 2000 were on tenuous support. That’s out the window for the time being.\nEnjoy the ride.\nUPDATE: Instinet’s Frank Cappelleri considers the implications for the the stock market now that the Dow has broken 20,000:\nWith the focus on DJIA 20k, simply staying above the crystal clear breakout level yields a target near 20,300. That’s only 1.1% away from current levels.\nOf greater importance is that there are a fresh 48 of our 150 Key ETFs making new 52 week highs today. That’s an increase from yesterday’s total of 33….\nFurther, according to stockcharts.com, the number of NYSE New 52-Week highs has eclipsed 600 today for the first time since mid-December when the level was near 700 for the three straight sessions (12/7-12/9).\nOne important ETF that has yet to witness a breakout this week is the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLF ). But it’s the best sector today, and it’s done a fine job bouncing near that important 23.00 support line from last week. Could it be next?\nAfter gaining 1.7% to $23.68 today, it just might be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T05:35:28.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
