The perpetually-giggling ex-best friends have been broken up for a while now. But not a word had been spoken by either of them, on their situationship. That was until the endorser of petty, KJo, spelled out his snarkiness in his autobiography, An Unsuitable Boy . \nKaran, who has been unsparing with his words, lately (except for saying the three damned words ) has declared that the actress is history to him. Dead. Over. Crashed and Burnt. This is what he had to say - \n\"It's over. And she can never come back to my life. I don't think she wants to either. I never want to have anything to do with them as a unit. She was the one who mattered to me but now it's over. [...] I wouldn't like to give a piece of myself to her at all because she's killed every bit of emotion I had for her for twenty-five years\" \nIt's heartbreaking to see friends who shared unibrows, amongst other things, be this broken up. Will someone tell Karan that she is your best friend ya? Where is Rahul when you need him?
