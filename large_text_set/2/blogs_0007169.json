From this Sunday, Feb. 12 through Feb. 19—partially in honor of Black History Month—participating restaurants across the city, and a few in the suburbs, will offer specials to highlight Black-owned restaurants which are often overlooked. The list is growing, but so far there’s 26 participants onboard . The rules for Chicago Black Restaurant Week are less rigid than Chicago Restaurant Week, which is going on now through Thursday. The specials will differ at each restaurant; they aren’t required to come up with a special menu. In the spirit of camaraderie, organizers are asking special to end in “17” as in 2017. But that’s totally optional. Seventeen also happened to be the number of restaurants that participated in last year’s promotion, which was also in February. Organizer and social media consultant Lauran Smith was inspired by Negro History Week, the precursor to Black History Week. Last year, Smith told Eater that she didn’t care about geography, as segregation plagues the city from North and South sides. It didn’t matter where a Black-owned business stood, she hoped her promotion could help support all Black-owned restaurants. Chicago Black Restaurant Week isn’t affiliated with the city’s tourism arm, Choose Chicago, the organizer of Chicago Restaurant Week. Check out the list which includes new participants like Bin 36 in the West Loop and Cracked at 695 in River West. The Tribune first reported the news.
