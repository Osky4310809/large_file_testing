Both those school boards unanimously approved the measure after the “Day Without Immigrant” walkouts and teachers expressing concerns about losing their jobs for helping students with deportation questions. \nThe school board meeting is expected to have a big turnout. \nWhile the district says their mission is to prepare all students for success in college, career, and community leadership, the possible sanctuary designation has divided some parents… right down party lines. \nA letter went out to local Democrats urging them to speak tonight. It said many were concerned about a GOP plan to flood the meeting with opponents to the resolution. \nThe Tarrant County Republican Party issued a statement last week encouraging people to educate themselves on the issue and to sign up for a speaking slot. \nThe school board meeting will be held at the FWISD Board Complex located at 2903 Shotts Street and begins at 5:30 p.m. \n(© Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
