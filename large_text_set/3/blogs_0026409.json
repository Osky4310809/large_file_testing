Both teenagers were apprehended by Border Patrol officers shortly after crossing the southern border and then turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as is required by federal law. \nHHS then released Montano, from El Salvador, and Sanchez Milian, from Guatemala, to their guardians in Maryland, where they were enrolled in public school. Less than a year later, police say, they took turns sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a bathroom at Rockville High. \nThe case has drawn attention to a number of questions surrounding illegal immigration and border security. Critics of national immigration policy have blasted authorities for accepting increasing numbers of unaccompanied children who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border, most of them from Central American countries.

The number of Central Americans detained surpassed Mexicans for the first time ever in 2014 and again in 2016. \nOfficials say border agents issued Montano and Sanchez Milian notices to appear in immigration court, the Post reported, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which initiates deportation proceedings, never filed charges against Sanchez Milian. Under ICE policy, Sanchez Milian was not a priority for deportation because he did not have a known criminal record or gang affiliation. \nThe Trump administration revised immigration enforcement policy last month, expanding the categories of illegal immigrants that would be subject to deportation proceedings. A fact sheet released by DHS in February said ICE “will not exempt classes or categories of removal aliens from potential enforcement” and that “those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to enforcement proceedings, up to and including removal from the United States.” \nSend tips to [email protected] .
