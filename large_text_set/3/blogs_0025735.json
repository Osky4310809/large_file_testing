It was a song about death and cigarettes, Baker taking a step back and staring at her own morbid fixations, her voice crackling out of whispers and fighting over the repetition. There was a sense that it could have gone either way: succumbing to the clatter, or gently rising out of some impending chaos. \nThis afternoon, Baker released a re-recorded version of \"Good News\" as the 62nd installment in the consistently fascinating Our First 100 Days series. This time, there's no layered guitar or insistent harmony; it's just Baker and a piano, delicately smashing your heart into a thousand pieces with a small, ornate hammer. \nListen to the track below and read our Noisey Next feature on Baker right here . \nFollow Noisey on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:20:09.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
