Mixing comedy with the same sardonic tone the books were known for, the series is something unique for viewers. Featuring a transformative turn from Neil Patrick Harris as the villainous Count Olaf, and the series was luckily met with positive reviews from both fans and critics alike.\nWith some strong early reviews and a word-of-mouth going for it, the first, 8-episode season of the series premiered last Friday on the streaming service, and despite Netflix’s notoriously secretive ratings, it looks like the viewership numbers for the series have already been revealed (kind of).\nAs reported by TheWrap , A Series of Unfortunate Events managed to beat fellow Netflix original Marvel’s Luke Cage in its first weekend, according to Symphony Advanced Media. The show currently sits behind Fuller House season 1, Orange is the New Black season 4, and Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life in terms of its three-day viewership numbers, though, since Symphony has only been tracking Netflix’s numbers for the past year and a half or so, it’s possible the series could also be behind some of the streaming service’s past original seasons of TV.\nDuring the Live +3 Day period, the report states A Series of Unfortunate Events was viewed by 3.755 million adults 18-49 over the average minute, just slightly above Luke Cage ‘s reported 3.388 million.\nNow, make sure to take all of this with a grain of salt for the time being, since Netflix itself doesn’t actually officially release its internal viewership numbers. On that same note, these preliminary ratings are unstable and subject to adjustment, so it’s also extremely possible that A Series of Unfortunate Events could either show a drop or increase in its numbers by the time everything is said and done. Still, though, it seems fair to say that the streaming service’s ambitious book-to-screen adaptation has emerged as yet another success.\nAs most fans are already likely aware, the show’s first season covers the first four out of the total thirteen books in the Lemony Snicket series, ending with The Miserable Mill . While the season ends in a way that could cap off the entire series, it also gives the story an open-ended feel at the same time, as it briefly teases the events and characters of the next book in the series, The Austere Academy . It’s not surprising, then, to know that work on a second season has apparently already begun , and it seems like with these opening weekend numbers, it’s only a matter of time before fans can expect to return to the show’s world once again.\nA Series of Unfortunate Events season 1 is available in its entirety on Netflix.\nSource: TheWrap", "external_links": ["http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/series-unfortunate-events-2017-poster-netflix.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/series-unfortunate-events-2017-poster-netflix.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/series-unfortunate-events-2017-poster-netflix.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=548&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/series-unfortunate-events-2017-poster-netflix.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/series-unfortunate-events-2017-poster-netflix.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=473&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/series-unfortunate-events-2017-poster-netflix.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=590&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/series-unfortunate-events-2017-poster-netflix.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://www.thewrap.com/lemony-snickets-series-of-unfortunate-events-tv-ratings/", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/series-unfortunate-events-2017-poster-netflix.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1417&h=709&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-19T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T10:44:27.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
