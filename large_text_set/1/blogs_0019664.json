There are plenty of free and paid FTP clients available. In this article, we have hand-picked some of the best FTP clients for WordPress beginners. The goal here is to find the most reliable, secure, and easy to use FTP tool for all your WordPress file editing and uploads.\n\nWhat is an FTP Client? Why You Need it? FTP (File Transfer Protocol) allows you to upload files from your computer to your WordPress site. In order to use FTP, you will need an FTP client which is a desktop app that connects your computer to your WordPress hosting account.\nIt provides an easy to use graphics user interface, so that you can perform all FTP functions such as copy, upload, delete, rename, and edit files / folders on your WordPress site. \nIt is not necessary to install an FTP client to use WordPress. However, an FTP client can help you quickly fix common WordPress errors when you are not able to access WordPress admin area . \nHow to Use an FTP Client? You will need a FTP username and password in order to connect to your WordPress site. \nThis information can be found in the email you got when you first started your blog and signed up for a web hosting account. \nYou can also get this information from your web hosting cPanel dashboard or ask the support, and they will email it to you. \nOnce you have this information, you can connect to your website. \nFirst, you will need to launch your FTP client and enter your FTP username, password, host (usually your website address e.g. wpbeginner.com), and then click on the connect button. \n\nHost is usually your website’s URL (e.g. wpbeginner.com). \nIf you do not enter anything in the port field, then your FTP client will connect using the plain FTP protocol on port 21. \nYou can use port 22 to connect to your server using SFTP which encrypts information before sending it to your web server. This reduces the chances of hackers stealing your FTP password or sniffing on information. \nHaving said that, let’s take a look at some of the best FTP clients available for WordPress users on different platforms. \nBest FTP Clients for WordPress Users There are several paid and free FTP clients available for different platforms and operating systems.
