It’s an action that takes creativity and planning and lots of forethought. Of course, you’re reading this the day before Valentine’s Day, so you’re striking out in at least two of those three of those categories, but still, you’re trying, so we’re gonna pass on some advice from one of the greatest cooking authorities we know: Michelin-star chef Gordon Ramsay. In a recent Reddit AMA , Ramsay was asked the best dish to cook for someone on a first date. His answer was simple and versatile and easy to read in a British accent: pasta. \n“Pasta is a great way to show some great flair, whether it’s dry spaghetti or even fresh-made Tagliatelle pasta,” Ramsay said. “I would start it off with a sort of roasted shallot, garlic, chili, fresh lime juice, with flaked crab meat over it. If you really want to be the ultimate single guy, looking for the most extreme date, crank a little pasta machine, sit her down, serve her the most amazing glass of champagne, and just tell to sit and watch for five minutes.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:30:54.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
