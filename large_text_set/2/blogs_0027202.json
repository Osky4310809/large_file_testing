You get less than half the regular portions. Instead, order a bowl with whatever you want in it. Then ask for the taco shells, hard or soft, on the side. When I was there, the shells were free to get on the side.”—KourageWolf 4/12 Chick-Fil-A Chick-Fil-A Don’t order grilled foods if you’re gluten free. While technically gluten free, a lot of cross contamination can occur. Be specific to be safe. Oh, and don’t order a standard salad at night, it was probably made that morning. Request something else on it, and it’ll be fresh.”—SwagSorcerer 5/12 McDonald's Mc’Donalds \n“When I worked there in Canada, McDonald’s grilled chicken could sit there for a long time—so can the filet-o-fish. Usually they’re on top of it but s*** happens. Don’t be afraid to order those fresh if you worry it might be stale. Same with regular burger patties, they take like 40 seconds, it’s no big deal. I’ve done a 4 hour shift and just forgot to throw out the old grilled chicken and make new ones because nobody ordered it, and it had already went past the timer when I got on, so there was no beeping to remind me. It sounds stupid and it was. We're all human and humans are dumb, though. \nWhat you should order is fresh grilled chicken (Edit: Takes about 7 to 10 minutes, though!). I used to time grilled chicken for my breaks because it was just that good. Also, fresh cookies: Super gooey chocolate, soft and warm.”—CaseyTwist 6/12 Wendy's Wendy’s \n“My brother’s girlfriend used to work at Wendy’s and a saying there (about the fries) was: “They aren’t old until they’re sold.”—Wrinklestiltskin 7/12 Dairy Queen Dairy Queen “Salads from DQ are a rip off. They just recently down-sized them while changing the bowl to make it look like the same amount. Over $5 for 3 ounces of old lettuce, cabbage, carrots, and even older grilled chicken.”—obeyyourbrain 8/12 Sonic Sonic Drive-In \n“Don’t get the chili. It comes in a bag, gets warmed up in a metal tub, and then sits for 10 hours until we run out and replace it. It’s also just not very good to begin with.”—AntProtein 9/12 Carl's Jr. Carl’s Jr./Hardee’s “Chicken Tenders. We were supposed to throw them out after 20 minutes. We were told not to do that. We would sometimes serve 1 to 2 hour old tenders.
