The remaining miles have been accumulated since 2005.\nLastly, the vehicles comes with two sets of tools in the front deck, owner’s manuals and warranty booklet in their leather folio, wheel socket, car cover in bag, both the removable hardtop and emergency soft top with bag, utility light, window sticker, the “circus trunk” containing roll bars, and a carbon rear tonneau cover.\nThis 1995 Ferrari F50 heads to auction on March 11.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:32:31.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
