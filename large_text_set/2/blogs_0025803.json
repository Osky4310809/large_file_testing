Meet the special-edition Vantage S Red Bull Racing Editions. Okay, so Red Bull–logoed V8 and V12 Vantages pale in comparison to the AM-RB 001, but as far as paint-and-badge jobs go, they’re mighty attractive. \n-Aston Martin’s Q personalization arm handles the creation of the Red Bull Racing Editions, applying the deep Mariana Blue paint seen here (Tungsten Silver also is available), as well as the delicate red trim around the grille and fender vents, a liberal helping of carbon-fiber trim, and yellow-painted brake calipers. Q also will flip this color scheme, replacing the red bits with yellow-colored pieces and painting the brake calipers red. Inside, Red Bull Racing patches are embroidered on each headrest and more carbon fiber is added. Needless to say, it all nicely dresses up the nearly decade-old Vantage.\n- \n-The only choices left to lucky buyers—and Aston isn’t saying how many cars there will be to go around—are whether to stick with the V8 Vantage or spring for the 12-cylinder model and which Red Bull Racing Formula 1 driver’s signature they want on a doorsill-mounted plaque. Take your pick between Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo, and that driver will personally sign the plaque. There’s no word on whether this popularity contest will bum out the driver whose pen is requested less, but the flourish certainly is a neat perk for the buyer.\n- - - 2017 Aston Martin DB11 First Drive: An Ode to the Past - Aston Martin Vanquish S Knows It’s Hot, Takes Off Its Top - Aston Martin Vantage Research: Full Pricing, Specs, Reviews, and More - - -More details, including pricing, will be released closer to the cars’ springtime on-sale date, but Aston Martin encourages interested parties to contact a dealer sooner rather than later.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:52:06.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
