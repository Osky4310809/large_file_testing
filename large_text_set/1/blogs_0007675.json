Jeff Sessions’ confirmation hearing for U.S. Attorney General has been the number of protesters. Perhaps most memorably so far, not only were there the protesters mockingly wearing Ku Klux Klan robes , but at about 10:15 a.m. ET, a few men started chanting “NO TRUMP, NO KKK, NO FASCIST USA!” and one of the them continued yelling about racism as well as an anti-Trump event on Saturday. They were handcuffed and removed somewhat roughly by police. If something happened that necessitated them being handcuffed when other protesters were not, it was not caught on camera. \nBarely a minute later, another protester, a woman wearing a pink coat, yelled about Sessions being a “pig” and promoted the event scheduled for Saturday, as well. The clothing may indicate that like some other protesters, she was representing anti-war group Codepink . \nMeanwhile, Frank Thorp of NBC News tweeted this photo of what looks like a bag of items confiscated from protesters, including bullhorns: A Capitol Police grab-bag of supplies for protesters at @SenatorSessions ' confirmation hearing is sitting in the hallway: pic.twitter.com/NmcjOat0ei \n— Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) January 10, 2017 \nWe will add more protester videos as we get them, but in the meantime, here’s the clip of the protesters dressed as Sessions’ KKK “fans” if you missed it earlier: \nHave a tip we should know?
