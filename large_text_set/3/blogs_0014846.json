They basically brought us along, too, because the family documented the whole thing on Instagram and Snapchat (per usual), and we gotta say, we're this close to buying plane tickets. \nIt's not the first time Teigen and Legend have headed to Morocco on vacation—they went two years ago for Legend's birthday. But it's the first trip for Luna, and it looks like the vacation was just as delightful for her as it was for the grown-ups. \nBelow, see all of the photos of their family trip: \nHere's Teigen and Luna exploring the souks. Loading \nTeigen really let her hair out down, bringing just one extension with her, to Atkins' incredulity... Loading \n...but still got her hair done. Loading \nReal talk: Riads are gorgeous. Loading \nThe boys played with reptiles, and Teigen didn't really understand why. Loading \nObviously a Moroccan vacation with Teigen wouldn't be a vacation at all without some delicious food. Loading \nWe would gladly eat these leftovers. Loading \nLuna also got in some \"light reading\"... Loading \n...and pulled a face with her dad. Loading \nShe also tested out a rug. Loading \nUnfortunately, it seems, some rare rain spoiled some of the family's fun. (Stars: They're just like us and also have technical difficulties at super inconvenient times).
