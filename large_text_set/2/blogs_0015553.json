Under a 1968 law, being judged a “ mental defective ” because you lack the mental capacity to manage your own affairs disqualifies you from buying a gun. \nWhat could make more sense than requiring a federal agency, which has those names, to follow the law and submit them to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ? \nThe Republican mantra has long been that instead of passing new gun control laws, the nation should enforce the ones on the books. And as Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said during a gun debate in 2013 , \"We should embrace realistic, effective solutions to the mental health problem because no one I know believes that a mentally ill person should be able to purchase a firearm.” ACLU: Gun control laws should be fair \nBut when they had the chance, Senate Republicans — joined by four Democrats and one independent who are up for re-election next year — saluted the NRA and killed the policy approved during Obama’s waning days in office. The House did the same earlier this month. \nFor years, failure to submit the names of people who are banned from buying guns because of certain mental illnesses has been a major gap in the system, rendering the database useless in many cases. \nSeparating the seriously mentally ill from guns is a worthy goal, and one that the public favors . \nFinding the right way to do it isn’t easy, and going too far can wrongly stigmatize everyone who suffers from mental illness. The overwhelming majority of people with mental illness are not violent . Nor is mental illness a predictor of gun violence. \nBut it is also true that many of the young men responsible for some of the worst massacres in recent years have suffered from mental problems. Virginia Tech’s Seung Hui Cho, who killed 32, was delusional. Jared Loughner, killer of six at a Tucson shopping mall, scared classmates at a community college with his bizarre behavior. The accused mass shooter at the Fort Lauderdale airport last month went to the FBI in Anchorage last year, agitated and delusional and begging for help. Instead, authorities made sure that the gun they seized from him was given back . \nCertain types of mental illness are also closely associated with suicide, which accounts for six out of 10 firearm fatalities in America. Perhaps the Social Security policy would have done more to prevent suicide than mass murder — certainly a goal worth achieving. \nJoining the NRA in opposing the policy were disability and civil rights groups concerned the policy was too broad and would stereotype too many innocent people. Republican leaders latched onto that as an excuse for repeal. \nIn a perfect world, the rules could be more finely tuned. But in the real world, where mass murders, though rare, still occur and where 21,000 people committed suicide with a gun in 2014, the real crime is a government agency knowing who, by law, is banned from buying a gun, but doing nothing about it. \nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board , separate from the news staff.
