But now, Dini is returning to Harley with a new set of stories for one of his most famous creations. Advertisement \nAnnounced through DC’s solicits for April , Dini—who returned to DC Comics last year to pen a graphic novel about a horrendous real-life assault he experienced during his time on Batman: The Animated Series —will join the creative team of the Harley Quinn ongoing from the book’s 17th issue for a new supplementary story kicking off in the comics. Dini will co-write, with series writer Jimmy Palmiotti, “Harley Loves Joker,” a back-up story that will follow Harley’s early days at the side of the clown prince of crime. Brett Blevins will provide art for the back-up story. \nThere’s currently no word on how long Dini will write back up stories for the series—whether he’s just back for one story or it’s an ongoing arrangement—but considering it’s been a while since we’ve seen Dini write Harley in the comics, it’ll be interesting to see. Harley Quinn #17 is scheduled to release April 5th.
