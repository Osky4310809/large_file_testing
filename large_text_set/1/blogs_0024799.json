Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool are set to miss out on 17-year-old Inter Milan wonderkid Andrea Pinamonti with Inter Milan reportedly ready to offer the striker a new deal. \nPinamoni has been training with the first-team squad for the last couple of months after a blistering start to the campaign for Inter's youth team. \nHe has 14 goals in 13 games for the club's Primavera and would be keen to sign fresh terms with his boyhood side, according to Calciomercato. \nSpurs are also said to be tracking the starlet. Coutinho: I can be Anfield legend Coutinho wants to go down in Reds folklore (Photo: Liverpool FC/Getty Images) \nPhilippe Coutinho says he hopes to go down in Liverpool history alongside a host of Anfield icons after signing his new contract. \nThe Brazilian playmaker, 24, this week tied his future to the Reds, inking a £150,000-a-week deal with the club, writes Mirror Football's Alex Richards. \n\"Wait to sign? No. No. Now is the right time,” insisted Coutinho, speaking to the Daily Mail. \"I understand what Liverpool means. We can say Dalglish, Rush, Hansen, Souness, Suarez, Gerrard. I've been here quite a few years already, it's not like I am new. I understand. \n\"To have signed a new contract at this club, my goal is to be thought of one day in the same way as these players. They are legends. You define the success of a player by his loyalty or his titles. Or both. In order to be part of this group, I have so much to do. \n\"I want to win titles. Five years is my new contract - it gives me that opportunity.\" Klopp responds to criticisms of his training Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T10:58:29.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
