Regardless of political views or party affiliation, the very foundations of our democracy depend on fair voting practices.\"\nWhen first confronted about his double vote, Gidcumb reportedly said he thought he had participated in two separate elections, according to WYFF. Later he changed his story and said he forgot that he had voted on March 3.\nTo undermine his defense, the prosecuting attorneys highlighted the fact that Gidcumb had voted in every primary and general election since 1996. He was also the chairman of his local precinct at one point.\nGidcumb's conviction comes amid renewed claims from the White House that millions of people voted illegally on Nov. 8, costing Donald Trump the popular vote.\nDuring an appearance on ABC's \"This Week,\" Trump advisor Stephen Miller was asked whether the president had any evidence to support his recent claim that thousands of people voted illegally in New Hampshire, having been bused in from Massachusetts.\n\"I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who's worked in New Hampshire politics. It's very real. It's very serious,\" Miller said, according to NPR.\nWhen pressed by the show's host to present evidence, Miller said it was \"not the venue\" to do so.\nIn response to Trump's claim, the Federal Election Commission published a statement calling on his administration to prove the allegation.\n\"The President has issued an extraordinarily serious and specific charge. Allegations of this magnitude cannot be ignored,\" the statement read, according to the Boston Globe. \"I therefore call upon President Trump to immediately share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thoroughly.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T19:21:00.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
