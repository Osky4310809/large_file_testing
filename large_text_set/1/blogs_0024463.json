Bastian Schweinsteiger scored his first Old Trafford goal for Manchester United against Wigan on Sunday \nMourinho said: \"Yes, he is staying. He is going to in the Europa League list because we opened spaces with (Memphis) Depay and (Morgan) Schneiderlin (leaving). \n\"We don't have many players, and we don't have many options in midfield. Ninety minutes (against Wigan) was probably too for Bastian, from minutes 65-70 it was hard for him but now I think he is happy. \n\"He was a good professional when he was not playing, and after having some minutes he will be the same. With so many competitions and games he will be an option.\" \nMourinho deflected a question about captain Wayne Rooney, after reports emerged in the national newspapers this weekend that he is the subject of negotiations over a move to China. Wayne Rooney was presented with an award by Sir Bobby Charlton after breaking Manchester United's goalscoring record \nBut the Portuguese made sure label his club's fixture schedule as \"nonsense\" after thrashing the Latics at Old Trafford. \n\"We are going to have a very difficult season compared with other clubs. Liverpool will play 16 matches until the end of the season, Chelsea will play 16 plus some in the FA Cup, and we are in this really crazy situation,\" he said. \n\"Southampton will have 15 days without football before the final. We are going to play two matches against Saint-Etienne and the next round of the FA Cup, so the calendar in the best country of world football is nonsense.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T23:12:34.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
