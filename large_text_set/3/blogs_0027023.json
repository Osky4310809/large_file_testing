In the print version, the headline was \"Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides,\" although you're going to have to squint to read the acknowledgment of the print headline at the bottom of the page.\nStill, if you look through the actual article, you'll find this paragraph:\nThe F.B.I. is leading the investigations, aided by the National Security Agency, the C.I.A. and the Treasury Department’s financial crimes unit. The investigators have accelerated their efforts in recent weeks but have found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing, the officials said. One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House.\nOn March 4, Trump tweeted:\nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\nThis, of course, has been the subject of lots of Claude Rains since then, as reporters and politicians announce they're shocked, shocked at that accusation.\nI've written about this before here and here , and I won't go through the whole argument again as I'm not paid by the word, but the really inescapable conclusion was that either the New York Times reporting was false, or Trump was justified. The real question was identifying who in the Obama administration (or in the upper-level civil service staff) had been responsible for leaking information that identified a \"US Person\" -- and would they be prosecuted for what appear to be felonious violations of 18USC793 and 50USC1801.\nIf anyone. We know from the Clinton email scandal that the Espionage Act has an unwritten \"except for Democrat politicians\" exception. So this morning, Charlie Savage tweeted a criticism of the Wall Street Journal's editorial:\nRe \"fake president\" editorial, why can't WSJ ed board grasp that FBI wiretap targeted Russian ambassador, not Flynn? https://t.co/4Alc56JQGl pic.twitter.com/MlwkNqr0i9\n— Charlie Savage (@charlie_savage) March 22, 2017\nI thought this was a little odd, and followed up:\nWhy can't you grasp that NYT, WaPo reported multiple times on Trump-insider intercepts? Were they lying? https://t.co/f3LmOLh7Pf\n— (((Charlie Martin))) (@chasrmartin) March 22, 2017\nFrom which we got to this:\n@chasrmartin A talks to B. B is a surveillance target. Govt ends up with intercept involving A, even though A was not targeted. Get it?\n— Charlie Savage (@charlie_savage) March 22, 2017\nThis strikes me as silly and disingenuous: it's the same old \"well, it wasn't really a wiretap and it wasn't really a wiretap of Trump\" defense.\nNow, after a lot of talk during hearings on Monday that no one saw evidence that Trump had been wiretapped, today Devin Nunes announced (quoting from his press release ):\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/22/dems-claim-trump-team-not-wiretapped-while-wiretapped/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://t.co/4Alc56JQGl", "https://twitter.com/charlie_savage/status/844555516043051008", "https://t.co/f3LmOLh7Pf", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/us/politics/trump-obama-tap-phones.html?mtrref=myaccount.nytimes.com&_r=0&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=489672D08AFADCCB2A677542710B8965&gwt=pay", "https://twitter.com/chasrmartin", "https://t.co/MlwkNqr0i9", "https://twitter.com/chasrmartin/status/844552822175793153", "https://twitter.com/charlie_savage/status/844548832075677696", "http://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=774", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html"], "published": "2017-03-22T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:26:39.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
