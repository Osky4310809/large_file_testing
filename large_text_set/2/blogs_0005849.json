Thirteen genealogy scrolls were used to trace the family and find all the people they possibly could to bring together. \nThese family members are from the 25th to 31st generations of Rens. They believe that there are more than 1,000 people still alive from the Ren family. \nRen Tuanjie is trying to document them all, especially those who left the village. \nThe photos show a relatively orderly scene for the 500-person family reunion. Ren Tuanjie set up the picture himself, shouting instructions through a portable speaker. \nAll in all, it took about 30 minutes to get the pictures taken. \nThe family reunion photos were taken at the village. The Ren family posed by the basalt formations at the village.

It seemed impressive. \nBut seeing this Ren family reunion 10 times the size of my own, our paltry 50 people doesn’t seem quite as impressive anymore. \nNo matter the size of your family, though, it’s the closeness that matters, not the numbers.
