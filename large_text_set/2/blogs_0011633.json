Ashton Kutcher, co-founder of Thorn, at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Wednesday in Washington, D.C. Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call Inc. \nSeveral law enforcement agencies have used a beta version of Thorn's software to prioritize their case loads and cut down investigation time, Kutcher said. Many agencies are severely understaffed and under-resourced when it comes to human trafficking, and technology can make their jobs easier, he said. \nOne of the organization's programs, Spotlight, shortens investigations from three years to three weeks, Kutcher said. \n\"The technology we're building is efficient, nimble [and] enduring, and it only gets smarter with time,\" he said. \nThe committee was especially interested in hearing how Thorn's technology could unmask traffickers who use the web to protect their anonymity. \nRelated: Watch Ashton Kutcher Blow a Kiss to John McCain at Senate Hearing \n\"It's taking the internet, which is largely anonymous, and making it far less anonymous,\" he told Sen Marco Rubio, R-Florida. Spotlight reaches out to victims and calculates priorities and accuracy in getting them out, he said. \nKutcher also pressed the importance of fostering public and private partnerships, saying many companies \"want to do the right thing\" and have already offered not only funds but also pro bono services to combat traffickers who are \"continuously changing their modus operandi .\" \nPrivate companies bring different resources to the table, so it is vital to take advantage of every resource, he said. \nKutcher also recommended addressing the \"pipelines\" to trafficking — taking a deeper look at the foster care system, which he said was a \"breeding ground\" for abuse, as well as increasing mental health services. \nCommittee member Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, called human trafficking a \"scourge on humanity,\" which he said is why he was particularly concerned about President Donald Trump's executive order to limit immigration.
