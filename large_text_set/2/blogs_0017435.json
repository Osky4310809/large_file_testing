The doctor said he’d written two previous letters to Smith but never mailed them.\n“He graduated from Temple U. with a degree in Dramatic Arts. Presently, the writing of screen-plays is his creative focus as his priority has become the needs of his son,” Gosnell wrote about his son.\n“Like father, like son, may be the pattern. At any rate, David never approved of my drafts to request assistance in your mutual profession.”\nA rep for Smith could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday.\nA Thomas Jefferson spokeswoman said she was not able to immediately verify or dispute any of Gosnell’s claims.\nDr. Gosnell’s clinic AP The Mail said it obtained Gosnell’s letter through writer Phelim McAleer, co-author of “Gosnell: The Untold Story of America’s Most Prolific Serial Killer.” \nMcAleer said he believes Gosnell’s claims about delivering Smith.\n“Everything he told us for the book checks out,” McAleer said. “He has a huge memory for details.”\nGosnell was sentenced to life in prison, without the possibility of parole, in 2013 for the murder of three babies born alive after botched abortions at his filthy, unsanitary clinic.\nGosnell didn’t make any specific requests of Smith in his letter, but railed against America’s criminal justice system.\n“My contention is that a politician, relevant for people of color, need be fluent with issues which include: mental health capitation, the public and pharmacology industry’s over-emphasis on `magic bullets’, intuitive judgements, unconscious attitudes, implicit bias, cognitive bias, acceptable deception and planned deceit. Personally, I have confidence in eventual vindication as so many gross errors occurred in my proceedings,” Gosnell wrote.\nThe doctor also claimed to know Smith’s older sister Pamela and wanted to check in on her – although Gosnell called her “Patricia” in the letter.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:12:50.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
