Lift your right hand, scoop the ball, and start dribbling as you balance yourself on your left arm. Dribble the ball for about 30 seconds, making sure your core is tight; then switch arms and repeat. Time: 1 minute \n2. Split Squat Ball Dribble Grab a basketball and assume a split stance position. Your feet should be about 3 feet apart. Lower your body until your front knee is bent roughly 90 degrees. Hold the position for 60 seconds, dribbling the ball back and forth between your legs throughout. Switch legs at the 1-minute mark. Time: 2 minutes \n3. Ball Mountain Climber Pushup Assume a pushup position with your left hand on the floor and right hand on the ball. Now do mountain climbers: Bring your left knee into your body and then back to the start. Repeat with your right knee. Keep going, doing a pushup every 3 to 5 seconds. Do that for 30 seconds, then switch hands. Time: 1 minute \n4. Side-to-Side Squat Dribble Grab a basketball and assume a superwide stance. Start dribbling the ball. Shift your weight onto your left hip as you dribble to the left, moving into a side lunge. Reverse the move, dribbling to the right and moving into a right-side lunge.
