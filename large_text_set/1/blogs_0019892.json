Bush, Barbara Bush Since Hospitalization by Josh Feldman | 6:56   \nA spokesman for George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush posted the first photo of the former president and first lady since their recent hospitalization. \nThe 41st president was hospitalized over a week ago for shortness of breath, while Mrs. Bush was hospitalized on the same day for bronchitis. \nAs of today, she has been discharged from the hospital and her husband is now out of the ICU. Initially Barbara Bush was told she could be discharged yesterday, but she decided to stay and be with her husband. \nSpokesman Jim McGrath posted this photo today of the couple together, thanking everyone for their prayers and expressions of love: President and Mrs @GeorgeHWBush thank their fellow Americans and friends from around the world for their prayers and good wishes. pic.twitter.com/PhpXXGKl6p \n— Jim McGrath (@jgm41) January 23, 2017 \n[ featured image via Jim McGrath ] \n—— \nHave a tip we should know?
