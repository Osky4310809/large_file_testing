Image credit: Taco Bell --- Shares February 15, 2017 \nIf you’re feeling pretty secure in your relationship post-Valentine’s Day, here’s an idea of how to take the next step. It involves a potentially regret-filled trip to Las Vegas, but hear us out. \nThis week, Taco Bell announced that it is opening a wedding chapel in its flagship Las Vegas Cantina restaurant. You could win the very first Taco Bell wedding by entering its Love and Tacos Contest. \nRelated: 20 Facts You Probably Didn't Know About Taco Bell \nFor consideration, couples must create a 30-second Instagram video explaining how Taco Bell has played a role in their love story. The contest ends on Feb. 26, and on March 1, Taco Bell fans will vote for their favorites. \nThe winning couple will receive six tickets to Las Vegas, catered dinner at the Las Vegas Cantina location, all manner of Taco Bell wedding branded merch -- including a bow tie, garter, T-shirts and champagne flutes -- and a professional photographer or videographer. \nRelated: Taco Bell to Have 9,000 U.S. Outlets by the End of 2022 \nAfter the winning couple says “I do,” they’ll stay in a room at Planet Hollywood, where they’ll have private pool access. They’ll also get a VIP table at Drai’s Nightclub and two tickets to the High Roller ferris wheel at the LINQ Hotel and Casino. \nEven if you don’t win the first blessed event at the restaurant, starting later this year, all the romance of a Taco Bell wedding could be yours for a competitive $600 that will get you an ordained officiant, a Taco 12 pack, a Cinnabon Delights cake and a sauce packet bouquet to use during the ceremony. Based on that language, we don’t think you can keep the bouquet, but you will score a sauce packet garter and tie, along with a couple of “Just Married” T-shirts. Can you feel the love (and queso) in the air? Nina Zipkin Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.
