This is about saving lives. This is about preventing needless injury and death,” the attorney general told WBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Bernice Corpuz. \nHealey last year announced a crackdown on so-called “copycat” assault weapons being sold in the state. The Massachusetts Gun Owners Action League is fighting the crackdown in court. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
