The shade is a silky green color that's more earthy than minty. Still, it's neutral enough to work beautifully in a modern kitchen filled with white tiles and stainless steel appliances.The Avocado Green will be the latest option for KitchenAid's Artisan Mini stand mixer line ($400) and will be available to purchase in July. Advertisement \nJoining the Artisan Series are Black Violet and Ink Blue. Both shades are so deeply pigmented they almost appear black . The deep hues are highly indulgent and offer an alternative to folks who can't imagine Ocean Drive in their kitchen but still want a hint of personality on their countertops. Both Black Violent and Ink Blue, which is inspired by classic ink blue glaze on white bone china, are available in the Artisan Series 5 Quart stand mixer ($430). Ink Blue will be available in July, and Black Violet will follow shortly after in September. \nYou May Also Be Interested In: \nA second food-inspired color, Milkshake, is an off-white shade that's warmer than the iconic White but still clean enough for a permanent place on your countertop. Milkshake will be available in both the Artisan Series 5 Quart ($430) and Pro 600 Series 6 Quart stand mixer ($570) beginning in July. \n\"The kitchen is a key place for cooks to play and experiment with favorite new and trending colors,\" said Jessica McConnell, Senior Manager of Color, Finish, and Material Design for KitchenAid in a statement . \"Our ever-expanding small appliance color and finish offerings provides consumers even more freedom to curate and enliven kitchen countertops.\" More from Southern Living", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:06:24.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
