It’s not really news that Amy Poehler is one of our favorite human beings. She’s kind, intelligent, and hilarious AF (and anyone who’s starred in both Parks and Rec AND Wet Hot American Summer is comedy royalty in our book). So we’re super happy to hear that Poehler is dating lawyer Benjamin Gaff , and that things seem to be going really well.\nYou might remember that Poehler was married to Arrested Development alum Will Arnett for nine years (and that they have two sons together), but that they split in 2012 . Poehler wrote about the experience in her book, Yes Please , saying:\n“Getting a divorce really sucks. Imagine spreading everything you care about on a blanket and then tossing the whole thing up in the air. The process of divorce is about loading that blanket, throwing it up, watching it all spin and worrying what stuff will break when it lands.” She also dated fellow comedian Nick Kroll from 2013-2015, but things reportedly didn’t work out with their conflicting schedules. So after all of that, we’re super happy for Poehler!\nGaff is an attorney at a New York City law firm, and his bio says, “When he is not trying to be an inventor himself, Ben enjoys Ultimate Frisbee, tennis, cooking and exploring new cities and countries.” Sounds like a nice dude, if we do say so ourselves! And according to Us , this has been going on for a while now (they were spotted hiking this past May).\nWe’re wishing Amy all the happiness in the world, because, well, she brings us so much happiness. Oh, and we also can’t wait for the many projects she has coming down the pipeline — not least of which is Netflix’s Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later .\nvia GIPHY  \nThank you television gods!
