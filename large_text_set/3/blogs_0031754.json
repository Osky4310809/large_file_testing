But if you ask a professional makeup artist about their favorite brushes, their answers are decidedly ho-hum (albeit far more classic, refined, and time-tested). The following are the fluffiest, sharpest, softest, and most precise brushes that makeup artists swear by today. Photo: Jane Kim/ Allure Best Cream Eye Shadow Brush “The Stila #11 Concealer Brush is designed to be a concealer brush, but I actually use it to apply cream eye shadow. The synthetic brush has a long, flat tip, which is ideal for packing color onto the eyelid.” —Wendy Rowe, who has worked with Christy Turlington, Sienna Miller, and Victoria Beckham $20 ( amazon.com ). Best Winged Liner Brush \"I use the Kevyn Aucoin Concealer Brush for everything, but mostly for blending eyeliner into the lash line. It's meant to be a concealer brush and excels at it, but it also does a great job cleaning up lip lines or doing a strong cat eye.\" —Fiona Stiles, who has worked with Lily Collins, Elizabeth Banks, and Gabrielle Union Courtesy of brand Best Lip Brush \"The only lip brush I use is the Chanel Angled Lip Brush #33 . I have so many of them. The angle makes it easy to define lips and fits on every curve.\" —Nick Barose, who has worked with Lupita Nyong'o, Brit Marling, and Zoe Kravitz $32 ( nordstrom.com ). Best Brush for Cut Creases \"This little beauty, the Smashbox Definer Brush #15 , is my secret weapon for giving makeup that professionally applied finish. It's for blending or even working the cut crease trend. Also, you can use it to highlight the center of the eyelid.\" —Georgina Graham, who has worked with Alexa Chung, Chloe Moretz, and Jennifer Lopez Courtesy of brand Best Brush for Liquid Foundation \"I love the aesthetic of the YSL Y-Brush and how easy it makes my job when doing base. I load liquid foundation directly on the bristles and apply it onto the skin in a circular motion. I can also apply foundation with my fingertips then buff it in with the brush. I also use it to prep the skin when with face lotion — just as I would with liquid foundation.\" —Min Min Ma, Honey Artists Courtesy of brand Best Brush for Highlighter \"The Sigma Beauty F03 High Cheekbone Highlighter Brush is great for your highlighter, but I almost always use it for contouring the hollows of the cheek and around the perimeter of the face. The bristles are both fluffy but firm, making it ideal to deposit color and blend.\" —Carissa Ferreri, who has worked with Gina Rodriguez, Annette Benning, and Alexis Ren $20 ( sigmabeauty.com ). Best Blending Brush \"This dome-shaped Gucci Blending Brush #20 is very versatile, so I have a few around. It's perfect to blend over smoky eyes and looks seamless. I use a clean one to slightly contour the nose and jawline. It won't makeup look too defined, streaky, or fake.\" –Barose Courtesy of brand Best Mascara Brush \"My favorite for getting mascara on those oft-challenging bottom lashes without clumps is the Sephora Collection Pro Lash Fan #34 . The bent barrel makes getting at them a snap. I also love to use it clean without any product to separate top lashes in between layers of mascara.\" —Suzy Gerstein, Honey Artists $15 ( sephora.com ). Best Contouring Brush “The Surratt Artistique Highlight Brush is like the Tesla of makeup brushes. It's so sleek and perfectly thought out. The balance of the handle and the brush head is perfect. The hairs are incredibly soft, allowing the most even and lovely application of product. I use this for blush, highlighter and contour. It's just so pleasurable.” —Stiles $115 ( sephora.com ). Best Cream Eyeliner Brush “The Anastasia Beverly Hills Duo Brush #7B has an angle for filling in brows, but I also like this type of brush for liner, too. It also has a spoolie brush to comb through brows.” —Graham Courtesy of brand Best Blending Brush for Hooded Eyelids \"Anyone who knows me — professionally or personally — knows that I love a smoky eye look. When I do one, especially when using powder eyeshadows, I want to blend and blend some more for seamless edges. This brush does just that, and because the tip of the brush is small, I can get really precise, especially when working with hooded eyelids.\" —Ma $25.50 ( lancome-usa.com ). Best Brush for Natural-Looking Brows “When I need to do a natural-looking full brow, the Hakuhodo J5549HBkSL Eyebrow Brush Angled never fails me. It has a wide shape I've never seen before, but it's perfect for doing 'boy brows'.\" –Romy Soleimani, who did the makeup for our April 2017 cover $22 ( hakuhodo.com ). Best Concealer Brush “The Marc Jacobs Beauty The Conceal Full Cover Correcting Brush pats and blends concealer right into skin and hard-to-reach inner corners of the eyes with its fluffy tips. It’s like if a flat concealer brush and a dense eye shadow blending brush had a baby. You can also use it for applying concealer, primer or color corrector to lids before shadow.” —New York City-based makeup artist, Susie Sobol $30 ( marcjacobsbeauty.com ). Best Blush Brush “The Nars Yachiyo Kabuki Brush can be used for powder, bronzer or blush and is a great all-round face brush. It's big enough for all-over powdering but small enough for creating a healthy glow with blush. —Graham $55 ( narscosmetics.com ). Best Powder Foundation Brush “I have literally gotten rid of all of my previous foundation brushes and only use the Crème Shop The OMG Brush Foundation Powder to apply and blend powder foundation seamlessly into skin. Every model and celebrity I work with comments on how good it feels on their face. It is the holy grail of any liquid or cream product application.” —Sobol Best Eye Shadow Blending Brush “The Bobbi Brown Eye Contour Brush is great for applying eye shadow in the socket line of the eye. The shape of the brush makes it especially good for blending easily and evenly.” —Rowe $37 ( bobbibrowncosmetics.com ). Best Under-Eye Concealer Brush \"The Laura Mercier Camouflage Powder Brush might be for powder, but I use it for cream. The size is just like my finger — except you should never use your finger to apply concealer under your eyes. It gets floppy and cakey.” —Barose $28 ( lauramercier.com ). Best Brush for Setting Powder “I love the Real Techniques Setting Brush for setting makeup with loose powder, especially for smaller areas of the face like the middle of the forehead, under the eyes, around the nose, and on the chin. I actually never use a big powder brush since it takes shine away from where I like to keep it.” —Sobol $7.99 ( ulta.com ). Best Eye Shadow Shading Brush “I often use my fingers when applying eyeshadow, However I do love the M.A.C. 239 Eye Shader Brush for detail work. It's flat and round, so I can use this to press shadow directly on the lid or I can use the tip to softly line along the lash line.\" —Soleimani # Keywords # Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:38:19.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
