Pic: Tim Hunter. PRODRIVE’S dream team has been reunited for 2017. \nChaz Mostert and Adam de Borre will be paired up again on the No. 55 Ford for the 2017 season as the race engineer returns to Prodrive Racing Australia. \nThe pair’s reunion comes amid a wholesale switch of race engineers across the squad’s four cars, which sees Mark Winterbottom joined by Brad Hogan, Cameron Waters by Brad Wischusen, and returnee Jason Bright with Sam Potter. \nMostert and De Borre were a formidable combination in 2015. \nThey had been together since Mostert’s arrival in the Supercars Championship midway through 2013, but the arrival of the FG X Falcon saw Mostert emerge as a title threat. \nThere were weekends that year where the No. 6 Ford was untouchable. Mostert and De Borre celebrate after a win and a podium at Winton in 2015. Pic: Jake Nowakowski \nMostert romped to five race wins and an Armor All Pole Award-winning 10 pole positions, fighting for the title until his horror Bathurst qualifying crash that brought his season — and their partnership — to an early end. \nDe Borre left Prodrive at the end of that season for family reasons, joining DJR Team Penske for 2016 in a role that allowed him to work remotely from the Queensland team’s base. \nNow he returns to the Melbourne team with the hope that it will rekindle their past success and end a winless streak for Mostert that dates back to August 2015. \n“It’s really exciting to be teaming up with Adam again. He has been my engineer for most of my big career moments so to continue this journey with him is awesome,” Mostert said. \n“Brad (Wischusen) was awesome to work with last year and we developed a really good relationship but having worked with Adam for so many years, it’ll be easy to pick up where we left off. \n“I really want to win races this year, that’s my goal, and I hope that we can be quick from the get go.” Winterbottom with Jason Gray at SMSP last year. Pic: Tim Hunter. \nThe engineering change on Winterbottom’s car marks the fifth in the past six seasons, the new partnership with Hogan stemming from the departure of Jason Gray, who engineered Frosty to his 2015 title and throughout the 2016 season. \n“I have a lot of respect for Brendan,” Winterbottom said. \n“He’s worked with a lot of good drivers and certainly knows what he’s doing when it comes to these cars and the category as a whole. \n“I definitely think he can help us get back up there and back to a bit of consistency because that’s one thing that wasn’t as strong last year.” \nWith Dilan Talabani departing Prodrive for Nissan Motorsport, Potter steps up from engineering Jack Le Brocq in last year’s Super2 Series to oversee Bright’s Mega-sponsored car, although he will work closely with the team’s chief engineer Nathaniel Osborne to help smooth the veteran’s transition to the FG X Falcon early in the season. \n“We had some big changes to make at the end of last year but it gave us an opportunity put our best foot forward for this year,” Prodrive team principal Tim Edwards said. \n“We chose to put Jason with Sam this year because we all know that he, as a driver, is one of the best engineering minds in the field so in Sam’s first year they’ll be able to bounce off each other and try different ideas. \n“I’m confident in the ability of each of our engineers and I think with this structure we’ll be up there again this year. Brad and Brendan are well and truly integrated with the team now and with a decent amount of time under their belts respectively, so they know what they’ve got to work with and what we can do to improve. \n“It’s great to have Adam back. We are confident with his relationship with the team and Chaz of course so the transition back to the team will be easy and we’ll hit the ground running there.” Like this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:37:47.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
