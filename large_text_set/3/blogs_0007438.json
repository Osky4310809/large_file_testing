There's no shame losing to Bayern but there is when you down tools for the last half an hour and you lose 10-2. Shameful. \n\"Overplaying it from the back. I bet you Bayern couldn't believe their luck. I thought they were shameful the last half an hour. \n\"The goals they were giving away and people not running back. Yes they played really well in the first half but gave up in the second half. At this level, at any level, it's ridiculous.
