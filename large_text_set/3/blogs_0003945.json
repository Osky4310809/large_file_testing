West Coast could have to travel an extra game under a possible 17-5 fixture. Picture: Mark Dadswell   \nBut dealing with the bottom six is viewed by clubs as the major problem that would need resolution. It has been suggested that 13-18 teams would play for draft picks — with the 13th team winning first pick — but there are concerns from clubs how this would play out, given that the 13th team could be significantly better than the bottom three to four sides. \nNisbett, who last year spoke positively about how the 17-5 concept would make a fairer fixture, appears to have taken a different view in 2017, though he was talking to Fox Sports from a club perspective. \nFremantle, meanwhile, said it was “still waiting to understand” how the 17-5 system worked, but club chief executive Steve Rosich said there were “complicating factors” for a team in Perth that should be “taken into account for this new initiative”. \nRosich said a Perth team needed a guarantee of 11 home games. Other clubs have largely assumed that each club would have 11 home games. \nThe perceived major positives of the 17-5 system is that the shape of the ladder is determined by a more equitable draw and that there would be fewer “dead” games late in the season. \nBut clubs also have questions about the commercial impact of the short notice, given they have relied on certainty in their arrangements with sponsors, members and stadiums.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T10:47:37.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
