Los Angeles and San Francisco both then proposed sites, but ultimately, the director chose Los Angeles.\nThe George Lucas Museum of Narrative Arts will be located right next to Lucas’ alma mater, the University of Southern California, in Exposition Park. Lucas himself will fund the museum out of pocket and fill it with his own personal art collection, which includes famous paintings, film artifacts, and a whole lot of one-of-a-kind Star Wars stuff.\nAdvertisement \n\nAccording to a statement, Lucas is said to have chosen Los Angeles because the museum will “have the greatest impact on the broader community, fulfilling our goal of inspiring, engaging and educating a broad and diverse visitorship.”\nHere are a few artist renderings of what the museum will look like once it’s completed.\n\n\nThere’s more information at the below link.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:57:55.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
