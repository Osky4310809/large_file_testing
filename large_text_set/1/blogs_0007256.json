Us, too! The Golden Globes is, of course, always the best because there is drinking allowed, so who better to host than your mans Jimmy Fallon? Let’s see what everyone’s wearing in our annual, constantly updating red carpet showdown! Advertisement \nAbove, Anna Chlumsky and Tracee Ellis Ross —two of our perennial faves—have what appears to be a ring-off. Tracee wins (and Anna knows it). \nKarreuche Tran in hot pink mermaid; Ron Cephas Jones (of Mr. Robot and father to Hamilton ’s Jasmine ) in a nice tie clip; Jocelyn Towne in pretty florals and Simon Helberg in contrasting velvet; Yvette Nicole Brown went with pretty sequins. \nAnna Chlumsky ’s kelly green bias-cut is Grecian and lovely, though we need more angles for the fit; Questlove ’s signature accessory, the red Dee & Ricky lego heart, shines for every occasion; The People vs. OJ Simpson ’s Sterling K. Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathe are flossing what appears to be an early trend—shiny, sparkly, pretty as can be. Meanwhile, the Beetlejuice gown on Atlanta ’s Zazie Beetz is fantastic and unlike we’ll probably see much tonight. Very ‘90s chic, but also extremely runway Winona. \nTwo of the best actors in Hollywood and power couple Courtney B. Vance and Angela Bassett look like they mean business, as usual; I particularly like the tulip effect on Bassett’s shoulders, and the tulip-y hue. Emily Ratajowski is typically vampy in diamond-encrusted, butter satin, and your girl Lola Kirke is very soft and romantic in violets. Tracee Ellis Ross , style maven, is typically great in Zuhar Murad; let’s also shout out her hairstylist for easing an intense dress with a pretty, playful pony.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T01:37:42.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
