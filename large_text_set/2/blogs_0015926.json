Gal Gadot has come to rely upon those fans and their never-ending support since she brought Diana to life in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice . Just last year, the actress introduced the world to her formidable take on the heroine, and Gadot will reprise the role in a solo Wonder Woman film this summer. Now, in an interview with Empire Magazine , the star is talking about how she first nabbed the role. \nAnd, unsurprisingly, the whole story is rather heartwarming one. \nSpeaking candidly about her audition for Wonder Woman, Gadot recalled that she was asked to meet with Zack Snyder after losing out on a role in Man of Steel . The meeting wound up being a camera test, and Gadot left the impromptu audition a bit confused. \nSpeaking to her agent, Gadot “said, ‘Great, but who’s the character?’ My agent said, ‘Oh, you don’t know? I don’t know either.’” \nHowever, the director did not leave Gadot in the dark for too long. “Zack called me about two days before I was to travel from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles. Super-nonchalantly, he said, ‘By the way, do you know who you’re testing for? I don’t know if you have her in Israel, but do you know Wonder Woman?’ Then I literally passed out, came back to life, tried to put on my coolest voice and was like, ‘Yeah, I know of her.’” Gadot explained. \nThe actress even joked that the DC Extended Universe folks continued to audition her for Wonder Woman even as she filmed Batman v Superman . When asked if she knew a standalone film had been in the works since day one, Gadot answered, “I think they were still auditioning me while I was doing the movie.” \nAre you excited for Wonder Woman? If so, let us know by giving the film a rating with our Anticipation Rankings below! Currently, the movie is #6 on all of ComicBook! \nBefore she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, when an American pilot crashes on their shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat. Fighting alongside man in a war to end all wars, Diana will discover her full powers…and her true destiny. \nWonder Woman stars Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston, Elena Anaya, Ewen Bremner and Saïd Taghmaoui. Patty Jenkins directs the film from a screenplay by Allan Heinberg and Geoff Johns, story by Zack Snyder and Allan Heinberg, based on characters from DC Entertainment. Wonder Woman was created by William Moulton Marston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:53:46.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
