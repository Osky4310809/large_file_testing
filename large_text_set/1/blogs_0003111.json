The fans were prepared for Steve to walk away from the show if the new regime didn’t agree to the relaxed taping schedule he’s grown accustomed too. \nAs part of Burton’s previous contract with the Young and the Restless , Burton was given generous time off and taped his scenes in just a few days instead of reporting to the CBS Studio four days a week. This allowed him to spend more time with his family in Tennessee, spending less time traveling to Los Angeles. It looks like the new regime at the Young and the Restless may not have offered Steve such a relaxed taping schedule, which could have been a factor in Burton’s decision to walk away from the show. ‘It’s Not Over Yet’ \nApparently, many viewers thought that Monday’s episode would be the end of the storyline and we’d soon discover that Dylan was killed in the line duty or turn up missing after failing to check in the with Kevin(Greg Rikaart) as Christine (Lauralee Bell) instructed.
