With the socioeconomic gap in outcomes emerging early, providing support to parents at this point could reap dividends for social mobility later on in life.” \nThe Conservative party’s 2010 manifesto included a key pledge to increase the number of health visitors. NHS Digital figures show the number of full-time or equivalent health visitors in England fell by almost 1,000 between October 2015 and August 2016. \nIn December a survey of health visitors by the Institute of Health Visiting found that 85% of respondents felt their workload had increased in the last two years. Some were having to look after between 500 and 1,000 children, when the maximum recommended is 250. \nLabour said the commission’s figures showed the government was failing to invest in early years support. Emma Lewell-Buck, the shadow minister for children and families, said: “Becoming a parent for the first time is an exciting but scary time and it is shocking that not all parents are getting the support they need. \n“The Tories promised more health visitors by taking away money from Sure Start Centres. Six years later we have lost over 700 centres and we are still waiting for the health visitors. The Tories have completely failed to invest these crucial early years.” \nA spokesperson for Public Health England said: “Ensuring every child has the best start in life is one of our key priorities. We are supporting local authorities in commissioning services that support families and provide early help when needed. \n“We are also working with councils to give health visitors professional guidance and leadership, as well as evidence of what works, to help them meet their public health responsibilities.” \nThe commission also said parents were finding it more difficult to access local children’s centre services, citing a 2015 survey which found more than 60% of children’s centre managers said they were cutting back on services to meet their budgets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T00:26:16.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
