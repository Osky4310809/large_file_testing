Advertisement \nSpeaking to Digital Spy , Ridley Scott explained why he’s turned down superhero movies: \nSuperhero movies are not my kind of thing—that’s why I’ve never really done one. [I’ve been asked] several times, but I can’t believe in the thin, gossamer tight-rope of the non-reality of the situation of the superhero. \nI’ve done that kind of movie— Blade Runner really is a comic strip when you think about it, it’s a dark story told in an unreal world. You could almost put Batman or Superman in that world, that atmosphere, except I’d have a fucking good story, as opposed to no story! \nYou can’t really blame him for knowing that superhero movies aren’t really his thing, but you can sort of call into question the idea that Ridley Scott’s problem is how much suspension of disbelief is required to watch them. At least he acknowledged that Blade Runner is in a similar situation ( and he took what has to be a shot at Batman v. Superman while he was at it). Advertisement \nAlthough, Scott does then go on to say that it’s not just superhero movies that aren’t his thing right now. Movies generally, he says, are “mainly pretty bad.” Which, okay, I wouldn’t necessarily agree there. Although, if he’s just talking about the ones that have made the most money, I could almost see where he’s coming from. \nAll that aside, the thing I’m left with is imagining which superhero movies he was asked to do and what they would have looked like. I think the funniest pairing in my head is Scott and Guardians of the Galaxy , but I’m open to suggestions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T17:24:01.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
