The Vikings traded up into the first round to take a player who only has value as a KR which is a position being legislated out of the league. Classic purples!! #Bust SKOLOLOL!!!

Mar 7, 2017 11:07 AM \nBuilding around Glennon… Three words that make you throw up in your mouth. Mar 7, 2017 11:09 AM \nwhere was the commitment to build around Cutler? filthymcnasty3 says: Mar 7, 2017 11:10 AM \nHe will do whatever he can to get out of MN, especially now that the hometown newspaper has forever labeled it “Loserville, USA”. tjacks7 says: Mar 7, 2017 11:13 AM \nPatterson was railroaded by Norv and disappeared for two years as Zimmer had no desire to be involved in the offense. Granted, he may have slacked off for a bit after his rookie year, but he’s far to valuable to ride the pines like Norv had him do. Patterson is tailor made for Shurmur, hence his reemergence. If he goes to a coach with a clue on offense he’ll be the steal of free agency. Mar 7, 2017 11:16 AM \nPlease, please replace Alshon Jeffery with Cordarelle Patterson… \nBears… Vikings fan here… Do it…. I double dare you… wademaxwell1990 says: Mar 7, 2017 11:18 AM \nStay away from him. The Bears need to stay at the bottom of the division right where they belong! Vikings need to resign him if they are letting Peterson walk Mar 7, 2017 11:27 AM \nmialto says: Mar 7, 2017 11:04 AM \nBears have White, Jeffery, Wilson, Meredith, Bellamy, Thompson, Miller, Royal…when healthy. \nHow about focusing on the Defense Secondary which has been god awful???!!! \n- Jeffery is pretty well gone, and Wilson and Thompson are FA. Royal is going to be released, and Miller hasn’t finished a season in 6 years. If they are signing him to be more than a KR and 4th or 5th WR, I will be concerned, but if it is for that role, it makes a lot of sense. They need bodies right now, because the only receivers under contract are Bellamy, White, Braverman, and Royal (to be released). That does not inspire confidence as a group.
