This cannot stand!\nTomi Lahren , the 24-year-old who's made a name for herself as a conservative rabble-rouser, could possibly be in trouble with her employer after proclaiming herself as pro-choice on The View Friday.\nRelated: Trump Refuses To Retract Wiretapping Claims \nDuring her appearance on the talk show, Tomi said:\n\"I can't sit here and be a hypocrite and say I'm for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies.\"\nA pro-choice Republican, guys! It's like pigs sprouting wings!\nGlenn Beck , the founder of conservative media outlet The Blaze where Tomi is employed as a host, is reportedly not happy with her comments about abortion, and according to The Daily Caller , this might lead to her being ousted from the network in September, when her contract is set to expire.\nOn his radio show Monday, Glenn said addressed Tomi's stance, saying: \n\"I would disagree that you're a hypocrite if you want limited government, and yet you want the government to protect life of the unborn.\"\nBut he didn't seem to think it warranted firing, as he also said:\n\"First of all, we have a whole bunch of different kinds of people that work here. We started The Blaze with a show called the real news, real news was absolutely fantastic. And it was hosted by Amy Holmes who was openly pro-choice. So if you're pro-choice, you can have a job at the blaze.\n\"I don't hire people who are sycophants or who have my opinion. I try to hire people who have a different opinion because I believe in being intellectually rigorous. I don't want straw men. I want people to make a real argument on the other side so we can learn from each other and we can grow.\"\nHmm, seems like her job is safe!\nMeanwhile, Tomi spent most of the weekend defending herself.\nI have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker.\n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017 \nI have my beliefs and you have yours. Doesn't make you right. Never said y'all have to agree with me. Get over it. https://t.co/wResXuUNet \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 19, 2017 \nNah, actually I said I believe it would make me a hypocrite. I never claimed to speak for you or judge you. You do you. https://t.co/B4mfjdHUt4 \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 19, 2017 \nIt's okay, Tomi.
