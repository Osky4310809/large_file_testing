Trump responded, “Look, I don’t like tweeting, I have other things I could be doing. But I get very dishonest media, very dishonest press.” \nAnd so, the president-elect said, “It’s my only way that I can counteract.” \nAfter the clip played, Newt Gingrich defended Trump on this and said that he may have “made mistakes,” but what he’s doing is “out in the open.” \nWatch above, via Fox News. The full interview airs on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:38:11.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
