This week it has looked as if North Korea might be the first hot spot. A series of ballistic missile tests and other provocative actions by North Korea, a nuclear-capable country, have heightened regional anxieties and stirred speculation about America’s reaction. The most recent tests involved the simultaneous launch on Monday of four missiles, which landed off Japan’s coast. The North Koreans have described the tests as drills for striking American bases in Japan, but the ultimate goal is assumed to be a strike on the United States. Some experts expect Pyongyang to have that capability within four years. This use of multiple missiles raised concerns that the North was trying out a new attack strategy that could overwhelm Japan’s limited defenses, analysts said. The tests almost certainly were a reaction to annual United States-South Korea military exercises , which began last week and which the North considers a threat. It is just three weeks since the North crossed another milestone by launching a solid-rocket missile, which is more efficient than the liquid-fueled missiles it had previously relied on; there were also tests in August and September. North Korea now possesses the fissile material for perhaps 21 nuclear weapons and is steadily improving its ability to deliver them with missiles. The country also has chemical weapons, which may have been used when the half brother of North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un , was assassinated in Malaysia last month. Malaysia has accused several North Korean citizens of using VX nerve agent to kill him, which seems plausible and underscores the lengths to which Mr. Kim is willing to go to eliminate perceived rivals.
