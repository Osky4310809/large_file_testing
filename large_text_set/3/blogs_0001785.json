But most Americans are growing weary of the unending culture of outrage, according to a new Fox News poll. Among men and women alike, the overall majority's message? It's time to get over it, guys: A 53% majority thinks it’s time to \"move on\" from protesting Trump @FoxNews #Poll DETAILS: https://t.co/7HOMXws9Hk pic.twitter.com/qdtzaqleoL — Fox News Poll (@foxnewspoll) March 2, 2017 The poll asks, “What message would you like to send to people who are protesting President Trump and his policies?” Over half, 53 percent, would tell them “it’s time to move on,” while 44 percent would implore them “don’t give up the fight” ...

I'll leave you with the latest disgraceful scene from the Resistance's front lines. Controversial conservative author and scholar Charles Murray was invited to speak at Middlebury College this week, where a mob of students disrupted and shut down his event -- shouting down and injuring a female professor in the ensuing melee.
