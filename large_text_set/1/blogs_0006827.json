No impact on blockchain \nNotably, such instructions do not appear to have been given to startups working on blockchain projects or implementations using the distributed ledger technology behind bitcoin or alternative cryptographic tokens. \nDJ Qian, CEO of blockchain-as-a-service startup BitSE, for example, indicated that the news \"does not affect its business\" due to its focus on non-monetary applications, a statement that was echoed in other responses. \nTong Li, CEO of Circle China, the bitcoin and blockchain-based messaging service, noted that he is not concerned about the directives or its impact on Circle's operations. \nHowever, he did suggest that the announcement would be worth \"following closely\". \nBlockchain investor Bo Shen, founding partner of Fenbushi Capital, expressed similar sentiment, indicating that he had not been in contact with any central bank officials about the topics discussed with bitcoin exchanges. \nShen is one of the more prolific investors in China-based blockchain projects, backing firms including Juzhen Financials as well as a number of open-source, alternative blockchain projects. \nAdding potential insight is that Shen did offer a few words of advice to local exchanges, adding: \n\"Two things I would like to remind those exchanges: high volatility is not good and strict accordance with KYC and AML.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:15:02.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
