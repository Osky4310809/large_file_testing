I refuse to stand by & let this misguided, lawless resolution undermine our nation's laws and endanger our families. https://t.co/9aZQOukiyx \n— Pete Sessions (@PeteSessions) February 8, 2017 \nOther Dallas County officials were confident that the resolution carried no legal weight, and ensured that the county was compliant with ICE requests, according to Newsmax . \nWhile the Texas state government threatens to “bring down the hammer” on any county or community that refuses to enforce immigration law or cooperate with federal immigration officials, President Trump has similarly threatened to the same at the federal level. \nImmigration laws exist for good reasons — to protect our national security and ensure that harmful people, weapons and drugs aren’t flooded into our communities. Political figures who refuse to enforce those laws don’t have their citizens’ best interests at heart. \nFortunately, we have leaders like Gov. Abbott who aren’t afraid to stand up for what is right and use their authority to protect the country in every way possible. \nLike and share this article on Facebook and Twitter if you’re glad to see Gov.
