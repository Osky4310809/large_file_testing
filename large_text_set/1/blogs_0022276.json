We take for granted that the characters on The Big Bang Theory are our fellow nerds , ’cause they mostly are, but we’re here to expose Dr. Leonard Hofstadter for the FRAUD that he is. As any person who truly wears glasses knows, it’s a burden to bear , even if they’re SUPER CUTE and in line with your #aesthetic, keeping glasses clean is a lifelong chore.\nBut not for Leonard — because his glasses aren’t real and don’t have lenses, ya’ll. Yeah, as glasses wearers, we feel betrayed, too. Look deeeep into his eyes — and you’ll realize that it’s actually quite easy to do because his glasses have no lenses and you can see straight through.\nGalecki told the Huffington Post , “We rehearsed the first episode for about a week and a half, and when we started to shoot, they said, ‘Well, you’re gonna take your glasses off, right?’ I said, ‘No, I want Leonard to wear glasses.’ They said, ‘Oh, we just thought you were wearing them as Johnny for rehearsal all week.” \nHe also said that they had to get rid of the lenses in his glasses for shooting purposes — when he looked up with his regular glasses, the lights caught the lenses and created a glare. WE GET IT, IT’S PRACTICAL.\n“I quickly popped out the lenses and that’s the movie magic behind that,” Galecki stated.\nAnd obviously Galecki has run into problems on set. It must be weird to wear glasses with no lenses and act like nothing is wrong. In fact, the actor told HuffPo that he’s accidentally poked through the frame and ended up scratching his eye (which, ouch). “That kind of killed the moment,” said Galecki. We bet!\n\nBut we can’t help but feel a l tle betrayed by one of our favorite nerds. We still love you, Leonard, but we’d love you better with real glasses. JUST sayin’.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:15:56.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
