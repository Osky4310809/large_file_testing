(Photo by Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Jason Colton has been on the Redskins season ticket waiting list since the 1990s. In 2001, he was told he was about 40,000th on the list. Eventually, the team started offering him tickets every offseason, which he declined, mostly because of FedEx Field’s location and the cost of tickets, transportation and food.\nThere are hundreds or thousands of people like him in this area. It’s not a big deal. The world has changed in the last 15 years. Still, Colton was more than a little surprised when he picked up the phone on Thursday and found a Redskins ticket rep on the other end of the phone. Thursday, for obvious reasons, seemed like a less-than-ideal time to try to sell fans on the Redskins product.\n“I told the guy, ‘Are you kidding me? Today you call?’ ” said Colton, who like just about every other Washington fan has gawked in amazement as the team deconstructed itself in recent days. Then he thought of a better message.\n[ ‘I feel betrayed': Redskins fans erupt in fury after latest reports of front office dysfunction ]\n“Tell you what: you get all your [stuff] together, fire Bruce Allen, sign the quarterback, and maybe I’ll think about it,’ ” Colton remembered saying.\n“So I can call you at a later time?” the Redskins salesman replied.\n“I couldn’t believe he said that,” Colton told me. “I was like, ‘Wow, you’re a true salesman. Fire Bruce Allen and we’ll see.’ ”\nColton wasn’t the only fan having some fun with the front office Thursday. Another fan, who asked not to be named, forwarded me an email exchange he had with a team sales rep. This fan — let’s call him Kurt — bought season tickets in 2012, and had a blast during that NFC East-winning campaign. Then things went bad. By midway through the 2014 season, he couldn’t find any family members or friends to go to games with him. The last game he went to was the disaster against Tampa Bay. And the final straw came a few weeks later, when he sold his tickets for the Rams game (which cost a total of $186 per game) for $6.74 on the secondary market.\n“I was basically losing $1,500 per year on tickets and you can’t justify that for arguably the worst organization in sports,” he wrote.\nSo anyhow, last month, a team rep emailed him, with the subject line “We want you back!” Here’s how the message began:\nWe saw you were a prior season ticket holder here and wanted to see if this year was the year to have you or any family or friends back here at FedEx Field with the team. I know the season ended on a sour note, but we want people like you to help keep the Redskins a winning team by joining the family for the ten biggest parties of the year including Oakland, Denver, and Arizona!\n“Kurt” never responded, but today he finally was moved to write back. “Hi,” he wrote. “I am interested. Thanks.”\n[ That time Allen said McCloughan would be in charge of the roster ]\nThe salesman responded three minutes later:\nSounds great! I saw you used to sit in Section 423; is the upper bowl something you still wanted or did you want to take a look at lower bowl seating?\nAnd then “Kurt” wrote this back:\nIn reality, I have never been interested LESS in purchasing Redskins season tickets in my lifetime. Your organization, beginning with your owner, is an absolute abomination. In the 25 years I have followed the Redskins since the age of five, there have been exactly two, TWO SEASONS, where it seemed the organization was competent. It turns out that was all a ruse and nothing had changed at all. I feel completely despondent, betrayed and gutted. Come talk to me if Bruce Allen is fired and Scot McCloughan is given a 10-year contract to be in control of all football decisions. Otherwise, please do not have anyone from the Washington Redskins contact me ever again.\nI suspect your organization is receiving a lot of emails of this nature right now. It would be in the best interest of your organization for your owner to know this is how the fans feel.\nNow look, we can all agree that the poor soul on the other end of that email is not to blame here, and probably does not deserve such scorn just for doing his job. But Redskins fans are having a moment. Let “Kurt” explain.\n“I view myself as an investor in the Redskins (financially and emotionally) who has gotten zero return on his investment,” he wrote to me. “I realize there is a 0.1 percent chance that email ever finds its way to Dan Snyder, but if there is even a chance he can see something that will allow him to fully understand how he has ruined the Washington Redskins, it is worth it.”\nAs for the phone salesman who tried to sell our friend Jason on season tickets?\n“I’m sure he’s not getting a lot of receptive people,” Colton said. “That guy just picked a bad day to come to work.”\nMeanwhile, in other news… (And to all you people: whether you’re telling the truth about giving up on the team, you aren’t allowed to stop reading about them. Think of the bloggers.)\n@BurgundyBlog @dcsportsbog My grandparents held season tickets for 40 years. I've been a fan and defender my whole life (I'm 44).
