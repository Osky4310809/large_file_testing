Roar v Western Sydney Wanderers wrap: Aloisi’s super subs, ‘something isn’t right’ with WSW Michael Puterflam, FOX SPORTS  14am \nIT’S an all too familiar story for two reasons. \nOnce again Brisbane Roar emerged victorious with a last-gasp goal while the Wanderers were left with nothing. \nSubstitute Brett Holman could not have made a better return after two months out with Roar’s 93rd minute winner, but Vedran Janjetovic will be cursing himself for not pushing the shot over the bar. \nThe loss will be even more painful for the Western Sydney goalkeeper as he made vital saves to keep his side in the match. \nBut in a game where both teams underperformed, the ultimate difference was made by the substitutes. \nWhile Brendon Santalab and Nico Martinez both made impacts with dangerous link-up play after Tony Popovic brought them on, it was John Aloisi’s decision to hold off making his first substitute until the 75th minute that eventually won his team all three points. media_camera Roar player Brandon Borrello (left) celebrates with Roar player Brett Holman (right). \nTommy Oar forced a superb save from Janjetovic, Manuel Arana drew a second yellow card from Scott Neville, and then Holman fired home the late winner just like Jamie Maclaren had done off the bench against Wellington the week before. \n“They [the Wanderers] made their subs before ours and got on top,” Aloisi told Fox Sports. \n“I saw bringing on Tommy Oar was going to make an impact.” \nHolman conceded he was “lucky the keeper made a mistake” while Fox Sports football expert Mark Bosnich felt sorry for Janjetovic and said the goal was “fortuitous”. \nBut while Western Sydney have been unlucky to lose matches this season, this was not one of those occasions as the opposition was simply better. \n“Tonight was a little bit different. Brisbane was the better performance-wise. Their subs made a difference,” said former Sydney FC captain Mark Rudan. \nHe added: “In the end they (the Wanderers) think they should have got a point but it’s not easy.” media_camera Wanderers goal keeper Vedran Janjetovic. \n“Overall we definitely deserve something but we go home empty-handed,” Wanderers coach Popovic told Fox Sports. \n“I thought we more than held our own. But that’s how it is for us this year.” \nBut according to Bosnich, the Wanderers were simply too “pedestrian” and simply weren’t good enough. \n“Some of the players were too pedestrian,” said Bonsich. \n“They’re playing well in patches but they aren’t winning games. Three wins at this point in the season isn’t good enough. \n“Something isn’t quite right.” Roar steal win from Wanderers 2:31 \nA-League: The Brisbane Roar have stolen one from the Wanderers, as Brett Holman fired a goal in the 93rd minute to give the Roar the win.

Cornthwaite is back in but we don’t know where Pinatares is. \n“They have a lot of work if they want to get into that top four. I think top six is more realistic.” \nHowever even a top six finish isn’t a guarantee. \n“If Central Coast Mariners and Wanderers play like they did today then they’ll be hard pressed \nfor them [the Wanderers] to win,” said Bosnich. \n“The table doesn’t lie. They’ve only won three times this season. That’s the same as the Mariners. \n“Not to make the top six would be a disaster for the Western Sydney Wanderers.” \nBut that’s how the Wanderers are tracking this season. media_camera Jumpei Kusukami of the Wanderers. \nBOZZA: BOTH TEAMS SHOULD HAVE HAD A PENALTY \nBrendon Santalab came close to once again being the matchwinner. \nMidway through the second half, the Wanderers striker appeared to be tugged from behind by a Roar defender when a ball was played across the face of goal. \nThe referee didn’t award a penalty, but Bosnich believes he should have. media_camera Santalab is brought to ground. \nHowever, Roar also should have been awarded one for a Scott Neville handball later in the match. \nA Wanderers defender cleared a corner onto Neville’s hand and, even though he was moving to tuck it into his body, Bosnich thought it was also a penalty. \nNeville eventually saw red for his challenge or Arana, but Santalab had two golden chances to win the match for Western Sydney. \nFirst Michael Theo expertly came out to save his shot and then the striker’s header from the subsequent corner bounced off the crossbar twice. media_camera Scott Neville. \nBAD DEFENDING FOR BOTH OF THE FIRST GOALS \nBut both managers may be upset with their teams’ defending to concede the opening goals of the match. \nWhile Jack Clisby’s clearance from Daniel Bowles’ cross went straight to a Roar player before Brandon Borrello buried his shot, Roar were at fault for Jumpei Kusukami’s equaliser. \n“They [Roar] just backed off Kusukami,” said Fox Sports commentator Mike Cockerill. media_camera Borrello (right) shoots and scores. \n“They gave him the time gave him the space and he made them pay.” \nIt was a great finish but Brisbane will be disappointed as they’ve dominated play and possession. \nHowever Rudan said for Roar’s opener, Clisby “should have done much better at this level”.
