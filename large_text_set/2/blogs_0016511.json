It’s not something you have ever heard a President of the United States say. Not even Nixon went there, and it is deeply concerning. I hope it is repudiated by people from both parties.” \nSenator John McCain reacted yesterday to Trump’s tweet by also invoking “dictators” clamping down on the press . \nWatch above, via ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T16:08:32.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
