It also requested the National Bureau of Investigation to locate the witnesses identified in Abad’s report. \nAbad said the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency submitted an affidavit by a certain Paul Black dated Oct. 26, 2007 that he paid P50,000 in exchange for the dismissal of a case filed against his wife. \nPDEA also submitted documents showing that Reyes dismissed the case against a certain Norma Domingo, who supposedly negotiated payoffs on behalf of the judge with those charged with similar offenses.   \nAn affidavit by Melchora Nagen said she was acquitted after paying P50,000. \nAbad also cited anonymous letters from certain lawyers saying their clients obtained similar acquittals. \nReyes had denied the allegations, saying the acquittals were based solely on evidence.
