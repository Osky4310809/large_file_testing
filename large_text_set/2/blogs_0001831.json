As a result, we have received an extremely limited number of tickets for this fixture, a total of approximately 750, which is majority standing and a very limited number of seating tickets. We believe this is the lowest allocation of tickets we have received for a fixture in the modern era of arranged ticket allocations. \nThis is a very challenging situation for us all and we appreciate that many of our loyal supporters will be disappointed at not getting a ticket for this match. \nA random ballot will be held to determine which Away Ticket Scheme members will receive a ticket to this match. There are currently in excess of 1,100 members of the Away Ticket Scheme, which means that many fans will unfortunately not get a ticket. \nHowever, as explained in   of the Away Ticket Scheme ( click here to view it ), we cannot guarantee to provide a ticket to members for each match covered by the scheme. Therefore, a ballot will be held to determine which Away Ticket Scheme members will be allocated a ticket. \nThe ballot will be strictly random and run by an independent third party utilising software used for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. All Away Ticket Scheme members will be advised by email if they have been successful or unsuccessful in obtaining a ticket no later than 10am on Thursday, February 9 . Ticket prices are: standing £30 (£20 OAPs and students; £15 for under-16s); seating £35 (£25 OAPs and students; £20 for under-16s). \nWe apologise in advance to any supporters who are unsuccessful or have not been able to apply for a ticket to the match. We appreciate there will sadly be many loyal fans who will not get tickets for this match, but also urge fans to understand our situation in not being able to satisfy the demand. \nWe thank you all for your understanding in this matter.
