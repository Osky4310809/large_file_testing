The partners will again work together to bring live streamed programming from award shows exclusively to Twitter, including red carpet pre-shows for the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards, 2017 Billboard Music Awards and 2017 American Music Awards. \nThe partnership is now one of several Twitter has forged in recent months in an effort to make its service the home to live events. \nRelated to this, Twitter also today announced a deal with both Tubefilter and dcp to air the 7th Annual Streamy Awards this fall. \nTwitter and dcp had already worked together along with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to bring a live stream from the Golden Globes red carpet show to its network earlier in January. The event did fairly well, bringing in 2.7 million users, who watched the event live on Twitter. In addition, dick clark productions said the Globes were tweeted about 4.7 million times, up from 4.4 million last year.

For example, its NFL deal to stream Thursday Night Football has been bringing in more viewers, Twitter said this fall, noting that the then three most recent games reached just under 3 million viewers, up 28 percent from the first game’s draw of 2.35 million viewers. \nThe first of the new live red carpet streams will be the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards which takes place on April 2nd. That will be followed by the red carpet pre-shows for the Billboard Music Awards on May 21st and the American Music Awards in November. \nImage credit: Getty Images/Mark Davis/NBC 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T17:38:46.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
