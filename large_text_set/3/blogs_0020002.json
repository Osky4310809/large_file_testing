Wiper has said it will field candidates, but none of the aspirants matches Joho’s popularity. In Kiambu, incumbent Governor William Kabogo still enjoys an edge at 46 per cent against Babayao’s 33 per cent. In Machakos, Governor Alfred Mutua of Maendeleo Chap Chap has the support of two thirds of voters there.

A majority of Mombasa county residents (66 per cent) feel closest to Nasa while 23 per cent are close to Jubilee Party,” the firm said in a report. \nThe opposition National Super Alliance brings together the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), Ford Kenya, Wiper Democratic Movement and the Amani National Congress (ANC) parties. \nThe survey done on March 16 and 18, two days after the President left Mombasa, shows that one in ten people are still undecided on whom to vote for. \nBut Mr Joho still commands runaway popularity.

This is because there are a number of strong candidates vying for one seat under the same party,” she said at the firm’s offices at Lenana Towers. \nSenator Hassan Omar has a marginal edge to retain the seat at 13 per cent in a county where six in ten people are undecided on whom to vote in for senator. \nBut Mr Omar has said he wants to be governor. \nYet this study shows he commands support of only 7 per cent. \nThis means that even if the Jubilee candidate, Wiper's Mr Omar plus Hezron Awiti and those still undecided are put together, Mr Joho could still win by half of votes. \nPARTY AFFILIATION \nWhen polled, Mombasa people responded based on their party affiliations \nEighty-four per cent of the 363 declared Nasa supporters disapproved the decision by the police to bar the governor from attending the re-launch of Mtongwe ferry by President Kenyatta. \nMore than half (54 per cent of 126 Jubilee loyalists) sided with the police action to keep Mr Joho away, although a third of Jubilee supporters reprimand the security agencies for blocking the governor. \nThe study also tracked the politics in Machakos and Kiambu counties ahead of the coming elections and the findings suggest that party popularity does not always tally with the popularity of candidates in those counties. \nMAENDELEO CHAP CHAP \nIn Machakos, incumbent Governor Alfred Mutua who ditched Wiper and formed Maendeleo Chap Chap has the support of two thirds of voters there. But his Chap Chap party trails Nasa in popularity. \nIn Machakos, more than half (54 per cent) of people there feel “closest’ to Nasa. \nBut aspirants affiliated to Nasa, Bernard Kiala and Peter Mathuki, both of Wiper, Wavinya Ndeti of CCU and the undecided, all add up to just a third of Dr Mutua’s popularity at 26 per cent. \nPeople there do not support Nasa as a party, but as an alliance. \nJust five per cent said they support Nasa as a political party with more than a third of the voters saying they support Wiper (38 per cent). \nIn Kiambu, nine in ten people are closest to Jubilee. \nAnd while the county expects a fierce fight between incumbent William Kabogo and Kabete MP Ferdinand Babayao, Mr Kabago still enjoys an edge at 46 per cent against Babayao’s 33 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:32:54.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
