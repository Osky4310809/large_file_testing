He first joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger , and by the time Avengers 4 rolls around, he’ll have played the character in 7 films total (not including popping up in post-credits scenes and being impersonated by Loki). He could certainly be forgiven for wanting to move on or stay put and build his retirement fund. In recent years, Evans suggested he was leaning towards the former, telling Variety in 2014 that he planned to start directing once his contract was up. \nBut maybe that big fight in Civil War has old Cap rethinking the pending split, because he now tells Collider that he’d like to continue to be an Avenger. It just might not be up to him at this point: \nAfter Avengers 4 , my contract is done. Talk to Marvel. If we engage further, I’d be open to it. I love the character. It’s almost like high school. You certainly always look to senior year, and then, all of a sudden, senior year happens and you’re like, “I don’t know if I’m ready to go.” It’s tough thinking about not playing the guy. \nIn the past, the ever-charming Evans has opened up about his anxiety over taking on the role in the first place, as well as trying to keep up with the expanding MCU. Back in 2010, he admitted it “wasn’t an easy yes” because of all the hubbub around big-budget films: “I get nervous in things like this and Captain America just means a lot of this . I was in a really happy place in my life; kind of in a happy medium place in my career and Captain America just changes things and there’s no ‘off’ switch once you walk down that road.” But even if there is a change in the Avengers roster, at least Evans can keep playing superhero in real life . \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:26:28.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
