It’s only been a week and Donald Trump is reinventing the presidency. \nAmid a torrent of action, disruption and protest, the new President’s moves on trade, immigration and foreign policy have honored his campaign promises — and dramatically reshaped Washington’s role in national and global affairs. \nSome things are clear at the end of this jarring week. Trump won’t have an epiphany and suddenly embrace Beltway conventions. As president, he will keep conjuring his own reality and is happy to use the backdrop of the White House to advance his many rhetorical wars. \nHis staff is learning how to work together as they jockey for power. And amid it all, Trump still manages to surprise: Lawmakers and business leaders say the larger than life president and former reality show star listens more than he talks. \nBut his unorthodox style is also raising questions about whether a presidency built on creative destruction will simply exhaust the political system. Trump’s conveyer belt of executive orders is an effective symbolic device, but they are noticeably lacking in details and actionable plans. Sooner or later, he will have to show proficiency in the harder task of shepherding his agenda through Congress. \nTrump’s first week in office leaves one fundamental question in its wake: Can he successfully govern a complicated and divided country without bringing his erratic behavior under control? For now, there is no answer. \n… \nBut the determination to keep campaign promises is verging on an obsession inside the Trump White House . \nSorry, CNN. \nTrump’s main sticking point was that he’d honor his promises and that he wasn’t a politician. \nDon’t worry, though. \nWhen you guys grow up you’ll see that conservative policies work and liberals policies don’t.
