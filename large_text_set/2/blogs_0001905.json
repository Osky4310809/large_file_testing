Nancy Pelosi (R-CA) about her support for sanctuary cities, and asked Pelosi which of her grandchildren she views as expendable enough to be murdered by someone who isn't legally in the country. \nWatch the exchange here: \nWhile Pelosi did express sympathy to Mrs. Wilkerson over the murder of her child, she also attempted to fact-check her to see if she lived in a sanctuary city. The Wilkersons lived near Houston, which was a sanctuary city, but did not live in Houston proper. She also then tried to say that most people in this country illegally are not in fact breaking the law. \nExcept...that their entire presence in the country is against the law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:03:14.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
