Tolchin said the form is used when a green card holder decides to return to their homeland and give up their U.S. residency.\nFederal immigration law states that when a returning permanent resident is seeking admission, the government cannot bar them, she said.\nThe agents’ action would appear to escalate the seriousness of legal violations that immigration attorneys say occurred over the weekend at LAX. In such cases, agents were not only asking questions that kept the detainees from entering the country but taking action that could revoke their residency.\n\nKPCC is attempting to reach Customs and Border Protection for a response. Immigration officials have not answered questions about the number of people detained at LAX and how many may still be held.
