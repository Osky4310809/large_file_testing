Then, the movie ended… and we were going to be taken up on stage, but not until the credits were over.”\n“So, we had some time to sit there and, as I sat there I realized there will never be a better, a more perfect, a more sensitive, emotional, and beautiful way of saying au revoir to Charles Xavier than this movie,” Patrick explained. “So, I told [ Hugh ] that same evening, ‘I’m done too. It’s all over.’”\nDon’t miss Logan when it hits theaters on March 3!
