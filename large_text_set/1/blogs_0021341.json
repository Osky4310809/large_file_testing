People who use it are often branded as lazy and undisciplined and many people believe that getting those additional ten minutes every morning can seriously wreck your circadian rhythm. \nAnd who hasn’t almost overslept at least once because the siren call of snooze was just a little too hard to ignore? \nIf you are one of those people, science has some good news for you: You may well be more intelligent, more creative and even happier than those who manage to jump out of bed at the first ring. Night Owls might be smarter... These smart alarm clocks can help you to be a better morning person \nThe British study \"Why night owls are more intelligent\" links snoozing to creativity, intelligence and an independent spirit. The authors Satoshi Kanazawa and Kaja Perina argue that we are far better adapted to living (and sleeping) like our ancestors did — which means getting to bed early and getting up early in the morning — and that being particularly adaptable to modern life is a sign of outstanding intelligence. \nIn plain terms this means: It takes a smart person to deal with the snooze button because it is a very recent invention that evolution itself has done nothing to prepare us for. \nThis second correlation might be a bit more intuitive: If we learn to listen to our own body’s needs and not to the hard and fast rules of our clocks, we are more likely to pursue our own passions and find our own solutions to problems. This makes us more creative and independent.

While night owls are happier and smarter, there are still significant risk factors associated with staying in bed too long. People who spend 12 or more hours in bed have been shown to have a significantly higher risk of untimely death. \nSo what does this mean? \nHit that snooze button and don’t worry about it! Just make sure to go to bed a little later. That way you also have enough time to complete all your amazingly creative projects. \nRead the original article on Business Insider DE More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:00:09.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
