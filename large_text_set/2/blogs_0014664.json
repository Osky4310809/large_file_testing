It’s now been announced that the Atlanta star has been cast as Simba in Disney’s remake of Lion King. \nDirected by Jon Favreau ( Iron Man, The Jungle Book), it will be a live-action adaption of the 1994 classic, arguably one of Disney’s best animated films. In addition, James Earl Jones will reprise his role as Mufasa, who also voiced Darth Vader in each Star Wars the villain featured in. The movie is set for release in 2018 which likely means production is already underway.\nIn other entertainment news, the new Power Rangers trailer gives us a closer look at the Megazords.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:42:30.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
