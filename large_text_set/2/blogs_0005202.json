The more empowering magic we can find on the internet these days, the better! Too, we love people who use their voices for good, and Chelsea Clinton’s Twitter is loaded with feminist goodness and so many amazing takes on what’s going on in politics these days.\nFor one, she’s refused to hold back when she sees something wrong taking place in the country she holds dear. Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks.\n— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017 There’s so much uplift to be found on Chelsea Clinton’s Twitter. She writes such amazing messages! Yes. We will keep standing up for a country that matches our values and ideals for all. pic.twitter.com/yfVlX5sL3f \n— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 29, 2017 Plus, we’ve learned that she’s so much more like us than we ever would’ve expected, as we’re also Thin Mints-obsessed. This map makes me miss my grandma. Every state she ever lived in shares her love of Thin Mints https://t.co/70qldbEf1s \n— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 5, 2017 And she shares self care tips and tricks, like scrolling through pages of adorable elephants. Some people look at cats for a break, I look at elephants. This picture makes me so happy. Thank you Sheldrick Trust for all you do https://t.co/5JedfDgoIE \n— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017 TBH, the more of her tweets we read, the more we fall in love with this intelligent and lovely lady. Excited to be packing diapers & books for a #DayOfAction w @2SmallToFail , @ClintonFdn , @penguinkids , & @diapernetwork !\n— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 2, 2017 But at the end of the day, what we’ve learned the most from Chelsea Clinton’s Twitter is that social media makes it possible for all of us to reach a wide audience and learn from each other in seriously incredible ways. And how cool is that?!\nH/T People \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:24:30.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
