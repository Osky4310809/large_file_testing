In a new interview with io9 , Reitman explained he’s working on both an animated movie he hopes will be released in 2019 or 2020 and some live-action projects. “We jumped into an animated film [after the last movie] and we are developing live-action films,“ he said. “I want to bring all these stories together as a universe that makes sense within itself. Part of my job right now is to do that.” \nIt’s unclear if the animated venture to which he’s referring has any relation to the animated television show that’s reportedly in the works called Ghostbuster: Ecto Force . Also unknown: Whether there are any plans to bring back the team led by Melissa McCarthy or whether any of the “live-action films” he alluded to are somehow related to the dude-centric reboot that had Channing Tatum attached . Reitman was speaking to io9 upon the release of the home VR experience Ghostbusters VR: Now Hiring , so at least one Ghostbusters -related endeavor has come to fruition. \n[Note: io9 , like The A.V.
