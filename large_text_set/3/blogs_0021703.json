Watson recently spoke to the Irish Independent about the legacy of portraying both Hermione Granger and Beauty and the Beast 's Belle, both of whom defy the expectations of their peers and seek grand adventure and knowledge.\n\"I've always said, stuff the engagement ring!

Otherwise, if I don't listen to myself, I'd feel a bit lost in it all.\"\nAs a UN ambassador , vocal feminist and founder of her own book club , Watson herself is a personification of the character traits she so admires and loves to play on screen.\nWATCH: Emma Watson reveals the deeper message in 'Beauty and the Beast'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:51:01.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
