The use of the vehicle to attack civilians a direct copy of an Islamic State tactic used previously with murderous effect in Nice and Berlin. \nThe vehicle then careered off the street onto pavement a few meters away from Big Ben and the attacker tried to storm parliament armed with a knife. Moments later, an police officer who was guarding parliament was stabbed and killed. The attacker, dressed in black, was shot by another armed officer and died of his injuries. Westminster attack: Theresa May praises 'exceptional bravery' of police and security services - live Read more \nThe Guardian understands the initial working theories of the police investigation are the attacker was inspired by Isis and was most likely a “lone actor”. The attacker’s identity was already known to counter-terrorism officials. \nTheresa May was rushed out of parliament as the attack unfolded and later chaired an emergency meaning of the government’s crisis committee, Cobra. Shortly before 9pm on Wednesday, her voice cracking with emotion, the prime minister confirmed that what she called the “sick and depraved” attack had been carried out by a single assailant. \nShe also praised the bravery of the police and other emergency services, who “ran towards the danger, even as they encouraged others to move the other way”. \nThe prime minister added that Britain’s threat level would remain at severe, where it has been for some time; but she struck a defiant tone, insisting it would be business as usual for MPs and Londoners on Thursday. \n“The location of this attack was no accident. The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech.” Attack at parliament Attack at parliament – map \nMark Rowley, head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, said:   happen – but sadly it is now a reality.” \nOn Wednesday night, a massive investigation involving Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command and domestic security service MI5 was underway. Police chiefs have ordered extra officers, armed and unarmed, on to the streets on the capital. British officials have watched how attack after attack has left their near neighbours in France in a state of emergency since 2015, and will be anxious to prevent any further attacks. \nParliament was filled with MPs a couple of hours after prime minister’s question time, who had been alerted by the sound of shots being fired. Within minutes, David Lidington, the leader of the House of Commons, told stunned MPs: “What I am able to say to the House is there has been a serious incident within the estate. It seems that a police officer has been stabbed, that the alleged assailant was shot by armed police.” A visual guide to the Westminster attack Read more \nEyewitnesses described how a scene of horror suddenly unfolded at what is one of the UK’s busiest tourist spots.   Westminster Bridge with a colleague when he saw a 4x4 vehicle travelling at high speed, hitting pedestrians. \nHe said: “I heard a wheel definitely hit a kerb, quite a loud crunch noise, I looked up and saw a car clearly hitting people as it came towards me. A colleague   hit. And then the car just carried on up the bridge and I just looked around and was really in shock.” \nRadoslaw Sikorski saw at least five   after being “mown down” by a car. “I heard what I thought what I thought was just a collision and then I looked through the window of the taxi and someone down, obviously in great distress,” he said. \nPictures emerged after the incident showing people lying injured on Westminster Bridge, some of them bleeding seriously. A woman was pulled alive from the River Thames with serious injuries after having fallen into the water during the attack. \nThe car then sped towards the Palace of Westminster, and came to a halt on the pavement, up against railings to the north of New Palace Yard, the green space adjacent to Big Ben, opposite an entrance to Westminster tube station. \nA man with a knife was then seen running through the gates of the Palace of Westminster, across New Palace Yard and stabbing a police officer. The attacker continued his rampage, targeting a second officer, according to witnesses, but was shot by police as he approached the second officer clutching his knife. \nEyewitness Rick Longley said he saw the car crashed into the railings and a man leap out. He said: “We were just walking up to the station and there was a loud bang and a guy, someone, crashed a car and took some pedestrians out. \n“They were just laying there and then the whole crowd just surged around the corner by the gates just opposite Big Ben. A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman.” UK terror attacks since 11 September 2001 Read more \nIn the aftermath of the attack, the Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood helped treat the injured officer, unsuccessfully trying to resuscitate them. The Bournemouth MP, a former soldier, was pictured with blood on his forehead, helping the police officer in Parliament Square. His brother Jonathan was killed in the 2002 Bali terror attack. \nTwo people could be seen lying within New Palace Yard, immediately outside Westminster Hall. The sitting in the House of Commons was suspended while police officers sealed off the area. Staff inside parliament were told to stay inside their offices. Minutes after the incident, an air ambulance landed in Parliament Square, as sirens were heard outside, but the officer could not be saved. \nKen Marsh, chair of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: “This incident sadly shows the dangers our colleagues face on a daily basis. They show incredible bravery protecting the public.” \nUp to 1,000 people were evacuated for hours at various locations, including Westminster Abbey. Parliament was evacuated slowly with it taking several hours for people to be let out. \nHospitals in London were put on alert and of the 20 injured, eight were taken to the major trauma centre at King’s College hospital, with two people in critical condition and six stable. Those at Kings were six men and two women. Two casualties were treated at St Thomas’s hospital, immediately opposite the Houses of Parliament, a man and a woman, both of whom are stable. The ambulance service said eight of those injured were treated at the scene. \nIn a statement the Muslim Council of Britain said: “We condemn this attack and while it is still too early to speculate on the motives, our thoughts and prayers are for the victims and those affected. We pay tribute too to the police and emergency services who handled this with bravery. The Palace of Westminster is the centre of our democracy and we must all ensure that it continues to serve our country and its people with safety and security.” \nLondon mayor Sadiq Khan said: ““London is the greatest city in the world and we stand together in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life. We always have, and we always will. Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:53:28.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
