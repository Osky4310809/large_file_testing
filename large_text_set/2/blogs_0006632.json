Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA teenager who didn't want his little sister to miss out on a school dance because she didn't have a dad to go with has won the hearts of people all over the world. \nMohammad Hasher, 17, had come downstairs last weekend to find his six-year-old sister, Noor, sitting on the couch looking upset. \nShe told him that there was a father-daughter dance at her school and, even though she couldn't go because her parents are divorced, she still wanted to wear a dress at home, \nKind-hearted Mohammad, not wanting his sister to be the only one to miss out on the dance, immediately offered to go with her and took her out to buy a new outfit. Noor and Mohammad are close (Photo: Mohammad Hasher) \nMohammad, from Michigan, USA, told Mirror Online: \"I took her because I didn't want her to be the one to go to school that Monday and have to tell her teacher she wasn't able to go because she doesn't have a dad. \n\"I wanted her to have a fun time, that's what childhood is about! Having fun, laughing, and enjoying life. The pair had a great night at the dance (Photo: Mohammad Hasher) \n\"As a family, we have been going through a lot so she deserves to enjoy herself.\" \nAnd enjoy herself she did. Mohammad said she was \"very pleased\" as \"she got to hang out with friends, won some candy, and danced the night away!\" Mohammad posted pics of Noor on Snapchat and Twitter (Photo: Mohammad Hasher) \nHe even won the 'best Dad' prize for his \"crazy dancing\" (his words, not ours). \nMohammad tweeted pictures of himself with his sister at the event, along with the caption: \"Got to take my baby sister to her first daddy daughter dance the other night. Sorry you don't have a dad but I'll always be there for you\" complete with a heart emoji. \nAnd he basically broke hearts all over the world. \nMohammad told BuzzFeed: \"We’ve had to move states, been homeless, and have struggled continuously for the past few months. \n\"It has all been very hard on us, but we are thankful for how close it has brought us to each other.” \n\"To me [the dance] meant so much. It sort of gave me a wake-up call on how important it is to be there for her.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T19:40:04.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
