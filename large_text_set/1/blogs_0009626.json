Size or technique? What really matters? Men unanimously agree that size doesn't matter. It's all in the way how you use your tool. Women seem to be undecided. So, we decided to clinch this once and for all. What is it that makes sex good, and good sex great? Smriti, 33 If there's no technique - size - specifically girth helps. A girl needs something! But, essentially, both matter. As far as technique, people either have it or don't. The right technique, and the right size. But, if I had to pick one, I'd go with technique over size any day. Parul, 29 I've been with a guy who had a lot of technique but he could have been \"blessed\" with a bigger size. Didn't do anything for me. But if the size is good, and the technique isn't, that's a no-no. But really big is quite uncomfortable for me. Basically, both. You can teach technique but in that moment, we all do what naturally comes to us, and if I don't like it, I won't do it again. Size, not small, not big. If we're talking about relationships specifically and the sex isn't good, don't cry when your partner goes and sleeps with someone else! Shivani, 27 What's a decent tolerable small size, though? I think I haven't been with a tiny person. Medium and large. No small. So, my answer is size. I can teach the technique no rocket science, but if it's chhotu I will be sad and weird. Who even came up with this technique matters theory? Riddhi, 23 Size matters. Technique can be developed with time, I guess? But, yeah, not too big. That can be uncomfortable. Ipshita, 31 Compassion matters. I have no idea about anything else. But, I got a man's perspective. He says tantra matters. It hits all the spots. Anonymous, 32 Definitely technique. As long as he knows how to use it. I'm not too sure about too small, though. But, average sized penises if they know what they're doing can be awesome! I have been with this one man in the past who has a small penis, and was bad with it. He compensated with other things. B, 27 Unless you're talking about a donkey dick or Mr. Barely there, size doesn't matter. Technique trumps, always. Mainly because men usually try harder to compensate if they think that they aren't THAT well-endowed. Also, I'm narrow, so it's more about the build-up, the slow easing-in, rather than the whole show ending with a few pumps. (Also, hello, blow jobs!) Amrah, 29 Size matters... but more than length, girth matters! And, of course, technique, too. SB, 30 BIG COCK FEELS GREAT INSIDE! I will not lie. But that said, if you are screwing a guy with a big dick who is a total tool, he could make you feel like shit and the sex will feel crappy. And it might hurt, especially if he hasn't bothered to get you off, or ensure that you are adequately wet. To be honest, technique makes a HUGE difference. So, unless the dude you are with has a micropenis, big cock, small cock is no biggie. What matters is if he is generous, knows what the fuck he is doing down there, believes in pleasuring you orally, believes in killer foreplay, makes sure he listens to you when you tell him what you like, and is invested in you to make sure that you are having fun while you are bumping and grinding... If he checks all these boxes, chances are that the sex will turn out to be great! Because, fun fact, penetration for women is usually the last thing where their orgasms come from anyway. Sam, 27 If you have size, it's a good thing. But, technique matters because otherwise you can really hurt the girl. Though, it's not like technique will help if it's too small. It should be above average. Bottom line, size does matter. I'm sorry, gentlemen! Anonymous, 29 Size, definitely. There's no such thing as bad sex, actually, except when there's no sensation. Which is what happens if it's too small. You don't even feel it. What's the point in that? But, if the guy is well-endowed, then he doesn't need to work very hard, and neither do you. Dessidre, 26 A little bit of size, a little more position and a LOT of technique equals magic! In short, we want it all! We want to say that size doesn't matter, because... politeness. But, really, what are we to do if we can't tell your finger from your... you know? They say that a good life is made out of equal parts of chance and choice. Your size is your chance. Your technique is your choice. And orgasms is ours!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T08:47:12.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
