ADVERTISEMENT \nBeijing seized Scarborough in 2012 after a prolonged standoff with Philippine vessels. Taiwan also includes the island in its South China Sea claims. \nThe other stations mentioned by Xiao would be situated on features in the Paracel island group that China has controlled since seizing parts away from Vietnam in 1974. \nAlso this week, the commander in chief of China’s navy, Vice Adm. Shen Jinlong, noted improving relations in a meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart, Rear Adm. Pham Hoai Nam, in Beijing. \nChina and Vietnam have had long-running territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Tensions spiked in 2014 after China parked an oil rig near Vietnam’s central coast, sparking mass protests in Vietnam. \nThe two navies and their countries should “together play a positive role in maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea,” Shen was quoted as saying by China’s defense ministry. \nSouth China Sea tensions have eased somewhat since Beijing erupted in fury last year after a Hague-based arbitration tribunal ruled on a case filed by the Philippines, invalidating China’s sweeping territorial claims and determining that China violated the rights of Filipinos to fish at Scarborough Shoal. \nREAD: China’s artificial islands violates international law–tribunal \nChina has since allowed Filipino fishermen to return to the shoal following Philippine   calls for closer ties between the countries, but it does not recognize the tribunal’s ruling as valid and insists it has historical claims to almost the entire South China Sea, through which an estimated $5 trillion in global trade passes each year. \nChina’s creation of seven man-made islands in the disputed Spratly group, complete with airstrips and military installations, has drawn criticism from the U.S. and others and focused attention on Beijing’s long-term plans for Scarborough. \nREAD: PH protests China weapons on man-made isles \nU.S. diplomats have said privately that reclamation work on the shoal would be seen as crossing a red line because of its proximity to the main Philippine islands. \nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson compared China’s island-building and deployment of military assets to Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, and suggesting China’s access to the island should not be allowed. \nThe topic is likely to be high on the agenda when Tillerson visits Beijing for talks with top officials on Saturday and Sunday. \nChina, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei have long contested ownership of the South China Sea, which straddles one of the world’s busiest sea lanes and is believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil and gas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T08:02:02.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
