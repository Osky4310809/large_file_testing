They have been in contact with teams for the second consecutive season about Okafor. \nHe's still on the roster because the Sixers haven't received the offers they deemed good enough to move the big man. \nOkafor's trade value isn't as high as expected of someone who was selected with the third overall pick in the 2015 draft out of Duke. A lot of that has to do with defensive shortcomings, lingering left-knee soreness and/or questions about last season's well-documented off-the-court incidents. \nThe Sixers could opt to move Noel, whose rookie contract expires at the end of the season. But like Okafor, Noel's trade value also suffers. In his case, a lot of it has to do with becoming a free agent this summer. He'll become a restricted one if the team he finishes the season with grants him a qualifying offer. In that scenario, that squad will have the ability to match any offer he receives. \nIf the team does not give him a qualifying deal, Noel will become an unrestricted free agent and have the ability to sign with any team. \nBut for now, it's a wait-and-see situation on what the Sixers do by Thursday's deadline. They could opt to part ways with Noel and/or Okafor. They could also decide to package one of the centers with another player to make a deal work. \nThe thing we do know is that the Sixers have had advanced talks regarding Okafor. \nA league source agreed with an NBA.com report that the Los Angeles Lakers could be a possible destination for the second-year player. The website reported that the Sacramento Kings are another possibility. So are the Indiana Pacers, according to ESPN. \nThe New Orleans Pelicans, Denver Nuggets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Chicago Bulls were teams that had expressed some interest. However, sources have said the Nuggets are no longer interested. \nOkafor, however, said the Sixers haddiscussions with 10 or 11 teams. \n\"Whether it's here or somewhere else, I'm just waiting for 3 o'clock to happen,\" he said of learning his destination after the trade deadline, \"so I can continue with my career. I can start doing what I love to do, and that's continue to play basketball.\" Sixers notes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:11:11.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
