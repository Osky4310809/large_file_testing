Ali Price, Stuart Hogg and Finn Russell bask in the win over Wales, Scotland's first in a decade \n\"We were competitive at the breakdown so all in all I'm happy we came away with the win. \n\"We will enjoy the evening, it's been a few years since we beat Wales. The boys can have a couple of quiet, cold beers. Then we go down to England. \n\"There are a number of reasons why we should prepare well for that game. \n\"I think these experiences for the young players are great. John (Barclay) did a great job out there and steadied the ship.\" \nBarclay captained Scotland from the back-row, the Scarlets flanker becoming only the fourth of 14 Scotland skippers in the Six Nations era to have tasted victory in his first game leading the team. \nThe 30-year-old was cautiously optimistic about Scotland's chances on 11 March against England, who can re-take top spot in the Six Nations table with victory over Italy on Sunday. \nHe told BBC Sport: \"We recovered from a poor first half to go on and beat a very good Welsh side. \n\"We tightened up in the second half, the tackle area and we've got some backs who can mix it with anyone and we gave them ball. \n\"We have beaten Ireland, who are a very good team, and we've beaten Wales, who are a very good team too. \n\"We believe within the group that we can do something. We go to England for the next game. We'll have a look at them. If we play well, we can win. Harlequins wing Tim Visser ran in Scotland's second try and proved effective in defence too \n\"If we play like we did in Paris, if we play like we did in the first half (against Wales), then it becomes very difficult.\" \nGlasgow Warriors stand-off Russell knocked over all five penalties and was successful with his two conversions. \n\"It's not very often I hit 100% so I was happy I kept the boys on the front foot and kept the scoreboard ticking over,\" he said. \n\"I was happy with my kicking today. \n\"The boys were awesome. We knew how tough it was going to be, especially with both teams coming off a loss. The second half performance was absolutely outstanding. \n\"I am so proud of the boys. We knew if we were in the game we would be good enough to get a couple of tries on the board in the second half. We dug deep. It was similar to the Ireland game, so it was good.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T21:38:33.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
