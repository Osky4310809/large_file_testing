(ANI) \nIn a light-hearted taunt, the Goa chief minister, Manohar Parrikar told the Congress leader Digvijay Singh that while they were slow in going to the governor with their numbers, the BJP formed the party. He said, “Aap Goa mein aaraam se ghoomte rahe, aur hum sarkaar bana paaye”. This was a direct dig at the Congress leader who was also in-charge of Goa for the assembly elections. Aap Goa mein aaraam se ghoomte rahe, aur hum sarkaar bana paaye: Goa CM Manohar Parrikar in Rajya Sabha to Congress leader Digvijaya Singh pic.twitter.com/mugWbtPeGG \n— ANI (@ANI_news) March 31, 2017 \nIt may be recalled that BJP had effectively stitched up numbers even before Congress could realize. It was a case of BJP outsmarting the Congress inspite of it having the majority votes and that was what Goa CM, Manohar Parrikar was referring to. “In a hung assembly, if majority of the elected MLAs form a coalition, the Governor would be constitutionally right in inviting the leader of the majority coalition to form the government and prove their majority on the floor of the house. \nGovernor Mridula Sinha invited Parrikar to form the next government after he submitted a letter of support from 21 legislators to the Governor first. A miffed Congress moved the Supreme Court challenging Sinha’s decision. The hurriedly filed petition late in the evening was mentioned at the residence of Chief Justice J S Kehar . \nWatch this also: \nEven though Congress had gone to the Supreme Court saying that the legitimate right to form government was with them as they had a greater number of seats, the apex court after posing tough questions to Congress party had sent them back, and ordered floor test instead. The Congress had won 28 seats in Manipur, followed by the BJP with 21. The NPP and the NPF have won four seats each, while the LJP and the Trinamool Congress bagged one seat each.
