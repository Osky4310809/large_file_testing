For thousands of years, trees have inspired poets, scientists, warriors, and priests, and they remain a living symbol of the glory of the natural world and its importance in our lives. Take a look at this collection of images showing the world's largest tree, oldest tree, biggest tree, tallest tree, and other great trees. \nAnd if this list inspires you, take a look at some magnificent trees that fell victim to vandals, drunks, psychopaths, and other people who would kill a tree . Jason Todd/The Image Bank/Getty Images 1. The Oldest Tree in the World \nIt's not always easy to date a living tree, but most experts agree that a bristlecone pine tree ( Pinus longaeva ) in California's Inyo National Forest , nicknamed Methuselah, was 4,843 years old in 2012. Another bristlecone pine growing in Nevada was cut down in 1964 to be age-dated -- that tree, nicknamed Prometheus, was 4,844 years old when the tree was killed . The exact location of Methuselah (and many other famous trees) is kept secret due to fears of vandalism. Other contenders for world's oldest tree include the Llangernyw Yew in North Wales, estimated to be 4,000 to 5,000 years old, and an evergreen Fitzroya cupressoides in Chile that's 3,622 years old. \ncontinue reading below our video How to Go Bold with Color at Home Pando, a clonal cluster of aspen trees, may be the world's oldest living thing. Wikimedia 2. The World's Oldest Clonal Trees \nThe record above for the world's oldest tree is for a single individual, or non-clonal, tree. But some trees grow as clones of a parent tree through a very old root system. Such is the case with Old Tjikko, a Norway spruce tree ( Picea abies ) that's been growing in Sweden for an estimated 9,550 years. But even that old-timer pales in comparison to the clonal cluster of quaking aspens ( Populus tremuloides ) in Utah -- genetic testing has revealed that this small forest of clonal trees, named Pando, is about 80,000 years old. Considered to be one organism, it's estimated weight is over 6,000 tons, making it not only the oldest living thing on Earth but also the heaviest. General Sherman, the world's largest tree.

The Largest Tree in the World \nIn terms of sheer volume, the giant sequoia ( Sequoiadendron giganteum ) known as General Sherman is a monster of a tree -- at 52,508 cubic feet, it's the world's largest tree, and perhaps the world's largest living thing. General Sherman is located in California's Sequoia National Park and is one of the park's premier attractions. The closest rival is a coast redwood ( Sequoia sempervirens ), nicknamed Lost Monarch, located somewhere in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park in northern California. Lost Monarch measures about 42,500 cubic feet. The world's tallest tree, a coastal redwood. Getty Images 4. The Tallest Tree in the World \nCalifornia is home to several record-busting trees, including the tallest tree in the world: Hyperion, a 379.1-foot-tall coast redwood ( Sequoia sempervirens ) located somewhere in Redwood National Park (the exact location is a secret, due to concerns over vandalism). Centurion, a eucalyptus tree ( Eucalyptus regnans ) in Tasmania, is next in line at 331.4 feet. Arbol del tule, the world's widest tree. Wikimedia 5. The Widest Tree in the World \nIt's not the tallest or the largest in terms of overall volume, but the tree with the widest girth in the world is the Arbol del Tule, a Montezuma cypress ( Taxodium mucronatum ) located in Oaxaca, Mexico . Measured at the standard breast height (about 4 feet, 3 inches above ground), the massive Arbol del Tule is an astounding 38.1 feet in diameter. A few of California's redwood and sequoia trees come close, but none can match Arbol del Tule. The sacred Bodhi tree. Wikimedia 6. A Very Sacred Tree \nTrees have been important religious symbols since the dawn of time -- consider the mythical Tree of Life, the biblical Tree of Knowledge and Yggdrasil from Norse mythology. In Buddhism , it was beneath a spreading fig tree (aptly named Ficus religiosa ) that the Buddha achieved supreme enlightenment or Bodhi. A living tree in India, planted in 288 B.C., is called the Bodhi tree because it is believed to have been propagated from the Buddha's original fig tree; the Bodhi tree and the nearby Mahabodhi Temple are now important Buddhist pilgrimage sites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T19:07:45.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
