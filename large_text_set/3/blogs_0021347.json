A gore-fest written in two parts and running to 10 acts, Tamburlaine has defeated better resourced companies, on far bigger stages, than the British east Asian company Yellow Earth – whose adaptation at the Arcola pares it back to a mere two and half hours, using a predominantly female cast and returning the story to its Asian origins. \nNg Choon Ping’s production is played out on a bare stage with a screen offering handy clarification on who is portraying each character in a cast charged with many roles. It has a stylish simplicity – there is no hint of blood or any scent of real violence until the final half hour. In this version, the caged Bajazeth (Melody Brown) and his wife, Zabina (Susan Hingley), don’t bash their brains out but expire with just a nod of the head. Even in a cut-down version there is plenty to be exhausted by in this tale of barbaric atrocities and colonising ambition. There is no getting away from the fact that this man, who during his advances across the globe is estimated to have slaughtered 5% of the world’s population, is viewed as something of a flawed hero by Marlowe – when now, of course, we would put him on trial as a war criminal.

It also shows how a toxic masculinity infects both public and private discourse as only Tamburlaine’s idea of what it means to be a man holds sway. \nThe predominantly female cast, led by Lourdes Faberes as a Tamburlaine who has an icy power rather than fiery energy, serve to highlight the absurdities and dangers of all this excessive testosterone. Love, as experienced by Fiona Hampton’s Zenocrate – who becomes rather enamoured by her warmongering husband – is just another kind of slavery. \nDespite a game cast and the clarity of the staging, this is not an easy play to like. The young Marlowe was good at poetry and epic sweep, but Tamburlaine is more about pomp than psychological acuity and depth. It would be a few years before Elizabethan theatre created characters with an inner life. \nThe effect is of one damned thing after another, as Tamburlaine crosses the world bringing terror and leaving death and destruction in his wake. By the end, when it turns out that the one thing he can’t conquer is death, he seems rather tired.
