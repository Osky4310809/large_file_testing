It was only when he got a phone call from his cousin Bill that he knew the video had been seen by many. \n“You see someone that needs help,” adds McGinty, “you just want to help. We all push for that goal and we all train.” \nThe cousins, who run this course almost every weekend together, said they didn’t worry about jeopardizing their times to help her. \n“Kudos to these Heroes helping the woman walk across the finish line,” wrote one person on the news outlet’s Facebook page.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:52:43.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
