Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA student who was left brain damaged after taking a deadly new drug has ­spoken of his harrowing ordeal. \nJordan Hawthorne, 21, suffered a seizure and spent five days in a coma after smoking really strong Vertex, a cannabis-like drug. \nThe former legal high , like the drug Spice, is believed to have caused several deaths in Europe and is being sold for just £10 a gram. \nJordan, 21, of Plymouth, Devon, said: “I have never been so close to death. It was so severe that I don’t remember it.

As soon as I started smoking it I couldn’t speak. I was dribbling. My girlfriend had to feed me, dress me, put me to bed.” \nJordan has been left with memory ­problems and must take anti-epilepsy medicine for the rest of his life. Legal highs have caused several deaths Vertex is being sold for £10 a gram Read More Mother of teenage girl almost killed from taking Spice labels the drug a 'murder weapon' \nDealers have snapped up Vertex, which was lawful until last year’s legal highs ban, to peddle to vulnerable teenagers. \nJodie, 17, said for £10 she can buy a gram of the drug – also known as Space Cadet – from a dealer in Liverpool. \nShe said: “This is ­lethal stuff. Dealers are now selling them like they sell white ­[cocaine] or brown [heroin]. Read More \n“It makes your muscles go tense and your heartbeat race. I know people who’ve puked up blood. I shouldn’t have it, I know it’s bad but once you’re hooked it’s hard to get off.” \nOther users, including a girl of 14, have been rushed to hospital in the North West. Jordan will now have to take medication for the rest of his life (Photo: SWNS +44 (0)1179066550) \nCheshire Police Assist Chief Constable Mark Roberts said: “This is a ticking time bomb. We’re keen to warn as many people as possible about Vertex.” \nLast week the Sunday People ran pictures of Spice takers slumped, zombie-like, in the street and investigated sales of the drug in Bristol, Manchester and Blackpool. \nSpice is sold on the dark web for £2.50 a gram, and is being sent to UK addresses then passed to street distributors who target areas where homeless people gather.
