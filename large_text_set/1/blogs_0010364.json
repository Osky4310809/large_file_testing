Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMauricio Pochettino wants Dele Alli to carry on being “naughty” after turning him into Tottenham ’s penalty box “killer.” \nIn-form Alli got a three-game retrospective ban after punching West Brom’s Claudio Yacob during a game at White Hart Lane last April. \nBut as Albion prepare to return for Saturday's early kickoff, boss Pochettino says he wants midfielder Alli to keep that little bit of devil in his game after pushing him further forward in recent weeks to get among the goals. \nThe 20-year-old has scored seven goals in his last four starts to become the hottest property in English football and land on the wish-lists of Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona and perennial French champions Paris Saint-Germain , too. Pochettino wants Alli to behave, but without losing the edge that makes him so good (Photo: AFP) \nPochettino said of Alli: “He’s now more mature. I like a player to be like that, I think it’s important. People can see he’s smart and clever. \n“To be competitive, it’s important that people respect you. I don’t want to use a word that you twist my message afterwards! I don’t want him to be too naughty - but a little bit. \n“Yes, it is true that he is still young but he has improved a lot and learned. That is important, that (punching Yacob) was one season ago, he is a very clever and smart guy. Now he feels what happened last season and he is more mature now, he has learnt a lot. \n“His personality is like a kid and he is intelligent and clever. This clash with West Brom midfielder Yacob ended Alli's 2015-16 season early (Photo: Sky Sports) \n\"On the football side he is intelligent, too. In both sides he can learn and improve because he is still very young.” \nThere can also be no doubt about how much Alli has improved this season in terms of goal-scoring. After a slow start to the campaign, he is now on fire — his 11 goals for Tottenham are already more than his total for the whole of last season. \nPochettino admits he has pushed Alli further forward in recent games and that is paying rich rewards and the Spurs boss says the midfielder deserves all the plaudits he is getting.

He’s desperate to go to the box and to get the ball and score. \n“When we use different formations sometimes he’s more into the box than Harry (Kane) or another player like (Heung-Min) Son that are very offensive players. That is an unbelievable mentality. \n\"He can play like an offensive player and he can play like a midfielder because of his characteristics. He can run box to box, he can run 12.5 or 13km, and all those characteristics make him a very special player.
