But she later made her name nationally with the cringe-inducing details of her botched butt-surgeries––including the alleged use of chemicals such as tire fluid and bathroom caulking to enhance desperate women's posteriors. \nAlthough lawyers were ultimately unable to prove what, exactly, the 36-year-old put in her concoction, she pleaded no contest in February to a manslaughter charge, effectively taking responsibility for the death of at least one patient. The result came after a medical examiner determined that silicon in Shatarka Nuby's behind leaked to other parts of her body and led to respiratory failure . \nCheck out VICE's documentary on illegal ass injections and their dangers. \nOf course, Morris did not invent ass injections and is not even the only quack accused of killing someone with that procedure. Still, she was easily the phenomenon's most famous practitioner and her native Miami is generally regarded as the epicenter of what some call an epidemic . Like Morris herself, many of the people who receive the treatment are transgender women seeking voluptuous curves, although a Brazilian supermodel named Andressa Urach drew wider attention to the issue when pieces of her ass literally rotted in 2015. \nA judge sentenced Morris to ten years behind bars followed by five years of probation, although Nuby's family had sought a life sentence. \n\"My daughter died the most inhuman death,\" Nuby's mother said at the sentencing hearing. \"Eighteen months she suffered not knowing the full of what put in her body.\" \nFollow Allie Conti on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:09:04.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
