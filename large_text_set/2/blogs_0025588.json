The listing showed that Middle-Earth: Shadow of War would be releasing on August 22 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. At the time, there was no official word from Warner Bros. Today; the game has been officially confirmed.\nShadow of War will once again star Talion and Celebrimbor. Now known as the “Bright Lord,” they continue their quest to turn all of Mordor against the Dark Lord, Sauron. The Nemesis System from the original game returns and has been expanded upon. The game will introduce “entirely new stories of loyalty, betrayal, and revenge,” according to the press release.\nYesterday’s leaked listing said that players would “confront the full power of the Dark Lord Sauron and his Ringwraiths.” This suggests that, instead of just fighting his subordinates, Talion and Celebrimbor will get to face Sauron and his Ringwraiths directly. One of the stronger criticisms of the original game was that you never get to fight Sauron. If this part of the leak is true, it will no doubt make many gamers happy.\nMiddle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title. This means that those who purchase it digitally either on PC, Xbox One, and Project Scorpio will be able to play it on all three platforms. Coincidentally, Shadow of War is the first game announced for Project Scorpio. It will no doubt be a launch title for Microsoft’s next console when it releases this Fall. No word yet on whether or not Shadow of War will be enhanced for the PlayStation 4 Pro.\nI’m personally excited about this. Shadow of Mordor is one of my favorite games of this generation. The Nemesis System is still one of the most innovative features I’ve seen years. Like the first game, it will come out in August which means we’ll actually have something good to play during the summer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:36:39.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
