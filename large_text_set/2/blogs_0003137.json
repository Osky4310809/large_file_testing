Actress Lea Michele reveals she listens to Taylor Swift every day and now we feel like we should be best friends. We all listen to T.Swift as much as possible, and come to find out, Michele is just like us.\nAhead of the Super Bowl, Michele admitted that even more exciting than watching her team, the New England Patriots in the game, is singing in the pre-Super Bowl concert.\nThe concert put on by DirecTV in Houston on Saturday, will also feature Swift, who the former Glee star is kind of obsessed with. Really who isn’t on this level though?\n“There isn’t a day that goes by that Taylor Swift music isn’t blasted in my house,” Michele told People . “Right now, her new song with Zayn …if I play it one more time, I might combust.” It's almost Friday! \nA photo posted by Lea Michele (@leamichele) on Feb 2, 2017 at 2:09pm PST \nThe actress revealed that she isn’t the only Scream Queens star in love with the “Bad Blood” singer.\n“I Love her. I was just talking to Emma Roberts about her the other day and we were reading the inside of her booklet for Red , and she has this amazing little excerpt she wrote inside about different kinds of love,” the 30-year-old actress said.\n“She’s really an amazing songwriter and her music is just the best girl music ever,” she added.\nCan't say enough how much I love this girl. @emmaroberts ❤ \nA photo posted by Lea Michele (@leamichele) on Jan 31, 2017 at 10:07am PST \nThis is all too true of a statement…so freaking true, Lea! As for her own music, Michele is focused on her new album , Places , and we can’t wait to hear what she has in store of us.\n“[My] first record had a little bit of heaviness to it and was obviously more of a pop-heavy record,” Michele told the publication.\n“For this one, I really just kind of went back to my roots and the music I grew up listening to,” she continued. “Where I’m at in my life right now, which is in a really happy, positive and inspired place, I wanted all of that to really reflect in my music.” A photo posted by Lea Michele (@leamichele) on Jan 26, 2017 at 12:01pm PST \nNow that Michele has opened up about her Swifty love, maybe the “22” singer will return the favor? We know she has to love some of those Glee tunes , she just has to.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:34:51.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
