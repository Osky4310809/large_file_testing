Now I have completed a seven year contract as chief executive. \n\"It has been a great privilege to hold that position, once described to me by a racegoer as 'the best job in Ireland!'\" \nMatt Dempsey, chairman of the Irish National Stud, added: \"It's difficult to pay adequate tribute to John Osborne and the effect he has had on the Irish National Stud and the wider equestrian world. He has re-established the Irish National Stud as one of the premier studs in the world as well as developing its tourism offering, stud service and stud management course. \n\"In over 40 years of dealing with the Irish public service, he encapsulates all that is best in terms of capacity and integrity. We wish him every possible success in whatever future direction he takes. \n\"We also thank his wife Valerie and family for the unstinting support they gave him in what was an extremely demanding post. He has done the state and the wider thoroughbred industry an enormous service.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:07:40.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
