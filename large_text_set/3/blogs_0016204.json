What will you think about when you retire? It isn't money,\" Ferdinand said on his Facebook page. Players of today's generation will be very well paid if you're playing Premier League football. \n\"But the thing that will be at the forefront of your mind will be where are my trophies. And that is what Romelu Lukaku is thinking now. \n\"Everton are a team that are building. They are in a great position at the moment, new ownership, new money with ideas of going to a new stadium, so the future is looking bright. \n\"Does Romelu Lukaku want to wait for that future? Lukaku is stalling over contract talks at the Toffees (Photo: Getty) \n\"He wants it immediately, he wants it now. He wants to win titles and play Champions League football. \n\"I understand his desire for that. I was in a situation at Leeds. I was playing Champions League football but were we winning? Did we win the league? No. The crux of me leaving Leeds was the idea that I was going to win the Premier League. Simple as that. \n\"[Everton] don't seem to be a team that can offer him what he wants in terms of winning. Everton are a big club, but they aren't winners, they were winners in the 80s and they need to get back to that. They are building to get back to that. \n\"But there are some players who are impatient and want it now and seems Romelu Lukaku is one of them.\" poll loading Will Lukaku join Manchester United? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:43:51.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
