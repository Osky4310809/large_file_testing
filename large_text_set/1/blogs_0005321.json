January 3rd 2017 7 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ news.com.au Share \nTHE horror run of holiday drownings has continued with the death of a well-known former judge who was found unconscious in a backyard pool on Sydney’s northern beaches. \nNSW Ambulance paramedics were called to a home in Belrose about 10pm on Monday but the man, 83-year-old former Family Court judge Richard Gee, died at the scene. \nThe home where Mr Gee drowned was the target of an arson attack in 1984 where the then-judge and his family were inside asleep. They survived, but the home was completely destroyed. \nPolice said they would investigate the circumstances around the incident and prepare a report for the coroner. Mr Gee is the 18th person to have died from drowning in NSW over the holiday period, prompting authorities to warn the public to be careful around water.

Vera Peacock, 2, drowned in a pool at Macquarie Fields in Sydney’s southwest , while twins Robbi and Charli Manago, aged 23 months, were pulled from the pool of their Kellyville Ridge home on December 20. They both later died in hospital. \nAnother toddler, two-year-old Henry Tran, was fighting for his life in hospital last night after relatives discovered him motionless in the pond at a property in Fairfield. \nNSW Premier Mike Baird may be forced to launch a tough advertising campaign to try and stop the worsening drowning death toll. \nThe Baird government will discuss the huge rise in deaths at a cabinet meeting next month and would consider “all options”, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Picture: Facebook Source: Facebook \nA spokesman for Mr Baird told the Telegraph : “Any drowning death is a tragedy and this holiday season has been particularly heartbreaking.” \nRoyal Life Saving Society chief executive Justin Scarr told news.com.au on Monday th e number of deaths was three or four times higher than what they would usually expect over the Christmas and New Year period . \n“People need to understand the risks of these waterways,” he said. \nMr Scarr said the Royal Life Saving Society was deeply concerned about the number of inland water drownings. \n“Often rivers, lakes and swimming holes can look calm but there are still significant currents and debris washing through these areas. There are steep drop-offs and significant changes.” \nMichael Ilinsky, Royal Life Saving NSW spokesman, told ABC it was a disastrous summer. \n“It is definitely the season of distractions — the knock at the door, the ringing phone, other children crying out for assistance; they are the things that take our attention away from backyard swimming pools,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T04:11:05.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
