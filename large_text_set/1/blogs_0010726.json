He’s railed against corporations that plan to move jobs to Mexico or China. He’s taken credit for persuading companies, including Ford and Carrier Corporation, for keeping jobs at home. He’s been unalterably opposed to both outsourcing and big trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) because of the U.S. job losses they might engender.\nAutomation, however, does not seem to be on his mind at all. He doesn’t talk or tweet about it, nor does he complain about job losses that result from it. Yet economists, including the MIT labor economist David Autor , argue that automation is a much greater factor in manufacturing job loss than outsourcing or trade deals is. And as I and others have argued, new automation technologies are going to have similar impacts on non-manufacturing workers .\nGreg Hayes, the CEO of Carrier’s parent firm United Technologies, admitted that automation would eventually win out in the highly visible negotiation between Trump and Carrier over jobs at an Indiana plant. A few days after Trump supposedly saved 750 jobs at Carrier, Hayes revealed in a CNBC interview with Jim Cramer that: “We’re going to make a $16 million investment in that factory in Indianapolis to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive….But what that  ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs. ” (Emphasis mine.)\nPresident Obama realizes that automation is a serious problem, although his administration hasn’t done much to address it. In his farewell speech to the nation on January 10, he noted: “But the next wave of economic dislocation won’t come from overseas. It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good, middle-class jobs obsolete.”\nSo why doesn’t Trump tweet about automation? More generally, why didn’t the presidential campaigns devote more attention to the topic? And why haven’t we as a society begun to seriously address the issue of automation-based job loss?\nTrump’s lack of attention to the issue is based on good reasons and bad ones. The bad ones are more fun, so let’s start with them. Trump knows virtually nothing about technology  — other than a smartphone, he doesn’t use it much. And the industries he’s worked in — construction, real estate, hotels, and resorts — are among the least sophisticated in their use of information technology. So he’s not well equipped to understand the dynamics of automation-driven job loss.\nThe other Trump shortcoming is that the automation phenomenon is not driven by deals and negotiation. The Art of the Deal ‘s author clearly has a penchant for sparring with opponents in highly visible negotiations. But automation-related job loss is difficult to negotiate about. It’s the silent killer of human labor, eliminating job after job over a period of time. Jobs often disappear through attrition. There are no visible plant closings to respond to, no press releases by foreign rivals to counter. It’s a complex subject that doesn’t lend itself to TV sound bites or tweets.\nTo be fair, it’s not just Trump who finds this a difficult enemy to battle; other politicians don’t engage with it much either. And there are several good reasons why Trump and other politicians don’t tackle the automation issue. One is that automation usually comes with corporate investment rather than cutbacks. Note that United Technologies announced a $16 million investment in the Indiana Carrier plant. Who wants to criticize that?\nThe ultimate goal of automation technologies is increased productivity. Productivity increases are a primary factor in long-term economic growth, and U.S. productivity growth has been unimpressive over the last decade . So the economy needs more productivity growth, not less. Moreover, individual businesses usually need to improve productivity to survive over the long run. Any politician who wants to appeal to the business community would be reluctant to provoke a war against automation.\nIn addition, the work replaced by automation historically hasn’t been very fulfilling. The most structured, repetitive work has been the first thing to be automated in previous generations. This has freed humans to perform challenging and creative tasks. In some cases, as with automated kiosks, online commerce, and ATMs, it has made life more convenient for customers. A political campaign based on eliminating 24/7 access to cash, for example, would be unlikely to yield a lot of votes.\nAnother factor limiting political engagement on this issue is that it is a tough problem, with no obvious solution. I have coauthored a book about how humans can preserve their employment in a world of increasingly smart machines, so I believe there are answers — but they’re not easily summarized in a sound bite. The simple responses to the threat like “more STEM education” or “retraining for displaced workers” are not sufficient to deal with this complex problem.\nFinally, there is often faith in some quarters that the lost jobs will come back. It’s true that previous waves of automation didn’t decrease employment over the long run. Economists once had a term, the “ Luddite fallacy ,” for those who believed that advancing technology eliminated human jobs. But now many economists, including Larry Summers , are concerned that the previous pattern won’t be repeated in this round of automation. Nevertheless, no politician wants to be viewed as a Luddite. It’s yet another reason not to speak out about the threat of job loss from automation.\nSo our next president isn’t likely to engage with this issue. That’s unfortunate for the many workers in the U.S. whose jobs are likely to be eliminated during the four years of his first presidential term. Other candidates who understand technology and its impact, and who can figure how to propose solutions in clear, straightforward ways, may ensure that Trump himself will lose his job after one term.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T15:45:00.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
