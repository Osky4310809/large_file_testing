John McCain, R-Ariz., has voiced frustration with the short leash the former administration gave the military. \n“We don’t have to ask the 30-something-year-olds for permission to respond to an attack in Afghanistan,” he said. \nRep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said that while on a visit to Afghanistan during Obama’s presidency, he overheard a call from a National Security Council NSC staff member asking how much fuel was in the planes on the runway.

Alterman , the director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the administration faced a delicate calculation over how much authority to cede to the generals. \n“One extreme,” he said, is “giving 20-somethings in the White House veto power over generals in the field.” \nThat should be avoided, he said, as should tactical decisions devoid of strategy. \n“… if you’re going to target and kill someone, there needs to be some kind of process to ensure that it serves a strategic purpose. We shouldn’t be comfortable with the other extreme, essentially handing out death sentences without much deliberation,” he added. \nOne expert noted that regardless of who makes the call, Trump bears the responsibility. \n“It is reasonable for the White House to determine which decisions they need to be part of and which ones they are comfortable deferring to the Pentagon,” said Derek Chollet, an assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. “But a president has to think very carefully about this, because he may choose to delegate authority, but he cannot absolve himself of responsibility.” \nOne general hoping for more freedom is Gen. Thomas Waldhauser , who heads the United States Africa Command and wants more flexibility targeting Shabaab militants in Somalia. \n“It allows us to prosecute targets in a more rapid fashion,” he said, stating that the goal is not to increase civilian casualties. \n“The cardinal rule in these types of engagements is to not make more enemies than you already have,” Waldhauser said. “We are not going to turn Somalia into a free-fire zone.” What do you think?
