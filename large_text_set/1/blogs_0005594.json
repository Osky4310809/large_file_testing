(Photo by Mark Von Holden/Getty Images) 5410195 \nFormer CNN anchor Campbell Brown announced on Facebook Friday that she has been hired by Facebook to lead its news partnerships team. \nThe social media company has been pressured to help decipher and purge news stories that are false or unsubstantiated, even though doing so in a completely objective way will be a difficult (perhaps virtually impossible) task — especially when Brown has a history of holding an anti-conservative bias. \n“This is a different role for me, but one where I will be tapping my newsroom experience to help news organizations and journalists work more closely and more effectively with Facebook,” Brown explained on the social media platform. \nBrown is rather unabashed about her distaste for President-elect Donald Trump. Very proud of my #NeverTrump husband standing on the floor as one of New York’s Kasich delegates.

She called it a “horrifying lovefest and official Trump endorsement,” according to The Daily Mail. \nFacebook posted a job listing looking for a 20-year media veteran to becomes its “Head of News Partnerships” last month. \nBrown left CNN in 2010, citing the fact that she couldn’t quite keep up with her more sensational competitors. \n“Shedding my own journalistic skin to try to inhabit the kind of persona that might coexist in that line up is simply impossible for me. It is not who I am or who I want to be; nor is it who CNN asked me to be at any point,” Brown said in a statement at the time, according to The New York Times. \nSince her departure at the media outlet, Brown started a nonprofit, non-partisan news site focused on education called “The 74.” \nBetsy Devos, Trump’s choice for secretary of education, gives funding to Brown’s educational site, according to The Intercept. \n“Covering the news with honesty and integrity is something that matters deeply to me, and I have always felt that journalism is more than just a job,” Brown continued. “Right now we are watching a massive transformation take place in the news business – both in the way people consume news and in the way reporters disseminate news. Facebook is a major part of this transformation.” \nSend tips to [email protected] .
