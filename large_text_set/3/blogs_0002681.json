Not familiar? How about Hesketh Racing, the last of the true privateer teams in Formula 1, back in the 70s? Still doesn’t ring a bell? \nHesketh Racing, a team in the true vein of “gentlemen racers”, ran from 1972 to 1978, and gave James Hunt his start in Formula 3. In 1978, when the team folded, Lord Hesketh decided that the market needed was a true English motorcycle, in the vein of the Vincent Black Shadow. \nThis led to the production of the Hesketh V1000, back in 1982, then a reformed Hesleydon Limited with the Vampire just a year later. Which didn’t last long. As is the case with many boutique manufacturers, finances were always an issue, and production stopped shortly after. \nThe Hesketh name endured under Broom Development Engineering – Mike Broom was development engineer and test rider for the original Hesketh Motorcycles – and today produces a series of V-twin naked sports machines. Under the current stewardship of Paul Sleeman, Hesketh Motorcycles manufactures limited edition hand-built motorcycles at its works in Kingswood, Surrey, UK. \nWith the issue of the limited edition Hesketh 24 – named after James Hunt’s racing number, with only 24 examples made – Hesketh has now come up with a concept machine dubbed the Valiant SC. Based on the current model Hesketh Valiant, the SC adds a supercharger that bumps the power figure up to 210 hp. \nPower comes from an S&S “X-wedge” 2,100 cc V-twin, coupled with S&S closed-loop engine management and a Rotrex supercharger. Developed in conjunction with UK engine wizards TTS Performance, power is claimed by Hesketh to be 210 hp at 5,500 rpm, with torque rated at 295 Nm at 3,000 rpm. \nThe S&S V-twin drives a Baker six-speed gearbox, with a King Kong hydraulic clutch. and final drive is by chain. As can be presumed with a hand-built motorcycle, billet machined components abound, including the Hesketh three-piece Astralite-style 17-nch wheels. \nBraking is with Pretech callipers, a twin six-piston affair in front, and a four-pot unit grabs the rear brake. Suspension for the Valiant SC is done by Ohlins and K-Tech in the front forks, with a K-Tech Razor rear monoshock. \nWet weight for the Hesketh Valiant SC is claimed to 239 kg, due in part to the twin-cradle chrome-moly steel frame, while oil is carried in the aluminium extruded box section swing arm with integral 4.5-litre oil tank. Rizoma supplies some of the fit-out kit, along with various other components by Magura, Smiths, Domino and Moto Gadget. \nDelivery for the Valiant SC is expected to be in the summer of 2018, and orders are being taken now. The Hesketh Valiant SC is priced at around 50,000 pounds sterling (RM272,000), ex-works. darker one just for bottom of tank and where you might need increeesed black Related Cars for Sale on", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:28:47.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
