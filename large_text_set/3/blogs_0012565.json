He missed all three while dealing with a shoulder injury late in the 2015 season. \nCondo has been selected to two Pro Bowls during his time with the Raiders and is tied for 18th in team history with 157 games played. A full 16-game slate in 2016 would move him into a tie for 15th with Don Mosebar and Pete Banaszak.
