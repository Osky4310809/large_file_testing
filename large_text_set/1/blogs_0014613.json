Well, two timely topics, depending on how you look at it. \nToday is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, so to honor him, she tweeted this: Thinking of Dr. King and great leaders like @repjohnlewis who carry on his legacy. May their example be our call to action. -mo \n— The First Lady (@FLOTUS) January 16, 2017 \nSee that shoutout to John Lewis , though? That’s not just a quick nod to another Civil Rights hero. \nThe representative from Georgia was disparaged by President-elect Donald Trump after he said that Trump can’t be a legitimate president if Russia interfered with the election. He claimed that Lewis is “all talk” and no action, which Georgians and Amazon customers , among many others, immediately contested. \nFLOTUS, too, it seems, stands with the representative, who has been fighting for civil rights for decades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:57:12.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
