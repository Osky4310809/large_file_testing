I love all the unique levels and how diverse it is and all the different levels and adding memories for people that want to go the extra mile. My only downside was that I got near the end and was getting quite excited to see both of them reunite themselves but when I got to the last level I realized that the game isn't over yet. Which is good but bad because I want to finish the game and not keep waiting for the next levels like a weekly tv show (hate those). But it does add a little mystery and yen to find out what's gonna happen next. But in conclusion this game is fabulous and can't wait to finish the game. Good job guys #EndInAppPurchases Love it to bits! by Mila Audet At first the game was super easy and I was like oh no I didn't just pay for this did I? Each level gets more and more complex and harder. They are so creative and each one is so different. I really liked the one that looks like a comic book. I also really enjoy all the subtle references. I am so happy to see that people are still making real games for the iPad and not those stupid pay to play games. I'm so sick of those! This is one one the best games to have come out for a while! I hope you guys continue to make updates and also more games. Thank you!!! Lovable and Enjoyable Game by HemmoPenguin It was the right choice to download this game! Its amazing I tell you I really don't regret it. Love the puzzles and the humor that it has. I see that it has some reference to other game characters, love that! All the quest that he goes true for the love of his life and the different characters every time theres something new that it doesn't get boring. Its a really special game!I have to say it has a few glitches here and there but thats all! I recommend it!
