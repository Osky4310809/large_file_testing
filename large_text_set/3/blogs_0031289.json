Research shows that people spend almost 47% of their waking hours thinking about something other than what theyâ€™re doing, which impairs their creativity, performance, and well-being .\nWe developed this assessment, in collaboration with Accenture, to help you understand how mindful you are, both at work and in general. It is based on our work at Potential Project conducting mindfulness training for thousands of individuals in organizations around the globe. We will provide you with a rating of your mindfulness and recommendations for improving it.\nFor each of the questions below, think about your behaviors and thoughts at work and indicate your level of agreement. Please answer honestly and carefully. There are no right or wrong answers.\n<>\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:15:51.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
