The station is also receiving a software update for its navigation and control systems. \nDragon is set to deliver new research gear for a variety of experiments exploring the benefits and risks of living in space. The crew began setting up the station today for a pair of those studies that will explore life science. \nCosmonaut Andrey Borisenko began installing habitats to house rodents for an exploration into bone and tissue loss caused by microgravity.   set up new gear in the Microgravity Science Glovebox to cultivate human stem cells for evaluating their use in treating disease. \nNew software has been uplinked to the station to update its Guidance, Navigation and Control systems and its Command and Control systems. The updates will improve communications with spacecraft approaching the station and add new computer connectivity with docked vehicles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:18:01.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
