HBO ’s stated plan is for the Game of Thrones Season 7 to be the penultimate season of the hit fantasy series, and yet HBO hasn’t officially renewed Game of Thrones for an eighth season. \n“ The only thing we’re working out is how many episodes they want to do,” Casey Bloys, HBO’s president of programming, tells TVLine . Showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss previously stated that the final season of Game of Thrones would be just six episodes long, but the episode count has apparently not been finalized. \nHBO has been open about wanting to keep Game of Thrones going for as long as possible. Bloys echoed that sentiment by adding that he “hopes” Benoff and Weiss will go for more than the proposed six episodes. \n“ They’re still figuring it out because I think they’re trying to get a shape of the season,” he continues. “They always do what they think [will yield] the best version of the show. It’s all about how many they’re comfortable [with]. But I’ll always take more.” \nBut Bloys says there is no reason to be concerned about HBO canceling the series early. “If you’re afraid we’re not going to do an eighth season, I assure you we’re going to.” \nMORE NEWS: Oona Chaplin Speaks Out About The Game Of Thrones's Nudity And Porn / Iain Glen Explains Why Game Of Thrones Season 7 Is Taking So Long To Make / Game of Thrones Spinoff Plans Confirmed by HBO Boss / Major Character Is Back In Game Of Thrones Set Photos / Game Of Thrones Season 7 Plot Leaks Online / Game of Thrones Season 7 Rumors Hint at Family Conflict / Game Of Thrones: George R.R.
