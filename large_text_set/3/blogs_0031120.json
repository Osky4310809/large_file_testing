Article 50 triggered: What happens now? \nDriving from the city of Derry in Northern Ireland, towards the peninsula town of Buncrana in the Irish Republic, the only physical sign that you are travelling from one country into another is the changing of the speed signals from miles to kilometres. \nMothers take their children to and from school, employees travel to work, friends meet for lunch, couples do their weekly shopping and patients attend medical appointments. \n\"I live just a few miles away in Derry and cross the border here for my shopping in Buncrana as it is cheaper,\" says Charles Murray, a Remain voter. \n\"This is a fluid border and I am very concerned about the damage Brexit will do to this area. \n\"Any sort of border will change the trade, it will damage it. I voted to remain because I believe the freedom of movement is very important,\" he adds.
