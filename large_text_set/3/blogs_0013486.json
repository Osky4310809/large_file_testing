(Facebook) \nJust a day after Deputy Inspector General of Karnataka, IPS officer D Roopa made public post criticising BJP MP Pratap Simha’s claims, Facebook removed the post. On realising the removal of her post, Roopa put up another status on status exclaiming the ridiculousness of the act by Facebook. She said that Facebook’s removal of her post countering MP Pratap Simha’s views was not fair. The post had spoken about the claims made by the MP who had stated that the IPS officers of the state were leaving as they were not provided with posts of their liking. Roopa had made a 650 words post which had been titled “Why the views of honourable MP Pratap Simha are so very wrong and dangerous”. Later today, she made another post following the deletion of another one. \nRoopa’s post was in reply to MP Pratap Simha’s Facebook post which had stated that IPS officer Madhukar Shetty had gone requesting to the Central government since he had not been given a good post in the state. He had further named Sonia Narang (DIG-CID), Labhu Ram (Bengaluru DCP-North) and Kaushalendra Kumar (DCP -CCB); all IPS officers as people who had gone knocking at the centre’s door. Roopa D Moudgil had criticised his claim and asked him not to politicise bureaucracy and let them do their jobs. \nMP Pratap Simha is the same person who had criticised Gurmehar Kaur over her video and compared her to Dawood Ibrahim. Roopa Moudgil further criticised Simha saying that his claims that Madhukar Shetty had left the state as no good posting was given to him, was his own imagination speaking. She had added that there was no such good or bad posts as per the constitution. She had also said that Shetty had never been posted in a “good post” even during the previous government.
