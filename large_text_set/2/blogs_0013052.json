Just yesterday, Apple joined the Wireless Power Consortium, which pretty much confirmed the next-gen iPhones will support wireless charging. Now a new leak has revealed some details regarding the design of the rumoured iPhone 7s and iPhone 8. \nAccording to Taiwanese website DigiTimes , the upcoming Apple iPhone 8 will feature glass casing reinforced by a stainless steel frame. The report, citing sources from the supply chain, suggests that the 5.8-inch model will sport an OLED display, which will result in an estimated cost upwards of $1,000, roughly Rs 66,930. \nThe report goes on to say that the 4.7-inch iPhone, allegedly dubbed the iPhone 7s, will continue using an aluminium-alloy chassis. The 5.8-inch iPhone 8’s metal and glass chassis will be provided by Foxconn Technology and US-based Jabil Circuit, while the aluminium-alloy chassis will be supplied by Catcher Technology. \nThe Cupertino giant is expected to start producing the new iPhones next quarter, so we have plenty of time for the rumour mill to reveal more details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:58:06.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
