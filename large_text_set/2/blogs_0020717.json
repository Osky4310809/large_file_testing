The film has managed to earn just Rs 6.07 crore on day one, which is disappointing to say the least. While we had revealed to you how the movie had recorded a disastrous occupancy of just 10-15 per cent on day 1, we can now confirm that it has also had a poor start in terms of collections. While talking about the collections, trade analyst Taran Adarsh emphasised on the fact that Rangoon needs to grow over the first weekend to sustain at the box office. As he tweeted, “#Rangoon has a dismal start… Fri ₹ 6.07 cr. India biz… Will need to show massive growth on Sat + Sun to sustain and survive.” \nIn fact, Rangoon was one of the most interesting films of the year with a great star-studded cast. However, looks like lady luck hasn’t been kind to the movie. The average buzz and mixed reviews might have hindered the start, but there is still some hope. With people starting to talk about the fantastic performances delivered by Shahid, Kangana and Saif, a decent word of mouth publicity might develop and help the film grow over the weekend.

Speaking to us exclusively, he had mentioned, “ Rangoon has got a slow start, but these kind of movies pick up later. Generally these kind of films pick up more in the evening shows and I guess Rangoon can make anywhere above Rs 6 crore on day one. But then, it can always increase because of the evening shows.” ALSO READ – 5 films that crossed my mind while watching Shahid Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut’s Rangoon \nFor those of you who don’t know, Rangoon is a period drama. A love triangle brews between a soldier (Shahid), a stage performer (Kangana) and a shrewd business ( Saif ) in a backdrop of World War II and the Indian Independence movement. So expect a lot of action, drama and suspense when you go in to watch the movie.
