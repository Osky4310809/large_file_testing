That’s not funny. I’m not going to give you that.” \nPesca lamely offered, “She’s ready to pounce?” in a second bid at humor, but an unimpressed Ruhle simply maintained, “Not funny, not funny.”   \nThis MSNBC guest pundit Mike Pesca, who serves as host of the daily podcast for the left-leaning Slate, thought he would join in on the media’s dogpile of Conway by making a lame joke referencing the “ fake news ” that she had been “sidelined” by the administration for speaking out of turn, but the host simply would not have it. \nRuhle, remember, is so antagonistic toward Trump that she once claimed falsely on the air that Fox News was throwing its Christmas party at Trump’s hotel in Washington to try to discredit both Trump and her rival network. But even she was offended at the anti-Conway sentiment coming from her guest. \nIt would be interesting to see the rest of the media being as protective of a woman being attacked for succeeding in her chosen field. \nCan you imagine the left’s reaction if the conservative media had attempted to make similar jokes if one of the prominent females in former President Barack Obama’s administration, such as Valerie Jarret or Jen Pskai, had been captured in a similar picture?
