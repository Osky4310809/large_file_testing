It is motivated by the need to negotiate a better deal for the ordinary Nigerian. \n” I therefore announce the cancellation of the planned protest. \n“We would share further information in due course. We appreciate the massive support . \n“I am convinced our voices have been heard. \nMay God bless you all, may God bless Nigeria.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T13:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:22:54.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
