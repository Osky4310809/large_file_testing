He and another teenager reportedly stole a women’s car while threatening her with a pellet gun at a Walgreen’s. \nPolice said not long after that, the teens approached a 23-year-old man sitting in his car on the side of the road. They threatened to kill him if he didn’t get out of the vehicle. After he got out, the thieves took his cell phone and attempted to drive away. \nHowever, the manual transmission stumped Wayne, who was in the driver’s seat. According to The Associated Press , he forced the car’s owner to explain how to drive the car at gunpoint. This plan did not go very well, as it’s probably difficult to explain how to drive a standard when being held at gunpoint.   \nThe teens fled the scene with the man’s cell phone, which led the police straight to Wayne. \nPolice records say authorities tracked the pair to at the public transportation station, where they promptly arrested them. \nWayne was being held in the city jail on a $100,000 bond and was scheduled to appear in court Monday. \nHopefully, these two learned a lesson and will turn from a life of crime .
