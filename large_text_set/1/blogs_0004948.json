If you are not familiar with the strobe cream by MAC , strobe cream is a multi-purpose product which can be used as a moisturiser for face or under the foundation as a primer or just on the high points of the face as a highlighter. There are 5 shades in their collection now\n1. Silverlite.\n2. Goldlite.\n3. Peachlite.\n4. Redlite.\n5. Pink light (original)\n\nPrice: 2700 INR \nProduct Description: \nThe ultimate quick fix for skin now in shades of pink (original), peach, silver, red and gold. Super-powered with potent botanicals, it boosts the look of dull, flat or tired-looking skin with nutritious vitamins and a mega-dose of green tea . Brightens and clarifies with iridescent particles and antioxidants. Adds the softest glow to skin in sunlight to spotlight.\n\nMy Experience with MAC Strobe Cream – Peachlite: \nPackaging: The strobe cream comes housed in a white squeezy tube with a matte black twist up cap. The name of the brand and product is printed on the front and the shade name and details are printed on the back. \n\nTexture: I absolutely love this stuff. They can be used as a moisturiser to brighten up the complexion and to boost dull looking skin. These can be used underneath the foundation as a primer and on high points of the face as a very natural highlighter. The shade peachlite has a peachy pink sheen to it and will look very pretty on fair to medium skin tones. \n\nThe texture of the strobe cream is like a lotion and feels non-sticky on the skin. Peachlite has a very fine peachy pink shimmers which do not sit into the pores and just adds a beautiful glow to the dull complexion. The original strobe cream had a thicker consistency than these but, these are lightweight and thinner in consistency than the regular strobe cream. \n\nI absolutely love the fact that this cream is a multi-purpose product. The cream spreads like butter on the skin and feels very lightweight on; these add an instant glow to the face without making you look like a disco ball. These can definitely be worn alone and as a daily highlighter when you just want a little bit of brightness. These do not clog pores or cause acne. When I apply the strobe cream before makeup, I feel that my foundation goes on smoother and sits better even without a primer. This does increase the wear time of the foundation by 2 to 3 hours but, not more. \n\nPros of MAC Strobe Cream – Peachlite: More shades to choose from. Multi-purpose product. Can be used alone or under foundation. Feels lightweight. Creates a beautiful base for makeup. Increases the wear time of the foundation . Adds an instant glow. Doesn’t clog pores or cause acne. Gives a very natural glow. Cons of MAC Strobe Cream – Peachlite: None.
