Photo by Marco Rosi/Getty Images On this episode of using Chelsea as leverage in new contract negotiations... Since his arrival at Lazio from Anderlecht in July 2013, Argentinian midfielder Lucas Biglia has been a player of utmost importance to the Biancocelesti . Therefore, it should be no surprise that he might be one of our transfer targets given Chelsea's rumoured plans to basically buy all of Lazio's squad next summer. According to Italian newspaper Il Messaggero (via Italian Football Daily ), Chelsea are set to make an attempt for Biglia if the 30-year-old does not reach an agreement with his club regarding a new contract. His current deal expires in June 2018, and his agent Enzo Montepaone is in Rome to discuss a potential new deal. However there have been disagreements over the terms of Biglia's new contract. The midfielder wants €3 million per year in net wages, while the club are only willing to offer €2.5 million. To add insult to financial injury, Biglia is also interested in moving to a bigger club. Previously on ... using Chelsea as leverage in new contract negotiations... Chelsea are also supposedly interested in Biglia's teammates Felipe Anderson and Stefan de Vrij . The latter is in a similar predicament regarding his contract with Lazio, but the club are readying themselves to enter new negotiations with him. It is perhaps a side effect of having an Italian coach to be linked with just about every decent player in Serie A, but either of De Vrij, Anderson and even Biglia himself could do a decent job at Chelsea if we identify some need they could fill. De Vrij especially could be a useful addition in defense.
