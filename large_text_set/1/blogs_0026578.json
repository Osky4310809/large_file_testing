Who is spending that much time in dark places to justify its own easily accessible setting for this feature? I have my watch always on silent and I get haptic feedback all day, every day. When exactly was it ever an issue to have the screen light up, turning the situation into an inconvenient moment? Even in a theatre/cinema, it is not like my watch will light up the entire room.

As a weekly theatre-goer, you'd be surprised how annoying even a little bit of light can be. This is a good feature. Not an \"OMG I have to upgrade immediately\" type of feature, but a good one anyway. Rating: 2 Votes 13 minutes ago at 01:43 pm Seems like a widely-deployed solution to a very small problem.

Rating: 1 Votes unashamedgeek 12 minutes ago at 01:44 pm Can you turn the digital crown to slowly turn the screen on in this mode? For example, currently if my watch face is off, I can turn the digital crown and the screen will turn on, but dimly and will get brighter as I turn it. It'd be nice to be able to just turn the dial enough to where I can see the time.
