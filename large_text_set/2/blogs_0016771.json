It can easily taper any kind of straight-leg jean. To make this slimming cuff, pinch the excess fabric (one to two inches) of your jeans away from the side of your leg. Fold the excess fabric back against the ankle, then cuff normally, keeping the pinched fabric pinned as you smooth around the rest of the cuff. \nPair the pin roll with standout kicks, as this detail allows complete footwear visibility. 2. Selvedge denim calls for a single or double cuff A post shared by @ipasun on Feb 20, 2017 at 6:08pm PST \nYou dropped dollars on that selvedge denim (re: crafted with an edge right out of the loom its made on), so you might as well show off a little of that telltale red tape. \nCreate a classic single cuff by flipping up your fabric (about an inch or inch-and-a-half) from the bottom of your jeans. If you want a cleaner look while sticking to the single cuff, tuck the tip of the hem (just a few centimeters) back behind the single fold. \nFor the double cuff, simply flip the hemline up twice—about an inch or so both times. The double cuff works best with light to mid-weight selvedge denims. If you’re a smaller guy, steer clear from this leg-shortening style altogether. \nKeep in mind, heavier cuffs pair best with heavier footwear —think boots or thick-soled shoes. Stick with lighter sneakers when sporting smaller cuffs. 3. Don’t Overdo It A post shared by Men's Health Style (@menshealthstyle) on Dec 28, 2016 at 5:34am PST \nThough a couple cuffs can help adjust a too-big size and polish up a look, rolling too many times can create an awkward, unflattering shape. A good rule of thumb: Don’t roll more than twice. It may be necessary to head to a professional tailor to get that perfect fit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:02:14.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
