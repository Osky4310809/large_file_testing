Branzino for two is carved tableside, and a new lobster guacamole is also mixed in the dining room. Fan favorites and classic dishes from Fulton’s Crab House remain, such as Lobster Corn Dogs and crab legs. \nCocktails are inspired by classic turn-of-the-century American cocktails, and an expansive wine list includes both Old and New World wines. \nPaddlefish will be open daily for lunch and dinner, as well as Sunday brunch. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T02:21:20.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
