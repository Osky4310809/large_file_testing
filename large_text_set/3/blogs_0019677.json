SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \n“It is not an attack on free speech or the silencing of controversial ideas or criticism, but a recognition that the right to freedom of expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities,” Al Hussein said in a statement. \n“Words of fear and loathing can, and do, have real consequences,” Zeid said. \nIn his statement, Zeid said that U.N. member states “do not have any excuse to allow racism and xenophobia to fester.” \nStates “have the legal obligation to prohibit and eliminate racial discrimination, to guarantee the right of everyone, no matter their race, color, national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law.” \n“At the Summit for Refugees and Migrants in September 2016, U.N. member states adopted a declaration strongly condemning acts and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,” the press release said. “The Summit also sparked the UN’s Together initiative to change negative perceptions and attitudes aimed at refugees and migrants .” \nThe press release said this year’s theme is “ending racial profiling and incitement to hatred, including as it relates to people’s attitudes and actions towards migration.” \nIrina Bokova, director-general of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), also weighed in on the U.N.’s Facebook page. \n“Racial discrimination is a poison that diminishes individuals and societies, perpetuates inequality and feeds anger, bitterness and violence,” Bokova said. “The fight against racism and all forms of discrimination is a mainstay of peace and social cohesion, especially in our increasingly diverse societies. \n“On the occasion of International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, UNESCO calls on all its Member States and partners to step up their efforts to build a more inclusive, more giving and fairer world,” Bokova said. \nBokova cited treatment of refugees in her remarks. \n“In partnership with the Marianna V. Vardinoyannis Foundation and the European Coalition of Cities against Racism, UNESCO has in particular launched the initiative ‘Welcoming cities for refugees,’ with a view to supporting local authorities in their reception policies.” Read More Stories About: \nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.
