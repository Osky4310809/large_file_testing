Car enthusiasts are at odds with the realities of car ownership. Vehicles cost a lot to own, so it’s hard to own a lot of them. But if you only have one, your driving experiences will always be compromised. Don’t worry, I think I can make you the ultimate five-car fleet for less than the price of a new Ford F-150.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nTo aspiring vehicle collectors trying to get the most machinery for your money- look at your fleet like a pyramid.\nYou need a strong and steady base, with distinctive building blocks that complement each other. Without getting too specific on which cars you should buy, because picking them yourself is the fun part, here’s how I think a truly “complete” but simple and affordable car collection could be comprised.\nAdvertisement \n\n1. A daily driver and light adventure vehicle \n\nA non-terrible regular-ass car. Assuming you actually need a car for personal ambulation, start with something that’s comfortable and versatile. A car that gets you around without putting you to sleep, and is trustworthy enough to get you across a few state lines for ski trips or visits to relatives. The value of owning a car that “just works” is immeasurably stress-relieving when you’re throwing wrenches and weeks of your life at whatever other irrational beater buggies you end up with.\n\nThis is the central concept behind new things like the Mazda CX-5 and Jeep Renegade. But you don’t want to mess with monthly payments, you’re going to need that cash for the rest of your flotilla. Lucky for you Craigslist is chock full of Subarus, Mazda3s, old Hondas, third-generation Toyota 4Runner and Jeep Cherokee XJ you could drive cheaply and still enjoy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:32:45.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
