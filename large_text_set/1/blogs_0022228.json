Following the commander-in-chief’s inauguration on Friday (Jan. 20), the relatively low-profile singer/songwriter took to Tumblr and called the event “dry.” \n“I’M REALLY EXCITED FOR THESE INAUGURATION CROWD NUMBERS TO COME IN,” Ocean began. “Don’t cook the books either Donald. We all know your event was dry. No matter how many times CNN anchors repeat majestic or peaceful transition of power. The world can see America divided and the chaos in the streets.” \nThe Blonde singer also entertained the thought of former Prez Barack Obama splitting during Trump’s speech. “Barack we love you but it would’ve been equally presidential if you would’ve just walked on out while Donald got through that struggle speech trashing your career.” \n“The majority knows man, we know you did good. We see it,” he continued. “The majority sees Donald for who he is too. He ain’t slick. And it’s too bad the majority doesn’t count. In any event, a first family that I can relate to will be missed. Really though.” \nOcean notched the third largest debut in 2016 behind Beyonce’s Lemonade and Drake’s Views with his album Blonde , which hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 last August following a mysterious rollout that included the release of the visual set Endless. \nFollowing the inauguration, Trump reported that 1.5 million attended his inauguration, described by his press secretary Sean Spicer as “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration,” though photos of the event comparing this year’s attendance to the 2013 turnout for Barack Obama’s second inauguration imply otherwise. Spicer also called out the media in his first news conference, saying, “These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.” TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:49:45.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
