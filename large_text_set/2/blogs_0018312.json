I didn’t really see him that well but he was there and he buried it. It was all him.” \nSaid Marriotts Ridge coach Armando DiFerdinando: “Jack is just one of the smartest players I’ve had the opportunity in 10 years of coaching at Marriotts Ridge on the ice. I hate to talk about one kid, but he is fun to watch. He understands there are different speeds to the game of hockey.” \nNeither team could find the net the rest of the way as both defenses stepped up their game. The Gladiators (10-5) couldn’t capitalize on any of their four power-play chances, and Ross played another solid game in goal for the Mustangs (15-0). It’s the third time this season Marriotts Ridge has beaten Glenelg. \n“Glenelg, I can’t give them enough praise,” DiFerdinando said. “To beat a good team like that three times in a year is damn tough.” \nGladiators coach Chip Harrison was happy with how his team played overall. He added that his team has had strong third periods all season, including a three-goal final period in an 8-7 comeback victory over Wootton in the opening round of the playoffs on Feb. 16, but the puck simply didn’t bounce their way on Tuesday. \n“I thought we put a lot of pressure on them,” Harrison said. “We thought they were getting tired at the end. The puck just wouldn’t go in the net and their goalie played really well.” \nMarriotts Ridge, which beat Bethesda-Chevy Chase, 5-4, in the opening round, will Walt Whitman or South River on Thursday. \nMarriotts Ridge — 2, Glenelg — 1 \nScoring summary \nMR: Jack Watson, unassisted — 1:55 \nG: Kevin Lyons, unassisted — 4:00 \nMR: Trent Barrett, assisted by Jack Watson and David Stephens — 6:33 \nSaves", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:02:16.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
