Once enrolled for Aadhaar, the beneficiary can apply for free LPG connection by providing the enrolment ID slip or a copy of such a request. \nSuch application will have to be accompanied by one of the government identification documents like bank passbook with photograph, election voter ID, ration card, permanent account number (PAN), passport, driving licence, kisan photo passbook or a certificate of identity having a photo issued by a gazetted officer on an official letterhead, it said. \nThe Ministry has asked state-owned fuel retailing firms to facilitate enrolment of beneficiaries for biometric identification number, Aadhaar. \nIn October last year, the government had made Aadhaar mandatory for availing of cooking gas (LPG) subsidies. The government currently gives 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg each at subsidised rates per household in a year. The subsidy on every cylinder is transferred in advance directly into bank accounts of individuals, who then buy the cooking fuel at market rates. \nThe Ministry notification issued on March 6 stated that the use of Aadhaar as identity document for delivery of services or benefits or subsidies simplifies the government delivery processes, brings in transparency and efficiency, and enables beneficiaries to get their entitlements directly to them in a convenient and seamless manner. “Aadhaar obviates the need for producing multiple documents to prove one’s identity,” it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T10:45:17.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
