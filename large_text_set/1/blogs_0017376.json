King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 13 hours ago 17 \nAs reported, Audioslave have reunited for their first show in over a decade, rocking the Teragram Ballroom last night in Los Angeles, CA. \nFootage from the gig was quick to surface, with clips of the boys rocking \"Cochise,\" \"Like a Stone,\" and \"Show Me How to Live.\" \nThe reason behind the band's return was a protest against Donald Trump's inauguration. Titled \"Anti-Inauguration Ball,\" the show also featured Prophets of Rage as the headlining act, as well as Vic Mensa, Jackson Browne, Jack Black, and The Los Angeles Freedom Choir. \nThe Prophets' statement reads: \"The Anti-Inaugural Ball is a celebration of resistance. Resistance to racism. Resistance to sexism. Resistance to homophobia. Resistance to bullying. Resistance to environmental devastation. Resistance to fascism. Resistance to Donald Trump. \n\"We are staring down the barrel of a dystopian nightmare unless we act NOW, unless we fight back NOW. We intend to create 'No Trump Zones' across the country; in our homes, our schools, our places of work, and our concert stages. Bad Presidents make for great music. Join us as we get loud and stand together to defend our rights, our country, and our planet.\" \nIn recent years, Tom Morello and Chris Cornell have both made statements about being open to get Audioslave back on track at some point, but also being busy with other projects. \nConsidering Tom's obligations with Prophets and Cornell's involvement with the new Soundgarden record, as well as Tim Commerford's new band Wakrat, it remains a question whether this reunion will be anything more than a one-off show. \nBack to the footage, the clips are available below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T07:35:11.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
