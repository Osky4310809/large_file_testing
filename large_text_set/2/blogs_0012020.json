But if you’re looking for a high fashion variant, then you may want to try Acne Studios .\nThe brand has recently released a pair of new boot silhouettes in the Telde and the Ugo. The Telde comes optioned in beige and black, as well as pink and black, featuring a puffy upper and seasonal tractor sole in rubber. Nubuck and patent leather then come together on the ankle boot, which also notes a six-eye lacing system.\nThe Ugo, on the other hand, arrives in khaki green and all-black, constructed from calf leather and cotton. The lace-up footwear then welcomes a padded back and rubber tractor sole.\nYou can purchase the Telde from Acne Studios today for $650 USD, as well as the Ugo for the same price.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:00:27.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
