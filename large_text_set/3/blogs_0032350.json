However, he has requested funds from Congress to start building the barrier. Mexican officials have said they will not pay for the wall. \nAccording to CNBC , a few Mexican companies have expressed an interest in the building project. \nAn editorial written in Desde la fe, the archdiocese’s weekly publication, said that Mexicans who would be willing to work on the wall would contribute to a “project that annihilates the good relationship in the concert of two nations that share a common border.” \nThe editorial said that “more than 500 companies” in Mexico have expressed interest in constructing the wall. \n“For them, the end justifies the means,” it says, calling the proposed wall an “affront to dignity.” \n“The wall is a monument of intimidation and silence, of xenophobic hatred,” the editorial said. “Any company with the intention to invest in the wall of the fanatic Trump would be immoral, but above all, its shareholders and owners should be considered traitors to the homeland.” \nA spokesman for the archdiocese told CNBC that the editorial represents the views of the diocese.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:10:34.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
