Months of pressure rode on her shoulders going into the Virginia 5A North region gymnastics meet, but Wrighte seemed more focused on her teammates than herself throughout the competition.\nThe returning All-Met Gymnast of the Year and reigning Virginia 5A all-around state champion still had no problem living up to the hype Wednesday night in Sterling. Wrighte captured her third consecutive all-around region title in convincing fashion.\nShe defended her title with a score of 39.25 points — more than a full point better than runner-up Jennah Chang of Stafford (37.85). Woodgrove’s River Stone (37.15) placed fourth.\nWrighte, 16, took first place in all four events: uneven bars (9.825), balance beam (9.85), floor (9.7) and vault (9.875). Her main concern, though, was ensuring that her team would advance to the state meet.\nHer scores did just that as t. The Eagles earned a second-place team finish with a score of 143.2, just behind champion Stafford (143.225).\n“Even though I was competing for myself, it’s more important to me for my team to do well because it’s not just one person that can do the team score; it’s everyone,” Wrighte said. “I just want everyone to feel like they’re part of the team and they have a say in how we do.”\nThe vault is one of the more challenging events for Wrighte. Wednesday’s move was a “front-front,” which entails a front handspring into a front tuck. What makes the vault difficult is that it requires a blind landing, Wrighte said.\nThe entire gym grew silent as she sprinted toward the platform and launched herself into the air. The crowd gave an audible sigh of disappointment when she landed her first attempt in a squat, accidentally sitting on the mat. Her second attempt, however, was nearly perfect.\n“It was really exciting because it’s not so often that you stick a vault like that,” Wrighte said. “So when you stick it, it’s like, ‘Oh my gosh.’ ”\nHer opponents applauded her landing as her team immediately absorbed her into a hug. Not one minute later, instead of continuing her celebration, Wrighte was consoling one of her teammates who didn’t execute her vault as she had hoped.\n“She had a bad meet, so I was just talking to her, just trying to calm her down before the other two events,” Wrighte said.\nLeah Trepal of Heritage advanced to the state meet in two events after scoring a 9.625 on vault and a 9.4 on floor.\nWoodgrove’s Stone (9.575 on the beam) and Riverside’s Julie Armand (9.45 on floor) also will compete at the state individual open championships Feb. 18 at Patriot.\nStafford and Freedom advanced to the state team championships Feb. 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:21:43.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
