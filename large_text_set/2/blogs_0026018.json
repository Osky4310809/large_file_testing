AFP \nLOS ANGELES, United States — Toronto Raptors star Kyle Lowry will miss the rest of the regular season because of a wrist injury, the NBA team announced on Monday. \nThe Raptors announced on Twitter that Lowry would undergo surgery on Tuesday morning on his right wrist to remove “loose bodies.” \n“Aim to return for playoffs,” the team added in its Tweet without providing further information. ADVERTISEMENT \nToronto are currently fourth in the Eastern Conference standings and on course to reach the playoffs with a 35-24 record. \nHowever the absence of Lowry is a serious injury blow for Toronto as they attempt to go one better than last season when they fell to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference finals. \nIn his 11th season in the NBA, Lowry is averaging a career-best 22.8 points per game with 6.9 assists and 4.7 rebounds.
