The main concern is always staying out of trouble with the law. The secondary concern is always players doing wild stuff like whitewater rafting. Many contracts prevent guys from skydiving and similar acts. In general, teams want their players to go to the gym, then go home and watch a Star Trek marathon on Netflix. But these are NFL players. They thrive on challenge and adrenaline. They can't just shut it off because the season is over. They need that rush, and this is one way some guys will try to get it. 6. Does Ezekiel Elliott Run Like Adrian Peterson ? Tom Pennington/Getty Images I always thought something about Elliott's running style was familiar, but I could never quite place it. Then I read a story by Jesse Borek on FanRag Sports about a Cowboys sports radio show with Dallas Morning News reporters Brandon George and Jon Machota in which they discuss how Elliott can improve dramatically as a runner and receiver from where he is now. Which is scary. The part that intrigued me most was an interview with former NFL QB Gus Frerotte in which Frerotte compares Elliott's running style to Adrian Peterson's. (Frerotte was Elliott's high school coach, and he was a teammate of Peterson's.) What made Peterson so good was his patience in finding an opening, then exploding through it at warp speed. There are maybe two or three backs today who can do that at a Pro Bowl level (Le'Veon Bell is one of them). Elliott is another. This is why the Cowboys will be a massive threat next year and beyond. Elliott's style of running fits perfectly with how that line blocks. Combine that with how the offense also has a legitimate passing game, and this is why teams have expressed fear of how Dallas could be a dynasty for the next decade. 7. Alabama Tight End O.J. Howard Is a Freak FOX Sports: PROcast @PROcast BEAST! üí™üèæüî•üò± .@TheRealOjHoward demonstrates why he's the top TE prospect in the 2017 #NFLDraft! Tag the @NFL team that should draft OJ. https://t.co/UbtCzYOLdQ 2/17/2017, 6:34:16 PM This video doesn't mean O.J. Howard is going to be a good player. It just means what he's doing is freaking incredible. That's all. That's it. Go try it. I did with a 25-pound weight and almost broke a hip. 8. A Troubled Life Continues Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images I knew Cedric Benson, the former Texas and NFL running back. Not well, but I interviewed him several times. Through the years, he's been involved in various legal entanglements. Now, he's been accused of driving while intoxicated . Benson is another example of how some players‚Äîand it's not a small number‚Äîhave found it challenging adjusting to post-NFL life. There's no need to get into other names who've had troubles, but this has been an issue for some time. The NFL has programs in place to help players deal with life after football, but it seems they are proving only partially effective. 9. Deshaun Watson Might Be Combine Star Rocky Widner/Getty Images And that isn't meant as a backhanded compliment. Stephen Hawkins of the Associated Press reports Watson will do everything at the combine, including running and throwing. I know scouts who believe Watson will have one of the best combine performances of any quarterback in recent years. We'll see. The fact (so far at least) that Watson plans on doing everything at the combine, when many star quarterbacks skip significant parts of it, will make a lot of teams happy. 10. Could DeSean Jackson Sign with Patriots? Hunter Martin/Getty Images One scout believes Jackson will end up in either New England or Dallas, with the Patriots being the more likely choice. This is just the scout's belief. The Patriots keep secrets better than the CIA, so no one really knows, but it could work. Belichick took a gamble on veteran receiving threats like Randy Moss and Chad Ochocinco in the past. My guess: He ends up in Jacksonville . Mike Freeman covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.
