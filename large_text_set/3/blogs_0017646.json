The woman told police the disturbance was verbal and became physical when she called police. She told officers Knickmeyer was in the bedroom. \nAccording to police, officers announced their presence when they entered the home. They found Knickmeyer standing next to a bed in a bedroom. They spoke to him and tried to calm the situation, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at an early-morning press conference. \nKnickmeyer reached under the bedding, and the officers ordered him to show his hands, Belmar said. He raised a semi-automatic handgun and pointed the gun at an officer. The officer then fired several times with his department handgun, striking Knickmeyer. \nKnickmeyer was pronounced dead at the scene. Officers recovered a gun in his possession. \nThe officer who shot Knickmeyer has been with the county police department for four years, authorities said. \n“It’s tragic that this type of occurrence would happen, but these officers have no other choice but to defend their lives,” Belmar said. \nThe shooting remains under investigation. Police spent much of the day at the house, taking crime-scene tape down about 6 p.m. \nKnickmeyer had worked for various police departments over the years and was a certified weapons instructor, according to his LinkedIn profile. Among those departments is Ballwin. \n“We became aware of the involvement of Clifton Knickmeyer in this morning’s incident,” said detective Scott Stephens, a Ballwin Police spokesman. “Clifton Knickmeyer’s employment with the Ballwin Police Department ended over a decade ago and he has not been involved in the organization since.” \nAccording to state records and his LinkedIn profile, Knickmeyer also started several businesses including a company called Freedom Force Security & Defense, which was described as a security consultant for homes, families and workplaces. Its website is no longer active. \nSome neighbors said that they believed Knickmeyer and the woman had been together for a few months; another said about a year. They said he was typically seen going in and out of the house wearing a white cowboy hat. \nHis Facebook page — with a cover image proclaiming the “Cowboy Code of Conduct” — includes photos of him with the woman. \nChristine Byers and Joel Currier of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report. +2 \nClifton Knickmeyer, in a photo from his LinkedIn profile.
