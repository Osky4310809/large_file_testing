The two stars began posting threatening Instagram videos directed at each other, as well as mocking tweets. Soon, Brown challenged Soulja Boy to a fight, and his offer was accepted. \nThough Soulja Boy posted a remorseful video in which he said he hoped to work with Brown, he also tweeted a message involving Brown’s infant daughter, to which Brown responded furiously in a video, saying: “We gonna set up this fight, it’s gonna be professional, you can do all of that. But one thing you gotta stop doing my nigga, I’m gonna be real with you: stop bringing my daughter into this my nigga. Stop saying shit about my fucking daughter.” \nThe fight became a reality on Thursday, when Mayweather – who is now a boxing promoter – posted an image on his Instagram plugging the fight as “Mayweather Promotions Presents … celebrity boxing live on pay-per-view”. Soulja Boy reposted the image, adding: “Signed my contract I’m leaving the fight with $1,000,000 I got the best ever my big bro @floydmayweather training me damn … March in Vegas!! On TV.” \nHe followed that with a video of him and Mayweather, with the former boxer saying, “We gotta get the money” and Soulja Boy responding: “The biggest fight of the century.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T12:18:40.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
