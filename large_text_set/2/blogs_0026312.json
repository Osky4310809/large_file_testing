The trade was first confirmed by TSN insider Bob McKenzie .\nBishop was the second biggest goaltender name on the market after veteran Marc-Andre Fleury. Rumors of Bishop being on the block have circulated all season, especially considering the Lightning had been grooming Vasilevskiy to take over for the last few seasons.\nSpeculations came to a halt, however, when Bishop was injured in December and missed three weeks. Things started to slow even before then, as both Bishop and Vasilevskiy were having bad beginnings to the season. Both have rebounded a bit since then, which has paved the way for this trade.\nAlso paving the way for his destination in L.A. is the injury that kept Jonathan Quick out for four months. Quick returned with a 32-save win on Saturday, but there’s the chance his groin injury flares up again. If they even make the playoffs, which is a question right now: the Flames and Predators are playing very well ahead of them in the wild card race. \nCernak is a defenseman drafted by Los Angeles in the second round of the 2015 NHL draft . Tampa is in need of a right-handed blueliner, and Cernak could fill that role someday. Budaj stepped in as starter during Quick’s absence, going 27-20-3.
