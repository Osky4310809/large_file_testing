And he hit back this week by claiming: “If I am really honest, a lot of people who now go to football don’t really understand the game.” \nBilic said: “He got a kick on his dead leg against Bournemouth – it’s quite painful and he needs a rest. Did he need a break anyway? \n“I spoke with him about that also. He is the captain and is doing everything for the club. He never hides on the pitch, he always wants the ball. His is exactly what a captain should be but sometimes it is too much. Sometimes he takes it home and thinks about that - not only about him but about the club.

He is not available for Saturday and after that we have an international break. I left it to him, his decision to go somewhere for a week and come back strong as he was. \n“But I have no worries about Mark. He is our captain and gives everything for the club. He will be back very soon.” \nBilic hit back at Jaap Stam’s claim that Reece Oxford was surprised by the “intensity” of training at Reading – and claimed his young defender made the wrong loan move. The teenager only made his Royals debut on Saturday after joining in January. \n“I am surprised and not happy he hasn’t played much,” said the Irons boss. “The only reason for him to leave us and go on loan was to get more games than he was getting here.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:39:13.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
