The piece allegedly questions his mental health and claims ex-wife Mariah Carey will petition for custody of their children. \nNick Cannon is condemning the National Enquirer over what he claims is a false article the tabloid is preparing to run, threatening a slander and defamation lawsuit. \nOn Tuesday (Feb. 21), Cannon shared an image of text on Instagram saying, “The National Enquirer is preparing an article reporting Nick Cannon has suffered a nervous breakdown and his erratic behavior has given ex-wife Mariah Carey little choice but to petition for custody of their children.” \nThe alleged article goes on to claim Cannon burned bridges with NBC executives on the set of America’s Got Talent , which he announced he would be leaving earlier this month. In a lengthy Facebook post, Cannon then said his departure was over a racial joke he made in a recent Showtime stand-up special that did not sit well with NBC. “I will not be silenced,” he wrote . \nThe National Enquirer piece allegedly also cites a new lawsuit reported on Monday by TMZ , wherein a man claims Cannon stole his app idea to build his own talent search app N’credible and is seeking $1.75 million in damages. \nCannon clapped back at the National Enquirer for noting his children — twins Monroe and Moroccoan, who he shares with Carey — saying, “Only Evil operates in this manner. What is the purpose? Except to exemplify pure immoral wickedness. If you report these lies expect a slander and defamation lawsuit.” \nLast week Page 6 published a story that also claimed insiders are concerned over Cannon’s health, citing his recent decision to leave ICM Partners for CAA . Cannon also shared that story to Instagram, writing, “Funny how when a man stands up for himself the media fears his mental health!” \nSee his latest Instagram post here: TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:25:54.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
