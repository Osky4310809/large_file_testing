Ashok Selvam The under-construction 150 North Riverside building, a 54-story tower off Randolph Street and the Chicago River, could become quite a dining destination. Brendan Sodikoff is bringing his Small Cheval burgers to the riverside space, so diners can nosh on a burger while watching the boats pass by. Small Cheval will be joined by Hannah’s Bretzel and Starbucks , as signage has gone up at the building site. Hannah’s should open this summer, and they’ll have a grab-and-go section, according to a spokeswoman. Sodikoff’s Hogsalt Hospitality didn’t respond to a comment request. Ashok Selvam Ashok Selvam This isn’t the first time that Hogsalt has been linked with the building. Last year, news spread that Hogsalt would be collaborating with Four Corners Tavern Group on a space inside the tower. Hogsalt has teamed with Four Corners on Federales in the West Loop and SteakBar in Old Town. Small Cheval is the younger, burger-focused sibling of Sodikoff’s Au Cheval. The first Small Cheval opened in 2015 inBucktown, though the burgers are also available at Hogsalt’s 3 Greens Market in River West and 3 Arts Cafe in the Gold Coast. The burgers share similarities with the original Au Cheval in the West Loop, but the sandwiches aren’t exactly the same, as Hogsalt brass likes to point out. The restaurants’ entrances face the south side of the building, with Small Cheval on the east side. Small Cheval gets its own rooftop deck that juts out from the rest of the tower, complete with picturesque views of the river facing southeast. For construction updates, stay with Curbed Chicago which continues to cover this massive addition to Chicago’s skyline. The building should open sometime this spring. Meanwhile, take a glimpse at more photos below. CORRECTION: Previously, this story indicated Gibsons was opening a restaurant in the same building. In fact, Gibsons is opening their new restaurant at the Riverpoint Building at 444 W. Lake St., which is across the street from 150 North Riverside.
