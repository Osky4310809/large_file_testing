Sober me typically subsists on a diet comprised of coffee and a few small, sporadic meals. \nBut once you get a few vodka sodas in my system, I transform from a petite blonde girl into a hangry real-life version of the Hulk who can basically put any dude to shame in an eating contest. Giphy \nNo really, I’m not sure whether I should be proud of my drunk eating abilities or totally disgusted with myself. \nIf you also have a tendency to go on a destructive eating rampage every time you turn up, I have some good news for you. \nIt turns out you don’t have to hold yourself accountable for the eight slices of pepperoni pizza you shamelessly inhaled after sending your ex a series of psychotic, nonsensical text messages. \nThat’s right. Science just confirmed that the insatiable food urges you always seem to get when you’re shit-faced aren’t actually your fault.

Giphy \nThe experiment was then repeated a second time, using a drug that blocked the AGRP neurons in the mice’s brains. \nThe researchers determined that the mice ate less when the neuron was blocked, therefore suggesting that AGRP neurons play a key role in alcohol-induced eating. \nSarah Cains, the co-lead author of the study, told Scientific American the results show that “if you have an increased alcohol intake, then you’re going to, as a result of that through the effect of alcohol on your brain, have an elevated level of food intake.” \nThis phenomenon explains why your drunk ass always leaves the bar feeling like a ravenous creature that hasn’t eaten in days, even though you ate dinner right before the pre-game. \nSo next time your roommates get mad at you for drunkenly eating all of their food at 3 am, just tell them it’s not your fault and blame it on the alcohol.
