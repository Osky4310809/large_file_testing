On Monday, the veteran Rockies right-hander started chemotherapy, two weeks after learning his testicular cancer had returned. \nBettis was pitching through spring training in full health after blood tests showed him apparently cancer-free last month following successful surgery on Nov. 29. But on March 10, Bettis said a new round of tests showed that his cancer was not gone. \n“Chad has handled this so gracefully and courageously,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “He’s kept such a positive frame of mind around the clubhouse.” \nBettis probably will need multiple rounds of chemotherapy. But he is aiming to pitch with the Rockies sometime this summer, Black said, perhaps by the all-star break. A timeline for his return is far from certain. Doctors need to see how he reacts to the treatment for cancer. It is possible Bettis could miss the season. \n“He’s been a pillar of strength,” Black said. “All through this, his intent is to pitch for us sometime this summer.” Related Articles March 10, 2017 Rockies pitcher Chad Bettis needs chemotherapy after cancer spreads \nOn Sunday, Bettis watched prospect pitcher Jeff Hoffman pitch against a Cubs Triple-A lineup on a backfield here. He walked the 24-year-old back to the clubhouse and coached him through some tweaks. Hoffman is in the running to replace Bettis in Colorado’s season-opening rotation. \n“It feels like I’m talking to a friend, a veteran guy who knows the ropes and has been through a lot of stuff,” Hoffman said. “He sat through and watched my whole outing and gave me his thoughts. Any time you get to have an extra set of eyes, especially a player who cares that much about what you’re doing and your success, it’s really good.” \nBettis, 27, was preparing to follow up a 2016 season in which he led Rockies pitchers in innings, with 186. He is the senior member of Colorado’s starting staff and the Rockies were hoping he would anchor a young rotation that follows with with Tyler Chatwood (26), Tyler Anderson (26) and Jon Gray (24). \nHis tumor marker blood tests continued to show Bettis healthy and cancer free several weeks into spring training. Bettis said a biopsy of his lymph nodes earlier this month showed the cancer had spread. \n“That’s the weird thing about it,” Bettis said . “We wanted to know more. And then it was like, ‘Well, crap.'” \nBettis continued to work at Colorado’s clubhouse through the Cactus League schedule on a normal routine, without pitching. He was there to help guide the rest of the pitching staff. \n“You can see why so many players gravitate to him,” Black said, “with the leadership role he’s taken on with this team.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:57:10.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
