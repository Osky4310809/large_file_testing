Critics hold the method responsible for a myriad of environmental concerns, including a massive surge of earthquakes in Oklahoma, where the risks posed by human-induced earthquakes rivals California, according to the US Geological Survey. \nFracking is an extraction process that injects a chemical cocktail into rock formations at a high enough pressure to force natural gas and oil out. The exact chemicals used are something of a mystery, but the 2015 regulation required that companies engaged in fracking report the chemicals used in the process. \nREAD MORE: FCC blocks internet privacy regulations \nThe regulation also created stricter requirements for design standards for wells, tanks and ponds that hold the waste water, which can be more damaging to the environment than crude oil. \nThe regulation was put in place by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), but overturned by Wyoming District Judge Scott Skavdahl who determined that the BLM did not have the authority from Congress to restrict the drilling practice.

Erik Milito, the American Petroleum Institute’s upstream and industry operations group director, told the Washington Post, “ We welcome the opportunity to work with the new administration to eliminate red tape and encourage investment in federal, American, oil and gas projects. ” \nEnvironmentalists are concerned for what this means for the future. Michael Saul, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, told the Post, “ Federal rules are critical because state rules in places like Oklahoma have been appallingly slow to confront air pollution, man-made earthquakes and other serious harms caused by oil companies. ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:24:11.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
