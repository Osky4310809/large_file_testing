He added, “We will stand with lawmakers who keep their promise and oppose this legislation -- and work toward a solution that reduces costs and provides Americans with the relief they need and deserve.”\nThe organizations backed by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch declared their formal opposition to the GOP health care proposal Monday.\nFor more on health care, watch Fortune’s video: \nLike other conservatives, they decried the legislation as a new entitlement program that doesn’t go far enough in repealing President Barack Obama’s health care law. Moderate Republicans, meanwhile, are concerned by projections of 24 million Americans losing coverage in a decade and higher out-of-pocket costs for many low-income and older people.\nThe Koch-backed fund is being described only as “seven figures” and will go toward political ads, direct mail and other grassroots activity.\n“We have a history of following up and holding politicians accountable, but we will also be there to support and thank the champions who stand strong and keep their promise,” Americans for Prosperity president Tim Phillips said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:56:13.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
