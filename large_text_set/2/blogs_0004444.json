Down 25 points, partly because of his pick-six late in the first half, the New England Patriots rallied for a 34-28 overtime victory against the Atlanta Falcons. \nThat circumstances of the victory are what make this commercial for Shields Health Care so incredible. \nBRADY FILMED THIS BEFORE THE GAME WITH FIVE RINGS! I AM SCREAMING pic.twitter.com/3wbowdgY6Y \n— Marina Molnar (@mkmolnar) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nThere’s also a not-so-subtle shot at Roger Goodell:\nshields\nYou see, they did not film this commercial after the game; the Shields Health Care people did it in advance, so while the Falcons were up 28-3 midway through the third quarter, there was probably a part of Brady that realized there would be a copy of this commercial living somewhere that he hoped never saw the light of day. Fans would have called this a jinx and he probably never would have sold another order of magic pajamas.\nBut this happens all the time. You have to get this stuff done in advance. But since Shields Health Care paid Brady for an ad, that means they had an alternative version ready to go. What could it have been?\n“Place your jewelry in the locker.”\n[Brady places four rings in the locker]\n“Is that all?”\n“Oh, you’re right, hold on.”\n[Brady pats his pockets and realizes he has no other jewelry]\n“Nope, that’s it. I do not have any other jewelry because I just lost the Super Bowl, as the cheating methods we used did not result in a win, so I still only have these four rings.”\nThat would’ve been classic.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:46:42.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
