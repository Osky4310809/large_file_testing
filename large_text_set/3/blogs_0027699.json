In a separate bowl, gently beat eggs and stir in milk. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir until smooth. Let the batter rest 10 minutes. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. By the tablespoonful, drop batter into pan and cook until edges begin to brown and bubbles form on the surface, about two minutes. Flip over and cook for one minute more, or until golden brown on the bottom. Repeat with remaining batter. You should have about 20-minute pancakes. Spread about one teaspoon each of nut butter and jam on 10 pancakes and top with remaining pancakes. Wrap each blini sandwich in a piece of foil for transport.

You can also sprinkle them on salads for a healthy upgrade to croutons. Each serving delivers about seven grams of dietary fiber to keep you feeling full until mealtime. Heart-Friendly: Curcumin, the phytochemical that gives curry powder its yellow hue, has been shown to improve heart health by improving the function of endothelium, the lining of blood vessels. What You'll Need 2 (14 oz) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed 2 tbsp canola oil or grapeseed oil 1 tbsp yellow curry powder ½ tsp salt ¼ tsp black pepper Directions Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Pat the chickpeas dry with a paper towel or clean kitchen towel. You want the chickpeas to be as dry as possible so they get crispy. Remove any loose skins. Place chickpeas in a large bowl and toss with oil. Add curry powder, salt, and black pepper. Toss to coat chickpeas with spice mixture. Spread chickpeas out on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until crisp and golden, about 40 minutes, stirring at least twice to even for toasting. Allow them to cool, and store in an airtight container for three days.
