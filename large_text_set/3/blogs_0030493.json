The resolution now heads to President Trump’s desk, where he’s expected to sign it.\nAccording to the FCC, customers’ “sensitive private information” includes everything from app downloads, browsing histories, precise geo-locations and even financial and medical data.\nRep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) sponsored the resolution in the House and argued the FCC rule usurped the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission.\n“Having two privacy cops on the beat will create confusion within the internet ecosystem and will end up harming consumers,” Blackburn said Tuesday. “…These broadband privacy rules are unnecessary and just another example of big government overreach.”\nVerizon, Comcast and AT&T are among Blackburn’s top political donors, fundraising records from The Center for Responsive Politcs show .\nDemocrats blasted Republicans for betraying the privacy rights of consumers.\n“Keep your mitts off on my privacy –what I consider to be private,” Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) fumed on the House floor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:22:10.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
