If you're going to go all in, let's reference Rick Barnes' three national titles, Tennessee's 73 alumni who've been inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, Kentucky's 18-game losing streak at UT's Thompson-Boling Arena and, most importantly, remind the world that the Vols have a .917 win percentage all-time against Memphis .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:33:41.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
