It turned out he wasn't a very good first date! \n\"After seeing 10-man City beat Burnley, we had our opportunity to ask Guardiola about the performance and importance of the result. \n\"The BBC reporter went first and was very polite with his questions. Guardiola, though, seemed intent on making a point about something and only answered with \"yes\" and \"no\". Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was left bemused when he was quizzed by journalists regarding Fernandinho’s red card against Burnley \n\"Forewarned, I tried to get him to expand on his points, but he was clearly intent on responding the way he did. \n\"After the interview he said it was nothing personal - and that was proved by him delivering a similar interview to a radio station shortly afterwards. \n\"He was equally as short in the press conference and gave an odd answer about nearing the end of his coaching career. He seems to be talking in riddles at the moment. \n\"But people like Guardiola measure every word and action and he clearly came out trying to portray something. Pep Guardiola tried to hype up the Man City crowd before the second half started against Burnley – but received a muted response \n\"Perhaps he was simply keen to deflect attention from his players. He admitted himself that he got his team selection wrong, while one of his senior players, Fernandinho, who was his captain on the day, picked up his third red card of the season. But no one is talking about that now - just how Guardiola was in his interview. \n\"Of course, he's been under intense pressure at Barcelona and Bayern Munich before but he is being severely scrutinised at Manchester City and maybe he was responding to that. He was even gesturing at the City fans as he made his way back to the dugout after half-time. He must feel the world is against him. \n\"It was a bizarre experience and everyone was left gobsmacked afterwards. It was an interview I was looking forward to - and one I won't forget anytime soon!\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:12:16.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
