Strange signals from billions of light-years away may have a natural cause. If they're artificial, they'd require some awesome engineering, say scientists. M. Weiss/CfA \nTelescopes in Hawaii and elsewhere have been used to try to pinpoint a source of fast radio bursts. Illustration by Danielle Futselaar \nOne of the weirdest phenomena astronomers have run across in the past decade is something called \"fast radio bursts\" -- millisecond-long flashes of radio signals that don't have an obvious source. \nPossible causes include exploding black holes, magnetars and hypothetical blitzars . Harvard scientists have now run the numbers on the most intriguing potential explanation: ginormous transmitters powering alien starships. \n\"Fast radio bursts are exceedingly bright given their short duration and origin at great distances, and we haven't identified a possible natural source with any confidence,\" theorist Avi Loeb said in a press release Thursday. Loeb works at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. \"An artificial origin is worth contemplating and checking.\" \nEarlier this year a different set of researchers announced they had traced the only known repeating FRB to a source somewhere in a distant dwarf galaxy some 3 billion light-years away. \nLoeb and co-author Manasvi Lingam have written a paper that considers what it would take to build a transmitter powerful enough to send signals strong enough to be picked up billions of light-years away. The paper has been accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal Letters . The year's wackiest 'evidence' aliens and UFOs are real (pictures) \nThe answer they come up with is pretty straightforward: It would take a lot of frickin' power. In fact, presuming such a system was relying on solar power from a nearby star, it would require covering a planet twice the size of Earth with energy collectors. They also considered if such a construction project was even viable or if it would just surely overheat. They concluded that a water-cooled energy generation or collection source twice the size of Earth was theoretically possible. \nBut this all leads to one obvious question: Why the heck would anyone build something so insane just to send signals into the great universal void? \nThe theorists considered that the purpose might not be to communicate, but to drive interstellar light sails. This is a concept that humans are working on now. Backed by Stephen Hawking and Mark Zuckerberg, Breakthrough Starshot would use the technology to send tiny nanoships on a journey to check out our nearest neighboring star system, Alpha Centauri, which could be home to an Earth-like planet called Proxima b. Proxima b, the closest Earth-like exoplanet, is real (pictures) \nLight sails work by constantly focusing an energetic beam on the sail of a ship to push it across the cosmos at high speed. If a super Earth-size transmitter were being used for this purpose, the researchers calculate it could power a starship almost like what we're used to seeing in science fiction, up to 20 times the size of the largest cruise ships on Earth.
