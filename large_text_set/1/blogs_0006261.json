Should crying babies be allowed to fly First Class? \nLet’s face it – many of us have. \nThe idea of breaking free from the shackles of employment and seeing the sights of Mother Nature are all too tempting. \nBut there’s often one thing getting in the way – money. \nSure, there are some pretty cheap flights to be had and you can can backpack on a budget but it’s not as cheap as it used to be. \nSo what if you could get paid to travel the world? The dream, no? \nWell that dream could be become a reality – if you like kids.

If this picture doesn’t fill you with fear then you should probably apply (Picture: YouTube/Five take flight) \nAlthough the itinerary isn’t set in stone, the trip will start in New York City, then take them to Iceland and Scandinavia. \nThey then plan to do Europe – including places like Poland, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Austria and France. \nThe family are going home for two weeks in December for Christmas, and you’ll have those two weeks off – they’ll even pay for your flight home. \nAfter Christmas they’re heading back out on the road to Hawaii , New Zealand and Asia . \n‘Anywhere warm basically,’ Kenzie says. \nFair enough. Fancy being roomies with these guys and getting paid for it? (Picture: Facebook/Five Take Flight) \nThey’ll be paying for your travel, food and accommodation. \nThey’ll also pay a monthly salary of $1,200-$1,500 (~£976-£1,220). \n‘It’s hard to define your exact hours because you will be living with us, but you’ll have time to yourself every day,’ explains Kenzie. \n‘And one or two days a week you’ll be able to go off on your own and have your own adventure.’ Kenzie, Porter and Beckett taking a stroll – and you could soon be the one pushing the pram (Picture: Facebook/Five Take Flight) \nUnfortunately, liking kids isn’t enough – they’re after someone with a background in teaching or early childhood development. \nPorter is in kindergarten and Beckett is in pre-school, so they want ‘structure, consistency and a fun learning environment for the kids’. \nThey also want you to be happy pitching in with cooking, cleaning, packing bags, pushing strollers and the like.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T06:22:46.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
