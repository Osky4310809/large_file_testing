This would affect the players.” Dyson Heppell and Brendon Goddard Picture: Wayne Ludbey Source: News Corp Australia \nThe Essendon supplements saga looked to have effectively ended after the suspended players — including Heppell — returned to football for the upcoming season. \nBut with the saga in the spotlight from February 2013 until the end of last year — then re-emerging at different times since — Brown said the cloud hanging over the club would have had a detrimental effect on the players. \n“There would not have been an Essendon player over the last two or three years that has put their head on the pillow at night and thought ‘Jesus I wish I played for another team,’” he said.
