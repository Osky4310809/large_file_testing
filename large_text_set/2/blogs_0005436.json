ADVERTISEMENT \nSince developing into a tropical cyclone on Friday, Bising did not intensify beyond maximum winds of 45 kilometers per hour near the center and gusts up to 55 kph. \nPagasa weather forecaster Benison Estareja said Bising will weaken further and become a low pressure area by Tuesday or Wednesday. \nOn Sunday, the cyclone’s center was about 400 km east of Surigao City in Surigao del Norte province. \nBy Monday, Bising is expected to begin to recurve away from the Mindanao landmass, pushed by a prevailing strong wind shear. \nBising is expected to head eastwards back to the Pacific and be out of the Philippine area of responsibility by early Thursday. \nMeanwhile, Pagasa warns fishermen against going out to sea in the eastern seaboards of southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao due to strong to gale force winds brought by the cyclone-enhanced northeast monsoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:07:10.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
