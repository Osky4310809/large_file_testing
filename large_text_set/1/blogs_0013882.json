[Massimiliano] Allegri is working on finding a solution, we aren't idiots or clowns. \n\"We're giving up too many chances - last season [Gianluigi] Buffon never dirtied his gloves.\" \nAllegri: Viola loss a bad setback \nPogba has made 20 appearances in the Premier League for United this season, scoring four goals in the process. \nJuventus brought in Miralem Pjanic from Roma in the summer to replace the 23-year-old and have added Tomas Rincon, from Genoa, to their midfield ranks this month.
