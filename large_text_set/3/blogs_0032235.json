I know him differently. \n“I have a contract until 2018 in London and I feel very comfortable there. We’ll talk soon and then make a decision. Mesut Ozil of Arsenal (C).

Of course, we just have a difficult time and are not satisfied with sixth place. \n“I am convinced, however, that we will catch up again soon. Let’s see what the future holds.” \nOzil came on as a second-half substitute in Germany’s 4-1 World Cup qualifying win against Azerbaijan on Sunday, after recovering from a back problem. \nThe 28-year-old missed Arsenal’s defeat to West Brom in the last Premier League game but he is in contention to play against Manchester City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:34:55.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
