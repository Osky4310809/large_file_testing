Can I get chemically castrated?\" \nAt the age of 34, Owens told his mother, Mair, he was gay. \nHe said his father, Geraint, found the revelation \"difficult at first\", but added: \"My love for him and his love for me has not changed one bit.\" \nOwen said he has received huge support for the Welsh Rugby Union and feels he has been given a \"second chance\". \nHe went on to say: \"Unless you are happy with who you are, you cannot excel and be the best you can be at whatever you are doing. You cannot enjoy life if you are not happy within yourself.\" \nOwen's full interview can be heard on Desert Island Discs at 11.15 BST on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:11:07.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
