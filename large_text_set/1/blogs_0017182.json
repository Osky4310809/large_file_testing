Jones has cemented himself as the best receiver in the game, while Butler is an emerging star at cornerback. \nWith the way the Patriots use Butler, he’s certain to be in coverage against Jones plenty in Houston. And as difficult of a task as that is, Butler had it coming. Well, sort of. \nFour years ago, he sent out this tweet, essentially asking to face Jones. Be careful what you wish for, young buck. I wanna check julio jones…lol……real talk doe.. \n— Malcolm CB Butler (@Mac_BZ) December 23, 2012 \nTwitter obviously caught wind of Butler’s tweet and reminded him of his brash statement four years ago when he was still at West Alabama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T20:51:44.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
