This will ultimately create a platform for more impactful and home-grown sustainable models and solutions to achieve the SDGs. This file photo taken on September 23, 2015 shows Nigeria’s Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo during a meeting as part of post-coup talks in Burkina Faso in Ouagadougou \nSpeaking on the initiative, AdejokeOrelope-Adefulire, Senior Special Assistant to the President on SDGs, said the PSAG would help the nation address and solve development issues sustainably. “The Public Private Partnership (PPP) for Sustainable Development marks a new dawn in the implementation of pro-poor projects and programmes in Nigeria,” she said. \nTonye Cole, Executive Director and Co-Founder Sahara Group, said the PSAG would galvanise ideas and initiatives from various stakeholders to achieve accelerated and inclusive development across the nation. “We strongly believe that the achievement of the PSAG objectives will not only improve the global SDG ranking of Nigeria, it will also improve the standard of living across the nation through the provision of sustainable solutions to basic problems,” said Cole, who represents Sahara Group on the Global PSAG board of the UNSDGF. \nThe Nigerian Private Sector Advisory Group is made up of 13 key partners who share high commitment in achieving the 17 SDGs and also have a track record of laudable milestones in the area of implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility projects. \nSome of these key partners include but are not limited to: Growing Businesses foundation (GBF), Lagos Business School (LBS), Sahara Group Limited, British American Tobacco Nigeria (BATN), Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltd.

As the work progresses, the number of organizations that make up the PSAG are expected to increase to accommodate others that are keen on contributing their quota towards achieving the SDG’s in Nigeria. \nStakeholders working under the aegis of the PSAG will collaborate on identifying areas of common interest to achieve the establishment of vibrant public-private partnerships in Nigeria. \nThe Group will work closely with the Office of the Senior Special Adviser to the President on SDGs to ensure seamless implementation of adopted development projects across the nation. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:11:00.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
