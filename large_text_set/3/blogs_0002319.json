Hunting groups rallied against the ban, calling it an “ assault on gun owners’ and sportsmans’ rights.”\nCovering the story today, The Hill quoted Zinke as saying the ban was enacted without adequate public input:\n“After reviewing the order and the process by which it was promulgated, I have determined that the order is not mandated by any existing statutory or regulatory requirement and was issued without significant communication, consultation or coordination with affected stakeholders,” Zinke wrote in his order.\nZinke also signed an order Thursday asking agencies within his purview to find ways to increase access to outdoor recreation on the lands they oversee.\n“It worries me to think about hunting and fishing becoming activities for the land-owning elite,” he said in a statement. “This package of secretarial orders will expand access for outdoor enthusiasts and also make sure the community’s voice is heard.”\nIn his confirmation hearing, Zinke made it clear that removing hurdles to hunters and anglers on federal lands would be one of his highest priorities.\nCalifornia’s Stake\n\nIt’s unclear whether a 2013 state ban on lead ammunition will be affected by Zinke’s order. California’s law phases in rules that, by 2019, will prohibit lead ammunition for hunting all birds and mammals anywhere in the state, including on federal lands.\nA spokesman f or the state Department of Fish and Wildlife said today that agency officials feel confident the state rules will not be undone by today’s federal action.\n\nThe law was spearheaded in large part to protect the threatened California condor . Scientists say their recovery has been hampered by lead poisoning, because the scavengers ingest lead bullet fragments in carcasses or entrails left behind by hunters.
