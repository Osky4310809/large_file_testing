But I'm pleased the team have backed me and stuck with me. Hopefully I've repaid their faith.\" \nHales shared a 192-run partnership with fellow centurion Joe Root, who made 101, as England scored 328 from their 50 overs. Chris Woakes and Alex Hales (right) combined to dismiss Kraigg Brathwaite \nThe game was virtually over once West Indies fell to 13-3 with only Jonathan Carter (46) offering serious resistance as the hosts were bowled out for 142 in 39.2 overs. \nMan of the series Chris Woakes (3-16) and Liam Plunkett (3-27) did most of the damage with Steven Finn taking 2-35 while Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid picked up a wicket apiece. \nEngland captain Eoin Morgan told Test Match Special: \"Joe Root and Alex Hales really capitalised on their partnership, scoring the guts of our runs on what was a really tricky wicket to bat on. I thought they put us far past a par total - it was probably more of a 250 wicket. \n\"I'm a huge fan of time off and it was forced on Alex with a broken hand. Coming back as hungry and determined as that shows the huge competition for places in the side. \n\"Sam Billings didn't do a great deal wrong but unfortunately missed out today and Alex Hales comes back in at the top of the order and produces a match-winning performance, which is really outstanding. \n\"Picking 15 players is going to be hard for the Champions Trophy. Competition for places is really strong.\" \nEngland have two ODIs against Ireland before opening their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh at The Oval on 1 June.
