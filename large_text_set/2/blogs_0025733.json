As many of you know, the Rams' third-round comp pick will go to the Titans, which completes last year's trade up to No. 1 overall. \n— Myles Simmons (@MylesASimmons) February 24, 2017 \nHere’s why this is significant news, according to the press release ( via NFL Communications ): \n“Compensatory picks may be traded this year. A rule change approved by clubs in 2015 permits compensatory draft picks to be traded beginning in 2017.” \nThe Rams lost Nick Fairley, Janoris Jenkins, Janoris and Rodney McLeod in free agency. \nOnly the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Denver Broncos, Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins received more compensatory draft picks than the Rams did.
