And keep an eye on Transfer Talk for all the latest gossip. \nLeon Bailey to Bayer Leverkusen \nDespite interest from a number of Premier League clubs, including Manchester United, Jamaica international Leon Bailey looks set to join Bayer Leverkusen this month say reports in Germany. \"He's got a lot of pace, he's technically skilled, and is someone we are looking at in the long run,\" Bayer's Roger Schmidt told the Rheinische Post. The winger was left out of Genk's squad to face KV Kortrijk on Monday and it was reported the player has a personal agreement to join Leverkusen. However, the Belgian club are still hoping to hold on to him until the summer. \nGoncalo Guedes to Paris Saint-Germain \nOn Monday, Portuguese winger Goncalo Guedes was heavily linked with a move to Manchester United. However, things have escalated quickly and ESPN FC are reporting that Paris Saint-Germain have moved to the front of the queue for the Benfica attacker. Unai Emery confirmed their interest in a news conference and director of football, Patrick Kluivert is reported to have flown to Lisbon to tie up the deal as the club look to find a back-up for Edinson Cavani. It looks like another player to fall through United's fingers. \nTim Krul to Chelsea \nBournemouth continue to pursue Asmir Begovic but Chelsea won't let the goalkeeper leave, regardless of price, until they find a replacement. The Guardian revealed on Monday that Newcastle United's Tim Krul could be a surprise signing for the Blues this month. The 28-year-old shot-stopper is on a season-long loan at Dutch side Ajax, but he has yet to make an appearance. Chelsea could be ready to step in and sign him up as Thibault Courtois's back-up, then they will allow Begovic to sign for the Cherries. \nAndrea Pinamonti to Tottenham Hotspur \nAccording to Italian outlet Calciomercato, Spurs are leading the race to sign 17-year-old Italian attacker, Andrea Pinamonti. Inter Milan are set to hand the striker a five-year-deal after he made his senior debut this season, but Mauricio Pochettino is ready to pounce. Chelsea have also been linked, with Conte a fan of the forward. Pinamonti is considered one of the brightest prospects in Serie A, but Inter could lose him to the lure of the Premier League. \nRobbie Keane to Sunderland \nNot satisfied with the move for Lescott, the Daily Express reported that Robbie Keane is also on Moyes' shopping list as he looks to turn back the clock in order to keep the Black Cats out of the relegation zone.
