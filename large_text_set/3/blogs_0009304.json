That was embarrassing. \n“I don’t think the game should have been held to be honest. \n“It just shows where we are as a football nation. \n“I hope for them (Sydney) it doesn’t become an issue.

The Roosters play Manly at Allianz the day before Sydney’s return against Melbourne City on April 1. \nAnd, more crucially, the NSW Waratahs host Super Rugby rivals the Blues the day before the May 7 grand final. “It just shows where we are as a football nation\".
