Members on both sides of the aisle have threatened to invoke the nuclear option throughout the upper chamber's long history, but it wasn't until 2013 that the threats turned into action. \nThen-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, frustrated by GOP efforts to block Obama's appointees, invoked the nuclear option for nominees to the executive branch and lower federal courts. However, the move did not apply to Supreme Court nominees or legislation. \nSome Republicans have been eager to turn the tables and hang the threat over Democrats' heads of extending the nuclear option to Gorsuch. \nCould there be a deal? \nOther senators from both parties are wary of upending one of the Senate's most powerful tools. \nRumors have swirled on Capitol Hill about a potential deal between a small group of senators to avert the crisis. Democrats would give Republicans enough votes to break a filibuster on Gorsuch, in exchange for a promise that the GOP would not use the \"nuclear option\" on the next Supreme Court nominee. \nThe basic architecture of such a deal is intriguing because it would not require buy-in from either party's leadership. It would only take three Republicans to block a rule change in the future, and eight Democrats to give the GOP cloture now, so a small \"gang\" of lawmakers could act on their own. \nLiberals are extremely worried about such a deal. More than 20 progressive groups sent a letter to Democratic senators Thursday warning, \"Anything less than a full commitment to resistance, including a filibuster of Judge Gorsuch, would be a betrayal of the communities you represent.\" \nWhat's at stake? \nInvoking the nuclear option would lower the bar for what it takes for a Supreme Court nominee to be confirmed. It would set a precedent that essentially takes an important parliamentary move off the table for the minority party — the filibuster. And the lower threshold could give presidents less of an incentive to nominate judges with views considered mainstream. \nDemocrats anticipating the change have cited the past three Supreme Court nominees to have confirmation hearings as the standard Gorsuch should be held to. \n\"If this nominee cannot earn 60 votes — a bar met by each of Obama's nominees, and George Bush's last two nominees — the answer isn't to change the rules. It's to change the nominee,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \nThe last time the minority party tried to block a Supreme Court nominee was in 2006 during Samuel Alito's nomination. However, the high chamber easily invoked cloture by a 72 to 25 vote, and Alito was confirmed with 58 votes. \nRepublicans in favor of the move argue that Reid already opened Pandora's box in 2013. \nA Politifact analysis found that Senate experts agree going nuclear on a Supreme Court nominee is significant, though not earth-shattering. It essentially widens the scope of what Reid did more than three years ago. \nThe bigger issue, though, will be if it encourages Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or future Senate leaders to use the nuclear option on legislation. Lowering the 60-vote threshold on new laws and spending bills could prove even more contentious than using it on nominees.
