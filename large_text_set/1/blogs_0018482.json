Yohji’s take on the shearling jacket was engineered with a tech jersey shell and shaggy fleece collar, instead of the usual sheepskin, while Y-3’s coaches jackets looked like they’d fly off the shelves when they drop later in the year.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T11:57:19.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
