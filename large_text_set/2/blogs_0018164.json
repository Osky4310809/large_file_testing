This week, the hottest queer dance party in Texas likely won't be on Fourth Street or in Oak Lawn, but outside Gov. Greg Abbott's window. \nMore than 350 people have signed up to \"ride the beat\" outside the governor's mansion in Austin to protest the transgender bathroom bill and other legislation activists say is harmful to LGBT Texans. \n\"We say NO to marriage equality limitations. We say NO to old men saying what we can and cannot do,\" according to the Facebook event description . \"We say NO to anti-transgender bathroom bills. We say YES to shaking our asses. We say YES to the freedoms of the body.\" \nThe so-called \" Queer Dance Freakout \" — scheduled for Thursday evening — was inspired by a similar event last month held outside Vice President Mike Pence's Washington, DC, home. Hundreds of people reportedly turned out for that event, which organizer Firas Nasr said was meant \"to send a clear message to Daddy Pence that we will not tolerate bigotry and hate in our country.\" \nFour people are listed as organizers for Thursday's event, including Ezra Edwards, aka DJ GirlFriend , who spins at LGBT-friendly spots around the capital city, and Erica Nix, a dance instructor who runs a trans- and queer-friendly studio in Austin. \nBecca Hyatt, a public defender for Travis County, said the organizers have been working with the Texas Department of Public Safety and the State Preservation Board (which protects historic sites like the governor's mansion) ahead of the event. Dan Patrick's bathroom bill: All the trouble with none of the teeth? \nSenate Bill 6 , a proposal that would undo city and school district policies protecting transgender Texans' access to bathrooms, is one of the protest's main targets, said Hyatt: \"We want to stand up for the rights of transgender people in Texas, for the LGBTQ community at large, and for queer people of color. \"We want to be seen and heard.\" \nBut Abbott will not be in Austin on Thursday to do either, spokesman John Wittman confirmed. He will be in Washington for a meeting of the Republican Governors Association.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:37:22.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
