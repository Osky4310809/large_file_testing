Pastore latches on to a loose bouncing ball 25 yards from goal and he hammers his effort towards the top corner. The Argentine is denied the opening goal by a brilliant diving stop from Chernik. 26' Verratti catches Dia with a stray foot and although he avoids a booking, he's still not happy with the referee. 24' WIDE! Cuffaut rises to meet the resulting corner from the right from Puyo, but his effort drifts well wide of the target. 23' OVER! Maouassa leads a promising break from the back and he tees up Cuffaut for a strike, but the defender sees his effort diverted over the bar by Kimpembe. 22' Nancy have been disciplined at the back and that theme continues as they pile men back to defend Kurzawa's cross, which is cleared by a solid header from Cabaco. 20' PSG have not been fluent in their passing game thus far, but surging runs from Lucas and Pastore have proved that they can score from anywhere on the pitch. 19' Pastore weaves his way into the box with quick feet as he waltzes past two Nancy defenders, but his eventual strike at goal is blocked by Cuffaut. 16' Diagne is on hand once again at the back to clear at the near post. Guedes low cross appeared to be on course to finding an unmarked Lucas in the box before the defender acted. 15' SAVE! Trapp makes an excellent save to deny Maouassa as he his left-footed strike from distance seemed destined for the top cornr until the German keeper tipped the ball over the bar. Close for the visitors. 13' Guedes does not endear himself to his team-mates as he loses possession, sending the ball out for a throw-in on the right flank. No idea who he was passing to there. 12' Slow going for the home side at the moment as they are passing the ball around the pitch, but are finding it tough to break down the Nancy backline. 10' Dia has a forward run into the right channel and he attempts to buy a free-kick off the legs of Krychowiak, but he can only kick the ball out of play himself. 8' Diagne requires treatment after his side as he appears to have hurt his groin in the incident. It was good defending, although it may have come at a cost. 7' CHANCE! Lucas makes a surge through the middle of the Nancy defensive line and he only has Chernik to beat. However, Diagne comes across with a sliding challenge which proves to be just be just enough to put the Brazilian off as the visitors' keeper saves his tame effort. 4' Kimpembe almost puts his side in trouble at the back with a short header back to Trapp. Koura tries to get there ahead of the keeper, but the German does well to react and gather on the edge of his box. 2' Guedes sends the ball into the path of Pastore with a neat backheel, but just as the Argentine shapes to shoot, Ait Bennasser dispossesses him with a fine challenge. 1' We're underway the Parc des Princes. The players are out on the pitch, so we should be underway shortly. Nancy have made four changes from their goalless draw with Toulouse. Fait Maouassa, Modou Diagne, Diallo Guidileye and Anthony Koura all come into the side. PSG rung the changes for their Coupe de France clash during the week against Niort. Kevin Trapp, Layvin Kurzawa, Serge Aurier, Thiago Silva, Marco Verratti, Lucas, Javier Pastore and Edinson Cavani all return this afternoon. Nancy subs: Coulibaly, N'Guessan, Hadji, N'Dy Assembe, Chretien, Pedretti, Busin. NANCY (4-3-3): Chernik; Cuffaut, Cabaco, Diagne, Muratori; Guidileye, Ait Bennasser, Maouassa; Dia, Koura, Puyo. PSG subs: Meunier, Matuidi, Areola, Maxwell, Lo Celso, Ben Arfa, Draxler. PSG (4-3-3: Trapp; Aurier, Thiago Silva, Kimpembe, Kurzawa; Verratti, Krychowiak, Pastore; Lucas, Cavani, Guedes. The team news has been announced and we'll start with the home side. Nancy are battling for their lives at the other end of the table and are just one point clear of the bottom three. Pablo Correa's side ended a run of four-straight defeats with a point against Toulouse last week, but they face a daunting task this afternoon. PSG have been outstanding of late in Ligue 1, winning seven out of their last nine contests to pull them within striking distance of Monaco. Their 5-1 win over Marseille last week proved that they are not going to surrender their crown without a fight. Unai Emery's men can ramp up the pressure on Monaco at the top of the table with a victory this afternoon that would take them level on points with their rivals. Good afternoon and welcome to the live commentary of the Ligue 1 clash between Paris Saint-Germain and Nancy.
