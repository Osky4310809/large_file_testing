Mumbai were ahead by 170 runs. All frontline batsmen barring skipper Aditya Tare were back in the hut. Tare did not last long either. Once again, it all came down to Nayar. Once again he had to bail his team out and help them set a target that could challenge Gujarat’s batting. There was nothing new about it, for Mumbai’s seniormost man had been there and done that a zillion times before in his career. To nobody’s surprise, Nayar executed his job to perfection one more time. \nHis 91 ensured Mumbai set Gujarat a target in excess of 300, something that had seemed a distant dream at one point. The highlight of his knock was the way he played with the tail — adding 44 and 41 runs respectively with Vishal Dabholkar (9) and Vijay Gohil (0*) for the last two wickets. He was aware of the fact that while he had to get runs, he could not afford to lose wickets either: “We lost a couple of wickets and that was a bit of a setback. At that point of time I knew that I had to take it deep. I have batted with the tail for the past two seasons now. I knew that Vishal can bat and in the first innings I got him run out. Otherwise we could have added more total on the board in the first innings.” \nFull Cricket Updates: Mumbai vs Gujarat, Ranji Trophy 2016-17 Final, Day 4 \n“This time I made a conscious effort to take most of the strike and give him one or two balls, initially, to help him get the confidence. Once he got the confidence, we were discussing which bowler he was comfortable facing. I was giving him strike to only that bowler. It was a good communication between us. Having some fight it out with you gives you the motivation to take your team through,” said Nayar, sharing his batting plan after the day’s play. \nIt was not the first time he was involved with tail-ender Dabholkar in an important partnership: “Vishal and I have had couple of such partnerships earlier also and I hold him in high regards. Last season in Baroda we put on 90 runs. I was on 25 when he came into the bat and I scored 89. We won that game as well.” \nChasing target of 312 set by his team, Gujarat were 47 without loss at stumps on Day Four, thus needing another 265 to win on the final day. The job is not yet over for Nayar, Mumbai’s ubiquitous workhorse, for he will have an important role to play with the ball on the final day. However, he is ready for the challenge: “It’s going to be a tough day. It’s a game of cricket and anything can happen. Gujarat are playing good cricket, it’s just about who comes out and shows up and who is more prepared. Tomorrow is a fresh day and we are going to fight it out. In cricket things can go either ways but I know the boys are going to give it all and make everyone in Mumbai proud.” \nWhen Nayar says his team is going to give it all, he means it. Ask his captain, and he would testify: “He [Nayar] is phenomenal. I used to think nobody is indispensable. But in terms of Abhishek, I dare not say that. His character is outstanding; the way he works for his team is phenomenal. I am so proud to have someone like him in the squad who bowls and bats his heart out for the side every time he plays.” \nNayar has worked really hard to earn this respect from his captain and his teammates. There has been no shortcut to it or secret formula; it has been sheer hard work. He has put in the hard yards during the off season, trained really hard, just to be a part of the Ranji Trophy-winning Mumbai team for the sixth time in his career. \nRanji Trophy 2016-17 Final: Gujarat start strong in pursuit of 312; end Day 4 on 47 without loss \nAn India recall may never come now for Nayar. So what keeps him going? The response was simple: “Love for the game. I love challenges, the game. Not always do you play to get something. Sometimes you just do it because you enjoy it and love it. Coming here and playing with a bunch of 21-22-year olds and feel young, it’s amazing. I compete with all of them in terms of fitness or anything.” \nAt 33, he is a perfect role model for the youngsters in the side on the fitness front. It is something he is proud of. “I am very passionate about being strong and having a good body. Every youngster that comes into the team gets to see my six-pack. Prithvi [Shaw] was telling me today that ‘I have to see your sexy body during this off-season’. So this off-season there is a motivation to show Prithvi that an old man can have a hot body. If he sees he good body I am sure he’ll get the motivation to be fit,” Nayar chuckled. \nComing to the match, whether his knock will turn out to be a match-winning one will be revealed on the final day. Having said that, there is little doubt that it was a special performance. However, The man himself, however, has other notions: “Every knock is good but it would be special only if we win the game. Otherwise it remains just a good knock.” A self-confessed cricket freak, Chinmay Jawalekar is a senior writer with Criclife and CricketCountry.
