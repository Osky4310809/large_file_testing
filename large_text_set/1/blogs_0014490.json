Aromatherapy used in combination with massage was shown to be more effective, though inhaling the scents was successful, too. \nProtect Your Brain Suffering concussions may raise your risk of Alzheimer’s , researchers from Boston University suggest. And even one single concussion can be serious. After studying MRIs of the cerebral cortex—the first part of the brain that degrades with Alzheimer’s—in war veterans who suffered at least one concussion, the researchers discovered that those with genetic predisposition to the brain disease who suffered at least one concussion showed a decline in thickness in that region, the Boston Herald reports. They also scored lower on memory tasks. \nRe-Think That Turmeric? The yellow spice turmeric, often used in curries and mustards, has gained reputation as a superfood, since researchers have suggested it may possibly work as an anti-inflammatory and protect against cancer. Now, a new review of scientific evidence concludes that turmeric actually has limited health benefits , TIME reports. There just aren’t enough high-quality scientific studies out there confirming its benefits, the researchers say. \nPop an Aspirin Daily aspirin can help protect your heart , as we previously reported. Now, there may be another benefit to a regular regimen: Aspirin can reduce your risk of pancreatic cancer , one of the most deadly types of the big C.
