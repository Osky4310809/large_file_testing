He continued later, “[Yiannopoulos] has made many controversial statements … and this one has pushed it over the line.” \nIt’s worth noting as Gasparino points out, that Breitbart has generally stood by even Milo’s most controversial statements. \n“I just know that inside Breitbart, there are people saying that there’s a good chance — there is a debate, there are people that want him to stay — but they find this thing very, very hard to defend and we’re going to see what happens,” said Gasparino. #BreakingNews : @BreitbartNews weighing dismissal of Milo Yiannopoulos announcement could come soon no comment from Milo \n— Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) February 20, 2017 scoop: Breitbart senior editor tells me at least half a dozen employees ready to walk out if Milo is not fired. pic.twitter.com/k5wZ3OGTlL \n— Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) February 20, 2017 \nDuring the election, as white nationalism and white supremacy was tired directly to the site, advertisers started walking. The decisions to fire Milo would likely be to protect the site from further damage. Don’t be fooled for a second it’s because they don’t defend Milo’s heinous words.
