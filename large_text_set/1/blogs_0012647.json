Gardaí said a female member of staff was assaulted during the robbery. \nShe received minor injuries. \nThe raiders fled the scene, in the direction on Tinahely, County Wicklow, with a small amount of cash in a grey coloured Landrover Sport, partial registration 151 D. \nIn a statement gardaí said this vehicle was being driven by a fourth man. It is believed that the raiders arrived at the post office in this vehicle and the driver remained in it outside the premises during the attack. \nA burnt out vehicle was later located at Clonegal, County Carlow. This vehicle has been seized by Gardaí for technical examination. \nGardaí are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information is asked to contact them at Gorey Garda Station on 053 9430690, The Garda Confidential Line, 1800 666111 or any Garda station.
