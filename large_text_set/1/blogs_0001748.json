He says there’s no specific plans for a release, but that one of them ended up as “Moving Backwards” on ATCQ’s 2016 album We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service . \nThe “Come Down” singer also described how he visualized himself winning the Grammy. \n“I tried to take a little time and just see it,” he says. “It became a little more clear. I just kept it in the back of my mind.” \nHe also shared plans for him and Pharrell to jump in the studio in the preview for the episode, which airs in full on Sunday (January 8) at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST. \nOh, and Pharrell and Paak also end up singing an a cappella rendition of Thundercat’s “Them Changes.” \n— Andy $ide$tick (@AndersonPaak) January 5, 2017 \nWatch a preview of Sunday’s Apple Music’s OTHERtone Beats 1 Show episode below.
