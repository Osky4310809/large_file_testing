Close share panel The numbers of people who have signed a petition calling for President Trump not to be allowed to make a state visit to the UK has been widely reported. \nCan it be believed? \nThe number reported by Parliament's petitions website is at about 1.8 million. \nThere is also a petition saying that President Trump should be welcomed with a state visit, which has passed 200,000 signatures. \nAny British citizen or UK resident is entitled to sign a petition on the site and asked to confirm their status when they do so. \nAn email is then sent to the address given, containing a link that signatories must click on before they are counted. \nThe House of Commons says: \"All petitions are checked for fraudulent activity, using both automated and manual checks. The checks prevent fraudulent signatures being added to petitions by individuals trying to repeatedly sign, or automated attacks (bots).\" \nIt adds that there is a balance to be made between making it easy for people to sign while making it harder to do so repeatedly.
