(Photo: Nike) 3 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe looks on the kids faces said it all. \nThe grins from ear-to-ear were as much about their new shoes as they were about meeting Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James. \nNike, in cooperation with James, released the LeBron Soldier 10 FlyEase on Monday. To celebrate, James invited kids from the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital for Rehabilitation and personally offered up the new shoes. \n\"Sport in general should never be taken away from any kid. It creates fun, it creates laughter, it creates competitiveness, it creates brotherhood or sisterhood,\" James said. \"To be able to have access to shoes that's very easy to get on and take off, FlyEase gives kids another opportunity to live out their dream.\" \nThe idea for the FlyEase shoes came about after then-16-year-old Matt Walzer wrote a letter to Nike CEO Mark Parker in 2012, asking for a shoe design that didn't require him to tie his shoes. Walzer, who has cerebral palsy, only has flexibility in one hand which made it impossible to tie his shoes. Monday's release was Nike's latest version. \n\"It looks just like the traditional Soldier 10 but with a far more generous opening for the foot,\" said Tobie Hatfield, Nike's Senior Director of Innovation. \"Of all the shoes we've ever made, this may be the easiest one to get into.\" \nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Michael Singer on Twitter @msinger.
