But when she found out the reason why the young man had that particular hairstyle, she and her producers were left scrambling for an apology.\n\"This year, the bow ties were gone, replaced by Nazi hair,\" a narrator explains on Bee's program, \"Full Frontal,\" while showing clips of attendees that included 20-year-old Outset Magazine writer Kyle Coddington, according to The Washington Post.\nBut Coddington and his family members quickly noticed the video and found it deeply offensive. Coddington has a particular reason for his current hairstyle.\n\"When [Samantha Bee] makes fun of your brother for having 'Nazi hair,'\" Coddington's sister, Megan Coddington, tweeted to Bee. \"He actually has stage 4 brain cancer, but whatever floats your boat.\"\n\nThe journalist was none too happy with the video, and did not find it funny.\n\"Please delete this episode,\" Coddington wrote in a series of Tweets. \"I look like a balding potato. â€¦ Also, it's not a Nazi haircut. [Neo-Nazi] Richard Spencer's is, but mine's from cancer.\"\n\nStephen Perkins, who also writes for Outset, joined in calling the piece \"offensive.\"\n\"On a personal note, as someone who has the pleasure of working with Kyle here at OUTSET, I urge Samantha Bee to release an apology for this sick attempt at a joke,\" he wrote. Perhaps labeling someone because of their appearance is not the best approach.\"\nBee's program issued an apology a short time later.\n\"We deeply apologize for offending you and [Coddington],\" the show's team Tweeted in response to Megan's comment. \"We only learned of his condition today [and] have removed him from the piece.\"\n\n\"Full Frontal\" executive producer Jo Miller said the show would donate to Coddington's GoFundMe account to help him pay for his expensive cancer treatments.\nBy March 9, the page has raised more than $9,800, far exceeding its $2,500 goal.\n\"Currently, there is no cure, but there is a chance,\" Coddington wrote on the crowdfunding page. \"The doctor said it all depends on how hard we go after it, and how my body responds to the treatment. I fully believe that God is still in the miracle-making business as well! I'm putting complete trust in God and I know regardless of the outcome, I'll be healed one way or another!\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:41:52.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
