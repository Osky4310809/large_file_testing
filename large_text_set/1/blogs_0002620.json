The CW, STX Productions When Vincent Rodriguez III read the character description for Crazy Ex-Girlfriend ’s Josh Chan, he couldn’t believe it. “‘Josh is an athletic-looking Asian bro in his late twenties.’ I’m like, first of all, who wrote this breakdown? I’ve never seen this before,” he told BuzzFeed News. “So many things about it are, I daresay, first-timers on American television . And it’s not because this person never existed. It’s just no one has thought to tell this story.” \nLater in 2016, The Edge of Seventeen featured actor Hayden Szeto as Erwin Kim, the love interest for Hailee Steinfeld’s character. “Being an Asian-American actor, you’re kind of jaded,” Szeto told BuzzFeed News . “You’re just used to a certain kind of role … you know, the best friend, the tech guy, or anything that underrepresents you as a human being.” But with Erwin, he got to be the guy who got the girl.

The subtlety of Pee-wee and Joe Manganiello’s romance in Big Holiday is not repressive so much as subversive.

Waller-Bridge’s saltiness includes plenty of gags about and scenes of sex, but it’s as part of a larger interest in intimate awkwardness — she’s a more general connoisseur of the animal indignities of the human body, the way its fleshy unpredictability is always there, often in defiance of our attempts at respectability and reserve.
