The man was asked to leave the house but he made such a hue and cry about it, that BB had to send security to escort him outside. Post his eviction, he has been making all sorts of claims to the media – the weirdest one being – Salman Khan is an ISI agent! \nAccording to a report in India Today, Om Swami claimed that Khan is antinational and is a spy for ISI. He also went on to add that the other contestants in the house wanted to kill him by poisoning his food. Umm, where would they get poison from in the first place?! Anyway, he even said that Bani was sleeping with Jason Shah in the house. \nIf this doesn’t prove how filthy this man’s mind is, I don’t know what will. Absolutely appalling. Reportedly, Salman is all set to address this issue today and we can’t wait to hear what he has to say. 23", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:05:58.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
