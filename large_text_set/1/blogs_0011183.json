His offensive line has been a sieve, forcing the quarterback to buy space with his feet. \nFacing a third-and-15 early in the fourth quarter, Wilson took off past the line of scrimmage in hopes of picking up the first down. A Falcons cornerback made sure Wilson landed WELL short of the marker.\nThat’s a helluva hit, clean and decisive. It represents what has so far been a dominant game by the Falcons over a traditionally strong postseason team.
