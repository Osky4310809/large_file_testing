On it, the 22-year-old emcee doesn’t hold back when addressing our incoming President. \n“Sorry America I will not be your soldier/ Obama just wasn’t enough, I need some more closure/ And Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over,” he raps. \n“Land of the Free” is Bada$$’ powerful state of the nation address, confronting the country’s continued legacy of oppression, claiming “the land of the free is for the free loaders,” leaving bodies “dead in the street to be their organ donors” and disorganizing the black population to make them “all loners.” \nDownload the track here and stream it below: TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T08:19:07.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
