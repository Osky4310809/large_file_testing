The contract is a six-year deal, according to Jeff Goodman of ESPN. Wade spent the past two seasons at Virginia Commonwealth, making the NCAA tournament both times as a No. 10 seed. His squad lost in the first round to Saint Mary's this year. The 34-year-old coach spent the previous two years at Chattanooga. In four seasons as a Division I head coach, he has a 91-45 career record. He will hope to turn around an LSU team that has brought in elite talent in recent years—including McDonald's All-Americans Ben Simmons and Antonio Blakeney—but hasn't been able to turn that into success on the court. The Tigers have just two NCAA tournament appearances since its Final Four in 2006. The team finished 10-21 this season and fired head coach Johnny Jones after five years. Meanwhile, VCU will have to find another coach who can keep the program on top of the conference, just as it did after Shaka Smart, Anthony Grant and Jeff Capel left for bigger programs.
