READ MORE Feb 11th 2017 10:10PM \nSEOUL, Feb 12 (Reuters) - North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast early on Sunday, South Korea's military said, the first time the isolated state has tested such a device since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. \nU.S. and South Korean military sources said the missile did not appear to be an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) given its flight range. \nTrump had been briefed on the missile launch, and the White House is continuing to monitor the situation, a White House official said on Saturday. Trump did not respond to a shouted question from a reporter about the launch as he posed for pictures with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ahead of a dinner in Florida. \nThe launch marks the first test of Trump's vow to get tough on a North Korean regime that last year tested nuclear devices and ballistic missiles at an unprecedented rate in violation of United Nations sanctions. \nThe latest test comes a day after Trump held a summit meeting with Abe and said he agreed to work to ensure a strong defense against North Korea's threat, and also follows Trump's phone call last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping. \nA U.S. official said after the test that the Trump administration would press China to do more to rein in North Korea. \nChina is North Korea's main ally but has been frustrated by Pyongyang's repeated provocations, although it bristles at pressure from Washington and Seoul to rein in the North and its young leader, Kim Jong Un. \nChina's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday morning. \nThe missile was launched from an area called Panghyon in North Korea's western region just before 8 a.m. (2300 GMT Saturday) and flew about 500 km (300 miles), the South's Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. \n\"Our assessment is that it is part of a show of force in response to the new U.S. administration's hardline position against the North,\" the office said in a statement. \nThe South's military said Seoul and Washington were analyzing the details of the launch. Yonhap News Agency said the South Korean military was assessing the launch to confirm whether it was a Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile, which has a designed range of 3,000 km (1,800 miles). 16 PHOTOS 15 facts about Kim Jong Un See Gallery 15 facts about Kim Jong Un \n1) Kim Jong Un was born on January 8 -- 1982, 1983, or 1984. \nHis parents were future North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il and his consort, Ko Young Hee.

While Jong Il was the heir apparent, Jong Un's path to command was far less certain. \n(DPRK propaganda via http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/NG14Dg02.html ) \n3) Then it was off to Switzerland to attend boarding school. \nCalled \"Pak Un\" and described as the son of an employee of the North Korean embassy, Jong Un is thought to have attended an English-language international school in GÃ¼mligen near Bern. \n4) Jong Un loved basketball and idolized Michael Jordan. \nThe young Korean reportedly had posters of Jordan all over his walls during his Swiss school days. Although Jong Un was overweight and only 5-6, he was a decent basketball player. \n(Photo by Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty Images) \n5) After school in Switzerland, he returned home for military schooling. \nUpon his return to North Korea, Jong Un attended Kim Il Sung Military University with his older brother . Some reports say they started to attend their father's military field inspections around 2007. \n(Photo by Liu Xingzhe/ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images) \n6) Jong Un has a theme song known as \"Footsteps.\" \n\"Footsteps\" looks and sounds like a propaganda song from the Soviet Union. \n7) Many North Koreans see Jong Un as a youthful version of \"Great Leader\" Kim Il Sung. \nKim bears a clear resemblance to his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, in appearance, haircut, and mannerisms. \n(Photo: Wikimedia Commons) \n8) After his father died, Jong Un was quickly declared \"Supreme Leader\" of North Korea. \n(AFP/Getty Images) \n9.

He's married to a former cheerleader and may have two kids. \n(KCNA KCNA / Reuters) \n10) But at the end of December 2013, Jong Un had his uncle and his uncle's family executed, apparently in a bid to stop a coup against his rule. \n12) Jong Un lived out a childhood fantasy when former Chicago Bulls star Dennis Rodman visited. \nEveryone in the family is apparently a huge Chicago Bulls fans. \n(Photo courtesy of VICE) \n13) But recently, things haven't been going so well. \nIn 2013 he was reportedly the target of an assassination attempt. South Korean intelligence believes the young leader was targeted by \"disgruntled people inside the North\" after he demoted a four-star general, which resulted in a power struggle. \n(Photo courtesy: DPRK) 14.
