Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports) 14 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCharles Barkley is at it again. \nJust a week after the Hall of Famer made headlines for his criticism of LeBron James , he took a jab at \"this new generation\" of NBA players, including Dwyane Wade, who came to the defense of James and said Barkley should \"shut up,\" and Draymond Green, who said Barkley should be muted because he never won an NBA championship . \n\"This new generation, they all stick together, they all play together, they're all AAU babies,\" Barkley said Wednesday on Mike & Mike when asked about the comments made by Wade and Green. \"Any type of criticism directed toward them, they consider it hate. Even if it's a fair criticism, they consider it hate. So no, it does not bother me what the new generation thinks, to be honest with you. I know they all stick together, so that's just part of it too.\" \nMORE NBA:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T19:57:33.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
