The actor became an icon with his turn as the deadly machine, and his quotes from the film are still some of the most memorable around. \nUnfortunately, it looks like Arnold won't be returning to the role again. The actor is about to turn 70, and a new report states that he's walking away from The Terminator franchise for good. \nA source close to NY Daily News reported that Arnold's finally hanging up the sawed-off and calling it quits. “It is over for The Terminator and Arnold,” the source stated. “The studio has taken the sequel off the production slate completely, meaning there is no pre-production or any plans for another sequel. The talent had been offered long term deals, but this is not happening. “The Genisys movie was seen as a way of reviving (the franchise), but the critics were not happy and somehow the studio bosses fell out of love with making more, even though they made huge profits.\" This report makes total sense, considering the critical bashing of Genisys and the age of the star. However, it goes against the latest bit of news from the Terminator front. Back in January, it was revealed that James Cameron was returning to the franchise for another movie. Along with Deadpool director Tim Miller, Cameron was reportedly going to produce a brand new addition to the Terminator saga. With all of the production delays surrounding Cameron's Avatar films, his involvement in a new Terminator film seems like a long shot. The guy is gearing up for the first of four Avatar sequels, so he's got no time to take a detour. It looks like it's Hasta La Vista for the Terminator franchise. \nMore Movie News:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:27:20.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
