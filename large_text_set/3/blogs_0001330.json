Only a small proportion of that total comes from wind, geothermal, solar, biomass and waste, but it is growing fast. Renewable energy excluding hydro accounted for 6.7% of the global total in 2015 and increased by 213 terawatt-hours. This rise was roughly equivalent to the total increase in global power generated, reflecting efforts both to promote clean power sources and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Europe accounts for two-fifths of global renewable-energy generation, and it is wind turbines that dominate the European scenery. Exposure to the prevailing weather from the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean determines which countries have giant propeller turbines as their main source of renewable energy. Germany is leading the way, with an increase of power generated from wind turbines of 53.4% in the past year. Half of Germanyâ€™s renewable energy now comes from wind. Unfortunately, because the wind often does not blow and occasionally blows too hard, these turbines are not very efficient. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in Britain calculates that wind turbines on land run at only 27.3% of their potential capacity, with turbines situated offshore returning a better 36.9%. Because the supply of wind power is so variable, electricity grids still need a back-up supply of coal, oil or gas to soak up any shortfalls until there is more storage. Fossil-fuel-powered steam turbines still only run at around 45% efficiency, but they can be fired up to meet demand. Despite fast growth in renewable energy, it will be a long time before fossil fuels are consigned to history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:19:39.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
