None of that is on the menu this time out. Sorry. \nStill, there's plenty going on. There's the third episode of the Craig Shakespeare Supremacy, for a start, with Leicester welcoming Sevilla to the King Power Stadium on Tuesday night. \nThen, on Wednesday, Monaco and Manchester City reconvene under the auspices of the unspoken defensive mutual-destruction pact that yielded such spectacular results three weeks ago. \nHere are the stories to watch: All's well that ends well? The Foxes are very much still in the tie - when they perhaps shouldn't be (Photo: REUTERS) \nFor a brief moment, it looked as though Jamie Vardy's late strike at the Sanchez Pizjuan would be enough to grant Claudio Ranieri a stay of execution at Leicester City. Results in the Premier League had been miserable, but that away goal lifted spirits and raised hopes that the Foxes were about to turn a corner at last. \nIt was not to be, of course, and now Leicester welcome Sevilla to England for the return leg with a new man in the dugout: Craig Shakespeare, the new doyen of sub-editors up and down the nation, has been given the job until the end of the season on the back of two promising games as caretaker. \nThe 53-year-old admitted that the fallout from Ranieri's exit left him feeling like a \"pantomime villain\", but home victories over Liverpool and Hull have swiftly moved the narrative on. The threat of relegation has eased. After a torrid few months, the doom and gloom has lifted again. \nGoing by the noises coming out of the Leicester camp, Shakespeare is more affable uncle than obsessive tactician.

If the rumours of a dressing-room mutiny under Ranieri were true, it should probably come as little surprise that a motivator who knows the club inside-out – he first pitched up there with Nigel Pearson in 2010 – has been able to wring an improvement from jaded players. \nThe question is whether he can maintain that beyond the short term. Certainly, his first task as full-time boss is a far more daunting one than those two Premier League assignments. The taming of the shrewd Jorge Sampaoli won't be easy, even for Shakespeare.

Sevilla's last two league games have yielded just two points, meaning their hopes of mounting an unlikely title challenge are beginning to dwindle. \nThere's no shame in being five points behind Real Madrid, of course, but the nature of Saturday's draw was troubling. Sevilla fell behind early to relegation-threatened Leganés and, despite drawing level through Stevan Jovetic just before the interval, rarely looked likely to find a winner. Jovetic has impressed since his arrival in Seville (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nLocal paper Estadio Deportivo did not pull any punches. \"There was nothing positive to cling onto,\" wrote Fernando Mateos. \"Sevilla were a bundle of nerves in a poor match.\" \nEven Sampaoli could not sugar-coat it. \"If we give this performance again, we will have a lot to worry about in the Champions League,\" he said.

Take a look at the Old Lady's recent record on their own patch. \nMax Allegri's side have not lost at Juventus Stadium since August 2015; their record over the last 40 matches at the ground reads W37 D3 L0. \nLook the 'imperious' up in the dictionary and you'll see Gigi Buffon grinning out at you. Read More Tayfun and games at Leverkusen Korkut took charge of Bayer for the first time at the weekend (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nIt wasn't the 4-2 defeat in the first leg of their tie with Atleti that did it. Nor was it the home loss to Mainz. No, it was the 6-2 shellacking at Borussia Dortmund that finally brought the curtain down Roger Schmidt's time at Bayer Leverkusen – and not before time, some would say. \nIt wasn't so long ago that Schmidt was viewed as a managerial star in the making. He made a striking impression in his early days at the BayArena, his commitment to high-energy attacking football winning him fans there and beyond. Even at the start of this season, Leverkusen looked best-placed to trouble Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table – even if just for a few months. \nBut it has been a miserable season in the main. As RB Leipzig and Hoffenheim have taken up residency in the upper echelons of the Bundesliga table, Leverkusen's campaign has been defined by defensive lapses and false promise. With 24 matches played, Die Werkself are in the bottom half of the table, with a negative goal difference. \nWhen the axe came for Schmidt, few were surprised. His replacement is former Turkey international Tayfun Korkut, who has signed on until the end of the season. It was, said sporting director Rudi Voller, \"an easy decision\" – not least because Korkut was without a club and, in all likelihood, isn't costing them an arm and a leg. \nThe new regime got off to an inauspicious start at the weekend: Leverkusen went ahead early on against struggling Werder Bremen but were pegged back by Claudio Pizarro. There could be more pain ahead in Madrid, too, if their limp display in the first leg is anything to go by. poll loading Who's going through to the Champions League quarter-finals? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:39:59.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
