Whether it’s commuting from Tooting to White City or travelling from your flat in Dalston to a party in Putney, getting around can take days away from your life.\nIn fact, sometimes it’s quicker to leave London altogether and spend the day in the countryside.\nYou don’t even need to cross the M25 to feel like you’re in a whole different world. Whether you’re into stately homes or roller coasters, you can do pretty much anything you want within an hour of leaving the city.\nScroll below to see some of the best day-trip locations less than an hour from London.\n \nClivenden House \n(Picture: Shutterstock) Culture vultures and tourists don’t always mix. If stately homes are your thing, Clivenden is a sprawling country pile two miles from the sleepy village of Taplow that’s easy to reach from central London, but not as popular as nearby Windsor Castle.\nJourney time: 40 minutes to Taplow from Paddinton Station via Great Western Railways . From there, it’s a brisk country walk (or a five-minute taxi journey) to the gardens.\nSt Albans \n(Picture: Shutterstock) St Albans is the most easily reached town outside the M25. The cathedral is stunning, the farmers market is quaint, and the pubs are ancient and inviting. What more could you want from a day out?\nJourney time: 20 minutes from St Pancras International via Thameslink services.\nWindsor Castle \n(Picture: Shutterstock) You couldn’t have a list of ways to escape London for the day and not include Windsor Castle. It may be packed with tourists throughout the year, but it’s worth it to see the oldest and largest occupied castle in the world. Who knows? You might even meet the Queen if you’re lucky.\nJourney time: 54 minutes to Windsor and Eton Riverside Station via South West Trains .\n \nGreat Missenden \n(Picture: Cultura/Getty) Great Missenden is surrounded by peaceful woodlands which make it perfect for a country walk, but it’s better known as the former home of Roald Dahl. His former home isn’t open to the public, but the chocolate-box village is filled with references to the author’s works.\nJourney time: 41 minutes from Marylebone Station via Chiltern Railways .\n \nColchester \n(Picture: Shutterstock) Before London, there was Colchester. It’s the oldest town in Britain and it’s brimming with activities, come rain or shine. If the weather is good, head to nearby Mersea Island where you can go crabbing (fishing, but with crabs), or eat the freshest seafood around at The Company Shed .\nJourney time: 46 minutes from Liverpool Street Station to Colchester via Greater Anglia . Mersea Island is a 25 minute drive from the town centre.\n \nMayfields Lavender Farm \n(Picture: Shutterstock) Mayfields Lavender Farm may not always be open, but it’s worth a visit in the summer, when the lavender fields are full bloom and the colours will look great on your Instagram profile/Facebook cover photo. Better yet, the family-run organic farm sells scented soaps, candles and body scrubs, as well as lavender infused fudge and ice cream. It’s close to Epsom, and is easily reached from South London, whether you’re driving or taking the train.\nJourney time: 47 minutes to Woodmansterne from London Bridge via Southern Rail , then it’s a short walk to the farm.\n \nHever Castle \n(Picture: Shutterstock) Stately homes were made for rainy days. Built in 1270, Hever Castle, which has beautiful landscaped gardens and a water maze, is famous for being the childhood home of Anne Boleyn.\nJourney time: 45 minutes from London Bridge to Hever via Southern Rail , followed by a 20-minute walk to the castle.\n \nCambridge \n(Picture: Shutterstock) With 31 university colleges (over half of which were built before the 16th century), punting tours and a sprawling farmers’ market on Sundays, Cambridge is one of the best places to go full tourist. The tour guides, many of whom are students at the University, never get bored of telling people how great Cambridge is.\nJourney time: 52 minutes from King’s Cross Station via Great Northern /Thameslink rail services.\n \nRoyal Tunbridge Wells \n(Picture: Lonely Planet Images/Getty) Ancient Spa town Royal Tunbridge Wells is surrounded by gorgeous parks, landscaped gardens and listed buildings perfect for any weekend in the country. If you’re not into walking, the high street is dotted with designer shops, and the tea-rooms are twee enough to thaw even your cold, urbanised heart.\nJourney time: 50 minutes to Royal Tunbridge Wells from Cannon Street or Charing Cross Stations via Southeastern Railway .\n \nBrighton \n(Picture: Shutterstock) Much to the locals’ despair, Brighton has earned the nickname ‘London by the Sea’ for its proximity to the capital and simply massive weekend tourist trade. There’s a reason people flock here. It’s pretty, it’s liberal, it has the best fish and chips and it’s a lot of fun.\nJourney time: 56 minutes from Victoria to Brighton via Gatwick Express , or from London Bridge via Southern Railway services.\n \nCanterbury Cathedral \n(Picture: Angel Villalba/Moment/Getty) One of the highest seats in the Church of England is less than an hour away. Founded in 597 A.D., Canterbury Cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Sitewhich hosts everything from communion to history workshops and recitals from choirs and orchestras worldwide.\nJourney time: 55 minutes to Canterbury West Station via Southeastern rail services.\n \nThorpe Park \n(Picture: Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images) Ok, so Staines might not be your first choice for a weekend outing, but hear me out. Hop on the 456 bus from Elmsleigh and you can be at Thorpe Park in less than half an hour. Now that’s more like it.\nJourney time: 35 minutes from Waterloo Station to Staines via South West Trains , followed by a 10-minute bus ride to Thorpe Park’s main entrance.\nMORE: Woman quits her job to travel the world in a teardrop trailer \nMORE: Gynopedia is the online reproductive health resource every female traveller needs ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T09:57:30.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
