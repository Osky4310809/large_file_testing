Broadly speaking, the more rural the state, the larger his margin of victory. So it is puzzling that he would nominate a U.S. secretary of Education whose policy priorities offer little to people living in rural areas. \nTrumpâ€™s nominee, Betsy DeVos, is a billionaire philanthropist and advocate who has focused intensely on letting parents use public funds to send their children to the traditional, charter or private school of their choice. That background now is threatening her confirmation. Several senators who intend to oppose her, including Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have specifically cited worries about rural areas . \nWhile many in education policy can ( and do ) debate the merits of school choice in urban settings, its benefits to rural communities are much less clear. A school reform program predicated on choice cannot work for the vast majority of rural communities because most rural school districts are too small to afford more than one school at a given grade span. In fact, many rural districts are more concerned about keeping the school they have than about adding a new school. \nSimply put, most rural districts lack the enrollment and finances to support multiple schools. In fact, only around 20% of them currently have more than one elementary school. The problem gets worse as children grow up: Only 7% of rural districts have more than a single high school. According to recent federal data , only around 6% of rural students attend a private school, suggesting private options are also uncommon in rural communities .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:02:23.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
