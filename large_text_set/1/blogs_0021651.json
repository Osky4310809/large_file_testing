My 600-lb Life 's Wednesday, January 25, episode introduced Kirsten Perez , whose doctor told her he would stop weight-loss treatment following her gastric-bypass surgery if she didn’t visit a therapist. Luckily, his tough love worked, as Kirsten stuck with the prescribed program (including seeing a therapist) to lose a miraculous 170 pounds. PHOTOS: Celebrities' Weight Loss and Transformations: Before and After Pictures \nHailing from Longview, Washington, 38-year-old Kirsten weighed in at 612 pounds before undergoing the show’s drastic weight-loss process, finishing at 442 pounds a year later. Kirsten struggled with anger issues and frequently snapped at her family, even as her kin were helping her.

Do you understand me?” \nIn a post-appointment interview, Nowzaradan summarized Kirsten’s condition, saying, “This is not a good situation at all. I’m really disappointed right now in Kirsten. … She needs a wake-up call.” \nKirsten finally gave in and went to see psychiatrist Lola Clay, who effectively tapped into some of Kirsten’s most intense emotional trauma, including a brutal gang-rape experience at age 17. Kirsten is resting, and does not feel well. TLC \nClay tied Kirsten’s need to eat as a self-inflicted punishment for feeling partially responsible for the sexual assaults. Kirsten then opened up about her past, which was crucial for Nowzaradan to continue to be on board with her ongoing treatment. \n“You have written a narrative in your mind where you’re just as culpable as the perpetrators,” Clay told Kirsten during the appointment. “Let go of [the] responsibility. … It’s important that you skew your thinking towards the positive.” \nThe psychiatrist then recommended a self-affirmation mantra for Kirsten to continue thinking optimistically: “I will not abuse my body with food. Above all else, I will love and respect myself.” \nAmong Kirsten’s biggest obstacles to success, ironically, was her son, Neiko, who resented having to move to Houston for her intensive weight-loss process. Neiko attempted to sabotage Kirsten’s focus by burping, using curse words and eating junk food and sugary drinks in front of her. Neiko said he just wanted to return to Washington, and was eventually sent home by his mom.
