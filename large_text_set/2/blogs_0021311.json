The researchers didn’t take performance anxiety into account, which could potentially have a more immediate effect on your stamina. \n“The time between the two measurement points in the study was several years, which may be too long to find meaningful associations,” Ventus told PsyPost . “It would be interesting to measure anxiety and sexual functioning every day for a period of time, and see if we could find some short-term associations. Also, one could use a measure of (performance) anxiety related to the specific sexual situation instead of more general anxiety measures.” \nWhat’s more, there weren’t many severe cases of premature ejaculation reported in this study. It all boils down to whether or not you actually have a problem in the first place: Your average, “normal” American man only lasts 13 minutes in bed, says Landon Trost, M.D., a urologist and Head of Andrology and Male Infertility at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
