So when such ethos is created, then such incidents do take place. From the last two months behaviour of president Trump. He is something of a clone of Prime Minister Modi and both should desist from it, I think that is the larger lesson to be learnt,” said Aiyer. By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 24, 2017 6:27 PM Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyer (IE) \nAmidst the horror after a heinous crime against Indian-engineer in Kansas, United States, where an American navy veteran shot him hurling racial abuses, senior congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyer called US president Donald Trump a clone of Prime Minister Modi. he said, that the situation in America since the past two months is like the arrival of Narendra Modi and the BJP coming to the peak of power in 2014. “Even if they themselves don’t hurl racial abuses or take out a gun to shoot an individual, the ethos that the create in the country leads to violence against the minority,” said Aiyer. \nHe said, “I am afraid since Trump was made the head of state. Indeed from his inaugural speech, there is an ethos being created in the United states who distinguishes between those who in Trump-size have a right to be ‘American’ and call themselves ‘Americans’ and a whole host of ‘others’. And it so happens, the whole host of others tend to be coloured or happen to be of the Muslim state.” he said. \nYou May Also Like To Watch: \nMany have blamed the becoming of Trump as president as the reason for the Kansas shooting incident. An engineer, Srinivas Kuchibhotla was shot by an American Navy veteran in a bar in Olathe, Kansas, who called Kuchibhotla a ‘middle eastern’ and hurled at him saying, ‘get out of my country’. Today, Ex-US Indian Ambassdor to US N Chandra and also the kin of Kuchibhotla blamed ‘Trump’s America’ for the act of hate crime. \n“At one level there is a crazed individual who is expressing his own deep anxieties and deep prejudices, and therefore it not right to say that there is a general or widespread racial hatred in the United States against Indians. I don’t think that would be right,” said Aiyer to NewsX. \n“A head of government or a head of state can create an ethos. So when such ethos is created, then such incidents do take place. From the last two months behaviour of president Trump. He is something of a clone of Prime Minister Modi and both should desist from it, I think that is the larger lesson to be learnt,” said Aiyer.
