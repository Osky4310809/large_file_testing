It don’t matter if Donald Trump say, “Put the album out.” Maybe if Minister Farrakhan said put the album out then maybe I might go home tonight and throw something together and put it out.

When it’s finished. When it’s something that I’m pleased with because regardless of the 6 billion people on planet Earth, even if I put something out and the whole 6 billion say it’s absolutely beautiful and I don’t feel okay with it, I’m the one that carries that.” Embed from Getty Images \nJay Electronica has been signed to Jay Z’s Roc Nation since 2010 and has yet to release an album for the company. Judging by the interview with Billboard, it doesn’t exactly sound like the project is in its final stages. \nRead the full interview here .
