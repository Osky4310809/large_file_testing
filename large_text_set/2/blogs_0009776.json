That revered status is built on several sneakers and styles, but there’s little doubt that SUPRA’s Skytop series—a signature of rider Chad Muska—is one of the brand’s most iconic. Advancing the legacy of the brand’s flagship line of shoes, SUPRA introduces the Skytop V .\nAdapting the modern fascination with both skateboarding and traditional sport styling, a glance at the Skytop V’s silhouette shows a meeting of both traditional and modern sneaker design. By providing both lightweight athletic support and skate-smart shock absorption (not to mention style), the Skytop V is shooting to break boundaries in its footwear category. With three different monochromatic colorways releasing with the shoe—white, dried herb, and black respectively—the Skytop should fold into most wardrobes with ease.\n“Our SUPRA Skytop franchise has been an innovative and collaborative partnership with skate legend and icon, Chad Muska,” says noted brand president, Cape Capener. “It continues to lead the industry once again with the Skytop V and sets a higher standard by which all skate footwear is judged.”\nIf this preview has you begging to get your hands on the latest Skytop, fear not. The Skytop V hits Zumiez locations exclusively on February 15, expanding to select SUPRA retailers worldwide on February 16.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T19:21:55.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
