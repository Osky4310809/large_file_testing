Meghan has called for teenage girls in India to be given access to toilets and sanitary products (Photo: PA) \nThe stigma and shame of having their period also means teenagers find it hard to talk about their bodies, even with their families. \n\"With minimal dialogue about menstrual health hygiene either at school or home due to the taboo nature of the subject, many girls believe their bodies are purging evil spirits, or that they are injured once a month,\" Meghan pointed out. \n\"This is a shame-filled reality they quietly endure. All of these factors perpetuate the cycle of poverty and stunt a young girl's dream for a more prolific future.\" Meghan, pictured with Prince Harry at a recent wedding, visited India in January (Photo: MEGA) \nShe said that when young teens drop out of school, they can be at risk of being put to work in dangerous conditions to bring in income, and may be married off at too young an age. \nMeghan, 35, said girls need education about menstrual health hygiene, access to toilets and sanitary pads in order to change things, adding: \"When we empower girls hungry for education, we cultivate women who are emboldened to effect change within their communities and globally. \n\"If that is our dream for them, then the promise of it must begin with us. Period.\" \nThe actress has been working with World Vision, the same charity that Harry's mum Princess Diana campaigned for. \nShe had previously visited Afghanistan and Rwanda with the same NGO, working to improve the lives of children in third-world nations. \nShe recently explained why she felt driven to champion worthy causes, saying: \"While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, coexist. And for me, they must.

And this type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T14:47:41.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
