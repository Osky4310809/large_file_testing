Every year, several celebrities participate in this photo shoot to explore a different side of them, and Daboo captures the moment with his lens. This is tradition has been going on since 18 years. \nThe best part about this calendar is that it gives a whole new look to Bollywood celebrities, stuff no one has been privy to in the past. This year, from Alia Bhatt to Priyanka Chopra to SRK, everybody is part of this fancy calendar. See if your favourite star made it to this list. \nP.S. Sunny Leone also makes her Daboo Ratnani calendar debut in this one.
