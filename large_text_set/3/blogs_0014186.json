Their reasons to be online can be varied, from mums wanting to be in touch with their kids, to job goers turning to social media for networking and socialising, to friends connecting with each other after years thanks to Facebook, everyone is online and there isn't really a lot you can do about it. \nWith the upward chart of social media usage, you can also see its effects in your relationships, and that's where a worrying bit comes in. \nSocial media cheating. So what is social media cheating? \nIt is when you are having relations with another person, purely online. There is no physicality involved here, but it could lead to it later depending on how your relationship progresses. Everything - from sexting, to sharing nudes, to having emotional conversations with someone - can be included here, but the definition remains slightly ambiguous because this is not your traditional case of cheating. Experts refer to it as a virtual affair, or online infidelity, and just like it happens with an affair you will see your partner withdrawing from you at an emotional level. So do you have to really worry, since there is no sex involved? \nYes, you have to be worried, to be honest. First off there is an emotional connect that you've got to worry about. Many people say that an emotional connect can be far worse than a physical one, and in this case, where people are not actually meeting, simply talking about their feelings, the kind of person they are, and what are they made of, it will harder for them to disconnect from it. \nSecondly, just the fact that someone is going to be so invested in their online affair suggests that their time with you is going to get affected. Even though there is no physical meeting, your partner is going to be in touch with this person at all hours, so you will see a change in the time that you both get to spend together. So what can you do? \nYou can't really accuse him or her of cheating in this case, but you do need to sit down and have a chat. Make your partner understand that this intimacy makes you uncomfortable, and you are not okay with them sharing life details with someone online. \nTalk to them about how you feel this can cause problems further on. Asking your partner to refrain from chatting with their ex, or a colleague is okay - as long as you have a valid reason to get worried, you can make this demand without sounding unreasonable.
