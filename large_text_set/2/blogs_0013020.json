The notorious 105-story Ryugyong Hotel – frequently referred to as the “Hotel of Doom”– could come to life after all, as Egyptian company Orascom started working on the project again in 2008. \nThe structure, designed by Baikdoosan Architects & Engineers, first broke ground in 1987 in Pyongyang, North Korea. It was supposed to open in 1989, two years later after the frame was finished. Work stopped in 1992 after the collapse of the Soviet Union (an ally and backer), and the hotel remained unfinished , looming over the North Korean capital.

Reports say that the interior has no plumbing or electricity, and it could require another $2 billion to finish. As of late construction on the hotel has stopped again, leaving the fate of the hotel unresolved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:19:01.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
