Immediately after Phoenix's 107-101 defeat, reports started surfacing that Bledsoe would not play again in 2016-17. Confirmed the Suns are shutting down PG Eric Bledsoe for the season. He's been playing through knee soreness. â€” Doug Haller (@DougHaller) March 16, 2017 \nCombined with the continued absence of veteran guard Brandon Knight, it would appear that Tyler Ulis will be the starting point guard for the Suns moving forward. The rookie out of Kentucky posted 13 points and 13 assists in 39 minutes of action against Sacramento. \nBledsoe, meanwhile, will miss the final month of what was a career year. In his fourth season with Phoenix, the former first-round pick was averaging 21.1 points, 6.3 assists, 4.8 rebounds and 1.4 steals per contest. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T14:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:50:56.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
