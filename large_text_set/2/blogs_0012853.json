The US explicitly called for that arrangement under Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama. The Trump official's comments drew a response from PLO Executive Committee Member Hanan Ashrawi, who said that if Trump was \"trying to create alternative realities, then he should spell out what the options are. A one-state solution would require equal rights and citizenship for all, unless he is advocating an apartheid state.\" There are growing questions about whether a two-state solution is even possible, given Israel's continued settlement building, said Diana Buttu, a former spokeswoman for the Palestinian Liberation Organization who now teaches at Harvard University. Since Trump's inauguration, Israel has announced 6,000 new settlement homes and legalized settler outposts in the West Bank. \"They've done that for 20 years, say they want a two-state solution, build settlements and destroy Palestinian homes,\" Buttu said. \"That's not the behavior of someone who wants peace.\" As a result, young Palestinians are \"increasingly talking very openly about a struggle for one person, one vote,\" Buttu said. Many Israelis, on the other hand, say that the Palestinians haven't warmly embraced a two-state solution either, pointing to polls showing that the idea has dropping support among the Palestinian public and arguing that its leaders haven't been willing to participate in the direct talks needed to reach an agreement. Netanyahu, Trump push reset of US-Israel relationship Netanyahu, who endorsed the idea of two states in 2009 under pressure from the Obama administration, sidestepped questions about whether he still supports the concept Wednesday, saying instead he wanted to avoid \"labels\" and talk substance: the need for Palestinians to recognize Israel as a Jewish state and the need for Israel to have overriding security control. It's not clear how Netanyahu is going to persuade them to come to the table. He also didn't give a direct response when asked whether he would comply with Trump's request at the news conference that he \"hold back\" on settlement expansion. Pressed by reporters later Wednesday, the Israeli Prime Minister replied, \"I think we'll try to find a common understanding that is consistent with pursuit of peace and security.\" It was an early indication that getting the parties to comply with US aspirations in the Middle East can be a challenge. Natan Sachs, a fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, said that for Netanyahu, the point isn't so much \"to get to the deal with Palestinians, but to change the parameters and include the Arab states. That would be good for Israel if there is a deal with Palestinians, and it would be good for Israel if there isn't a deal.\" States aligned with Israel in their dislike of Iran include Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Israel has forged close but quiet security ties with these Sunni-majority nations over that shared view of Tehran. Now, Netanyahu is hoping to make those relationships more open and win Arab recognition of Israel by drawing these countries into negotiations on Mideast peace. \"I believe the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach,\" Netanyahu said at the White House, \"from involving our newfound Arab partners in the pursuit of a broader peace and peace with the Palestinians.\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T10:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:48:51.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
