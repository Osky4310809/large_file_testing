All of them around 20 years old, and except in one or two cases where we need experience and maybe we play a player who is 28 or 29 years old because we are sure he is going to give us two or three or four important years, but the younger they are the better.\" \nXavi wants to be Barca manager \nGuardiola spoke to City shortly after he met with the club's owners to discuss not just the summer transfer window but what lies ahead. \nGuardiola met City owner Sheikh Mansour, who bought the club in 2008, for the first time and the Catalan came away with the impression that he has been charged with laying the foundations for decades of success. \nBut he also admits there are some \"mistakes\" to correct when it comes to spending on transfer fees. \n\"We were here with the owner, the chairman, and they told me again to create something from the beginning,\" he added. \"We are going to create something for future generations. \n\"It was a pleasure to meet the owner for the first time. Khaldoon [Al Mubarak, the chairman] is the nicest person I ever met in my life, I met his family. I feel that they want to keep going and improve the mistakes, because people expect us to spend money and immediately have success, but people forget there are 20 teams in Europe who spend the same money as Manchester City; the English teams, Spanish teams, some of the Italian teams, important teams, like in Germany and Spain, they spend a lot of money like Manchester City. \n\"The people cannot expect we just spent money and have results immediately. To be in the elite in European football we need time, the money can help to advance that but it’s not immediate. When I speak with Khaldoon, and today with Sheikh Mansour, I felt it was a commitment for the long term. It doesn’t matter who the players will be, it doesn’t matter who the managers will be, they want to help the community and for Manchester not just to be recognised for one strong team, United, they want another one.
