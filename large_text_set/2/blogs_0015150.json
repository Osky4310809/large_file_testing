Checking out imaging capabilities of the most affordable smartphone with dual cameras, the SwagPhone Honor 6X By - February 20, 2017 \nCameras on smartphones have reached such a level of quality, that they can no longer be deemed as an add-on feature. In fact, in countries like India, quite a few people decide what their next smartphone would be on the basis of the phone’s camera prowess alone. Having a powerful snapper is a necessity for any smartphone, especially when it is subjected to the robust competition that we see in the budget segment today. And that’s exactly where the Honor 6X , better known as the SwagPhone, comes into the picture (pun intended). \nWhile most people would be happy with one decent camera on their smartphone, the Honor 6X provides you with two. Yes, two – which is quite interesting, since not many smartphones can boast of a dual-camera setup, that too, at a price that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket. Getting the specifications out of the way, the latest from Honor sports a 12MP Sony IMX386 sensor comprising a 6P lens aided by LED flash. However, what adds depth (quite literally) to this setup is the 2MP sensor that works in tandem with the primary camera module. All this results in a combination which Honor claims is capable of shooting “professional grade” images. \nThe Honor 6X can also lock focus onto the subject in just 0.3 seconds, thanks to the phase detection autofocus, while a wide aperture range of F/0.95-F/16 lets you adjust the blur of the background. \nTalking about focus, one of the mainstays of the dual cameras is the ability to change focus points after capture. In simple words, all you need to do is select the appropriate option and tap on the subject you want to be focused… and BOOM, the phone refocuses the picture based on your selection. Furthermore, the additional depth information results in an enhanced bokeh effect, which is perfect for shooting portraits. In a nutshell, the cameras on the Honor 6X offer good performance, in both well-lit and low light scenarios, with an enticing twist of the depth sensor. \nHaving decent hardware is one thing, but building capable software around it is what makes the deal sweet. Thankfully, Honor has done an amazing job with the software. Right from basic features, to advanced editing options such as a pro mode, night shot, ability to capture light trails, and more – its camera app is loaded to the gills. There are also useful editing options, and the most interesting amongst them is ‘splash’, which lets you highlight certain colors in the image. As they say picture is worth thousand words, have a look at the camera samples shot from the Honor 6X. \nAfter all that talk about the dual cameras, one doesn’t need to forget that there is one more camera on this metal-clad phone. The fascia flaunts an 8MP front camera with a 77-degree wide angle lens and a Prim ISP. Additionally, a large pixel size of 1.25µm further strengthens the performance of the shooter in low light selfies. The brand has added a bunch of options for the selfie enthusiasts, such as self-adaptive skin colour detection as well as an auto portrait touch up the algorithm to make your selfies look even better. \nThe Honor 6X isn’t just about its cameras though. It also boasts a powerful hardware making it a compelling buy. Interested folks can pick the SwagPhone for themselves from Amazon India for the price tag of Rs 12,999 for the 3GB RAM model, and Rs 15,999 for the higher-end variant with 4gigs of RAM.
