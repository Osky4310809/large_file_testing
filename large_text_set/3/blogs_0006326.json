Linebacker Reuben Foster left the combine early during his medical examination, reportedly arguing with a hospital employee. Saban discussed the situation Wednesday, per Ryan C. Fowler of The Game on 1029: Ryan C. Fowler @RyanCFowler Nick Saban makes the quote on the year on Reuben Foster Do you want a linebacker or a candy striper ? https://t.co/Idtd3vaftY 3/8/2017, 7:21:29 PM As the coach explained, the player went through a bit of anxiety after he was forced to stay at the hospital for an extended period of time without answers. \"I know that Reuben wishes that he would have responded maybe in a little bit more positive way,\" Saban said. \"But I think other people could have responded and been a little more respectful to him as well.\" Foster sent a letter and met with teams personally to apologize and explain the situation. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, \"teams came away impressed\" after he took ownership of the incident. The endorsement from one of the most respected college football coaches ever should only help alleviate concerns among teams. \"Reuben's been a great player for us here, we've never had any issues with Reuben,\" Saban explained. Bleacher Report's Matt Miller still has Foster as the No. 3 overall player in the 2017 class following the combine.
