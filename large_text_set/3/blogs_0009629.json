Finally, the perfect response to all those faceless Hi’ s. \n\nWe have a shady “Basic” emoji, riffing on The Gap’s logo. There’s what looks to us like a Mean Girls emoji, but don’t quote us on that. \nThere’s a top bunk and bottom bunk emoji… but, unfortunately for some of us, no one directly in-between top and bottom bunk. No middle bunk emoji, but maybe the next update. \n\nThere’s a Truvada emoji, which… we’re looking forward to the think pieces. A Polaroid snap featuring an eggplant… we understand. A gym bunny that can lift dumbbells with its ear. \n\nSpanking the money? Jockstrap? 420? We read you loud and clear. There’s even a catfish for those unruly cases of identity theft. \n\nJust look at that jazz hand as a confident twink bursts out of the closet — we’re inspired. \nNot sure what to make of the guy vomiting a rainbow. Maybe editors decided a purse falling out of his mouth was too on the nose? \n\nWe have to say, we’re totally into this new development and hope there’s more to come. \nGrindr has somehow achieved the impossible, taking all the tired tropes that make the app so irritating — Pics? Into? Top? Bottom?– and making them playful gun. \nWho knows? Used correctly, maybe you’ll even get laid. \nWhat do you think of Grindr’s new emoji? Worth the update? Sound off in the comments below.
