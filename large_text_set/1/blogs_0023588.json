First of all, there is no doubt that Trump is going to be a great friend to Israel. But yet, the left is accusing him of antisemitism? \nThe Steve Bannon antisemitism thing has been debunked so many times it’s not even worth getting into. \nYou would expect this kind of nonsense from a left wing blogger or nonserious politicians like Bernie Sanders but you would think a guy like Tim Kaine would know better. \nApparently not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T04:10:44.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
