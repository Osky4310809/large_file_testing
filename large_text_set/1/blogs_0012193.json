That's an argument that will not create a single job in my community, not bring back a single of the 70,000 factories that have been closed, will not deter one member of ISIS from doing their bloodletting here or anywhere else in the world.\"\nShe continued, \"As a woman, I'm very proud to belong to a party that respects the fact that my husband and I work hard,\" adding \"For you to use sexual assault to try to make news here I think is unfortunate, but it also doesn't matter because Donald Trump promised he'll be the president of all Americans.\"\n\nIn Conway's response, she also criticized Hillary Clinton, pointing out that \"She should have gotten 60 or 62 percent of the female vote.\"\n During a taping of \"Access Hollywood\" in 2005, Trump was caught admitting to and even bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent. The recording emerged during Trump's presidential campaign. \nSince the release of the recording, dozens of women have come forward and accused Trump of sexual assault or sexual misconduct. Trump has denied all allegations against him, calling all of the women who came forward \"liars.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T10:46:26.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
