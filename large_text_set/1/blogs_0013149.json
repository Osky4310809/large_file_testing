(Charlie De Mar/CBS) \n(CBS) – A Chicago alderman says criminals are shooting for sport, after four people were shot – one of them fatally – with an assault rifle on the city’s Southwest Side Wednesday night. \nThe shooting happened about 6 p.m. near 42nd and Talman, but the victims drove off and were found about a mile away at Western and Archer in a parking lot. \n“There’s no rhyme or reason – they are almost killing for sport, just so they can say they killed that gang member or that gang member, for the bragging rights of saying that they killed people,” 15 th Ward Ald. Ray Lopez told reporters. \nHe says a group of gang members in a white van drove into the Brighton Park neighborhood and cornered another group of young men, possibly gang members, ambushing them and firing what Lopez said was an “assault-style” rifle. \nShell casings littered the street. \nThe injured men tried driving to a nearby hospital, only making it to the parking lot. One of the men was found dead in the car. \nThe shooting happening just steps from Shields Elementary School. \n“This is unacceptable,” Lopez said. \nThe man who died was 18 years old. The other shooting victims where all at area hospitals. \nNo arrests have been made, police said. \nCharlie De Mar Charlie De Mar is a general assignment reporter for CBS 2.
