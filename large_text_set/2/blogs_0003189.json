Cobb in the complaint. \nQuoting the article itself, Cobb argues Buzzfeed admitted it had no idea if any of the dossier was true and notes that eight follow-up articles each link back to the original publication. The dossier asserts that XBT and its affiliates used botnets and porn to transmit viruses, steal data and conduct \"altering operations\" against the leaders of the Democratic party. Gubarev says no one contacted him to verify the claims prior to publishing the article. \nThe suit claims that not only has the story hurt the company's reputation, it's put Gubarev and his family in harms way. \n\"Aleksej Gubarev, who is married with three young children is not, in any way, shape, or form, a public figure,\" writes Cobb. \"As a result of Buzzfeed and Mr. Smith’s reckless publication of defamatory materials, he has found his personal and professional reputation in tatters. His wife has found herself a target of online harassment and the family’s personal security has been compromised.\" \nThat argument is meaningful because if Gubarev were a public figure he would have to prove Buzzfeed acted with \"actual malice\" to succeed on his defamation claim. It's a high bar that requires proof that the outlet either knew the statements were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth — but, if the court agrees he's a private citizen, Gubarev won't face that uphill battle. \nGubarev is suing for defamation and defamation per se and is seeking at least $15,000 in damages. \nBuzzfeed issued a statement in response to the lawsuit Friday afternoon: “We have redacted Mr. Gubarev's name from the published dossier, and apologize for including it.” Ashley Cullins", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:12:11.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
