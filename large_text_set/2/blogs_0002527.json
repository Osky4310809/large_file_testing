(AP Photo/Bill Feig) ORG XMIT: NYOTK \nSean Payton has noticed that social media is becoming a distraction, and the recent incident with Antonio Brown in Pittsburgh has made everyone realize how easily that distraction can become a problem. \nDuring an appearance on the Tiki and Tierney show on CBS Radio , Payton noted that he can’t conduct a meeting for more than 40 minutes without his players itching to grab their phones. And while he’s adjusted his approach to better reach his players and keep their attention, he doesn’t want them on social media before games.

The coach called the device a \"scrambler,\" but the exact nature of how the device will operate is not known. \n“It’s just a simpler scrambler that just avoids the social media aspect.

But that being said, I would have been pissed. Look, corporate America is dealing with the same issue. In the work world, employees at their desk, how much time are they spending on social media.
