Motown legend Smokey Robinson headlines the pavilion on Sept. 15. Gladys Knight will share the bill with festival newcomer/veteran pop singer Michael Bolton on Sept. 1. The Temptations , along with the Beach Boys, will perform July 2. Chicago cabaret legend Spider Saloff presents a tribute to the songs of Peggy Lee on Aug 25 in Bennett Gordon Hall. \n“Our audiences have come to expect everything from our programming, and we truly hope our lineup continues to reflect our ongoing commitment to bring as wide a variety of music as we can to our audiences,” said Ravinia’s president and CEO Welz Kauffman. \nFans of this year’s Oscar-winning film “La La Land” can experience a lawn/pavilion screening of the film with its score performed in concert by the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra conducted by George Stelluto on June 18.

Conductor Lionel Bringuier makes his CSO debut (in a program with pianist Yuja Wang ) July 11. \nKent Nagano makes his Ravinia debut on July 25, conducting the CSO as part of Ravinia’s multi-concert celebration of Pulitzer-Prize winning composer John Adams’s 70th birthday. \nThe Cleveland Baroque Orchestra makes its Ravinia debut with Apollo’s Fire and Jeannette Sorrell conducting Vivaldi’s “The Four Seasons: Rediscovered” July 27. Venezuelan conductor/violinist Gustavo Dudamel will lead the National Youth Orchestra of Venezuela in a program of Prokofiev, Castellanos, Orbon and Bernstein, among others, Sept. 14. \nAlso making his Ravinia debut is Tony Award-winning “Hamilton” star Leslie Odom Jr. , performing in the Martin Theatre Aug. 13. “We really wanted him on the pavilion but he wanted the Martin because he’s been doing these incredible cabaret shows and he wanted that intimacy of the Martin, to be able to connect with his audience in that setting,” Kauffman said of Odom, who won the Tony for his portrayal of Aaron Burr in the Broadway musical.

She performs mostly downtown [Chicago] so I’m thrilled we could finally make it work here. … It takes time for artists to understand their audiences will come [to Highland Park]. … Our accessibility by car and by train — how many festivals have a train that drops patrons off at the front gate — is one of our key assets.” Boris Alexander Stein (left) and Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic perform in Berlin, Germany in 2016.

Los Tigres del Norte and Natalia Jimenez will headline the pavilion. \nTickets for all concerts will go on sale March 22 exclusively to Ravinia donors. The general public on-sale begins May 9 at ravinia.org . \nThe complete concert schedule/lineup can be found at ravinia.org .
