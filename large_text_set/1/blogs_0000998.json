Duble required 11 stitches. Still, the attackers didn’t steal anything, and such an attack seems to fit the pattern of the “knockout game.” Galveston police are investigating the attack. \nThe purpose of the game is to attack strangers by punching them in the head so hard that they are immediately knocked out. \nIn 2011, an elderly man was killed in St. Louis after being attacked in the game. \nLiberal news outlets have previously tried to downplay the existence of the game. MSNBC’s Chris Hayes gave the knockout game his award for “Most over-covered story of the year” in 2013, and said, “You get a sense of the racial politics and subtext — well, not even subtext — text.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T03:35:10.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
