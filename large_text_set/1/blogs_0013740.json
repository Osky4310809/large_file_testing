Game of Thrones theme covers, that's what. We've seen so many good ones over the years, it's hard to pick which one is the best.\nBut 2CELLOS, a duo of extraordinarily talented cellists from Croatia, have taken it to the next level.\nSEE ALSO: 2CELLOS: Two 20-somethings rocking out, making the cello cool\nIn the first single from their new album, \"Score,\" the duo — Luka Šulić and Stjepan Hauser — play a Game of Thrones medley with the London Symphony Orchestra. The cover is subtler than some others we've heard, but there's a lot of authorship in it as well, with the two cellists performing some string acrobatics in the second part of the song.\nThe video for the song was filmed in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik, which was the main filming location for the city of King's Landing in Game of Thrones .\nTwo years ago, we had a chance to host 2CELLOS in our Mashable offices in New York, so take a look at that performance as well.\nThe duo's new album will be released on March 17, and will contain many more cello/orchestra covers of popular film themes, including soundtracks from films such as Schindler's List and The Godfather .\nBONUS: 'Game of Thrones' fans think this cast photo could mean a huge Season 7 reunion", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/spZJoCGz.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/spZJoCGz.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcFpvolRN3w?enablejsapi=1&", "http://a.amz.mshcdn.com/assets/lib/aab-be381ac80ab7cb74cefd12800e062dbd.js"], "published": "2017-01-16T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T14:28:26.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
