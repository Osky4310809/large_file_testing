Leonard Dilkon: Pastor Ewenji granted bail \nAt the resumed hearing of the case on Wednesday, his counsel, Mr Smart Irabor, prayed the court to grant his client bail, quoting section 36 (5) of the 1999 constitution that held that an accused person was innocent until otherwise proven. \nIrabor told the court that his client would neither jump bail, nor interfere with police investigation. \n“I can also assure the court that my client will always be available for trial,” he said. \nIrabor further urged the court to grant the accused bail based on self-recognition. \nBut Mr Francis Okafor, counsel to the complainant, who did not object to the bail appeal, prayed that the court should take stringent measures in granting it. \n“This is important because the accused has been avoiding the court. \n“He has always refused to appear before the court to clear himself of the allegations levelled against him.” \nOkafor recalled that two bench warrants were issued on the accused but that it had always been difficult to serve him because “he moves around with armed policemen”. \nThe counsel said that the demand for bail on based on self-recognition was “an insult” to the court because the case was a direct criminal complaint and not a police prosecution. \nIn his ruling, the Chief Magistrate, Sam Galadima, admitted the accused to bail in the sum of N1.5 million and two sureties in like sum. \nGaladima said that the sureties must be persons of standing and proven integrity, and must also reside within the jurisdiction of the court. \nThe magistrate adjourned the matter till April 27, for further hearing.
