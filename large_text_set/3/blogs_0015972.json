(Michael Reynolds/Pool via Bloomberg) Some of President Trump’s support came from voters who did not agree with him on a number of issues and may not have liked him all that much. But, they reasoned, he was rich and successful so he could help America (and people like them) win. No question but that superficial aura of confidence and business experience Trump conjured up was enough to win over voters who didn’t much listen to the details of what he was saying or focus on his incoherent, a-factual utterances.\nTrump is losing more than he is winning — or hitting roadblocks that deplete momentum. After all, he’s lost repeatedly in court on his Muslim ban. He’s lost the support of Republicans and Democrats alike who say his allegations of wiretapping are bunk. The FBI director has debunked his crazy allegation and confirmed a serious investigation into Russian meddling in our election is underway. Despite his best efforts to distract from Russian interference in the election on his behalf news of his associates’ connections to Russia surface regularly.\nIt’s not clear if Trump will lose the vote in the House on the American Health Care Act, but he’s virtually assured of losing in the Senate without significant changes that then are likely to lose support from right-wing Republicans. Tax reform, if Congress ever gets to it, is already mired in a giant fight between advocates and opponents of the border adjustment tax.\nIn foreign policy, Trump is losing stature by the minute, presenting himself as a blunderbuss who doesn’t even know how NATO works. The German defense minister couldn’t take it any longer and publicly admonished the president for his repeated assertion that German “owes” us money:\nGerman Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s claim that Germany owes NATO and the United States “vast sums” of money for defense.\n“There is no debt account at NATO,” von der Leyen said in a statement, adding that it was wrong to link the alliance’s target for members to spend 2 percent of their economic output on defense by 2024 solely to NATO.\n“Defense spending also goes into UN peacekeeping missions, into our European missions and into our contribution to the fight against IS terrorism,” von der Leyen said.\nTrump has to create enemies to fight with and vanquish (lest he be judged on his own puny accomplishments), but his daily fight with the press has grown tiresome. No matter how much he insists news outlets are “losing” (subscriptions, revenue), legacy media is booming. And the press, unlike his presidential primary opponents, don’t go away. They come back each and every day to challenge him and highlight his team’s blunders.\nNone of this means his presidency has failed, although he is digging himself quite a hole. Trump’s losing streak nevertheless might be the cause of his plummeting poll numbers. In the most recent Fox News poll , his approval dropped 5 points (to 43 percent approval, 51 percent disapproval). He’s also hit a new low in Gallup polling with only 37 percent approval and 58 percent disapproval . At about this point in their presidencies, Presidents Barack Obama (62/27), George W. Bush (58/22) and Bill Clinton (53/34) were sailing along in their political honeymoons. (And this polling all comes before FBI director James B. Comey’s devastating testimony today.)\nPerhaps the idea of a blunt, even boorish, billionaire as president (and the hope he’d eventually grow into his job) was appealing enough (just barely) with the help of Russian counterintelligence to beat (in the electoral college) a weakened, life-long pol. But so far Trump’s not maintaining the mystique of a winner. If he doesn’t start winning a bit, he’ll be consigned to the list of feeble, one-term presidents. Indeed, so far he most resembles Jimmy Carter, another president who never lived up to expectations.", "external_links": ["http://www.gallup.com/poll/201617/gallup-daily-trump-job-approval.aspx", "http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/324202-fox-news-poll-trump-approval-rating-drops-5-points", "https://twitter.com/@JRubinBlogger", "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-germany-defence-idUSKBN16Q0D8"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:18:26.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
