OLED attraction \nThe rumour mill says that there will be incremental iPhone 7S models but also an anniversary 5.8in iPhone 8 that could cost more than US$1000 (RM4439). \nWhy so many phones and why the price? Apple tends to release incremental updates but seeing as it is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, that might not be enough this year. The special edition iPhone, which will probably be very popular despite the price, is said to have an OLED screen which are far pricier and in limited supply, thus making it harder to produce in larger quantities for cheaper. \nAnother incentive to go for the pricier iPhone is that it might have certain features, such as a Home button in its screen and instead of side buttons, there iwll be touch-sensitive inlays. Expect a metal frame as well as a glass back. \nAlso rumoured is Apple incorporating Lumentum's 3D-sensing technology into the phone. Exactly how that will work is a mystery - will it be in the camera for AR? Will it be for facial recognition? \nIn the meantime, you can check out what we think about Apple's latest, greatest iPhone so far, the iPhone 7 Plus .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:06:42.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
