AFP \nLOS ANGELES, United States — LeBron James has vented his frustration with the Cleveland Cavaliers’ threadbare playing resources following the team’s latest defeat. \nThe Cavaliers slumped to a 124-122 loss against New Orleans on Monday, despite a triple double from James and a 49-point display from Kyrie Irving. \nThe defeat was the Cavs’ sixth in their past 10 games, and followed a 126-91 rout by the Golden State Warriors last week and a 118-115 overtime loss to San Antonio at the weekend.

It’s tough,” James said. “We’re a top-heavy team. We have a top-heavy team … It’s me, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love. It’s top-heavy. \n“I don’t know what we got to offer. I just know me, personally? I don’t got no time to waste. I’ll be 33 in the winter, and I ain’t got time to waste. That’s what I’m talking about.” \nJames said he had already spoken with Cavaliers general manager David Griffin to register his frustration. \nJames speaks from a position of strength. Last season he helped Cleveland end its 52-year wait for a professional sports championship by inspiring the Cavaliers back from a 3-1 series deficit against Golden State to win the NBA Finals. \nThis year he is also excelling, averaging 25.6 points per game, 8.4 assists and 7.4 rebounds, while the Cavaliers are still leading the Eastern Conference with a record of 30-13.
