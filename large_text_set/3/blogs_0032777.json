He is the freshman point guard out of West Linn High School, where he won four consecutive state championships, and now this precocious native son of Oregon sits on the Final Four stage two victories from yet another championship — this one a national championship.\nPeach fuzz above his lip and on his chin, the Ducks guard smiles that 19-year-old smile when asked if winning championships gets old and says: “Nah, that will never get old. Once you win one, you just want to keep winning more.”\nLew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) led Power Memorial to three consecutive Catholic League crowns before winning another three in a row at UCLA. Payton Pritchard, at 6-foot-2, 201 pounds, is no such singular threat to orchestrate a dynasty, but North Carolina better beware in Saturday night’s semifinal.\n“That was actually my favorite team growing up when I was a little kid, so I’m excited to play ‘em,” Pritchard said.\nA year ago, he scored 25 points in a 74-48 rout of South Medford at the Chiles Center in Portland.\n“He’s gonna rip your heart out,” his high school coach, Eric Viuhkola, told The Post by phone. “He wants to destroy people. He’s like, ‘Hey I don’t put this time in and I don’t work this hard to me giving anybody breaks.’\n“He’s just a straight killer.”\nAn iceman. Ask him to describe his on-court mentality and The Kid Who Always Wins says: “Calm, cool, collected. I’m not really gonna show like a bunch of emotion out there unless it comes down to really big plays, then you’ll see stuff. But most of the game I’m gonna stay the same face and just play throughout.”\nRemember Never Nervous Pervis Ellison from Louisville? This is Never Nervous Payton.\n“I don’t get nervous for games because I feel like all the hard work I put in there’s no need to get nervous,” Pritchard says. “I have no butterflies, it’s like I just rely on everything I put in. It’s just time to show it.”\nHe is a gym rat who would have made Chris Mullin and Billy Donovan look like slackers by comparison. \n“In every little thing that he does, he’s gonna find a way to win,” Viuhkola said. “His senior year, on a Tuesday night, we’re playing our rival, Lake Oswego, and Payton scores 45 points. It’s a career high, he could have had 55, I took him out late. … The next morning, at 6:30 in the morning, he’s there with me. And when he comes through the door I go, ‘Hey Payton, if it was me and I scored 45 points the night before, that might be a day that I think I might sleep in.’ He goes, ‘Uh coach, that doesn’t mean anything.’ He doesn’t settle. He’s always grinding, he’s always trying to get better.”\nWhat drives Payton Pritchard? \n“Just a love for the game,” he said. “A lot of people say they work hard and all that, but like I really truly love to be in the gym and put in hours. I want to be the best. I know it’s a process and everything, but I really do want to be the best.”\nOregon’s Payton Pritchard Getty Images The Kid Who Always Wins never believed he would lose at West Linn. \n“After we won it our freshman year is when I remember his mom coming to me and going, ‘Payton says we’re gonna win four in a row,’ ” Viuhkola said.\nPayton actually had said it earlier. \n“Before even high school, I told people I was gonna win four straight,” Pritchard said. “I just believed that. I just kinda walk around with a confidence like that.”\nHe unseated Casey Benson, last year’s point guard, five games into the season, and averages 7.4 points and 3.7 assists per game.\n“I’m really proud of him,” Viuhkola said. “It hasn’t been just like an easy transition because of Payton’s mentality. He has sacrificed a lot of his game for the team being a freshman and being the new guy. He’s having a blast and he’s loving this experience, but there’s part of him like he knows that he can do a lot more, but he knows that this year his role is kinda get the team in the offense and play great defense and do those things. He will be an All-Pac-12 guy next year.”\nIt’s no wonder Villanova recruited The Kid That Always Wins.\n“They’re a winning program, so I was really interested in them,” Pritchard said.\nHe preferred to stay close to home, and is glad he did. He even got to ask Kobe Bryant a question when the former Lakers legend addressed the Ducks on Wednesday night.\nPayton Pritchard Getty Images “I asked him like what was his workout offseason, like what would he do and how would he prepare?’” Pritchard said.\nKobe’s response?\n“He was just talking about how he’d like make 1,000 shots a day,” Pritchard said.\nViuhkola calls Pritchard “the toughest kid I’ve ever been around.” \nThe coach will be in the stands watching this remarkable Drive for Five.\n“Hopefully I can win another championship, that’d be crazy,” The Kid Who Always Wins said. “That’d be unreal.” \nQuack to the Future perhaps.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:34:57.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
