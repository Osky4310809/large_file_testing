His name has not yet been released. \nAccording to police, he may have been involved in a shooting incident the night before, ran from the scene and hid in the yard. \nThat incident happened around 8 p.m. Wednesday at the intersection of LaSalle and Broadway Avenues. \n“About 8 o’clock last night, I heard fireworks. I looked out the window and didn’t see nothing,” said Maier. “I just heard fireworks… like rapid fire.” \nAnyone with information on the case is asked to call Dormont Police or the Allegheny County Police homicide unit at 412-473-1300 . \nThey are also asking anyone with surveillance cameras in the area to contact them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:13:10.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
