It is restricted to local produce in those areas because we do not want other trades to get in. We are looking at such informal trade also with other border areas. But nothing has been firmed up as of now,” he said here at a function. \nAlso watch: \nAbout the implementation of the WTO’s trade facilitation agreement (TFA) in goods, Shah said India is largely compliant with the provisions of this global pact. \nAsked about the investment required for the full implementation of the pact, he said: “I do not think that it is too daunting for us to ensure we implement the TFA in both letter and spirit.” \nShah also said changes in certain laws are required for the pact which the government will do within a stipulated window. \nThe WTO’s trade facilitation pact will help promote global trade in several ways such as facilitating movement of goods and effective functioning of ports. \nThe agreement, which seeks to ease Customs norms, came into effect last month with two-thirds of WTO members ratifying the pact. \nIndia will fund all its projects like upgradation and digitisation of infrastructure for implementation of the trade facilitation pact.
