Apple traditionally skips device launches at WWDC, and focusses on showcasing new versions of iOS, macOS and watchOS at the event. Now it appears that the company will also be holding another event before WWDC in March. Japanese website Mac Otakara reports that the brand will be introducing new 128GB iPhone SE , red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and new iPad Pro line up at the event. \nAs per the report, Apple will add a new 128GB storage option to the iPhone SE, apart from the already available 16GB and 64GB variants. The news of the iPhone SE comes at an interesting time, given that Apple is set to start assembling the compact iPhone in India soon. The brand will also add a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which so far are available in Matte Black, Jet Black, Gold and Silver hues. The source earlier suggested the red hue for the upcoming iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models. \nAs for the new iPad Pro line up, the report claims that Apple will introduce new 7.9-inch, 9.7-inch, 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch models.
