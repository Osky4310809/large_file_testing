Ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), other Democrats, and at least one Republican lawmaker have asked for the chairman’s recusal from that investigation as a result.\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said that was up to House leadership, but that Nunes can’t continue to lead the committee if he is “not willing to tell the Democrats and Republicans on the committee who he met with and what he was told.”\nSen. John McCain (R-AZ) went further, telling TPM that both Nunes’ source and that source’s information should be revealed to “the entire nation.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:55:26.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
