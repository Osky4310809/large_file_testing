The 22-year-old Bayer Leverkusen midfielder has been banned for a breach of contract with Trabzonspor that occurred back in 2011 (and may or may not have involved Calhanoglu himself to a certain degree ), a ruling that has now been upheld on appeal, which means that the midfielder has to pay a €100,000 fine to Trabzon and sit out the rest of the season. But what interests us most in this case is what happens after he’s eligible to play again. According to Turkish media — and that carries a big huge giant YUGE warning flag as they’re notorious for not only inventing stories but actually putting quotes into players’ mouths — Calhanoglu has declared that “Allah willing, he will be a Chelsea player next season”. That story comes from Fanatik via Turkish-Football , and is the second time this season that Calhanoglu has been linked with Chelsea. Back in November, rumors also from Turkey claimed that Chelsea had a €20m bid rejected over the summer . Calhanoglu’s contract with Bayer runs through 2019, which means that this summer will be the ideal time for them to either renew or sell. The report does state that there are other teams interested as well. Calhanoglu it seems is never far from transfer controversy ( his move from HSV to Bayer wasn’t without incident either ), so perhaps we’d be well served to steer clear. That said, the kid’s talent is undeniable, especially on set pieces, and he’s been in good form for Bayer this season, scoring 6 goals in 15 Bundesliga appearances and adding one more in the Champions League group stages.
