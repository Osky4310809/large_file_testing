The 2017 event has raised over $150,000 and has a $6 million economic impact on The Woodlands community, said event director of The Woodlands Marathon Management Will Fowlkes . \nAside from the economic impact, it will force road closures across the community. Travel time will be extended during this time - approximately 45 minutes to an hour delay, according to the marathon's website. \nBetween 6:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., marathon officials recommend only residential traffic. A detailed list of road closures and delays can be found at thewoodlandsmarathon.com/event-details/traffic-guide/. However, check back on Friday, as the traffic guide will be updated then. \nFowlkes said residents should educate themselves on the ins and outs of the race, even if one is not participating. Fowlkes said the community should expect slight delays, but they'll still have the ability to commute around The Woodlands, they just may have to take alternative routes to get to destinations. \n\"Ninety to 95 percent of The Woodlands residents are OK with the events,\" Fowlkes said. \n\"It's just those residents that do not plan and educate themselves about the route that seem to get frustrated.\" \nSpecifically, Fowlkes said, the Town Center area on Grogan's Mill Road and Lake Woodlands Drive will be the most affected by the marathon and half-marathon. \nVehicles will be routed around those areas, but there will be rolling road openings throughout the race until 1:30 p.m. to ease delays. \nThose interested in participating can still register online for $40 for the 5K run or $30 for the 2K Family Fun Run and Walk.
