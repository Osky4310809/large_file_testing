The city began looking for alternatives at the end of summer 2015. \nde Blasio at the time denied the plan to close the large, controversial correction center — calling it a \"noble concept\" that couldn't work because it would \"cost many billions\" to do. \nRepresentatives for the mayor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T15:40:57.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
