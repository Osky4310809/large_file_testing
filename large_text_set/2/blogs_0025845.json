In the lead up to the third installment of the Rich Gang series since Rich Gang: The Tour , the pair have dropped some lavish visuals for the TM-88-produced track.\nDirected by frequent Thugger videographer Garfield Larmond, the video finds the Cash Money boss and the Slime Season star stunting in front a Bentley Bentayga, throwing bands of cash over hip-hop’s favorite truck (Future & Migos also have a penchant for mentioning it in their tracks).\nIt also sees the pair partying with beautiful women in red-neon lit rooms and generally partaking in the usual hip-hop hedonism associated with the duo. Garfield Marmond also directed the candid video for “Safe” – Thugger’s first solo music of 2017, which you can watch below.\n\nIn other music news, watch Future join Ariana Grande for the raunchy, sex-filled visuals for “Everyday”.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:34:07.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
