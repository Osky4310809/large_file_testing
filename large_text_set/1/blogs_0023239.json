Liverpool nearing crisis territory \n\"We have to play much better with more control of possession. If we had done, it could have actually been 3-0 or 4-0. Even in the first half we allowed too many counter attacks, so there is still a lot to improve. \" \nBayern are back in action against Schalke at the Allianz Arena next Saturday.
