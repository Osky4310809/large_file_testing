She has an MBA to her credit, and has an interesting list of big companies on her resume. Having worked with the Times of India , Carlson Group of Hotel, and Airtel, you would expect her to be at top of a corporate ladder at this point, working towards her leadership dreams; and that's exactly where she is at. The only difference is that she's not a part of the corporate culture anymore. Meet Chhavi Rajawat, India's first and youngest village Sarpanch with an MBA degree to her credit. \nIn a small village, about 60 kilometres from Rajasthan, you'll spot Chhavi hard at work, dedicated to helping the residents of Soda improve their lives. In a village where women still cover their faces with ghunghats , you'll easily spot Chhavi dressed in her signature jeans and a kurta with a scarf draped around her neck, sitting around a group of men trying to ensure that their day to day work gets done with minimal disruption. The first question that comes to mind when you see her, is how did she manage to make a space for herself in an environment that seems largely patriarchal? \n\"Because I spent a lot of time in this village as a child, they (the villagers) see and perceive me as the daughter of the village, which actually works to my advantage,\" she explains in a video story on her life, by Discovery Channel. \nShe has to her credit, in the seven years that she has been around, the construction of over 40 roads, installation of toilets in all the 900 houses, and even a bank in the village. Her ability to get the work done has certainly gotten her many dedicated votes, but she refuses to think about politics for now (Chhavi is not affiliated to any political party). \nTaking about her grandfather, Brig Raghubir's legacy - he was the Sarpanch of the village for 20 years prior to Chhavi - her main focus remains improving the quality of life there. If is, in fact, this dedication that brought her back from her corporate life to her village. Speaking about the transition (on her website), she says, \"I didn't have to think about it much, because Soda is where I belong and it needs me. In fact, the villagers broke all barriers of caste, gender, and religion to ensure my victory. In Soda, not even one per cent of the voters are from my own caste. They [the villagers] wanted to prove that development is the most important factor, for which they can overlook all politically created differences.\" \"I am just a village girl who has had an opportunity to study in some of the best institutions in the country, and has only gone back home to work with and for her people. It's as simple as that,\" she adds. \nHowever, her journey hasn't been all that easy. In a career span of seven year she has been attacked twice, by people who were angered by her decision to construct an IT centre on the village's common land. Chhavi, however, chooses to remain positive. \"If you want to make a difference, you have got to start at the bottom,\" is her motto. \nApart from being a full-time Sarpanch, she also continues to work at her family-run hotel business in Jaipur, and dedicates a part of her time at the Equest Horse Riding Academy that she has set up in Jaipur. \nChaavi's journey, if you had to sum it up, is the real life version of Swades . A woman who gave up her corporate journey to come back home, and make a real difference. With a trailblazer like Chhavi, we are confident of seeing some beautiful changes in the developing story of the country. More power to you, Chhavi Rajawat!!
