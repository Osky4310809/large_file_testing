Media caption Orla Guerin hears from civilians who escaped IS in Mosul \nHe added \"Any of the fighters who are left in Mosul, they're going to die there, because they're trapped. \n\"So we are very committed to not just defeating them in Mosul, but making sure these guys cannot escape.\" \nStaff Major General Maan al-Saadi, of Iraq's elite Counter-Terrorism Service, said government forces now controlled \"more than a third\" of western Mosul. Is so-called Islamic State finished? \nHe said he believed the fight would be easier than in eastern Mosul, which took 100 days to reclaim after the offensive was launched in October, finally falling in January. \nHowever, federal police and rapid response units say they have now entered the Bab al-Tob area of the Old City, where the fight is expected to be tough due to its narrow alleyways through which armoured vehicles cannot pass. \nMeanwhile, Joint Operations Command spokesman Brig Gen Yahya Rasool said he believed IS was weakening. \nBut he added: \"The battle is not easy... we are fighting an irregular enemy who hides among the citizens and uses tactics of booby-trapping, explosions and suicide bombers, and the operation is taking place with precision to preserve the lives of the citizens.\" \nIt is thought there may be as many as 600,000 civilians still trapped in IS-controlled areas of Mosul. \nThe statements came a day after Iraqi forces said that a \"large mass grave\" had been found near the city. \nIt contained the remains of hundreds of \"civilian prisoners who were executed by (IS) gangs after they controlled the prison during their occupation of Mosul\".
