She did not disappoint! In addition to treating us with a medley of her top hits, she brought the crowd those fun and dramatic looks that she's known for. \nShe opened up the show with a heart-rending performance of \"This Land Is Your Land,\" with her hair coiffed into a chignon with sweeping bangs. But what really caught our attention were clusters of crystals artfully arranged in a mask-like shape around her eyes. Sarah Tanno, who used Marc Jacobs Beauty makeup, was responsible for the look. \nAfter dramatically leaping off the roof to the stage, she loosened her hair, which was styled by Frederic Aspiras using Matrix products. This let her sexy, voluminous blowout surround her face. Eventually the crystal eye mask was removed to reveal a shimmery lavender eye with a bold wing and lush lashes. \nPunctuating the whole look was a bright orange-red lipstick that popped against her fair complexion and platinum hair. Tanno used Marc Jacobs Beauty Le Marc Lip Crème Lipstick in Dashing 206 ($30) to achieve the mouthy masterpiece. Read on to see all angles of her edgy Super Bowl beauty style.
