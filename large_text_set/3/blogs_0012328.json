By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 18, 2017 10:49 AM Digvijay Singh says that Rahul Gandhi needs to act more decisively. (Source: IE image) \nWhile Congress was busy finding answers for humiliating losses in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, it also missed the chance of forming the government in Goa and Manipur leading to infight within the party. Congress MLA Vishwajit Rane was the first one to raise a finger at the party leadership and now Digvijay himself has called for a ‘new Congress’. While speaking at The Indian Express Idea Exchange event, Singh asked for a new charter, a new roadmap and a new style of campaigning. He also demanded Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi to act decisively. He didn’t rule out the possibility of Priyanka Gandhi taking charge of the party by saying, “Congressmen throughout the country should be very happy if Priyanka Gandhi takes to active politics.” \n“I would say that we want a new Congress, a new charter, a new roadmap, a new style of campaigning. A new Congress has to be built, and there is no other person who can do it better than Rahul Gandhi. He has to act… My complaint against Rahul Gandhi is that he is not acting… decisively. I have told him a number of times. Sometimes, he gets angry when I keep repeating the same thing,” he said. \nYou may also want to watch: \nSingh was also critical about party’s loss in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He said,”We have to… make Congress more attuned to modern changing times, looking into the aspirations of a rising middle class, and chart a new course for the party.” However, he is confident that Rahul Gandhi is the right person to do so. “The leadership has to do it… Rahul Gandhi has to do it,” he added. \nDigvijay Singh also mentioned that AK Antony Committee report was taken very seriously by the party and was discussed by Rahul with more than 150 senior leaders. “This report was submitted on February 28, 2015. And on the basis of that report, the new Congress was to be drafted. Unfortunately, that has not happened. This should happen. We have leadership, we have leaders. (The) Nehru-Gandhi family is the greatest binding factor in Congress. The issue is not of leadership. The issue is of rejuvenating and redrafting the new Congress…,” he said.
