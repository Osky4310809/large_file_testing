Post to Facebook No. 1 Baylor avoids another setback, fends off Kansas State Manu Lecomte (26 points) helped the Bears bounce back and stay in the Big 12 title race.  //usat.ly/2jKhLlg   No. 1 Baylor avoids another setback, fends off Kansas State AP Published 7:19   | Updated 35 minutes ago Baylor guard Manu Lecomte (20) knocks the ball loose from Kansas State forward Dean Wade (32) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in Manhattan, Kan. (Photo: Orlin Wagner, AP) \nMANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Manu Lecomte scored 26 points after battling early foul trouble, Ish Wainright and Al Freeman had key baskets down the stretch and top-ranked Baylor outlasted Kansas State 77-68 on Saturday. \nWainright and Freeman had 15 points apiece for the Bears (15-1, 3-1 Big 12), who bounced back from a lopsided loss at No. 10 West Virginia in their first game as the nation's No. 1 team to deal the Wildcats (13-4, 2-3) another close, disheartening conference defeat. \nJohnathan Motley was held to seven points and nine rebounds before fouling out with 4:34 left and the Bears leading 62-55. But they managed to hang on down the stretch without their most dependable player. \nD.J. Johnson scored 20 points for Kansas State, including two free throws that got the Wildcats within five with just over four minutes to go. But the Wildcats were unable to make key stops the rest of the way, and the trio of Wainwright, Freeman and Lecomte seemed to will the Bears to victory. \nFreeman scored with just over three minutes left to make it 66-58, and Wainwright threw down a putback with about two minutes remaining that gave the Bears a 68-60 advantage. No. 9 West Virginia avoids upset at Texas \nKamau Stokes made a pair of foul shots moments later to give Kansas State a chance, but Lecomte's floater made it 70-62 with 1:35 left, and the Bears held on from there. \nBarry Brown finished with 13 points, Xavier Sneed added 12 and Stokes had 10 for the Wildcats, while Dean Wade was held to five points and two rebounds in 35 minutes. BIG PICTURE \nBaylor answered a lot of critics after its ugly showing in Morgantown by beating the Wildcats on the road. The Bears have won six of their last seven against Kansas State. \nKansas State has lost three of its last four games, including a last-second loss at No. 2 Kansas and a loss at Texas Tech where the Wildcats also led late. Those defeats coupled with a weak nonconference schedule could haunt the Wildcats when the NCAA Tournament field is set. UP NEXT \nBaylor heads home to face Texas on Tuesday night. \nKansas State heads to Oklahoma State on Wednesday night. \nHIGHLIGHTS: COLLEGE HOOPS ACTION THIS WEEK Facebook Posted!
