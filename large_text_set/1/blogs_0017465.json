But sometimes we fall in love with the more casual ensembles that travel down the red carpet. For example, Kristen Stewart wore sneakers, ripped jeans, and a sweatband to the World Premiere of her film, Come Swim, at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival.\nStewart looked as badass as ever in a black leather jacket and her signature dark kohl eyeliner. She wore two lock pendant necklaces and tied a gray sweatshirt around her waist. Pairing her red suede Adidas sneaks (with mustard laces) with those chunky gray socks drives home the super casual theme .\nGetty Images / VALERIE MACON The actress-turned-filmmaker makes her directorial debut with Come Swim, a short film that “conjures a stunningly kaleidoscopic portrait of one man’s emotional interior — unbounded darkness and desire,” as Refinery 29 writes on their site. Stewart worked together with Refinery 29’s online film platform Shatterbox Anthology, which aims to promote work by female directors.\nRefinery 29 released a teaser trailer for Come Swim today, and we can tell it’s going be intense, artsy, and beautiful. But honestly, could we expect anything less from Kristen Stewart? \nThrough her new work and her fashion, we can definitely tell that Stewart has grown up since her Twilight days. But we also love how she’s still rocking the broody, vampy style that we’ve been loving since day one.\nGetty Images / George Pimentel We have a feeling Come Swim is just the tip of the directing iceberg for Kristen Stewart. Judging by the trailer alone, it seems like she’s got an eye for film and we can’t wait to see what other behind-the-camera projects she delves into in the future.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T06:15:03.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
