Just another terrible decision!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017\nTrump’s figure is actually right on the nose: a 2016 Office of the Director of National Intelligence report found that 122 former Gitmo detainees have returned to the battlefield. But his attribution of their release to Obama is false; the vast majority of those detainees were released under President George W. Bush , a fellow Republican. Only nine of the 122 were released by Obama.\nUnsurprisingly, Trump’s tweet came thirty minutes after a Fox & Friends segment cited the exact same stat (Fox News did not incorrectly blame Obama, however).\nFormer Gitmo detainee killed by a U.S. airstrike in Yemen; at least 122 former Gitmo detainees have re-engaged in terrorism pic.twitter.com/y9jb420fFZ\n— FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) March 7, 2017\n[image via screengrab]\n——\n>>Follow Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) on Twitter\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/839076420018065408", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/HashtagGriswold", "https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/FINAL%20-%20GTMO%20Unclass%20CDA%20Response%20-%20September%202016.pdf", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fdonald-trump-falsely-blames-obama-for-violent-gitmo-detainees-released-under-bush%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Trump-2.jpg&description=In%20New%20Tweet%2C%20Donald%20Trump%20Falsely%20Blames%20Obama%20For%20Violent%20Gitmo%20Detainees%20Released%20Under%20Bush", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://t.co/y9jb420fFZ", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fdonald-trump-falsely-blames-obama-for-violent-gitmo-detainees-released-under-bush%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/839084268991229952"], "published": "2017-03-07T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:14:58.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
