Read More Madison and Louise were summoned to the head's office (Photo: BBC) Madison sent a text to Louise to warn her to not say a word (Photo: BBC) The date on Louise's phone was a month behind (Photo: BBC) \nPreviously, Alexandra and Madison had told a boy Bex sleeps with anyone, following her 'leaked photo' ordeal with former boyfriend Shakil. \nSo far, fairly perilous stuff. But some nosy viewers, forgetting the show is a fictional set up, got worked up because of an error over the date. \nLouise and Madison were waiting outside the head's office for a telling off, and Madison texted Louise saying: \"Remember, say nothing.\" \nA close up shot of Louise's phone revealed - for anyone keen on screen-grabbing or pausing live TV - that the date was listed as Friday 17 February, and not Friday 17 March. You would absolutely do what Madison says, wrong day and all (Photo: BBC) Louise: Just as puzzled as everyone else (Photo: BBC) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T17:12:33.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
