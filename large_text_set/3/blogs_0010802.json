Mar 13 MDP Statement on CBO Report Showing GOP Health Care Repeal Will Increase Uninsured by 24 Million FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE News from the Michigan Democratic Party Monday, March 13, 2017 Contact: Paul Kanan, 517.371.5410 ; pkanan@michigandems.com MDP Statement on CBO Report Showing GOP Health Care Repeal Will Increase Uninsured by 24 Million LANSING — The Michigan Democratic Party released the following statement today, on behalf of Party Chair Brandon Dillon, regarding the Congressional Budget Office report showing 24 million Americans would be without health insurance under the Republican proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act: “The 24 million people who will lose coverage, and the countless others who will see their health care costs skyrocket, are not just a faceless number, no matter how Republicans in Congress and Donald Trump prefer to look at them,” said Brandon Dillon, Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. “These are real people — working men and women, seniors, and children — who will bear the burden of the Republican plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, all so Donald Trump, his wealthy friends, and insurance company CEOs get another massive tax giveaway. This plan, supported by Michigan Republicans like Mike Bishop, Dave Trott, Tim Walberg, and Fred Upton, is not only reckless and irresponsible, it’s malicious and immoral.” ###", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:01:20.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
