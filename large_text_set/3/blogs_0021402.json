On Tuesday, Trump signed a bill allocating $19.5 billion to NASA for a crewed mission to Mars, deep space, and the investigation of Jupiter’s moon Europa. NASA hopes to send astronauts to Mars by 2030.

Advertisement \nDays ago, the administration proposed major budget cuts for the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and, within NASA, the elimination of its education program and cuts in climate change research. The bill cuts NASA’s Earth Science program by about $100 million. \nHowever, when it comes to deep space, Trump sees an opportunity to leave a legacy. At Tuesday’s signing, he referenced the historic Apollo 11 mission to the Moon, saying, “Now, this nation is ready to be the first in space once again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:04:55.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
