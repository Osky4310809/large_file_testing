It actually broke our top 10 of all time.” said Justin Shunkwyler, GM for Gordon Biersch. \nThe festival is expanding to nine nights across two weekends – from March 31 through April 8 – and will extend to eight neighborhoods. \nLighting up Hampden, Hamilton-Lauraville, Station North, Little Italy, Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello, Waverly, Sandtown-Winchester, and Greater Mondawmin. \n“This is a great opportunity to showcase our city to bring press from around the nation to look at Baltimore and to see it in a different light,” said Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh. \n“This year, I kind of know what to expect a little bit more, so I’ll be better staffed and prepared for it that way,” said Shunkwyler. “But we’re ready for it and we’re really excited to have it again this year.” \nAll of the activities are free and open to the public. Light City will open and close with a bang, by holding a parade on the first night and a fireworks show for the festival finale. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook Amy Yensi Amy Yensi joined WJZ Eyewitness News in March 2015 as a general assignment reporter.
