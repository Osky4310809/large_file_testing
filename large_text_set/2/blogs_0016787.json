King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 11 hours ago 4 \nMicajah Ryan, the man who worked as an engineer on such classic albums as GN'R's \" Appetite for Destruction ,\" Megadeth's \" Rust in Peace \" and \" Countdown to Extinction ,\" revealed that Dave Jerden was briefly hired as the second producer of RiP, but was quickly fired, seemingly for being named Dave. \nSome of the notable production efforts under Jerden's belt include Alice in Chains' \" Facelift ,\" \" Sap ,\" and \" Dirt ,\" along with The Offspring's \" Americana ,\" RHCP's \" Mother's Milk ,\" (mixing only) and more. \nAnyhow, Micajah revealed on The Double Stop Podcast that he was brought into the 'Deth fold by RiP co-producer Mike Clink, who was pulling a double duty with Megadeth and Guns N' Roses at the time. \nAnother guy Clink brought in was Dave Jerden, but that didn't last long. \nDiscussing how Clink left Dave Mustaine and co. in the middle of recording to work with GN'R, the engineer noted: \n\"[Mustaine] and Mike decided to hire Dave Jerden to come in and produce [the album]. Dave came in and after a few days, Dave Mustaine, the quote was, 'I think there's too many guys named Dave around here, we're gonna get rid of one of them.' And Dave Jerden got fired. So, yeah... \n\"That's weird, 'cause Dave Jerden is a genius. When it comes to making a record, that guy knows what he's doing, there's no question about that. I think what happened was that he didn't want to be boxed in by using what Mike had recorded - bass and drums - he wanted to go somewhere else with it. I think he felt kind of constrained, and that was the deciding factor.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:43:07.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
