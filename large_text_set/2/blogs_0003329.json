We want to get it over 51, right? At least 51.”\nRelated: CNN captures Donald Trump watching a blaring television on Air Force One instead of doing his job \nHe then proceeded to ramble for approximately 12 minutes about great Black people are and even managed to mention the names of few famous African Americans from history before going off on a tangent about fake news.\nNow, let’s take a look at some of the quotes…\nOn Black History Month: \nWell, this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together. Hi, Lynn, how are you? Just a few notes. During this month, we honor the tremendous history of African-Americans throughout our country. Throughout the world, if you really think about it, right?\nOn Ben Carson, who, so far, is the only Black person on Trump’s cabinet: \nI want to thank Ben Carson, who’s gonna be heading up HUD. That’s a big job. That’s a job that’s not only housing, but it’s mind and spirit. Right, Ben? And you understand, nobody’s gonna be better than Ben.\nOn the Martin Luther King, Jr. bust in the White House: \nYou read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office. It turned out that that was fake news. Fake news! The statue is cherished.\nOn the National Museum of African American History and Culture: \nI am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things.\nOn Fredrick Douglass, the abolitionist who died in 1895: \nFrederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I noticed.\nOn other important Civil Rights figures: \nHarriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. Big impact.\nOn the media: \nI don’t watch CNN, so I don’t get to see you as much as I used to. I don’t like watching fake news. But Fox has treated me very nice. Wherever Fox is, thank you.\nOn all those impoverished Black neighborhoods in America: \nWe’re gonna need better schools and we need them soon. We need more jobs, we need better wages, a lot better wages. We’re gonna work very hard on the inner city. Ben is gonna be doing that, big league.\nOn his appeal to African-American voters: \nIf you remember, I wasn’t going to do well with the African-American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting—and I won’t go into details—but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years.\nOn reality star Omarosa Manigault: \nOmarosa’s actually a very nice person. Nobody knows that. I don’t want to destroy her reputation, but she’s a very good person, and she’s been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign, and I appreciate it. I really do. Very special.\n’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:23:04.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
