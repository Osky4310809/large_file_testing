For Sunday's InStyle Golden Globes afterparty , Selena chose a vaguely boho, ethereal off-the-shoulder white gown from J. Mendel. But last night? Selena did a complete style 180. \nWith the help of her stylist, Kate Young, Selena selected a long, red leather Louis Vuitton dress to attend the Sixth Biennial UNICEF Ball in Los Angeles. Far from appearing heavy, the dress seemed relatively weightless thanks to floral cutout details and a ruffle around the neck. \nWhile at the event, Selena made the rounds and said hello to some of her very stylish friends, including new face of Louis Vuitton Léa Seydoux and designer Nicolas Ghesquière. Louis Vuitton and UNICEF are partnering together for charitable initiatives, a union Selena celebrated in an Instagram snap she posted last night. \"So happy @LouisVuitton and @NicolasGhesquiere are partnering with @UNICEF,\" she wrote. \"I've been an ambassador since I was 17, met Nicolas last year. SO grateful for the worlds to collide for a great cause.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:57:20.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
