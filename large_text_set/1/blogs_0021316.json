Jan 24, 2017 6:33 PM \nCYA MODE Jan 24, 2017 6:34 PM \nThey lied on the injury report. \nFine them a draft pick. \nEither that or tell the world that Bell is made out of glass. dickson29 says: Jan 24, 2017 6:36 PM \nWith all of the talent he has, what value does Bell bring to any team if he can not play due to suspensions, injuries or being SOFT? infectorman says: Jan 24, 2017 6:40 PM \nIf the opposition thinks it going to get a healthy/steady does of Bell, then they gameplan their D a certain way. NE had no expectation of an even slightly less than 100% Leveon Bell. \nTherein lies the fraud. \nWhy DID Bell miss practices recently? They state it’s not injury related, but how would any opposing team know if they’re telling the truth? Answer is,they wouldn’t know. \nNE likely didn’t prepare for Williams to play much, if at all. Not that it mattered, but in many other scenarios with different tailbacks on different teams, it could easily catch an opposing defense off-guard and force them to scramble to adjust with their defensive personnel and schemes. \nAhh, but it’s happened against New England, so Fraudger won’t give a hoot. Pretty sketchy, the whole thing greenlargo says: Jan 24, 2017 6:40 PM \nIn their effort to downplay it they just admitted there was an injury they knew about. That should have been on the report. \nBut who cares really? If the league needs to make a small point throw in a small fine. A draft pick would be overkill. \nAnd also whatever they do to Pittsburgh and Seatyle should be exactly the same. \nIMHO what they do to Pittsburgh and Seattle should be exactly the same as what they did to Indy for not disvlosing Andrew Luck’s ribs. (Nothing) harrisonhits2 says: Jan 24, 2017 6:41 PM \nIt doesn’t matter if it wasn’t serious it still needs to be reported. Should be a fine to Tomlin and one to tbe team Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
