After reveling in the company's successes with Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story , he turned his attention to the upcoming Star Wars: The Last Jedi . \nSpeaking to the crowd, Iger said in no uncertain terms that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a \" perfect chapter \" of the saga. This came after talking about how topping the success of The Force Awakens was a monumental task; but apparently, director Rian Johnson and Co. have done that (and then some?). Iger later added that, as one of the few people in the world who has seen the film, \" I can promise you it's worth the wait .\" \nIt's easy to hear Disney's CEO praising one of their biggest films of 2017 and think that it's towing the company line and nothing more. However, Iger (who later confirmed he is one of the few people in the world who has actually seen the film), is not known for trivial wordplay. He didn't say Last Jedi is a \"great film,\" or even the more hyperbolic \"better than Force Awakens .\" He called it a \"perfect chapter,\" knowing full well what kind of weight that statement will have with fans. \nSo, will Star Wars: The Last Jedi live up to that claim? Hopefully a first teaser trailer will begin to offer us answer, soon. \nAre you excited for the next entry in the Skywalker Saga?
