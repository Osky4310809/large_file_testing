They plug directly into the MoVI Pro with Freefly-supplied motor cables and work with any properly geared lens. Extreme sports Director/Cinematographer Ty Evans Using Redrock Torque motors on MoVI \nThe motors share the same design DNA as the MoVI Pro, with a relentless focus on light-weight and ultra-compact design for longer run times and easier handling. \nRedrock is introducing two bundles: a 1-Motor kit for focus and a 3-Motor kit for focus, iris, and zoom. They are available now from Redrock Micro's website for $695 per motor. Post 1 Comment \nI ask you sorry, I'll go off topic as hell because my sense of frustration of those days. I own the old canon 7D thas has not bult in autofocus and I have absolutely no money for a new camera. I also invested in 7D making it good for raw video (I bought vaf filter) and a new 128gb fast compact flash. I need to buy a gimbal to increase my chance to find jobs but gimbal without an autofocus camera is a very bad idea because manual focus people say it'is impossible. So I need to buy a wireless follow focus if I want to use my camera with a gimbal. The problem is that a remote follow focus have very very high prices so I will not buy it and neither the gimbal (because I'm basically poor and I can't afford it despite I struggle with investment and austerity). So I beg gimbal producers to make an affordable kit (gimbal included remote follow focus) at max 800 euro all included. If someone who can make this exist please knock once.
