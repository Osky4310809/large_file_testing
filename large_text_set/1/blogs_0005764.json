But unless Pixar releases teases us with a little more about the plot with a third trailer, it looks like we’re all going to have to wait until June 16 to find out what will really happen to McQueen. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T04:22:48.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
