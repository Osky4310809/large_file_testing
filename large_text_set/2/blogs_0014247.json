My mom went to Penn State in the 80’s when The Dance Marathon was held in Rec Hall and 500 students raised just over $300,000. My dad was a local musician who played at THON well into the 1990s with his band the Screaming Ducks. But, it wasn’t until 2009 that I attended my first THON, following my own cancer diagnosis in the summer of 2008, at the age of 10. \nI was diagnosed with Burkitt’s lymphoma, a form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. While no cancer diagnosis could be seen as fortunate, I was lucky because we caught it early. My mom noticed a lump in my neck the night before the last day of school of my fourth grade year. Soon after, the doctors surgically removed it, thinking it was just a reactive lymph node. Then we got the call that it was something more. The treatment, although intense (I had as much chemotherapy in three months as a Leukemia patient receives in five years) my treatment lasted just three months. Burkitt’s lymphoma is the most aggressive human cancer, with tumors that can double in size in 48 hours. What we learned, though, was that aggressive cancers tend to respond the best to treatment, and Burkitt’s lymphoma has a very high cure rate (almost 90 percent). \nMost of the “sickness” I felt came from the chemotherapy. These are powerful drugs that kill the cancer, but take all of the good cells along with it. I lost my hair and had terrible sores in my mouth and near constant nausea. Through the support of my family and friends, the expertise of the doctors and staff at the Penn State Hershey Children’s Hospital, and the Four Diamonds Fund, things went quite well overall. \nI remember hearing about THON from people in my community — a boy from one of my baseball teams, student teachers who had participated in THON as dancers. But, nothing can really prepare you for experiencing it first hand, like my family did. When you actually receive the support — the gas and meal vouchers for travel to and from the hospital, being adopted by a student organization, taking part in the family activities at THON, you really begin to see the impact that this support has on the families. \nMy first time attending THON was a few months after my chemo was concluded. My family was adopted by Beta Sigma Beta and Kappa Delta’s THON org. Since we were local, we were able to go back and forth between the event and our house. That way, we’d spend some time there with our dancers, head home for a little bit, and then go back. Of course, with all the people on the dance floor, we always had to stick together in order to avoid getting separated. Nonetheless, I can recall tossing bouncy balls back and forth with dancers on the floor, and participating in organized activities like riding horseback with the equestrian team, visiting the blue band building and moving with the men’s gymnastics team. \nThis year, I’m returning for the first time in a few years, not only on my own for the first time, but also as a member of the OGC THON org, which includes members of the Glee Club and Oriana Singers. Though this year, it’ll be a new experience. Instead of just being on the floor with my family and a bunch of people generally much older than me, I’ll be there with my peers, as well close friends who are dancing for the full marathon, including Tim Gilpatrick, a friend from high school, and the Collegian’s own Gabby Santoliquito. \nAdditionally, being on my own schedule, without my parents worrying about keeping us all harnessed together will be nice, and the freedom of being able to mill around solo will allow me to participate more, with my friends and with the kids, and I’ll probably save a lot of time without the whole round-up phase before we can try to move five feet. \nDuring my treatment, at my age it was hard to follow any of the financial challenges of such a task, but I’ve since learned how much Four Diamonds actually helped my family. Operations and drugs that could have cost us a fortune, cost us nothing. That was all because of the money that was raised for the foundation. It wasn’t until I got older that I really learned about how Four Diamonds helped my family during that time — automatically covering everything that insurance didn’t as well as social workers, and others who helped us as we traveled back and forth to Hershey that summer. \nBut if there’s one thing I want everybody to recognize about this weekend, it’s that the kids really don’t care how much money we raise. I’m telling you this from the shoes of fifth grader who’s been there. I didn’t care if we went from $100 to $200, or $1,000 to $10,000. Really, once you got to a certain number of digits, I was pretty much impressed no matter what. The reality is that the kids are there to have fun, have attention and feel the overwhelming power of love and support this university is banding together to offer them. \nThis weekend is about the kids, above all else. We raise money for the families throughout the year, which is an amazing thing and something I can now fully recognize for the benefits it provides the families with. But this weekend isn’t about the money. It isn’t about beating last year’s numbers, or our record. It isn’t about beating other orgs at raising money. It’s about beating cancer. \nKids don’t always look at the big picture, let alone try to comprehend the sheer size of the picture. But they know what love feels like. Give them that, and that’ll make THON what it’s meant to be for them. Every kid there, whether they’re on treatment, off treatment, or even just a brother or a sister, is there to have fun. Because you know what? Their lives might not be all that great right now. But together, we can all help to change that. Reach out. Approach them. Play with them. Dance with them. Give them something to smile about. Ignite your hope within and be a beacon of light in their dark world. That’s what it’s about, because they’re what it’s about.
