Jenner posted a series of tweets disavowing a now-deleted post and saying she would no longer personally post on her app. If you think she was personally posting on her app before this non-troversy, I have a beach house I can sell you in Idaho.We suspect it was one detailing how she maintains a happy relationship with the \"Rack City\" rapper, but of course that's rank speculation based on our (my) extensive experience in rankly speculating about America's first family. Hey guys from now on I won't be posting personally on my app anymore... — Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) January 3, 2017 Advertisement a post went up today quoting something that I NEVER EVER said or saw. A very personal post that I would never ever approve. — Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) January 3, 2017 And it's unfair to me and you to think that those were my words.I'm sorry and I know we will figure somethng out so we can all be satisfied — Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) January 3, 2017 Love You — Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) January 3, 2017 The post in question wasn't exactly steamy.
