Sidenote. We have already shared our concerns about these misleading definitions in our recent article: “Rethinking Long Tail Keywords: how to get TONS of traffic from ‘unpopular’ search queries” But real data is always better than just an opinion, right? \nIn fact, we also studied the “popularity” of each length group, by summing up the search volumes of all keywords in it. \nAnd got this: \nSo it looks like there’s no specific length that would drastically outperform all others. The “Long Tail” of the “Search Demand Curve” \nThe term “long-tail keywords” comes from the “long tail” of the so-called “search demand curve.” \nIn raw data from our 1.4 billion database, that search demand curve looks like this: \nIn the “head” of the curve, we have a few keywords with an extremely high search volume. But they hardly account for even 10% of all searches. Sidenote. In case you’re wondering, those two 100M + keywords are “youtube” and “facebook.” \nAnd at the “tail” of the curve, we have a monstrous pile of keywords with miserable search volume. But they account for almost 40% of all searches. \nTo actually see this long tail on a graph, we need to plot all our keywords on the X-axis in the order of decreasing monthly search volume. \nThe real graph wouldn’t look very pretty because of its scale, so we’ve created a slightly modified visual representation instead: How to take advantage of the long tail \nSo roughly around 40% of all searches are coming from billions of long-tail keywords that have less than 50 searches per month. \nThere should be a way to use this to your advantage, right? \nWell, there is such a way! \nLook at this page, which ranks #3 for the keyword “website traffic”: \nThe search volume of the keyword “website traffic” is almost 10,000 searches per month. So if you rank #3 for it, you can expect about 10% of that traffic at best, which is only 1,000 visitors per month. \nBut Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer shows that this page is bringing almost 7,000 visitors per month. And this traffic is generated by nearly 600 keywords that it ranks for in organic search results. \nThat is long-tail traffic in all its glory. \nLet’s put the URL of this page in Site Explorer and see all these long-tail keywords that it ranks for: \nIt looks like people invent hundreds of peculiar ways to ask pretty much the same question. Google understands it and ranks exactly the same page for all these search queries. \nSo by looking at the search volume of an individual keyword, you can’t make a good prediction of the total search traffic potential of your page. You have to examine the top-ranking pages and see how much search traffic they are generating from long tail. \nThe same principle applies to researching the keywords your competitors rank for. \nIf you look at the best keywords that send traffic to IncomeDiary.com, you probably wouldn’t pay attention to the keyword “how do websites make money” because it has only 800 searches per month: \nBut if you look at which pages send them the most traffic from search, you’ll see this: \nThis page is bringing them a ton of highly targeted search traffic, all because of the numerous long-tail keywords it ranks for. Think long tail \nI’m pretty sure that most of the takeaways from our research didn’t come as a surprise for you. They’re quite intuitive, after all. \nBut, at the same time, I see way too many people overlooking the power of long tail and focusing on search volumes of individual keywords (as if it’s 2010). \nSo let me know if you had an “ AHA ” moment while reading this post, and if you’re now going to rethink your SEO strategy with long-tail keywords in mind.
