He isn’t short on inspiration as he attempts to go out a state champion at 138 pounds. \nHarvey finished fifth at 113 pounds as a sophomore and fifth again as a junior at 120, and has been a witness to history in his time as a Cowboy. For three years he was teammates with TJ Shelton, who last February became the 19th wrestler in Colorado history to win four state titles. \nShelton’s accomplishments, along with titles by grad Devon Pontine at 182 and current senior Casey Turner at 152, gave the Cowboys 59 total individual champions, tied for third-most all-time. The Cowboys also took home the team title by one point over Rocky Ford , earning Meeker its seventh championship. \n“Both TJ and Devon were really good role models,” Harvey said. “They pushed us the last three years and led by example, and I think they saw success because of that. I’ve thought a lot about what they did, especially Devon, who finally won a title after coming up short a few times like me, and it’s pushed me mentally this season.” \nFast forward to this year’s tournament, and seven of Meeker’s nine qualifiers advanced to Friday night’s semifinals, including Sheridan (31-3) who defeated Sedgwick County /Fleming junior Kobryn Mann 7-3 in the quarterfinals. The Cowboys (72 points) held the lead after the quarterfinals in the team competition, with Rocky Ford (70.5) right on their heels. \nBut beyond the obvious history out on the mat that’s driving Harvey, the memory of his late younger brother is equally as crucial. Angelo Harvey was just 7 years old when he passed away from injuries sustained in an ATV accident in the summer of 2013. His influence, along with beams of support in the Cowboys’ practice room, has propelled Harvey to the cusp of high school wrestling immortality. \n“That was super hard, but now I think he pushes me and motivates me. I’m wrestling for both of us, in a sense, because I feel him every time I’m out there.” Harvey said. “Plus, the brotherhood I have in the room at Meeker is big. I’ve got a handful of buddies in there that I battle during practice, but then after practice, they’re still there to help you and support you. To have a safe zone where I could go, that helped me a lot.” \nAnd while other Meeker wrestlers also look to pad the program’s championship pedigree — Turner is gunning for a second title at 170 this year, while sophomore Tannen Kennedy (36-8 at 126), senior Hunter Garcia (25-12 at 152), senior Chase Rule (27-6 at 182), senior Caleb Bradford (31-11 at 220) and senior Tyler Ilgen (28-9 at 285) were all scheduled to wrestle in the semis — sixth-year coach JC Watt noted this year’s Cowboys saved their best wrestling for the Pepsi Center.
