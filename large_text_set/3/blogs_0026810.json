Have something you want discussed? . This week’s topic: you’re here — are you staying? Census data is out for 2016 and Wayne County is #2 in the country for population loss. Between July 1, 2015 and July 1, 2016, Wayne County lost 7,696 residents. While births outnumbered deaths, the number of residents who moved out came in at 17,346, while people moving in totaled 4,279. Chicago’s Cook County is once again the county with the steepest decline. Last year, we asked about moving to Detroit , and many enthusiastically discussed their experiences. We’d like to know if anyone is thinking about moving away. So many residential properties are being built and developers are banking on this energy — is it here to stay? If you are thinking about moving, what are your reasons? Taxes, insurance, safety, schools, jobs? Tell us what you think in the comments below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:07:18.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
