Most inspired by the beauty phenomenon, it turns out, were brides — they’ve since been pinning lip masks like crazy to get their pouts in perfect shape for the big day.\nIn fact, according to Pinterest’s 2017 wedding report, lip masks have been pinned 388% more this year than in 2016, a testament to the truly undeniable power of Korean beauty and skin care products.\npin \nThere are tons of brands making these collagen lip masks. To use one, you basically just stick it to your lips for about 15-20 minutes, and then peel it off to reveal — hopefully — softer and slightly plumper lips. It seemed to work for Stone, who looked radiant at the Globes.\nA post shared by Rachel Goodwin (@rachel_goodwin) on Jan 8, 2017 at 5:31pm PST \nSelf magazine writer Haley Goldberg gave Stone’s lip mask a try — it’s by KNC Beauty — and reported that her pout was “lush AF” after the treatment. Racked writer Cheryl Wischhover tried the product, too, and said that of the three masks she test drove, the KNC Beauty version left her lips feeling most moisturized and smelled the best.\npin \nYou can get a five-pack of KNC’s collagen lip mask here , for $24.99. \nIf you want to test out other lip mask options, there’s also this one, by Tony Moly. pin \nGet a five-pack here for $12.98. \nAnd there’s this pomegranate collagen lip mask from Skinfood, too. pin \nGet it here for $4. \nNot to mention the loads of other options floating around Pinterest.
