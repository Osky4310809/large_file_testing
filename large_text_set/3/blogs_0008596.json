But as they carried on with their trip to the nation's capital, could they now go from a terrifying plane incident to a tournament title? \n\"We had a conversation after everything went down, but once we landed down in D.C., I think we all agreed on why can't this be one of the greatest stories ever told?\" Michigan guard Zak Irvin said following the Wolverines' first Big Ten Tournament since 1998 - though that title was later vacated. \n\"I think everyone had that mentality - just why not us? And I think that it just pushed us through when we were tired, fatigued - whatever it might be - and that was the extra push that we needed to win this championship.\" \nAmber Searls-USA TODAY Sports \nAmber Searls-USA TODAY Sports \nUnderstandably, the team's plane skidding off the runway put life into perspective, but once everyone safely arrived in D.C., they switched gears back to winning games just like it was any other distraction. \n\"When the event first happened, basketball was the last thing that was on my mind,\" said Derrick Walton Jr., who was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. \n\"I talked to Zak (when) we got home, and I just said like, 'Basketball is a small spectrum in life - what we just experienced.' I just let him know what really could have happened. But once we got here, I just let that all be what it was.\" \nAs a No. 7 seed in the Midwest region of the NCAA Tournament, the Wolverines will open against No. 10 Oklahoma State on Friday in Indianapolis.
