After acquiring Pebble last month , the company has now also bought the UK-based smartwatch maker Vector Watch, which was founded in 2015.\nVector Watch is best known for making great looking smartwatches like the Vector Luna and Vector Meridian, which feature a monochrome screen display, a fully stainless steel case, an impressive 30-day battery life, and are compatible with all the major mobile operating systems including Android. The smartwatches also come in a variety of colors and are water resistant up to 50 meters.\nSee also: Fitbit to build its own app store ‘as soon as possible,’ a smartwatch in the works? 3 days ago In a blog post, the company announced that its smartwatches will continue to function, but won’t receive any new software updates from now on. Developers are not able to develop new streams for the devices, however, they can still edit the ones they have already published.\nThe company’s support team will continue to respond to questions customers might have, and the warranty for the smartwatches is obviously still valid. Financial details of the deal were not announced.\nWe won’t see any more Vector-branded smartwatches on the market, but the team behind the company will join Fitbit and start creating new products that will hopefully hit the market soon. These will most likely be sold under the Fitbit brand, which is already well known in the wearables market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T15:33:57.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
