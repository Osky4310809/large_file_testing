Meanwhile, the Citizens are set to lock Jadon Sancho up to a new deal. According to Calciomercato.com , Kean's agent, Mino Raiola, has been negotiating with Turin with an eye on the player's future, and while the Bianconeri remain optimistic the teenager will stay with the club, Ajax are still lurking. Il BiancoNero (h/t Calciomercato ) previously reported both City and Arsenal are keeping a close eye on negotiations and are hopeful of landing the 17-year-old, who is widely regarded as one of the top talents in his age group. As shared by Squawka Football, Kean has announced himself to the world in a big way this season: Squawka Football @Squawka Happy 17th birthday to Moise Kean! â€¢ First Serie A player born in 2000. ðŸ‘¶ â€¢ First Champions League player born in 2000. ðŸ‘¶ Massive future. https://t.co/108pOBYAog 2/28/2017, 2:55:00 PM The teen starlet has been a standout in the Juventus youth setup for years, consistently scoring against opponents two or three years older than him. He combines raw speed and power with great instincts and finishing ability, drawing comparisons to compatriot Mario Balotelli. Unlike Super Mario, Kean seems to have a good head on his shouldersâ€•despite limited opportunities on the senior level, he hasn't spoken out about his return to the primavera. Here's a look at some of his highlights: Ajax's reputation for talent development means the Dutch giants will always present an intriguing destination for players like Kean, and with Raiola, anything is possible. A loan move seems more likely at this point. Kean has yet to sign a contract with Juventus, leaving the door open for Arsenal and City, but for now, he's still expected to stay in Turin. Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images One youngster who is expected to make an impact for the Citizens is Sancho, who is set to sign a new three-year deal amid interest from Chelsea and Arsenal. According to the Daily Mail 's Ian Ladyman (h/t Daily Mirror 's Aaron Flanagan ), the former Watford man will receive a serious increase in wages. Per the report, Tottenham Hotspur , Chelsea and the Gunners were hoping to bring the 16-year-old to London amid rumours he felt homesick in the north of the country. Here's a look at some of his highlights: City manager Pep Guardiola has prioritised youth since moving to the Etihad Stadium, signing a whole bunch of talents during the summer. Investing in the academy would be in line with that philosophy, so this move shouldn't come as a surprise.
