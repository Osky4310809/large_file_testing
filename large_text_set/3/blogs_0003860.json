both of the designs serve as genuine ‘counter-spaces’ in lefebvre’s terms’, explains studio evren başbuğ . ‘footbridge and sunset lounge, both promise a new urban space to experience different forms of ‘idleness’, by employing the social, geographical and historical backgrounds of this unique location. these new coastal interventions also fit perfectly with the ‘easy way of living’ vision established for the city of i̇zmir, by ‘i̇zmirsea’ coastal regeneration project.’ \nthe bridge allows the passage of small boats underneath and provides access to the pontoon located in the creek \nbostanlı sunset lounge is composed of a set of similar thermo-wood covered platforms \nthe volumes define a public leisure and attraction point in a sensitive relation with its environment \nthe structure has been designed with an asymmetrical cross-section \nseveral cascading thermo-wood surfaces installed on a steel frame allow users to enjoy the view of the bay \nthe project aims to revitalize the waterfront area \ndiagram of the installation’s relationship to the setting sun \ndiagram \n\n\ndesignboom has received this project from our ‘ DIY submissions ‘ feature, where we welcome our readers to submit their own work for publication. see more project submissions from our readers here. \n\nedited by: peter corboy | designboom ozsteb", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:54:44.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
