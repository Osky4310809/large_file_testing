If everything just went like that without a problem, well, you don’t need politicians to do these jobs.” \n  Mr. Trump, who ran for office as the antithesis of a conventional politician, smiled at that line. It was one of his only smiles during a news conference in which he demanded that America’s NATO allies pay back “vast sums of money from past years” and vowed that the United States would no longer be out-negotiated on trade deals by Germany . “Right now, I would say that the negotiators for Germany have done a far better job than the negotiators for the United States,” Mr. Trump said. “But hopefully we can even it out.” Video Trump to Merkel: ‘At Least We Have Something in Common’ President Trump held his first meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at the White House on Friday. At a subsequent press briefing, he was asked about recent wiretapping claims and made a joke that seemingly referred to reports that the United States had bugged Ms. Merkel's phone during the Obama administration.

As a member of the European Union , it delegates that authority to Brussels. As for NATO, she said Germany had committed to boosting its military spending, but noted that the alliance had other vital missions, like security and development in Africa. \n  Ms. Merkel has consciously avoided becoming Mr. Trump’s adversary. She dismissed efforts in Germany to portray her as a bulwark against his populist movement. Mr. Trump was harshly critical of Ms. Merkel during the campaign for allowing refugees into Germany, but he has moderated his words since taking office. He welcomed the chancellor to the White House for a full schedule of events that included an Oval Office meeting, lunch and a round-table discussion with German and American chief executives. Still, both leaders advocated unapologetically for their worldviews. Mr. Trump appeared to go further than he has in the past on the need for burden-sharing in NATO. He demanded not just that members increase their military spending as a percentage of gross domestic product, but also that they make reparations for past American contributions. \n  “Many nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States,” he said. “These nations must pay what they owe.” Mr. Trump also said he believed that Germany, like China and other trading partners, had taken advantage of the United States. “It’s not exactly good for our workers,” he said, adding that they had been “screwed.” The president said his “America First” approach had begun reversing that trend, luring factories back to Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states that had lost manufacturing jobs to foreign countries. \nAdvertisement Though Mr. Trump did not mention his executive order banning travel from six predominantly Muslim countries, he did say that “immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.” \n  Ms. Merkel offered a vision of what she called “open-minded” globalization. Refugees, she said, needed opportunities to improve their lives, in part to stabilize their countries and prevent them from sliding into civil war. She extolled freedom of movement as one of the great strengths of the European Union. Germany’s success, she said, was inextricably tied to the success of the European Union. Video Merkel’s Playbook for Trump Angela Merkel and Donald Trump couldn't be more different. They disagree on immigration, NATO, the European Union and trade. As they meet for the first time as world leaders, here are the factors that may shape their relationship. By AINARA TIEFENTHÄLER on Publish Date March 16, 2017. Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images.
