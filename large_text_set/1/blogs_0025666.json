Claudia Cruz/CNET \nGooglers are speaking out. \nEmployees at the search giant came out en masse on Monday to protest President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. The walkout included more than 2,000 Google workers from campuses around the world. On Twitter, #GooglersUnite was the battle cry. \nThe protest was a response to an executive order Trump signed last Friday that, among other things, temporarily banned immigration from predominantly Muslim seven countries. \nCEO Sundar Pichai, who was born in India, and cofounder Sergey Brin, an immigrant and refugee from Russia, joined the protest. Brin also went to a protest at San Francisco airport on Saturday night. \n\"I'm glad to see that energy here today and around the world to know that people are fighting for what's right out there,\" Brin said on Monday, according to Forbes . \nSeveral tech companies, including Facebook, Apple and Airbnb , have spoken out against the order, but Google's protest seems to be the sharpest rebuke from Silicon Valley. \nEarlier in the day, Google announced a $4 million crisis fund to support immigration causes . And last Friday, after the order was signed, Pichai reportedly sent a memo to employees affected by the ban to cut overseas trips short and return to the US. \nA source familiar said the protest was organized by employees but supported by the company.
