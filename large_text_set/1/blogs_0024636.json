If it qualifies, it could trigger a vote on whether the most populous US state should become a separate nation. As RT reports, the group behind the proposal, Yes California Independence Campaign, was cleared on Thursday by Californian Secretary of State Alex Padilla to begin the bid to collect some 600,000 voter signatures required to put the ambitious plan on the ballot, AP reported. \nThe initiative would ask voters to repeal part of the state constitution that declares California an “inseparable part of the United States of America.” \n\nBeing a US state is “no longer serving California’s best interests,” the movement claims. \n\n“ Not only is California forced to subsidize this massive military budget with our taxes, but Californians are sent off to fight in wars that often do more to perpetuate terrorism than to abate it. The only reason terrorists might want to attack us is because we are part of the United States and are guilty by association. Not being a part of that country will make California a less likely target of retaliation by its enemies,” the campaign argues, among other things. \n\n“America already hates California, and America votes on emotions,” Marcus Evans, vice-president of Yes California told to the Los Angeles Times. \n\n“I think we'd have the votes today if we held it,” he added. \nIt must submit the valid voter signatures by July 25 to qualify for the November 2018 ballot. \nThe number of Californians who would rather see their state a sovereign nation than part of the United States jumped to 32 percent, a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed earlier this week. In 2014, it was only 20 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T02:15:03.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
