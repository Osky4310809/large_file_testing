These include extensive leaks, damp and mould, staircases that have come away from walls, broken heating systems, inadequate fire-proofing and absent insulation. Local people are also concerned about alleged high levels of methane and hydrogen sulphide, which some claim may have had a direct impact on their health. \nThe Clarion Group was founded in November last year, after a merger between the Circle Housing Group – which was responsible for Orchard Village, as well as around 63,000 other homes in London and across England – and the housing association Affinity Sutton. Despite the problems at Orchard Village, Clarion is aiming to build another 50,000 flats and houses over the next 10 years, with the aid of a £1.1bn fund to buy land, and is in talks to put up another 500 homes in Havering alone. \nBoth Circle’s growth over the last 15 years and this latest move reflect a general trend within housing, whereby traditionally community-based, philanthropic housing associations are becoming increasingly large and commercially-minded, something now being accelerated by government funding cuts and deregulation. \nMeanwhile, pressure to alleviate the shortage of housing remains considerable. The government’s white paper on the subject, published on Tuesday, will reiterate the government’s commitment to building a million new homes in England by 2020. On Sunday housing minister Gavin Barwell said that housing associations would form part of the government’s strategy to break the stranglehold of a handful of large developers. \nClarion Housing is at the heart of the Orchard Village controversy, along with the building giant Willmott Dixon, the Greater London authority and Havering council, and the official housing regulator, the Homes and Communities Agency, which is accused by local residents and politicians of major failures. \nIn January, Phil Martin, a local Ukip councillor, told a meeting of Havering council that the lives of Orchard Village’s residents “have been blighted by the substandard building work that has taken place” and that “the only solution is its demolition and complete reconstruction”. \nThe local MP, Labour’s Jon Cruddas, said the case “graphically exposes some of the modern forces in the housing association sector which could undermine its traditional role, as it becomes less interested in the needs of residents, and more interested in aggressive development”. \nHe said “the amount of casework generated by this one estate is bigger than anything comparable in my time as an MP”. \nCircle has also been the subject of significant complaints about its developments in the London boroughs of Merton, Islington and Tower Hamlets. In Tower Hamlets, hundreds of residents have had problems, many of which are ongoing. Rushanara Ali, the local Labour MP, last year used a parliamentary debate to accuse Circle of “a complete failure to be locally accountable” over an array of complaints. One constituent, she said, had slipped on water leaking from her toilet when she was eight months pregnant, having reported the problem 88 times. \nOrchard Village currently contains 387 homes, the majority of which are in the social rented sector. The local campaign to address issues that go back at least four years is being led by Colin Nickless, who lives in a shared-ownership property that has been plagued with problems since he and his family moved in two-and-a-half years ago. \nNickless has a daughter with autism and cystic fibrosis who has been treated in hospital with respiratory complaints he traces directly to the state of his home. He puts the numbers of repairs to the property so far at 117. \nThe Guardian has also met local residents who have similar complaints, and seen direct evidence of the faults and defects in their homes, including floors riddled with holes, damp and mould, and faulty heating systems. These have been compounded by a widespread failure to respond to complaints. \n£12.4m in grants has been given to the development of Orchard Village by the Homes and Communities Agency. Another £18.8m has provided by the Greater London authority, which the HCA says is now solely responsible for monitoring how the money has been spent. \nWhen the Guardian contacted the GLA about the issues on the estate and how the spending of public money has been monitored, a spokesperson gave a one-line statement: “We are aware of issues regarding the construction of Orchard Village and are working closely with Havering council and Clarion Housing Group to investigate.” \nIn response to enquiries from the Guardian, a Clarion Housing Group spokesperson said that since the new organisation’s formation “its dedicated project team has already made significant progress in tackling the build defects at Orchard Village” and “made significant progress in solving issues identified by Circle Housing residents and put in place new processes to deal with repairs and maintenance in Tower Hamlets”. \nIt made reference to an “independent detailed survey of the estate” which is apparently ongoing in Orchard Village, after which “we will carry out any additional works that are required as quickly as possible, but this will take time.” The spokesperson said Clarion took local concerns about gas and hydrogen sulphide “extremely seriously”, and that the organisation had “instructed ‘ground investigation specialists’ to undertake rigorous scientific tests”. \nSome Orchard Village residents have been offered “initial compensation” payments by Clarion, which differ according to whether they own or rent their homes. People who have either bought properties or purchased a stake via a shared ownership scheme have been offered £1,000. The sum offered to some people who rent their homes, many of whom are former council tenants, is £100. \nIn a watershed move, Clarion has now confirmed that it has agreed “in principle” to buy back shared ownership and freeholder properties on the estate from residents. How it may further compensate its social housing tenants is currently unclear. \nA newsletter sent last week to residents said although Clarion was “committed to providing you with the quality home you were originally promised”, the buy-back proposal had been necessary because of “defects” that have caused “a huge amount of inconvenience and stress”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:02:36.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
