He had waited 26 long years for this, living in a sweltering, crowded, disease-ridden refugee camp along the Kenya-Somalia border that is the opposite of hope . \n  Now his worst fears are shaping up. The Somali refugees who had already been extensively vetted and approved by several American government agencies will most likely be bused back to the camps. Many said that they feared for their lives and that their situation was actually worse than it had been before they came so close to leaving. “Trump shocked us,” Mr. Ibrahim said. Most of them are now broke, having just two weeks ago given away their worldly possessions in a spree of happiness to friends less fortunate. But more worrisome, many refugees said as they gathered under the shade of a mango tree at the transit center, was the risk that they could be labeled “friends of America.” That’s a dangerous tag in a poorly policed refugee camp crawling with Islamic militants. “The Shabab will be suspicious of us,” said Deck Abdi Korriyow, another refugee, referring to the militant group that has slaughtered thousands of people across eastern Africa. “They don’t want anyone resettled to the U.S. They’ll think we’ve been giving information to the Americans.” Several men around him vigorously nodded when he added, “Who knows what will happen to us next?” Kenya is home to hundreds of thousands of Somali refugees and many are treated terribly — constantly harassed, arrested, often beaten, discriminated against, kept in large camps or locked in a soccer stadium during police roundups, and sometimes they have even disappeared . Many Kenyans see Somalia the way much of the world does: as a terrorist threat. So the refugees have set their sights on the faraway dream of America. The United States runs a vigorous resettlement program, taking in thousands of Somalis each year. Being one of them is like holding a winning lottery ticket and it generates a lot of envy. Some of the refugees said another reason they dreaded going back to the camps was because they knew some of their neighbors would barely be able to contain their glee that the resettlement had not worked out. “The people against me will be happy,” Mr. Ibrahim said. The more than 100 approved refugees here are now stuck because they don’t have proper papers to walk the streets of Nairobi. They were supposed to be walking the streets of Des Moines, Kansas City, Buffalo and St. Louis by now. They aren’t allowed to leave the transit center, which is in Nairobi’s old Indian quarter; it was supposed to be their last stop. The gate here is large and unmarked. Security is serious; many of the refugees who pass through here are hunted in their homelands. Photo Refugees at the transit center in Nairobi.

The refugees seemed bored. Somali women in full veils lay on the sidewalk on their backs. Young men lounged in a row of scratched up chairs and were not even talking to one another. \nAdvertisement When a chestnut-size mango fell from the tree, a little boy pounced on it, clearly hungry. The men spoke of “the stress.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:07:58.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
