If El Niño develops, it could have implications on the upcoming hurricane season and the overall weather pattern across North America into next winter. \nEl Niño occurs when the water temperature in the Pacific Ocean near the equator are warmer than normal for an extended period of time. \nWhile signs are pointing toward El Niño returning, it is not a guarantee. \n“Transitioning out of winter can be very difficult for the weather models to handle, so you can get misdiagnosed in the months of February, March and April especially,” AccuWeather Lead-Long Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok said. \nThis uncertainty is sometimes referred to as the \"spring barrier,\" since this time of year is when weather models that help to forecast El Niño are typically least accurate. \nHowever, confidence is slowly growing that El Niño will develop this summer. It is not expected to reach its peak until late in the fall or early winter. Even if it does develop in the summer, it may take until the fall before more significant weather impacts are seen in the U.S., according to Pastelok. \nThere can be a lag between when the ocean water temperatures climb, as El Niño develops, and the influence over the U.S. weather pattern, Pastelok said. \nEl Nino may suppress Atlantic hurricane season \nThe timing of the onset of El Niño may play a key role with how active the upcoming hurricane season is in the Atlantic Ocean. \nDuring an El Niño year, the winds at the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere are not favorable for the development of tropical system in the Atlantic hurricane basin, Pastelok said. \nThese disruptive winds can limit the number of tropical systems that develop, leading to a below-normal year. \nWith El Niño potentially developing late in the summer or early in the fall, these disruptive winds would have more of an impact on the second half of the season, decreasing the frequency of tropical systems in late-September, October and November. \n“If El Niño does come on the way that it’s showing on the weather models right now, it may shut the season off early,” Pastelok said. \nEastern United States may see a snowy winter \nThe strength of El Niño will determine the impacts that it has on the eastern U.S. \nWhile it is unlikely that another \"super El Niño\" will unfold like the pattern two winters ago, there could be a weak to moderate El Niño during the upcoming fall and winter. \nDuring a stronger El Niño, storm systems typically track across the southern U.S. and out to sea rather than tracking up the East Coast. This lowers the chance of a major winter storm, such as a nor’easter. \nHowever, if the pattern is weaker, systems may track farther north and could move up the East Coast, resulting in snow when enough cold air is present. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T07:59:06.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
