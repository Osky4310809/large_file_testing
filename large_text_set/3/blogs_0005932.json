In his own words, he is going to tell you exactly why he’ll be able to do that.\ni honestly think i can get a wolf 1 on 1 tho.\n— Feeno (@ArianFoster) March 5, 2017 See, I wasn’t joking. He’s literally going to tell you.\ni'm 230, wolfs are what, 180-200 tops? he has no thumbs. if i control his neck he's dunzo. https://t.co/j9vf2knwqI \n— Feeno (@ArianFoster) March 5, 2017 Actually, the International Wolf Center — holy s***, there’s an International Wolf Center! — says your average adult male wolf weighs about 100 or 110 pounds. However, they can get bigger than that, according to this article on the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s website. \n“Any wolf over 140 I would classify as huge,” said John Burch, a wildlife biologist with the National Park Service\nnone of them have thumbs. https://t.co/zoyE5MhGWH \n— Feeno (@ArianFoster) March 5, 2017 i've studied the wolf. he can't read. i know his weaknesses. plus the thumb thing.\n— Feeno (@ArianFoster) March 5, 2017 if he bites me his main weapon is immobilized. then becomes vulnerable. this is why thumbs are so important.\n— Feeno (@ArianFoster) March 5, 2017 THUMB*. i still have a whole other arm (my right one cuz i use non dominant one to shield). i'm just smarter than the wolf. advg: me. https://t.co/5eqoF1uVf1 \n— Feeno (@ArianFoster) March 5, 2017 Foster’s right — his thumbs give him a clear advantage in this scenario. He can choke out or restrain the wolf, who he outweighs, while the wolf really only has one weapon, his mouth. Once he bites, as long as it’s a body part that isn’t life threatening, Foster has the upper hand.\n“The wolf will go straight for the arteries,” you say.\nNope, Foster has this thought through, too.\nbro you think a wolf knows where my artery is? all the sudden i'm fighting a wolf that knows biology? https://t.co/0rKRorDSaw \n— Feeno (@ArianFoster) March 5, 2017 He also casually owned elks. Like, damn elks, y’all gotta retire now. How the hell you gonna come back from this one?\nelks don't have websites, aggression, arms or thumbs. just a walking meal. https://t.co/6L7K0pYdBE \n— Feeno (@ArianFoster) March 5, 2017 (Was this guy an elk? Because he got owned, too.)\nalso hasn't been to 4 probowls, overcome those injuries and DOESNT HAVE THUMBS. advg: me, fucker. https://t.co/337xEc8k05 \n— Feeno (@ArianFoster) March 5, 2017 I’d bet $100 right on Foster to come out on top. I’m not saying *I* could beat a wolf, but I’ll take a recently retired NFL running back against an animal he outweighs 50 to 100 pounds any day of the week.\nWhere does Foster draw his limits, though? Well, he’s not going after tigers.\n. @ArianFoster how you think you'd fair against cuz right here? pic.twitter.com/cr295A681D \n— Duane Brown (@DuaneBrown76) March 5, 2017 that's a tiger. i have no chance. https://t.co/9zEKI3BzRu \n— Feeno (@ArianFoster) March 5, 2017 I hope you are all having as good of a Sunday afternoon as Arian Foster is.\n(h/t Deadspin) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:00:11.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
