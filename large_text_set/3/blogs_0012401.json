(Source: AP) \nAfter Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar , ace shuttler Saina Nehwal has decided to donate Rs 6 lakh to the families of 12 CRPF jawans who were martyred in the Naxal attack in Sukhma of Chhattisgarh. Stating that she is pained with deaths of the 12 Central Reserve Police Force jawans, the London Olympics bronze medalist has confirmed the donation of Rs 50,000 to each of the 12 families. \n“My heart goes out to our soldiers who put their lives at risk to keep us safe. I can’t bring those soldiers back who lost their lives in Chhattisgarh but in my small way I want to donate this six lakhs for those families,” Saina told PTI from Bangalore. \nEarlier yesterday, in another major patriotic move, Akshay Kumar has donated Rs 1.08 crore to the families of 12 martyrs. According to officials, the actor had approached the Home Ministry soon after the ambush and had sought to obtain the bank account numbers of the family members of the slain jawans. Following the requests of monetary donation, the ministry has directed the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to share the bonafide bank account number of the families of the personnel who lost lives in the March 11 attack. The B-town star has donated Rs 9 lakh to the families of each of the 12 martyrs. \nAlso Watch: \nDays back, 12 CRPF personnel were killed in a deadly ambush in Chhattisgarh’s worst Naxal-hit district of Sukma on March 11 when they were out on a patrol. The deceased CRPF personnel have been identified as Inspector Jagjit Singh, Assistant Sub-inspectors H B Bhatt and Narender Kumar Singh, head constables Jagdish Prasad Vishnoi and P R Minde and constables Mangesh Pal Pandey, Rampal Singh Yadav, Goraknath, Nand Kumar Patra, Satish Kumar Verma, K Shankar and Suresh Kumar. \nThe troops belonged to the 219th battalion of the force deployed in the state for conducting anti-Naxal operations. The ‘Khiladi’ fame actor had also recently met Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi expressing his desire to contribute to the security forces and also with a plan to develop an smartphone app (application) so that any citizen can donate money to the family of those needy jawans or officers who get killed in the line of duty. \n(With inputs from agencies)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T18:21:11.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
