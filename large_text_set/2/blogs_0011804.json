The fast casual spot is heading across the river to Allandale, taking over Republic of Sandwich’s now-empty address . Update, February 13, 2017: The second Poke Poke is now soft open with its made-to-order and speciality menus available from noon to 5 p.m. this week through Friday. Hours will expand later. The new menu will include those same build-your-own poke bowls, with signature combinations like JT's Poke Bowl and shiso salmon, plus non-fishy acai bowls. Since the space was already configured by Republic, the restaurant will take advantage of the deli case to serve poke by the pound, along with forays into different cooked poke varieties, including beef and shrimp. Unlike the South Congress location, it won’t sell beer. Co-owners Jason McVearry and Trish Fortuna are looking to open by the beginning of February. Once the second location is up and running, they’ll turn their attentions towards expanding into Houston or Dallas. Poke Poke first opened as a walk-up counter in Venice Beach, California in 2010. The Austin location, its first proper brick and mortar, took over a shuttered Amy's Ice Cream spot.
