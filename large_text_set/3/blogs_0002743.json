Langley, Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs sent out an email to students and staff Wednesday detailing the incident. \n“Intimidation of any member of our community is intimidation of all members. We stand in solidarity. If anyone sees or experiences harassment, please contact the campus police; students are encouraged to contact the Division of Student Affairs,” said Langley. \nThe posters were taken down Tuesday, but were up long enough to offend students on campus.

So it’s not like there is a swastika so you have to look at what they are saying,” UMass Boston graduate student Jenean McGee.

Many White people are tired of anti-White rhetoric, Leftist violence, Black Lives Matter, multiculturalism, etc,” said Reinhard Wolff, Director of Administration, Identity Evropa. \n“Obviously, I was very offended I don’t want that thing happening at UMass at all. I want it to be a place where everyone can come,” said Garcia. \n“We’re a public institution people should feel safe on our campus and not feel like they are getting hate speech,” said McGee. \nIdentity Evropa said they’re not concerned the posters were taken down and said they plan to put up more on campus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T15:47:19.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
