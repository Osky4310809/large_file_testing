Canadian Press January 31, 2017, 9:50 PM Canadian Press January 31, 2017, 9:50 PM \nTORONTO – Kyle Lowry scored 33 points, including a huge basket with four seconds left in overtime, to lift the Toronto Raptors over the New Orleans Pelicans 108-106 on Tuesday. \nThe victory was just the struggling Raptors’ second in eight outings. \nLowry also had 10 assists for a double-double. Jonas Valanciunas added 20 points and 12 rebounds for the Raptors (30-19), who were playing for the fourth time in five games without all-star guard DeMar DeRozan. Norman Powell added 18 points. \nJrue Holiday led New Orleans (19-30) with 30 points. \nThe Raptors have been mired in their worst slump in a couple of seasons. The culprit, according to coach Dwane Casey: their defence. The coach was livid after Sunday's 114-113 loss to Orlando, calling the team's defensive effort \"atrocious.\" \nTheir defence was horrible at points again Tuesday as they fell behind by 14 points. But they came out aggressive after halftime and a big third quarter got them back in the game. The Raptors led 77-75 with one quarter to play.
