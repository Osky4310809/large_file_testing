Why not make the most of it?\nView As: One Page Slides A phone case Amazon One of the biggest reasons people don't put an iPhone case on is because of the added weight and bulk, but with this case, that's not a problem. Heftier cases will provide more support, but if you're looking for the bare minimum to prevent scratching and some resistance if your phone falls, this is a good option.\nClear JETech iPhone Case, $6.99, available at Amazon\nA portable battery Amazon I've beaten this drum before, but for good reason. There's no reason not to have an external battery pack anymore; they're inexpensive, can fit easily in a pocket or purse, and will charge your phone in a pinch. I've used Anker batteries for years and continue to recommend them to my family and friends. They're rock solid performers.\nAnker Astro E1 5200mAh Portable Charger, $15.99, available at Amazon\nA pair of earbuds Amazon I love a good pair of headphones, but it's easier to wear a pair of earbuds if you're commuting or going on a trip. This pair from Francois et Mimi have a wooden finish, integrated mic, and are noise-isolating. I've read enough good things about them that I'm going to be giving them a try myself soon.\nFrancois et Mimi Elite Noise-Isolating Earbuds, $18.60 , available at Amazon\nA heavier duty case Amazon If you've already gone through the experience of having Apple replace your iPhone because of a drop, use this and the next pick together. Spigen's case insulates your case with a soft and hard layer, with specific fortification of the corners. It's a little bulkier and heavier than the JETech case I mentioned earlier, but will provide significantly more protection if your phone falls.\nSpigen Tough Armor Heavy Duty iPhone 6 Case, $17.47, available at Amazon\nA screen protector Amazon Nothing is worse than a scratched screen, whether from keys in your pocket or a light fall. Three times the hardness of plastic, this screen protector will do more to keep your phone safe from the power of gravity than your standard one.\nWolf Totem iP hone Screen Protector, $5.99, available at Amazon\nA better Lightning cable Amazon Our pick for the best Lightning cable , Monoprice's cable holds up where Apple's falters: the durability department. Apple cables are notorious for fraying over time, but after seven months of testing, Monoprice's held up. They're more expensive than most other brands, but still less expensive than Apple's official Lightning cable.\nMonoprice Lightning Cable (4ft), $14.48, available at Amazon\nA multi-port wall charger Amazon This is on the list to help settle disputes. If you're in a home with multiple people who need to charge their devices at the same time, this Anker wall charger will save you an outlet. It doesn't support quick charging, but neither does the iPhone, so you won't be missing out on anything. Instead you and a friend or family member can charge your devices simultaneously. Just remember to pick up an extra Monoprice cable.\nAnker 24W Dual USB Wall Charger PowerPort, $10.99, available at Amazon\nA dock Amazon An iPhone dock is something you don't realize you need until you buy one. Stick it on a desk and you'll have a place to put your phone. Every. Single. Time. Once it becomes routine, you'll dock your phone without noticing and always have a full battery. Plus, it's nice to have your phone upright on your desk if you get a notification, where you can quickly glance over and decide if it's worth your time.\nSpinido iPhone Charging Dock Station, $12.99, available at Amazon\nThis article was originally published on 7/26/2016.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
