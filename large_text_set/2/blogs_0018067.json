Each one of these pets is an individual. Each one is a valued life worth saving. That number should be zero — and it can be. There is so much you can do to help save homeless pets — like supporting spay/neuter programs, adopting your next furry family member from a shelter or rescue group, and just spreading the word about the many pets in shelters waiting for that second chance. And right now, you can help by pledging to end the killing of dogs and cats in shelters. For more than 30 years, Best Friends Animal Society has been working to save the lives of homeless pets and running the largest no-kill animal sanctuary in the country. And in that time, with crucial support from caring individuals like you, the number of animals killed each year has decreased from 17 million to around 4 million. But working together, we can bring that number to zero. Pledge to end the killing of dogs and cats in shelters. Together, we can Save Them All®.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:00:09.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
