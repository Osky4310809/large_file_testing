The three Ball brothers are dominating the basketball world. The oldest brother, Lonzo Ball, is the potential No. 1 pick in this year's NBA Draft. He is averaging 15.1 points, 5.8 rebounds and 7.8 assists at UCLA. LiAngelo Ball, a senior at Chino Hills High School (California), will be taking his talents to UCLA next season. The youngest brother, LaMelo Ball, is only a sophomore in high school, but he's no less talented than his older siblings. \nRELATED: The Homemade Training That Propelled Lonzo Ball and His Brothers to Basketball Stardom \nLaMelo's game recently blew up on social media after he called an outrageous half-court shot in the middle of a game. He pointed to the spot where he was going to shoot and then made the incredible shot. But if you thought it would be impossible to do anything more spectacular, you'd be wrong. This dude LaMelo Ball pointed at the half court line and then casually pulled from there he's our new god now pic.twitter.com/nKGarnc2bi \n— Zach Harper (@talkhoops) December 27, 2016 \nDuring Chino Hills' game on Tuesday, LaMelo scored 92 points. Yes, you read that correctly–92 points! During his team's 146-123 victory over Los Osos High School, the sophomore shot 30-of-39 from 2-point range and 7-of-22 from downtown. He was also 11-of-14 from the free-throw line and had seven assists and five rebounds. Since his older brother LiAngelo was not playing due to injury, LaMelo had the ultimate green light. LaMelo Ball dropped 92 points (!!) last night. \n— go90Sports (@go90Sports) February 8, 2017 \nLaMelo scored 63 of his points in the second half and 41 in the fourth quarter alone. And remember, high school basketball quarters are only eight minutes long. LaMelo is already committed to UCLA like his older brothers. According to MaxPreps , in the Class of 2019, LaMelo is ranked No.1 in the nation and No.1 in the State of California.
