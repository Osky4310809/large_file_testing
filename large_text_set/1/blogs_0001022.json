Customer Reviews by Matt Storms So, here you are debating wether or not to buy this audiobook. You've heard this Ramsey guy knows his stuff, but the reviewers complain that he's preaching Jeebus at you. What do you make of it? Let me tell you. My wife used to drag me, kicking and screaming, to the kitchen table so we could discuss the dreaded F-word... Finances. She couldn't get me to open up and I refused to talk about money. One day she showed me a documentary called Maxed Out that opened my eyes. I realized I was spiralling out of control and was headed to the poor house. There it was. I had fought half the battle and realized I needed to change. But what do I do? Where do I start? I have bad credit. I was young and dumb and had wound up in $20,000 in debt.That's where Dave Ramsey comes in. Maxed Out had featured Dave for a few minutes and he left an impression on me. He had a plan. It was simple. It made sense. It was easy enough for me to understand, and it was good enough to get me to change my ways. My wife and I had a long, but productive talk about how to get ourselves financially fit and change our family tree.We bought the Total Money Makeover, and we used the baby steps and the smart money principles that Ramsey teaches and today, we're out of credit card debt, we're about to pay off my car, and we are making smart decisions that will allow us to be prosperous and wealthy.And as a bonus, we never fight at the kitchen table anymore. The Bottom Line:Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover is financial freedom and security in a simple, and easy to understand format. Great financial advice by quintash To those who are \"offended\" that Dave Ramsey talks about God and (gasp) Jesus in his book; you should know that as a Christian he Can Not deny that the information he gives it totally biblical-and Christian based. And to reject his book and ideas for only this reason is simply foolish. Our society says \"Be tolerant of everything...\" and yet by saying that and NOT being tolerant of Christanity is total hypocrosy. Dave Ramsey's total money make over it great financial advice for the Christian Believer or non...just remember to be tolerant...always. Ignore the religion, you're in trouble, this will help by Grand Funkin' Railroad For those offended by religion, Can't you just get by it? Its what makes Dave what he is. It gives him strength and inspiration. And it doesn't hurt you a bit. The following quote can apply to a lot of beliefs, spiritual or secular. \"Stand for something or fall for anything.\" I think Dave takes his faith and it gives him strength, purpose and resolve. We can all use that wherever we find it. Now for the advice, if you follow it, you will start to see improvements anywhere from immediately to a few short months. It works. And most importantly, it gives you a plan that is proven to work. And that is half the battle, knowing you will succeed if you try this. I wish I could find a diet with the same results as Dave's advice. I'd listen to Buddha if that would work :)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:15:51.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
