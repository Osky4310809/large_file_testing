Disillusioned with BJP, hence on twitter for REVENGE Feb 25 Brainwashed by Modi, Manak Gupta insults daughter of a Martyr Manak Gupta (@manakgupta, Anchor / TV Journalist with News 24 channel) today asked a Martyr’s daughter If his father was wrong in dying for his motherland (India)? See his tweet above, now deleted. Why? Because she opposed ABVP (which is RSS’s Political Wing BJP’s Student Wing). And then Mr Gupta did several tweets and retweets explaining how she is a brainwashed kid and how he is with her and against ABVP Goons. My simple question is this: Did Manak Gupta do so many tweets on BJP leaders caught spying for ISI? Answer is No. You can check his TL. Why? Because Mr Gupta is brainwashed by Modi. Modi who, you ask? Yes, the same “Donkey Inspired” PM of India who went to Pakistan uninvited to celebrate Pakistan’s PM Nawaz Sharif’s Birth Day. The Fakeer who wears 10 lakh suite (never repeats a dress, I’ve heard). The accountable Pradhan Sevak who doesn’t give answers of ANY QUESTION. Yes, I say Manak Gupta is brainwashed by Modi. And this is the best way to put it. Otherwise, we’ll have to accept that Manak Gupta is Paid Journo of ISI’s Spy BJP. Let’s not go there. Let’s settle with Brainwashed. If Manak Gupta can claim that a Martyr’s daughter is brainwashed, I can certainly say Manak Gupta is Brainwashed. If Manak Gupta can say Journos have been brainwashing Martyr’s Kid, I sure can say Manak Gupta has been brainwashing his audience. Manak Gupta’s problem with Martyr’s daughter was that she opposed ABVP goons (see above image), but she did not oppose those who were shouting Anti-India slogans. Now this is interesting. I ask did PM Modi oppose those who were shouting Anti-India slogans? Who is running India? Martyr’s daughter or PM Modi? It’s OK if PM doesn’t oppose Anti-India slogans, but Martyr’s daughter must oppose Anti-India slogans? Why Martyr’s daughter is questionable but PM Modi is not? I tell you why. Manak Gupta is Brainwashed by Modi. But let’s examine this “Why did you not oppose Anti-India slogans” question. PM Modi’s friend Pakistan has been slaughtering Indian Soldiers regularly at borders. Manak Gupta doesn’t oppose that, but expects others to oppose Anti-India slogans. So what should an ordinary Indian do? Ignore slaughter of our soldiers and oppose slogans? That’s what Manak Gupta does. I don’t see 126 crore Indians opposing Anti-India slogans, but they sure sympathize with families of soldiers slaughtered by Manak Gupta’s PM Modi’s friend Pakistan. So 126 crore Indians are wrong, and Manak Gupta is right? By the way, What is an Anti-India slogan? And why should people leave everything they’re doing to oppose Anti-India slogans? Is our PM so useless that People will have to raise their voice? What the hack did we elect PM for? Someone shouts Anti-India slogans and Manak Gupta insults Martyr’s daughter. Pakistan slaughters India’s soldiers and Manak gupta remains MUTE. Either Manak Gupta really wants to shift attention from real issues like Slaughter of our Soldiers & ABVP’s Goondagardi or He’s brainwashed by Modi. Let’s go with Brainwashed. But Manak Gupta says he opposes ABVP’s goondagardi too, although you’ll find no tweets on his TL opposing ABVP’s goondagardi before he tweeted an Insult to Martyr’s Daughter. He certainly tweeted opposing ABVP afterwards, to save face, but not before. Manak Gupta thinks Indians are Fool. Indians certainly are fool if they believe Manak Gupta even after reading his TL. His TL is proof that Manak Gupta is either BJP’s stooge or Brainwashed by Modi. I’ll go with Brainwashed again. Interestingly, Manak Gupta thinks opposing Anti-India slogans and ignoring slaughter of our soldiers is Nationalism. Questioning martyr’s daughter but burying BJP’s links with ISI is nationalism. Forget Manak Gupta, how many channels remembered that in 2009 RSS leader Dayanand Pandey confessed in front of Police that RSS was allegedly funded by ISI ? This is BJP Supporter’s favorite Zee News’s report. Yes, 100 Cr extortion fame Sudhir Chaudhary works there. Even he didn’t remember own channel’s news on RSS’s ISI links. Sure all RSS leaders may not be ISI stooges. 1% may still be loyal to India, but can I trust RSS? Can you? Manak Gupta can’t question RSS-BJP’s ISI links. He’s not asking how can a person from an ISI funded organization remain PM of India. His question is, why didn’t Martyr’s daughter oppose Anti-India slogans? Of course I’m with Manak Gupta in opposing Anti-India slogans, like Manak Gupta is with Martyr’s daughter in opposing ABVP Goons. And I’m also saying Manak Gupta has been brainwashed by Modi, like he says Martyr’s daughter is brainwashed by some journos. To tell you the truth, I think BJP is 100% ISI’s stooge. Pakistan can not defeat Indian Army so what did they do? They gave RSS supari to destroy India-so to speak. Pakistan knew that RSS was the same force which opposed India’s freedom fighters fighting against the British. RSS leaders have been alleged for spying on Indian freedom fighters for the British in past, and BJP leaders have been caught spying India for Pakistan’s ISI. It’s in their DNA. I think Modi-Nawaz made a deal. Demonetization in exchange of Surgical Strike. Pakistan lost a few militants and Modi destroyed India’s economy. But of course, Manak Gupta doesn’t think so. He’ll say someone has brainwashed me and I’ll say Modi has brainwashed him. No matter who is brainwashed, today an Indian Martyr’s daughter’s patriotism was questioned by Manak Gupta, knowing full well that she is kid. And that’s how we reward children of those who sacrifice their own life for India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T15:48:45.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
