The Playboy model has six million followers on Instagram (Photo: Getty Images) \nMuch to his surprise and probably anyone who followed him, the Playboy beauty agreed. \nThe pressure is now on as his poor performances at the last five tournaments have basically put him in an all or nothing position. \nMurray needs to win the Houston Open at the end of March to land a spot at Augusta but he has now got all the motivation he needs to qualify and few could blame him. Murray could not believe his luck when Pelas agreed to his request (Photo: Getty Images) \nPelas, who has six million Instagram followers, is regarded as one of the sexiest social media stars and a number of sporting stars have tried and failed in their attempts to meet up with the model. \nCricket legend Shane Warne offered his support in the form of social media likes while Calum Best, son of football legend George, has also been in a relationship with the 25-year-old. Instagram Murray has to win the Houston Open to stand any chance of Pelas appearing alongside him (Photo: Getty Images) \nAll eyes are now on Murray to see if he can qualify for the Masters and have a Playboy model to accompany him around the course. \nThe golfing fans will certainly hope that can be the case! poll loading Who will win The Masters' green jacket this year? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:54:07.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
