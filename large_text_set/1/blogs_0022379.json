In 2010, he embarked on his first walk across the country, writing on his website about the animals that followed him, the people who fed him and the travails of like-minded adventurers he met along the way, like the two bikers trying to get to Miami from Los Angeles for cancer research but who were halted in their tracks when a truck hit one of them.

They told him, he said, “We’ve met some of the worst people ever on this trip , but the landscapes are beautiful.” On the 100th day, Mr. Baumer walked from Defuniak Springs to Mossy Head. He took a photograph of himself standing with his toes near the spray-painted word “killed” on the road, with an arrow pointing ahead. The image captured a gas line connection on a grassy lawn, and it was the last one on his blog. He sat on a bench in the rain and spoke to his father.

Eddie W. Elmore of the Florida Highway Patrol said that Mr. Baumer’s death was still under investigation.
