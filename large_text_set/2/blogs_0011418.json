By Tim Parker | Updated February 15, 2017 — 6:00 AM EST Loading the player... \nEverybody has an opinion on how much money you should tuck away in your bank account. The truth is, it depends on your financial situation. \nWhat you need to keep in the bank is the money for your regular bills, your discretionary spending and the portion of your savings that constitutes your emergency fund. \nEverything starts with your budget. If you don’t budget correctly, you may not have anything to keep in your bank account. \nDon't have a budget? Now's the time to build one. Some thoughts on how: The 50/30/20 Rule \nFirst let’s look at the ever-popular 50/30/20 rule. Instead of trying to follow a complicated, crazy-number-of-lines budget, you can think of your money as sitting in three buckets. \nCosts that Don’t Change (Fixed): 50% \nIt would be nice if you didn’t have monthly bills but the electricity bill cometh, just like the water, Internet, car, and mortgage or rent bills. Assuming you’ve evaluated how these costs fit into your budget and decided they are musts, there’s not much you can do other than pay them. \nFixed costs should eat up around 50% of your monthly budget. \nDiscretionary Money: 30% \nThis is the bucket where anything (within reason) goes. It’s your money to use on wants, instead of needs. \nInterestingly, most planners include food in this bucket because there's so much choice in how you handle this expense: You could eat at a restaurant or eat at home; you could buy generic or name brand, or you could purchase a cheap can of soup or a bunch of organic ingredients and make your own. \nThis bucket also includes a movie, buying a new tablet or contributing to charity. You decide. \nThe general rule is 30% of your income, but many financial gurus will argue that 30% is much too high. \nFinancial Goals: 20% \nIf you’re not aggressively saving for the future – maybe funding an IRA, a 529 plan if you have kids, and, of course, contributing to a 401(k) or other retirement plan, if possible – you’re setting yourself up for hard times ahead. This is where the final 20% of your monthly income should go. \nIf you don't have an emergency fund (see below), most of this 20% should go first to create one. Another Budget Strategy \nFinancial guru Dave Ramsey has a different take on how you should carve up your cash. His recommended allocations look something like this (expressed as a percentage of your take-home pay): \nCharitable Giving: 10-15%", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:19:35.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
