Andrew M. Cuomo , who framed the plan as a kind of reprise of the famed “Ford to City: Drop Dead” moment from the 1970s, calling it “a targeted war” on his state.

He accused Mr. Collins and his Republican colleague Representative John Faso of practicing “cheap politics” in supporting the amendment. “There is no fairy that is going to float down and hand over $2.3 billion,” he said. Mr. Collins sharply defended the plan, accusing Mr. Cuomo of exaggerating its impact. “He is Chicken Little: The sky is falling,” said Mr. Collins, who represents a Buffalo area district, adding that the governor was “in a panic” because it would force him to spend discretionary state money. He also noted that the change wouldn’t take effect until 2020. \n  “The best news is that he’s not going to get re-elected next year,” Mr. Collins said. “I’m sure a new governor is going to have no problem with this.” The amendment was cheered in some economically beleaguered quarters of upstate New York where leaders have long groused about the Medicaid payments’ impact on their budgets. But in a sign of the complexity and confusion surrounding the issue, neither the criticism nor the praise was perfectly partisan on Tuesday: Some Democrats hailed the idea as a needed dose of local mandate relief while some state Republicans reacted with deep skepticism about the plan’s financial impact. \n  Some Democrats, including Brian Higgins, another Buffalo area congressman, have spoken in favor of such mandate relief, while still opposing the broader Republican overhaul, which he said could “have a boomerang effect that will cost New Yorkers and local residents more in the end.” Such political dissonance was common as word of the possible inclusion of the amendment spread. Bill Samuels, a well-known New York progressive, called the Republican health care bill “otherwise calamitous,” but nonetheless supported the idea of the state’s picking up billions in costs. “Cuomo and the Albany leaders have created their own problem by abdicating their responsibility,” he said, adding that property taxes had driven away residents and businesses. “No other state burdens its counties the way New York State does.” \nAdvertisement But Representative Louise Slaughter, an upstate Democrat, said Republicans were trying “steal billions from New York to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy,” calling the shift “a political sleight of hand.” Photo Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo assailed Mr. Collins’s proposal. “New York is the only state in the nation affected by this amendment,” he said. Credit Kathy Willens/Associated Press And Representative Dan Donovan, the lone Republican in New York City’s congressional delegation, expressed concern that the provision — which excludes New York City — could actually harm his constituents. \n  “If the counties aren’t going to have to pay $2.3 billion any longer, that’s got to either be made up somewhere else, and if it’s made up by increasing taxes of all New Yorkers, it’s going to affect my people in a negative way,” he said. “Or it’s going to result in a cut in services.” Mr. Cuomo, seemingly appalled by the Collins plan, said it could decimate the state’s health care industry, because the sudden $2.3 billion gap was likely to mean less Medicaid spending in the long term. He accused the upstate Republicans of “zealotry” and bowing to the “Ryan radical right,” a reference to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who backs the bill.
