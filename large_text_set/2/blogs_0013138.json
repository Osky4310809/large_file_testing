Nine years later they filmed a sex scene together for The Squid and the Whale .\nID: 10539636 20. 127 Hours View this image ›\nFox Searchlight Pictures It’s easy to forget that this is a true story, because the thought of hacking off your own arm is a pretty disgusting one. The film is based on Aron Ralston’s memoir, Between a Rock and a Hard Place .\nFun fact: The video camera that James Franco uses in the film is the same one that Ralston used while trapped.\nID: 10539637 21. 50/50 View this image ›\nSummit Entertainment 50/50 was written by Will Reiser, who based it on his own experiences after being diagnosed with cancer.\nFun fact: Reiser worked on Da Ali G Show with Seth Rogen, who encouraged him to write the screenplay for this movie.\nID: 10539641 22.
