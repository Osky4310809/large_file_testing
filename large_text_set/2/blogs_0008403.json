I wasn't too happy with that. West Brom 1-0 Stoke \n\"Any number of things surrounding the game were, in our view, unnecessary. There was a voicemail left, and I haven't heard it. But Ryan wasn't too pleased. He tried to ring back and didn't get any answer.\" \nShawcross has accused Albion of leaking details of Berahino's ban and Pulis, speaking on Friday, said: \"Ryan has tried to ring me since that [the quotes on Berahino] and I will get back to him.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:41:53.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
