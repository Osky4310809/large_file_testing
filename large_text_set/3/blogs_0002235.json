I've never cared for the Stones. They never had anything to offer me musically, especially in the drumming department. \n\"The Stones is not the original band and I do not care for them. I think if you came to see an Aerosmith concert, people would realize that we play so much better than them that it's silly because they're not so good live. Yeah, they are what they are and all of that, but I don't think there's a band out there today that does what we do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T13:13:01.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
