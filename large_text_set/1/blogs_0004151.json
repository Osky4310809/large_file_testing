January 3, 2017 11:22 PM By Nicole Brewer \nPHILADELPHIA (CBS) — After scrapping plans for a new plant in Mexico, Ford announced it would instead invest $700 million into a facility in Flat Rock, Michigan, creating 700 new jobs. \n“I think it’s a good move,” said James Farley of Atlantic City, New Jersey. \nSean McCabe of Cedar Grove, New Jersey added, “Jobs should stay here.” \nFord says it made the decision, in part because of the pro-growth policies outlined by President Elect Donald Trump, who has publicly shamed the company for shipping jobs overseas. \nAnd just today, Trump tweeted General Motors, threatening tariffs if they don’t manufacture in the US. \n“Trump is brash, but he’s also a sharp and shrewd businessman,” said McCabe. \nVignette Williams of Philadelphia added, “Regardless of who’s investigating the change, it’s a good thing.” \n“It certainly is a great PR message,” said Dr. Bill Rosenberg, a Political Science professor at Drexel University, “but in terms of actual growth of the economy, its not so clear.” \nRosenberg went on to say that what appears in the beginning is not necessarily what happens in the end. \nRosenberg says Trump’s deal with Carrier, an air conditioner and furnace manufacturer, produced only half the jobs promised and was largely subsidized by his Vice President’s home state of Indiana. \nRosenberg said, “What happens a year from now? Is the state of Indiana still subsidized or not? We have to look at long term growth, not just the headline, “these jobs are going to be in the US.” \nJames Farley summed it up by saying, “Just have to prepare for worst, hope for the best.” Nicole Brewer facebook Follow Philadelphia’s own Nicole Brewer answers your Good Question every night at 11p.m. on Eyewitness News.
