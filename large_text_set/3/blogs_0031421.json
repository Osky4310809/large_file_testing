In addition to Kislyak, the Times reported that Kushner also met with Sergey N. Gorkov, an oligarch who leads a Russian bank currently under U.S. sanctions. \nWithin minutes of the story’s publication, co-author Maggie Haberman called into New Day from an Acela Train. \n“This is the highest person to be touched by this investigation so far,” she told co-hosts Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota .”Also the only person so far still serving in the administration.” Haberman noted Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recusal from any investigation. \nHaberman was careful to stress that the meetings alone did not suggest any wrongdoing, but that it was “yet another in a series of drip drip” revelations emerging from the White House. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:16:44.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
