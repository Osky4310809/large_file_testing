If like myself, you’re in dire need of some motivation right now then this video is just what the doctor ordered.\nDwayne ‘ The Rock ‘ Johnson just released this supercut on his YouTube channel and it shows a sped up version of what his daily gym routine is. This is the very definition of #GymGoals. Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson has managed to keep his body in immaculate shape for decades. Sure, he’s been gifted with Herculean genetics which allows him to see gains light years faster than the average human being. But , The Rock truly puts in the work.\nHere I am, watching this video, and thinking about how I felt like I’d really gotten a pump going after spending 40 minutes at the gym last night. The Rock spends 40 minutes of every waking hour at the gym.\nWhat’s astonishing is how he has remained so focused over the years. My biggest issue with a lifting routine is the monotony. The best workouts I have are outdoors, and they’re activities like mountain biking or rock climbing. I’m most impressed that after all these years Dwayne Johnson is still able to get amped up to hit the gym every single day without losing interest.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:29:34.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
