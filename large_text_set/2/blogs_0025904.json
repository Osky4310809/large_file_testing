And Steinfeld’s 2017 Academy Award dress has 100% done it again. She wore a floral Ralph & Russo Couture gown with a halter neck and ruffled back in a light lavender. It’s essentially Spring-incarnate.\nShe chatted with PEOPLE about the gown, which was apparently the only one she even tried on for the event. “There wasn’t much deciding. It was kind of just, it was the one from the very start,” she told PEOPLE in an interview . It’s her favorite dress of the season, obv, and we totally get why. It almost looks as if the dress is pulsing with life.\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images Hailee is known for her fairy-tale looks on the red carpet, and there’s something about this dreamy, floral number that feels like a perfect mixture of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez. The high neck line suits Hailee perfectly, and the ruffles are feminine but not over the top. Absolutely swoon-worthy.\nHere’s the view from the back. Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic Sexy and mysterious, all at once. And let’s get a close up. Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic She has her hair swept back to make room for the ruffles, and she’s rocking a smoky eye and light pink lips. All it takes is a couple of diamond studs in her ears, and her look is perfect and complete.\nThe Academy Awards aren’t completely new to Hailee. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in True Grit in 2011. She was only 14 at the time. This was her second time going to the Oscars, and she told PEOPLE she’s just as excited about being there as she was her first time.\nWe think this might be one of the best looks of the night, and certainly one of the most memorable dresses of all time. Come on, she’s an elegant walking garden, for goodness sake.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:37:15.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
