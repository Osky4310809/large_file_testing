While leaks about upcoming Nokia devices have been plentiful, the brand has decided to give them rest by lifting the curtains off the Nokia 6 Android smartphone . Since the device kickstarts Nokia’s comeback portfolio and might even indicate the philosophy its upcoming phones will follow, it’s important to take an analytical look at the Nokia 6. That’s why we are bringing you a list of six things you need to know about the first official Android smartphone from Nokia’s stable. Looks stunning from all angles \nThe Nokia 6 features a unibody construction with use of the 6000 series aluminium. The handset sports an impressive design language with its 2.5D display curving towards the edges, lending it a bezel-less look. The fascia is minimalistic otherwise, and the home button at the bottom doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. You might feel nostalgic when you turn the phone around, as the camera module of the Nokia 6 – consisting of the sensor and the LED flash – is placed on a vertical strip, similar to Nokia’s Asha series. The handset is quite slim at 7.85mm, though if you include the camera protrusion, then the thickness goes up to 8.4mm. \nAlong with the gorgeous design, the company is also highlighting the durability aspect of the smartphone. As per the brand, “i t takes 55 minutes to machine a single Nokia 6 from a solid block of 6000 series aluminium. It then receives two separate anodising processes, taking over ten hours to complete, with each phone being polished no less than five times. The end result is an aluminium unibody with the highest level of visual and structural quality. ” A large 5.5-inch canvas \nThe Nokia 6 falls in the phablet category with its 5.5-inch display. The hybrid in-cell IPS screen bears a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, ensuring sharp text and crisp images thanks to its pixel density of 403ppi. To offer better sunlight legibility, the brand has employed a polarising layer. A layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 offers protection against scratches and minor knocks. \nFor multimedia fanatics, the device rocks dual amplifiers, which can deliver 6dB louder sound output than a standard amplifier. The audio experience is further amplified with Dolby Atmos support that promises surround sound. Packs in a mediocre processor, but promises swift multitasking \nUnder the hood, the Nokia 6 draws power from a Snapdragon 430 SoC, which has eight cores tuned at 1.4GHz. The 64-bit processor is quite popular in the sub-Rs 10,000 segment and should be able to offer smooth performance. However, its Adreno 505 GPU isn’t meant for heavy gaming – and that’s a big bummer. We’d have loved to see a Snapdragon 650 / 652 chip or the power-efficient Snapdragon 625 in the Nokia 6. Multitasking should be flawless though, as the phone features beefy a 4 gigs of RAM. Its 64GB in-built storage should also be sufficient for most users, though it does offer an option to expand it further with the use of a microSD card of up to 128GB. \nThe Nokia 6 ships with the latest version of Android, i.e. 7.0 Nougat, and the company hasn’t crammed it with bloatware. The company is also promising timely software updates to latest builds of Google’s OS. 16-megapixel goodness \nNokia has always been known for its imaging prowess, and we certainly hope that the new smartphones from the brand would continue the same legacy. The camera hardware on the Nokia 6 is quite potent. At the back, it sports a 16-megapixel sensor measuring 1µm with an aperture of f/2.0. It boasts fast autofocussing capabilities with PDAF technology, and is accompanied by a dual-tone LED flash to shoot in dim environments. The camera UI on the handset detects scenes intelligently to select the apt shooting mode. \nFor selfie enthusiasts, the Nokia 6 has an 8-meg snapper at the front with an aperture of f/2.0. To ensure a wide frame in selfies, it has a wide angle of 84-degrees. A 3,000mAh battery to keep it running \nRunning the show on the Nokia 6 is a 3,000mAh battery, which the brand claims would offer a standby time of up to 32 days. It should easily last a day considering the company is promising a 3G talk time of 18 hours. \nThe mobile has all the connectivity options, including 4G (both TDD and FDD bands), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS. China exclusive, as of now \nWhile everything is impressive about the Nokia 6, you can’t get it even if you want to. The company will be launching the phone only in China in partnership with online retailer JD.com. It has made this strategic decision considering China is among the top smartphone markets, as it has stated “ With over 552 million smartphone users in China in 2016, a figure that is predicted to grow to more than 593 million users by 2017, it is a strategically important market where premium design and quality is highly valued by consumers. ” \nNokia is playing to its strengths as the phablet is priced in the mid-range – 1,699 RMB (roughly Rs 17,000). Although, if you ask us, it seems to be priced slightly higher. \n( Related read: Leaked presentation slide reveals HMD Global will launch up to 7 Nokia Android phones this year ) \nHaving said that, Nokia has certainly managed to hit a six (quite literally) with its first offering. The new phone seems like a perfect blend of everything the company is known for, and offers decent specs ample for a modern smartphone. The news has surely made us excited about what Nokia has on cards for us in the coming months. What about you? Would you like to get your hands on Nokia’s first proper Android phone?
