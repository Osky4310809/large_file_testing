The American government does exactly the opposite, which is why we have a lot of twisted political speech and a lot of bad deals. Mr. Putin does the exact same thing and does it brilliantly and successfully. Mr. Trump is going to do the same sorts of things.\" \nTrump's business background has given him skills valuable to government, such as negotiation. A novice but talented politician, Tuesday's speech represented a step forward in his political development, Flanagan said, adding that Trump was starting to sound like a traditional US president. \n\"This speech was the next step along the discussion on many important issues, and I think what separates this speech from much of that was the fact that this was the first time he sounded like a traditional president, who has been steeped in a long political process, rather than sounding like a good guy who's come in from the private sector and people find relief, pleasantness in this and that's a good thing.\" \nHave you heard the news?
