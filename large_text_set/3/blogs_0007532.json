Please oh God in heaven keep this family in your prayers. Never heard anything like it. \n\"Can't imagine how they feel.\" \nAnother added: \"Never heard worse. Everyone pray for their families at this very sad time\", while another said: \"RIP to the three who lost their lives and praying the other two get better. Heartbreaking.\". \nA spokesman for Dublin Fire Brigade said a number of 999 calls were made about the blaze, with the first alert coming in at 2.33am.

Gardai appealed for witnesses to come forward following the fire (Photo: PA) \nChildren's Minister Katherine Zappone said her thoughts and prayers were with all those affected by the Clondalkin fire. \nGardai, meanwhile, appealed for witnesses to come forward. \nThe apartment complex - used by Sonas to house women and kids who have sought refuge from domestic violence - has been sealed off. \nA technical examination to try to determine the cause of the devastating fire is expected to take place later today. \nIn a separate incident, a number of people were injured after a blaze broke out in an apartment complex in Dominick Street in Dublin's north inner city. \nTwenty people were either rescued or managed to flee the building and some of those who escaped the fire were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation. \nEoin O Broin, Sinn Fein TD in Dublin Mid-West and an elected representative in the Clondalkin area for many years, said locals were numb with shock. Tributes left at the scene of the tragedy, which has left residents shocked (Photo: PA) \nHe described the Clondalkin fire as \"numbingly heartbreaking\". \nHe told Dublin Live: “While any loss of life is always incredibly sad, to hear of the death of two young children and a third critically ill in hospital is really just numbingly heartbreaking. \n“We know the building is a step-down facility that provides a six-month accommodation while women and children are being housed permanently. \n“A lot of the women would be local women who would be well-known in the community, and even those that would be here for short periods would be well integrated into the community; their children would be in local schools. \n“It’s a very well-run facility and a really important facility in Clondalkin, but in some sense the nature of the accommodation makes no difference. \n“There are families who have lost loved ones today, and both of those families and the wider community are grieving for them. A technical examination to try to determine the cause of the blaze is expected to take place later today (Photo: PA) \n“I’ve spoken to a number of residents here this morning, and they’re absolutely shocked and numb with the news that they’re hearing.\" \nTwo women who live in the area described the incident as \"absolutely shocking\". \n“The women in there are already going through enough as it is and then to have that and then the other people to witness it as well,\" they said. \n“You’d wonder how things like this could happen in this day and age, babies, it’s shocking, just horrific. \n\"Our prayers are with the other woman and child now, they’re still in hospital. \n“All you can do now is pray for them.” \nThe woman and four-year-old boy who remain in hospital were said to have suffered the effects of smoke inhalation. \nInspector Ken McLaughlin, based at Clondalkin Garda station, said examinations were continuing to establish the cause of the fire. \n\"I'd like to express our sincere sympathies for the families of those that are involved in this incident. It's a terrible tragedy,\" he said. Eoin O Broin, Sinn Fein TD in Dublin Mid-West, said: \"It is terrible, heartbreaking news\" (Photo: PA) \nFiona Ryan, CEO of Sonas, paid tribute to the victims of the fire. \n\"We are absolutely devastated,\" she said. \n\"Our sympathies and condolences are with the relatives and friends of the deceased and all those impacted by this awful tragedy.\" \nMs Ryan added that the charity was liaising with gardai and fire chiefs investigating the circumstances of the fire. \n\"We are currently supporting other families in the apartment complex including those unable to return to their homes because of fire damage, for whom we are sourcing alternative accommodation,\" she said. \nShe continued: \"We would ask that the privacy of all families residing in this complex be respected at this time of loss.\" \nToday, March 8, is International Women's Day. The day marks the appreciation and achievement of women across the world. \nIt also commemorates the struggle for women's rights.
