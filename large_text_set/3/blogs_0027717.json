He used a combination of his speed in transition and deftness on screens to obliterate Cleveland’s second line of defense in the paint.\nHe was even hitting his shots beyond the arc, shooting a perfect two-of-two on threes. The Wizards’ guard orchestrated his team’s 71-point first half like he has done much of the season. He made each of his first eight shots.\n37 PTS, 11 ASTS.\n\nJohn Wall handled his business tonight. pic.twitter.com/e7kxP0YURb \n— NBA (@NBA) March 26, 2017 Wall is averaging career-highs across the board. His 22.9 points per game at a 44.5 percent clip is the best in his seven-year tenure, as are his 10.8 assists and two steals per game. The league has witnessed the maturation of a Wizards point guard, whose game has slowed down even though he has not.\nNo one knows what the playoffs hold in store for Washington. If the postseason started today, the Wizards would have a tough first-round matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks . And if they made it out of that series, Washington would have a rivalry showdown against the Boston Celtics .\nBut what we do know is that John Wall is playing career basketball right now, and his play has lifted the Wizards to new heights. They took down the defending champs at 100 percent power, and Washington’s floor general got everyone involved with seven players scoring in double digits.\nIf Wall keeps playing at this level, it won’t be Milwaukee or Boston he’s worried about. It’ll be an Eastern Conference finals showdown against Cleveland. \nAnd if Saturday night was indicative of what that potential playoff series could look like come May, the Cavaliers will need to shore up their interior defense for the dynamic Wizards’ guard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T06:14:10.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
