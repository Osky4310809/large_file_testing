Senior officials in both the PMO and the office of Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett did not respond to the Post’s requests Monday for information.\nBut the Post has spoken to Liberal political staffers from different departments over the past several weeks about the challenge of meeting the government’s commitments on the indigenous and northern affairs file.\nRelated Fewer First Nations disclosed financial data after PM suspended key accountability measure Unheralded committee seeks ‘monumental change’ to the way First Nations get billions in federal funds The long wait for change in Attawapiskat: Still no youth centre, permanent mental-health workers The common theme in those discussions — which occurred on a not-for-attribution background basis — was that one of the biggest challenges is changing the culture at what is widely seen as one of the most sclerotic bureaucracies in the federal government: the department of indigenous and northern affairs.\nThat the 4,500 bureaucrats at the department have difficulty responding to change and insist on sticking to set ways is not a new revelation. Many Conservative political staffers who had to work with that department over the past decade have often said the same thing.\nIndigenous leaders have made similar complaints year in, year out for decades. Most recently, when Trudeau and Bennett attended a session in December at a special meeting of the Assembly of First Nations, several chiefs took to the microphone to praise the new attitude from the Liberal government while condemning the attitude of the non-partisan bureaucrats they deal with.\nEven the auditor general, Michael Ferguson, in his most recent report to Parliament, complained specifically about a long history of inaction and indifference at the department of indigenous and northern affairs.\n“This is now more than a decade’s worth of audits showing that programs have failed to effectively serve Canada’s indigenous peoples,” Ferguson wrote in November. “Until a problem-solving mindset is brought to these issues to develop solutions built around people instead of defaulting to litigation, arguments about money, and process roadblocks, this country will continue to squander the potential and lives of much of its indigenous population.”\nThis is now more than a decade’s worth of audits showing that programs have failed to effectively serve Canada’s indigenous peoples.\nThat said, the National Post has been told by Liberal aides working to reverse that trend that the coming year or two could bear fruit precisely because of work done in the past year to remove or overcome those “process roadblocks.”\nAs a result, the Liberals are counting on quantifiable improvements in the year ahead on everything from the number of land claims processed to the number of First Nations reserves with new drinking water systems.\nThe term “deliverology” originates with Michael Barber, a former top aide to former British prime minister Tony Blair. Barber’s firm, Sir Michael’s Delivery Associated Ltd. of London, U.K., was given a two-year, $200,000 contract by Trudeau’s government to show it how it could adapt the public sector management system used by the Blair government to the Trudeau government.\nThat contract expires at the end of the current federal fiscal year on March 31.\nBarber attended the past three cabinet retreats but he is not in Calgary this week, a spokesperson for Trudeau said.\nThat said, Matthew Mendelsohn, who was hired by Trudeau to head up a special “agenda and results” unit inside the PMO, is in Calgary this week. It has been Mendelsohn’s job to take Barber’s ideas and implement them across federal ministries.\nAttempts to reach Mendelsohn Monday were also unsuccessful.\n• Email: dakin@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidakin \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:19:14.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
