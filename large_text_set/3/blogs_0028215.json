However, some longer, narrower ‘seif’ dunes can also be seen. ‘Seif’ comes from the Arabic word for ‘sword.’ \nThe worm-like shape of the sandy formations is partly due to the direction of the sun when the photo was taken. “Here, the steep, sunlit side of the dune, called a slip face, indicates the down-wind side of the dune and direction of its migration,” NASA explained. \nThe images were captured using the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. \nThe craft has been orbiting the red planet since 2006, and has beamed back striking photos of Mars every month. \nFilmmaker Jan Fröjdman has created a breathtaking video using NASA images from the orbiter. The film opens with a nearby approach of Mars’ moon Phobos and goes on to show numerous other interesting topographical features. “There is a feeling that you are flying above Mars looking down watching interesting locations on the planet,” Fröjdman said .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:01:59.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
