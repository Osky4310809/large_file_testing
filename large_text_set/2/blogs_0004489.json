Buhari who had travelled to London on a 10-day vacation is expected back in the country next week. However, Obasanjo said instead of embarking on such negative and worrisome mission of wishing Buhari dead, the Nigerians behind the despicable acts ought to be praying for his quick recovery and return to Nigeria. The ex-President who recalled that he too was a victim of such rumoured death, made this known in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, through his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi yesterday. He cautioned the purveyors and instigators of rumoured death of their fellow human beings to desist from the shameful and wicked inclinations. According to him, those behind the death wish on President Buhari, an elderly man, are not “normal people.” “Instead of embarking on such worrisome declaration, all that the President needed “are our prayers and best wishes, which will ginger his morale to come back more stronger and better. “No normal human being will wish an elderly person dead irrespective of their differences. “If you don’t like him, wait for another election, not going about to say he is dead. “No matter his health situation, we should pray for him to recover quick and come back more stronger and better. For anyone wishing him dead, such person or group of persons are callous, wicked and treacherous. “I was also rumoured to have died almost 12 times. I don’t know what they derive from doing so, but they should seek for forgiveness. “Even if we know that the President is sick, he is in a better position to know what to say or what to do and not wishing him dead. We should just stop politicizing everything, especially with the elderly in the country,” Obasanjo said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:28:40.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
