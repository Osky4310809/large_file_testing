Credit Anthony Wallace/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Jeff Jones, Uber’s president of ride sharing, has left the company after just six months, in yet another major executive departure from the embattled company over the past month.\nLast August, Uber widely publicized the hiring of Mr. Jones, who was poached from Target. He was in charge of Uber’s branding, customer support and operations divisions.\nMr. Jones’s exit was first reported by Recode . Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, confirmed the departure in an email statement on Sunday. “We want to thank Jeff for his six months at the company and wish him all the best,” he wrote.\nMr. Jones did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe departure is the third executive exit from Uber in nearly as many weeks. Raffi Krikorian, a well-regarded director in Uber’s self-driving division, left the company last week , while Gary Marcus, who joined Uber just three months ago after Uber acquired his company, left in early March. Uber also asked for the resignation of Amit Singhal , a top Google engineer who failed to disclose a sexual harassment claim against him at his previous employer before joining Uber.\nMr. Jones’s decision to leave is particularly problematic for Uber, as many current and former employees had seen him as a natural successor or counterpart to Travis Kalanick, the company’s chief executive and co-founder. Investors and the company’s board of directors were particularly keen on stabilizing the troubled company after months of internal turmoil.\nMr. Kalanick has faced intense scrutiny in recent weeks for his role in fostering the combative and cutthroat culture of Uber’s internal operations, and has been blamed for not properly dealing with the company’s continuing human resources issues . After a video of Mr. Kalanick getting into a heated argument with a driver surfaced this month, Mr. Kalanick said he would seek leadership help. Uber is currently in the midst of a search for a chief operating officer.\n  Jones was viewed by many as the so-called adult in the room — an executive with experience as a leader at a public company that had undergone a period of intense crisis. He oversaw Target’s marketing division during and after the fallout of a major company data breach in 2013 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T03:33:19.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
