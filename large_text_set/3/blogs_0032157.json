By Wesley Yin-Poole   \nCD Projekt will host a Gwent: The Witcher Card Game technical beta on PlayStation 4 this weekend. \nYou can play the game from 6pm UK time on Friday, 31st March until 8am UK time on Monday, 3rd April. To get in all you have to do is go to the PlayStation Store and download the game (you'll need about 3GB of space). A PlayStation Plus subscription is not required. \nThe Technical Beta build lets you create your own decks, play the tutorial and online casual matches. Real currency purchases are disabled. After the beta ends, accounts will be deleted. CD Projekt said it wants the beta to test how the game works on PS4 with many users playing at the same time, so there may be technical glitches. \nBertie penned his Gwent impressions in January and he very much enjoyed the game.
