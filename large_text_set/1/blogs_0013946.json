Adults have reliquinshed their position as protectors and responsible caregivers and have become perpetrators and predators. Families and communities have lost sight of the values and sentiment that it takes a village to raise a child. Statistics on sexual assault and abuse on children from birth to the age of consent is astounding. Babies as young as 18 months have died from being sexually assaulted and 4 year olds are being treated for gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis and HIV. Many of these acts are being committed by close family members, fathers, step fathers, uncles, brothers. Lack of education is a contributing factor. We need to implement sexual abuse and assault classes and programs for children to become empowered through knowledge. Teach them what's ok and what's not, so they will know what to report to an adult. The justice and child care system, needs to act swiftly in the best interest of the victim and their family. They need to know that the system supports them. A sexual predator registry will help keep track of the predators and make families aware so they can protect their children.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T12:59:18.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
