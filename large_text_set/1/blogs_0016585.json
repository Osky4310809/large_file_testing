The project aims to recreate the feel of a video rental store from the 1990s, but only with copies of Jerry Maguire .\nEverything Is Terrible! has collected the tapes through fan donations with the eventual goal of building a pyramid in the desert “where all the world’s Jerry’s will live until the end of time,” the collective announced on its website for the project, jerrymaguirepyramid.com .\n“Seeing thousands of Jerrys finally reunited will forever destroy the viewers' previous perception of culture, waste, and existence as a whole,” the project creators wrote. “The Jerrys are a beautiful thing.”\nThe tapes are not available for rent or purchase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T03:35:26.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
