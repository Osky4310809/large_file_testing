Anthony Crolla and Jorge Linares will meet in Manchester again, on March 25 \n\"I know we've got a lot of boxing support in the UK and it's been a big, big tradition over there, so I would definitely love the opportunity to go over there and fight - for the fans I have over there. \n\"I am open to different options. I would love to unify the titles against the winner of Linares or Crolla - Linares chased the rematch again. \n\"However, I know if Crolla wins, I'll probably have to wait in line so they can have a third match. I would like to fight Terry Flanagan for the WBO title and unify the titles with his, but I know he's also got something lined up. I know we've got a lot of boxing support in the UK and it's been a big, big tradition over there, so I would definitely love the opportunity to go over there and fight Mikey Garcia \n\"I haven't really seen Campbell, but I have heard of him a few times, because he holds the lower version of the WBC. If he is a top contender and a worthy challenger then, of course, I would like to face him. \n\"I am willing to fight anyone that's available and I believe it's about giving the fight fans the best out there. I'd like a champion, so I can unify, or I'll go to the second-best option which would be the title contender.\" Luke Campbell is on Mikey Garcia's radar as the WBC Silver title holder \nGarcia did not rule out moving up to super-lightweight if there were no big fights available at 135lbs, but wants to take on the best and establish himself as America's No 1. \nThe Californian had a two-and-a-half-year break away from the sport due to a \"litigation battle\" with his former promoter but has had two fights back after winning the case. \n'Mikey' not only feels he has a second chance to reach the top, but warned the other lightweight champions and big names up at 140lbs that he is going to get even better. Mikey Garcia (R) became a three-weight world champion, adding the WBC lightweight to his collection \n\"As I keep telling everybody, you still haven't seen the best of me and the best is yet to come,\" he said. \n\"You've really got to believe that. I expect to do big things and stand out in boxing and this stage of my career is going to be the most memorable. \n\"I am just trying to win the big fights and build my legacy, to take over and be considered 'the man' and the one to bare the torch. That would be great. Upgrade now and watch Chelsea v Arsenal this weekend and get 8 Sky Sports channels! \n\"It's a very big decision and it's stacked. You've got great fighters, great champions and there's a lot of buzz in the lightweight division now I am back. I have created more buzz and I am going to keep playing. \n\"I am one of the top guys in the division, who can mix and match with the other guys to make a great match-up.\" \nWatch Jorge Linares vs Anthony Crolla II from the Manchester Arena, live on Sky Sports, on Saturday, March 25.
