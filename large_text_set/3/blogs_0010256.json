Donald Trump \nThe meeting was to be the first between the two leaders since Trump was elected in November. \nTheir itinerary was set to include discussions on NATO, ISIS, trade, the Ukraine conflict, a news conference, and a working lunch. \nThe same itinerary will occur on Friday, the rescheduled day, according to Spicer. \nTrump’s meeting with Merkel is seen as the most important meeting with a foreign leader since he took office in January. \nThe storm in Washington is expected to begin on Monday night and continue into Tuesday, the first major snowfall of the year, according to forecasts. \nThe National Weather Service forecast a winter storm warning for all six states comprising New England, all of New York and New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware. \nMajor U.S. cities including Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and Boston were included in the warning. \n“Cold air is pushing into the region from Canada, causing temperatures several degrees below normal for mid-March. \n“The so-called nor’easter will bring very heavy snow, ice, strong winds and dangerous travel conditions to the area,” the weather service said. \nIt said between 30 centimetres and 45 centimetres of snow could fall in the most heavily affected area, which the weather service said stretched from south-eastern Pennsylvania into southern New England. \n“Strong winds could down trees and cause power outages,” the weather service said. \nAbout 4,000 flights scheduled for Tuesday have already had been cancelled by most airlines while passengers who preferred refunds were refunded.
