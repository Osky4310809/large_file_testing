Shares \nThe patch notes for the upcoming Civilization 6 Spring Update break down a wide range of changes coming to the game, which 2K games said will include \"balance changes, AI adjustments, multiplayer changes, and bug fixes.\" Highlights include a Harbor buff that \"will bring the strength of the various districts in line with each other,\" and a reduction in warmonger penalties, \"so they only hit with their full strength if you are truly wresting valuable cities from your opponents.\" \nThe changed warmonger penalties will impact both your Diplomatic status and City Populations. With a few very specific exceptions, the hit to your Diplomatic status will be reduced by 20 percent if you declare war on, or capture a city from, a player you have previously denounced, or 40 percent if you take the city from someone you're already at war with. Captured cities will also suffer a reduced population loss if the city's population after it's been taken is lower than the average population of all the cities in the game. \nThe AI is also being tuned to improve to improve its performance on various fronts, and a handful of bugs (and a terribly awkward reference to Australian Prime Minister John Curtin as \"President\") have been fixed. A multiplayer issue that caused the online games list to fail to properly show all available games has been taken care of, and the list will also now show results from additional regions. \nThere's no hard date on the Civ 6 Spring Update yet, but 2K said it will hit the PC sometime this week, and don't forget that a couple of Great guys— Cyrus and Alexander —are on the way in an upcoming Civilization and Scenario pack, too. Full patch notes are available on Steam . Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:29:46.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
