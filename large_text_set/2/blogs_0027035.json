And out in the audience, Garfield appeared to be as happy as ever for his one-time love.\n#AndrewGarfield cried when #EmmaStone won her #Oscary2017 for #LaLaLand as Mia! in Los Angeles, (Feb. 26) pic.twitter.com/pck3GDzqHX \n— Andrew Garfield News (@AndrewGarfieldN) February 27, 2017 His reaction, honestly, isn’t super surprising (though we’ll never get tired of his sweet behavior!).
