And boy, do they sound good. In honor of International Women's Day , Oxford-based a cappella group The Oxford Belles released a new music video covering Cyndi Lauper's iconic song with a timely twist: \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun(damental Rights).\" The track went live on March 8 (International Women's Day) and aims to help raise money for women's rights groups Oxfordshire, The Malala Fund and Forward. Students from University and Oxford Brookes University founded the group in 1995 to bring more female representation to the music scene in Oxford. Since its inception, the women have performed all around UK for balls, parties, and events, including a performance on BBC South News. The group's first ever music video embodies those founding principles, celebrating women and their achievements. The group mainly performs \"girl power anthems\", so the Lauper hit was a natural choice. 7 inspiring TED Talks by women that everyone should watch ‘We wanted to choose a song that represented us as a group, was universally loved, and could also provide a powerful message\", said the group's president, Jess Bollands. In the video, female academics at Oxford University were asked what they would say to young women today. Each academic held up a sign with their handwritten message, calling back to handmade signs brandished at the Women's March earlier this year. The Oxford Belles shooting their music video (Oxford Belles) According to Bollands, the group hopes that the empowering message will strike a chord with audiences. \"We really hope that with the attention the video receives, the charities that we are supporting will receive vital funds to help support women’s rights, safety and education\", Bollands said. \"That would be the greatest achievement we could dream of.\" Modern feminist icons- in pictures Modern feminist icons- in pictures 1/14 Hillary Clinton \nBecause what’s more admirable than running for president of the United States not once, but twice? As First Lady, Clinton fought for gender equality and healthcare reform, issues she carried over into her role as the first female senator of New York in 2000 and later, her runs for president. In 2015, she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time, and was the first female candidate to be nominated for president in 2016. Phil Long/AP 2/14 Yoko Ono \nOno might be known for being John Lennon’s wife, but she has been an activist for peace and human rights since the 1960s.

In the years and decades following Lennon’s death, she paid for billboards and monuments to spread messages of world peace in his memory. More recently, Ono shares messages of peace through her active social media presence, offering her millions of followers poems and comments on media and politics. Dave Benett 3/14 Margaret Atwood \nIn her novels, the award-winning Canadian author sheds light on women's social oppression by portraying female characters dominated by patriarchy. One of her most famous works, “The Handmaid's Tale”, explores themes of women in subjugation and the way they work to gain agency in a dystopian society. Atwood reported that she has seen a spike in book sales for “The Handmaid’s Tale” after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. 4/14 Geena Davis \nNot only is Davis an award-winning American actress for classic films like Thelma & Louise and A League of Their Own, but an activist as well. In 2007, she launched the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, which works with the entertainment industry to both increase the presence of female characters in media and reduce stereotyping of females by the male-dominated industry. Another fun fact: Davis is a member of Mensa, a social club whose members have IQs in the top 2 percent. Jesse Grant/Getty Images 5/14 Madonna \nThe fixture of American pop music achieved popularity by pushing the boundaries of pop music, and keeping her artistic freedom in an often-pushy recording industry. Madonna is regarded as a major influence for other artists, has been referred to as \"an almost sacred feminist icon” for her sexual imagery and ability to stir conversation around the topic. Madonna has sold 300 million records worldwide, recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the best-selling female recording artist of all time. Yui Mok/PA 6/14 Alice Walker \nThe American novelist is most famous for her critically acclaimed novel The Color Purple, which was turned into a movie directed by Steven Spielberg featuring Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg, and a Broadway musical totaling 910 performances. Walker was also an activist, who credits Martin Luther King Jr. for her decision to return to the American South as a civil rights activist for the Civil Rights Movement. On March 8, 2003, on the eve of the Iraq War, (coincidentally, International Women's Day), Walker was arrested with 26 others at an anti-war rally outside the White House in Washington. D.C.

Allison Michael Orenstein 8/14 Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie \nJames Copnall wrote in the Times Literary Supplement that this Nigerian novelist was \"the most prominent\" young author to attract readers to African literature, which only begins to describe this inspiring figure. In 2012, Adichie gave an iconic TEDx talk titled \"We should all be feminists”, in which she shared her experiences of being an African feminist. Parts of Adichie's TED talk were sampled in Beyoncé's song \"Flawless”, heightening her fame further. Part of the speech was even published as a standalone essay in 2014, called “We Should All Be Feminists.” Jane Mingay/PA 9/14 Beyoncé \nAs one of the best-selling music artists of all time, “Queen Bey” (as her fans lovingly call her) is the most nominated woman in the Grammy Awards history and MTV Video Music Awards history. She is the highest-paid black musician, was listed on the Time's 100 most influential people twice, and was listed as the most powerful female in entertainment in 2015. She has sold over 100 million records as a solo artist and a further 60 million with Destiny's Child, making her truly an American icon. In 2013, Beyoncé told Vogue that she considered herself to be \"a modern-day feminist\", later sampling Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie \"We should all be feminists\" TEDx talk in her smash hit \"Flawless.” Mike Nelson/EPA 10/14 Laverne Cox \nThere is so much that makes Cox a notable feminist icon, it’s almost hard to pick which achievement is the most notable. The American actress is a notable LGBT advocate, made famous for her portrayal of Sophia Burset on the Netflix television series Orange Is the New Black. Cox was the first openly transgender person to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, and later became the first openly transgender person to have a wax figure of herself at Madame Tussauds. In 2014, Cox became the first openly transgender person to appear on the cover of Time magazine. Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images 11/14 Emma Watson \nHermoine Granger is all grown up, and she’s become a feminist icon in the process. In 2014, Watson launched her United Nationals Women campaign HeForShe, which calls upon men to advocate for equality alongside women. In the speech, she defines feminism as \"the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities.” Malala Yousafzai told Watson in 2015 that Watson is the reason she decided to call herself a feminist. Watson is also a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and was named the Feminist Celebrity of 2014 by Ms. Foundation for Women. Christophe Ena/AP 12/14 Rupi Kaur \nCanadian poet Kaur is most popular on Instagram, where she gained attention from posting photos of her poems online. Her 2015 book of prose “milk and honey” was widely successful, and brought to light important themes of femininity, loss, love, violence and abuse. Kaur was in the spotlight most recently after she posted a picture on her Instagram page of herself laying with her back toward the camera, menstrual blood showing through her sweatpants. She made a statement about how the majority of people shun this type of photo over the pornification and violence against women, and the photo was soon taken down by Instagram. The picture she shared to Facebook was shared by thousands and made headlines around the world. Later, Instagram restored her picture and apologised, claiming it had been removed by mistake. 13/14 Tavi Gevinson \nThe 20-year-old American writer and magazine editor became well known by the time she was 12 after she started her fashion blog, “Style Rookie.” “Rookie” eventually became a hugely successful online magazine aimed at teenage girls and prompting discussion of social issues and feminism.

Larry Busacca/Getty Images 14/14 Malala Yousafzi \nAt 17 years old, the Pakistani activist for female education became the youngest ever Nobel Prize laureate. Yousafzi, most famous for her book “I am Malala” is known for human rights advocacy for women in her home village in northwest Pakistan, where the local Taliban had banned girls from attending school. As she became more popular, she survived an assassination attempt by the Taliban, which sparked an international outcry and influx of support not just for her, but for other education-seeking girls in Pakistan. In 2012, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited Yousafzai while she was in the hospital and launched a petition to the UN in her name and \"in support of what Malala fought for.” The petition demanded that by 2015, no child would be left without an education.
