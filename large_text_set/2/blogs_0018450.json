Q Branch. Every time 007 finds himself in some sort of situation, it’s always gonna be an exploding pen, tricked out car or a laser watch that’s gonna get him out of shit. And while you watch those films with some disbelief, bear in mind, some of that tech was based in fact. \nThere’s actually an entire museum dedicated to top secret spy technology and gadgets called The International Spy Museum , located in Washington, DC. Inside, there’s every kind of secret trick imaginable, from hidden cameras, secret pistols and even a radio transmitter that’s designed to look like dog poop. \nPut on your best bespoke suit and head on down to the armoury for your spy gear. 2 \nButtonhole Camera, model F-21 Circa 1970 This spy tech was widely used in the Soviet Union, Europe and the U.S. Codenamed ‘Ajax,’ the camera’s trigger was held in the pocket, and a camera lens was hidden within a button in a regular coat. Gotta look sharp and dress the part, eh? 3 \nTree Stump Listening Device Early 1970s Designed and used by the CIA, this stump would be placed near a Soviet base and used to intercept radio transmissions. The data would then be sent up to a CIA satellite and beamed to the U.S. 4 \nLipstick Pistol Circa 1965 While this lipstick looked ordinary, it was designed and used by the KGB during the Cold War and was capable of firing a deadly .177 round. \nWonder how many spies accidentally shot themselves in the face with this? 5 \nEyeglasses with Concealed Cyanide Pills Circa 1975-1977 You always hope that every mission goes according to plan, but sometimes you get caught and disavowed. In the case of a compromised agent, the CIA required that you chose death over torture and issued hidden Cyanide pills inside of the arm. All you had to do was chew on your glasses and you were taking your secrets to the grave.
