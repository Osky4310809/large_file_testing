Well, until a football challenge is put in front of them, that is. \nThe former England internationals were guests on Play to the Whistle, which was broadcast on ITV last night. Oh Alan Shearer, what have you done? (Photo: ITV) \nAnd well, with the duo on the show, the producers were hardly going to miss the opportunity to pit them against each other now, were they? \nA penalty shootout was the challenge selected, but who would go in goal? Well, audience member David Seaman, of course. Frank Lampard hasn't lost it (Photo: ITV) \nFortunately for everyone who was lucky enough to be at the recording of the show, the former Arsenal shot-stopper just happened to be in the audience! What are the chances? \nHe took his place between the goal posts and pulled his gloves on in preparation of the pair firing balls at him. The former Chelsea man has scored more penalties for England than anyone else (Photo: Reuters) \nAs show host Holly Willoughby pointed out ahead of the game, Lampard has scored the most penalties for England, Shearer has netted more in the Premier League and Seaman has won a shoot-out in goal for the national team - by far the most impressive stat there. \nSo the challenge was expected to be a good one... Shearer was prolific in front of goal for Newcastle (Photo: Getty) \nShearer was first up, and well, probably wished he hadn't bothered agreeing to come on the show, before Lampard stepped up to the plate and delivered. \nSeaman then saved Shearer's second spot-kick, after his first attempt went miles wide, before the former Chelsea man found the back of the net again. \nWho would have thought it, eh?
