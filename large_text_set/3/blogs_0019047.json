They’re at loggerheads and Chas is determined that she isn’t going to make up with Faith because she is convinced that she doesn’t need her mother in her life. She would much rather Faith just went back to wherever she came from and isn’t keen on her being in the village, wheedling her way back into the family.\n(Picture: ITV) ‘I definitely don’t think she’d be at all bothered if Faith got the next bus out of the village!’\nHowever, the discussion might take an interesting turn as Sally added to Inside Soap : ‘Ah, but then Chas discovers something about Faith that alters the whole situation again and it’s all quite serious but we can’t tell you anything more than that for now…\n(Picture: ITV) ‘I think all Faith wants it to be accepted; she just wants to belong to a family and have a place to call home – it’s a big thing for her!’\nCan Chas and Faith restore their fractured relationship in the make or break chat? Or will Chas head out of the village with things more tense between them than ever?\nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Devastating news for Liv Flaherty leads to a double exit \nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Aaron Dingle to be released in weeks – but will he have a marriage to return to?
