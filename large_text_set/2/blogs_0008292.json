Typically, these ETFs track a family of stocks, which all rise and fall based on the commodity trading price of gold. \nThese are the 5 largest gold ETFs by average volume as of December 13, 2016. Note that we’re comparing the trading volume of the ETFs themselves, rather than the volume of assets under management . SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) Issuer: State Street Global Advisors Average Volume: 9,800,000 shares 2016 YTD Performance: 8.81% Expense Ratio: 0.40% \nFormerly the top-trading ETF in the world by volume, SPDR Gold Shares has fallen out of the top 10 in recent years. But it’s still a high-volume fund with excellent performance and a low expense ratio as compared to other precious metals ETFs. This exchange-traded fund has the highest average volume of any gold ETF currently traded. \nUnlike other ETFs on this list, GLD trades in bullion directly. Each share is meant to track the price of one-tenth of an ounce of gold. If the share prices spike and outperform gold, the manager of this fund exchanges blocks of 100,000 shares for 10,000 ounces of gold. \nAs of the beginning of the year, this fund owned over 21 million ounces of gold bullion and had in excess of $23 billion under management. iShares Gold Trust ( IAU ) 2016 YTD Performance: 9.09% Expense Ratio: 0.25% \niShares formed its Gold Trust ETF as a direct competitor to State Street’s Gold Shares ETF, and in many ways, it has outperformed the other fund. IAU is second in average volume, but it leads the rest of the pack by millions of shares. \nIAU has an extremely low expense ratio and a proven track record of exceptional performance. Like State Street’s Gold Shares fund, iShares Gold Trust is unique in that it holds physical gold rather than stock in companies that mine and refine raw gold. \nThis fund has $7.4 billion in of assets under management, which equates to roughly 7 million ounces of bullion in its vaults. VelocityShares 3X Long Gold ( UGLD ) Issuer: Credit Suisse 2016 YTD Performance: 16.69% Expense Ratio: 1.35% \nThe VelocityShares Triple Long Gold Fund takes an optimistic position on the price of gold. Since the price of gold rose in 2016, and since this is a triple-long fund designed to amplify the gains in the gold market as a whole, it was the best-yielding fund on this list by far. (See also: What Drives The Price Of Gold? ) \nThis gold ETF is an excellent fund for anyone who is bullish on the rising cost of gold. Although it’s a moderate-volume fund, UGLD had an excellent 2016. It’s not as large or heavily-traded as some on this list, but it outperformed all of them in 2016. DB Gold Double Short ( DZZ ) Issuer: PowerShares 2016 YTD Performance: -23.90% Expense Ratio: 0.75% \nThe DB Gold Double Short fund takes the opposite approach of UGLD. This fund takes an aggressively short position on the price of gold. As such, it had a difficult time turning a profit in a market that’s mostly seen a slow rise without too many sudden falls – which short funds rely on to make money. \nRegardless of its 2016 performance, DZZ is a moderate-volume fund that’s designed to deliver good returns as the price of gold falls. If you’re an investor who’s counting on the cost of a troy ounce plunging, this fund is a good choice. VanEck Merk Gold Trust ( OUNZ ) Issuer: Merk Funds 2016 YTD Performance: 8.94% Expense Ratio: 0.40% \nOUNZ is a traditional, if small, gold ETF. The fund enjoyed good performance in 2016, and although it doesn’t have the amount of assets under management that larger funds do, it was able to turn a profit through smart investing. \nAnother moderate-volume fund, OUNZ is still the fifth-largest gold ETF on the Street. At just over $152 million in the fund, it’s got a fair amount of assets under management. It's set up in a way that’s comparable to the iShares Gold Trust and SPDR Gold Shares funds, but its smaller size makes OUNZ less able to take advantage of favorable price fluctuations.
