Dave Trott (R-Mich.) while waving red flags directly after he said he supports the portion of President Donald Trump’s budget that increases military funding. \nHowever, it wasn’t the only time the attendees gave Trott grief. According to Michigan Radio , the attendees also booed and jeered when Trott said he would be voting for the Republican plan to replace Obamacare, called the American Health Care Act, later this week. \nAccording to Michigan Live , the Oakland County Republican Party later accused the Democratic Party of sending liberal activists to the town hall to snub Trott. \n“The Democratic Party will say and do anything to undermine President Trump’s Administration, the Republican Party, and their supporters,” an email sent following the town hall read. “One of their main tactics right now is attending our Republican elected officials Town Halls and Coffee Hours and shouting and heckling our legislators.” \nAccording to the Daily Caller News Foundation , many of the liberal activists were from the progressive activist group Michigan People’s Campaign. \nSaturday’s town hall was Trott’s first since being re-elected in November. According to his spokeswoman, Katie Vincentz, Trott has been absent in his district because of his “robust” schedule in Washington. However, Trott already has a second town hall scheduled for early April. \nThe town hall was filled with about 500 attendees despite nearly 1,000 people showing up, meaning security had to turn many away, according to Michigan Live. \nTrott, a successful businessman and lawyer before entering Congress, is in his second term.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:47:25.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
