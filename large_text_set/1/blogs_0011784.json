It's a hell of a hoot,\"Mattis said. \"It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling.\" Marine Gen. James Mattis, second from right, now retired, aboard the USS Peleliu in the Arabian Sea in November 2001. Jim Hollander / EPA \nMattis, however, was also widely hailed for hiring experts on the Middle East to train his men and women in cultural sensitivity after an internal survey showing that many Marines wouldn't report a colleague for abusing civilians. \n\"Whenever you show anger or disgust toward civilians, it's a victory for al-Qaeda and other insurgents,\" he told Marines in 2007 at Camp Gannon in Iraq near the Syrian border. \nBut Mattis, who last served as commander of U.S. Central Command, faces two difficult hurdles on his path to confirmation. \nFirst, Mattis needs a waiver from the law that bars recently retired military officers from leading the Pentagon. He retired in 2013, well short of the seven-year requirement. \nThat has happened only once before, in 1950, when President Harry Truman nominated Gen. George Marshall, who was Army chief of staff during World War II, to be defense secretary. \nWhile the House of Representatives has no formal role in confirming Cabinet nominees, it would have to join the Senate in approving a waiver for Mattis. And that's not a given. Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for defense secretary, arrives for a meeting with Senate Armed Services Committee Kirsten Gillibrand last week in Washington, D.C. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nHouse Democrats said many members of their party were distressed at the cancellation of Mattis' scheduled appearance Thursday before a House Armed Services Committee hearing on civilian control of the military. \nRep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said Trump's transition team canceled Mattis' appearance without explanation. He encouraged his Democratic colleagues to vote \"no\" on granting the waiver \"if we don't hear from him.\" \nA Democratic spokesperson for the committee told NBC News that the hearing had been canceled because of Mattis' non-appearance. The full House is scheduled to vote on the waiver Friday. \n\"This is not a minor issue,\" the spokesperson said. \"This is a major issue affecting the principle of civilian control of the military.\" \nThen there is the alleged blot on Mattis' otherwise sterling record that is likely to come up at his confirmation hearing. \nA former Army Special Forces officer has accused Mattis of \"leaving my men to die\" after they were hit by friendly fire while fighting in Afghanistan in 2001.
