[Chuckles] \n\"So we went to the Hard Rock, there was nobody in there, they had this small little stage, and we just kept drinking and drinking until we decided it was a good idea to get up onstage and play one of our fuckin' songs. [Chuckles] \n\"Apparently, they thought we were just gonna go up there, turn it way down and not be annoying at all. But we were very annoying apparently, to all 6 people in there. \n\"There weren't many people there at all, but they just looked in horror, complained, and then we got shut down... DURING MY SOLO!\" \nThe guitarist added: \"We thought it would be ironic to be at the Hard Rock and not get recognized and actually get kicked off stage - we thought that would be pretty funny. And it happened!\" \nIn case you missed it, you can check out the footage below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:20:16.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
