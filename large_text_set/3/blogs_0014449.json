However, whoever stole the laptop could access classified data.\nABC News:\n\"The U.S. Secret Service can confirm that an employee was the victim of a criminal act in which our Agency issued laptop computer was stolen,\" the agency said in a statement on Friday.\n\"Secret Service-issued laptops contain multiple layers of security including full disk encryption and are not permitted to contain classified information,\" the statement continued.\nThe agency said an investigation is ongoing and that it would withhold further comment \"until the facts are gathered.\"\nAuthorities are still searching for the laptop, according to law enforcement sources. Police expect to quickly identify the suspect from video evidence, the sources said.\nThe computer is encrypted and authorities are able to wipe the hard drive remotely if needed.\nThe device, which belonged to a female Secret Service agent, was stolen during a break-in in Brooklyn, New York, law enforcement sources said. The burglary happened Thursday morning at 8:40 a.m. in the Bath Beach section of Brooklyn.\nPolice are still working to identify the perpetrator.\nWe'd like to think that anything that would compromise the security of the president would not be on that laptop. But given all we know about lax security procedures of government officials and agencies, nothing should be taken for granted. The gigantic hack of the Office of Personnel Management computers revealed information that should never have been on a poorly secured network. That sort of arrogance permeates government agencies.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/17/secret-service-laptop-containing-sensitive-info-stolen-in-new-york/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/secret-service-laptop-trump-tower-floor-plans-details/story?id=46204467", "http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/opm-hack-government-finally-starts-notifying-21-5-million-victims-n437126"], "published": "2017-03-17T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:41:14.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
