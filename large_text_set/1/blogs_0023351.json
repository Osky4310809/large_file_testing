This could mean learning a new skill , boning up on what you already know , or finding new work or projects you can take on. 2:30 p.m. Make yourself more visible Skye Gould/Business Insider \nYou may already have help with social media, but every small-business owner needs to think about how you're perceived by the rest of the world. \nMentoring and giving back to the community are a couple of good ways to build your external career capital. 3:30 p.m. Take a walk Skye Gould/Business Insider \nGetting natural sunlight and a little exercise are great ways to boost alertness and add to your energy level during your midday break. 4:00 p.m. Leave this time open Skye Gould/Business Insider \nThings will crop up throughout the day that need dedicated time for addressing — now's the time to mop up anything that needs attending to. 5:00 p.m. Plan for what's ahead Skye Gould/Business Insider \nFigure out your top-three priorities for the next day and if you need to realign anything. Or, if you plan to do work later in the evening, know ahead of time your strategy for getting it done efficiently. 6:00 p.m. Disconnect from work Skye Gould/Business Insider \nWhether you want to spend time with the family, hang out with friends, volunteer, or relax by yourself, your personal time shouldn't involve any work. 8:30 p.m. Log back on, briefly Skye Gould/Business Insider \nSome small-business owners, and working people in general, find it hard to completely log off after work. Take an hour for mop-up work, creative thinking, or reading for work. 9:30 p.m. Shut down Skye Gould/Business Insider \nClose the laptop, put the phone down, and take a little more personal time before bed. Sleep needs vary from person to person, but a solid seven hours is a good place to start.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T01:40:25.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
