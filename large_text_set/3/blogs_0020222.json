It’s slim, versatile, and has a vintage feel that is unmistakably authentic. It’s called the 501 Skinny and it might just be your new favorite pair of jeans.\nIt’s based on the classic 501 Original — a favorite of pioneers, rebels, rockstars since its very creation — but comes with a skinnier leg and a much more contemporary feel.\nArriving in a range of washes in either non-stretch or low-stretch denim, the 501 Skinny can be paired with pretty much anything in your wardrobe — and they won’t cling to your legs when the warmer weather finally arrives.\nIts low-key silhouette is understated and sophisticated, yet its smaller details and that little red tab are enough to add a touch of swagger.\nThe 501 Skinny joins the 501 Original and the 501 CT in the 501 family. Next to the 501 Skinny, Levi’s is remastering other iconic styles for this season, including the new Levi’s Sportswear Logo Shirt, originally worn by U.S. athletes at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.\nAll styles can be purchased right now over at the Levi’s webstore.\nShop Here (Germany) Shop Here (US) After you’ve copped, check out what happened when Levi’s Made & Crafted headed to Cuba for SS17 .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:29:58.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
