But we just heard that Sia stepped out in public without her signature wig and our minds are blown way out to the stratosphere.\nSeriously, we barely recognized her — that wig-based privacy plan works VERY well (okay some people recognized her because there were cameras ready to snap the moment, but still!). Let’s back up a minute and examine how we usually see Sia , because her unique stage persona is part of her massive appeal.\nvia GIPHY The wigless sighting happened at LAX, where Sia was traveling to Dubai for her concert at the Dubai World Cup.\nAs you can see, she’s pretty unrecognizable. starzfly/Bauer-Griffin/Getty Images But hey, we love it! And now that we know what Sia actually looks like, maybe she’ll go uncovered more often? Either way we’re on board with you, Sia!\nAlso, we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention how much we’re loving this monochromatic travel ensemble. It’s comfy-casual yet perfectly pulled together. There’s nothing fussy here; she left her hair down, applied minimal makeup, and threw on some sneakers. Easy peasy.\n\nEven though Sia recently split from husband Erik Lang, there’s lots of exciting stuff coming up for her. Her seventh album This is Acting is doing really well, and we just hope there are more tours on the horizon!\nSia fans in Dubai sure are lucky, because her live shows are out of this world.\nSia's making her #UAEdebut at the #DubaiWorldCup on March 25th @ Meydan Racecourse!

We’re down with everything Sia, with or without the wig!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:01:30.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
