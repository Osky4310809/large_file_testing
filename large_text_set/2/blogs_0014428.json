Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide accumulate in the atmosphere and trap heat that normally would exit into outer space. Greenhouse Gases and Global Climate Change \nWhile many greenhouse gases occur naturally and are needed to create the greenhouse effect that keeps the Earth warm enough to support life, human use of fossil fuels is the main source of excess greenhouse gases. By driving cars, using electricity from coal-fired power plants, or heating our homes with oil or natural gas , we release carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. \nDeforestation is another significant source of greenhouse gases, as exposed soils release carbon dioxide, and fewer trees means less carbon dioxide conversion to oxygen. \nThe production of cement involves a chemical reaction responsible for a surprisingly large amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere every year. \ncontinue reading below our video How to Help Reduce Greenhouse Gases \nDuring the 150 years of the industrial age, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 31 percent. Over the same period, the level of atmospheric methane, another important greenhouse gas, has risen by 151 percent, mostly from agricultural activities such as raising cattle and growing rice. Methane leaks at natural gas wells are another major contributor to climate change. \nThere are steps we can take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our life, encourage carbon emission reduction programs , methane emission reduction laws , and we can support global climate change mitigation projects. Can Natural Sun Cycles Explain Global Climate Change? \nIn short, no. There are variation in the amount of energy we receive from the sun due to factors like orbital patterns and sun spots, but none which can explain the current warming, according to the IPCC . Direct Effects of Global Climate Change Many of the effects of climate change can be tied directly to some very important changes in our atmosphere Because of important gas and heat transfers between the atmosphere and sea water, a suite of: changes in the oceans ave been observed The frozen parts of the Earth are especially vulnerable to climate change. The latest IPCC report explained the impacts on the world's polar ice caps, glaciers, and permafrost The Consequences of Global Warming \nThe increase in trapped heat changes the climate and alters weather patterns, which may change the timing of seasonal natural events , and the frequency of extreme weather events . Polar ice is vanishing , and sea levels are rising , causing coastal flooding. Climate change leads to food security , and even national security , concerns. Agricultural practices have been affected, including the production of maple syrup . \nThere are also health consequences to climate change. Warmer winters allow for range expansions of white-tailed deer and deer ticks, increasing the incidence of Lyme disease .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:14:57.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
