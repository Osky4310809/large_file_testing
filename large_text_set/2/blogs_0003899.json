One brand noticeably left out of the conversation? Victoria’s Secret. Though the intimates retailer has come under fire time and time again for promoting an unrealistic ideal body image (that of the ultrathin Victoria’s Secret “Angel”), the company hasn’t made any moves to become more inclusive—a fact made painfully clear by one plus-size shopper’s discouraging experience at the brand’s Cardiff, Wales store earlier this week.

While she was looking around, she realized that there wasn’t anything available in her size; in fact, she didn’t see a single XL in the entire store. Still, she was content with browsing, until an employee approached her and rudely asked: “Hi…Are you aware of the sizing in this store?” Walsh-Greenfield, who is a size 20, felt the employee was body-shaming her.

Still, she recalls, “I shuffled away, with my tail between my legs. I didn’t even want to hold the shorts anymore.... My friend, upon discussion once leaving the shop after making her purchase, was livid. Her experience ruined. She wanted to ring the head office or go back into the store to make a complaint…. I didn’t want to go back to complain, I didn’t feel welcome.” More body-positive campaigns we're loving:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:10:27.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
