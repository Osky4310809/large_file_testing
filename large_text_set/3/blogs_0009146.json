(Photo: David Wallace/The Republic) 147 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAfter an unusually emotional debate Thursday, the Arizona Senate rejected a proposal to keep convicted felons who are in the country illegally locked up longer than U.S. citizens. \nDemocrats and three moderate Republicans voted against the bill. Meanwhile, some of the chamber's most conservative members criticized them as families of individuals killed by undocumented immigrants watched from the gallery above. \n​Senate Bill 1279 would have required immigrants who are in the country illegally and who are convicted of a felony to serve their entire sentence before being released to federal immigration officials for deportation proceedings. U.S. citizens convicted of a felony in Arizona must serve 85 percent of their sentences before they are eligible for early release. \n\"We want justice for citizens,\" said Sen. Steve Smith, R-Maricopa, the sponsor of Senate Bill 1279. \"That's what this bill attempts to speak to.\" ​Senate Bill 1279 \nThe bill would have required convicted felons who are in the country illegally to serve their entire sentence before being released to federal immigration officials for deportation proceedings. \nSmith, an immigration hard-liner, said the intent is to help prevent violent felons from leaving prison early and possibly hurting or killing another person while they await deportation proceedings. He named the bill \"Grant's Law,\" after 21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, who was shot and killed in 2015 while working at a QuikTrip in Mesa. \nThe man charged with killing Ronnebeck, Apolinar Altamirano, 29, was in the country illegally and was released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on bail pending an immigration hearing. But it doesn't appear that SB 1279 would have applied to Altamirano. He wasn't released early from prison, but was on supervised probation for a prior burglary-related conviction when Ronnebeck was killed. \nImmigrant-rights groups and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona have said the legislation is unconstitutional, would inflate the state's prison population and give Arizona another black eye on immigration issues. \nRELATED: Will 325k undocumented Arizonans trust the police? \nThe legislation isn't as sweeping as Arizona's landmark immigration-enforcement law, Senate Bill 1070. But it drew fire from critics who say it could mark a return of legislative efforts to punish people more harshly based on immigration status, particularly in light of President Donald Trump's focus on immigration issues. Floor vote gets heated \nSen. Steve Smith. (Photo: The Republic) \nSmith and Senate leadership knew the bill may not have had enough votes to pass Thursday, but elected to place it in front of the full Senate anyway. It failed 14-16. \nSmith invited several families of individuals killed by people in the country illegally to watch the vote from the public gallery above the Senate floor. Among the small group of victims' families was Ronnebeck's father, Steve, and brother, Tyler. As the vote board lit up with more red \"no\" votes than green \"yes\" votes, Smith repeatedly pointed at and referred to the families. “It's just sad that we have a bill that will directly help families in our state and in our country and because of one political pressure or another, that I haven't heard yet, you're going to go ahead and defeat this bill. If that sits well with your conscience, let it sit.” Sen. Steve Smith \n\"Steve Ronnebeck is in the gallery. I can't tell you the amount of pain he's gone through. Grant's brother, Tyler, it's his birthday today,\" Smith said, turning to the families. \"I want to apologize on behalf of our state. Once again, you have asked, but your representatives have not delivered for you. Some may think it's more justice to take care of a criminally convicted illegal alien than providing justice for your children.\" \nSmith's comments targeting lawmakers, as opposed to the bill's merits, were a striking departure from typical Senate floor decorum. He focused his criticism for the \"no\" votes on the three Republicans — Sen. Bob Worsley, R-Mesa; Sen. Kate Brophy McGee, R-Phoenix; and Sen. Frank Pratt, R-Casa Grande. \n\"Maybe some people think, 'Here we go again with an immigration bill in Arizona and it just might not give us the best look out there,'\" he said. \"It's just sad that we have a bill that will directly help families in our state and in our country and because of one political pressure or another, that I haven't heard yet, you're going to go ahead and defeat this bill. If that sits well with your conscience, let it sit.\" \nSen. Sonny Borrelli, R-Lake Havasu City, and Sen. Sylvia Allen, R-Snowflake, also apologized to the families on behalf of the \"no\" votes. \n\"It's always comes down to politics,\" Allen said. \nPREVIOUS: AZ lawmaker wants undocumented immigrants locked up longer \nThe three Republicans sat quietly, sometimes with their heads bowed. The Democrats who voted against the bill also did not speak. \nAfter the vote, Worsley told The Arizona Republic that he believes immigration is a federal issue and is getting attention at that level. “I feel horrible about what has happened to Grant and these families, but I truly believe this bill is unconstitutional.” Sen. Kate Brophy McGee \n\"Trump is targeting criminals and will deport them, so why are we living in the SB 1070 years still?\" he said. \"We need to get behind our new president. This is being addressed.\" \nBrophy McGee told The Republic she did not believe the bill was constitutional because it would require a state judge to intervene in federal immigration issues. \n\"I've been a consistent 'no' on this legislation for the last two years,\" she said. \"I feel horrible about what has happened to Grant and these families, but I truly believe this bill is unconstitutional.\" \nPratt did not respond to a request for comment. Democrats angered \nSenate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs, D-Phoenix, and other lawmakers told The Republic after the vote that they were furious with Smith's display. “He used them for his own political purposes. That is shameful.” Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs \n\"One of the things Smith said was to apologize to the victims' families for having to relive their tragedies,\" Hobbs said. \"He is the one who put them in that position. He brought them there, knowing full well that he didn't have the votes. He used them for his own political purposes. That is shameful.\" \nSen. Steve Farley, D-Tucson, after the vote said it was sad to see lawmakers use victims' pain to try to push through their agenda. \n\"That's not the best of what we do here,\" he said. \"The bill sponsor and other members were impugning people on the floor by saying people were voting no for cynical, political reasons. That is disrespectful to the people who have different opinions.\" \nRELATED: Help with Trump immigration orders? AZ police not volunteering \nSmith said the three Republicans had told him they were probably 'no' votes but he believed one had considered switching, and he said he had one Democrat who also indicated he or she may support the bill. \n\"I didn't just put it up there for the sole purpose of putting it up there,\" Smith said later. \"I legitimately thought we had a shot at 16 (votes).\" A step further \nSB 1279 would have expanded a law the Legislature passed and Gov. Doug Ducey signed last year. That law requires immigrants in the country illegally to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences before the Arizona Department of Corrections can release them to ICE for deportation, the same length required of U.S. citizens. \nBefore last year, these immigrants could serve half their sentences before released under certain circumstances. Smith said federal officials were letting out individuals whose deportation hearings could be years away. \nRELATED: Lawsuit challenges sheriff's new ICE handoff \nDucey last year said the new law was about \"fairness and holding everyone to the same standard of justice by eliminating a policy that currently results in two justice systems.\" \nSmith said he may try to find a way to push the bill through in another format in the House this session or would try again next year. \n\"I owe it to the families to not stop trying,\" he said. 147 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2mru1vi TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T07:59:48.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
