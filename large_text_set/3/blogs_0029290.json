MUST READ Shiv Sena wants RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat as next President of India â€“ here's why \nStressing on Bhagwat's name, Raut said, ''It is the highest post in the country. Somebody with a clean image should occupy it. We have heard Mohan Bhagwat's name is being discussed for President. He is good choice for the post.'' \nBhagwat's elevation as President will help BJP-led NDA realise its dream of making India a 'Hindu Rashtra', he added. \nHowever, Raut cautioned that the decision (to support his candidature) will be taken by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. \n\"This has been discussed in our party. Even Sena President Uddhav Thackeray is of the opinion that for making India a `Hindu Rashtra`, Bhagwat should be made the President,\" Raut told mediapersons. \nHe said a staunch Hindu nationalist like Modi is the Prime Minister and another Hindutva proponent, Yogi Adityanath, had become Chief Minister of India`s most populous state Uttar Pradesh. \n\"He (Bhagwat) is a strong leader, staunch nationalist, has a deep knowledge of the Constitution. So if the BJP wants to make India a `Hindu Rashtra`, his name must be considered. He is the most suitable candidate,\" Raut said. \nBorn in Chandrapur in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, Bhagwat, 66, has headed the RSS since March 2009. \nThe presidential election is due in July. \nWhen asked if he will attend the dinner hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Raut said that the Shiv Sena has not received any invitation so far. \nThe Presidential elections will be held in July when President Pranab Mukherjee will complete his term. \nAccording to reports, names of Sushma Swaraj, Sumitra Mahajan and LK Advani are also being considered by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the President's job.   12:28 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:46:42.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
