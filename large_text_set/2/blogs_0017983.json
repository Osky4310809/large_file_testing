Photo by Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net \nStar forward Marc Pingris had nothing to be ashamed of despite the Hotshots losing Game 7 of their semifinals series against the Barangay Ginebra Gin Kings on Tuesday night. \nStar dropped an 89-76 decision to Ginebra, but Pingris kept his head high. \n“I’m proud, really proud of the team and really proud of my teammates,” Pingris said in Filipino. “I also want to thank coach (Chito Victolero) for doing his best.” ADVERTISEMENT \nPingris has been Star’s most consistent player in the semis and in Game 7, he also helped Star come back from 15 points down after posting 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists. \nWith Pingris anchoring the team in the second half, Star pulled to within three, 68-65, with still 10 minutes left. \nThe only problem for Star was it shot itself in the foot after coming off a slow start. \n“They (Ginebra) were really the more aggressive team. Our defense was non-existent this game,” Pingris said. \nStill, Pingris believes it’s only a matter of time before the Hotshots regain their lost glory. \n“Coach told us this team will go a long way. We’ll just have to grow more as a team.” \nThe last time Purefoods was on top of the PBA mountain was back in 2014 where the franchise won four straight championships under Tim Cone, who is now with Ginebra. \nPingris and Cone shared a total of five titles together and a tight hug before the final buzzer sounded in Game 7. \n“I just told him I’m so proud of him and I miss him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:30:16.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
