I am a Constitutional– you know someone that loves the Constitution, ” Lahren said. “I am someone that's for limited government, so I can’t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I’m for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies.”\nHer comments did not go over well with her co-workers at The Blaze, as it was reported on Monday that her talk show is being suspended for at least a week effective Monday, according to the Daily Caller . \nLahren’s show is suspended for effect for at least one week starting Monday, according to TheDC’s sources. A source with direct knowledge of the situation previously told TheDC that Lahren’s contract with the company goes until September, but that she may leave the company before then.\nLahren’s inflammatory style placed her at odds with other employees at The Blaze, as previously reported by TheDC. Tensions were high between Lahren and her coworkers at The Blaze even before she called pro-life conservatives hypocrites in an appearance on ABC’s “The View” on Friday.\nIn her appearance on The View, Lahren said she is pro-choice and called pro-lifer conservatives hypocrites, saying, “I can’t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I’m for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies.”\nLahren defended her pro-choice stance on Twitter.\nI speak my truth. If you don't like it, tough. I will always be honest and stand in my truth.\n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017 \n“I have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker,” Lahren added.\nLeon Wolf, managing editor of The Blaze, confirmed to CNNMoney that Lahren's show would not be airing for a week.\nAround the time her show normally aired, Lahren fired off a motivational tweet.\n\"When people praise you, don't let it go to your head. When people criticize you, don't let it go to your heart.\" #mondaymotivation \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 20, 2017 \n\nThe post Tomi Lahren’s Show Doesn’t Air After Reports Surface She’s Been Suspended appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:22:58.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
