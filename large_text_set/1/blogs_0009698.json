New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: [MOD] LGA775 Support For LGA771 Xeon CPUs Select All Posts By This User Hi everyone! I have been following a thread started a while ago about an awesome mod that is super simple and gives new life to the LGA775 platform. The original thread has become cluttered and the original poster hasn't updated his posts so I figured I would put together all of the findings into one thread to help any one interested. If you are interested in this mod, this is the place to find all the information you need about it! Overview This mod is for LGA775 motherboards only! It allows the use of LGA771 Xeon CPU's that are very affordable and powerful in many LGA775 motherboards with a few small modifications to the motherboard and CPU. How does it work? We are using a small sticker to flip two pins on the bottom of the CPU, then rotating the CPU to the correct position on in a LGA775 motherboard. If you want a more in-depth explanation, check this thread out: Explanation Why would I want to do this? Many people simply do not have the money to dump their old rig and buy a new one. The LGA775 platform has began to show its age in recent games and programs with most consumer processors. LGA771 Xeon processors are very affordable and blow most consumer level LGA775 cpu's out of the water. For example, a Xeon X5460 can be had for around $40. For $40 you can get a quad core CPU with 12mb of cache that runs at 3.16GHz stock. You also must remember that these CPU's were meant for servers, which means they are binned higher than the consumer level or even the extreme edition LGA775 CPU's. This usually equates to better overclocks and lower operating temperatures. Compatibility The following boards/chipsets have been proven compatible: Choosing the right motherboard for this mod is extremely important. Some boards need a simple microcode update while others will not post with the Xeon CPU's at all. I will attempt to create the most complete compatibility chart I can, but also take a look at post #3 and see if your board is listed. If you are running a motherboard with the X38, X48, Q35, or Q45 chipset there is a high chance it may not be compatible with this mod! The Mod Before you modify your motherboard, update your bios to the latest version if you haven't already. Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any damage you may do to your motherboard or CPU while performing this mod! First gather the necessary tools and components: A sharp knife: Xacto, box cutter, or anything similar A LGA775 motherboard with a compatible Chipset A LGA771 Xeon CPU A \"Pin Mod\" Sticker Link 1 Optional: A well lit room or a lamp to light up your work space Lets start with the motherboard. First located the two CPU guides in the CPU socket: Now use your knife and cut them both off Once you do that you are done with half the mod! Now get your CPU and \"Pin Mod\" stickers, tweezers come in handy when applying the stickers And stick the sticker on with the little triangle facing the triangle on the bottom of the CPU Now make sure when placing the CPU into the socket you line up the triangle on the CPU and the triangle on the socket! You did it! Now put your system back together and get to overclocking! Conclusion If you made it this far, you either completed the mod or have read through the thread and are still unsure about it. If you have completed the mod, make a post sharing your success, it will help get others to try the mod for themselves. If you still aren't unsure about it, have a look at some of the others who have done completed the mod. Quote: Originally Posted by Servos Weirdest/best upgrade deal I've ever made. Sold my q6700 enough to buy a e5440, the adapter, some mayhems dye (for main computer). And hands down the e5440>q6700 Well the evga 780i seems to play nice with the E5440. I oc'ed it to 4.0ghz, but my vdroop was pretty bad. Didn't crash, but ibt faild after 2-3 tests. So stuck it at 3.2 for 1:1 fsb:ram. The crasiest part is the temps. I let this go for about an hour and nothing hits over 55*c (even at 4.0ghz). I thought maybe it realtemp was misreading the sensor, but I felt the exhaust and it wasn't particularly over-wam. My q6700 was hotter under load stock. Didn't realize I was using old bios too, off to flash em. bumped it up to 3.4ghz, somehow I had the multi at 8 instead of 8.5.

I wasnt expecting it to work though on the 680i since it didnt officially support 45nm Yorkfield quad cores. Going to start testing overclocks with it next to see how high it can go, i wonder if it will overclock as nice as the Q6600s. Thanks so much to all who contributed to this thread Edit: alright just got it up and running on my XFX 780i also, running bios P09. I think this engineering sample X5460 might have an unlocked multi because its letting me select any multiplier i want Quote: Originally Posted by TB13 So, I posted on bios-mods.com earlier today and never got a reply. Being incredibly impatient and bored I decided to try and mod the BIOS myself, I'll let the picture do the rest of the talking... So ladies and gents, if anyone here needs a BIOS modded to support Xeons or other 775 CPU's let me know and I can do it. I'll be back later with some overclocking results Quote: Bump for this thread! These guys showed up this afternoon and I got to installing them They are somewhat like the ones OP had, but they do not need to be cut and have adhesive pre applied. Peel the adhesive, mod the socket, and drop it in. Bam, quad core awesomeness! Booted up no problem on my Foxconn G31 board. Its running a bit warm, but I will pick up a new heatsink sometime soon and hopefully overclock it a bit.
