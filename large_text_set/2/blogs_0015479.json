The film, which was selected to open South by Southwest, will be premiering at the festival, which feels wildly appropriate since it takes place amid Austin’s music scene. The movie, which hits theaters March 17, chronicles the relationship of two couples as they try to find success in the dizzying landscape of Austin’s creative music scene.\nThe couples deal with seduction and betrayal, and by the look of the trailer, a few wild adventures as well. The movie also features a star-studded musical cast — Iggy Pop, Black Lips and Red Hot Chili Peppers all make appearances. Arcade Fire, Iron & Wine and Neon Indians are also rumored to have filmed scenes for the movie as well.\n#songtosong Checkout link in bio \nA post shared by Michael Fassbender (@fassbender_m) on Feb 16, 2017 at 8:18pm PST \nWe love that this movie feels like the rebellious teen sister of La La Land, starring indie rockers instead of jazz musicians. Although we loved Ryan Gosling in the flick, we’re also excited to see what he brings to Song to Song. \nA post shared by Rooney Mara Fan Club Italy (@rooneymaraitaly) on Feb 17, 2017 at 2:58pm PST \nWith such a stellar cast, we’re sure this film won’t disappoint.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:06:14.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
