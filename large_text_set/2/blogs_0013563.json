Bad luck strikes for Leanne in Coronation Street this week when the elevator at Victoria Court shudders to a halt and her waters break. \nNo doubt her labour was partly brought on by the stress of sister Toyah shouting at her for making a thoughtless jibe about her being childless. \nNow the sisters-at-war have a bigger problem: Leanne can’t get an epidural. And who wants a baby to be brought into the world in a grotty lift? (Clue: TV producers!) \nFortunately Robert hears Leanne’s cries and goes off to help, while Rana offers birthing advice. It’s super exciting as Nick finally finds out what’s going on and rushes to the flats to find an ambulance arriving and a new life beginning... The Platts wet the baby's head at the Bistro (Photo: ITV) \nIf you think that’s enough drama for one week for Leanne, you’re very much mistaken. There are some great twists and turns at one of the most awkward parties the Bistro has ever held. As the Platts gather at the restaurant to celebrate the birth, the real father, Steve, is having second thoughts about letting Nick bring up his child. Tired & emotional Welcome to the world, baby Oliver (Photo: ITV) \nJane Danson tells us about the challenges of playing Leanne giving birth, and how she’s looking forward to even more explosive scenes to come... \nWhat was giving birth like to film? \nI’ve never acted that before, although I’ve done it twice in real life. It was weirdly exhausting. \nIs she worried about the real dad’s name coming out? \nSteve had said he didn’t want anything to do with his child, so she wasn’t at all worried. But then Michelle lost her baby and that changed everything. \nLeanne chooses the name Oliver. Why? \nShe likes it, it’s very traditional and classic. \nNow Oliver has arrived, can Leanne deal with the reality of bringing him up so close to Steve? \nShe knows she has to. Leaving is not an option and she can only hope he will keep his side of the deal. She’s also bringing up Simon round the corner from Peter – it’s like an episode of Jeremy Kyle. \nHow is Leanne feeling as the Bistro party kicks off? \nIncredibly tired. Leanne can think of nothing worse and would rather put her feet up in the flat. \nWhat would your advice to Leanne be? \nI think she should have come clean a lot sooner. But being a mum first and foremost is what will drive her. \nAre you looking forward to how the storyline pans out? \nYes, it goes off on so many different tangents, everybody has a part to play in it. I’ve never been able to second guess where it’s going to go. I enjoy getting my scripts! Party pain for 'Chelle Michelle with Leanne and Oliver (Photo: ITV) \nIt’s an emotional time for Steve and Michelle when they go to the seaside to scatter Ruairi’s ashes. \nLater, Michelle wants to be strong and insists they visit Leanne to welcome her new baby, Oliver. As the real father, Steve feels very uncomfortable and waits outside. \nHowever, when the couple go for dinner at the Bistro, they bump into the Platts celebrating the birth. Michelle congratulates Leanne but, as she and Steve harbour grief and secrets, it all gets too much for them. Emotions spill over, and this is one party that doesn’t end on a high... Will grope pic get Jenny a bum deal? Jenny has dirt on Richard (Photo: ITV) \nJenny might be more respectable these days, but she’s still got a devious side. \nWhen it looks like Richard Drake’s order for her specialised bras is going to be withdrawn, she takes drastic measures. She finds photographs of Drake with his hand on his PA’s bottom and prints them off. Could she be about to enter the world of blackmail? \nElsewhere, Bethany is in the grubby grasp of Nathan. When Sarah finds out they spent the night together, she bans her daughter from seeing the older man. But he gives Bethany a mobile so he can call her in secret.
