(get it?)\nA mind-blowing concept for the world's longest building has been revealed in the form of an incredibly cool, U-shaped skyscraper, and excuse us because we need a minute to take this all in. ðŸ˜³\n\"The Big Bend\" â€“ an architectural structure designed by Oiio studio â€“ is essentially an arched skyscraper that features a special elevator system able to travel horizontally, in curves and in loops.\nYou know, no biggie.\nSEE ALSO: Dubai is bringing the world its first rotating skyscraper\nAccording to Oiio's website , the design plans to brilliantly work around the New York City zoning laws that create several obstacles for developers, limiting their ability to maximize property height, by focusing on length rather than height.\n\"The Big Bend\" skyscraper concept imagined in New York.\nImage: oiio\n\"What if we substituted height with length? What if our buildings were long instead of tall?\" designers at Oiio thought. \"If we manage to bend our structure instead of bending the zoning rules of New York we would be able to create one of the most prestigious buildings in Manhattan. The longest building in the world.\"\n\"The Big Bend\" concept.\nImage: oiio\n\"The Big Bend\" compared to tallest buildings in the world.\nImage: oiio\nThe project's concept drawings show a unique structure in the form of a slender, glass-lined building that begins and ends on solid ground. At 4000 ft. in length, if the structure were to be built at its ideal location, 57th Street in Manhattan, it would easily trump the Burj Khalifa â€” a skyscraper in Dubai that holds the title of tallest (and longest) building in the world, at 2,722 ft.\nConcept drawing of a man in \"The Big Bend.\"\nImage: oiio\nNow go forth and imagine this epic concept for yourself.\nWATCH: Robotic glove lets people with limited hand mobility perform daily tasks", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tOgz-YkWtlGRNY5dB9yHA-8TX48=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425644%2F6e51d6db-373c-4c7b-98ec-28c20b6dc67a.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/9ycX7dJz.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4Yfpvj9ZeHfp9cZ26g11FkW4hPo=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425663%2F514c3613-1687-4084-96ce-d147ff719ae4.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZREN590-8JA8D8fdRQuogVSGnes=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425657%2F5796310f-3f1a-44d9-a0e8-afe30733306d.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/9ycX7dJz.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cwreTET80bsQghwnUoTt3_z_pxY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425646%2F736fad4c-d305-4c33-9111-ae59a1ec1485.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/t8uCIKUpJR2zIrGer8m6LY83me0=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425663%2F514c3613-1687-4084-96ce-d147ff719ae4.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jdRODf1BKe9Gr6rMyz55IeQsvRY=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425646%2F736fad4c-d305-4c33-9111-ae59a1ec1485.jpg", "http://www.oiiostudio.com/#/thebigbend/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gqFjyunNrvKjTXtnAmD19l0AWM0=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425644%2F6e51d6db-373c-4c7b-98ec-28c20b6dc67a.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/p3kDQn6NEmr6C_f2b3tLvcJkBXk=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425657%2F5796310f-3f1a-44d9-a0e8-afe30733306d.jpg", "http://www.oiiostudio.com/"], "published": "2017-03-25T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:40:25.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
