The questions ran a variety of topics, with one of the more interesting ones being about Brie's upcoming birth. \nWhen a fan showed appreciation for getting to see the ultrasound of her upcoming child, they asked if the birth would be documented similarly. \nBrie confirmed that not only will she film herself giving birth but will, in fact, film it for Total Bellas ! Her response is below: \n\"I actually am gonna film the birth. I'm going to film it for Total Bellas . We start filming Total Bellas again at the end of February and we will go all the way up to my birth, April 30. As of now, fingers crossed, I'm going to have a natural birth, so you can hear me scream and make funny faces and probably curse out my husband. But, yes, on Total Bellas you will see my birth.\" \nPretty interesting how much of her life the star is willing to film to share with her fans, but it sounds like an episode that viewers won't want to miss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:12:38.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
