For the first time in decades, America's oldest allies are questioning where Washington's heart is. \"The world is in trouble -- but we're going to straighten it out, ok? That's what I do,\" Trump said to an audience of religious and political leaders at the National Prayer Breakfast. Although the deadline for many U of T programs was Jan. 13, U of T will keep applications open for a while. While there’s no hard new deadline, programs are filling up.\nU of T has already seen an 82 per cent increase in applications from the United States, with 1,425 undergraduate applicants compared with 784 last year. They’ve also had an uptick in web traffic from Iran, one of the seven countries affected by the ban.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, more than 100,000 visas have been revoked since Trump restricted travel from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen last Friday. The State Department says fewer than 60,000 were cancelled.\nU of T doesn’t normally take stands or do anything to make a bit of a statement, so it’s actually very comforting to see them doing something like this\nThose contradicting numbers are the latest example of the widespread confusion within the U.S. government, with many senior officials complaining they weren’t consulted before the order was issued.\nOn a much smaller scale, U of T’s decision to accept students affected by the ban has also resulted in bureaucratic confusion. Unlike the University of Ottawa , Memorial University and the University of British Columbia , which publicly announced plans to help students affected earlier this week, U of T sent out a memo to staff only after being contacted by the National Post.\nThat memo tells staff U of T is helping through “consideration of late applications for admissions,” but provides little detail on how late applicants are being considered. As of Friday afternoon the web page for international graduate student applicants contains a notice on its front page about the extension. The front page for undergraduate international applicants does not.\nJasmine Denike, University of Toronto Students’ Union president, said she was “shocked” and had no idea U of T was planning to extend the deadline when asked for comment by the National Post.\nCole Burston/Bloomberg Demonstrators hold signs that read \"No One Is Illegal\" outside of the U.S. Consulate General during a protest in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on Monday, Jan. 30, 2017. “U of T doesn’t normally take stands or do anything to make a bit of a statement, so it’s actually very comforting to see them doing something like this,” she said.\nU of T’s law school put out a news release on Tuesday saying they were extending the deadline for their admissions and encouraging students from countries affected by the ban to contact the admissions office if they want to make a late application or transfer from another school.\n“I have received some exploratory emails from students who have already started law school in the U.S. about possibly transferring back,” said professor Ben Alarie, who oversees admissions for the law school.\nRelated ‘Own your pointless cruelty’: Samantha Bee calls out Trump’s ‘immoral and inhuman not-a-Muslim ban’ ‘They have killed my dream’: Immigration ban sows panic and confusion at airports around the globe Donald Trump fires acting attorney general for issuing order against immigration ban U of T is modelling their attempts after the law school. Welsh encouraged international undergraduate students to contact the university’s general admissions office, and graduate students to contact the school of graduate studies for application information.\nSeveral Canadian universities are going farther than U of T when it comes to helping late applicants. Memorial University and the University of Calgary are waiving application fees for those affected by the ban. U of T is waiving the fee for some graduate students, but not for undergraduates.\nAccording to U of T’s media relations director Althea Blackburn-Evans, individual Ontario universities can’t waive the fee because students apply through a province-wide system. That isn’t stopping the University of Ottawa from reducing costs—they’re going so far as to waive international tuition fees.\nU of T’s international student tuition fee has risen dramatically in recent years. An international student studying arts and science who starts in 2017 will pay $45,690. A student who started in 2015 paid $38,460.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:10:24.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
