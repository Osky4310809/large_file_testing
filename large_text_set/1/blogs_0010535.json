Set against a dramatic orchestral beat, the short clip shows the beloved Merc with a Mouth running through a list of the motion picture’s golden attributes such as \"42 rejection letters from Fox,\" \"seven magical unicorns\" and \"three good walls and a fourth that's broken,\" to name a few.\nSurprisingly, the film has already nabbed a slew of nominations such as best comedy and best musical, as well as best actor for Reynolds, at this past Golden Globes. Unfortunately, the second-highest-grossing “R”-rated movie ever created in the United States lost to La La Land , which stars Ryan Gosling.\nWatch the ridiculous promotional campaign below and let us know if you think Deadpool deserves to win Best Picture at the upcoming Oscars this February 26.\npic.twitter.com/TNorErkZXf \n— Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) January 13, 2017 \n\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:51:15.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
