Bathing in a pancake bath, of course, which is a real thing visitors to Japan’s Kanagawa Prefecture. In celebration of the country’s beloved Morinaga hot cake mix, there are special pancake baths springing up all over a resort there for a short time. Yes, you can actually take a “hot cake bath,” or hot keeki ofuro, as it’s called in Japanese. Sounds like a tasty way to get clean.\n森永ホットケーキ風呂が今日からスタート٩(๑❛ᴗ❛๑)۶！\nあま〜い香りに癒されてみて🥞 #ホットケーキ #水着 pic.twitter.com/YEBOCOqFfr\n— 箱根小涌園ユネッサン (@boxhappy_yns) March 3, 2017\nBut before you get too excited, there’s no pancake mix in the baths or anything. They do smell like maple syrup and vanilla, and the water’s brown. That’s because real maple syrup is added to the baths three times a day. It sounds like it might get a little sticky, which might be a concern if you’re sitting in the bath to get clean, but as is the custom for group baths like these most customers will have taken a shower before getting in. Perhaps this is a special maple syrup that doesn’t have any stickiness of note to worry about.\nThis isn’t the first time this particular resort has been home to some awesome-sounding ways to relax. The Hakone Kowakien Yunessun resort also includes an amazake, coffee bath and red wine bath for anyone who takes those drinks seriously. And who wouldn’t? Those are some super fun-sounding baths to take a dip in.\nIf you’re in the neighborhood for some reason from now until April 25, you should be able to head on down to the resort and hop in the pancake bath of your dreams. But hurry, because it’s only a limited time kind of event. And it’ll likely be full of others who want to realize their very important dreams of becoming pancake bath people too, so get a move on! Just don’t try to drink the water, okay?", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E6%B0%B4%E7%9D%80?src=hash", "https://t.co/YEBOCOqFfr", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%9B%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AD?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/boxhappy_yns/status/837460507711852544"], "published": "2017-03-21T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:48:57.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
