They didn’t have to because they weren’t cropped-haired wide-bottomed girls. They were pretty girls , godly women, they didn’t take the bait.” \n“If your daughters are good athletes,” Daubenmire warned parents, “you better cover them in prayer because the recruiting that goes on, the pressure that goes on to be ‘one of the girls’ is enormous .” \nThis is straight-up bigotry. Daubenmire believes the lie that people can be “recruited” into homosexuality — that they have to because “they can’t reproduce!”— and that lesbians all look a certain way. \nAnd then, somehow, he said something arguably worse. \nLater in the broadcast, Daubenmire began screaming that “two men laying in bed having sex, it ain’t equal with my wife and I and the covenant of marriage.” \n“That ain’t equal,” he declared, “because if two men having sex is equal, then soon it will be a man and a dog having sex. ” \nThis is what right-wing Christianity looks like these days: Lies on top of more lies on top of a mountain of bigotry — and that’s before we even get to the Jesus story. \nNo wonder people don’t trust them anymore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:11:58.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
