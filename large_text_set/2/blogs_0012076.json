No release date for the book has been announced. • Construction is currently underway at René Redzepi’s upcoming Noma pop-up in Tulum, Mexico, where the $600 per person reservations are already sold out . “There is no existing infrastructure at all, no plumbing electricity or water,” write Redzepi and chef Rosio Sanchez of the open-air space. “We are bringing all of that in.” The team has eight weeks to throw it all together: Noma Mexico debuts April 12. • Meanwhile, an ex-Noma chef is also cashing in on Tulum’s cool factor, launching his own pop-up in the resort destination: Mads Refslund, who intrepid New York City diners will know from the Nordic-inflected Acme, will be a chef in residence at Gitano Tulum starting today.

Sweet. • Worthy reading: If your morning drink is less espresso-based, more hair of the dog, Extra Crispy traces the origin of the clamato preparado , aka a bloody mary with clam juice.
