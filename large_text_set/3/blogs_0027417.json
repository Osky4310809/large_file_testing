Each of the previous ten were first round picks. Tatum is expected to be drafted in the lottery portion of the NBA draft. Which would make him the 8th Blue Devil freshman selected that high. Some project him as high as a top three pick. \n“I’m excited to take the next step in pursuing my lifelong dream of playing basketball at the highest possible level.” \nDuke has produced at least one first-round NBA Draft pick in each of the last six years. Mike Krzyzewski has coached 32 first-round picks, including a draft-record 21 lottery selections .
