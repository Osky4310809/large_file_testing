The appearance of the revised B-segment sedan in the South Asian nation means that it shouldn’t be long now before it goes on sale here, with the order books having already been opened . \nAs we’ve seen before, the front gets redesigned headlights with standard LED daytime running lights, joined together by a new chrome bar inspired by the new Civic; the grille also gains a new honeycomb mesh and a chrome strip. The front and rear bumpers have also been reprofiled, while the wheels get new two-tone designs. \nThe VX and new range-topping ZX models gain LED headlights, LED fog lights, and 16-inch alloys, while the ZX receives a new bootlid spoiler with an integrated LED brake light and LED tail lights. \nInside, there’s new LED cabin and map lighting, plus a new engine start button from the new Civic. The V, VX and ZX variants are also fitted with a new seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system called Digipad, which adds navigation, voice recognition, Bluetooth and MirrorLink connectivity, 1.5 GB worth of internal memory, a HDMI port and WiFi support. \nStandard equipment on the entry-level S includes steel wheels, fabric seats, a tilt-adjustable steering wheel and four speakers. The SV model brings mirror-mounted LED indicators, a multifunction steering wheel with telescopic adjustment, touch-operated automatic climate control, central locking, cruise control, power-folding door mirrors, a height-adjustable driver’s seat and front and rear armrests. \nStepping up to the V nets you alloy wheels, keyless entry, push button start, a reverse camera and eight speakers, while the VX adds an electric sunroof, leather upholstery and an auto-dimming rear-view mirror. The VX throws in adjustable rear headrests. \nAll models are available with a 1.5 litre i-VTEC petrol engine that delivers 119 PS at 6,600 rpm and 145 Nm of torque at 4,600 rpm – this mill is available with either a five-speed manual gearbox or a CVT with seven virtual ratios and paddle shifters. Fuel consumption is rated at 17.4 km per litre with the former and 18 km per litre with the stepless transmission. \nOffered as an option on all but the base S variant is a 1.5 litre i-DTEC diesel engine, producing 100 PS at 3,600 rpm and 200 Nm at 1,750 rpm. It’s mated only to a six-speed manual, producing a fuel consumption figure of 25.6 km per litre. A number of new sound and vibration absorption technologies have been applied on the oil-burning models to reduce noise, vibration and harshness. \nIn terms of safety, all models get dual airbags, ABS with EBD and ISOFIX rear child seat anchors, with six airbags now added on the ZX. There’s still no stability control, however.
