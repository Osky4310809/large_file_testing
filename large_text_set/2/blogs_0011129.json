Credit Barclay Fernandez/The Victoria Advocate, via Associated Press The number of extremist groups active in the United States rose for the second year in a row last year, propelled in part by the mainstreaming of far-right rhetoric by the Trump campaign, particularly on topics like immigration and Islam, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremism in the United States. The number of anti-Muslim groups grew the most, almost tripling to 101 in 2016 from 34 in 2015, in part because of President Trump’s 2015 proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States in response to the Syrian refugee crisis and terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla. There were a total of 917 hate groups operating in the United States in 2016, an increase from 892 in 2015 and 784 in 2014, the center said in its annual report . The number of organized anti-government groups, like armed militias, dropped by almost 40 percent, however, to 623 in 2016 from 998 in 2015. That decline was a consequence of the increasingly mainstream presence of policy ideas and conspiracy theories about Islam and immigrants that originated on the political fringe, researchers said. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the center, said Mr. Trump’s election had been “absolutely electrifying to the radical right.” “Trump has co-opted many of the issues of the radical right, and that has prevented or at least slowed the growth of these groups,” Mr. Potok said. He added, “The Trump phenomenon has really unleashed right-wing hate in this country in a way that is difficult to remember.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign with a series of divisive claims, including a June 2015 speech that referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals.” That December, he proposed fighting terrorism with a Muslim ban , a sharp departure from past presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who said jihadist groups did not represent all Muslims. Both as a candidate and as president, Mr. Trump has used Twitter and speeches to attack an ever-growing list of targets that number in the hundreds . He has sometimes posted images and messages of support on Twitter that appeared to be anti-Semitic or the work of white nationalists, as have his advisers. Nevertheless, Mr. Trump has consistently rejected the notion that his rhetoric or policy proposals have been divisive or extreme. He has often pointed out that his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are Orthodox Jews, and when asked about his support among white nationalist groups in an interview with The New York Times last November, he said, “I disavow and condemn” them.
