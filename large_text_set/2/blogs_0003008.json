It makes me happy. Those who want land here will get it,” the regional governor said. \nAbout 28 percent of Russians interested in the program say they want to use the land to build a home. About 17 percent want to use the land for agriculture or raise cattle. Another seven percent say they will use the land to build hotels and develop local tourism. \nThe land can be used for any lawful purpose, and the new owners cannot rent, sell, or give it away for five years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T17:46:13.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
