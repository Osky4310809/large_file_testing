He commented on a newspaper article about the Christian phrase’s addition and gave away the real motive : \nThank you Henderson County Board of Commissioners and Rick Lanier! Our nation was founded on our firm belief in God. The preamble to our very own state’s constitution reads “We, the people of the State of North Carolina, grateful to Almighty God, the Sovereign Ruler of Nations, for the preservation of the American Union…” For far too long Christians have remained quiet while non-believers have slowly eroded our values and the decay of the family unit. It is high time that our leaders step up and help us return to the values that built this great country. \nThat’s a long-winded way of giving Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and atheists the middle finger. And it’s absurd that anyone would think the problem with Christians is that they’re too quiet , as if they have no political power. Maybe if they’re lucky, a Christian will one day get elected to Congress. Or maybe even get to the White House! \nJust because Edwards is ignorant, though, doesn’t mean these words are coming down. Church/state separation groups have not been successful at fighting this particular battle because the Christians who approve the words tend to stick to the script about how it’s all about the motto rather than their faith. \nGood thing their God doesn’t have a problem with lying. \n(Image via Facebook .
