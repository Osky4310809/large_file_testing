Others are less so, such as a reluctance to use full stops and commas.\nCornell and Stanford University researchers found that they could spot trolls with around 80 per cent accuracy simply from looking at the language they used.\nThe team studied comments on three sites – CNN, right-wing news site Breitbart and gaming site IGN – and looked for patterns.\nTrolls aren’t keen on full stops or capitals \n\nGenerally speaking, trolls tend to shun punctuation, swear more and make comments which are less readable, the researchers found.\nTrolls tend to bang on and on about the same topic \n\nThe researchers found that users who went on to be banned tended to restrict themselves to a few comment threads, and on provoking people into responding to them there.\nTrolls tend to sound a bit different from everyone else \n\nTrolls use slightly different language from other users – they tend not to fit exactly into the technical jargon of sites such as IGN, and use more negative words.\nTrolls will not let it drop \n(Picture: Getty) One of the most reliable ways to spot trolls is that they keep posting replies once they’ve got someone interested.\nUsers who went on to be banned tended to post repeatedly in the same comments threat, replying again and again.\nTrolls don’t care if posts are deleted \n\nIf you’re wondering whether someone is a troll, have a look at their comment history.\nMany sites are slow to block trolls – and trolls tend to have dozens of comments deleted before they are finally blocked.\nIf you are dealing with someone a bit troll-ish, it’s a good way to spot them.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T09:33:18.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
