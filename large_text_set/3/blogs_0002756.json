Obese Nicole Lewis weighs in at almost 700lbs (Photo: Xposure) \nNicole - who is shown in the episode being hosed down outside instead of showering - reveals: \"When I was little, me and my mom never really got along, because she had a really bad temper, and would explode on me for things that I just didn’t understand. \n\"And when that happened, I would always run to the garage, because my dad would be out there working on something. So I would just sit with him, and he would give me a snack. She has to be hosed down outside (Photo: Xposure) She blamed her upbringing for her weight gain (Photo: Xposure) \n\"And that was safety. I never wanted to leave his side, but my dad was a truck driver, so he was on the road a lot. And when he wasn’t there, all I had to run to was food.\" \nShe admits that the drug use made things very difficult and tense at home, especially when they ran out of cocaine. \nNow Nicole, from Marion, Ohio, loves making the trip to the supermarket with partner Charlie, even though she is too overweight to fit in the mobility scooters provided by the store . Shopping trips are the only time the couple get to spend together (Photo: TLC) Nicole says junk food shopping with her boyfriend is romantic (Photo: TLC) She loves to see the selection of junk food on offer (Photo: TLC) \nThis mean she has to be pushed around in a wheelchair by Charlie, which means it's even more difficult to get around the shop . \nBut Nicole's weight doesn't just have an impact on her shopping habits - her morbid obesity means she is too big to take care of her two toddlers. \nThis has prompted her to move to Houston, Texas to see Dr. Younan Nowzaradan as she tried to get weight loss surgery - and she even dropped 163lbs over six months. \n* Nicole and her battle to lose weight is currently featured on TLC's show My 600lb Life , aired on Wednesday nights.
