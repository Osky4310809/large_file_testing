We’ve blurred out the bad language, but in the note, the person threatens to key the other driver’s car and slash their tires. The threatening note (Image credit City of Boston) \n“This is your first warning,” the note reads. “DO NOT —- WITH ME.” \nSpace savers are only allowed for 48 hours in most parts of the city when Boston declares a snow emergency, which wasn’t the case last weekend. Space savers are prohibited in the South End. \n“The City will not tolerate any violent acts or destruction of property and encourages residents to contact the BPD if these incidents occur,” a spokeswoman for Mayor Marty Walsh said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:21:12.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
