I think most people involved [in the deal] didn’t truly believe they would be there long.”\nAt this point, the Islanders are most interested in returning to Long Island. The Post has previously reported the team’s new owners, Jonathan Ledecky and Scott Malkin, considered Belmont Park and Queens to be potential options.

Islanders, Barclays eye escape clause to get team out of Brooklyn Governor Andrew Cuomo favors an arena at Belmont Park, a source close to the situation said, which is why the state in recent months rejected all proposals for the undeveloped site, including from those wanting to build retail stores, as well as the Cosmos ownership who wanted to build a soccer stadium.\nThe Dolans, who own the Knicks and MSG, would be involved in supporting the project, the source said, perhaps helping to book non-sports entertainment.\nLast week, Queens Borough President Melinda Katz said she’d like to see the Willets Point site used for a hockey arena or soccer stadium, but never mentioned the Islanders by name.\nFans have been unhappy with the move since the beginning, as the team left its Nassau County fan base for a building not designed for hockey.\nAverage attendance this season is just 12,828, third-lowest in the league and there are a considerable amount of obstructed-view seats. To make matters worse, the ice surface has been consistently criticized — including by the Islanders’ own players — in part because the ice system is made of plastic pipes.

Would one person support this Isles' arena pipe dream? “The owners are committed to the franchise, they’re committed to New York and the great fan base that has followed the Islanders,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said at the All-Star Game in Los Angeles over the weekend. “There are some issues about playing at Barclays. It may be fundamental to the ice system. That’s not something that can be fixed in the short term.’’\nThe Islanders played at Nassau Coliseum for over four decades before moving out of the antiquated building.\nCharles Wang, who owned the Isles at the time, signed a 25-year lease with Barclays Center in 2012 that includes an out clause that can be triggered after the fourth season.\nAnd although the Coliseum is scheduled to reopen in April after a $130 million renovation, it’s projected to have about 13,000 seats for hockey, making it too small to permanently house an NHL team.\nUnder the current lease, the Islanders gave up control of the business side of operations because they were running at a deficit. Barclays Center agreed to pay the Islanders an average lump sum of $53.5 million annually with the arena making its money off ticket and suite sales, sponsorships and other promotions, sources said.\nA Barclays spokesman declined comment\n— Additional reporting by Josh Kosman", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:05:43.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
