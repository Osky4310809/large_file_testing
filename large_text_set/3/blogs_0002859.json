And while there might still be some time before newly-announced smartphones like the LG G6 ( first impressions ) board their flight to India, there are others which are already ready to try their luck in the Indian marketplace. Here’s a look at some of the top smartphones expected to launch in India in March. Let’s get started. Moto G5 and G5 Plus \nAfter unveiling the Moto G5 duo at MWC, Lenovo has sent out invites for a press event in India scheduled on March 15th, where it is expected to launch the devices in India. Both the G5 and G5   flaunt metal unibody designs with water repellent nano-coatings. They come with fingerprint scanners embedded in the front home buttons, while the support for fast charging is also a welcome addition. The Moto G5 comes with a 5-inch full HD display, a Snapdragon 430 SoC and 2GB of RAM. On the other hand, the G5 Plus gets a larger 5.2-inch full HD canvas and upgraded specs like a Snapdragon 625 processor and 3GB of RAM. Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) \nSamsung has just confirmed it would be bringing the Galaxy A5 2017 ( first impressions ) to India. The smartphone looks like a decent mid-ranger with its specifications including an octa-core Exynos processor, 3GB of RAM and 16MP cameras on both the front and the rear. The smartphone flaunts a 5.2-inch full HD Super AMOLED canvas and comes with extra goodies like IP68 dust and water resistance, a fingerprint scanner and dual SIM support. The Galaxy A5 (2017) is fuelled by a 3,000mAh non-removable battery with fast charging support, and had been priced at Rs 28,490. It will go on sale on March 15th. Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) \nIt’s not just the Galaxy A5 that Samsung is launching in March. The Korean giant will also bring the 2017 version of the Galaxy A7 that bears a large 5.7-inch full HD Super AMOLED display. Much like its smaller sibling, the Galaxy A7 (2017) also comes with features like a fingerprint scanner, IP68 dust and water resistance and dual SIM support. But with a larger form factor, the smartphone crams in a bigger 3,600mAh non-removable battery. The optics department will be taken care of by the same 16MP cameras that are on board the Galaxy A5 (2017). Priced at Rs 33,490, it will also be available starting March 15th. Xiaomi Redmi 4A \nAfter the success of the Redmi 3S and Redmi 3S Prime ( review ), Xiaomi is rumoured to bring another entry-level Android smartphone to India, this time the Xiaomi Redmi 4A . The compact phone comes with a 5-inch 720p display and is powered by a Snapdragon 425 SoC with 2GB of RAM. All this draws power from a 3,120mAh battery, which isn’t user-replaceable, thanks to the metal unibody design of the Redmi 4A. For photography, the phone comes with a 13MP / 5MP camera combo on the rear and front respectively. Connectivity options include dual-SIM support, 4G LTE, as well as VoLTE. nubia N1 Lite \nAnother budget device that caught our attention is the nubia N1 Lite . The phone is expected to launch in India this month and comes with a 5.5-inch HD IPS LCD display. Under the hood, it’s powered by a quad-core MediaTek MT6737 SoC, aided by 2GB of RAM and a 3,000mAh non-removable battery. The dual-SIM capable smartphone comes with a fingerprint scanner and is host to an 8MP / 5MP camera combo on the rear and front respectively. nubia Z11 miniS \nAnother handset from nubia that is expected to launch in India pretty soon is the Z11 miniS . For the uninitiated, the device comes with a 5.2-inch full HD IPS LCD panel, surrounded by a metal unibody design that looks pleasing to the eye. At the heart of the Z11 miniS resides a Snapdragon 625 SoC, coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. The inclusion of a fingerprint scanner and NFC support are welcome additions. For the optics, the phone utilises a 23MP camera at the back, along with a 13MP front camera for the selfies.
