File photo MANILA, Philippines ( Philippine News Agency ) -- The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority has temporarily suspended the issuance of exemptions under the Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program or the number coding scheme as it reviews its policies. MMDA General Manager Thomas Orbos said that the agency has been deluged with applications for the number coding exemptions. “The volume of vehicles is there but we have to revisit the policies on the exemptions under the UVVRP because this might defeat the purpose of reducing the number of cars on the roads,” Orbos said. He reiterated that the issuance of an exemption from the UVVRP is subject to evaluation and in consideration of exceptional humanitarian reasons. The MMDA memorandum circular allows for automatic exemption without the need for an MMDA exemption certificate under certain circumstances, such as vehicles carrying person needing immediate medical attention, official and marked media vehicles. Under the UVVRP, vehicles with license plates ending in 1 and 2 are prohibited on major thoroughfares in Metro Manila every Monday; 3 and 4 every Tuesday; 5 and 6 every Wednesday; 7 and 8 every Thursday; and 9 and 0 every Friday. The number coding scheme is lifted during Saturday, Sunday, and regular holidays. A recent resolution from the Metro Manila Council, MMDA’s policy-making body, has suspended the 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. window hours until January 31. The same resolution also expanded the UVVRP coverage to all radial and circumferential roads in the metropolis.
