Wait until you hear their nicknames for each other Just when we didn’t think it was humanly possibly, bam ! Zayn Malik just set the #boyfriendgoals even higher by revealing the super cute nicknames he and his supermodel girlfriend Gigi Hadid use for each other. The nicknames aren’t too gushy, and they’re not too plain-Jane. Nope, they’re ~just~ right for these two lovebirds .\nAnd the nicknames are ( drumroll, please )… Zee and Gee. “Zigi” conjointly, although we admit that we already knew that one.\n“I call her Gee, she calls me Zee. There are some other nicknames too, but I’ll keep those private,” the 24-year-old heartthrob told The Sunday Times .\nPhoto by Darren Gerrish/WireImage Private nicknames, you say? Tell us more, Zayn!\nAll kidding aside, Gigi and Zayn aren’t the first ultra-adorable celebrity couple to reveal their nicknames for each other. Apparently, Cameron Diaz calls hubby Benji Madden by the name of “Buh.” And once upon a time when Selena Gomez and Orlando Bloom were an item , she called her hunky former beau “Orly.”\nWhile it would seem obvious that celebrity couples would have nicknames for each other — and then share those nicknames with us — it seems that star-powered duos are more commonly known for their joint, media-dubbed nicknames. You know the classics (although many of these couples are no longer together): Brangelina, Bennifer, TomKat, Hiddleswift, Kimye; the list goes on and on!\neveryday \nA post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Feb 14, 2017 at 6:31pm PST \nBut, we must admit, we like the more personalized couple names celeb significant others give each other, versus the hybrid monikers. Still, that doesn’t mean we’re not totally #TeamZiGiForLife.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:44:09.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
