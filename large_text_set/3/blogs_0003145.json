Dynamo beat MLS champion Sounders FC Dallas grabbed the first away win of the 2017 MLS season, downing the star-studded LA Galaxy 2-1. \nKellyn Acosta scored in the 69th minute and FC Dallas beat the LA Galaxy 2-1 to open their Major League Soccer season on Saturday. \nDefending MLS Supporters' Shield champion Dallas spoiled the debut of Galaxy coach Curt Onalfo, who replaced new U.S. national team coach Bruce Arena. \nFC Dallas, which hadn't won a league game at LA since 2009, squandered an opportunity in the 33rd minute. Dave Romney deflected a headed shot, and the ball went right to Michael Barrios, who then took a shot past LA goalkeeper Brian Rowe, but Jelle Van Damme cleared Barrios' point-blank shot off the line. \nDallas' Maximiliano Urruti scored the opening goal in the 47th minute, splitting two defenders and firing his shot from outside the 18-yard box and into the back of the net. \nThe Galaxy's Giovani dos Santos scored from a penalty kick in the 57th minute to make it 1-1, but Acosta restored Dallas' lead by beating two defenders and shooting into the bottom corner at the near post. After being sidelined with a serious heart condition, Clint Dempsey returned to the field, and had an immediate impact. \nClint Dempsey scored in his first competitive game since August but Seattle Sounders lost their opener 2-1 to the Houston Dynamo . \nDempsey had to miss the second half of the season and the Sounders' run to the MLS Cup after the discovery of an irregular heartbeat. But he's been building up his fitness in preseason and returned to score from a left-footed shot in the 58th minute. \nBut by that time, the Dynamo had already taken a 2-0 lead through an Erick Torres free kick and Romell Quioto's debut goal. \nSounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei guessed to his right but Torres' free kick went to his left for the opening goal in the 20th minute. \nQuioto, whom Houston acquired from Olimpia in December, then curled a long shot over Frei's hands in the 42nd minute. The Colorado Rapid's started where they ended last season, with a win at home, stymieing the Revolution all night. \nDominique Badji scored, Zac McMath made three saves and the Colorado Rapids beat the New England Revolution 1-0. \nBadji drew a foul on Benjamin Angoua, setting up a free kick by Dillon Powers near the right corner. Kevin Doyle's header bounced off the far post before Jared Watts and goalkeeper Cody Copper converged on the ball, sending it high in the air and Badji's header from inside the six-yard box found the back of the net in the 52nd minute. \nMcMath had six shutouts in 16 starts before Tim Howard -- who spent 13 seasons in the English Premier League and has 111 appearances for the U.S. national team -- joined the Rapids last season. Howard is still recovering from offseason surgery to repair a groin injury. \nShkelzen Gashi, who led Colorado with nine goals last season, missed the game because of inflammation in his Achilles. Columbus' home-opener started wonderfully thanks to Ethan Finlay, only for Chicago to tie in the second-half for a point apiece. \nDavid Accam scored late in the second half to help the Chicago Fire salvage a 1-1 draw with Columbus Crew SC . \nColumbus, trying to rebound from missing the playoffs a year after reaching the championship game, took the lead in the 17th minute when Ethan Finlay headed in a long cross from Justin Meram. \nBut the Fire hit back in the 73rd minute when Dax McCarty intercepted a pass at midfield and quickly put the ball forward to John Gossens, who slotted it ahead to Accam. \nAccam dribbled into the box, where he turned around a Crew defender before rolling a shot into the far right corner. Last year's MLS Cup runner-up Toronto FC were unable to find any magic in their season opener, drawing 0-0 with RSL. \nNick Rimando saved a penalty from Sebastian Giovinco to help Real Salt Lake secure a goalless draw against defending Eastern Conference champion Toronto FC . \nRimando conceded the penalty after the half-hour mark by tripping up Giovinco, who sent a low kick from the spot well within the goalkeeper's grasp. \nIn the second half, Jozy Altidore got by two defenders and passed to Giovinco in the center of the box, but Rimando again blocked his right-footed shot. \nRSL came close to finding a winner with 10 minutes left, but Joao Plata could not keep his shot on target after being played in by Kyle Beckerman's chipped pass. Tim Melia's early PK stop set the tone for the night, as chances proved scarce in this scoreless draw for D.C. and SKC. \nSporting Kansas City goalkeeper Tim Melia stopped a penalty as well as a follow-up attempt to help his team earn a point in a goalless draw at D.C. United . \nMelia, who had five saves on the night, dove to his right to block Marcelo Sarvas' penalty in the 17th minute, then got up to save Patrick Mullins' shot from the rebound. \nSKC put United under pressure early and often, but goalkeeper Bill Hamid stood tall. \nAfter Dom Dwyer's headed shot from close range sailed over the crossbar in the ninth minute, Hamid jumped to punch away Benny Feihaber's free kick over the crossbar five minutes later. \nThen in the 78th minute, Dwyer spun a defender in midfield and fired a shot that Hamid knocked away. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T06:23:52.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
