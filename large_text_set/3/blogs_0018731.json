Artem Tashkinov writes: In a move that will shock a lot of people, someone at Microsoft decided to deny Windows 7/8.1 updates to the users of the following CPU architectures: Intel seventh (7th)-generation processors (Kaby Lake); AMD \"Bristol Ridge\" (Zen/Ryzen); Qualcomm \"8996.\" It's impossible to find any justification for this decision to halt support for the x86 architectures listed above because you can perfectly run MS-DOS on them. Perhaps, Microsoft has decided that the process of foisting Windows 10 isn't running at full steam, so the company created this purely artificial limitation. I expect it to be cancelled soon after a wide backlash from corporate customers. KitGuru notes that users may encounter the following error message when they attempt to update their OS: \"Your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows.\" The only resolution is to upgrade to Windows 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:58:00.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
