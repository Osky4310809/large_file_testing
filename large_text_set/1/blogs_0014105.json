He left the campaign because it was discovered he had a contract, that he’d been involved with the Ukraine.” \nWaters added she thinks “we have to drill down more and find out exactly what he or I think it is Flynn, what his role has been.” \n“Flynn has been connected to this false and scandalous news that they put out about people, that they put out about Hillary Clinton,” she explained. “They’ve discovered he’s made telephone calls to the Russian ambassador.” \n“It’s a lot to be investigated. We need to go further.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T19:01:33.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
