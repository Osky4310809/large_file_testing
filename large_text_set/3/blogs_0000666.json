(Provided by High Point Creamery) \nBen & Jerry’s introduced us to the politics of ice cream (think 2009’s “Yes Pecan!” as a buttery, nutty ode to Barack Obama’s campaign slogan and last year’s “Empower-Mint,” with partial proceeds going to the NAACP). \nNow, our own High Point Creamery is continuing the tradition with its new sorbet, “I’m Peach Mint.” \nChef-owner Erika Thomas just launched High Point’s spring flavor menu, but the innocently-named “Put the Lime in the Coconut Milk” (like Key Lime Pie, but in non-dairy ice cream form) and “Strawberry Rhubarb Crisp” (rhubarb syrup and oatmeal streusel swirled into a roasted strawberry ice cream base) aren’t raising eyebrows quite as much as “I’m Peach Mint.” \nWhatever could she be referring to? \n“We’re happy to support the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network in these turbulent economic times,” Thomas told us. (Ten percent of “I’m Peach Mint’s” pint sales will be donated to the group.) “After all, one in four restaurant workers are immigrants, and the immigrant population is the backbone of the supply chain that brings us fresh and delicious food.” \nAll of the new spring flavors, controversial or not, are now available at both High Point locations and as a part of the creamery’s genius ice cream flights. \nHigh Point Creamery – 215 S.
