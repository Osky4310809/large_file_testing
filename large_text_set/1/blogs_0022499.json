Patrick Ryan , USA TODAY Published 11:49 a.m. ET Jan. 26, 2017 | Updated 2 hours ago The myth around flapper icon Zelda Fitzgerald (Christina Ricci) is dispelled in Amazon's 'Z: The Beginning of Everything.' (Photo: Giovanni Rufino) 210 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNearly 70 years after her death, America's first flapper is more ubiquitous than ever. \nZelda Fitzgerald has long been a source of pop-culture fascination, inspiring both a song (The Eagles' Witchy Woman ) and a video game character ( The Legend of Zelda ), and cropping up in movies (Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris ) and TV shows (a Season 4 episode of Magnum, P.I. ). Last fall, news surfaced that Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett Johansson are attached to competing biopics being developed about the Jazz Age icon. Now, Amazon Prime is hopping on the Fitzgerald fixation with its new streaming series Z: The Beginning of Everything (out Friday). \nBased on Therese Anne Fowler's Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald , the 10-episode period drama stars Christina Ricci as the fashionable socialite and writer, tracing her modest beginnings in Montgomery, Ala., and whirlwind romance with novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. The first season culminates in Zelda's discovery that she's pregnant with her first and only child, Frances (aka \"Scottie\") — years before her marriage to Scott was mired by alcoholism, mutual infidelity and her struggles with mental illness. \nGoing into Z , \"I kind of knew the common misconception everyone has about her, that she was a crazy alcoholic woman who ruined F. Scott Fitzgerald’s life,\" Ricci says. \"To me, any time someone’s dismissed that way, it’s kind of, 'Oh, there must be something really interesting here.' ... For us, giving Zelda a first-person account felt like a bit of justice for her.\" \nThe tempestuous romance between Zelda (Christina Ricci) and 'The Great Gatsby' author F. Scott Fitzgerald (David Hoflin) is at the heart of Amazon's 'Z: Beginning of Everything.' (Photo: Nicole Rivelli) \nBefore Nancy Milford's definitive 1970 biography Zelda , the most telling window into her life was through her husband's novels: he featured aspects of her personality and their marriage into This Side of Paradise , The Beautiful and the Damned , The Great Gatsby and Tender is the Night — the latter was written around the time of Zelda's hospitalization in 1932 for schizophrenia. She died 12 years later at age 47 in a fire at a psychiatric hospital in Asheville, N.C., where she was being treated. \n\"We’re very attracted to this glam couple of the '20s, but the flip side of their story is this somber tale of a lot of misfortune,\" says R. Clifton Spargo, author of Beautiful Fools: The Last Affair of Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald . \"In the '30s, a lot of the adversity the Fitzgeralds face in their personal lives is some of what makes them ultimately admirable. There’s a way in which we treat her too reductively as the 'it' girl flapper, and then on the other side, the easily caricatured version of her and her mental breakdown.\" \nZelda poses with husband F. Scott Fitzgerald on a staircase in 1926. (Photo: Mondadori via Getty Images) \nPreparing for the role, Ricci found biographies such as Sally Kline's Zelda Fitzgerald: Her Voice in Paradise helpful in illuminating Zelda's glittering personality and devotion to motherhood. She believes we continue to be intrigued by Fitzgerald, who published only one novel (1932's Save Me the Waltz ), because she was a woman ahead of her time. \n\"Her mindset was much more like a modern woman’s,\" Ricci says. \"There's a negativeness that’s been perpetuated about her, and I think that’s because it took us so long to catch up to her thinking. Before, people were obsessed with her because her behavior and thinking was so mysterious to them and off-putting, because it wasn’t necessarily socially acceptable at that time. But now, I think we are where she was, and people relate to her.\" 210 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k7GFiE NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
