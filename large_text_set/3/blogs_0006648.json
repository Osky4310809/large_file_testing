Naturally, the result attracted many detractors who claim the brand faked the lap time by speeding up the footage or stitching different sector times together. \nHowever, Lamborghini has decided the best way to shut those critics up is with evidence, and has done so by providing Roadshow with the full Racelogic Vbox data recorded during the lap. As you can see, it shows the speed the car was travelling at during each second throughout the 6 minutes 52.01 seconds lap. \nLamborghini’s director of research and development Maurizio Reggiani also revealed that the car was running on Pirelli Trofeo R tyres during the lap, which aren’t standard on the car but can be specified as an option by customers. \nAs for the inconsistent speeds shown in the video, he said the speeds shown come from the GPS unit fitted to the car, which can occasionally give inconsistent results. If you’ve ever used a GPS system while driving, you’ll realise the speed displayed on the unit isn’t refreshed every millisecond, which is likely the case here. Do you think Lamborghini has done enough to silence the “haters?” \nGALLERY: Lamborghini Huracan Performante", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T14:16:14.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
