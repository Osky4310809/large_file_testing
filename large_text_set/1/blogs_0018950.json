Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA British dad-of-two has been told to \"go back to where he came from\" after an industrial brain injury left him speaking with a Polish accient. \nRobert Paling, 37, was left with brain damage after he was exposed to dangerous levels of carbon monoxide in a \"catastrophic\" accident. \nThis means he now suffers from foreign accent syndrome with broken speech and a Polish accent. \nRobert, from Hull, said: \"It's been very upsetting. Some people have told me to go back to where I come from.\" \nRobert, who worked as a joiner, was exposed to the deadly gas while working at a fish factory in Hull in October 2015, the Hull Daily Mail reported .

No risk assessment was carried out. \nThe judge involved in the case said the effects of the incident on Robert had been \"catastrophic\". \nAfter collapsing at home, Robert was hospitalised and diagnosed with serious brain damage which left him unable to carry out basic tasks like turning door handles, writing his name and speaking fluently. \nHe's been told he'll never work again. His anxiety makes him nervous around strangers, some of whom have even hurled racist abuse in his direction because of his accent. \nAlthough foreign accent syndrome can be temporary, Robert has been told he will probably speak the way he does now for the rest of his life.

If you asked me, 'do you want to work, or do you want to go to the pub to watch football?' I'd want to work. I've always loved doing what I did. \n\"That's the hardest thing. I can count on one hand the number of times I've been out by myself since it happened. \n\"But I take the dog for long walks and that's a big part of my therapy. It's been an adjustment for the whole family. \n\"My accent sounds Polish and other people say the same. When we're out and about people have been nasty. \n\"Some of them say 'go back to where you come from'. I try explaining I was born in Hull. But these people know me for a minute and then I never see them again.\" Robert was working at Roach Bros fish factory when the incident happened (Photo: Hull Daily Mail) \nFor Robert's partner of 18 years, Laura Parkin, the lifestyle changes have also been big. \nShe told how one well-meaning member of the public once gave the couple a Polish newspaper, with the best of intentions, because they heard Robert speaking. \n\"When people do get nasty it is upsetting and I want to go and explain to them,\" Laura said. \n\"But we have a great community down here. All our neighbours accept Robert for who he is. They give him time to speak. The lady in the shop even makes him count his change because she knows that's part of his therapy.\" \nBut it has hit his confidence and his personality hard. \nRecalling the moment he first realised he was speaking with a foreign accent, Robert said: \"At first I didn't know it was happening. Then you realise. After an hour, believe me it's not funny. \n\"Now I can accept it and I live with it. My sons joke with me about it.\" Read More Foreign accent syndrome: How Kay Russell went to bed with a headache - then woke up sounding French \nThe couple say that despite Westlands' guilty plea they have never received a personal apology from the company and the firm's director has never visited him since the incident. \nDespite this, and with Robert's cognitive state improving to the extent where he can now write his own signature and turn handles, they refuse to be downbeat. \n\"What happened in court is vindication to an extent,\" he said. \"I don't hold a grudge because it's not going to change what happened. \n\"I'm alive and I can still see my kids. I have a great family.\" \nLaura said: \"The doctors said if he'd been in the room for just a few minutes more he would have died. That's how close it was. \n\"We had two people close to us who died last year, so it puts into perspective for us.\" \nIn court, the company accepted responsibility what happened and asked for two years to pay any financial penalty, with the firm's solicitor telling District Judge Fred Rutherford that Westlands is \"in real financial difficulties with very limited assets\". Read More \n\"How long it is given to pay will make a real difference to its future,\" he said. \nBut Judge Rutherford rejected the application, giving them 12 months to pay instead. \nSumming up, he said: \"Had some sort of risk assessment been undertaken specifically with regard to carbon monoxide levels in the area then the petrol powered tool should not have been used or supplied. \n\"That carbon monoxide poisoning occurred is a case of that lack of risk assessment being carried out. \n\"The findings I have are that the company does and must accept that the levels of carbon monoxide poisoning had a catastrophic effect on this gentleman. \n\"Two years is far too long. It could be argued 12 months is far too long but I take into account, and the company has been open and frank about its accounts from the start.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T11:44:07.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
