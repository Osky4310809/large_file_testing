Kanye really uses hip-hop as a vehicle to display all of his talents, albeit some better than others.” \nAdditionally, McCune plans to use his course as a tool “to get students to connect issues of politics, race, gender, sexuality and culture.” \nAccording to the course syllabus, the 75 students currently enrolled in the course can expect to delve into topics that include, “I Love Kanye, or How Critique Slips Into Hate” and “Love Lock Down, or Hip-Hop’s Queer Love Languages.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T19:14:48.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
