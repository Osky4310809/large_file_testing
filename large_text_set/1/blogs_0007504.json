File photo \n  The P1 billion remitted to the national government by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) should have been used to feed the hungry instead of funding the rehabilitation of drug addicts, President Duterte said yesterday. \nIn a speech delivered during the oath taking of new appointees, Duterte said he would have killed all the drug addicts if the act were not prohibited by law. \n“Look at the irony of life. I released another P1 billion for these f*** drug addicts because of the community-based treatment or rehab there, whatever is going on there. They do not have money to buy medicine. So, just imagine, P1 billion which could have been used for something like feeding the hungry went to these fools,” the President said. \nPagcor chair Andrea Domingo handed Duterte the P5-billion check during a courtesy call in Malacañang last November. Part of the funds would be used to rehabilitate drug addicts and to provide free medicine to indigents. \n“I would have wanted to kill them all but it would cause a scandal. So I had to subsidize also (their treatment). They are Filipinos,” Duterte added. \nThe President, however, had a stern warning for those who would continue with their drug addiction.   \n“If this continues, then they have a good idea of how it evolved… if they continue to do drugs, then they are seeking their deaths,” he said in Filipino. \nDuterte also chided anew the human rights advocates who criticize his brutal war on illegal drugs. \n“Do you want the killings to stop immediately tomorrow? Go to them… just drop the shabu. Turn your back and walk away from the shabu industry, and tomorrow it will be heavenly peace,” he said.
