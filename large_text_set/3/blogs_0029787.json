Image copyright Roddy Riddle Image caption The race represented unfinished business for the former Commonwealth Games cyclist \n\"Families with children or other family members with Type 1 diabetes were following my progress and it was them I felt I let down. \n\"I wanted to prove that having Type 1 diabetes shouldn't stop you achieving your goals or achievements in life. \n\"By not finishing, I had let myself down, I had let my family down, my friends down and most importantly the whole diabetes community down.\" 'Whacky hallucinations' \nMr Riddle said he arrived at the start line for his second attempt much wiser and with more respect for the race. \nHe pulled a four-wheel pulk, a type of sledge carrying his supplies, instead of the two-wheel version that gave him back pain on the first attempt. \nMr Riddle said: \"I had also learned that I should sleep when I needed to sleep and eat when I needed to eat. It meant I didn't have the whacky hallucinations I had last year.\" \nHe added: \"I wasn't going back a third time. I was not coming home until I finished. Not finishing wasn't an option. \n\"But I was better prepared. Mentally I knew what I needed to do.\" Image copyright Ultra Arctic 6633 Image caption Mr Riddle said not finishing was not an option", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:50:33.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
