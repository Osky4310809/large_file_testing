There was that epic side-eye run-in at the Victoria’s Secret fashion show runway , followed by the ultimate revenge-body Instagram she posted just yesterday morning. Less than 24 hours later, and the supermodel was spotted in New York City with something new attached at her hip: a chain-wallet. \nThe good-taste-bad-taste accessory has been making a comeback thanks to brands like Vetements, and the supermodel is the latest to jump on the unexpected trend. It was a nice addition to her cropped pinstripe trousers which were also just the right length to show off her Tamara Mellon caged cutout booties.
