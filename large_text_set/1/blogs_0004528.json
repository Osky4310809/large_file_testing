We learned that Android 7.1 would be delayed for this phone due to some unspecified bugs the company needed to hammer out at the last minute, but we should expect to see the Nexus 6 receive the update during early January.\nTrue to their word, Google has finally released Android 7.1.1 Nougat to Nexus 6 owners. This update comes with the latest January security patches and can be grabbed as a full factory image or as an OTA update from the Google Developer webpage.\nFactory Image: N4F26I (7.1.1 with Jan. 2017 security patches) OTA Update: N6F26Q (7.1.1 with Jan. 2017 security patches) Remember, in order to install these updates, you will need to have the appropriate USB drivers for your device. Then, you will need to also grab the ADB and Fastboot binaries, depending on which installation method you chose. Once youâ€™re acquired all of that, then simply follow the instructions provided on the Factory Image page or OTA page to apply the update. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:56:55.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
