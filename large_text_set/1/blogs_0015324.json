Woman fined for tipping coffee down the gutter The Sun  07am \nA PENSIONER was slapped with a $130 (£80) littering fine for pouring a cup of coffee down the drain. \nSue Peckitt, 65, was astonished when two council snoopers told her it was illegal to tip a drink away in the street. \nRetired civil servant Sue said she did not like the taste of the takeaway coffee and poured the liquid down a drain because she want to make a litter bin wet. \nAs she went to bin the empty cup a pair of council wardens swooped and hit her with an on-the-spot fixed penalty notice for £80. \nThe fine’s paperwork alleges Sue “did drop leave and walk away from coffee diwn (sic) the drain” near Ealing Broadway shopping centre in West London. \nSue, of Hanwell, told local news site getwestlondon : “I am astonished by the whole process. \n“I had bought a cup of coffee, it wasn’t very nice and I thought, I want to get rid of this. \n“So I poured it down the drain and then I started to walk to the bin to put the cup in the bin. \n“The enforcement officers stopped me and said I was breaking the law, then I filled in all the forms and they fined me £80. \n“I think there is a big problem with litter but it is bizarre. \n“I had put this coffee down (the drain) because it was the safe and environmentally friendly thing to do. \n“The reason I didn’t dispose of the cup and the liquid in the bin was that I didn’t want to turn the contents of the bin into a soggy mess.” \nSue appealed against the fine — but Ealing council insisted she must pay up. \nHowever it changed its mind after being contacted by local reporters. \nA Town Hall spokesman said: “The council has investigated this particular case and will be dropping the fine originally issued. \n“Our priority is to make sure that the borough is clean and litter free and we apologise for any inconvenience that this may have caused.” media_camera Ealing Broadway is a busy area in West London. \nThis story first appeared on The Sun and was republished here with permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:21:33.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
