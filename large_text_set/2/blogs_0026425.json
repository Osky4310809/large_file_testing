The Turnbull government's push for taxpayers to finance new coal-fired power stations is facing its first test after an application for support was lodged with the national green bank. Aa Clean Energy Finance Corporation chief Oliver Yates told a Senate estimates hearing that the agency received an email on Friday requesting a loan for a proposed $1.2 billion, 900 megawatt coal plant with carbon capture and storage. It's not clear who is behind the plant, or where it could be located. The corporation is banned from financing capture and storage technology, which involves burying the greenhouse gas emitted in burning coal underground. Dropping the ban would require a challenging change in legislation – a step likely to be opposed by Labor and the Greens. Mr Yates said he believed new coal plants were not commercially viable unless the government was willing to indemnify the owner for the life of the plant. He said the indemnity would need to cover any future climate change policy - an unquantifiable sum covering decades - and potential delays in construction due to protests. Mr Yates, a former Macquarie Bank executive director who is stepping down as head of the finance corporation, said he was not aware of any bank that would be willing to lend to a project that may be unviable. \"I don't see that as a sensible risk position for the taxpayer to take,\" he said. \"If a private sector participant wants to go and build anything – they want to build a theme park, want to build the Eiffel Tower – it may not be economically sensible, but they are entitled to go and do it if they want to.\" It comes as the government is pushing the case for new coal power generation as baseload power to provide back-up to the growing amount of intermittent wind and solar generation in the national electricity grid, and attacking Labor for its uncosted goal of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030. Mr Yates said among the risks facing coal proposals was the falling cost of renewable energy. Coal generators would need to compete to sell the electricity they produced. An analysis by consultants Bloomberg New Energy Finance recently found new coal plants, with emissions up to 25 per cent lower than Australia's existing plants, would be more expensive than gas, wind or solar power. Adding carbon capture and storage would dramatically further increase the cost. Asked about the analysis, Mr Yates said financiers would always support the cheaper option, but pointed to other factors that needed to be considered including the cost of storage for renewable energy and, conversely, that coal plants were inflexible and needed to run even when not needed. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is effectively barred from lending for new coal plants. Guidelines set by the agency's board mean that it can only consider proposals with emissions 50 per cent lower than the national grid average of about 0.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour generated. Modern black and brown coal plants emit about 0.7 and 0.9 tonnes per megawatt hour respectively. Those guidelines could be changed if Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg or Finance Minister Mathias Cormann directed the board to change the definition. The corporation, which delivers taxpayers a return of about 6 per cent on investment, can not consider applications for nuclear or carbon capture and storage technology without a change in legislation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:15:27.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
