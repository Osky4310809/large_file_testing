I would like to feel that. Guardiola and Stones in training (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Stones makes a challenge against West Ham (Photo: AFP/Getty) \n\"But I'm not concerned about what Everton fans decide to do. Hopefully they can respect him because I know how John respects the club because they helped him to develop his performance and play in the Premier League. \n\"After what happened in the past with other players, I cannot expect absolutely everything, so I would not be surprised in those terms. \n\"We will see, but I think John is strong enough to handle the situation. He's young and it's the first time he's going to have that situation. \n\"Sooner or later, he would go back for the first time to Everton, to Goodison Park. It is the day after tomorrow. It will be easy.\" \nStones has been critical of his form for City and admits he is still adapting to the demands of playing three games a week. View gallery \n\"Definitely, my performances dipped and I made a few silly mistakes that I've tried to correct now,\" he said. \n\"It’s only natural that these things happen, playing so many games. It's new to me, playing three games a week some weeks and I've got to find a way to adapt myself.\" \nGuardiola is relaxed about Stones' development and is confident he can help him realise his full potential. \n\"I said many times, he's a young player and this is the first time he's played at a high level, three games a week,\" said the Catalan. \n\"He has lots and lots of time to get better and we are available to help him to achieve his huge potential that I'm pretty sure he has.\" Stones in action for Everton in pre-season (Photo: Reuters) \nStones would undoubtedly have benefited from having Vincent Kompany playing alongside him regularly and Guardiola admits he does not know if his skipper will ever get back to his best. \nKompany, 30, is in contention to make his latest comeback at Everton after two months out with a knee problem - his 35th injury since 2008. \n\"I don't know,\" said Guardiola when asked if Kompany can return to old levels. \"It's a good question. It's not the first time we have talked about that. \n\"The good news is he's back and hopefully he stays fit for a long time because then we will see what level he is at. \n\"When he's fit, he's at the top level, we cannot deny how good Vincent is. But to achieve that maybe he needs a bit of time. \n\"He needs weeks and weeks and weeks of training sessions and to just go out there and play the games.\" poll loading Will John Stones be booed at Goodison? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T18:11:31.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
