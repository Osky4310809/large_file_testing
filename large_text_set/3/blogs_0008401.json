They must earn less, that's all.\" \nAnd Piers was only too keen to take Korwin-Mikke to task on International Women's Day .

The blonde earns more than a brunette. They are different, and it should not be equalised.\" \nHe then turned to 'science' in a bid to back up his claims, explaining that \"it is proved\" women are \"less intelligent by several points on the IQ scale\". Janusz Korwin-Mikke has sparked headlines this week (Photo: ITV) \nAt one point during the fraught exchange, Piers told him that he was a \"horrendous sexiest pig\" – prompting Korwin-Mikke to brand Piers an \"idiot\" for not believing in science. \nWhen Susanna attempted to speak over the politician, Piers backed her up, telling him to shut up and listen. \nSusanna then branded his scientific claims \"utter nonsense\" and told him he couldn’t possibly condone a gender pay gap on the basis of height. \nBut the MEP fought back, complaining that Piers and Susanna still believed in stereotypes. Piers branded Korwin-Mikke a \"sexist pig\" (Photo: ITV) \n\"We believe in stereotypes!\" Piers exploded. \"Is that a joke? My god man, you've got some front.You've been married three times, have eight children by four different women … You're an incredibly stupid man.\" \nAfter the GMB hosts wrapped up the outrageous segment, Susanna said: \"That's one of the most interesting interviews I've ever witnessed. And I do feel like I sat on the sidelines while two men discussed women's intelligence.\" \nViewers took to Twitter to exclaim over the eye-opening interview, with many praising Piers for his no-nonsense stance. The MEP refused to back down or apologise (Photo: ITV) \n\"That was the most awkward interview ever, @piersmorgan I'm literally crying laughing whilst watching through my fingers!\" said one. \n\"Piers confronting Janusz Korwin-Mikke about his obnoxious opinions should put to bed any accusation of Piers being sexist,\" said another. \nSusanna, meanwhile, tweeted: \"Women the world over are grateful for his explanation.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T15:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T11:24:28.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
