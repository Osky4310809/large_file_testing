Lee is a Brooklyn-born, Korean-American veteran of both Top Chef and The Mind of a Chef who is now based in Louisville, Kentucky. This ham is the ultimate expression of his many life experiences; it’s a big, beautiful meat roast that is truly unlike any you’ve ever had before. \nForget honey. Lee glazes his ham not only with the gochujang chili sauce, but also with apple juice, maple syrup, Worcestershire, and a touch of espresso.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T09:45:39.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
