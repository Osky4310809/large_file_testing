The artists selected for the project each donated a song to raise money that will support a development fund for the Bronx-based museum. \nIn honor of the event, the masterminds behind the UHHM, including executive director Rocky Bucano, Hip Hop legend Kurtis Blow , Fu-Schnickens MC Chip Fu , Hip Hop historian Paradise Gray , and Grand Wizzard Theodore, have shared a four-track sampler of the album, with music from Fu and producer/MC Black Milk, Atlanta newcomer Supa Peach (who was also a contestant on Jermaine Dupri’s reality show, The Rap Game), South African producer MexiCan, and The Formula. \nThe music on the 16 Bars 4 Hip Hop sampler spans from classic boom-bap to a more mainstream trap sound with a dash of R&B, but more importantly, it serves a greater purpose of collecting funds to establish a place for Hip Hop culture to live. \n“I am glad to have contributed to this project because it’s important that we have a place to preserve our Hip Hop history,” Chip Fu tells DX. “So contributing the song, ‘R U Ready,’ along with co-producing ‘Heal The World’ featuring Chris Rivers, who is Big Pun’s son, and Bad Boy alumni Sire with my partner Greg ‘Speed’ Brown is an incredible thing. I feel like we are laying the foundation for something that’s not only important to the culture, but also to us as a people.” \nCheck out the album sampler below. \nGet The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
