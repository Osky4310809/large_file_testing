Bernie Sanders (I-VT) during the proceedings. The self-described democratic socialist asked DeVos if she would be willing to work with him on making public colleges and universities tuition-free. \n“Senator, I think that’s a really interesting idea,” said DeVos. “And it’s really great to consider and think about, but I think we also have to consider the fact that there’s nothing in life that’s truly free. Somebody is going to pay for it,” she added. \nDemocrats also seemed to have made a huge deal about DeVos’ donations. Sanders even said , \"Do you think if you were not a multimillionaire -- if your family has not made hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions to the Republican Party, that you would not be sitting here today?” \nSanders and other Senate Democrats seem to miss the fact that DeVos’ organizations have given millions of dollars to hundreds of Democrats who support school choice initiatives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T15:34:42.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
