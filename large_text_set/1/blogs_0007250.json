After the CIA included what is looking increasingly like fabricated nonsense in their official classified intelligence report (something we noted earlier here ), Trump took to Twitter to confirm that it is \"A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE\" and questioned whether we're \"living in Nazi Germany.\" Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is \"A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.\" Very unfair! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 I win an election easily, a great \"movement\" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? \n— Donald J.
