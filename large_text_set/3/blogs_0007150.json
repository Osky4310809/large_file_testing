He combines 3D renders of the human form with simulations of smoke, fur, and organic forms to, he tells Creators, \"get the viewer confused.\" \nThe self-taught motion graphics designer has developed a sugary color palette that he brings to life using the powerful combination of Cinema 4D, Zbrush, Marvelous Designer, and Houdini.
