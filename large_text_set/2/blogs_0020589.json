Lincoln, who plays Rick Grimes in the popular AMC series is the latest victim of a celebrity death hoax.\nAccording to Snopes , the prank news article purported that Lincoln had died in a car accident at the age of 43. “Walking Deads’ next episode will not be airing,” the preview claimed. However, the article actually reveals itself to be nothing more than a prank. Clicking the link, which was widely shared on social media, will show it’s just a hoax. The “create a prank and share it” page claims the prank “trolled” more than 3 million people.\n\nLincoln, who is best known for his roles in “The Walking Dead” and “Love Actually,” did not die in a car crash—he is the latest victim of a viral internet death hoax. Other celebrity death hoaxes have included Adam Sandler , John Amos , Reginald VelJohnson and more.\nRecently, Lincoln spoke with Entertainment Weekly about what it was like entering the “pit of hell” during Sunday’s “The Walking Dead” episode:\nIt was insane. I lost my mind that day. It was so much fun. Mike Satrazemis, who does the camera work, loves getting hurt as much as I do, and he sent me a shot of me all bandaged and bruised and cuts and blood everywhere, looking as happy as I’ve ever been in the pit — in this dirty, smelly environment, and it’s just like, what a life! It was just such a gas, that whole episode. It was just a breath of fresh air. It’s insane.\nSee how social media reacted to the death hoax below:\nSocial Media Reacts to Andrew Lincoln Death Hoax I literally started crying in class I hate y'all all. #AndrewLincoln is not dead hoax\n— Queen (@emylerpafford) February 23, 2017 \n\njust started crying in photography bc someone started a rumor that Andrew Lincoln died… I've never been so scared in my life\n— Jiorja (@jvamvakidis) February 23, 2017 \n\nAnyone else heard \"Walking Dead \" Andrew Lincoln \"Rick Grimes\" was killed in a car accident, or it just a joke\n— Matrix Surfer SAM (@USAlivestrong) February 23, 2017 \n\nMy dad just told me Andrew Lincoln was killed in a car crash!
