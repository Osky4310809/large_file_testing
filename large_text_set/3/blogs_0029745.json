Defends Facebook Post Warning Immigrants Of Rumored ICE Raids By Louisa Moller, WBZ-TV March 28, 2017 11:01 PM \nBROCKTON (CBS) – A Massachusetts lawmaker is defending a Facebook post she made alerting immigrants to rumored ICE raids in Brockton. \nState Representative Michelle DuBois (D-10th Plymouth) posted the following on Facebook: \nICE raid in Brockton on 3/28 and 29th If you get picked up by ICE call legal services direct line for immigration help: 774-488-5961 \nI got the following information from my friend in the Latin community: “I have a message for the immigrant community of Brockton. Please be careful on Wednesday 29. ICE will be in Brockton on that day. If you are undocumented don’t go out on the street. If there is a knock on the door of your house and you don’t know who it is, don’t open the door. I ask you to be careful.” \nThe post set off a firestorm of responses and on Tuesday night, DuBois said she did nothing wrong. \n“Passing information along that is already all over the community not only lets the people I represent know what is happening. It lets ICE know that everyone in Brockton is aware of their intended raid if there was one,” DuBois said, reading a statement aloud. \nAsked whether she thought the post could be construed as obstructing justice, she replied, “No, I don’t.” \nDuBois also said she did not see a problem with disseminating a rumor and admitted, she did not contact ICE before doing so. State Rep. Michelle DuBois D-Plymouth (WBZ-TV) \n“It’s information in my community,” she replied. \nThe move upset Brockton resident, Jerry Terminiello, who attended a public meeting held by DuBois to get some answers. \n“I think she stepped over a line,” Terminiello said, “I’m not against immigration but criminals, if you’re an illegal immigrant and a criminal I think you should go.” \nBristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson also weighed in on the controversy while testifying before lawmakers on Capitol Hill .

At least somebody is doing something. At least somebody says something. A lot of people want to speak up but they’re afraid,” said Felicita Sepulveda from The Family Center. \nICE said it does not release information regarding future operations and does not conduct random sweeps, checkpoints or raids. \n“Any person who actively incites panic or fear of law enforcement is doing a disservice to the community, endangering public safety and the very people they claim to support and represent,” ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:11:42.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
