Yahoo is in the process of notifying all potentially affected account holders. Yahoo has invalidated the forged cookies so they cannot be used again.\" \nYahoo's notification could be timely with reports of a tentative renegotiated deal for Verizon's acquisition of the company, giving the telecom giant a $250 million discount on its original $4.8 billion bid. \nThis forged cookie spoofing tactic \"has been around for years (and) ... seems unlikely that Yahoo wouldn't have known about this,” said Ryan O'Leary, vice president of the Threat Research Center and technical support at WhiteHat Security in Santa Clara, Calif. So it could be that \"they wanted to release this as Yahoo, so that they didn’t have to release it as Verizon later on,” he said. \nCookies are long string of letters and numbers that your computer stores to make it easy to log into a site when you return. \"When you get to the site, it sees the cookie and knows who you are and logs you in automatically,” O'Leary said. \nThe bad news? “If hackers steal that cookie, they can use it to log into your account,\" O'Leary said. \nYahoo declined comment about the timing and size of the user notifications. \nIn addition to the 2014 breach, Yahoo also disclosed in December 2016 what is expected to be the largest reported data breach ever, involving the theft of data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August 2013. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly investigating both breaches and whether Yahoo should have notified investors sooner about the incidents. Yahoo noted in a November 2016 SEC filing that it was cooperating with the the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and other federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies including \"a number of State Attorneys General, and the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York.\" \nMore:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:21:15.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
