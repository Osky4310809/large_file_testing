Tazzy 0:40 The Mail: Gun Storm prop’s contract secret, Wests Tigers go shopping, Tyrone Peachey’s Origin chances February 23, 2017 6:00am @jimmyhooper Source: FOX SPORTS THE gun prop secretly off contract, Peachey ripe for the picking, and a Titans star meets with Wests Tigers. \nFox Sports chief NRL reporter James Hooper brings you all the big-ticket items in rugby league every Thursday in his new column, The Mail. \nSTORM’S CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET \nHE’S regarded as one of the NRL’s premier front row forwards — but Melbourne Storm and Kiwi Test captain Jesse Bromwich is also secretly off-contract. \nWhen the Storm trumpeted a four-year extension back in March 2014, what the club left out was Bromwich has an option in his favour for the final year of the deal. \nWhich means right now one of the best props in the game is a free agent. Jesse Bromwich is one of the NRL’s best forwards. Source: News Corp Australia \nThe Storm are well advanced in negotiations about extending Bromwich, 27, beyond next season. \nThere is even a succession plan when Cameron Smith retires to make the Kiwi Test skipper the Storm’s next captain. \nSmith is currently contracted until the end of next season, when the champion hooker will be 35. \nWhile convincing Bromwich to leave the Melbourne Storm would be no easy assignment, the New Zealand Warriors would certainly be interested if the front-rower was looking to return home. \n‘PEACH’ RIPE FOR THE PICKING \nIT’S not just the eighth Immortal Andrew Johns who is talking up electric Panthers centre Tyrone Peachey. The Parramatta Eels were openly talking about how Peachey carved them up in last weekend’s trial. \nAnd Joey tossing his name up for Origin is by no means out of left field. Peachey came within a whisker of winning a spot on the NSW interchange bench during last year’s series. \nIf he starts this season the same way he finished last year — on fire — then expect the Blues to usher him into the representative arena. \nIn terms of the Eels, look for Kaysa Pritchard to be named at hooker for the club’s round one clash with Manly at Lottoland (that still feels weird), otherwise known as Brookvale Oval. Tyrone Peachey has impressed with his last 12 months. Source: News Corp Australia \nSTICKY ATTRACTS A CROWD \nTHERE’S no doubting Ricky Stuart’s ability to pull a heavy hitting crowd. \nA mix of sporting types came from far and wide to attend the annual Ricky Stuart Foundation golf day in Canberra on Monday. Despite reports of tension between ARLC chairman John Grant and NRL CEO Todd Greenberg prior to Christmas, the two most senior NRL executives were both on deck. \nJockeys Jim Cassidy and Simon Marshall also enjoyed a round of golf along with champion All Black Andrew Mehrtens. \nAll money raised goes to Ricky Stuart House, which creates awareness and understanding of what autism is and supports the aftercare of autistic people and provides help for their families. \nHAYNE NO CERTAINTY \nTITANS superstar Jarryd Hayne has been telling people he could be in doubt for Gold Coast’s round one clash with the Sydney Roosters due to a knee injury. \nHayne picked up the injury in the Auckland Nines and has been on restricted training duties over the past fortnight. \nWhen we checked with the Titans, they assured us the club’s star signing would definitely be fit and available for round one. \nTIGERS GO TO MARKET Wests Tigers have held discussions with Chris McQueen. Source: News Corp Australia \nSPEAKING of the Gold Coast, Titans backrower Chris McQueen was in Sydney on Wednesday to meet with the Wests Tigers. \nThe forward who represented England in last year’s Four Nations isn’t the only one on the Concord club’s radar either. Aside from Sydney Roosters prop Kane Evans, Melbourne Storm young gun Felise Kaufusi is also on Wests hit list. \nLook for Kaufusi to win the Storm right edge starting position made vacant by Kevin Proctor. As for Wests, the retention of captain Aaron Woods is essential. \nIf local junior Woods remains a Tiger, the club stands a much stronger chance of retaining the other big three off-contract young guns. \nHaving virtually carried the Tigers pack single-handedly for the last three seasons, Woods has earned a pay day to match his standing as a current NSW and Australian front rower. \nARTHUR, FORAN MOVE ON \nTHEY once shared a father-son relationship, with Brad Arthur’s pulling power strong enough to lure Kieran Foran away from the Manly Sea Eagles. \nForan was a key element of Manly’s drive towards the title in 2011, but four years later he opted to leave the Sea Eagles to link with archrivals Parramatta. \nThe man who masterminded his exit was Eels coach Arthur, who promptly opted to make Foran the club’s captain for last year. \nThe way it all unravelled was easily the most bizarre and hard-to-fathom plot of the 2016 season. \nWhen Foran initially walked out, Arthur was fuming. But when they bumped each other at the Auckland Nines earlier this month, there was a handshake. \nArthur is one of those hardline professionals who only concerns himself with what’s occurring within the walls of his own club. \nThe Eels went through hell last season but the roster Arthur has assembled appears more than capable of powering into the finals. Brad Arthur and Kieran Foran once had an extremely close relationship. Source: News Corp Australia \nWARRIORS BOXING CLEVER \nSTILL on the Warriors, rival clubs are currently fuming about some of the signings CEO Jim Doyle has been able to land. \nThe most common line is what salary cap are the Auckland-based outfit operating under? \nBut on closer inspection, there’s a strong argument it’s simply astute roster management. \nEnglish fullback Sam Tomkins was signed on a ridiculously over-inflated figure, which allowed the club to go out and sign Roger Tuivasa-Scheck from the Sydney Roosters on a deal worth considerably less. \nAnd for all the furore about Tohu Harris joining from the Melbourne Storm next season, what’s been largely glossed over is the club has told Ryan Hoffman he will be released at the end of this year. \nHoffman signed a three-year deal worth around $1.6 million back in 2014. \nHis departure at the end of this season was another reason why new coach Stephen Kearney opted to appoint Roger Tuivasa-Scheck as the Warriors new skipper for this season. \nDo you live in Queensland?
