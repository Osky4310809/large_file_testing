Some analysts and investors fear that the same fate could befall Snapchat, whose user growth has slowed down recently.\nThe company’s shares will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the ticker “SNAP.”\nThe company initially targeted a valuation in its IPO between $20 and $25 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported . At the end of 2016, the company calculated that the fair value of its shares was $16.33, according to its IPO filing.\nWill Alden and Alex Kantrowitz contributed reporting to this article", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/snap-sets-valuation-at-19-5-billion-to-22-2-billion-sources-say-1487221327"], "published": "2017-03-02T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:50:08.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
