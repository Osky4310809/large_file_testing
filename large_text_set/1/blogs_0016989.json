(Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Capital Concerts) ORG XMIT: 650575581 ORIG FILE ID: 545011244 (Photo: Paul Morigi, Getty Images for Capital Concert) \nIf you've been anywhere on social media in the past month, you've undoubtedly seen the name \"Jackie Evancho.\" \nThe 16-year-old classical singer (and America's Got Talent alum) was hit by a tidal wave of attention when it was announced that she will perform the national anthem at Donald Trump's presidential inauguration Friday. While many were supportive of the soft-spoken teen — contributing to a minor sales spike during the holidays — others were critical of her decision to sing for the outspoken president-elect, especially considering that her sister, 18-year-old Juliet Evancho, is transgender . \nIf the backlash has gotten to Evancho, she certainly doesn't show it. \"I am feeling nervous, but I'm very excited and I can't wait to just get it done and live in the moment,\" she says. Ever since she was invited to perform last month, \"I've been practicing every other day, even standing outside and practicing because it's going to be freezing that day.\" \nEvancho, who will release a still-untitled new album this spring, caught up with USA TODAY to discuss the inauguration and online hatred. Get to know Jackie Evancho, Trump's Inauguration Day singer \nQ: You performed for Donald Trump once before (at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in 2011 ). What do you remember about him? \nA: He was actually very polite; grateful that I was there to perform. It was a great experience. \nQ: Despite all the controversy around his election and politics, why did you decide to perform at his inauguration? \nA: Because it's an honor to perform for my country and I don't really do politics. So I don't let that stand in between an honor to perform for the country. \nQ: I understand that your sister won't be attending . Will the rest of your family be there? \nA: Everyone except for my sister and my mom will be attending, yeah. \nQ: How did your sister react to the news that you’ll be performing, given Mike Pence’s track record with opposing LGBTQ rights ? \nA: She was very supportive of me because she views it the exact same way that I do. It's not exactly about the politics of the event, it's about the honor. Springsteen cover band won't play at Trump's inauguration \nQ: How do you cope with the hateful messages you’ve received on social media? Are you able to block them out? \nA: Yeah, for the most part. There's nothing else you can do. My family and I just kind of ignore it as if it wasn't there. \nQ: Was there one particular note that ever really got to you or made you take a step back from social media? \nA: No, there are a million different opinions out there. People are always going to state it, whether it's hateful or not. And that's no reason to back out of anything or shut down anything, unless you really need a break from it all. But I don't really need a break from it, because I don't pay much attention to it. \nQ: Your sister has similarly gotten backlash as she's advocated against trans discrimination . Has this experience brought you closer? \nA: It has and we've always been very close, but just to kind of put up with stuff like that brings our family closer. Marie Osmond: I'm not performing at inauguration \nQ: What has been one of the most invaluable lessons you’ve learned these past couple months? Do you feel you've become stronger as a person? \nA: I definitely do. It's kind of a milestone for me to be standing up for something that I believe in, and still get all of this hate and be OK with it. I'm no stranger to hate, but it's kind of different in this situation, because I've been under the public eye a lot more recently, so a lot more hate comes in. But I get all the support, too, so I've learned to pay attention to the support rather than the hate. \nQ: As a young woman, are there any political causes you feel strongly about or hopes you have for the next four years? \nA: I honestly just hope that things get better in general. I know that America is not in the best state, so I just hope that something becomes improved. \nQ: Do you plan to vote in the next election? \nA: I don't know, honestly. That's four years away! \nQ: Is there another milestone you'd like to check off after this? \nA: Well, actually, because I've performed for ( President Barack Obama ) and I will be performing for our next, I'm thinking it might be fun to try and perform for as many presidents as possible. That'd be fun. 4 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k4Yefz NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
