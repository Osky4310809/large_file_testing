It is good to know that on this side of the negotiating table at least our fears and concerns are being taken seriously and there is a genuine desire to see us protected . Lib Dems support the idea that individual UK citizens who want to should be allowed to keep their links with the EU https://t.co/FxdhctBXoA — BremainInSpain (@BremainInSpain) 19 March 2017 \n“ We would love to believe that the British government has our best interests at heart too. However, they have done nothing to demonstrate this despite continuing to say that they are acting in our best interests. \n“If that were true they would have unilaterally safeguarded the rights of EU citizens in the UK by now, as their exiting the EU select committee recommended,” Wilson added. \nEarlier this month, British MPs rejected a House of Lords suggestion that the government must guarantee that the rights of EU citizens residing in the UK will remain unchanged post-Brexit. \nPrime Minister Theresa May also announced that the government will trigger Article 50 on March 29, initiating the process for Britain to leave the EU and launching formal negotiations with European leaders, where the issue of expats’ rights is likely to be top of the agenda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:48:58.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
