Another key element to the arrest came from the type of witness Father Michael Pleger praises. \n“Working with conviction and conscious community people who are not willing to stand by and see children shot down and not do something about it,” he said. \nSwan has nine felony arrests and seven convictions dating back to 2008 on his record. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said a repeat offender like him should not be on the streets. \n“We don’t just have a gun problem in Chicago, we have a repeat gun offender problem that needs to be addressed immediately by state legislators,” he said. \nPolice have not clarified if Swan was one of a possible four individuals involved in the Valentine’s Day shooting. They believe two of those four suspects were armed and are still looking for them. Sandra Torres Sandra Torres is a general assignment reporter for CBS 2.
