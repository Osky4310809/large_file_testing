He admitted back in October that he hadn’t watched the under-18s live at Kirkby since his second day in the job 12 months earlier. \n“Last season we had absolutely no time,” Klopp said. “It’s one of the reasons why we really think about possibly all coming together here. It would be easier. You wouldn’t need to drive between two different places.” \nKlopp knows it would also be a source of inspiration for kids walking out to train and seeing the likes of Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino working nearby. \nThe German coach has felt constrained by a lack of space at Melwood where the indoor facility is small and dated. There’s also a shortage of meeting rooms and offices. \nThere will be no such issues at Kirkby with the purchase of playing fields from Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council set to boost the size of the site to 60 acres.

That should help prevent team information from leaking out. Currently, fans use bins, cars or ladders to look over the walls at Melwood and watch training. \nLeaving Melwood is a big step for Liverpool considering it has been home since the 1950s. It was Bill Shankly who transformed the place in the 1960s and then Gerard Houllier brought it into the 21st century when he oversaw a major redevelopment in 2001. \nThree years earlier the new Academy in Kirkby opened its doors after the decision was taken to have a dedicated youth development base elsewhere.

There is definitely more value in having everyone together.” \nWith owners Fenway Sports Group vowing to back Klopp’s vision, it’s now set to become a reality. If everything goes to plan Klopp will be taking training in sparkling new surroundings in July 2019. poll loading Will Liverpool win the title with Klopp? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:32:36.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
