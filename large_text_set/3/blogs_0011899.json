Tailing closely behind is a vintage 1995 freestyle from the late, great Notorious B.I.G . and Flatbush Zombies’ previously unreleased track, “Babel.” Music from Rick Ross and Gucci Mane, DJ Premier and Miguel, and Troy Ave follows closely behind. A collaborative track between Public Enemy’s Chuck D and newcomer Jabee, Chief Keef and Gucci Mane’s “Jet Li,” a video from notorious battle rapper Math Hoffa, and an instrumental from Tommy Boy Records’ Funkontrol also round out the list. BADBADNOTGOOD f. SNoop Dogg –“Lavender (Nightfall Remix)” \nCanadian music collective BADBADNOTGOOD has enlisted the vocal talents of the inimitable Snoop Dogg and stellar production from Kaytranada for the brooding new single, “Lavender (Nightfall Remix),” and swiftly followed up with a politically-charged video. Directed by Jesse Wellens and James DeFina, the video starts with a family of clowns enjoying a bowl of “Snoop Loops” before the patriarch, played by actor/director Michael Rapaport, heads out the door, gets in his car and lights up a joint on his way to work. After being pulled over by a clown-faced cop, the video takes an ugly turn and touches on police brutality before Snoop delivers a shocking (yet hilarious) blow at the end. Watch the video above. The notorious b.i.G. –“unearthed vintage freestyle” \nAlways the treasure trove of unearthed gems, British radio host Tim Westwood is back with a vintage Biggie Smalls freestyle, which comes only days after the 20th anniversary of the Brooklyn legend’s murder. The video was shot during a 1995 session with Bad Boy’s Craig Mack and Puffy in his London studio. It’s a rare and fully mastered 10-minute clip featuring Mack and Biggie trading bars. #RIPBIGGIESMALLS Flatbush zombies –“babel” \nFlatbush Zombies have returned with a fresh new single “Babel” featuring production from The Architect. March 11, 2016 marked the release of Zombies‘ debut album 3001: A Laced Odyssey , and dropped off the previously unreleased track in honor of the occasion. Rick ross F. Gucci mane –“She’s on my dick” \nAhead of Rick Ross’ Rather You Than Me release on Friday (March 17), the Carol City, Florida representing rapper has rolled through with another teaser from the project in the form of “She’s On My Dick” with Gucci Mane. Of course, when taking the song title into consideration, there’s really no mystery as to what the song involves. DJ Premier f. Miguel –“2 lovin u” \nAfter unveiling the single last month, DJ Premier is back with a video for “2 Lovin U” with singer Miguel. The collaboration serves as the first official release on Preemo’s recently established imprint, TTT (To The Top) Records. The duo has now unveiled the video for the track, which features Premier cutting it up in a warehouse and Miguel singing right along to the funky cut. troy ave –“real eyes realize real lies” \nTroy Ave just won’t quit. Although he’s been embroiled in several legal woes over the past year, his musical input remains strong. His new video for “Real Eyes Realize Real Lies” finds him revisiting his Roland Collins project for a video that touches on what his reality has looked like in the recent past — jail and courtrooms. His next effort, Dope Boy Troy , is expected March 24. jabee f. chuck d – “monument” \nIt takes a lot for Public Enemy mastermind Chuck D t o jump on a track, so the fact he’s on Jabee’s new single, “Monument,” is a huge co-sign for the young artist. Produced by Hannibal King, the song starts with Chuck’s wise words repeating in his head and that theme continues throughout. In the video, although Chuck doesn’t physically appear in it, he’s really there the whole time as Jabee walks hand in hand with two little children with the words “Black Future” graffiti across the wall. Chief keef f. gucci mane –“jet li” \nChief Keef has dug deep into his archives to pull out 2013’s “Jet Li” featuring Gucci Mane. In true braggadocio fashion, it’s all about how much money they have, the fancy cars they drive and their numerous “ladies.” Math hoffa –“love is on the way” \nBattle rapper Math Hoffa has dropped a new video for “Love Is On The Way” filmed in black and white. Directed by Tha Embassy Elite, the video features the MC rapping about the ebbs and flows of his career. The track is taken from his forthcoming project pacjuice pt 1. Funkontrol –“banker’s club” \nFunkontrol has rolled through with its Tommy Boy Records’ debut. Titled “Banker’s Club,” the track serves as the first single from the electronic duo’s forthcoming album.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:31:36.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
