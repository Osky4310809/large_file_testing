It isn’t just the audience, which is modest in size compared to the arenas they often play. It’s the history of the Opry, the legends who have played and still play the sacred stage, and it’s knowing that the folks who buy the tickets are not casual country music fans. They love it. \nCrystal Gayle was feeling jitters when she was preparing to take the stage on Jan. 21, but she had an even better reason to be nervous. It was the night she would become an official member of the institution. And the icing on the cake? Her sister, the legendary Loretta Lynn, would be performing the honors. \nRELATED: Carrie Underwood had the honor of asking Crystal Gayle this big question \nIn the cozy cafe adjacent to the historic Ryman Auditorium, Crystal told reporters that, as a little girl, she wanted her famous big sister’s approval. “I always looked up to my sister,” she said. “Even as a little 4-year-old. I’d tell my mother, I’d put lipstick on and say, ‘Do you think Loretta would think me pretty?’ I do look up to my sister, and she is fantastic.” \nLoretta was equally as adoring of the baby of the family. “I have been proud of her ever since she’s been on this Earth, but I am so proud she’s getting to be a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Now we’re both members.” A video posted by Buddy Norris (@buddysplacenashville) on Jan 21, 2017 at 8:43pm PST \nBut keep in mind, they are still siblings, and Loretta also wasn’t above telling us that Crystal was a bit of a pill as a child. “She was mean, I can tell you that much,” she said with a smile. “She was the meanest little thing, because she was petted and petted. She was! She was the baby, and we all had her petted. She’s still the baby, and she’s still petted.” \nCrystal explained that she was mean because she would get in fights with her big sister’s two sons — “But they said I fought dirty because I would bite.” \n“And you would pinch. You pinched me,” Loretta chimed in. \n“I did,” Crystal said. \n“Yes, and I spanked your butt.” \n“I’m sorry I pinched you.” \n“I’m sorry I spanked you.” \nRELATED: You must hear this classic medley of country hits from Loretta Lynn and Crystal Gayle \nThe fun continued on the Opry stage with Loretta performed hits like “Fist City” and “You’re Ain’t Woman Enough,” then Crystal came out to sing fan favorite “Don’t it Make My Brown Eyes Blue,” along with the song she sang at her Opry debut, “Ribbon of Darkness.” After the official presentation and welcome into the country music family, where Loretta explained that she named Crystal after a chandelier, the two sisters welcomed their other sibling, Peggy Sue, for a memorable performance by the coal miner’s daughters.
