Read More \nAs the Radio 4 Today presenter grilled Mr Farage he initially ducked the question, turning his fire back on Mr Carswell. \nScroll down for the full transcript Nigel Farage was questioned about his desire for a knighthood again and again (Photo: Getty) \nEventually he said he didn't \"particularly\" want a knighthood - but then added tantalisingly: \"If something came along I might accept it.\" \nMr Farage gave a similar response yesterday, when he ignored a question about whether he was so anti-establishment he wouldn't take a gong. \nMr Farage fumed: \"He will do anything he can to damage leading figures in Ukip. He's working for the Conservatives, it's plain for all to see.\" \nFormer Farage aide Michael Heaver compared Mr Carswell to a Soviet spy. \n\"Forget U-K-I-P, it was more KGB,\" he told the BBC. \"This is not conspiracy. This is fact.\" Douglas Carswell has been compared by enemies to a KGB spy... (Photo: Reuters) \nMaking the row even more absurd, Ukip donor Arron Banks is now planning to run against only MP Mr Carswell at the next election. \nMillionaire Banks' spokesman said the knighthood row was the \"final straw\". \nUkip had formally demanded a knighthood for Mr Farage in January claiming he was a \"figure of international signiÔ¨Åcance\". ... and donor Arron Banks is planning to stand against him at the next election (Photo: PA) \nBut in an e-mail leaked to the Telegraph Mr Carswell - who was responsible for pushing the bid for a knighthood in Westminster - suggested Mr Farage could be handed an OBE \"for services to headline-writing\". \nThat suggested Mr Carswell did not want Mr Farage, who he has fought in the past, to be knighted. \nThe MP denied this, saying: \"I made every effort to make sure Ukip got its fair share of peerages and honours.\" \nBut he did tweet \"knight night\" as the story broke. That toe-curling exchange in full \nFARAGE: The time has now come to have a clean break to make sure we don't have influences like [Douglas] Carswell. \nBBC INTERVIEWER: This isn't because you rather dislike him because he stopped you getting a knighthood? It's not sour grapes is it? \nI dislike him because he damaged me, Ukip and the Leave campaign... \nStopped you getting a knighthood? \n...no, back in December 2015. And I said then to the party's ruling body we've got to get rid of this guy, they didn't listen to me, he did his best, all through the referendum, to undermine me. He wasn't able to do so, I'm pleased to say. Paul Nuttall needs to be given a clear run at this. \nAnd it's got nothing to do with your knighthood at all then? \nNo I've been campaigning to get rid of him for a very long time. \nBut it's got nothing to do with your knighthood, is the question? \nWell, no, erm, whether I would have ever got one or not I have no idea, but the point, the point is, is he will do anything he can to damage leading figures in Ukip. He's working for the Conservatives, it's plain for all to see. \nWhat about you, would you like a knighthood? \nEr, I'd like to see Britain leave the European Union. \nWould you like a knighthood? \nNot particularly. \nOh! Well that solves it then in that case, you don't want one, they won't offer one. What about a peerage then? \nNope, wouldn't want one at all. \nSo you don't want anything? \nI would not want a peerage. If something else came along I might accept it.
