By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 3, 2017 10:58 AM Arvind Kejriwal lends his voice to a video made for party’s municipal election campaign. (Source: PTI) \nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has once again attacked the two big political parties of India, Congress and BJP for failing to work for citizens of Delhi in last 20 years. He lends his voice to a video made for party’s municipal election campaign and asked people whether they are happy with the state of cleanliness in Delhi. “Kya aap Dilli main safai se khush hain? Nahi na. Chaaron taraf kooda hi kooda hai. Sharam aati hai Dilli ko desh ki rajdhani kehte hue… Dilli main saaf-safai MCD ki zimmedari hai, Dilli sarkar ki nahi,” said the Aam Aadmi Party in a direct attack on Bharatiya Janata Party who currently governs MCD. \n“MCD has revenue from house tax, advertisements, parking, conversion charges etc; but all of this is lost to corruption. Those who ride a bicycle before elections suddenly buy 5 bungalows, big cars and plots after being elected. They steal our money. There is no work that gets completed without paying a bribe. They don’t even give death certificate without bribes,” he added. \nDeputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia met few teachers on Thursday: \nAddressing the monetary issues of the Aam Aadmi Party, he cleared that AAP doesn’t have the funds to contest elections and urged people to show support. He said,”We don’t have money to contest the election. You have to help us. One person should tell 100 people to vote for AAP. We have to clean Delhi. Tell your colleagues and customers. Give all 272 seats to AAP so that Delhi is cleaned. You have seen Congress and BJP. Both are corrupt. Only AAP works for you.” \nIn the video, he also asked people to compare the work by BJP and Congress in MCD with the work done by AAP government in last 2 years. AAP released its first list of candidates last week and is fighting the election on the agenda of free water, low electricity bills, government school revamp and mohalla clinics. In last year’s Municipal by polls, Aam Aadmi Party won 5 out of 13 seats.
