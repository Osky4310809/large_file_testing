As the Southern California-based company just started franchising last year, this will be one of the first of its kind. \nThe product line includes pastry, sandwiches, and coffee. \nParis Baguette has one local outlet - a shop inside the H Mart in Elkins Park. \nThe neighborhood is expanding foodwise, as Jose Garces is looking for a spring debut of his taqueria Buena Onda down the block at 1735 Chestnut St.; New York-based 10Below ice cream is expected to open in late winter around the corner at 42 S. 17th St.; and Saxbys is setting up a coffee shop at 1800 Chestnut. \nChristina Zipf of CBRE Fameco handled the real estate transaction for the landlord, Samson Properties. \nvia Paris Baguette January 31, 2017 — 1:35 AM EST | Updated: January 31, 2017 — 12:37 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
