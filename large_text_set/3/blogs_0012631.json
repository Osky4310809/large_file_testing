In the now-famous viral clip, East Asian affairs expert Robert Kelly, 44, was on a Skype call with the BBC to discuss the impeachment of South Korea’s president. This staid interview turned into comedy gold when Kelly’s 4-year-old daughter, Marion, and then his 8-month-old son, James, burst into his unlocked room as he struggled to maintain his composure.\nKelly’s panicked wife, Kim Jung-A, then jumped in to grab the tiny interlopers — trying uselessly to avoid being caught on camera.\n“Oww, Mommy!” Marion screamed.\nThe straight-laced dad — who had forgotten to lock the door — squirmed apologetically during the episode in his apartment in Busan, South Korea.\n“If you watch the tape, I was sort of struggling to keep my own laughs down. They’re little kids and that’s how things are,” he told the Wall Street Journal .\n“Yes, I was mortified, but I also want my kids to feel comfortable coming to me,” he said. “I made this minor mistake that turned my family into YouTube stars. It’s pretty ridiculous.”\nKelly said that when he began the interview, his family was in the living room to watch the TV appearance, which his wife was shooting on her phone.\nAt one point, Marion jumped up gleefully when she spotted her dad on TV and headed off to see him in person — still in high spirits after her birthday party at kindergarten that day.\nJames followed in his baby walker while Kim remained glued to the TV.\n“As soon as she opened the door, I saw her image on my screen. She was in a hippity-hoppity mood that day because of the school party,” said Kelly, an associate professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea.\nKelly didn’t miss a beat and tried to multi-task by guiding her with his left arm to some toys nearby. Seconds later, James waltzed in.\n“Then I knew it was over,” Kelly said.\n“There’s a first time for everything. I think you’ve got some children who need you,” said the bemused broadcaster, James Menendez.\nThe video had been viewed over 84 million times on the BBC Facebook page as of Tuesday morning.\nIt also generated a bit of controversy when some assumed that Kim was the family nanny, not the exasperated stay-at-home mom.\n“We’re really grateful to Professor Kelly for his professionalism. This just goes to show that live broadcasting isn’t always child’s play,” a BBC spokesman told the Daily Mail .\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:20:36.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
