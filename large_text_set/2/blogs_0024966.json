This is unacceptable,\" Wilders said in a tweet directed at Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. \nWilders has lived for more than a decade under around-the-clock protection and in anonymous safe houses following death threats. \nAn officer from the DBB security team was detained Monday on suspicion of \"sharing classified police information in the private sphere,\" police spokesman Dennis Janus said. The DBB is responsible for security around top politicians, the Dutch royal family and diplomats based in the Netherlands . \nDutch media reported, citing unnamed sources, that the suspect detained Monday is a police officer with a Moroccan background who had passed on information to a Dutch-Moroccan criminal organization. The story first appeared on the website www.NRC.nl . \nIn an interview with BNR Nieuwsradio, National Police Chief Erik Akerboom confirmed that the suspect was of Moroccan descent. \nWilders was convicted last year for anti-Moroccan comments and while campaigning just last weekend referred to \"Moroccan scum\" who commit crimes in the Netherlands. \nThe revelations came three weeks before the Netherlands holds its March 15 parliamentary election. Wilders' party is riding high in the polls, although mainstream parties have said they will not form a coalition with him if he wins the popular vote because of his hard-line anti-Islam stance. His manifesto includes closing Dutch borders to all migrants from Muslim nations, banning the Quran and shutting all mosques in the Netherlands. \nAkerboom told BNR that an investigation was seeking to establish what information was leaked, but said that so far he did not believe that Wilders' safety had been compromised. He said the suspect was not part of the \"inner circle\" responsible for Wilders. \n\"Our highest priority is, of course, his security. And we first of all have done everything to ensure that is and remains guaranteed,\" Akerboom said of Wilders. \nRutte, the Dutch prime minister, and his minister for security and justice on Wednesday visited the heavily-guarded wing of Parliament that houses Wilders' party offices. Rutte declined to discuss the nature of his visit. \nWilders later tweeted that the security breach \"is a serious case that fortunately is also being taken seriously by the Cabinet.\" \n(AP)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:13:06.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
