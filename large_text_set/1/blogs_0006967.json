ADVERTISEMENT \nSources said Gumabao had differences with team officials despite providing leadership to Pocari, which won the SVL Open and Reinforced Conferences, the latter at the expense of Bureau of Customs led by superstar Alyssa Valdez. \nSources said she’s looking for a team “that will bring out the best in her.” \nA stint with either the Cargo Movers or the Tri-Activ Spikers would bring her back to the PSL where she saw action for several teams like Philips Gold, Generika, AirAsia and PCSO. \nIn F2, she could be reunited with Lady Archers teammates Aby Maraño and Cha Cruz along with coach Ramil de Jesus. \nPocari has signed up Gyzelle Sy, Melissa Gohing, Desiree Dadang and Fille Cayetano after inking a P4.6 million deal to retain Myla Pablo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:05:06.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
