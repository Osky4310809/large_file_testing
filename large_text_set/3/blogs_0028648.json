Companies with dedicated video marketing strategies generate more leads , earn more revenue, and enjoy better brand awareness than those engaging in all other forms of marketing. \n\nFacebook, Twitter, and YouTube are great places to get eyes on your video content, but prospects aren’t necessarily in work- or buy-mode as they scroll through these platforms. \nWe do know, however, that 90% of B2B decision-makers use search to research business decisions . To reap the benefits of video marketing, your videos must be optimized for search. By following a few best practices for video SEO, you’ll enjoy more visible video search results and drive more organic traffic—and qualified leads—to your video content. \nHow Does Google Rank Videos? In its general search and video search functions, Google ranks videos using the same ranking factors as written content—content quality, number of backlinks, and RankBrain are the most important signals. When hosting videos on your site, the tasks for optimizing video content are similar to those for written content and images. \nSimilar , but not identical. Here are five steps you should take to improve your search rankings so your videos stand out in search results: \n1. Transcribe Your Video Content Providing both a video and transcription on a single page offers dual benefits: it caters to different reader preferences, and it makes video content more likely to appear in general Google searches. \nVideo transcriptions can be optimized for search in the same way as any other text-based site content. While this may seem to break duplicate content rules, transcriptions actually provide a good user experience by catering to different learning styles. While some visitors may prefer videos, others may prefer reading. In fact, 85% of business executives prefer reading over watching videos when making business decisions. \nWhen transcribing video content, there are two approaches you can take: \nProvide a full, word-for-word transcription as Moz does for their Whiteboard Friday videos. Provide text highlights like Content Marketing Institute does for their This Old Marketing podcast. Full transcripts provide more engagement SEO opportunities, while highlights are good for long videos and can encourage more views by teasing readers with compelling content that’s discussed in more detail in the video. Ultimately, use the approach your audience prefers: you can poll them to find out, or do some A/B testing to see which approach drives the kind of engagement you’re looking for. \n2. Optimize Video File Metadata Just like general search results, titles and descriptions display in video searches. While Google will find something to display if this data isn’t provided, you’ll drive more views and rank higher in results if this metadata is optimized. \nVideo titles and descriptions should: \nBe compelling to encourage click-throughs. Be relevant and applicable to the content. Include keywords that match user intent . Feature titles that are 55 characters or less. Use meta descriptions that are 155 characters or less. Additionally, Google displays a thumbnail for video results. Thumbnails are to videos as images are to blog posts —choosing the right thumbnail is crucial. While most video processing programs will select a thumbnail using a single screen from the video, you should create a custom thumbnail that illustrates video content, attracts attention, and inspires interest. \n3. Implement Schema Markup While some users conduct searches using Google’s video search function, many just use the general search tool. To help videos stand out in general search results, use schema markup (semantic vocabulary) to provide the information search engines need. With schema markup, general search results will appear in the same way as video search results, providing a video thumbnail and length. \nAt a minimum, you’ll need to add schema markup for the title, description, thumbnail, and either embed- or content-URL for each video. You may also want to include video length, upload date, and height and width dimensions. Google has a page describing exactly what it expects from schema markup for videos and allows you to validate schema markup with the Rich Snippet Testing Tool . \n4. Submit a Video Sitemap While Google’s crawlers will discover videos on your site, you can enhance discovery of site-hosted videos by creating a video sitemap a nd submitting it to Google Search Console. Create a separate video sitemap, or add video entries to an existing sitemap. \nEntries in a video sitemap must include video title, description, play page URL, thumbnail, and raw video file URL, and must match the information included on your site. There are a number of optional pieces of data that can be included as well—video duration, rating, view count, category, and live status. While the optional fields do not need to be included in a video sitemap, they provide additional data Google can use to properly index video files. \n5. Find Keywords That Populate Video Results The best way to know if users prefer video content for certain queries is to conduct searches for targeted keywords. If video results appear on the first page of results, it signifies that users are typically satisfied with video content for that query. For example, conducting a Google search for the query “Twitter tutorial” results in a YouTube video in position two, just below the official Twitter support page. \n\nPrioritize video creation for keywords that populate video results in general search and create videos that are higher quality or more comprehensive than those that are already ranking for relevant keywords. \nThe Most Important SEO Video Ranking Factor Video content is held to the same standards as text content in search results—it must be high quality. Optimizing fluff videos isn’t a valuable use of your time because—like general content—engagement factors are important. If people are watching only a few seconds of your video and then leaving, your engagement scores will fall, and Google may determine that your video is either irrelevant to the query or low-quality. \nVideo content should cater to user intent, provide value to viewers, and have a high production value. That doesn’t mean you have to spend a fortune hiring actors or designing animations that make Pixar jealous, but it does mean that videos should be in focus, audio should be clear, and unnecessary pieces should be edited out. \nOnce you’ve created high-quality, engaging videos, upload them to your site, add transcripts, and optimize display in results with metadata, schema markup, and sitemaps. Completing these tasks will enable more visible—and higher ranking—search results for video marketing content. \nWhat other tips and tricks do you have for optimizing video search rankings?
