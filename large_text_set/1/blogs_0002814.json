Regardless, here are some things that will be a quarter of a century in 2017. \nWayne’s World \nOn Valentine’s day of 1992, the SNL sketch graduated to a feature film, and the world was forever grateful. The movie was such a success that it single-handedly made “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen really, really cool. 2 \nThe first text message \n22-year-old Neil Papworth sent the first text on December 3rd over a cellular network. He said “Merry Christmas” to Vodafone GSM Network director Richard Jarvis… via Vodafone of course. 3 \nBarney & Friends \nThe Purple dinosaur hit the small screen on PBS on April 6th. It was initially imagined by Sheryl Leach, a Dallas elementary school teacher in need of toddler-appropriate programming for her kids. 4 \nMall of America \nThe largest mall in the US opened its doors in Bloomington, Minnesota on August 11th. It covers 2.7 million square feet, has 400 stores, 14 movie theaters, seven restaurants, five dance clubs and 31,000 trees and shrubs. 5 \nCartoon Network \nOn October 1st the first all-day channel devoted to cartoons first came on television. The channel was a decision made after TBS bought Hanna-Barbera and its catalog of shows, which consisted of about 1500 hours of animated content.

It’s considered the “grandfather of 3D shooters” and was quickly followed by Doom , which kickstarted the first-person shooter game explosion. 7 \nThe Dream Team \nThe 1992 Summer Olympic Games were in Barcelona from July 25th to August 9th, and they’re best known to Americans for the first US men’s basketball team to include NBA players. The all-star lineup included Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Clyde Drexler, Scottie Pippen and Chris Mullin. They won all eight of their Barcelona games with an average lead of 44 points, bringing home the Gold Medal. 8 \nDr. Dre’s The Chronic \nDr. Dre’s first solo album came out on December 15th. It was his first album outside of NWA and had a ton of cameos by Snoop Dogg, which helped start his career. 9 \nSuper Mario Kart \nThe Mario Kart franchise premiered in Japan on August 27th and on September 1st in the US. The graphics were considered excellent and it went on to sell more than eight million cartridges. 10 \nThe JPEG file format \nResearchers began working on a computer file format in 1982 that would store photographic data. They wanted to compress images so that they would be easier to download and easy to store. The Joint Photographic Experts Group was formed in 1986 to get it going, and on September 18th of 1992 the first JPEG standard was published.
