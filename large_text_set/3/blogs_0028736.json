But he’d be playing some for guy for $100,000.”\nBarkley’s comments come as the relationship between the two has soured in recent years. The TNT analyst recently said his criticism of Jordan as owner of the Charlotte Hornets has caused a fracture in their relationship. The two barely speak anymore, but that hasn’t stopped Barkley from blabbing about his fellow Hall of Famer.\nBarkley recalled a time when he was told to move out of the way for Jordan to take a putt for the small sum of $300,000.\n“It was crazy, man. But I never understood why they were playing for that much,” Barkley said.\nGetty Images While incredulous at his former rival’s betting habits, Barkley admitted to fluttering a little too hard in Las Vegas with his NBA riches.\n“I developed that problem a few years ago. When I went to Vegas, I won a million dollars. I probably won a million dollars five times, but probably lost a million 25 [other times],” Barkley said.\n“I developed this thing where I had to win a million, so I quit gambling for two years. But when I was talking to my close friends I’d say: ‘Man, I really miss gambling.’ And they’d tell me that I should, but I just shouldn’t be an idiot.\n“The key to being successful is to keep good people around you. My friend would say: ‘Dude, you’re just an idiot when you gamble.’ So now when I go to gamble, I just do it to have fun.”\nBarkley has good reason to shy away from huge bets on golf, considering his swing has been labeled the “worst of all time,” earning millions of views on social media.\nFinish this sentence:\nCharles Barkley's golf swing is…… @ACChampionship pic.twitter.com/OOGU4N0GC6 \n— NBC Sports (@NBCSports) July 19, 2015 \n\nBarkley admitted he “sucks at golf” on “The Colbert Report” last year. He said he’s hit a few people with his wild heaves.\n“I don’t like playing charity tournaments … it’s very nerve-racking because once you hit the first person, you get really nervous. I could really hurt somebody. I choke under pressure on the golf course, that’s the only way to explain it,” Barkley said.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on News.com.au .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:04:50.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
