Gullit: Pogba risks becoming next Depay Gullit has a warning for Pogba (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nDutch legend Ruud Gullit has warned Paul Pogba that he is on the same road to Manchester United oblivion as Memphis Depay. \nGullit fears the flashy Frenchman, who rejoined the Reds last summer in a world-record £89million transfer, is making the mistake of putting style before substance and isn’t living the life of a top athlete, writes Mirror Football's Simon Mullock. \n“He may be the most expensive player in the world, but that does not count if he is spending more time on his dress style, the colours in his hair and his social media. \n“Paul should ask Memphis – and he will realise that being successful and reaching top level in England is only possible if you perform every week and if you dedicate everything to your career. \n“Memphis was heavily criticised because he found it more important to pimp his image than improve his football. He should have known that stuff on the pitch goes before anything.\" Griezmann promised No 7 shirt Griezmann continues to be linked with a move to United (Photo: Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno) \nAntoine Griezmann has been promised the No.7 shirt if he completes his expected £70million switch to Manchester United. \nAs Sunday Mirror Sport first revealed, Atletico Madrid forward Griezmann is top of manager Jose Mourinho’s wanted list, writes Mirror Football's John Richardson. \nThe 25-year-old is a boyhood Man United fan and is big friends with their £89million world-record signing Paul Pogba, a French international team-mate. \nGriezmann grew up idolising David Beckham, and with Memphis Depay’s departure to French side Lyon this week the famous number seven shirt — worn with far greater distinction at Old Trafford by Beckham, George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona and Cristiano Ronaldo — is available.
