Adesola Adeduntan \nAdeduntan said the ultimate winners post-recession will be those who are able to see beyond current turbulence that face the economy and continue to make right investments and position their brand for growth. \nSpeaking during the 2017 KPMG Alumni Cocktail with the topic, “Opportunities for Businesses in the Current Economic Recession”, Adeduntan observed that certain attributes will distinguish winners from losers post-recession, “those who are able to create new markets, invest in innovations, human capital development and creativity. Those who are able to either maintain their market share or go the extra mile of snatching market share of competitors and achieve cost leadership are the ones that will emerge as winner post recession.” \nAdeduntan noted that there are several areas which Nigerians can tap into, adding,“agriculture is a good area, because as a country with over 195 million people anything that has to do with feeding ourselves nobody can go wrong with it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:04:22.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
