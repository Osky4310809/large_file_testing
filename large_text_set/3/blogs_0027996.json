We imagine the feeling of staring into deep space was the main inspiration of Anastasia Beverly Hills new Glow Kit . At least, their recent Instagram post would suggest this much.\nThe mystical video promoting the upcoming Anastasia Beverly Hills Glow Kit features dramatic panning shots of the glittery space-themed kit , which gives us a peek of frosty starry blue and white shades (we caught wind of some gold as well).\nThe new kit will be appropriately named Aurora, we imagine because it reflects the beauty of the Aurora Borealis . It could also double as a makeup dedication to Sleeping Beauty . We’ll gladly take both meanings.\nI can breathe!! Aurora she's magical! I didn't know if I could live up to Moonchild, but I'm in love with her sister Aurora! Can't wait to share more. My head is in the clouds 1/2 the time, and it's surreal to bring some of that magic to earth. ☺️#auroraglowkit #anastasiabeverlyhills #norvina \nA post shared by Norvina (@norvina) on Mar 27, 2017 at 12:26pm PDT \nThis is the perfect sister kit for the Anastasia Beverly Hills MoonChild Glow Kit . We can only assume the birth of this makeup family was written in the stars light years ago. The colors are breathtaking (and gravity reducing).\nIntroducing Moonchild and Sweets #GlowKit Launching very soon ✨ $40 each ✨ These kits will be available very soon exclusively available on AnastasiaBeverlyHills.com not available in stores* Please make sure to check our page for launch announcements. We don’t announce launch time/date to avoid heavy traffic and to ensure that everyone has a chance to purchase these kits #anastasiabeverlyhills #moonchildglowkit #sweetsglowkit \nA post shared by Anastasia Beverly Hills (@anastasiabeverlyhills) on Jul 6, 2016 at 2:22pm PDT \nWe will have to hold onto our space helmets for a closer look of the ABH Aurora Glow Kit. \nvia GIPHY \nIn the meantime we can stare into space and search for interstellar swatch previews.
