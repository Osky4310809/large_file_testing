Theatregoers face paying £200 to see Broadway hit Hamilton in London Read more \nTickets for Hamilton on Broadway were like gold dust after rave reviews prompted unprecedented advance box office sales, and Michelle Obama proclaimed it “the best art I have ever seen in my life”. It went on to be nominated for a record 16 Tony awards, picking up 11, and also won a Grammy. \nThe show’s producers introduced strict new measures to combat touts, after 20,000 tickets for Hamilton in New York were snapped up by software designed to bulk-buy tickets online, and resold on secondary ticketing websites. US tickets were originally priced between $139 and $549, but were being touted for upwards of $2,000. \nDespite a paperless ticket system – where ticket holders have to go to the theatre with a confirmation email, the bank card used for the booking and photo ID – being introduced for the West End show, tickets quickly found their way on to secondary ticketing sites. \nCameron Mackintosh, producing the UK run of the show, said he hoped paperless ticketing would help “combat the gouging of the public with hugely inflated ticket prices by third-party profiteers”. \nBut security consultant and ticketing expert Reg Walker, of Iridium Consultancy, said touts could still prosper, despite efforts to shut them out. “It’s great to see the people behind Hamilton trying to stop touting but it’s unlikely to be 100% effective,” he said. \n“It’s viable for a tout to buy four tickets, sell three of them, then go with you to the box office to pick them up using his credit card. He can then walk the ticket purchasers in and walk out again, or even watch the show himself.” \n“At those prices it’s still worth it for them because they make enough on three of the tickets that they don’t mind losing the money they spent on the fourth.” \nSimilar measures to stop touts were attempted by Adele for her recent tour, with only those with their names printed on the tickets supposedly allowed entry, but they still made their way on to resale sights for upwards of £8,000. \nViagogo and other secondary sites such as StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave have come under increasing scrutiny in the past year, prompting the Competition and Markets Authority to announce an investigation into secondary ticketing last month. Broadway blockbusters: why theater attendance is at an all-time high Read more \nNicole Nadig, who lives in New York, will be among those from who will fly to London in 2018 specifically to see Hamilton, having managed to get her hands on early tickets. \n“I’m really excited,” she told the Guardian. “I tried to get tickets in New York earlier in the run last year and was unsuccessful and couldn’t afford to buy them at resale prices, ie $1,000, and by the time more face-value tickets went on sale most of the cast was leaving. \n“When I saw the show was going up in London with most of the original cast I figured I’d wait and see it there. I thought it would be a nice holiday that would probably only be slightly more expensive than two $1,000 Hamilton tickets.” \nAll tickets found being offered on resale sites will be voided. \nMiranda became an advocate of new legislation against secondary ticket-touting in America after he saw touts snap up tens of thousands of tickets for his show. He wrote in the New York Times: “I want you to be there when the curtain goes up. You shouldn’t have to fight robots just to see something you love.” \nThose hoping to get their hands on early tickets for the West End run had to sign up to priority booking last year and were given a code to get their hands on the first batch of tickets, which went on sale on Monday at midday. \nThe tickets were priced between £37.50 and £127.50. Despite massive demand, none of the ticket websites crashed and social media was full of praise for the “stress-free” and “surprisingly painless” online booking system.
