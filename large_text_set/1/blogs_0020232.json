Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nVoters go to the polls in 100 days to elect new mayors in England, but two of the biggest electoral battlegrounds have “significant” poverty, stubborn unemployment and falling wages. \nResearch by the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation has highlighted troubling underlying problems in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, with the poorest hardest hit. \nThe JRF says the new mayors must use their powerful new posts to create more and better jobs and the number one priority should be economic growth that benefits everyone. \nLabour’s former home secretary Andy Burnham is standing in Greater Manchester, and the former John Lewis store chief Andy Street is the Tory candidate in the West Midlands. Other hopefuls have yet to declare they are standing. Andy Burnham (pic: DM) \nThe study found that while both the West Midlands and Greater Manchester were performing well compared to other cities in business growth and job creation many people in the two regions were not reaping the benefits. \nIn Greater Manchester:- \n*Half a million people are income deprived - living below a reasonable standard of living -and one in four children grow up in poverty. \n*Since 2007 the employment rate has only just reached its pre-financial crisis peak at 70.5%. The unemployment rate has increased from 5.6 to 6.5%. \n*Average full time wages have fallen in real terms since 2007 from £527 to £494 per week. They are £50 per week below the national average of £545. \n*The bottom fifth of earners earn less than £346 per week - lower in real terms than £362 per week in 2007. \nIn the West Midlands:- \n*Almost 600,000 people are income deprived and three in ten children are growing up in poverty. \n*Since 2007 the employment rate has fallen from 66.3% to 64.5% and is 10 percentage points below the national average at 74%. *Unemployment is little changed, rising from 7.9% to 8.1. \n*Average full time wages have fallen in real terms from £517 to £497. \n*The bottom fifth of earners earn less than £345 per week – down in real terms from £353 in 2007. \nCampbell Robb, JRF chief executive, said:” Cities in the North and the Midlands have enjoyed a remarkable transformation over \nrecent years, powered by the engines of successful cities such as Manchester and Birmingham. \n“The West Midlands is one of the fastest growing areas of England and home to the country’s second city. Yet 600,000 people live in poverty in the region. \n“It’s clear something is not working, not least for the region’s nearby towns and cities where prosperity passed them by. The story is the same in too many places across the country. \n“It shows we cannot rely on thriving city centres alone to create growth and opportunity for city’s next-door neighbours. \n“For too long, we have too many people behind. We urgently need to rethink what economic growth looks like and who benefits from it, starting with our left behind towns and cities.” \nJRF will be urging the new ‘metro mayors’ to support workers in low-paid sectors, such as retail and hospitality, to improve their skills so they can progress onto better wages. \nThe ‘think-tank’ also wants mayors to use public sector contracts to provide apprenticeships and job opportunities to people in poorer areas, and encourage big local businesses to do the same.
