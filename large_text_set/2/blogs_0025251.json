It should never be available,\" said the treble winner on Sky Sports. \n\"In the last few days, a couple of players have spoken - and they are stitching themselves up, they are coming across as wholly dishonest. \n\"There are a couple more who I would like to hear from.

Even if they were asked, stay clear of it. \n\"The idea of sticking together, even if you're invited to comment, it is wrong and they will know it's wrong. \n\"I would like to think it hasn't happened. Seeing managers sacked is painful enough, if his own players have knifed him in the back, it is the most difficult part.\" Fans with a banner for former Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri (Photo: REUTERS) \nThe Foxes play their first game against Liverpool on Monday night since the Italian was let go. \nCaretaker boss Craig Shakespeare will oversee the fixture at the King Power Stadium. poll loading Should Leicester City appoint Roberto Mancini as manager? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T22:22:34.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
