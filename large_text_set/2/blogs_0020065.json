He’s going to go down in history as being roundly condemned for being the only politician to deliver on his promises.” \nEvans added that he’s seen “no evidence” that Trump is “racist” — which drew a number of gasps in the crowd — and that attacks on Trump are, in effect, attacks on “the American people.” \n“If they wanted more of the same or the ‘usual stuff,’ well that was on the ballot paper,” he said. “But they decided by the majority of states in the Electoral College, as it works, that they wanted Donald Trump.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:22:57.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
