The contracts can deliver tens of thousands of dollars for each speech — and hundreds of thousands for names like Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nMook, the 37-year-old who managed Clinton’s campaign, is a career field organizer, new to the world of speech and television contracts that have helped make well-paid public figures out of operatives fresh from campaigns or the White House.\nAfter his dismissal from the Trump campaign in June of 2016, Lewandowski, 43, signed on as a paid political analyst for CNN. The arrangement became subject to criticism when Lewandowski continued to advise Trump and once on-air revived the “birther” conspiracy that the president helped make prominent before his candidacy.\nLewandowski has since opened a Washington-based consulting firm with former Trump aide Barry Bennett.\nView this image ›\nLewandowski Getty Images\nID: 10392509 The Leading Authorities website says the two operatives will discuss such topics as “cyber attacks,” “unreliable polling,” and managing an organization “through crisis.”\n“Corey and Robby debate the day’s hot issues while sharing behind-the-scenes anecdotes from two of the most heavily-dissected campaigns ever run,” it says.\nAfter the election, the two operatives appeared together alongside other top Clinton and Trump aides at the Harvard Kennedy School’s quadrennial presidential campaign conference, an event that grew particularly tense and emotional during a three-hour panel discussion debriefing each team’s victories and missteps.\nThe Lewandowski-Mook arrangement is far from unusual.\nSpeaking agencies often advertise Republican-Democratic duos. Ahead of the 2012 race, the Harry Walker Agency once sponsored a popular joint booking with Karl Rove, the Republican strategist, and Robert Gibbs, the former press secretary to Barack Obama. (Leading Authorities also presents Lewandowski as a potential joint speaker with Democratic strategist and Obama alumna Stephanie Cutter.)\nLeading Authorities represents a range of public figures, from MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski to former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Democratic National Committee interim chair Donna Brazile.\nThe agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": ["http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/12/01/trump-hillary-aides-tussle-in-goddamn-foodfight-screaming-match.html", "https://www.leadingauthorities.com/speakers/corey-lewandowski-and-robby-mook", "https://www.leadingauthorities.com/speaker-list/political-speakers", "https://www.leadingauthorities.com/speakers/stephanie-cutter-corey-lewandowski"], "published": "2017-01-25T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T09:10:11.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
