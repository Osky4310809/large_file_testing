Read on to find out why, and catch up with more press conference quotes: Read the match report from Gander Green Lane \non his experience of Sutton… I come from a club that is smaller than that so it reminds me of my childhood. The changing rooms for me were fantastic – the closer you are, the more united you are when you go out there. When you are too far from each other in the dressing room with everybody having a chair, it is not so good. I prefer that – much more together. \non getting the job done… Yes, against a side that was astonishing. It is basically division five and they are 17th out of 24. I will never go down there [to manage] because it is too difficult! \non why Sutton surprised him… Yes, by the speed of their game, the fact they never stopped going until the end and compared to 20 years ago these teams are fit now and can play at the pace of the Premier League. Maybe [in the past] they collapsed in the last 20 minutes, that [era] is finished. \non an even game… They kept going and we were never really in a position where we could really afford to have a little breather in the game. We had to keep our focus, and I must give credit to my players who were professional and kept their focus, if we had come here in a relaxed mood we would have gone out tonight because Sutton produced quality. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:02:39.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
