Rob Bishop, R-Utah, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, put forth an industry-backed bill to kill the federal methane rule. During debate, committee members argued that only the Environmental Protection Agency and states have the power to regulate air pollution under the federal Clean Air Act. \nThe House is expected to vote on the issue Friday. The bill to kill the rule then would move to the Senate. \nHouse Republicans said industry methane emissions have decreased, even as production increased. They also argued that the rule would delay permits for companies seeking access to public land for drilling. \n“Congress has an obligation to ensure executive actions are consistent with congressional intent and that agencies operate in accordance with their statutory mandate,” Bishop said. “When they don’t — and in this case they haven’t — it is our responsibility to act.” \nFor years, oil and gas companies without systems in place to capture methane gas for sale or on-site use have disposed of methane by opening valves and venting it and by flaring. \nBLM data show that companies between 2009 and 2014 wasted enough gas to power 5.1 million homes for a year. That’s gas on which companies would have had to pay royalties to state, tribal and federal governments. \nCongressional Democrats, including Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, on Thursday sent Republican colleagues a letter calling the Congressional Review Act “an exceedingly blunt tool” for blocking what they see as “common-sense revisions” to out-of-date BLM rules. \nThe royalties lost from wasted methane “is millions of dollars that could go to state infrastructure needs, schools and emergency services,” the Democrats wrote. \n“Under the law, BLM has the obligation to conserve the oil and gas resource, prevent waste and ensure that taxpayers receive a fair return on production from federal leases.” \nOil and gas industry leaders applauded lawmakers’ attack on the rule. “As a land management agency, BLM lacks not only the statutory authority but the resources and expertise to regulate air quality,” said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Denver-based lobbying group Western Energy Alliance. “The Western Energy Alliance strongly supports use of the Congressional Review Act to roll back this clear overreach of federal authority in the form of a rule that will provide very little environmental benefit but at great cost.” \nThe WEA and the Independent Petroleum Association of America filed the lawsuit challenging the rule. Wyoming, North Dakota and Montana joined the lawsuit to block the rule from taking effect. \nBut U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl in Wyoming concluding that BLM officials do have the authority to regulate air pollution on public land, though his decision left open avenues for the industry to continue to fight the rule in court. Skavdahl set an expedited hearing schedule to resolve the issue. \nConservation groups strongly support the BLM air pollution rule.
