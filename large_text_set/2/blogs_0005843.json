Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi, the “keys to the club,” said ousted member Michael Javelos.\nStevo said many rank-and-file members were concerned that the club was being used to materially back a specific candidate, rather than the GOP nominee.\n“I was frustrated by how many people were ‘Never Trump’ on the board of the club,” he said. “The general membership was a different story. There were ardent Trump supporters.”\nChase said the purge was enabled by violations of the club’s bylaws, including failing to give 30 days’ written notice to members marked for removal.\nAt the end of the meeting, Javelos, Georgia Palmieri, Alain Palmieri, Stevo and Chase were removed from the committee. Georgia had been on the committee since 1998, she said.\nCoughlin did not return requests for comment.\n“The Met Club replaced its board members according to its bylaws. It was simply the replacing of the ‘old guard’ by younger blood, something that happens in any organization,” said club Chairwoman Adele Malpass. “This had absolutely nothing to do with Donald Trump.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:03:41.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
