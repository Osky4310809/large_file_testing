So after my shift ended sometimes I would go next door to the comedy club — still in the uniform but with a hoodie — and get on stage for just five minutes. I was awful.”\n“I think that working at Hooter’s influenced my voice as a comedian, as a woman. I was young there learning about my place in the world, learning about feminism,” she says.\n“The most attractive thing is not to be just soft and quiet and pretty decoration. That kind of gets boring quickly. The girls who had the most fun at Hooters and were funny and had the most friends were the ones who had some sense of humor about them — some wit — and who, like, cooperated with other women,” she says. “All of those things have really helped me in my career now.”\nKatherine Ryan: In Trouble is streaming now on Netflix.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:54:36.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
