Sad! \nAn unsolved mystery is plaguing the community of frozen-iced-coffee lovers from coast to coast: Dunkin' Donuts will no longer be serving its Coffee Coolatta. DD fanboys are asking: Why Dunkin'? Why? \nWhy would Dunkin' get rid of what appears to be a relatively popular drink? \nAccording to Business Insider , Dunkin' is taking an interesting approach to the announcement: \"Our Coffee Coolatta isn't good enough,\" Chris Fuqua, Dunkin' Donuts' senior vice president of brand marketing, said on Tuesday when the company announced that the Coolatta would be replaced by something called Frozen Dunkin' Coffee. The new drink will be made from coffee extract, sugar, and dairy and will be more of a riff on the chain's traditional iced coffee. \nIs it possible that a massive corporation is admitting that one of its products... sucks? \nExecutives at the announcement on Tuesday also said that the new Frozen Coffee was targeting \"a different type of customer than the Coolatta.\" Hmmmm. What the hell does that mean? \nMaybe the reason for the switch is that Dunkin' is feeling remorseful about how godawful the Coolatta is for you? The large mocha version has almost 1,000 calories and more than 130 grams of sugar. That's half-a-day's worth of calories and more than two times the amount of sugar most human beings should consume in a day. \nHold on—that can't be the reason either: The new Frozen Coffee is hardly better. The 32-ounce large contains 840 calories and 123 grams of sugar. And yes, there's a skim version—but that has 550 calories and, somehow, 125 grams of sugar! \nAnthony Bonitatibus, a brand marketing manager at Dunkin', said, \"We're always thinking about what is the next big thing in coffee, because we can't just rest on our laurels.\" \nMaybe the truth is that the Coolatta really wasn't that good. Twitter user @andrewjbeaton has a theory. He tweeted : \"Adieu, Coolatta. First sip was always delicious. 15th sip was always disgusting.\" \nNever willing to leave well enough alone, MUNCHIES decided to head off to the local Dunkin' in our unending thirst for the #Truth and see if the Coffee Coolatta is \"good enough\" for our editorial staff. \nMatt Zuras, Senior Editor: \"I'm neutral.\" \nHilary Pollack, Culture Editor: \"Tastes like depression.\" \nBecky Hughes, Intern: \"DESTROY IT. Wish it into the cornfield.\" \nSydney Mondry, Social Editor: \"Not good. It has a really gross aftertaste.\" \nBrad Cohen, Weekend Editor: \"I guess it's OK. It's not something I'd ever drink.\" \nMe: \"What I imagine liquified Werther's Caramel Coffee would taste like. Toss it.\" \nThe people have spoken. Maybe Dunkin' Donuts was on to something after all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:28:56.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
