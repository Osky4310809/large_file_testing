[China Daily] \nIf negotiations with the as yet unnamed airline succeed, it will be the first link between Birmingham and China since 2015, when a Chinese tour operator ran summer charter flights bringing holiday makers to the Midlands. \n\"Demand for flights to China from Birmingham is significant, driven mainly by the Midlands' strong trading relationship with China and we are in discussions with a carrier to reinstate services in the future following our successful Beijing operations in 2014 and 2015,\" a spokesperson for Birmingham Airport said. \nIn October, China and the UK's transport departments agreed to increase the maximum number of weekly flights between the two nations from 80 to 200. There are currently 38 flights a week operated by Chinese Airlines between both countries, while British airlines operate 29. The news was welcomed by industry players, however, it is challenging for UK airports that are not large transfer hubs to convince airlines to establish new long haul routes, according to Zheng Lei, director of the Centre for Aviation Research at the University of Surrey. \nZheng said: \"For airlines, the biggest concern is demand. The airport needs to convince the airline there is sufficient demand in the airport's catchment area. And it's very difficult to get enough traffic for long-haul flights on a daily basis, that's why they operate on hub networks. Airports such as Edinburgh, Birmingham and Manchester are not hubs, so it's very difficult to convince airlines to fly direct into their region. They have to rely on local traffic rather than transfers and the local market may not be big enough.\" \nTourism and transport officials in Edinburgh－in the top five urban centers in the UK visited by Chinese tourists－have officially lobbied for a direct link with China since 2015 when Marketing Edinburgh, the City of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Airport launched the Edinburgh China Air Link Project. Last week the project landed its first commercial sponsor, jeweler Laing Edinburgh. \nRob Laing, head of marketing at Edinburgh Airport, said: \"Private sector support shows the nature of the commitment the city has to a direct air route. Edinburgh is the second most popular destination with Chinese tourists, behind London, in the United Kingdom, and we want to make sure that any potential airlines appreciate the scale of the support the private sector will of er as well.\" \nA number of major airlines offer direct routes between London and China, including Virgin, British Airways, and Air China, while Hainan Airlines connects China and Manchester. In October 2016, British Airways terminated its direct route from London to Chengdu, stating it was no longer commercially viable. An end to financial support from Chengdu's local government and the absence of local affiliate airlines that were members of BA's alliance One world contributed to the cancellation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T17:38:21.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
