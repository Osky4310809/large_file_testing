Every night on tour, Adele reportedly climbs into a box on wheels and gets scooted past her fans by security guards, so she can effortlessly make her way to the stage without getting swamped by eager people in need of selfies and hugs. In a box. A box on wheels. The box, to be clear, is not one expressly made for this purpose. It’s usually a box for equipment, so it doesn’t have a big sign reading: “careful, Adele inside.” That means it’s fairly small. It’s also fairly sweaty, apparently, as during her performance at ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Adele casually mentioned that the way she gets to the stage makes her pretty moist. “How I get to this stage makes me so sweaty,” she said. “I’m drenched. I can’t tell you ’til the end. You’ll laugh when you find out.” After she made those comments, a mysterious insider told The Sun the truth: that Adele is transported to the stage via a box. They told The Sun : “Adele sits in the box for several minutes as she is taken from her dressing room right to the center of the crowd. Most of her fans are already seated and just presume it’s a piece of kit they are moving but some have been told by staff at venues that actually it’s their idol… sitting in a pretty small box a few feet from them.” Apparently Adele takes an iPad with her in the box to stay entertained. It's been revealed that #Adele sneaks into her concerts past unsuspecting fans by being wheeled to the stage in an equipment box pic.twitter.com/no2vQfeZkr \n— KiSS 92.5 (@KiSS925) March 13, 2017 \n  www.elle.com .
