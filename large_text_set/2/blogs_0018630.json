King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 9 hours ago 7 \nProducer David Bottrill, who was at the helm of production on staple Tool albums \" Aenima \" and \" Lateralus ,\" recently discussed the way that \"Aenima\" drum sound was attained, telling First Post : \n\"They wanted to explore a more original approach to their style of music than the standard LA metal production. \n\"When we did the tracking of the full band for 'Aenima,' we set up a PA behind the drums to originally put the electronic sounds out into the same room as the kit, because Danny played all his parts live with the kit and electronics. \n\"I then put the close microphones from all the drums into the PA as well and made a balance so as to give more power to the kit. It worked well and I am very happy with the drum sounds I achieved on that record.\" \nSharing another trick, David added: \"I like the processing of the percussion through some of my guitar pedals on that record and the triple amp guitar sounds. But I hope my best contribution was to encourage the band members to play to the top of their ability and improve over the duration of the record.\" \nAsked about the ongoing Tool rumors and reports, the producer replied: \"I don't really follow those. It's for the fans mostly. I know they love to mess with people and put out strange rumors. They all have a great sense of humor.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:48:44.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
