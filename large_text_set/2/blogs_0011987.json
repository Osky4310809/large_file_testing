The actress, making the rounds for her HBO mini-series Big Little Lies , is one of the lucky few starring in Star Wars: The Last Jedi . And though Corden tried his best, she's remaining tight-lipped about the movie (her role hasn't been announced). \n“I literally can say nothing, except...\" she started before saying the only things he could. \n“I was going to work, like any other job,” she told the audience while Corden's other guest, Zach Galifianakis, did hand gestures for her. “You know, going along. A small, independent movie, I get my wardrobe on, I learn my lines, I go to set, there’s a crew around, everybody’s lovely, people get their tea or their coffee… So, I then get to set and they roll the camera, and I look around and it’s Star Wars !” \nYup that's pretty much what we pictured. Coffee, tea and Jedis. See Dern's segment below.
