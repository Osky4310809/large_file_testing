When two Australian models and BFFs Georgia Gibbs and Kate Wasley posted a picture of themselves on Instagram, people assumed that Georgia, a size 6 model, edited her waist so she would look thinner next to Kate, another model who is a size 16. That is ~so~ not the case, though.\nGeorgia and Kate originally posted the photo to show their followers what a great time they were having together on the weekend. They’re smiling and embracing one another, and the happiness is almost contagious.\nWhere it all started ^ We posted this picture online, just as best friends going out on the weekend, it got reposted a lot and the controversy started.. You have photoshopped yourself thinner or your friend bigger, what kind of friend are you? Was one of the comments, it broke my heart because Kate and I are best friends why would I do that? The fact that a simple picture of two people together went so viral purely because of their body types shocked me... and @any.body_co was created because no one should have to deal with that and it shouldn't even be acknowledged, all I see here is two women.. not one \"skinny\" woman and one \"curvy\" woman, stop comparing everyone to each other and accept every person as beautiful in their own right. #loveanyBODY \nA post shared by Any Body (@any.body_co) on Mar 14, 2017 at 7:58am PDT \nHowever, there were some comments accusing Georgia of photoshopping her waist smaller , and needless to say, that was very hurtful for both of them to hear.\n“It broke my heart because Kate and I are best friends why would I do that? The fact that a simple picture of two people together went so viral purely because of their body types shocked me,” Georgia wrote. Instead of letting it get to them, though, Georgia and Kate created a separate Instagram account ( @any.body_co ) to honor the many different bodies women have around the world — and to prove that their bodies can be celebrated alongside each other, even though they don’t look the same.\nRules of friendship. Always be equally as sandy & laugh, a lot. ❤ #LoveAnyBODY #Quitthecomparisons \nA post shared by Any Body (@any.body_co) on Mar 20, 2017 at 8:57pm PDT \nThey’re using hashtags like #QuitTheComparisons, #LoveAnyBODY, and #StopBodyShaming. Georgia and Kate look stunning next to each other — it’s like they bring out each other’s beauty.\nStrong and not just physically. #LoveAnyBODY #Strongwomen #SelfLove @chrismohen \nA post shared by Any Body (@any.body_co) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:05pm PDT \nTheir new Insta account already has over 95,000 followers and their fanbase is growing quickly. Each picture is meant to be an affirmation that women can feel strong and sexy next to each other regardless of what size clothes they wear.\nWe feel like there's so many of you we know, so many messages about how you may have struggled with your appearance, pressure to be something you aren't and constant comparisons between you, your sisters or your friends and it brings us so much warmth that you feel okay so share those things with us Never stop messaging, if our little project can bring a smile to a few faces we'll be pretty stoked with that. You're beautiful. Love, @any.body_co ❤ #Thankyou #LoveAnyBODY #StopBodyShaming \nA post shared by Any Body (@any.body_co) on Mar 21, 2017 at 10:25am PDT \nIn their most recent post, Georgia and Kate said they’ve been receiving a lot of positive feedback about this new project of theirs.\n“ We feel like there’s so many of you we know, so many messages about how you may have struggled with your appearance…it brings us so much warmth that you feel okay so share those things with us,” they wrote. \nThey asked all their followers to keep writing messages, because it makes them so happy to know they’re bringing smiles to people’s faces. We certainly love what they’re doing, and we hope to see lots more from these two gorgeous, body positive models .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:47:43.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
