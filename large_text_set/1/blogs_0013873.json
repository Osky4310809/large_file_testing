Ringo H.w. Chiu / AP ID: 10339687 A former contestant on The Apprentice who alleges Donald Trump groped and forcibly kissed her at a hotel in 2007 filed a defamation lawsuit Tuesday, alleging the president-elect publicly disparaged her when he called her a liar.\nTrump called the allegations by Summer Zervos that he forced himself on her in Beverly Hills lies, and vowed to sue her and a dozen other women who came forward with allegations of misconduct during his campaign.\nSince he has been unwilling to retract his statements calling her a liar, or acknowledge that she was telling the truth, Zervos said she had no other choice but to file a lawsuit “in order to vindicate my reputation.”\nHer attorney, Gloria Allred, called the decision to sue brave.\n“She knows that she will be attacked by Donald Trump,” Allred said at a news conference in Los Angeles. “We’ve waited two months. Time is up.”\nSummer Zervos filed a defamation lawsuit today against President-elect Donald Trump @GloriaAllred announced\n— Claudia Rosenbaum (@CJRosenbaum) ID: 10339748 Zervos said she was “ambushed by Mr. Trump on more then one occasion” and that “he suddenly, and without her consent, kissed her on the mouth repeatedly: he touched her breast; and pressed his genitals up against her,” according to Zervos’ lawsuit filed in New York Tuesday. She said she pushed him away, told him his conduct was inappropriate but that he did not care. After Zervos came forward with her allegations, she said Trump lied calling them “made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED,” “100% fabricated and made-up charges,”and “made-up stories and lies.” She called Trump’s statements defamatory and that they caused serious harm.\nAt the press conference, Allred said Zevros would still drop her lawsuit if only Trump would issue an apology retraction.\nTrump’s treatment of women came under greater scrutiny during his campaign after the release of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape that recorded him bragging about kissing women, grabbing them “by the pussy,” and attempting to have sex with a married woman.\nTrump has denied all of the allegations made against him.\n1.\nMore Women Say Donald Trump Touched Them Inappropriately\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10339002", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/821446140784558080"], "published": "2017-01-18T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:23:33.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
