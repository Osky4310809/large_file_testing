And when the field lines up for the 59 th Daytona 500 on Feb. 26 (2 p.m. ET, FOX) Jimmie Johnson will enter the race with 80 wins, tops among active drivers But did you know there are 10 past Daytona winners who for their entire career never won more than 10 races? It’s true. And here they are. Getty Images Getty Images for NASCAR 10. Sterling Marlin, 10 Going into the 1994 Daytona 500, Marlin was winless in 278 Premier Series starts. He finally won at Daytona and then for good measure repeated in 1995 to win his second Daytona 500. No one else has gone back-to-back since. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 8. A.J. Foyt, 7 “Super Tex” only made 128 NASCAR starts, so to win seven races including the 1972 Daytona 500 in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Mercury isn’t bad. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 8.

Tiny Lund saw the inferno as he came through the infield tunnel. Lund stopped, got out and pulled in Panch out of the burning car. In gratitude, the Woods ask Lund to drive in the 500, which he went on to win. Lund is still the only driver to win NASCAR’s biggest race on a single set of tires.

Bayne’s victory, which came one day after he turned 20, is the first for the Wood Brothers in a decade. Neither Bayne, who now drives for Jack Roush, nor the Wood Brother,s have won since. © Nigel Kinrade 1240 Briers Creek Drive Alpharetta, Georgia 30004 Nigel Kinrade/Autostock 1.
