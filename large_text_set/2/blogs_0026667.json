Mine Is By Eric S. Jenkins, Associate Professor of Communication, University of Cincinnati As a professor of rhetoric, I am very concerned about the divisiveness in our political discourse. Pew research says Americans are more politically polarized than ever, and rhetoric full of name-calling and stereotypes of the other side obviously contributes to it. Surely, however, our Congressional representatives — who are charged with representing all of their constituents — are not to blame, right? Think again. Meet my representative from Ohio District 1, Steve Chabot. Chabot blogs weekly, and when I recently discovered his blog, I was appalled at the lack of dignity and professionalism, both thrown out in favor of divisiveness. His rhetoric received some attention because constituents saw an image posted on his blog from an anti-semitic website featuring code for white nationalists. Chabot removed the image and explained that it came from a google search, not the website. I give him the benefit of the doubt, especially because he has been a staunch defender of Israel. Yet take a look at an image he also posted, one he did not apologize for or remove. There is no other way to say this — this image is a stereotype, one designed to spread fear and division. Sure, some immigrants engage in gang activity, but by every measure they are a very small percentage. Yet Chabot associates all immigrants with gangs, and the gang signs and tattoos are designed to trigger subconscious racist biases. If we want to address gangs, let’s talk about policies to reduce them, not assert that immigrants are gang members. Unfortunately, such divisive and hateful rhetoric is the norm on Chabot’s blog, not the exception. He frequently posts images like this or says inflammatory things, like agreeing with Ben Carson that Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery! My research has led me to identify four characteristics of rhetoric that promotes divisiveness and polarization. Allow me to give examples of how Chabot uses each. First, polarization is fueled by rhetoric that groups people together, treating them as static entities. When we talk about “immigrants” or “the left” as some single thing, lots of individuals with diverse lives and opinions become unfairly grouped together. Chabot does this frequently with “the left,” but also does so with racial groups. For instance, he said, “Trump in appealing to African American voters has been making the case recently that … things are so bad under the Democrats that ‘what do you have to lose?’ He has a point.” Obviously, Chabot’s view of African Americans is one of extremely poor people, excluding many middle and upper class people. Second, polarization is fueled by rhetoric that otherizes people, treating “them” as not “us.” Otherization assigns negative characteristics to others, justifying hate from “us” to “them.” Obviously, the image above is designed to otherize, and Chabot frequently says things like “If you’re a social conservative in America, as I am, you hardly recognize the country,” while calling people on the left things like “zealots.” He even compared watching a democratic debate to passing kidney stones, saying “It was painful. What a bunch of lefists!” The way such otherization breeds divisiveness is evident when Chabot claims acknowledgment that black lives matter is “by implication” saying they matter “more than white lives.” Nobody says that, Mr. Chabot. You are spreading misleading information and divisiveness. Third, name-calling angers people, only furthering polarization. Chabot loves to call names. He says Obama was “the most divisive, the most vindictive” President. He called Colin Kaepernick a “punk.” He calls environmentalists “knee-jerk” radicals, and concludes the Keystone pipeline is a “no-brainer,” implying Obama is stupid. Oh how he loves the word stupid! He said, in response to Cincinnati becoming a sanctuary city, “It’s really stupid.” And after the tragic Orlando nightclub shooting, he took the time to throw punches, saying, “Of course there has been a knee-jerk call for more gun control… Some gay-rights activists are blaming the ‘Christian Right.’ Planned Parenthood blames “toxic masculinity” (whatever that means.) It’s hard to believe how stupid some of these people are.” Finally, polarization is fueled by refusal to listen and especially by rhetoric that dismisses counter-arguments. Take the last quote. Chabot dismisses “toxic masculinity” as a cause by mocking it — “whatever that means.” Well what it means, Mr. Chabot, is an identity discourse that bases masculinity on demeaning anything feminine or homosexual. So, the homophobic person who killed so many people in Orlando was very likely suffering from the effects of such toxic discourse. Your dismissal prevents you from understanding these problems in a more complex way. Another version of dismissal is called deflection, where someone diverts blame from themselves by projecting those problems onto opponents. My kids do this when they get in trouble, but you would expect more from adults, especially one charged with representing the great people of Cincinnati. Alas, this is not the case. Far too often, Chabot projects blame for something conservatives have done back onto the left. For instance, when many women came out accusing Trump of sexual assault, Chabot rushed to defend him. He said, “The thing that really bugs me is this. Even though Trump’s behavior with some, maybe many, women over the years has been boorish, and perhaps worse, it pales in comparison to Bill Clinton’s known behavior with respect to women.” This example is particularly egregious because Bill was not Trump’s opponent. Hillary was. A part of the reason Chabot can engage in such stereotyping, otherizing, name-calling, and dismissal is that his district is so gerrymandered. Although the city of Cincinnait consistently votes Democratic, the district is drawn to split the city in two and put us into a district with far away rural counties. In one of those counties, a constituent during the last election dumped a truck load of horse manure on Democratic Party headquarters, claiming it was “cheap advertisement.” If this act is a form of speech, then it is not the form that will reduce divisiveness in America. Unfortunately, I cannot get too angry at the person because his leaders model similar behavior. Chabot has not dumped manure, but his rhetoric is almost as vile and certainly well below the dignity and respectability we should demand from representatives. Such divisiveness is making America more hateful and less able to effectively govern. Thus I encourage all Americans, regardless of party, to get to know their representatives better and to speak out when you encounter such rhetoric.
