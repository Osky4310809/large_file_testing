Some very successful seasons. Unfortunately, regret we weren’t able to bring a championship to the Bay Area, which they so deserve. I think The Faithful has been great. Wish this organization nothing but the best moving forward. I do see a bright future for them.” \nBaalke was told Friday that he’d been fired, but he said attending today’s game “was the right thing to do.” \n“This is a class organization,” Baalke said. “You know, I’ve been here since 2005 and I have a lot of respect for the organization as a whole, and the ownership, the fan base. It’s difficult, but it’s the right thing to do.” \nBaalke isn’t alone: Head coach Chip Kelly will reportedly be fired after today’s game.
