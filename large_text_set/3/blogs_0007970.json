It had no away goals and needed a virtual miracle to have any chance of moving on to he final eight. \nWell, Barcelona got that miracle. \nOn Wednesday, Barcelona put together one of the more incredible displays we'll ever see in Champions League soccer. Barcelona cut into that 4-goal deficit early, but PSG - playing on the road at Camp Nou - seemingly ended the scare with a Edinson Cavani goal in the 62nd minute. With the aggregate at 5-3 and a PSG away goal, Barcelona needed three goals to move on. \nIt did just that. \nNeymar scored in the 88th minute on a brilliant set piece. Amazing to think #Neymar 's free-kick was in the 88th minute.I raised an eyebrow and went, 'Yeah but....' pic.twitter.com/eIZi8BLVZJ — Paul Morrissey (@Paul_Morrissey) March 8, 2017 \nMoments later, a foul set up a controversial penalty after Luis Suarez went down with little-to-no contact. PSG didn't know that they were going up against the best divers in the world...Neymar..Suarez Olympic divers pic.twitter.com/zBmUFo9yIU — Jeinny Lizarazo (@Jeinnylizarazo) March 8, 2017 \nNeymar converted on the penalty try to draw Barcelona level, but still needing another goal, Barcelona's Sergi Roberto found net in the final seconds. Neymar was MOTM. 2 goals and this brilliant assist and perfect flick by Roberto!! Amazing. just amazing pic.twitter.com/hWajLvXuOA — The Sports Deity™ (@DaSportsSavant) March 8, 2017 \nJust incredible. \nThis was as big of a collapse as you'll ever see in sports - on the same level as the Atlanta Falcons' Super Bowl meltdown. \nBarcelona was the first club to overcome a four-goal aggregate deficit in the Champions League, and now, it is moving on thanks to the remarkable 6-1 win.
