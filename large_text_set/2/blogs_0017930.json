The new app is specifically aimed at Indian users and offers a data-friendy Skype experience.\nSkype Lite is supposed to be fast, reliable as well as lightweight, as it’s only 13 MB in size. It allows you to check mobile and Wi-Fi data usage at all times and has a bunch of data saving features users will welcome with open arms. For example, the photos you share on Skype Lite get compressed before they are uploaded so that their size is reduced. And when you just forward a photo to someone, all the magic happens within the service, which means you don’t have to download the image and then uploaded it again to get the job done.\nSee also: Skype Preview for Android shows us a sleek interface and helpful features 6 days ago The app consumes less power and should run smoothly on low-end smartphones. It is available in seven different local languages: Gujarati, Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. The whole point of the newly released app is to reduce data consumption, which means that some features are missing. One of them is Mojis, the popular short video clips that can be used in instant messages.\nSkype Lite was developed in partnership with Microsoft India Development Center (IDC) and is designed especially for the Indian market. However, if successful, Microsoft just might expand it to other emerging markets around the world eventually.\nIf you want to try out Skype Lite, visit the Google Play Store by clicking the button below and download it to your device for free.\nDownload Skype Lite ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:44:12.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
