He’ll want more money than the Bears want to spend but Pace can’t afford to let him walk and then spend a high draft pick to replace him similar to what happened his first year with Brandon Marshall. \nEven with the 4-game suspension and otherwise subpar numbers this season, he has a lot of leverage over the Bears and even more so with there being no evidence so far that Kevin White will ever amount to anything. And the fact he was voted a captain tells you he has juice in the locker room as well. joefelicelli says: Jan 4, 2017 5:41 PM \nI would not give him anything close to the $14.9M per year he was slated to earn in 2016. I think his PED suspension and conservative offensive strategy ruined him as a #1. \nI would offer $10M per on a 4 year deal, with escalating guaranteed money on playing time and stats, and let someone else overpay. \nThe Bears are not going to get better on offense without major additions to their skill positions. Right now, the Bears have no receivers that are polished route runners. All of them are basketball players, so they need to add different types of players, either speed guys, or separation guys. Jeffery is the same as Meredith and White in that they don’t run great routes, and only White has speed (if he comes back 100% from the broken leg). They need at least one WR, and at least one TE, with or without Jeffery. If the Bears bring Cutler back, I would push harder to sign Jeffery. If they go with Hoyer and a rookie, no reason to bring him back. Hoyer won’t look for jump ball throws. He plays it too safe. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member?
