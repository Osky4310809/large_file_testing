( BBC Newsnight went so far as to report that the company was negotiating with Fisher’s estate for a similar deal.) But if those plans ever existed, they’ve now been destroyed, as surely as any giant, world-shattering superweapon being attacked by a plucky, ragtag force, or a well-trained army when confronted by a bunch of teddy bears armed with sticks. \n“Carrie Fisher was, is, and always will be a part of the Lucasfilm family,” the company’s statement continued. “She was our princess, our general, and more importantly, our friend. We are still hurting from her loss. We cherish her memory and legacy as Princess Leia, and will always strive to honor everything she gave to Star Wars.” Fisher will still appear in Star Wars: Episode VIII , in footage she filmed some time before her death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T03:34:56.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
