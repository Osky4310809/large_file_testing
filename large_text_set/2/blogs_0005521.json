Each sneaker comes resting atop a crisp white Boost sole and includes a white pull tab. Black plugs are incorporated at the rear, while the front tabs blend with the stretch mesh upper. No-nonsense and no surprises: just more NMD goodness.\nLook out for further information on these as it emerges. In the meantime, don’t sleep on this “ Solid Grey ” NMD_R1.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:51:07.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
