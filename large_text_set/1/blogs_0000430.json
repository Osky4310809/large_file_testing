Best of 2016 FOX Sports North's Photos of the Year \nThe teams traded baskets to begin the extra period before a Curry basket began an 11-0, victory-clinching run that snapped the Boilermakers’ seven-game winning streak. \nMinnesota (13-2, 1-1) overcame 28 points and 22 rebounds from Caleb Swanigan, but it wasn’t enough to save the Boilermakers (12-3, 1-1). \nSwanigan’s layup with 4.6 seconds remaining in regulation tied the game at 73 and forced overtime. Dupree McBrayer’s 3-point attempt for Minnesota at the buzzer bounced off the rim. \nThe Golden Gophers began the game by making their first eight shots and building a 17-4 lead, but Purdue rallied to lead 50-43 with 13:39 remaining. Mason scored 10 during the next three minutes, and it was back and forth the rest of the way. \nJordan Murphy added 16 points for Minnesota, which lost its Big Ten opener this past Tuesday night, 75-74 to Michigan State in overtime in Minneapolis. \nThe Golden Gophers had lost eight in a row at Purdue and had not won in Mackey Arena since Feb. 26, 2005.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T02:43:19.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
