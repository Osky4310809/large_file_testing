His amendment last year drew exceptionally wide cross-party and public support. Lord Dubs was himself a survivor of the Kindertransport efforts to save Jewish children fleeing the Nazis on the eve of the Second World War. \nThose efforts typified something of the best in us. A steadfast and quiet determination to protect children and the most vulnerable and to do so in time when the threat is urgent. \nSir Nicholas Winton always insisted that, when he cancelled his holiday plans to spend two weeks in Czechoslovakia to see the plight of refugees for himself, it was no great act of heroism. Nor did he think that his personal efforts to rescue 669 children, of whom Lord Dubs was one, as part of the 10,000 saved in total, were extraordinary. He believed that the spirit in which he acted was one shared by all of us, held in common. Both a profoundly human and a very British thing to do. \nIn a world where so many messages suggest that refugees in general are a threat, a burden or an embarrassment, it is something of a comfort to remember Winton. And it is shocking to see how far we are about to fall short of his achievement – that the government’s assessment of our entire country’s ability to help these children would fail to approach the accomplishment of one individual. \nNow, as we hear daily about children and young people disappearing as camps are closed and their populations shunted around, it is beyond dispute that the wellbeing of young refugees is more than ever at risk. \nIt is not too late. \nEach and every one of us can act in Nicky Winton’s tradition, whether by offering to foster a minor, by engaging our local council to encourage them to take in more children and see what can be done to assist them, by giving money to the Alf Dubs Children’s Fund or by calling your MP’s office and asking for action. \nTheresa May’s government has said that only 350 children can be helped by the brave Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act, claiming a lack of spaces available to local councils. The consultation that produced that number was threadbare and is now nine months out of date. We must call on government to re-consult those councils and do everything in our power to help town halls across the country welcome children in. \nIt was reassuring to know that the UK government was prepared to stand up for the rights and dignities of under-age refugees. I hope that we may yet have cause to be proud of our government’s refusal to ignore this pressing humanitarian crisis. I hope, along with many others, that the commitments given last year – and the people to whom those commitments were made – will not be betrayed. \nTo our government we say: think again. Honour your best instincts. \nDr Rowan Williams, master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, is the former archbishop of Canterbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:50:56.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
