She also took time to acknowledge her love for her fellow Young Money rapper right in the middle of the concert. ‚ÄúHe means the world to me, and I want you guys to know that,‚Äù she said, according to Uproxx . ‚ÄúI just want to beg you guys to chase your dreams. Don‚Äôt let anyone or anything get in your motherfucking way.‚Äù A post shared by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on Mar 12, 2017 at 5:25pm PDT \n‚Ä¶ And clearly, the love is mutual.
