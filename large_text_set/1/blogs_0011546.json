The 35-year-old man, who was a circus artist with 10 years of experience behind his back, died of his injuries two days after the attack. \nAlso in December, a drunk Russian man had both his arms severely bitten by a lioness after he entered the enclosure she was kept in a bizarre attempt at a cuddle. The man, in his 50s, who had been dismissed from his job as the zoo’s tractor driver two days prior to the mauling, climbed a high fence encircling the enclosure to find himself face to face with the lioness. The incident occurred in the early morning, when the zoo was still closed for the visitors. The zoo officials later argued that the animal was in no way to blame for the attack, stressing that all precaution safety measures were in place and one should know better than climb the fence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T04:31:31.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
