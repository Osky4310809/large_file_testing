Nikesh Pravin Savla saw an opportunity here, and started Taleho to help such people own or rent a property without any fear. \nNikesh says, “Expensive authentication processes, the lack of enough data points, complex end-to-end processes with no standard regulations, and a lack of transparency are some of the pitfalls of current solutions available in the market. \nAakash Bansal, Nikesh Savla, Anuj Sunil Gupta, and Sandip Chandran together founded Taleho in February 2015. It is a home search warranty company powered by an intelligent property match algorithm.

It provides a dedicated property assistant with one year of support and maintenance cover.

The company believes that In India, house hunting is the biggest hunt.
