After The History Boys , Corden co-wrote and starred in the critically acclaimed Gavin & Stacey , before ending up with his own nightly US talk-show, on which he drives some of the most famous people in the world around in his car while singing at them. Obviously.\nID: 10747574 2. Russell Tovey as Rudge. Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock\nJohn Phillips / Getty Images\n Now: Since The History Boys , Tovey’s face has been almost as common a sight on our screens as James Corden’s. He took a lead role in the BBC shows Being Human and Him & Her , appeared alongside David Tennant and Kylie Minogue (!!!) in Doctor Who , and is currently starring in ABC’s thriller, Quantico . Later this year Tovey will return to the National Theatre (home to The History Boys during its West End run), appearing in Angels in America with Andrew Garfield.\nID: 10747634 3. Samuel Anderson as Crowther. Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock\nDaniel Leal-Olivas/PA Archive/PA Images\n Now: Like Tovey, Anderson made the leap from boys’ grammar school to TARDIS, appearing as Clara Oswald’s (ultimately doomed) boyfriend, Danny Pink, in Doctor Who . He also starred in Emmerdale for two years, and can currently be seen in Sky 1’s supermarket-based comedy, Trollied .\nID: 10747681 4. Andrew Knott as Lockwood. Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock\nBBC\n Now: Knott made his breakthrough over a decade before The History Boys , playing nature-loving Dickon in The Secret Garden . More recently he’s appeared in Casualty (above), Black Mirror , Waterloo Road , and E4’s Banana . Knott also starred alongside fellow History Boys Russell Tovey and Samuel Anderson as friends of Smithy and Gavin in Corden’s Gavin & Stacey . Just like old times!\nID: 10747995 5. Dominic Cooper as Dakin. Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock\nCHRIS J RATCLIFFE / Getty Images\n Now: Dominic Cooper is further proof that Alan Bennett et al. really did have the Midas touch when it came to casting The History Boys . Since then, Cooper showed he can sing and dance to ’70s pop classics in Mamma Mia! , took on a massive action-fantasy franchise in Duncan Jones’ Warcraft , and now he’s landed the lead role in hit AMC show Preacher .\nID: 10748041 6. Samuel Barnett as Posner. Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock\nTristan Fewings / Getty Images\n Now: Since leaving the shy, sensitive, and heartbroken Posner behind him, Barnett has been rather busy. Recently he landed the title role in a BBC America’s adaptation of Douglas Adams’ Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency . Before that he appeared in the BBC’s critically acclaimed Twenty Twelve and Showtime’s Penny Dreadful . Unlike some other History Boys alumni, Barnett has continued to consistently ply his trade on stage – including significant stints in Richard III and Twelfth Night . Hector would be proud.\nID: 10748100 7. Jamie Parker as Scripps. Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock\nManuel Harlan\n Now: On TV, Parker has appeared in shows such as Silent Witness and Endeavour , and on stage he’s played Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls and the title role in Henry V . But you probably don’t want to talk about that, because yes, that IS a lightning scar on his forehead, which can mean only one thing: Jamie Parker is Harry Potter. Since it premiered in 2016, Parker has played the lead role in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , which further proves my theory that The History Boys are slowly but surely taking over the world…\nID: 10750251 8. Sacha Dhawan as Akthar. Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock\nJeff Spicer / Getty Images\n Now: Again, Dhawan has seemingly managed to appear in more or less everything since moving on from The History Boys , including – but certainly not limited to – 24 , Mr Selfridge , Sherlock , Last Tango in Halifax , and Line of Duty . Arguably his most high-profile role to date, however, is his most recent one – he can currently be seen playing Davos in Netflix’s much-talked-about Marvel’s Iron Fist .\nID: 10750376 “Pass it on, boys.
