(Each Kortex comes with a free copy of the first-person game Land’s End .) After 10 minutes of stimulation, you’ll feel more relaxed as a result of neurotransmitter production, Fisher Wallace says. The company recommends using the Kortex once or twice a day for 20 minutes. Want to give it a try? The Kortex will ship to Indiegogo backers starting at $299 in July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:02:08.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
