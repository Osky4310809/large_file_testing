ET's Lauren Zima sat down with Bachelorette villain Chad Johnson (aka \"Bad Chad\") for a Facebook Live interview on Monday, where he revealed that he's \"interested\" in the 24-year-old Miami native -- and that the two have already been \"texting.\" \"Yeah [I'm interested in Corinne],\" Johnson confessed. \"I mean, I don't know what she's like in person, but… we've texted a little bit.\" It seems the pair's villainous streaks have brought them together. \"I knew that because she was the villain, nobody was really going to be talking to her. She was probably going through this all alone, and you think no matter how hard-headed you are… I knew people were probably just tearing her down, so I just wanted to let her know, like, 'Try not to look at it, let it pass. It will slow down,'\" he said. \"She's good [now]. I think at first, she had the same emotion as me. She was like, 'No, I'm good. I got this,' and then a couple weeks down the line, I think she texted me like, 'This is getting kind of tough,'\" he added. \"But yeah, she seems pretty cool… she obviously doesn't care at all what anybody thinks.\" EXCLUSIVE: 'Bachelor' Nick Viall Finally Meets Corinne Olympios' Nanny, Raquel -- Watch! For Bad Chad, Olympios is the only reason to watch Viall's season of The Bachelor. \n\"To be honest, when I watch the show, I don't watch it. It's super boring. I hated watching it. The only reason I wanted to watch it is to see what chicks I want to date,\" he revealed, adding that he'd be open to being the Bachelor himself. \n\"It is a great opportunity,\" he said. \"I think the one thing people would see with me is my ability to read through people and know which girl just wants to pawn teeth whitener, and which girl actually likes me.\" Needless to say, Johnson is definitely looking forward to meeting Olympios on Bachelor in Paradise next summer, telling ET that's he's \"already agreed to do it.\" \"That's the plan,\" he said, adding that this time, he's going in with a different perspective. WATCH: Chad Johnson Makes a Messy 'Bachelor in Paradise' Debut: Drinking, Name Calling and Eventually Soiling Himself \n\"[I'd want to] have fun, but not too much fun,\" he said. \"Try not to black out, try not to get kicked off. Do not scream at Chris Harrison, [and] watch out for the crabs. And actually try to get on a date with the girls I am interested in.\" \n\"I have only drank twice this year… I don't want to do the blacking out thing anymore. [My] real estate career is tanked, it's gone. I guess people thought I was murder-y,\" he shared, referencing the many threats he made (jokingly?) about murdering fellow Bachelorette contestants and their families during his run on the show. \"At first [being the villain] was fun, but I’m telling you, having to explain yourself every day gets old,\" he described. Johnson also harbors a few regrets about the behavior that's a little harder to explain -- namely his mean-spirited comments towards Sarah Herron. Chad Johnson and Sarah Herron Come Face to Face on 'Bachelor in Paradise: After Paradise' \"Obviously [I regret] the Sarah thing,\" he admitted. \"When I was watching it, that's the one thing I remember I sat down, and I was like, 'Well thank god I didn't say anything about that.' That was a surprise to me…. I messed up on a few things. I was going through a hard part of my life, and I think my kind of way of covering my troubles is joking, and especially once I start drinking, it kind of takes over, so I sometimes say the wrong things.\" EXCLUSIVE: 'Bachelorette' Villain Chad Johnson Feels Misunderstood, Talks Possibility of a Spinoff Show But his experiences on Paradise haven't deterred the Oklahoma native from giving TV love another shot. In fact, he says it's the only way to find someone who \"understands that world\" -- plus, he's \"already kind of dated most of the hotties\" in Oklahoma. \"At this point, it's become such a part of my life that it's like, I need someone who understands that stuff. And I feel like people in the general world don't really like get the stuff that I have to deal with now,\" he said. \"They kind of understand that world and how to operate and live in it.\" As for how Johnson is prepping for his Paradise return? Well, that would naturally include a little lunch meat and weight lifting; in fact, Johnson says he's channeled his interests into starting a diet and fitness plan for women at his website, RealChadJohnson.com . \"90 percent of the people who follow me online are women, so I figured, might as well help them,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:08:54.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
