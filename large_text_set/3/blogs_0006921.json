The platform enables users to create public and private groups where users can share photos and videos that stay around for three days before vanishing into digital pixel-dust. \n“We originally created a Snapchat group for our college,” says Kristoffer Lande, Gobi’s CEO. “And the group rapidly grew to 4,000 users. Snapchat wasn’t a big fan, so they shut it down after about 24 hours. Everybody loved the community group, however, so we decided to build our own app.” \nOne of the uses for the app is to ask for opinions; whether someone thinks your shoes are hot or not, or whether you should buy a particular shade of sunglasses. \n“Gobi is designed to put interactivity at your fingertips,” says Lars Erik Fagernæs, the company’s CTO. “We learned that our users often ask for each other’s opinions in the app. Gobi now solves this by letting them do it with one simple step. The interactive stickers can be added on top of the snaps, and then the viewers will be able to tap and interact with them.” By placing an interactive sticker on your photo, you can get instant feedback from your followers. \nThe interactions vary from simple up or down votes to links, embedded videos, audio tracks and much more.
