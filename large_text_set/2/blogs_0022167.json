Source: Getty Images \nThe Adelaide Strikers coach cannot see Australia making any changes from the XI that won so comprehensively in Pune, but believes Maxwell is worth looking at. \nThe all-rounder, who has not played a Test since 2014, has a healthy first-class average of 39.60 and is highly rated in India due to his ability to take the attack to the spinners. \n“(Mitchell Marsh has) probably done enough to hang on but if they feel they can get away with two seamers I’d be tempted to potentially play someone like Glenn Maxwell who is a fine player of spin. I think he’s an underrated long form player. \n“I think on these surfaces he can be quite fearless and take the attack to the Indian spinners.” \nMarsh did not bowl a single over in Pune but with Bangalore’s pitch expected to be a far more traditional Indian wicket – favouring the batsmen over the first three days before breaking up – Gillespie does not believe Australia will risk dropping the seam-bowling all-rounder. \nGillespie was a part of the Australian squad that last won a series in India in 2004. Just like the current series, the Australians won their first match of that tour and the 41-year-old is confident Smith’s outfit are good enough to capitalise on the same opening. \n“India have to make the play here, and they have to go out and take some risks and be ultra-positive. Australia just need to play and take the games deep. \n“The simpler the Australian boys keep it and the longer the games go, the Indians will start to panic a little bit, and they’ll start to try to create things when they’re not there and that’s where their mistakes will come in. \n“If we just stick to our disciplines and stick to our patience, follow that process we’ll be well in the game.” Kohli plays costly leave 0:31 \nSteve O’Keefe made the most of an old fashioned Bunsen burner in game one, finishing with match-figures of 12-70, orchestrating a stunning first-innings collapse that saw the Indians lose seven wickets for 11 runs. O’Keefe’s figures were the 11th best of any Test bowler in India and the best ever by a touring spinner. They were also 10th best by an Australian anywhere. \nDespite this, Aussie provocateur Harbhajan Singh remains unconvinced of the left-arm finger spinner’s quality. \n“I will have to see him bowl on a good Test match wicket. Not this one. Till then, I will reserve my comments,” Harbhajan told the Indian Express. \nVirat Kohli was similarly dismissive of O’Keefe’s performance, pinning the humiliating loss on India’s batting and not Australia’s bowling. \n“If you don’t apply yourself, any bowling attack can look dangerous,” Kohli quipped, when asked about O’Keefe’s 12-wicket match haul. \nBut Gillespie is confident O’Keefe is capable of causing India’s batsmen trouble on flatter tracks than the one dished up in Pune. \n“He’s consistently hitting a spot on the pitch which is challenging the batsman to make a decision,” he said. \n“He always keeps the stumps in the game, that’s the thing with Steve O’Keefe, he keeps the stumps in play at all time.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:19:06.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
