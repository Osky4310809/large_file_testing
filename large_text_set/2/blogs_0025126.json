Each working group had at least one cabinet-level official serving as a sort of moderator while the group chewed over ideas and aides sitting along the walls took notes. \nVice President Mike Pence, joined by Kushner, floated from room to room, dropping in to deliver brief remarks before moving along to the next. \nIn the infrastructure meeting, overseen by Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, Pence dropped in to call for \"innovative\" financing efforts to jumpstart infrastructure projects, and one administration official praised Canada's revamping of its air traffic control system, citing it as an example of the kind of public-private partnerships the administration hopes to see undertaken here. \nWhen Pence entered the room and worked his way around the table shaking hands, he pointed to Cohn and joked, \"We all work for him.\" By Darius Tahir \nIn the Workforce of the Future group, Ivanka Trump, Commerce Secretary-designee Wilbur Ross and Small Business Administration chief Linda McMahon facilitated the conversation, in which one CEO talked about the necessity of making manufacturing jobs more attractive to young people. Multiple people in the room praised European-style apprenticeship programs. \nIn the Tax and Trade group, Peter Navarro and Treasury Sect. Steven Mnuchin oversaw the meeting where multiple CEOs praised Germany for its robust manufacturing sector that coexists with high wages. \nOMB director Mick Mulvaney oversaw the regulatory reform meeting, jotting down notes as one CEO complained about regulatory uncertainty and austere portraits gazed down on the group. \nIn his remarks in at least two of the meetings, Pence commented that he and Kushner believe it’s in small groups where work really gets done. \nIn the White House meeting afterward, one CEO from each of the four groups was to report out on the sessions.
