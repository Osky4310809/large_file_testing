The hypothetical building ‚Äî dubbed ‚ÄúBig Bend‚Äù ‚Äî looks like two 432 Park Avenues joined together at the top in a curve. If built, it would also be the longest skyscraper in the world.\nOnline reactions to the proposal have been, well, mixed.\n@CBSNews That's awesome, but can we afford it? Another monument to our greatness need to be on hold. #QualityOfLife is of greater concern üè•üè°\n‚Äî Joe Marks (@Bruinsbegonias) March 24, 2017 \n@CNN what kind of genius thought up that rubbish or are you planning to fly a plane through it\n‚Äî james mitchell (@jimmymitch82) March 24, 2017 \n@cnni Reminds me of a paper clip. I wanna see it built just off the memes it'll produce.\n‚Äî Juanito (@TaperNoFade) March 24, 2017 \n\nBut don‚Äôt get too riled up: It would take a miracle for this bendy building to rise in NYC. That‚Äôs not necessarily because it‚Äôs structurally impossible ‚Äî the firm‚Äôs architect, Ioannis Oikonomou, thinks it‚Äôs an ‚Äúachievable scenario.‚Äù Instead, you can blame (or thank) the city‚Äôs strict zoning laws for keeping this off the skyline.\nStill, Oiio dares to dream of a time when the arch could rise. ‚ÄúThe Big Bend can become a modest architectural solution to the height limitations of Manhattan,‚Äù the firm wrote in a statement. ‚ÄúWe can now provide our structures with the measurements that will make them stand out without worrying about the limits of the sky.‚Äù\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:59:41.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
