Only mothers in Ireland and Slovakia have worse entitlement. \nUnder UK law, women can take a year of maternity leave and will get paid for 39 weeks of that. Women on maternity leave face 'reduced hours and being made redundant' \nThe first six weeks is compensated at 90 per cent of their salary, but it then drops dramatically to just under £140 per week, which is below the national minimum wage , according to the TUC. \n“Lots of parents here are forced back to work early to pay the bills,” said TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady. \n“The UK is in the relegation zone when it comes to decently-paid maternity leave.” \nMothers in Croatia are entitled to six months of what the TUC considers decently-paid maternity leave, making them the most favourable country for parental benefits, followed closely by those in Hungary who can claim just over five and a half months.
