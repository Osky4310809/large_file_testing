In a second tweet Sunday evening, he complained again about the courts: Tweet from @realDonaldTrump \nIn normal situations, a president with a deep concern or some kind of intelligence about a pending attack would turn to the appropriate law enforcement agencies and his military advisers. But what Trump’s tweets likely reveal instead is an unwillingness to respect the opinions of the two other branches of government—something known as checks and balances. \nIn an emergency appeal of Robart’s ruling to the Ninth Circuit early Sunday morning— which the Trump administration also lost —Acting Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued that the decision was an “impermissible intrusion on the political branches’ plenary constitutional authority over foreign affairs, national security, and immigration.” \nIn other words, do as I say, or else.
