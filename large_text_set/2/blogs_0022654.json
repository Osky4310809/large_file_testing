She keeps asking me questions about it. She absorbs everything she sees and hears, you see\". \nThe woman's daughter has significant health problems and is regularly in and out of hospital. \nShe suffers from mild scoliosis and Goldenhar Syndrome. \n\"This just isn't on. A little innocent girl should not have to go through that. How would this have been allowed to happen? \n\"The woman was threatening the nurses and shouting on the phone about shooting up and buying more gear. My daughter was terrified,\" she added. \nWhile the woman accepted that overcrowding issues are affecting hospitals all over Ireland, she says there can be \"no excuses\" for what happened. \nIn a statement to Independent.ie, Portiuncula University Hospital said: \n\"There was a delay in transferring a child to the ward due to an emergency in the Paediatric Ward. The child was cared for in \"minors area\" in the Emergency Department, which is a two bedded area, as the paediatric room was occupied due to the volume of children attending the department. \n\"The nurse in charge apologised on the day to the child and the child's family for the distress they suffered. We are working with the staff in both paediatrics and the Emergency Department to ensure this does not occur again. \n\"Portiuncula University Hospital apologies for any distress caused.\" \nThis week it was revealed how around 90 beds were lying idle in hospitals across the country yesterday as the trolley crisis forced hundreds of patients to endure more gruelling delays in emergency departments. \nHealth Minister Simon Harris disclosed the number of closed beds - due to lack of staff - at the Oireachtas Health Committee, where he was tackled on the failures of the health service, including the suffering of patients on waiting lists. \nHe was speaking as 516 patients were on trolleys, including 45 in Cork University Hospital. \nHSE chief Tony O'Brien said he acknowledged the \"distress for patients and their families, and the impact on staff caused by overcrowded emergency departments\". \nMr O'Brien also said that the number of delayed discharges - patients who no longer need hospital care but need suitable step-down care - had reduced from 619 to 436 over the winter.
