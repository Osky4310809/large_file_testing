Whether they’re wearing the crushed velvet leggings of our dreams, or the fluffy coat we can only lust over, there are some seriously stylish children out there. The ever growing list also includes 4-year-old Marion, whose recent rise to sartorial fame came at the expense of her father, Robert Kelly, who was interrupted by stylish Marion during a live video call with BBC. The interview went viral, creating a wake of Youtube fame for Robert, Marion, Marion’s little brother James, and their mom Kim.\nAnd although there’s a lot to love about the video, like James rolling in and Kim expertly whisking her kids out of the video, we would argue that Marion’s presence takes the cake. Although she may only be four, she’s already on track to be a style icon. Clad in the sweetest pink glasses and yellow jumper, Marion’s outfit is fun! But she really proved her style at a BBC press conference, where her khaki trench coat, pink glasses and stern but adorable face stole the show.\ndoes anyone know where to cop the toddler from the bbc dad video's glasses? pic.twitter.com/v6id73xGBz \n— Gabby Noone (@twelveoclocke) March 15, 2017 Since we don’t discriminate on what age we can “steal your style” at, we’ve done the dirty work and found some staples that will help you emulate the sweet look of Marion. If there’s anything this babe has proved is that there is no age limit on style, and pink glasses are definitely going to be in this season.\nSteal her style: Marion edition Nordstrom Rack Saint Laurent glasses, $129.97 \nNordstrom Rack Fendi glasses, $119.97 \nKohls Peter Pan collar shirt, $14.40 \nOrchard Mile Plaid dress, $148.50 \nSheIn White long sleeve, $9 \nNordstrom Topshop trench coat, $110 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:41:04.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
