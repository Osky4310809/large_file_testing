Philstar.com/Bing Maps \nZAMBOANGA CITY — Troops recovered an assault rifle, a hundred rounds of ammunition and other battle equipment of the Abu Sayyaf group while pursuing the militants in the jungle of Sulu on Thursday. \nCapt. Jo-Ann Petinglay, spokesperson of Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom), said the soldiers under the 16th Infantry Battalion were conducting a clearing operation when they discovered M16-A1 rifle, eight magazines with 123 rounds of ammunition, two jungle hammocks, a pair of combat boots, and a bandoleer in Barangay Paligi, Indanan town about 9:30 a.m. \nPetinglay said the troops initially encountered the Abu Sayyaf group led by Aldin Bagadi on Wednesday in the same area. The clash left an undetermined number of militants killed and wounded. \nThe troops continued their operations in the area and stumbled upon the weapons and other war materials concealed in the bushes, she said. \nMaj. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., Westmincom chief, said the Abu Sayyaf bandits were hiding their firearms and other battle attires to blend with civilians, avoid detection and escape the military pursuit. \n\"The recent seizure only proves that the Abu Sayyaf members are hiding their armaments because their corridors have already been narrowed. They are guising as civilians to evade government forces and civilians who report their whereabouts,\" Galvez said.
