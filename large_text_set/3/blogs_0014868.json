The Citizens Advice “Martin Lewis” Fund is up and running March 20, 2017 51 Views \nLast year I blogged that as part of my ongoing giving strategy I made a donation to support the superb work of Citizens Advice. The charity decided to use the money to set up the ‘Martin Lewis innovation fund’ (its name not mine). \nWell I’m delighted to say that launched today, so rather than me regurgitating, here’s their press release… Citizens Advice services share £625,000 through Martin Lewis Fund Citizens Advice services across England and Wales are today celebrating sharing £625,000 from the Martin Lewis Fund to help make a real difference to local people’s lives. \nAwards of £25,000 are being given to 25 local Citizens Advice services to deliver projects that will provide more support to particular groups of people and help them in new and inventive ways. \nLocal Citizens Advice will be able to share their learning and potentially encourage others to launch similar projects so that more clients across England and Wales benefit. \nProjects include: \nCitizens Advice Elmbridge West: Will train volunteers to provide longer term support for people who have experienced domestic abuse and additional problems they may face such as housing and finance to help them towards independence. \nCitizens Advice Denbighshire: Will engage mothers and families in need of support by working with their local health visitor and midwifery team to deliver early advice on problems such as debt, benefits and managing finances which will in turn improve their health. \nCitizens Advice South Sandwell: Will promote and deliver advice services to people who do not have English as their first language and are not currently served by interpreting services locally by using a digital translation platform, trained volunteers and staff. Gillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, said: \n“We are delighted to be able to announce this funding to 25 Citizens Advice services. The funding will give them a chance to build on what they have already achieved with their pilot projects. Not only will the funding help local people to solve their problems, but the local services will capture what works well and share their learning so that other people across England and Wales may also benefit. We’re very grateful to Martin Lewis for his ongoing support.” \nMartin Lewis said: \n“Few realise Citizens Advice, which is at the bedrock of British society, is a charity not a government agency – a shame as the work it does is truly life saving. I’ve met many people who were suicidal over legal or money life challenges they couldn’t cope with, yet a visit to their local Citizens Advice put them on the path to dealing with it. As a huge fan of the organisation, I wanted to do something to help it pioneer new ways to reach out and improve people’s lives, and I’m excited to see where this takes us.” \nThe awards announced today follow an initial award of £1,000 in September 2015 to test initial project ideas. The funding comes from a £1 million donation from Martin Lewis to Citizens Advice across the UK in 2015. \nProjects had to fit into categories including making people more digitally skilled, working closely with health and social care providers, and future opportunities for volunteers. \nThe 25 Citizens Advice services are: \nCitizens Advice Braintree, Halstead and Witham Citizens Advice Bury District Citizens Advice Central and East Northamptonshire Citizens Advice Denbighshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T12:42:08.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
