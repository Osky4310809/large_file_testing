Henderson/Getty Images Adam Wells Featured Columnist March 24, 2017 Before Monday's vote by NFL owners to determine if the Oakland Raiders will receive approval to relocate to Las Vegas, Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf is making a late plea to the league to keep the franchise in the Bay Area. Scott Bair of CSN California posted the letter Schaaf sent to the NFL about the Raiders: Scott Bair @BairCSN 3/24/2017, 6:14:36 PM Schaaf highlighted plans to \"develop a fully financed local stadium proposal\" for the team. She also cited the Bay Area's size as the \"sixth-largest media market\" in the country, compared to 40th for Las Vegas, and saving between $600-700 million on an open-air stadium as opposed to what building a new stadium in Vegas would cost. Schaaf concluded the letter with a request to the NFL that Oakland be given \"the consideration it deserves and help bring the Raiders back to the negotiating table.\" The NFL is holding its annual league meeting from March 26-29 in Arizona . Owners, coaches and general managers will gather to discuss multiple issues, including various rule changes and a centralized replay system. The Raiders' future figures to be the dominant topic of conversation. The team will need 75 percent approval from the NFL's 32 owners in order to relocate, which NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported is a likely outcome at some point soon: \nAccording to several sources informed of their situation, the outlook is positive that the team will get the OK to move -- either next week or at the Spring League Meeting in May. The Raiders will make a presentation, briefly touching on Oakland but mainly selling their vision to the league. The league would also present, then there would be a question-and-answer period. If all goes well, there would be a vote. Albert Breer of The MMQB reported the Raiders' relocation fee will be between $325 and $375 million, which is approximately half of what the Chargers and Rams were each charged ($650 million) in their separate moves to Los Angeles. ESPN's Paul Gutierrez reported two weeks ago the Raiders secured remaining financing from Bank of America to build a new $1.9 billion stadium in Las Vegas. Las Vegas Sands Corporation chairman Sheldon Adelson previously backed out of a commitment to help finance the new stadium. If the Raiders are approved for a move to Las Vegas, they would play the next two seasons in Oakland before leaving the city. The Raiders are in their second stint in Oakland, moving back to the city in 1995 after spending the previous 13 years in Los Angeles. The franchise is coming off its most successful season in 2016 since 2002, going 12-4 before losing to the Houston Texans in the AFC Wild Card Round.
