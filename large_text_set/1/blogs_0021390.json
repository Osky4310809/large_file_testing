She was suspended indefinitely and later tweeted an apology. \n“People don’t have the same filter that they would have if they were speaking face-to-face,” Goldman says. \nOf course, people saying mean things about the children of presidents is nothing new. \nBoth Sasha and Malia Obama found themselves targets of ugly remarks, as did Chelsea Clinton. \nBut Goldman says with social media the ugly messages are carried much faster and farther than ever before. \n“These days, it can reach thousands and millions of people within seconds because it’s re-tweeted or sent around,” she says. \nChelsea Clinton took to Facebook to defend Barron, saying in part, “Barron Trump deserves the chance every child does — to be a kid.” Mai Martinez facebook Follow Mai Martinez co-anchors CBS 2 Chicago’s weekend evening newscasts and serves as general assignment reporter during the week.
