It’s the big ones that do. Why are we stopping the small ones? We should be stopping the big ones,” he said in a The Star report. \nA meeting between ministries will be held to further discuss this issue. “We need to know who the biggest emitters are. Are they lorries, buses, cars or motorcycles? For motorcycles, I don’t know because to me, it should be the big lorries that shouldn’t be allowed in,” said Wan Junaidi. \nSaying that a complete ban is unfeasible, Wan Junaidi held the city of London up as an example, where residents were encouraged to utilise public transport by making it difficult to drive cars in the city. While agreeing in principle that cutting carbon emissions by reducing dependance on private transport is the way forward, proper research is required before implementing such a move. \nThe Transport ministry has also come out against Tengku Adnan’s suggestion to ban kapchais , with Deputy Transport minister Datuk Ab Aziz Kaprawi saying most kapchai riders are low-income earners, and such a ban would only be feasible if there are convenient alternate transport options.

His weapon of choice is the Desmoquattro engine, and he has a penchant for anything with a dash of Italian design. Strangely enough, he insists he's a slow rider.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T12:19:15.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
