There’s such thing as the exhaustion of administrative remedies. I will not judge her now.” \nDuterte’s statement came after the Chamber of Mines filed a complaint to oppose Lopez’s confirmation at the CA. \nThe Palace earlier said the complaining parties should just file an appeal before the necessary agencies, including the Office of the President.
