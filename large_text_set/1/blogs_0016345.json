But he weighed in on 2018, when Pennsylvania's two top Democrats, Gov. Tom Wolf and Sen. Bob Casey, are up for reelection. \nKenney thinks Wolf, who's already drawn a challenger in GOP state Rep. Scott Wagner, is in more trouble than Casey. “I think he’s gonna have a tough race, because Wagner’s got a lot of money and he’s crazy,\" he said. \nThe mayor said he loves Wolf but questioned his political instincts, especially a recent decision to deny a raft of applications for tax breaks administered by the state's economic development programs. \"From a philosophical business perspective, he doesn’t think the government should be doing something like that,\" Kenney said. \"There were 21 of them across the state and he denied all of them. And I said to him, ‘Don’t you want to cut a ribbon? Don’t you want to turn a shovel of dirt?” \nStill, Kenney said he's optimistic that Democrats will do better in Pennsylvania next year than they did in 2016, when GOP Sen. Pat Toomey and Trump both eked out surprise victories in races where Democrats were favored. \nJohn Fetterman, the mayor of the tiny, working-class community of Braddock, near Pittsburgh, who finished third in the Democratic Senate primary, would have been a better Senate candidate than Katie McGinty, who won the nomination with the support of Democrats in Washington but failed to topple Toomey, Kenney said. And he criticized Hillary Clinton's campaign for spending too much time in Philadelphia — which she carried with 83 percent of the vote — when she should have been in the battleground areas that cost her the election. \n“She spent too much time in Philadelphia,\" Kenney said. \"We didn’t need to see her. She should’ve been in Wisconsin and Michigan and western Pennsylvania. They were great events. The rallies were great. It was great to see President Clinton. But it didn’t do anything. They were voting for her, anyway.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T04:23:50.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
