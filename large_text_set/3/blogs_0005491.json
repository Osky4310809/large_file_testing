It recently introduced the battery-focussed nubia N1 ( review ) in India, and it seems that the brand is prepping to launch its affordable variant in the form of the nubia N1 Lite soon. The smartphone was unveiled at MWC last week, and we got a chance to play with it briefly. Here’s how we’ll sum up our initial experience. \nThe N1 Lite is in every way a scaled-down version of the nubia N1. While the nubia N1 Lite continues with a phablet-sized display of 5.5-inches like the N1, its resolution is has been downgraded to 1,280 x 720 pixels. This certainly affects the sharpness levels, although when you view the screen closely, the colour reproduction seems decent enough. \nThe build quality also takes a hit with the lite variant of the nubia N1. Instead of the unibody metallic construction, the nubia N1 Lite features a plastic build. The matte-finished rear panel keeps off the smudges and offers good grip. The panel is removable and hides the slots for inserting the nano-SIM and microSD cards. The design elements are also slightly different at the rear as both the camera unit and fingerprint scanner are placed symmetrically on a vertical strip. The placement of buttons and ports is largely similar though. nubia N1 Lite design gallery 1 of 6 \nAt the heart of the nubia N1 Lite lies the MediaTek MT6737 quad-core chipset humming at 1.3GHz. It’s mated with 2GB of RAM, which should be fine for day-to-day tasks. Casual games should also work fine, although we’re doubtful whether the hardware combo would be capable of running graphics-intensive titles. The storage needs are taken care of by 16GB of flash memory, which can be further expanded via microSD cards. \nIn the camera department, the nubia N1 Lite features an 8-megapixel shooter at the back with an aperture of f/2.0. There’s a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. For illumination in poorly-lit conditions, both cameras can make use of dedicated LED flash units. \nSadly, the N1 Lite continues with the older iteration of Android, i.e. 6.0 Marshmallow. Moreover with the older-gen MTK chipset we’re highly doubtful if it’ll get updated to Android 7.0 Nougat. Interface-wise, you’d find it to be same as most Chinese UIs with no app drawer, custom icons, etc. \nWhile the nubia N1’s USP was its big battery of 5,000mAh, the nubia N1 Lite is fuelled by a standard 3,000mAh pack. However, with its HD screen resolution, the device should be able to last an entire day of usage. \nThe recently-launched nubia N1 manages to stand out amidst the competition from the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( review ) and Honor 6X ( review ), mainly because it’s got the pricing right. If the nubia N1 Lite is priced aggressively as well – under Rs 10,000 – it should be able to shake up the budget segment. The device is slated to go on sale by the end of this month in India. We’ll surely bring you more on the phone and its capabilities once it’s officially available in the subcontinent. \nPhotos by Ketaki Bhojnagarwala", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:53:35.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
