Kevin Durant and Jay Electronica were in attendance, and at one point Jay Electronica came up to take the mic and say some words. \"I appreciate you, dog. I love you, bro,\" he told Hov \n\"Let's go put this album out,\" Hov responded. \nJay Electronica has famously never put out a project, despite having been signed to Roc Nation since 2010. Fans have accepted that Electronica may well never release an album, though he tries their patience from time to time -- most recently, last July, when he suggested that he would drop Act II: Patents of Nobility (The Turn) within the next 40 days. (He did not.) \nCheck out highlights from the #TIDALXNOLA event below. \"Put the album out\" Jay Z to Jay Electronica last night. #TIDALXNOLA pic.twitter.com/BwIoj5sXqp — JAY Z Daily (@JAY_Z_Daily) February 18, 2017 Jay Z attended Jay Electronica's concert last night at the historic Preservation Hall - New Orleans.
