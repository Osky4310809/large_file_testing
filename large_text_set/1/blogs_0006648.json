(CBS) — One day after Rafael Robb was released from prison for beating his wife to death more than a decade ago, her friends and family gathered outside the Upper Merion home where she was murdered. \nSurrounded by family and friends, Gary Gregory choked back tears as he spoke about the murder of his sister, Ellen. \nIn 2006, her husband, Rafael Robb was convicted of bludgeoning her to death with a metal bar as she wrapped Christmas gifts. \nIn the past, Robb has tried unsuccessfully to secure an early release , but after serving all ten years of his prison term for voluntary manslaughter, Robb, a 66-year-old former Penn professor, is now a free man. \n“He was a manipulative, abusive husband, a cowardly monster. He was unremorseful and is a serial liar.” \nMichael Vereb, a former Pennsylvania State Representative says, “We know that the monster is out of the cage, but the monster, Rafael Robb, needs to know that there’s a vacancy in every state prison in this commonwealth.” A floral memorial hangs with Ellen Gregory Robb’s initials at the home where she was killed by her husband #RafaelRobb .

They’ll continue fight. @KYWNewsradio \n— Jim Melwert (@JMelwert) January 9, 2017 \nGregory says, “Ellen was in many respects the face of domestic violence. She was a loving mother who stayed in a relationship – an abusive relationship – because she thought it was best for her daughter.” \nRobb is appealing a civil jury verdict that requires he pay $128 million to his wife’s estate, the assets to go to his now-adult daughter. \nHowever, the Montgomery County DA’s office is reviewing the possibility Robb may have committed perjury regarding testimony in reference to a bank account in France. \nRobb testified he is planning to rent an apartment in Pittsburgh, but without money he may be forced to return to the Forest Road home. \nA neighbor and friend of Ellen’s said in that case, “Don’t think that we would not act, I’m not sure in what way we would do that, but we are around and we see everything that goes on.” Jim Melwert Follow Jim Melwert is the Suburban Bureau chief for KYW Newsradio 1060, based at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa.
