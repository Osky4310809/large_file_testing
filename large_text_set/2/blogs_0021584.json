The fighting senator, however, has already looked at a different direction, announcing on Wednesday that he's in negotiations with Khan . Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nUnlike the Dubai offer, Lonergan said they have shown the money. \n\"In all likelihood he [Pacquiao] is chasing rainbows with the [$38 million] offer,\" the promoter continued. \nEven Arum himself is skeptical of the $38 million purse being dangled at Pacquiao by the parties in the UAE. \nLonergan, for his part, added that Pacquiao is welcome to fight Horn should he change his mind. \n\"We have a very substantial offer for Manny to fight Jeff Horn in Brisbane on April 23. It is real money and it remains on the table. We still hope to see him fighting in Brisbane,\" he said.
