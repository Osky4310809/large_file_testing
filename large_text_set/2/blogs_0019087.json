She has single-handedly ruled our TV screens and living rooms – and that’s no mean feat. \nCurrently, Ekta has a bunch of ongoing shows, such as Ye Hai Mohabbatein , Naagin , Pardes Mein Hai Mera Dil and Kumkum Bhagya etc. No wonder then every once in a while, Balaji’s head honcho has to take drastic measures to maintain her numero uno position. Although all her shows are a hit with the audience, the ratings are getting affected due to the footage of the show being leaked online.
