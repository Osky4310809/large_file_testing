Kiddie-pop hits such as \"Candy Girl,\" \"Cool It Now,\" and \"Mr. Telephone Man\" are included, along with their final hits \"If It Isn't Love,\" \"Can You Stand the Rain,\" and the appropriately titled \"Is This the End.\" This anthology shows how dominant New Edition was during the 1980s and early '90s.
