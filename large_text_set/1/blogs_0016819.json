Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPep Guardiola has admitted he must shoulder the blame for calamity keeper Claudio Bravo’s woeful form this season. \nBravo was the fall-guy last weekend, as City were hammered 4-0 at Everton, a defeat that prompted City boss Guardiola to concede the title. \nGuardiola admitted dropping Bravo - brought in supposedly as an upgrade for former City No.1 Joe Hart - was an option, but said he still has faith in the Chile stopper. \nWhile Guardiola would not admit trading Bravo for Hart had backfired, he conceded his own tinkering at the back, in terms of systems and personnel, had been a factor. Guardiola has been discussing his defensive problems (Photo: REUTERS) \nGuardiola has fielded 13 different back-fours and six different back-threes this season, and did not keep same the back five in successive games until December. \nAgainst that backdrop, Guardiola admitted he was culpable in Bravo’s ongoing struggles, with the City keeper once again in the spotlight for today’s visit of high-flying Tottenham. \nEverton had only four shots on target at Goodison Park but converted them all, a damning statistic that proves the folly of jettisoning Hart for Bravo. \n“I never say the reason why we lost is because of Claudio Bravo,” said Guardiola. “It’s one of the reasons why, but there are many many other reasons why.

Maybe, but we’ll never know that. \n“I’m sorry, I’d like to know exactly 100 per cent and then I would not answer ‘maybe’, I would answer you: ‘Yeah, that’s true’, but I’ll never know. \n“You have to accept what happens right now about my job. Of course I’m willing to accept that. \n“What happens in the club, I said many times, in the team, I said many times [is my responsibility]. \n“Always, five minutes after the game finishes, I say ‘what can I do to get the team better. I never in my life blame bad results, the reason why, I never did, I don’t do it.” \nWhen David De Gea was struggling to adapt to the physical nature of the Premier League in his debut season at Manchester United, Sir Alex Ferguson took him out of the firing line.
