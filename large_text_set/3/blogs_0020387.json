Delivery services like Instacart (which is doing a test with Costco), Amazon Fresh, Google Express, and FreshDirect have proliferated, while some major chains like Kroger kr and Walmart wmt have teamed up with services like Uber and Lyft on a test basis. Costco rival Sam’s Club has focused its efforts on ramping up drive-by pick up at its stores.\n\nShipt members pay an annual $99 annual fee for unlimited grocery delivery.\nThe venture capital-backed company, founded in 2014, has previously worked with grocers like Whole Foods and Harris Teeter, part of Kroger. Last year, Shipt raised more than $20 million in a new funding round with a group of investors that included Greycroft Partners, Harbert Growth Partners, and e.ventures. The startup, founded in Birmingham, Ala., says it already offers delivery in 35 cities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:11:34.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
