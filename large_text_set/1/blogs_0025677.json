The two extras include a clear case for the Honor 8 and a Doctor Strange movie gift box.\n\nYes, you may not be aware but the Honor 8 was one of the official tie-in products to the recent Marvel Studios version of the comic book-based Master of the Mystic Arts. The Doctor Strange gift box for the phone costs $69.99 on its own, but you get it with this bundle for free. In addition to its own collectible box, it contains an Honor 8 case with Doctor Strange-related artwork on the back, along with two Marvel comic books. It looks like a pretty nice, and different, add-on, especially if you are a fan of Marvel’s movies.\nAs we said, the Honor 8 remains a solid smartphone in terms of hardware. It has a 5.2-inch Full HD display, a Kirin 950 octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM, two 12MP rear cameras, an 8MP front-facing camera, a rear fingerprint reader and a 3000mAh battery. Plus, your phone will be getting the latest Android OS very soon, so there’s that.\nWill you be jumping in with your own Eye of Agamotto to get this pretty cool Honor 8 bundle, or will you be held back by the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak? Let us know your feelings in the comments, or feel the wrath of the Dread Dormammu!\nGet it at B&H Photo ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T05:02:04.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
