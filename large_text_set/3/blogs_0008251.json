Could   \nIt is the stick-thin wrists that first mark out severely malnourished children like Hamdi Ahmed in drought-stricken Somalia. \nAt a clinic where dozens of desperately-ill babies are being brought in for emergency ­treatment, the skeletal girl lies listlessly in her mum Ayaan’s arms. Six months old but weighing less than 8lb – the average for a newborn in Britain – she shifts her head slowly towards me. \nOnly then do I see it is covered in white blotches, her mouth is red with a sore rash, and her eyes are painfully sealed over. \nHamdi is so hungry her body’s defence system has failed, leaving her prone to infection. She looks ready to die. \nAfter three years without rain, the longest dry spell since records began here in 1950, Somalia is on the cusp of a devastating famine.

Her mother cannot breastfeed as she is not eating enough.” \nHamdi is just one of more than 20 million people afflicted by an unprecedented food crisis across four countries, Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen.

Around 6.2 million people – more than half the population – are in dire need of assistance. \nLatest surveys show 363,000 vulnerable children suffering from malnutrition, including 71,000 severe cases like Hamdi. \nWithout cattle and goats to trade for other foods such as rice and flour, families like hers living in the rocky red-sand desert have nothing. \nSo drastic are conditions that when a brief shower fell over one coastal region in December last year, 30,000 nomads marched off in the hope of saving their vital herds. \nThey left their wives and children to fend for themselves in makeshift camps. Fadumo was lucky enough to make it to this clinic in Garowe, the only one for 200 miles in any direction.

He had severe anaemia and hypoglycaemia when he arrived. \nAsha tells me: “He was so weak he couldn’t eat even if we had food to give him. He has been getting more and more ill for two months. \n“For now he seems to be getting slowly better, but we live in a camp three hours from here. There I don’t know how we will get food as all of our goats have died. We used to have 400.” Read More Orange-bearded British ISIS leader sets up base in Somalia as part of terror group's expansion plans Little Ahmed has the telltale signs – vomiting, diarrhoea and weakness (Photo: Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror) \nUpsetting scenes are the daily routine for the clinic doctors. The number of malnutrition admissions doubled from January to February. \nDr Hamed says the clinic does not have the capacity to feed and rehydrate the many ­children arriving now. \nIn an adjoining ward I see 18-month-old Amina Issa, who has kidney problems linked to her hunger. She is so weak that she fails to react when the doctor touches her hand. \nTubes come out of her nose and mouth to help her breathe and top up her critically low glucose levels. Mum Ayan tells me: “We did not bring her to the clinic because we could not afford the transport. The cost of food has gone up by 50% so we have no money left.

I carried her here in my arms. \n“Imagine what that was like for me, her mother, to see her suffering like that.” \nTo compound the doctors’ challenges, the mothers too are malnourished and therefore cannot breastfeed babies. Meanwhile, many more are dying unseen without help, scouring the parched landscape in search of their next meal. \nIn a rabbit warren of ­corrugated iron shacks on the edge of Garowe, I meet grieving dad Nour Jees, 43, whose baby daughter Asluub has just died at less than three weeks old. \nThe cause was acute watery diarrhoea, brought on by having to give the tot ­contaminated water because of the drought.

The patch of scrubland has been set aside for dead children. There are more than 100 graves, 28 made in the past month. Across the arid Puntland region, where Somali cargo ship pirates prospered until recently, the evidence of the drought is everywhere. \nCarcasses of decomposing cows and goats litter the roadside, covered by clouds of flies. There is no vegetation except for thorny acacia bushes. Nothing thrives in the relentless blistering heat. Our vehicle leaves a cloud of dust in its wake as we travel to remote Uskure camp. \nThe unforgiving landscape often appears like the surface of Mars. In one pitiful wicker-frame shelter covered by cattle-hide and torn tarpaulins are two dangerously malnourished children, nine-month-old Ahmed and his elder sister Farhigo, two.

I have had to borrow money from others to get food and now they will not lend any more.” \nAfter another bumpy two-hour ride we reach an outreach malnutrition clinic run by aid agency Save The Children in Shahda. Mirror man Tom Parry in Puntland, Somalia (Photo: Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror) \nA nurse is weighing three brothers, all under five. The youngest, Abdurahman, two, has ­bronchitis and pneumonia. The eldest, Abdulahi, five, has a high fever. The medic wraps a special tape measure around their wrists. A ­circumference reading on the green part of the tape would be healthy. None of them achieve this. \nAbdulahi looks so brittle he could snap. Seeing them is a graphic illustration of how this latest looming disaster could be even worse than the 2011 Somalia famine which claimed 260,000 lives. \nThis time, seasonal rains which usually fall after April are predicted to be well below average. The brother and sister of tragic baby girl Asluub need your help (Photo: Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror) \nLast month Britain’s special envoy for the Horn of Africa, Sir Nicholas Kay, warned hundreds of thousands could die within months. \nSave The Children is already overstretched, so the UN is calling on wealthy nations to provide nearly £700million in emergency funds. Yet pledges so far are not even close. \nAfter decades of upheaval, barren Somalia’s latest catastrophe is waiting in the wings. \nNow fighting a battle with nature, its first ­casualties are defenceless children like Hamdi. How you can help \nSave The Children chief executive Kevin Watkins wants G7 countries, including Britain, to step up quickly. \nOne of the charity’s biggest concerns is the surge in people dying from cholera and diarrhoea. \n“Saving these lives and rebuilding livelihoods will require concerted action by the international community – and that action needs to start now,” he said. \n“The response to the crisis facing Somalia’s children is indefensible and unforgivable. The international community ignored the early warning signs, failed to act decisively. They are now repeating all of the mistakes.” \nTo donate to Save the Children’s East Africa appeal, or for more information, go to http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us/emergencies/east-africa-food-crisis-appeal Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:28:59.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
