Students will also be prohibited from entering hostels after 10PM. \nThe ban is a reaction to a brawl between two student groups at the university on March 21 in which 18 students were injured. A student group was celebrating their cultural day outside the Faisal Auditorium when a rival student group arrived and began chanting slogans against them. \nSoon both the groups were raising slogans against each other, which led to an all-out brawl. The students were seen attacking each other with batons and by pelting bricks. Upon worsening of the situation, authorities called in the police, who resorted to aerial firing and tear-gassing to control enraged pupils. \nOn Wednesday, Punjab Government spokesman Malik Ahmed Khan said no one would be allowed to create chaos at Punjab University. A case has also been registered against arrested students as well as unknown persons at Muslim Town police station. 0 0 Punjab University bans student organisations from holding events   Ban On Student Orgainsation Punjab University, Geo News, Latest News, Punjab University, Student Ban Punjab University, Student Organisations Ban.   \"Punjab University bans student organisations from holding events\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/135384-Punjab-University-bans-student-organisations-from-holding-events+geo%2FGiKR+%28Geo+Pakistan+- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T12:48:15.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
