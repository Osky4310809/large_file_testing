We shall seek greater coverage of the minimum wage to include all Nigerian workers, whether working in the formal or informal sectors.” \n“In this light, we shall work towards designing a wage scheme that would be automatically self-adjusting, just like it is done in other advanced nations of the world bearing in mind that in the United States, as just yesterday, the minimum wage automatically went upwards from $8 per hour to $11per hour. \n“This is a national increase of about 37.5 percent in a nation with declining inflation and low cost of living. We shall get involved in assisting governments implement their respective budgets through effective budget monitoring framework and shall constitute a nation-wide committee using our respective state councils in conjunction with other civil society organisations to monitor budget implementation both at the federal and state levels. \nThis, the Assembly believes will help government plug all leakages in their budget implementation processes.” \nCommending the Federal Government and the military in their various victories against the Boko Haram insurgents especially its recent victory in the Sambisa forest battle, ULC urged “Government to deploy the same zeal in protecting the lives and properties of citizens across Nigeria who are mindlessly being mowed down by death merchants in Kaduna and in other hotspots in the country. \nWe also wish that this same zeal is deployed to clinically deal with the battle against corruption. It is time that governments at all levels craft responsive and effective strategies to combat the current hardship in the country. Nigerians truly are yearning for a reprieve from the grip of mass hunger and deprivation.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T13:00:21.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
