By David Floyd | Updated January 24, 2017 — 9:24 AM EST Loading the player... \nIn October, Donald Trump's campaign published a document containing 18 actions he promised to accomplish on the first day of his presidency. Some were more ambitious than others: a third amounted to policy announcements which, by issuing the document, he had in effect already made. But some were fairly meaty: \"suspend immigration from terror-prone regions,\" for example, and \"cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities.\" Most ambitiously of all, he promised to \"cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.\" \nAs the end of business on his first day, he has not done those things. But as we wrote Friday , Trump was unlikely to get through his entire laundry list on day one. Perhaps recognizing that he'd need at least a full day – without the distraction of galas and other Inauguration Day goings-on – he told the London Times that \"day one\" meant Monday. Obamacare \nAs it happened, Trump did get a head start on Friday, signing an executive order reiterating his intention to repeal the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\") and instructing the heads of his agencies – in particular his nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price , who is awaiting Senate confirmation – to \"exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\" (See also, The Beginning of the End of Obamacare . ) \nThe sheer breadth of that directive appears to mean that agencies should not enforce Obamacare's provisions. At a Monday afternoon press conference, press secretary Sean Spicer ducked a question about whether the administration would enforce the law's individual mandate, which penalizes those who do not obtain insurance. The order also instructed agency heads to \"provide greater flexibility to States\" in implementing the law to and to \"encourage the development of a free and open market in interstate commerce for the offering of healthcare services and health insurance.\" Regulations \nOn Friday, Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus issued a memorandum instructing agencies to suspend new regulations that have been sent to the Federal Register but not yet published. Where possible, he also told them to withdraw published regulations for a 60-day review period. \nTrump promised to implement \"a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated\" on his first day. While this memo does not go that far, it may be a signal that Trump intends to cut back on regulations. From a practical perspective, it also prevents some of the Obama administration's final rule-making blitz from going into effect: the January 17, 18 and 19 editions of the Federal Register run to 2,876 pages. Abortion \nOn Monday, Trump signed an order reinstating the so-called Mexico City Policy, which prevents foreign NGOs that receive federal funding from performing or promoting abortion abroad. Since the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is already prohibited from providing funds for abortion by the 1973 Helms Amendment, the law prohibits funding for organizations that provide or promote abortions using non-U.S. funding. \nPlanned Parenthood, which refers to the policy as the \"Global Gag Rule,\" issued a statement Monday saying that Trump's order \"prohibits international organizations from receiving U.S. family planning funding if they mention or provide information about abortion, or even refer for abortion services. The gag rule prohibits these activities even if organizations carry them out with their own, non-U.S. funding, and even if abortion is legal in their own country.\" \nThe policy was first enacted in 1984 by Ronald Reagan, then revoked by Bill Clinton in 1993, then restored by George W. Bush in 2001, then revoked by Barack Obama in 2009. Clinton, Bush and Obama all took their respective actions within a few days of taking office, so the order did not come as a surprise. Trans-Pacific Partnership \nTrump signed an order withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a multilateral trade agreement that would have linked the U.S. with 11 other Pacific-Rim economies, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and Peru – but excluding China. Following a decade of negotiations, the agreement had been signed by all parties but not ratified by Congress. It was considered dead on arrival, making Trump's action purely symbolic. (See also: President Trump Strikes TPP .) \n\"Great thing for the American worker, what we just did,\" Trump commented after signing the order. Hiring Freeze \nTrump's third and final executive order Monday implemented a federal hiring freeze, retroactively effective as of noon Sunday. The freeze does not apply to the military and makes exceptions for positions the head of an agency \"deems necessary to meet national security or public safety responsibilities.\" The director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may also grant exemptions from the freeze. \nThe order does not affect the political appointments or nominations requiring Senate confirmation. The New York Times editorial board, writing shortly after the election, said that a new administration could expect to hire over 4,000 staffers, around 1,000 of whom require Senate confirmation. Politico reported the day before the inauguration that only 4% of roles requiring Senate confirmation had been filled. \nQuestions remain about what the hiring freeze will accomplish. Trump aims \"to reduce [the] federal workforce through attrition,\" but the government employs three times as many workers over 60 as under 30, Partnership for Public Service CEO Max Stier told the Washington Post Monday. If younger workers change jobs at a faster rate than older ones retire, that ratio could increase. \nMany have expressed anxiety that the freeze may increase its reliance on contractors. The government does not keep official data on contract workers, but according to New York University professor Paul Light, the number of government contractors doubled between 1999 and 2010. Anticipating this workaround, the order says, \"Contracting outside the Government to circumvent the intent of this memorandum shall not be permitted.\" \nGiven the broad exceptions laid out in the order, it is possible that the federal payroll will continue to expand. That's what happened under Reagan, the last president to impose a hiring freeze. What Changed? \nPreibus' memo to the agencies amounts to housekeeping: an instruction to stop issuing rules that reflect Obama-administration priorities. The order withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership had no practical effect, since the deal was all but dead. The abortion rule, while not insignificant, is a predictable result of the political pendulum's swinging right: the rule is always revoked or reinstated in the first few days of a new administration, depending on the party. \nThe Obamacare order has the potential to have much greater effect, since its sweeping language – combined with a clear signal that the administration intends to do away with the law – may allow agencies to simply stop enforcing its provisions, hastening its end in practice while Congress prepares to repeal it. The effects of the hiring freeze are unclear, since the administration is unlikely to leave the vast majority of its positions unfilled.
