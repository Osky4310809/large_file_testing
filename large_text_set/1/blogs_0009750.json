It's time to take a tour of the major buildings in Downtown Detroit. We did a similar map a few years ago, and we're happy to say that some of the buildings people feared would be demolished are either renovated or in the process of renovation. We included the major buildings from the riverfront to Grand Circus Park. \nWe didn't include all of our favorites, just the most recognizable. The Penobscot stands tall in the skyline, as does the Ren Center and One Detroit (or Ally Detroit). While others, like the Guardian Building and the David Whitney, have some of the most beautiful lobbies in the city. \nIf you find yourself in Capitol Park or Harmonie Park , we have separate maps for those areas, which are both seeing a surge in renovations. \nTime to head out and explore the city! Did we miss your favorite? Let us know in the comments or the tip line . 1 One Woodward Avenue \nDesigned by Minoru Yamasaki and opened in 1963 as the Michigan Consolidated Gas Company, One Woodward stands 32 stories high right across from Hart Plaza and houses offices (most recently home to Fifth Third Bank). Also look for the ballerina sculpture out front.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:22:00.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
