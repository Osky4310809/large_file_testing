I also think it had different sound to it than any KsE stuff. The Forgotten One anyone? There's no acoustic ballads on any KsE album. Any new music from these guys is good news, stop whining. 2 Yes, it had somewhat of an different sound but still it was really close to the coresound of KSE. 2 Why tho? The new Killswitch stuff since Jesse came back sounds very similar to TOG. So really, whats the point? 2 I loved the last Times of Grace album. Didn't see another one coming now that Jessie's back in Killswitch Engage, but I'm glad they went back to it! 1 Zan595 214 · 10 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply Why would they make another Times of Grace records since it was pretty much just like KSE with Jesse? Unless they radically change the sound this time. edit: oh he actually wrote that it should be quite different from the first. 2 © 2017 Ultimate-Guitar.com.
