Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGary Lineker's prolific use of Twitter was always likely to come back and bite him on the bum at some point. \nThe England legend turned Match of the Day host is perhaps football's most high-profile, influential tweeter. With a following of 5.62 million people, when Lineker posts something on Twitter, the world tends to notice. \nUnfortunately for Leicester City's most famous fan, that is not always a good thing. \nAfter the amazingness of last season, Lineker's beloved Foxes are currently struggling their way through a particularly disastrous title defence. After their 2-0 defeat at Swansea, they are currently hovering just above the relegation zone. Happier times for Lineker the Leicester fan (Photo: Getty) \nAs calamitous as Leicester's transformation from Premier League champions to Premier League strugglers might appear, it was only a couple of years ago that we saw Chelsea do something very similar. \nIt's easy to forget now, but just a few months after winning the 2014/15 title, Jose Mourinho's side were stuck in the bottom half of the table. Back in October 2015, there was even talk of the then Premier League champions being pulled into a relegation dogfight. \nHence Lineker posting this little joke at the time: \nBack then, it would have been hard to see how a gag about Premier League champions potentially getting relegated could ever come back to haunt the man who scored 10 World Cup goals for England. \nBut fast forward the best part of a year and a half, and in a remarkable coincidence, it's Lineker's own Leicester side who are facing that exact situation. \nAnd sure enough, certain social media comedians have resurrected that old tweet… \nIn fairness to Lineker, he has taken his medicine. \nAs a Twitter super-user, he understands this sort of thing is the nature of the beast: \nBut still, it acts as another example for all famous people using Twitter. \nWhatever you post and whenever you post it, there WILL be a tweet that will used against you in the future… Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:23:06.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
