City aren't certain of a quarter-final spot despite their FIVE first-leg goals (Photo: Getty) \n“Definitely,” said the midfield star. “From my point of view, and maybe the manager’s too, the best way to defend is to attack. The best defence is try to score and they know that, they will be careful with us. \n“You saw Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain — I don’t need to say any more. It was 4-0 and then it’s 6-1. \n\"Our two goals are nothing for a team like Monaco, who are winning all their league games four or 5-0. \n“PSG had fantastic players up front, but they were trying to defend. Paris Saint-Germain players were partying on the pitch after beating Barca 4-0... (Photo: Getty) ...but it was despair in the return as Barcelona staged their great escape (Photo: AFP/Getty) \n\"I think it was a lack of intensity because maybe they were four goals in front. In the dressing room, those kind of games are warnings. We’re going to attack. We never do it the other way. We will attack and they will expect that as well.” \nToure insists City will not be gung-ho against Monaco and he is wary of their potent attack, which has scored 123 goals already this season. \nThe Ivorian, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2009, claims the key for City is to have a balanced approach. \n“Yeah, that’s very important because in Europe you’re going to find such tough strikers,” he said.
