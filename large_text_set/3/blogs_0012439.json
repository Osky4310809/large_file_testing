Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGareth Southgate has named Jermain Defoe in his England squad for the upcoming fixtures against Germany and Lithuania. \nThe 34-year-old striker's last appearance in a Three Lions shirt came in a 2-0 friendly defeat by Chile at Wembley in November 2013. \nBut his fine form for Premier League strugglers Sunderland this season, coupled with injuries to Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane and Daniel Sturridge, has seen him earn a recall to the squad. \nDefoe, who has scored 14 goals in 27 top-flight appearances this season, made his England debut in March 2004 and has scored 19 times in 55 appearances for his country. \nEngland travel to Dortmund for a friendly against Germany on March 22 before a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley four days later.
