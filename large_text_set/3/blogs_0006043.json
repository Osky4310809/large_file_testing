Consumption of carbonated soft drinks slipped to 38.5 gallons - less than bottled water Credit: Alamy \nI n contrast, per capita soda consumption regularly exceeded 50 gallons in the late 1990s and early 2000s, according to the report. \nTotal bottled water volume rose about 9 percent to 12.8 billion gallons in 2016, compared with a year earlier. \n\"When Perrier first entered the country in the 1970s, few would have predicted the heights to which bottled water would eventually climb,\" said Michael Bellas, chairman and chief executive, Beverage Marketing Corp. About | The sugar tax \nT he UK is also introducing a sugar tax to combat obesity in children. \nOn Wednesday, the Chancellor set the rate for the sugar tax - but warned it will raise less than originally expected. \nThe levy rate for added-sugar drinks with a total sugar content of 5g or more per 100 mililitres will be 18p per litre, while it will be 24p per litre for those drinks with 8g or more. \nM r Hammond said the makers of these types of drinks had already reduced the amount of sugar in their products, meaning less cash would be raised through the tax, but declared this as \"good news for our children\".
