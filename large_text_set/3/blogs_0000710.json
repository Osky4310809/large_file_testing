Called the MCL32, the new car’s livery pays tribute to the classic McLaren racing cars of the 1960s, and marks a new era in the company following the departure of Ron Dennis. \nThe MCL32 also abandons the naming nomenclature of previous cars using ‘MP’, which started with the MP4/1 from 1981 up until its predecessor, the MP4-31. \nBeneath the Tarocca Orange-painted engine bay, a revised RA617H engine from Honda, which is built to meet 2017 F1 regulations, powers the MCL32. The car’s bodywork and chassis have also been overhauled to follow this year’s rules, including larger tyres and reworked aerodynamic components. \nFor the latter, you’ll notice items such as a intricate front wing, appendages in front of the side pod intakes, a massive rear stabiliser fin as well as further detailing on the wider rear wing. \nWith the departure of Jenson Button (retirement), the team’s reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne has been assigned to become Fernando Alonso’s new teammate. The two-team world champion said: “What I’ve seen of the MCL32 appears to be really promising – the new regulations seem to be well thought-out, and the cars look fast and aggressive.” Research Honda Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:04:18.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
