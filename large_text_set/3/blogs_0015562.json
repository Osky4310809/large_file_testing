(Walter Iooss Jr./Sports Illustrated/Getty Images) Sunday, March 19, 2017, 9:47 PM \nSan Francisco 49ers legendary wide receiver Dwight Clark announced Sunday night that he has ALS. \nIn a blog post , Clark, 60, wrote that he began feeling “weakness” in his left hand back in September of 2015 and after months of tests was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease. \nHe believes that playing in the NFL for eight seasons, from 1979 to 1987, caused his ALS. \n“I don’t know for sure. But I certainly suspect it did,” Clark wrote. “And I encourage the NFLPA and the NFL to continue working together in their efforts to make the game of football safer, especially as it relates to head trauma.” \nWhile Clark said the disease “seems to be progressing more slowly than in some patients,” it is already showing its effects on him. \n“I can’t run, play golf or walk any distances,” he wrote. “Picking up anything over 30 pounds is a chore.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:05:42.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
