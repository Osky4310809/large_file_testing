We need their support to defeat the jihad.” \nO’Reilly concluded thusly: \n“We don’t want to tarnish the message the Statue of Liberty sends. Also, the administration must be willing to grant exceptions. And above all, should help refugees survive in the terror zones abroad… Protecting Americans is obviously priority number one, but the nobility of our nation demands we help suffering, helpless people if we can.” \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T04:04:11.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
