Show More \nAfter performing together at the Grammys last month, the Weeknd has shared the Warren Fu-directed music video for his chart-topping Daft Punk collaboration, \"I Feel It Coming,\" off his 2016 album Starboy . \nSet on a planet straight out of a 1950s sci-fi film, the clip finds the Canadian R&B star singing alone in the middle of a mountainous landscape, before dancing with a woman (played by US actor and model Kiko Mizuhara) who meets a stoney fate.
