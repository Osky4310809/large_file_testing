Thousands of donkeys in the state have taken to the streets of Lucknow to protest against politicization of their community during the ongoing state elections. They are coming! \nIt all started with the incumbent CM Akhilesh Yadav asking Bollywood superstar to stop doing ads promotion ‘ Gujarat Ke Gadhe’ . We still don’t know why he chose to bring that up. In response, PM Narendra Modi said that donkeys are very good animals who keep working for their masters even when they are hungry and tired. \nDonkeys association has condemned both the statements and has asked the politicians to leave them alone. Speaking to Faking News, a leading member of donkey protest march said ,”What was the need for Akhilesh Yadav to drag us into politics? We were quietly going about our work without disturbing anyone but he had to needle us. Why shouldn’t Amitabh Bachchan do an ad featuring us? He promotes every single product in the world but Akhilesh ji doesn’t have a problem, he promotes our brothers and suddenly there is an outrage? Why this discrimination against us?” \n“We are also not happy with Modi Ji. What does he mean when he says donkeys will keep working even when they are hungry. Is he telling our masters that they don’t need to feed us? We also need lunch break like any other worker bhai. Modi ji is supporting people who make us work long hours without giving us a break. We don’t even get overtime. This practice must be condemned, not glorified”, the donkey said. \nWhen we asked a veteran political expert if this donkey march will have an impact on the state elections, he said ,”Well it is possible that this turns the election. After all, kai gadhe chunav lad bhi to rahe hain.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:59:05.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
