The Bier Stein in Eugene rounds out the Oregon entries. \nHere's what USA Today had to say about... \n... No. 10: Bailey's Taproom \"There's always something new and interesting pouring from Bailey's Taproom's 26 rotating taps, though this beer bar does place an emphasis on Oregon brews. Patrons at this Portland bar are welcome to bring their own food to enjoy (no food is served on-site) while sipping a beer, and bottled beers can be enjoyed on site or purchased to-go.\" \n... No. 9: The Bier Stein \"With 30 rotating taps and more than 1,000 bottles of craft beer from all over the world, Bier Stein in Eugene is a beer enthusiast's heaven and one of the best craft beer bars in the Pacific Northwest. Cicerone-certified \"beer stewards\" help patrons make informed decisions, and style-specific glassware adds to the experience. In addition to enjoying a pint in the pub, a huge selection of bottles are available for purchase in the shop.\" \n... No. 6: Belmont Station \"Founded in 1997, Belmont Station has become a favorite destination for beer drinkers in Portland , thanks to its more than 20 rotating taps in the Biercafe and 1,200-plus bottles in the adjacent bottle shop. Many draft beers are also available for growlers to go.\" \nSee the full list here . \nAnd in case you missed it, yes, Belmont Station turns 20 this year. They plan to celebrate on April 1 -- no joke, I hope -- by walking from their original Southeast Belmont Street home next to the Horse Brass to their current digs at 4500 S.E. Stark St. The public is welcome to join the brewers, distributors and members of the Oregon Piper Society in marching the four blocks for a complimentary toast of of 3-Headed Monster IPA, the first tapping of this Barley Brown's, Boneyard and Melvin Brewing collaboration. \n-- Michael Russell Featuring the latest and best from Oregon's thriving brew culture, delivered every Friday.
