The Times fills its front page with an image of several police officers helping those injured in what it calls an \"an assault on Westminster\". Image caption \"Terror at the heart of power\" is the headline on the front of the Metro. Its main image shows an armed officer stood over the attacker. The O in the word \"Metro\" has been changed to resemble the London Underground logo and contains the words \"we are not afraid\". Image caption The Daily Express also uses the image of the armed officer. It highlights the efforts of a \"brave MP\" who fought to save the policeman killed in the attack and a woman who survived after jumping from Westminster Bridge into the River Thames. Some of the front pages below may be considered disturbing. Image caption The Guardian carries the image of Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood who helped paramedics try to save the life of the police officer stabbed in the attack. The front page says the attack \"appeared to be a direct copy of an Islamic State tactic used with murderous effect in Nice and Berlin\" and the attacker's identity was known to counter-terrorism officials. Image caption The photo of Mr Ellwood is also used on the front of the i. It says at least five people are dead in the incident and highlights a quote from Prime Minister Theresa May who said \"we stand together against the forces of evil\". Image caption \"Attack on democracy\" is the headline on the Daily Mirror. Its main photo is of paramedics treating the attacker as he lay on a stretcher. Image caption The Daily Star also carries the image of the attacker being treated by medics and goes with the headline \"Terror in London\". Image caption \"We will never allow evil to drive us apart\" is the message from Theresa May that the Daily Telegraph uses as the headline on its front page. Its says the attack exposed \"critical flaws\" in the security of Westminster as MPs said the attacker had exploited a \"well-known weak spot\". Image caption The Daily Mail's headline says the attack was the \"Day terror came to Westminster\". It uses a zoomed-in image, much more detailed than the other newspapers, of paramedic treating the attacker who was shot by police and later died. Image caption The Sun also carries the photograph of the attacker being treated. The paper says he \"knifed Britain in the heart\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:50:50.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
