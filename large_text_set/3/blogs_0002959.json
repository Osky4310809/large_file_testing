Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThis Morning viewers were left very angry with presenter Alice Beer on today's show, as she interviewed a couple who live in a Hobbit-style mud hut they built themselves. \nKate Burrows and her partner Alan fashioned their home out of the earth, tree trunks and straw , as they \"couldn’t afford to live in a normal rented property and pay the bills\". \nAnd Alice asked them how they wash, go to the toilet and eat. \nShe didn't seem impressed when they replied explaining they wash with soap and water, and only have a bath once a week, and cook food on a caravan stove. Kate and Alan made their own house (Photo: ITV) Alice Beer showed This Morning viewers the couple's mud hut (Photo: ITV) Viewers found her very patronising (Photo: ITV) \nAnd, when it came to the toilet, she turned her nose up when they said: \"We have a compost loo. \nIt's a wooden box, we do our business and chuck in sawdust, then nature takes care of it.\" \nAnd when it came to the smell? \n\"We prefer the scent of naturalness rather than stuff that covers it up.\" \nAlice then showed This Morning viewers Kate and Alan's bedroom which had a four-poster bed that Alan had built himself, where they watch Netflix! \nThe shocked presenter said: \"Oh hang on, you can’t run away from nature and still have Netflix!\" This is the bath they use once a week (Photo: ITV) They use a caravan stove to cook their food (Photo: ITV) \nThis Morning viewers really weren't impressed with Alice, with one saying: \"Never seen such a patronising interview in all my life.\" \nAnother agreed: \"Alice Beer is so patronising. They're obviously quite happy and dont need you turning your nose up at them.\" \nA third added: \"The woman interviewing the couple living in the mud hut on #thismorning is so rude and patronising.\" \nAnd a fourth wrote: \"Woman interviewing them is condescending. You're not funny love. It's fantastic they are able to live the way THEY want.\" The couple keep goats and chickens on their smallholding (Photo: Neil Hope / SWNS.com) Read More Former nurse trapped in her own home because mobile phone signals and wifi make her sick \nBut town hall chiefs have given the pair until December to move out of the construction in Tarka Valley, near Chumleigh, Devon. \nNorth Devon Council say the couple have broken planning laws by building the medieval-style hovel - reminiscent of homes in the hit Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films - where Kate and Alan keep goats and chickens. \nDistraught Kate said: \"This is our nest, this is our everything, this is our art. \n\"We have sculpted it with our hands from the soil. \n\"I can't go back to being ill like that, it fills me with absolute horror.\" \nKate and Alan spent six weeks building the hut on their smallholding after she said living in a modern home \"was like having flu all the time\". \nTheir home has an outside compost toilet, kitchen, living area and two bedrooms. Kate inside the fully kitted out home made from mud, trees and straw (Photo: Neil Hope / SWNS.com) \nIt is topped with tonnes of turf and the walls are lined with lime mortar. Alongside one wall is a bath supplied with hot water from a makeshift boiler. \nOutside a hand pump brings water from the river for washing, solar panels on the roof provide power and the couple keep chickens, goats and geese. \nKate said she had been living in a toxic environment and her new accommodation was the answer to all her problems. Kate Burrows outside the home that town hall chiefs say they must leave (Photo: Neil Hope / SWNS.com) \nShe added: \"I think it was the water, the electricity, the wi-fi and the paint on the walls; my body just couldn't handle it. \n\"I didn't realise how ill I was until we moved here and I started to recover.\" \nMCS is a chronic, physical illness that causes sufferers to have allergic-type reactions to very low levels of chemicals in everyday products. \nIt causes the immune and detoxification systems to stop working properly and the body cannot process toxins efficiently. \nKate is now campaigning for planning policies in England like the One Planet planning laws in Wales which can allow largely self-sustaining homes like theirs.

We're collecting water, we're chopping wood, we're growing food. \n\"Isn't that what everyone has done throughout time?\" \nNorth Devon Council planning officer Graham Townsend said they were left with no option but to take enforcement action. \nHe said: \"It is clearly not in the public interest to have houses and other structures springing up across the countryside without any permissions being obtained\". \nA Department for Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"Planning policy already promotes good design and encourages low carbon development.\" \nThey added: \"Building regulations set high standards for energy efficiency\".
