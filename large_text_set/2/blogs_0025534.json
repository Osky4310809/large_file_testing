I think it was all just a bit overwhelming.” \nWith so much going on, Beth developed anxiety and soon noticed the spots on her skin. \nBeth saw her GP and, to her dismay, was originally diagnosed with scabies – an itchy skin condition caused by the immune system reacting to mites and their saliva, eggs and faeces. \n“I originally got misdiagnosed... they told me it was scabies, which was horrific,” she recalled. “I had to tell my boyfriend and my whole family because it is contagious and transferred through close contact with the skin. I was really embarrassed.” \nThe prescribed cream for scabies didn’t work though, after struggling on through her exams, Beth consulted a nurse, who said her skin condition had been misdiagnosed. \nBut she was baffled as to what was causing the student’s dry skin. \nTwo months after Beth was told she had scabies, doctors diagnosed psoriasis and prescribed Dovobet, a steroid gel. \nIt helped, but it took her around two hours each day to apply, an hour in the morning and an hour at night to cover up the patches. \nBeth's daily routine included showering and exfoliating to remove dead skin cells, moisturising four times a day and applying make-up. She used foundation on her face, as well as special leg make-up. \nWith the lengthy routine taking up most of her day, Beth would skip the process and, fretting about her unsightly skin, she started to avoid leaving the house. \nShe said: “It got to the point where I couldn't be bothered. I would try to stay home as much as I could. I was trying to force myself to go out and not hide away, but it was difficult. \n“On nights out I couldn't go out wearing a dress. I had to be really careful about what I was going to wear. I think it was easier to put on a long sleeved top to hide my flaky skin.” \nAfter her relationship ended, she struggled to date, because it took so long to manage her condition and baring all was a daunting prospect. \n“I didn't want to get a negative reaction off guys,” she said.

It made me more confident, but I did still worry about what people might say.” \nFortunately, Beth was able to receive the ultra violet light therapy on the NHS and the light box, which she described as “a huge stand-up sunbed”. \nAt first, she could only use if for short, 17 second exposures, due to the strength of the rays and the risk of burning. \nBut, she has now built up to three minute 42 second sessions, three times a week. \nShe has been receiving the treatment for five weeks and still has four weeks of sessions remaining. \nHer face is now free of psoriasis and the red, sore and flaky marks all over her body have faded to faint, brown patches. \n“I'm hoping eventually the marks will go, but I'm not that bothered any more about it, because it doesn't feel horrible,” she said. \nDoctors don’t know if the psoriasis will return after the UVB phototherapy finishes and if so, to what degree, but Beth remains optimistic.
