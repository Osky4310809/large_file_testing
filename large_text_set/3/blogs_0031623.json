Trump admirers go further. They argue that the president has redrawn the partisan map of America, summoning into being a new populist coalition that includes millions of former Democratic voters, notably working-class whites from “forgotten” rustbelt towns and counties. The political map that elects members of Congress has not kept up, they add. Such Trump admirers have a point. They are correct that 2016 was a year in which old electoral coalitions crumbled and potential new ones came into view. They are also right that the two main party establishments feel tired and out of touch. If members of Congress were willing to learn the rules of coalition politics, an optimist might see opportunities for creative politicians to create fresh alliances and solve some intractable policy puzzles. Rule One of coalition politics is that no faction gets everything it wants—success requires understanding the trade-offs that lie at the heart of every hard dispute, and trying to give each faction a win. Today’s Congress, under unified Republican control, sees politics differently. The lesson of the health bill debacle is that too many members of Congress and of the Republican Party are still playing winner-takes-all politics. Mr Ryan blames the failure of the House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on the “growing pains” of the first unified Republican government in ten years, and in particular the hard-right House Freedom Caucus of about 30 members who remained in “opposition-party mode”. True, the Freedom Caucus are absolutists, but Mr Ryan is downplaying the scale of the crisis that his party faces. The politics of health care divide Americans. They expose gulfs between those who favour more redistribution or less. They split those who think adults should be free to choose lavish, skimpy or no insurance, from those who think that medical care is a right which government should guarantee. Mr Trump has spent months telling voters that such hard problems are easy to solve and that trade-offs can be avoided. In the case of Obamacare he promised to replace it with something “terrific” that would cost less and offer “insurance for everybody”. Populism collides with reality The plan written by Mr Ryan and endorsed by Mr Trump did not cover everybody. It created winners (the rich, the young and healthy) and a lot of losers (older, sicker folk, and most of the additional 24m people who, it is estimated, would be uninsured by 2026). Democrats and moderate Republicans from swing districts called it shockingly ungenerous, while hardline conservatives denounced it as another government handout. Rather than broaden its appeal, Mr Trump and Republican leaders made the bill more extreme to woo hardliners, stripping away rules stating that policies must cover such basic needs as hospitalisation or preventive care, including vaccines and cancer screening. When factions remained dug in, Mr Ryan and Mr Trump pulled the bill. Trump supporters cannot gloat. When called on to honour his health-care promises, the president lacked the patience to study his own plan and negotiate. Instead, reports have him asking aides: “Is this really a good bill?” even as he demanded a take-it-or-leave it vote in the House. When that failed, Mr Trump blamed the far right, while predicting that soon Obamacare “will explode”, forcing Democrats to help craft a replacement. The next item on Mr Trump’s agenda, tax reform, is just as divisive. Again the president brags that he will pull off “really fantastic” tax cuts that leave all sides happy—even as special interests and factions gather to prove him wrong. With a better man in the White House and a lot of luck this could be a remarkable moment, in which new coalitions are formed and political logjams broken. That moment is being squandered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:39:25.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
