Do you not think we’ve all got enough to do, without this?\nThe television streaming service has announced that it is to start giving viewers control of how programmes’ stories unfold – the principle of the 80s choose-your-own-adventure books applied to the small screen. It will launch a trial later this year with children’s shows based on an established character coming with these interactive storylines.\nCompany executives say that, with adult dramas, there could be branch narratives or different ways to connect different plot points using your remote. Actors would film multiple segments and it would be up to the viewer to put them together.\nPerhaps among the vast mass of the viewing public there are a few brave, adventurous and energetic souls who can greet this news with wonder and delight. Good luck to them. But I suspect the majority are exhausted by the mere thought.\nIt seems to me to misunderstand the fundamental appeal of television; that it is bedtime stories for grownups. You plonk yourself in front of the screen to be entertained. That doesn’t mean being fed pap (although it might sometimes, and that is what – thank God – Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is there for); contemporary television is increasingly a feast for the upper reaches of the mind as well as the primitive bits that would be just as happy banging a stick on a stone. But it does mean being presented with a finished product: a complete, satisfying entity with a beginning, a middle and an end (however many seasons it takes to get there). We want to cede control to someone else. We want to be taken inside their world. We want the creator to have done the hard work, shaping and polishing their vision, so that we don’t have to. We want to delight in revelation, not choose it.\nMore importantly, it will destroy relationships (and actors – imagine having to film multiple versions of everything. Where’s your integrity? Where’s your motivation, darling? Your entire working life is now just one big green screen). Think of the rows you already have about what to watch. Now imagine the rows you’ll have about which plotline to choose, which ending to have once this thing spreads. One of you will want Danny Latimer to be found alive, for Walter White to go into permanent remission, and for Alicia Florrick and Diane Lockhart to make up at the last minute and walk off into the sunset together, while the other will insist not. End of days.\nNetflix, this is not chill.\nNetflix Shortcuts Television features  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:36:19.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
