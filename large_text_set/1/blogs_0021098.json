It largely features suicide bombers in vehicles, including one young teenager who can barely see over the wheel of the armored car. ISIS uses drone photography to follow the suicide bombers and film the attacks from the air.\n(ISIS video screenshot)\nThe video uses photography from another drone to show a weaponized drone flying toward its target, and cameras on the weaponized drone itself show the impact from dropping an IED on a group of people in a street. When vehicles start to respond to the scene, a suicide bomber in a car drives in and detonates in a follow-up attack.\n(ISIS video screenshot)\nISIS continues to show a variety of other explosive drops from a drone's vantage point, mostly targeting individual parked vehicles or small groups of people.\n(ISIS video screenshot)\nThe blasts produced by the explosives are akin to grenades, appearing to inflict some injuries when aimed directly at people but seeming to have little effect when dropped on tanks.\n(ISIS video screenshot)\nA reporter and a cameraman for U.S.-funded Al-Hurra were injured last week in an ISIS drone attack on eastern Mosul.\nIraq's defense ministry announced that their forces are in control of eastern Mosul -- a city divided by the Tigris River -- and have begun planning operations to retake smaller but more densely populated western Mosul.\nIn mid-October, just after the Mosul operation began, Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky, commander of Combined Joint Forces' Land Component Command for Operation Inherent Resolve and commander of the 101st Airborne, told reporters that ISIS drones were in use.\nThe general described them as \"really, a lot of commercial, off-the-shelf kind of things we've seen\" -- though they're \"clearly not the capacity or capability\" that the coalition has.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2017/01/24/isis-unveils-weaponized-drone-program-in-new-video/", "external_links": ["https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/homeland-security/user-content/53/files/2017/01/isisdronevideo3.jpg", "http://aranews.net/2017/01/isis-drone-attack-injures-two-local-journalists-in-mosul/", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/homeland-security/user-content/53/files/2017/01/isisdronevideo1.jpg", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/homeland-security/user-content/53/files/2017/01/isisdronevideo4.jpg", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/homeland-security/user-content/53/files/2017/01/isisdronevideo5.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-24T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:08:56.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
