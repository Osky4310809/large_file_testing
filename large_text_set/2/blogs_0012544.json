Let’s talk, obviously, about the problem that is Paul George. \nLook, is he the Indiana Pacers’ best player? Yeah, he is. He’s the most talented Pacer of all time, and I mean that as no disrespect to Reggie Miller. There’s a difference between the best Pacer of all time and the most talented. Reggie’s the best. \nPaul’s the most talented. \nThat’s a problem right there. With his mixture of size and skill, George should be the best Pacer ever. He should be a top-10 player in this league, not far behind LeBron, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard and James Harden. He’s a top-10 talent, but a top-25 player. \nGeorge was saying after the Pacers’ 111-98 loss to Washington on Thursday night that he’s “going to bring everything and put everything I have into it,” but the numbers don’t show that. The numbers show an erratic scorer — he does other things well, none of them great — whose point total in the past five games has yo-yo’ed up and down. But more down: 31, 13, 27, 13 and finally 17 on Thursday. \nAll of that is a problem, but it’s not the problem today. Today, the problem is Paul George’s mind, his mouth and his me-first leanings that leave Pacers coach Nate McMillan in a tough spot. \nThe Pacers, who enter the All-Star break on a six-game losing streak, are missing their top two power forwards: Thaddeus Young and Lavoy Allen. Because of that, they’re playing two guys — Kevin Seraphin starting, C.J. Miles off the bench — ill-equipped for the position. Seraphin is big enough, but too slow. Miles is quick enough, but too small. \nMeanwhile, Paul George is just right. He’s not merely a potential power forward — he’s the prototype in today’s smaller, sleeker NBA that demands a combination of size, skill and speed from that slot. Paul George has all three. \nBut he won’t play the four. \nGeorge refused to do it last season, complicating Larry Bird’s offseason remake of what had been one of the league’s bigger, slower lineups. And McMillan indicated before Thursday’s game that George has declined to do it this season even now, with the Pacers missing two power forwards. This is what McMillan told me when I asked him Thursday: Any thought, on an emergency basis, of putting Paul at the four? \n“We’ve tried that, but Paul is …” McMillan said, then paused, unsure how to finish that sentence. Paul is … what ? \nMcMillan tried again. \n“Um, we’ve tried that some — but no,” he said. “I wish it was that easy, and it really should be, but it’s not.” \nIt really should be that easy? Man, that’s as close as you’ve ever heard any of George’s bosses — McMillan, Bird, former coach Frank Vogel — say what’s on everyone’s mind: \nPaul George is putting himself ahead of the team. \nGeorge says otherwise, of course. When I asked him Thursday night if he’d play the four, he said he would. Maybe. \n“It might get to that point of trying to stretch the floor,” he said, “trying to speed us up, try to bring something different, something new to this team.” \nThose are George’s words about playing power forward. These are McMillan’s: “That’s something he doesn’t want to do.” Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
