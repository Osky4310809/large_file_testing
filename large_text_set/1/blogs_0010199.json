LOUIS • Archbishop Robert Carlson on Tuesday urged aldermen to defeat a bill that would add “reproductive health decisions” to the city’s anti-discrimination ordinance. \nThe bill, filed on Dec. 2 by Alderman Megan-Ellyia Green, is pending before the aldermanic Housing Committee. No hearing has been set, but Green said she hoped there will be one within two weeks. \nHer proposal would extend protection against discrimination to include “any decision related to the use or intended use of a particular drug, device or medical service, including the use or intended use of contraception or fertility control or the planned or intended initiation or termination of pregnancy.” \nGreen proposes to do that by amending an ordinance originally intended to cover discrimination in housing and employment, and which has been expanded over the years to include the disabled, gay people and others. \nIts provisions include empowering the city Civil Rights Enforcement Commission to consider complaints. \nCarlson issued a statement Tuesday saying the bill “seeks to make St. Louis a sanctuary city for abortion,” and said it would have “terrible consequences for religious institutions.” Carlson said Catholic agencies could be fined for not employing persons who “publicly promote practices such as abortion.” Download PDF \nGreen said she filed the amendment to make it clear that women “should be free to make reproductive choices they want to make without consequences from their employer or landlord.” \nShe said she had no example of such discrimination in St. Louis, but added, “With a (Donald) Trump presidency and a Republican supermajority in Jefferson City, attacks on women’s rights are real.” \nGreen said her bill would not deal with anti-abortion protests nor limit a religious institution from firing an employee who takes a public stand for abortion. \n“We are not talking about political activity. We are talking about reproductive choice,” she said. Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nBe informed. Get our free political newsletter featuring local and national updates and analysis.
