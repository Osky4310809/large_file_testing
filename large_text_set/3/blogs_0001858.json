The latest lava-spewing event began on Monday evening.\nSEE ALSO: India's only active volcano is back from the dead after 150 years\nIn the video below, posted by Storyful, orange explosions of lava are seen spewing from the southeast crater.\nResidents in the nearby cities of Catania and Toarmina could see the lava show in the distance. Authorities reported no dangers to communities along the mountainâ€™s slopes, the Associated Press reported Tuesday.\nAt 10,900 feet high, Mount Etna is Europe's largest active volcano. The \"stratavolcano\" has a conical shape and is made from many layers of hardened lava, tephra, pumice and volcanic ash.\nThis Sicilian landmark also has one of the world's longest documented records of historical eruptions, dating back to at least 1,500 B.C.E. Smaller bursts have occurred regularly in recent years, though the last major event was in 1992.\nPlumes of smoke and ash erupt from Mount Etna on Oct. 30, 2002.\nImage: ISS/NASA/Getty Images\nDuring that eruption, as lava threatened to overtake a Sicilian village, U.S. marines lent a hand during the aptly named Operation Volcano Buster. A team flew helicopters over Etna and dropped concrete blocks at the edge of the lava tunnel to plug the hole.\nThe marines apparently didn't sweat it.\n\"Everything is easier when no one is shooting at you,\" Comdr. John Carpenter of the Navy told the New York Times from Sicily in 1992.\nLuckily, no soldiers were needed this time around.\nBONUS: Exploring volcanoes with robots: a day in the life of Carolyn Parcheta", "external_links": ["http://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=211060", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/hTmEYS7j.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/d6fYpoMhTTUiPuxyM874I2FGI6U=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F399300%2Faf73d509-003a-4ef0-a8d1-ed6b104cfa73.jpg", "http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/25/world/zafferana-etnea-journal-it-s-plug-up-mt-etna-or-go-the-way-of-pompeii.html", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/e3b26be62bf1439b970fdf64dafa47ab/etna-volcano-erupts-fiery-show-lava-eastern-sicily", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rV9rtKFZb_yQ1HdvmDF6TQaXSCM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F399300%2Faf73d509-003a-4ef0-a8d1-ed6b104cfa73.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/hTmEYS7j.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-01T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:35:16.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
