They’ve paired multiple cars with boats, including but not limited to the SLS , the G-wagen , the Vision GT concept , and the GT S in years past. This year, in celebration of a decade of partnership and 50 years of AMG, the two companies blended elements from the hard-core GT R with a 50-foot Marauder SS and displayed the result at the Miami International Boat Show. \n-Although one of these machines is for land and the other for sea, they have a few fundamental similarities: carbon-fiber construction, massive power, and a set-back cabin with a long front deck. According to Cigarette Racing, the use of carbon fiber is so extensive in the Marauder that the 2017 model was 1300 pounds lighter than the previous example. Adorning the lightweight body is an exterior color scheme by Daimler chief design officer Gorden Wagener that draws on the GT R’s Green Hell Magno coloring, which is itself a hat tip to the Nürburgring.\n- \n-“From the very beginning, we were confident that Mercedes-AMG would be the perfect partner, as our companies both take great pride in our triumphant racing heritage and maintain a steadfast focus on pushing the limits of performance,” Cigarette Racing CEO Skip Braver said. “It is now an extremely proud moment to celebrate 10 years of working together and demonstrate the strength of our collaboration with Mercedes-AMG by unveiling our most impressive high-performance boat yet.”\n- - AMG Brings a Car to the Boat Show with GT S and Matching Cigarette - Floating Fantasy: Cigarette Racing and AMG Collaborate on Vision GT Concept - Mercedes-AMG GT: Full Specs, Pricing, Reviews, Photos, and More - -The Mercedes-AMG GT R features a twin-turbo V-8 to make 577 horsepower. The Marauder has a bit more oomph. It uses two Mercury Racing 1550/1350 engines and M8 stern drives, making up to 3100 horsepower. Reminiscent of the now famous SRT Hellcat red key , the Marauder has two different fobs for two different levels of power. The Race key is good for a claimed 1550 horsepower with racing fuel, while the Pleasure key is for a more relaxed experience with only 1350 horsepower using 91-octane fuel.\n-You can bet that, pricewise, the AMG GT R represents the lesser half of this particular car-and-boat combination.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:07:14.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
