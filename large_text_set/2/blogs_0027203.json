The government would no longer be able to dictate this.   \nDisabledveterans.org noted that Shulkin’s other priorities included beefing up employee accountability and finally doing something about the high rate of suicides among veterans. \nShulkin, in an interview with Fox News, promised that he would be swift and harsh when dealing with VA employees who weren’t working up to the standards they should be, Military Times reported. \nTrump often floated the idea of full-blown privatization of the VA — which is something several prominent veterans’ groups opposed — but more recently he has seemed to settle on a sort of public-private VA system that gives America’s veterans the best of both worlds. \nHopefully Shulkin can enact this plan, and others, so America’s veterans finally get the care they deserve.
