Or, in Malcolm Gladwell’s case, big goals and great habits on the way to 10,000 hours.\nThat’s where International Elite Runner, Tina Muir , comes into our story. Tina is a professional runner, an olympic trial qualifier, community manager for Runners Connect , and host to a 5-star podcast, Run to the Top .

Schedule your time well Schedule your time well and organize your day. Do the little things that will help make your life easier. Like putting your alarm across the room or putting your phone upstairs so you’re not tempted to check it 24/7. That will help you focus a bit more when you are working.\n2. Automate where possible Automate where possible, but don’t lose the human element. People feel more loyal and passionate towards your company if they think you actually care, rather than just a way for you to make more money.\n3. Track what’s working and what’s not Use some kind of tracker, be it UTMs or a website, that helps to keep track of everything that is working and what isn’t working with your experimentation. Even just Google Analytics to help you see which campaigns are working and which ones can become habits that you can use over and over again.\nMentionable Quotes and Shareable Snippets \n\nYes, you might not reach that BIG goal, but you’ll probably going to reach a higher level than you ever would have if you kept setting these easy goals that were easy to reach.\n– Tina Muir\nShow Notes and Other Memorable Moments Thanks a million for checking out this episode!

And they both can seem very easy from the outside.” “I typically find that my best, most productive hours are working are those early morning hours when I wake up and then again in the afternoon between 12pm and 3pm.” “Setting blocks of time aside is a great habit for me because little aspects like that help me to focus on a single tasks, which actually helps save time in the long run.” “You want to be experimenting and trying new things because that’s where you’re going to be learning new things and could actually break it big. It’s those bold moves that will help us stand out in a world that is so noisy.” “In both areas of my life, goals are important. I think all too often people are afraid to set high enough goals – we get complacent.” “All of the little day to day goals that you can check off of your list make a big difference and add up over time.
