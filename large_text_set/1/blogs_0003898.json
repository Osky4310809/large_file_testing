Music will headline the first-ever Fyre Festival – coming to the private island of Fyre Cay in the Bahamas for two weekends this spring.\nSo hyped to announce my G.O.O.D. Music Family as the first headliners for @fyrefestival. Get tix now at fyrefestival.com. VIP access for my followers… use my promo code KJONFYRE for the next 24 hours to get on the list for the artists and talent afterparty on Fyre Cay. #fyrefestival \nA video posted by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Jan 4, 2017 at 2:11pm PST \n\nHowever, it’s currently unclear exactly who from G.O.O.D. Music will be performing—after all, the collective includes Big Sean, Pusha T, John Legend, Teyana Taylor, Tyga and Desiigner – in addition to Kanye, of course. Additional performers are expected to be announced closer to the event.\nSurrounded by some of the most beautiful water in the world, festival-goers will be able to enjoy activities like jet skiing, snorkeling and more—think Coachella but on a private island.\nTicket packages for the festival can be purchased online , but you better be sitting down before you start looking at prices. For solo travelers you’re looking at $1,595 USD; those traveling in pairs will spend $3,195 USD; and those with their own personal yachts (but, of course) will be paying $3,394 USD per person. There’s even an option for groups looking to rent out an “artist’s palace,” where the talent will be staying, for $50,000 USD per person.\nThe inaugural Fyre Festival will be taking place April 28-30 and May 5-7, so purchase your tickets soon if you plan on attending.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T03:05:10.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
