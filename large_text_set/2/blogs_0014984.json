Ever since the books came out nearly 10 years ago, many maps have attempted to show what Panem looks like.\nWe have some pretty strong data to back up certain states and regions to districts. Take Hunger Games lead character Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the movies). She lives in the fictional District 12 where jobs are based around coal. Based on the geography (so many hunting in the woods scenes) and weather (winter sounds brutal out there) laid out in the books it seems to be based on America's West Virginia area, or what some refer to as \"Coal Country.\"\nOther clues link District 8 to the cotton-growing South. The fancy Capitol is in the Rockies, so that makes it seem like its based on Denver, Colorado, or somewhere nearby.\nBut what about all the other districts? The Bureau is all about looking at what types of jobs people have in an area to figure out what industries are the main source of income and employment. Using some literary clues from the books and movies, the government data agency was able to pinpoint some strong possibilities of where each district is located.\nHere's all the districts and their industries.\nImage: U.S. BLS\nThey even did some math to figure this out. And you can too, they are eager to point out!\nHere's the full list of districts and their matching industries. The Bureau presents all this to show that data and stats can actually be fun and can help you figure out fictional countries in your favorite dystopian novels. So they supplied all the employment and industry data for regions that specialize in these Hunger Games- specific skills.\nDistrict 1: Luxury goods\nDistrict 2: Rock quarrying\nDistrict 3: Electronic goods manufacturing\nDistrict 4: Fishing\nDistrict 5: Power generation\nDistrict 6: Transportation manufacturing\nDistrict 7: Lumber\nDistrict 8: Textiles\nDistrict 9: Grain\nDistrict 10: Livestock\nDistrict 11: Crops\nDistrict 12: Coal mining\nSo get going on using government data and map out Panem once and for all. May the odds be ever in your favor.\nBONUS: If ‘Catching Fire’ was remade with no special effects, save for fire", "external_links": ["https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d7", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d6", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d5", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d4", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d3", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d2", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d1", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/2YoeY0Uz.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0vbBM--dj2QecqaTggfLpiuLNdg=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F387960%2F5bdc7852-d8c6-45d7-a003-d292c0880f71.png", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d9", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d12", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d11", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d10", "http://ew.com/article/2012/03/22/hunger-games-a-great-map-of-panem-photo/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SFZW1LQYfjsf7TnoIn7GKQ7P0Uc=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F387960%2F5bdc7852-d8c6-45d7-a003-d292c0880f71.png", "https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/hungergames_master.htm#d8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/2YoeY0Uz.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-19T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:33:06.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
