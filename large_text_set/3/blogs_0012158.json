Innovation and clean energy are key to solving both, ” she said. \nThe measure also acknowledges climate change is occurring, and that humans have been impacting the change. If unaddressed, the bill states, the effects could have “ the potential to adversely impact all Americans. ” \nThe impacts of climate change listed in the document include more frequent heat waves, more severe storms, worsening flood and drought cycles, water scarcity, and other significant weather events, all of which could affect productivity and saddle future generations with “ costly economic and environmental burdens. ” \nCurbelo, co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, said his state of Florida is “ on the front lines of climate change, ” according to a press release . \n“ South Florida residents are already beginning to feel the effects of climate change in their daily lives – from chronic flooding to coral bleaching to threats to our freshwater supply in the Everglades, ” he said. \nIn the past, many Republicans have either denied climate change is happening, or they have argued that humans are not causing it. \nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a “ hoax ” and said that “ global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. ” NBC News just called it the great freeze – coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2014 The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 \nRecently, the newly appointed head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Scott Pruitt said carbon dioxide is not “ a primary contributor to the global warming, ” a statement that his own agency denies. \nCurbelo said that Pruitt’s comments were “disconcerting” and “akin to saying the earth is flat in 2017.” \nA similar resolution was introduced by 17 Republicans in 2015 and several of them lost their seats during the last election. \nVia RT .
