The 2-in-1 convertible is priced at $499.\nSee also: How to run Android apps on your Chromebook July 14, 2016 As with the original Chromebook Flip, the 2.65-pound Flip 2 has a display that can move 360 degrees so that the Chromebook can be used more like a touchscreen tablet. The 12.5-inch screen has a 1080p resolution, along with an Intel 6th generation Intel Core m3 processor, 4GB of RAM that can be upgraded to 8GB, and 128GB of onboard storage. Oddly enough, the version of the Chromebook Flip 2 that was featured in the unboxing video was only supposed to have 32GB of storage. It’s possible ASUS may be selling another version of the same Chromebook with a smaller amount of storage space. Hopefully we will get confirmation on that soon.\nThe ASUS Chromebook Flip 2 also has two USB Type-C ports that can be used for charging up other devices along with transferring data. It also has a microSD card reader, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a battery that’s supposed to last up to 10 hours on a single charge. All in all, this seems like a decent notebook for the money, especially if you are a Chrome OS fan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:25:07.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
