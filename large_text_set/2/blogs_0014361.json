EFCC operatives \nAccording to the letter, “The said sum of N75 million was legitimately and legally transferred to Mike Ozekhome’s Chambers’ account from the same account from which Governor Fayose also withdrew N5 million on the same date, after the account had been defrozen and made operational by an order of the Federal High Court, Ado Ekiti, presided over by Justice Taiwo O. Taiwo. \n“In appreciation of the volatile mood of the nation, we have resolved to restrain our members and other concerned Niger Deltans from street protests or processions, which could inflame the already tensed religious, ethnic and political divides in our country.” \nWe hope our resort to peaceful expression of our anger through this open letter will not be misinterpreted as a tacit approval of the apparent vindictiveness of our esteemed son and brother who has defeated the EFCC over five times in court as attorney on behalf of his clients, in the last one year, with the latest case being in January, wherein the agency was indicted and ordered to pay the sum of N6 million as damages for its illegal arrest and detention of one Mr Sylvanus Okpetu.” \nHe has also fought against other tendencies deemed antithetical to law and order,” the group said.
