Schilling lost his job as a commentator at ESPN in April in part because of his presence on social media, including a viral posting that mocked transgender individuals. \n“There are some of the worst human beings I’ve ever known voting,” Schilling told TMZ about Hall of Fame voters. “There are scumbags.” \nAs CBS Sports reports, Schilling has received about 55 percent of the vote, according to a public ballot tracker focused on the Hall. Candidates need 75 percent to be inducted, so as the tallying of votes nears an end, Schilling’s inclusion in the list of new inductees on Jan. 18 seems unlikely. \nIn his first four years on the ballot, Schilling received 38.8 percent of the vote in 2013, 29.2 percent in 2014, 39.2 percent in 2015, and 52.3 percent last year, according to baseball-reference.com. \nSchilling spent 20 years in the MLB, and took home three championships — one with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001, and two with the Boston Red Sox in 2004 and 2007. He played for the Phillies from 1992 to 2000 and was part of the beloved 1993 Phillies squad . The former pitcher wrapped up his career in 2007 with more than 3,000 career strikeouts and a 3.46 ERA. \nWith that type of experience, many might consider Schilling an obvious choice for the Hall. However, as Schilling told TMZ, life is not always fair. \n“ Fair doesn’t enter into it,\" Schilling said. \"My dad told me, ‘When you turn 18 and leave the house, the word fair goes out the window.’ The world’s not going to treat you fair.\" \nSchilling still has faith in the democratic process, though. Earlier this year, he mulled over a run for president , and said he would challenge Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2018.
