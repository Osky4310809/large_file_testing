Add all of the base ingredients to your food processor and process until the mixture comes together. It should stick together but still retain some texture. Press the base into a large square spring form tin and place in the refrigerator while you make the filling. To Make the Filling: Place the persimmons in the bottom of your blender, then the coconut yogurt, lemon juice, coconut nectar, salt, orange zest, turmeric powder, and then the cashews on top- this will help make blending easier. Blend on high speed until very smooth and creamy, the liquid from the persimmons should be enough to get everything moving easily. Lastly, add the coconut oil and blend until mixed through. Pour the filling over the base and smooth out so it is completely even. Place the slice back in the refrigerator to set for 3-4 hours. You can top this with fresh slices of persimmon, chopped pecans, and serve with coconut yogurt and mint.
