It was supposed to be my year, but then the teeth implants didn't take and I became so low.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T16:41:16.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
