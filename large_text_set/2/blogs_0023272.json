It has just been one problem after another. There have been negative headlines at every turn and it is not as if the force doesn't have other crime fighting problems to deal with.\" \nA spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: “We can confirm that Supt Sean Memory is off work through sickness. Personal sickness absence is an issue that we would not comment upon further, due to the fact that it is a private matter between employee and employer. \n“Likewise we can confirm that Supt Sean Memory is currently under investigation for misconduct.\" Superintendent Memory is also the subject of a misconduct inquiry Credit: Ben Birchall/PA \nT he spokesman said while they would not comment on the nature of the misconduct investigation, it was not related to Operation Conifer or his work as a Senior Investigation Officer. \nThe spokesman added that the misconduct investigation was not a matter that would warrant Mr Memory's suspension from the force. \nThe appeal came after a retired police officer came forward with allegations that a 1992 trial featuring a brothel keeper had been dropped at the last minute when she threatened to expose Sir Edward as one of her clients. \nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) launched a probe into the claims, but it was subsequently established that the trial had actually been dropped because two of the prosecution witnesses refused to give evidence. \nDespite the cover up claims being debunked, Wiltshire Police, under the leadership of Chief Constable, Mike Veale, ploughed on with the sex abuse investigation. \nBut in his television appeal at the time Mr Memory said: \"What is important to me, is are there victims of sexual abuse from Sir Ted Heath, or witnesses and if so I would ask them to come forward today. I would actively encourage people to come forward and trust us.\" The investigation into Sir Edward Heath has been running since August 2015 Credit: Martin Cleaver \nW iltshire Police assigned a team of 21 police officers and staff to the investigation to dig for any evidence of wrongdoing, despite the fact the former Prime Minister has been died in 2005, aged 89. \nIn December, amid mounting criticism over the cost and progress of the inquiry, Chief Constable Mike Veale issued a robust defence, insisting that he was \"duty bound\" to investigate any allegations made. \nMr Veale denied it was a \"witch-hunt\", and said he would publish a report into the matter later this year. \nBut he has also admitted that the findings may never be made public as much of the information gathered during the investigation will have to remain confidential. \nThere have been mounting calls for the investigation to be closed down, but a spokesman insisted the force remained satisfied with its progress, despite the departure of Mr Memory. Police made an appeal outside Arundells, Sir Edward's former home in Salisbury Credit: Eddie Mulholland \nT he spokesman said: “It is very important that we stress there is no risk to Operation Conifer due to this set of circumstances. To ensure continuity in this complex investigation, it continues to be overseen by Assistant Chief Constable Paul Mills and has been, and will continue to be, subject to regular scrutiny through a Gold Group meeting structure which reviews actions and activity. \n\"The Force has every confidence in how the investigation has been conducted to date. Supt Steve Kirby (an experienced investigator who has worked on this case from the outset) has been appointed as SIO for Operation Conifer. \n“The experienced and highly skilled investigation team will continue to investigate fairly, objectively and proportionately, without fear or favour, seeking to provide the public with confidence in the police response. \n“The proportionality and justification for the investigation remains under constant review, assisted by an external scrutiny panel. It has also been subject of an independent review by Operation Hydrant.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:12:49.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
