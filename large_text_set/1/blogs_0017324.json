The speakers, which already are labeled as “Chromecast built-in” (formerly known as Google Cast) will be adding support for both the digital assistant-based Google Home speaker , as well as Google Multiroom support, sometime before the end of February.\nSee also: Google Cast branding is being ditched for ‘Chromecast built-in’ November 23, 2016 Both of these new features will be available via an over-the-air software update, according to an LG support note. The company launched its Music Flow speaker lineup in 2015, but many of its owners have been waiting for the promised Multiroom update for some time. The support note stated that LG has been working with Google on that update, and decided to throw in Google Home support at the same time. The note added this update will be available for both older and more recent Music Flow speakers.\nWhen that update is available, Chromecast users will be able to cast music to multiple Music Flow speakers at once. The Google Home support should also allow users to control playback, volume and other aspects on those same speakers with voice commands.\nLG’s speakers aren’t the only products getting Google Home support, though. Earlier this week, VIZIO announced it has added Google Home support to its lineup of SmartCast devices , including its smart TVs, soundbars and other products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T03:07:02.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
