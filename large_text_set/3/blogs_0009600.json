Most Popular By Emma Dibdin Mar 10, 2017 Is Sean Spicer okay? The White House press secretary sparked some concern during today's White House press conference, during which he wore his American flag pin upside down. It was almost certainly an accident—Spicer is no more a stranger to wardrobe malfunctions than his boss —but an upside-down flag is an officially recognized sign of distress . According to Yahoo's White House correspondent Hunter Walker, Spicer was handed a note alerting him to the error by Omarosa Manigault, and quickly fixed his pin—though it took him a couple of tries.   After being handed a note, it took Sean Spicer two tries to fix his pin.
