Known as the Lenovo Smart Assistant, the device runs on Amazonâ€™s Alexa software and features a similar tube-like design with a lower price tag.\nThe Smart Assistant arrives with an Intel Celeron N3060 processor with a 5-watt tweeter and one 10-watt woofer for audio playback. The top half of the device is silver while the bottom half has a woven fabric design which comes in several colors.\nThe Smart Assistant is compatible with the Alexa app and other third-party smart home devices, but differs from the Amazon Echo in its price structure. Lenovo has also introduced two versions of Smart Assistant, a standard version which costs $129 and a Harmon Kardon audio version said to offer superior audio performance for $179. The standard version of the Amazon Echo costs $179.99.\nSee also: Amazon Echo can now answer follow-up questions similar to Google Home 4 days ago Meanwhile, Lenovo also announced a 6 TB networked hard drive named the Smart Storage box.
