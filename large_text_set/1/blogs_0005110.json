He checked himself in last month just days after his divorce from Khloe Kardashian was finalized. Odom has been battling substance abuse for a long time and was comatose after an overdose in 2015.\nHe walked out of the San Diego facility and said the experience was “awesome” and “life-changing.” He also said he’d like to start a reality television show and he plans to speak with his ex-wife. The reason Odom went to rehab in the first place was because of his stint on the reality show The Doctors . \nEXCLUSIVE: @RealLamarOdom is out of rehab and we were there to capture the moment! #TheDoctors https://t.co/JoFuhfUeCY pic.twitter.com/xetCe4NYcW \n— The Doctors (@TheDoctors) January 5, 2017 \n\nOdom was encouraged to get help because of the show and will probably detail his rehab experience there. An interview will air January 17 , which is probably why he didn’t say too much about the rehab experience with the TMZ cameras around.\nHopefully better times are ahead for Odom.\n( TMZ , The Doctors )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T19:30:10.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
