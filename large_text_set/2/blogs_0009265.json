The first cohort, to be based in London, kicks off this April. \nNoteworthy is that startups joining the InMotion Accelerator will receive “bespoke” investment in exchange for equity. In other words, this isn’t a one-size-fits-all accelerator programme. The idea is to allow funding to be determined “according to the needs of each venture”. \n“InMotion Ventures works collaboratively with its startups to provide the right amount of funding, with the right terms, on a case by case basis,” says Jaguar Land Rover’s venture arm. \nIn addition to funding, startups enrolled in the programme will receive office space, mentoring from successful startup founders, support from InMotion Ventures’ in-house finance, operations, marketing, design and development teams, access to Jaguar Land Rover’s network, and more. \nIn a statement, James Nettleton, Head of Accelerator at InMotion Ventures, says: “New technologies and consumer needs are transforming the way we move. This rapid change creates a unique opportunity for startups to build hugely valuable businesses, and we’ve designed a programme to help them do just that.” \nSebastian Peck, Managing Director at InMotion Ventures, adds: “We’re looking to match world class mobility and transportation startups, to our dedicated team of entrepreneurs, designers and technologists – all experts in mobility and eager to work tirelessly to support growth.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:54:21.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
