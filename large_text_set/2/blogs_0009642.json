The Valentine’s Day thing was just given to me, but I’d do this show any day. I probably only think about Valentine’s Day as much as the average guy does.” \nAudiences expecting to hear the same kinds of dating tales and partying jokes they might’ve gotten from the native Texan a few years back may be in for a bit of a surprise. In her growth from Last Comic Standing winner to comedic relationship expert to the world’s leading user of the fried shrimp emoji, Iliza’s also taken it upon herself to go deeper. \n“As a comedian, you always want to be evolving and hope that your audience is evolving with you,” Iliza says. “It’s really hard to watch myself – only a psycho would enjoy watching old DVDs of their comedy – but I look back and see things that were really fun and smart for where I was in my life, but now I think if you don’t stand up for yourself and say something meaningful in your comedy, it can be kind of a wasted platform. Now, I look forward to seeing how wrong I feel about that statement in five years.” Related Stories How Nick Thune Became Comedy's Creepy Youth Pastor \nBut Iliza’s evolution is about more than just empowering women and dropping her last name for a singular moniker — it’s also about finding a way to stand out and make comedy that’s worth watching in the vast sea of content known as the internet. As someone who’s had success with shows and specials on every platform from network TV to online streaming services, Iliza understands the current challenge facing comedians these days, big name and small. \n“Comedy is so hot right now – and it has been for a couple of years – that it’s kind of a blessing and a curse,” Iliza says. “You have so many avenues for comedy with networks investing in web series and all of these alternative channels looking for comedy shows that it gives a chance to comedians who weren’t necessarily a network’s top three picks for a comedy special. On that same token, it generates so much content that it creates a tougher battle to get seen. You have people who make six-second videos of them getting hit in the crotch on Instagram and they’re making a million dollars a week.” \nIliza isn't directly competing with social media stars specializing in nut shots, but she’s also built a uniquely dedicated fanbase. Not only does Iliza’s audience watch her live shows, standup specials and ABC web series Forever 31 , but they make posters and T-shirts, and bring homemade (or store-bought) gifts to the meet-and-greets the comedian hosts after each live performance. \n“Human beings are naturally very selfish, so for people to stop and take time and money out of their busy lives not just to watch me perform but also to meet me and bring gifts for me, it’s humbling – and I’m not humbled by much,” Iliza says. “It’s not just touching that my comedy touched them, but that they want to express their love. I look forward to it as much as they do. It’s not like I’m curing cancer. I’m just doing standup.” \nWhile Iliza may be one of comedy’s fastest rising stars, she’ll always have competition for the headlining slot of her own show. Ever since being introduced to the masses in 2013’s War Paint special, the comedian’s adorable rescue dog, Blanche, has found her own way into the hearts of many. As many relatable jokes as Iliza has come up with over the years, it’s tough to rival the emotional attachment some of her diehards have for Blanche. \n“We do these meet and greets, and everybody comes up and says ‘I’m excited to meet you, but I’m really here for Blanche,” Iliza says. “She’s definitely put on some weight, so I’d say it didn’t go to her head as much as it went to her butt. Like here’s this rescue dog that I got just to have some company on the road, and to see people embrace my pet like their own pet is a special thing. Seeing how people react to my dog that I love so much, I think it gives a certain softness to my comedy. I’m sharing a part of my heart, my dog, my opinions, and I think my fans are very caring, nurturing and receptive in that regard.” Upcoming Events", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:04:23.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
