BREAKING: Footy McFooty Face is leading the online Facebook vote for San Diego's MLS club name. pic.twitter.com/6rTXRwxYeC â€” NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) March 24, 2017 \nIn second place, is the respectable and realistic name, 'San Diego Surf.' Rounding out the top three is none other than the 'Bad Hombres,' thanks to President Trump's use of the phrase. \nThen there are the basic, or shall we say boring, names like San Diego Football Club, San Diego Soccer Club and Athletic Club San Diego. \nWhen it's all said and done, we can all assume the name won't actually be the Footy McFooty Face, but at least Soccer City SD brought attention to their ambitions of joining MLS.
