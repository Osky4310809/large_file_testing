The Browns may as well just move on with Gregg Williams as the head coach! Mar 14, 2017 6:08 AM \nhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha \nis it april fools day already…. \nwhat a bunch of morons ace24xx says: Mar 14, 2017 6:12 AM \nHahahahaha Mar 14, 2017 6:12 AM \nThe Sadness Factory is in full production Mar 14, 2017 6:14 AM \nToo funny, and this why Clevrland are the Browns. poison66 says: Mar 14, 2017 6:19 AM \nOswieler the starter in 201!, I can’t wait to lmao at the Brownies again Mar 14, 2017 6:21 AM \nIf that is there three choices he is probably their best option. It would be ironic if he did well there and the Jets sign Josh McCown. joedirte4life says: Mar 14, 2017 6:23 AM \nThey must really want that USC QB next year rowech44 says: Mar 14, 2017 6:24 AM \nIf I’m a Browns fan, especially a season ticket holder, I wouldn’t be happy to hear a Jets castaway could be the next starting QB… let’s hear from some Browns fans – What do you think they should offer Pats for Jimmy G to try to get it done??? Would you mind seeing the #1 pick go??? I’m curious to hear some Browns fans opinions on the issue… uopclod says: Mar 14, 2017 6:24 AM \nGeno Smith… $1MM talent with a 10 cent head. If he only had a brain. officialgame says: Mar 14, 2017 6:25 AM \nThe amount of press the Cleveland Browns get every off season is ridicules. Who cares? Until proven otherwise the way they go about team building is flat out stupid. They passed on Carson Wentz for what amounted to an extra #1 pick and bragged about it afterwards. Still without a QB they come up with a guy who is not only a lousy QB but a bad person to boot. Mar 14, 2017 6:29 AM \nWow dawgturd says: Mar 14, 2017 6:30 AM \nLow risk high reward move. Sign him, let him compete, he probably won’t make the final roster anyway, but what’s the harm in seeing what he’s got? Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member?
