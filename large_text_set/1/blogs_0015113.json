Just last week, Lefty O’Doul’s announced it was closing in Union Square following a landlord dispute. \nCrogan’s closure revealed the strenuous, long-running relationship it had with the city of Walnut Creek. Some of the details were hinted at in the bar’s recent Facebook post. \n“Unfortunately, the city has made it clear that they have very specific ideas in mind for what Walnut Creek should be and Crogan’s no longer fits into their narrative. Ultimately, we have been forced to close our doors,” the post reads. \nIt all can be traced back to last year when Walnut Creek authorities said the bar was a public nuisance, according to NBC reports . Police responded to more than 700 calls there in the last four years — a number the bar’s owners disputed. \nThe city then set mandates forcing the bar to stop selling alcohol at earlier times — news Crogan’s also posted on their Facebook page. Last call in 2017 was set between 11:45 p.m. and 11:50 p.m. with the space closing at 12:30 a.m. Sunday through Saturday. \nIn the end, it looks like the restrictions made the business untenable. \n“Crogan’s is all our family has known and we’re heartbroken to see it come to an end the way it has,” the Facebook post reads.
