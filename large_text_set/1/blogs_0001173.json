Some succeeded, but others failed. In some cases, marketing departments of some companies went into overdrive and puffed up mediocrity in an attempt to attract customers towards otherwise bland products. People were holding their breath too often, only to find out that it was not really worth it.\nSo, our question to you is,\nWhat was the biggest disappointment of 2016? Which mobile OEM, product, or service were you initially excited for, only to be disappointed in the end? Did you purchase/try the product and come to the conclusion, or were your expectations dashed based on something else? What should have been improved in the product or service, to make it worthy of your money and time?\nLet us know in the comments below! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T02:05:41.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
