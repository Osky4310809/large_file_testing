By rights, this should be an unremarkable and uninteresting document. That is no criticism of Mrs May, simply an acknowledgement of the fact that Mrs May has already set out her plans in great and convincing detail in a powerful speech just last week. She has a plan, and it is known to anyone who took the trouble to listen to her.\nSo it is curious, to say the least, that a number of MPs, mostly Labour but also SNP, Liberal Democrats and a few Tories, made such great play of demanding a White Paper. It is also notable that most of those MPs opposed Brexit and wish Britain to remain closely entangled with the EU after we leave. Unsurprisingly, some Brexit-backers suspect the White Paper demand is just one of the ruses Remainers might use to block Britain’s path to the exit door that voters have so clearly chosen.\nWith her sensible, straightforward decision, Mrs May has effectively called the bluff of those demanding a White Paper. What will they do now? Perhaps some have perfectly honourable motives. Perhaps some really have no desire to impede the process of Brexit and merely wish for a fuller debate about the Government’s strategy.\nWatch | Starmer: We welcome the PM's U-turn over Brexit White Paper 01:28 I f so, they should prove it by joining that debate on the same terms as Mrs May: by offering a comprehensive vision of Britain’s future relationship with the EU. If, for instance, these MPs believe Britain should retain full membership of the single market, let them say so openly, and debate publicly what that would mean: continuing to accept the free movement of EU nationals and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Instead of hiding behind parliamentary manoeuvres such as demanding a White Paper, let them explain their European policy to the voters who have overwhelmingly demanded a different immigration system and an end to the power of European judges.\nThis burden of proof lies most heavily on Labour. Laughable as it seems, Jeremy Corbyn leads Britain’s alternative government. If Labour wants to keep Britain in the single market, to continue with free movement and remain subject to European law, let Mr Corbyn say so clearly, and let voters judge him accordingly.\nBy setting out her plans, Mrs May is leading the way on Brexit. Will those who are attempting to oppose her have the courage and honesty to follow her lead?", "external_links": ["https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Theresa+May+will+publish+a+White+Paper+telegraph&gws_rd=ssl"], "published": "2017-01-26T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:28:26.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
