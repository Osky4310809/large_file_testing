The following six documents which you can show as an identity proof are Driving Licence, Voters’ Identity Card, Passport, PAN Card, Aadhaar Card issued by UIDAI and NREGA Job Card. You need to submit any one of the following documents as a proof of identity. Except for PAN, most of the documents also contain your address details. Therefore, that can also be accepted as ‘proof of address’. If the document submitted by you for proof of identity like PAN card does not contain address details, then in such a case you have to submit another valid document which contains address details.
