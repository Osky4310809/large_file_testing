And well, Melo doesn't take his attempt to show him up too kindly. Felipe Melo wins the ball with a tough tackle \nAs the ball makes its way over his head, Melo turns and sprints towards it, blocking off his man. \nHe goes into the challenge hard but fair - presumably so he doesn't try anything cheeky again. \nBut just to be sure, Melo goes a step further by 'letting him know he's there'. \nNow anyone who has played Sunday League football will know that there are a number of ways players can let someone else 'know they're there'. Once an enforcer, always an enforcer (Photo: Dean Mouhtaropoulos) \nMelo's way is quite unique though and simply involves him standing over the fallen player and screaming in his face. \nCheck the referee's reaction afterwards as he sheepishly wanders towards Melo and tells him to calm himself down... he doesn't dare issue a card. \nWell would you?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:34:45.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
