Photo: Jim Merithew/Cult of Mac \nApple Watch Series 3 will ship with a new display technology as Apple looks to move away from the “touch-on-lens” (TOL) panels it adopted for Series 2. \nNot only are TOL displays more expensive than alternate solutions, but Apple’s manufacturing partners are struggling to produce enough to meet demand. Apple is instead expected to switch to “glass-film” displays for its next model. \nApple has been using TOL panels for less than a year; they replaced the “glass-on-glass” displays that were utilized in the original Apple Watch. However, the curved cover glass Apple uses for its wearables makes manufacturing TOL panels more difficult. \nSo difficult, in fact, that one of Apple’s biggest manufacturing partners, TPK Holding, lost money on TOL panel production last year. It is now said to be giving up on the technology entirely and moving away from Apple Watch manufacturing. \n“In order to return to profitability, TPK will focus on 3D sensor-based touch panels for smartphones with OLED displays in 2017 and give up production of touch panels for Apple Watch,” reports DigiTimes , citing sources in Apple’s supply chain. \nAs a result of this, and the low yield rates of TOL displays, Apple is expected to adopt glass-film panels manufactured by General Interface Solution or Biel Crystal Manufactory for Apple Watch Series 3. Shipments will reportedly begin in the second half of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:06:13.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
