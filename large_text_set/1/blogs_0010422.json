Brexit could push UK universities 'off a cliff edge', report warns \nPresenting evidence to the committee, industry experts said while Britain’s departure from the EU could provide new opportunities to improve research funding and international collaboration, a so-called hard Brexit would be damaging for the sector. \nAlistair Fitt, vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes University told the hearing that Brexit “would probably be the biggest disaster for the university sector in many years”. \nJohn Latham, vice-chancellor of Coventry University, said it would make British universities “extremely uncompetitive”. \nCatharine Barnard, EU law professor at the University of Cambridge, added: “It promptly cuts off the flow of excellent people who are coming at the moment.” \nThe hearing follows months of concern from top academics and education leaders, who argue the reputation of Britain as a hub for quality research and higher education courses could be damaged irrevocably as a result of the referendum vote. What experts have said about Brexit What experts have said about Brexit 1/11 Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond \nThe Chancellor claims London can still be a world financial hub despite Brexit “One of Britain’s great strengths is the ability to offer and aggregate all of the services the global financial services industry needs” “This has not changed as a result of the EU referendum and I will do everything I can to ensure the City of London retains its position as the world’s leading international financial centre.” Reuters 2/11 Yanis Varoufakis \nGreece's former finance minister compared the UK relations with the EU bloc with a well-known song by the Eagles: “You can check out any time you like, as the Hotel California song says, but you can't really leave. The proof is Theresa May has not even dared to trigger Article 50. It's like Harrison Ford going into Indiana Jones' castle and the path behind him fragmenting.

The world will want to screw you – that's what happens in trade talks,” he said. “They have no interest in giving the UK a deal on trade” Getty 4/11 Tim Martin \nJD Wetherspoon's chairman has said claims that the UK would see serious economic consequences from a Brexit vote were \"lurid\" and wrong: “We were told it would be Armageddon from the OECD, from the IMF, David Cameron, the chancellor and President Obama who were predicting locusts in the fields and tidal waves in the North Sea\" PA 5/11 Mark Carney \nGovernor of Bank of England is 'serene' about Bank of England's Brexit stance: “I am absolutely serene about the … judgments made both by the MPC and the FPC” Reuters 6/11 Christine Lagarde \nIMF chief urges quick Brexit to reduce economic uncertainty: “We want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack of clarity feeds uncertainty, which itself undermines investment appetites and decision making” Getty Images 7/11 Inga Beale \nLloyd’s chief executive says Brexit is a major issue: \"Clearly the UK's referendum on its EU membership is a major issue for us to deal with and we are now focusing our attention on having in place the plans that will ensure Lloyd's continues trading across Europe” EPA 8/11 Colm Kelleher \nPresident of US bank Morgan Stanley says City of London ‘will suffer’ as result of the EU referendum: “I do believe, and I said prior to the referendum, that the City of London will suffer as result of Brexit.

The adverse winds could quickly pick up – and merit a stronger policy response. But recently they have shifted to a more favourable direction” Getty \nSpeaking at Pembroke College on Wednesday, vice-chancellors emphasised that reassurances were yet to be made from the government over the future of funding for university research, as much of this comes from the EU. \nConcerns were also raised over early indications that the number of prospective EU students choosing to study in the UK might fall as a result of Brexit – a loss that could cost the UK economy more than £690m per year. \nApplications from across the European Union have already dropped by 14 per cent at Cambridge University for undergraduate courses alone, MPs were told. Neil Carmichael MP, Chair of the Education Committee led the hearing at Pembroke College, Oxford \nSpeaking to the committee, Professor Barnard said: “This year we have seen at Cambridge a 14 per cent reduction in the number of applications from the European Union at undergraduate level, although I should say the number of applications from EU students at postgraduate level are up. \n”In respect of those who have declined an offer from Cambridge at postgraduate level, we have put a question in the so-called decliners survey to say 'what was it that dissuaded you from coming?' \n“Those who answered the question offered a range of factors from a concern about anti-immigrant sentiment to devaluation of the pound and the fact that their scholarships would be worth less, although obviously not in the UK, and uncertainty over future research collaboration.” \nWritten evidence published by the House of Commons Education Committee in recent weeks highlighted concerns from 190 individual groups within the sector, following an inquiry into the impact of Brexit. Theresa May denies 'muddled thinking' over Brexit \nCambridge University’s submission warned the Brexit could push the reputation of UK universities off a “cliff edge”, leading to “serious repercussions” should academics be denied free movement and required to apply for visas. \nAt the hearing, Prof Fitt pointed out that the UK does not necessarily win from EU research and innovation funding pots it contributes to. \nHe said: “European structural funding is very important for the UK but the UK, I believe, doesn't get as much out of it as they put in. \n”Structural funding can also come with quite a few strings attached, can come with quite a few risks and can be quite hard to manage. \n“So, if we were able to replace the amount of structural funding with our own funds, that's a real opportunity that we could not only retain all that's best in that system, but actually make it an even better system.” \nAlastair Buchan, head of Brexit strategy at the University of Oxford, said the sector had been hit when Britain joined the EU. \nHe said: “One of the things that we did lose was that nice and easy flow of clinicians and clinician science from Canada, the US, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Home Office to slash international student visas by nearly half \n”We had really good collaborations, which hopefully in this Brexit climate might be reinvented, because that movement of English-speaking medicine was actually a casualty of joining Europe.“ \nOxford is setting up a Brexit observatory to collect data on the impact of quitting the EU, he said. \nEngineering Professors' Council president Stephanie Haywood said Britain would still need to employ thousands of engineers from Europe to fill the gap of 40,000 graduate staff in the industry. \n”We're doing lots of things to try to encourage more people to take up physics and STEM subjects, we're trying to get more women into engineering, but I don't see these things being very quick fixes and I think it's going to be very difficult to fill the gap other than by recruiting engineers from overseas, and that includes the EU.“ \nProf Haywood also pointed out that only 30% of PhD students in engineering are British and the industry is ”heavily reliant“ on postgraduates filling high-end jobs.
