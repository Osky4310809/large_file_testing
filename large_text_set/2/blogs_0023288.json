According to the team, the new car strikes a right compromise between downforce and aerodynamic resistance, while meeting the new regulations imposed. \nUnlike Mercedes-AMG Petronas’s W08 EQ Power+ , the “shark fin” on top of the Ferrari’s engine is by no means discreet in its appearance, similar to other 2017 F1 cars like the Renault R.S. 17 , Sauber C-36 Ferrari and Force India VJM 10 . Nonetheless, the car is wider, lower and fitted with wider tyres as per 2017 rules. \nOther cues include the complex aero appendages ahead of the air intakes on the unusually shaped sidepods, thumb-tip nose, mini wing on the fin and a redesigned engine air intake roll-hoop just behind the driver. The car’s livery also gets tweaked to accommodate the new engine cover, with the fin being painted white, while the majority of the car is in Rosso Corsa . \nPower will come from a 1.6 litre turbocharged V6 that revs to 15,000 rpm, and is mated to an eight-speed semi-automatic sequential and electronically-controlled gearbox with quick shift. The car’s front pushrod and rear pullrod suspension setup also gets an update, while the power-steering and braking systems have been upsized. \nNo change in the team’s roster, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen returning to pilot the SF70H for the upcoming season.
