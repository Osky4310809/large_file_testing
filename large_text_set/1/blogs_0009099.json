Surveillance footage captures images of the suspect in a shooting of an Foreign Service Officer in Guadalajara, Mexico, Jan. 6, 2017. Photo courtesy of the Official Facebook of the Consulate in Guadalajara \nThe victim, who was also not identified, was recovering from what Secretary of State John Kerry called a \"heinous attack\" in a statement on Sunday. \nThe officer was shot on Friday in Guadalajara. Later that day, the American consulate there released a video of the shooting that showed a man in dark blue shirt and pants waiting near a security gate. As a black car pulls up to the gate — and with someone sitting on a planter just feet away — the man points a gun at the windshield and fires. Then he turns and runs. \nIn a statement on its Facebook page, the consulate had said the FBI was offering $20,000 for information that could help identify the suspect. It was unclear if someone would be eligible for that reward. \nGuadalajara is Mexico's second largest city and an economic powerhouse in a region wracked by violence. \nIn 2015, a powerful local cartel controlled roads, killed 25 police officers in a two-month period and shot down a military helicopter, according to a U.S. State Department report.
