Blige announced her new album Strength of a Woman , along with the fact that it featured a stellar list of guest artists that included Kanye West, Missy Elliott and Migos’ Quavo. Now Blige has shared the track featuring Kanye, and it is titled “Love Yourself.” Listen to it below.\n\n\nUsing a rich brass instrumentation, the song extols its core virtue right there in the title; self-love. Blige demonstrates that her vocal chops are still in top form, while Kanye delivers a surprisingly intimate verse, one that focuses on his come-up. “I decided not to use my color as a handicap,” he spits before handing things back over to the formidable Blige.\nStrength of a Woman will be Blige’s first full-length since her live compilation The London Sessions . It is out on April 28 via Capitol Records.\nIn other music news, Kendrick Lamar has just dropped a video for a new song titled “Humble.” Watch it right here . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:43:17.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
