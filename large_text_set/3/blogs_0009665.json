Our health and fitness is multi-faceted,” he continued. “The best indicator is how well you feel in your body.”\nA story about the scale removal in the campus newspaper, The Charlatan, quoted a student supporting the step, saying scales can be “triggering,” especially for someone with an eating disorder.\nIn online forums, the reaction was not exactly sympathetic. “Great policy,” one wrote. “Next up, ban calculators because I’m flunking calculus and seeing them triggers me.”\nAnother said the scale “had it coming” because it was a terrible liar. One suggested the centre should also ban mirrors.\nOthers lamented the loss, calling the scale “a useful tool.”\n“No one is forced to step on a scale, just like no one is forced to use the squat rack. It’s an unfortunate decision to remove a useful tool that all gyms should have.”\nRelated Experts say pollution of modern life is depriving us of a sense of smell, making us eat more junk food Cancer rates will climb nearly six times faster in women than in men thanks to obesity, U.K. study says Health Canada probes weight -loss company selling pregnancy hormone amid revival of debunked diet There are other ways, Marshall wrote, to track fitness progress.\n“If you need a number to focus on in regard to reaching certain fitness goals we suggest using girth measurements,” he suggested to exercisers. “You can start by recording measurements in multiple areas, for example your torso, hips, chest, legs and arms. You would then revisit these measurements after a few weeks to keep tabs on your progress.”\nHe also had suggestions on how to measure cardio patterns.\n“If you have cardio training goals we suggest keeping track of your resting heart rate moments after you wake up in the morning. When the heart rate starts to lower you know you have been able to improve on your cardiovascular capacity. You can also perform a program on a cardio machine and take note of your performance (average heart rate, distance, time, etc.) and after several weeks of training you can re-test the same program to compare your progress.”\nThe same is true with strength improvement, he wrote.\n“If you have strength goals, try not to keep track of your bodyweight but rather the weight that you are lifting in different exercises each week. Occasionally look back at those previous weeks to see just how far you have improved or which areas might need a bit more focus. We often forget to acknowledge just how far we have come.”\nNot without a sense of humour, Marshall said the centre may reconsider its decision. But first? “We will weigh the pros and cons.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T01:05:36.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
