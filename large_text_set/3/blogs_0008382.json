ADVERTISEMENT \n“Naiwan niya yung envelope na may lamang pera (Our staff left the envelope that contained money),” Revillame recalled. Fortunately, a baggage clerk named Victor rushed to the crew to return the envelope, which contained P34,000 and a few dollar bills. \nRevillame appreciated his kind gesture and rewarded Victor and his daughters by handing his signature jackets, mobile phones, and P10,000 cash for Victor’s youngest daughter, a college student taking up medical technology.

It’s a good thing na nangyari sa amin ito para nakikita sa buong mundo na may mga Pilipinong tapat sa paglilingkod sa kanilang trabaho (To the NAIA leadership, people like [Victor] should be given a medal. It’s a good thing that this happened to us so the whole world will see that there are Filipinos who truly serve in the course of their work),” Revillame said. \nLast month, the cast of “Wowowin” were in the UAE capital to tape an episode and entertain thousands of Filipinos working there.
