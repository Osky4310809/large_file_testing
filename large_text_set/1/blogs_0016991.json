Southampton’s late goal sinks Norwich as José Fonte edges closer to exit Read more \nRonald Koeman, the Everton manager, who coached Fonte at Southampton is also an admirer of the defender. Saints could command as much as £12m for a player who has 18 months left on his current contract. \nFonte was again left out of Southampton’s squad for the FA Cup third-round replay win against Norwich City on Wednesday. Claude Puel, the Southampton manager, admitted that the Euro 2016 winner was weighing up “opportunities” to leave the club he joined in 2010 from Crystal Palace. \nThe 33-year-old, whose last appearance for Southampton came in a defeat at Everton this month, has submitted a formal transfer request and will be allowed to leave St Mary’s in this transfer window. \nFonte has made 19 appearances for Southampton this season but did not feature in any of the club’s six Europa League matches, much to the frustration of the defender. \n“I think he has some opportunities, he studies his opportunities and for Southampton it is the same,” Puel said of Fonte on Wednesday. “We will see if José leaves or no, we will see over the next few days.” \nBilic, the West Ham manager, is keen to bolster his defensive options with Angelo Ogbonna, Winston Reid and James Collins his only recognised central defenders. West Ham remain keen on the Brentford striker Scott Hogan, as well as Hull City’s Robert Snodgrass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T12:07:45.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
