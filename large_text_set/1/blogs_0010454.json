Indeed, Amazon counted “just” 30,000 U.S. employees in 2011, a figure that jumped to 180,000 by the end of 2016.\nThe positions span the full spectrum of roles Amazon has on offer, from entry-level warehousing positions to software engineers. However, the company does stress that “many” of the positions will be to staff its new fulfillment centers that are currently being built in California, Texas, Florida, and elsewhere.\nCrucially here, the company is keen to sell itself as a nationwide employer, rather than one that’s centered around its headquarters.\n“These jobs are not just in our Seattle headquarters or in Silicon Valley — they’re in our customer service network, fulfillment centers and other facilities in local communities throughout the country,” said Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. “We plan to add another 100,000 new Amazonians across the company over the next 18 months as we open new fulfillment centers, and continue to invent in areas like cloud technology, machine learning, and advanced logistics.”\nThe timing of this announcement is notable as it comes just days before Donald Trump is due to takeover as president of the U.S. Indeed, in the build up to his inauguration, Trump has touted plans to boost the U.S. workforce with millions of new jobs. After meeting with the president-elect, Jack Ma, head honcho at Chinese tech titan Alibaba, promised to create a million jobs in the U.S. over five years. This followed shortly after SoftBank pledged to create 50,000 jobs.\nWhile Amazon was going to create these new positions anyway, irrespective of who the next U.S. president was going to be, it’s telling that Amazon would choose to make this announcement just as Trump is about to takeover at the White House.\nBezos and Trump have never seen eye-to-eye , but Amazon is one of the biggest employers in the U.S., and the company wants the incoming president — and the country on the whole — to remember that.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T17:24:33.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
