The Democratic attorneys general filed an amicus brief. \n“The executive order has already generated confusion, disappointment, and fear,\" said Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh in a statement Monday. \"It is not only a policy that is unwise and dangerous, but it is a policy that is inhumane, inappropriate and un-American.\" \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that the administration is \"absolutely not\" thinking about withdrawing the order and will fight the matter in court. \n\"We're not rethinking our strategy at all,\" Spicer said. \"What we're discussing now has nothing to do with the merits of the order...This is just purely on the injunction that the judge issued.
