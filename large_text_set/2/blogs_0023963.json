King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 10 hours ago 12 \nLars Ulrich was recently asked by The Ringer whether \"there's one quintessential live Metallica song,\" to which he replied: \n\"I would say this: The one song we never rehearse is ' Seek and Destroy ,' and that's one song we always play live. \n\"So I would say that makes it the quintessential live Metallica song because it's only ever played live. 'Seek and Destroy' is basically in every show, and that's the song that kind of has the most life. \n\"It's always different, there are different raps, different things. It's loose; it's crazy. It's a little loopy. So to some extent, it is the quintessential live Metallica song. \n\"It was the show closer for probably around a decade or so, which is pretty crazy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:15:22.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
