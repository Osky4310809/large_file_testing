By Jesse Paul | | The Denver Post PUBLISHED: March 26, 2017 at 2:27 pm | UPDATED: Colorado appeals court says state must protect health and environment before allowing oil and gas drilling \nUnites Airlines says its internal policy led a gate agent at Denver International Airport on Sunday morning to bar two young female passengers wearing leggings from boarding an airplane to Minnesota in an episode that drew outrage on social media. \nThe girls, according to the airline, were “pass travelers”— people who are family or associates of United employees — and thus, as indirect or direct representatives of the company, must follow a dress code. \n“There are pass travel requirements that we remind all of our employees to review before they go to the airport,” United spokesman Jonathan Guerin said. The passengers this morning were United pass riders who were not in compliance with our dress code policy for company benefit travel. \n— United (@united) March 26, 2017 \nUnited has no rules barring general passengers from wearing leggings on flights. \nCasual attire generally is allowed for pass travelers, according to Guerin, but the attire “of this particular pass rider did not meet the rules.” Flip flops are apparently another type of clothing that pass travelers are barred from wearing. \nGuerin declined to release the internal dress code for pass travelers. \nThe incident set off a firestorm on Twitter early Sunday after Shannon Watts, founder of the gun control advocacy group Moms Demand Action, posted about the girls not being allowed to board. 1) A @united gate agent isn’t letting girls in leggings get on flight from Denver to Minneapolis because spandex is not allowed? \n— Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 26, 2017 1) 3 girls inspected for wearing perfectly acceptable leggings. 2 not allowed to board. I don’t care what kind of passengers they were. https://t.co/9VwGKgvWys \n— Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 26, 2017 2) This behavior is sexist and sexualizes young girls. Not to mention that the families were mortified and inconveninced. \n— Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 26, 2017 \nWatts, who lives in Colorado, said “I don’t care what kind of passengers they were … this behavior is sexist and sexualizes young girls.” She said the girls’ leggings were not inappropriate and that she witnessed the ordeal. \n“As the mother of 4 daughters who live and travel in yoga pants, I’d like to know how many boys United has penalized for the same reason,” she said on Twitter. Spoke with a @united spokesman. He said incident at @DENAirport stemmed from a “pass traveler” whose attire did not meet company rules. https://t.co/zQcTSRF9xd \n— Jesse Aaron Paul (@JesseAPaul) March 26, 2017 \nFueling the controversy were initial United tweets in response to Watts that lacked context in which the airline said it “shall have the right to refuse passengers if they are not properly clothed via our Contract of Carriage.” \nSeveral media outlets also posted stories online that initially lacked the pass traveler information or comment from United. \nOther airline passengers said on social media that it’s not unusual for pass travelers to be barred from wearing leggings, or other barred clothing, on flights. @dwaynebenji As you aren’t a pass traveler, your attire doesn’t need to meet the United pass travel clothing requirements. See you soon. ^AH \nTwitter said on Sunday afternoon that United was trending on its site after “being hit with backlash for leggings controversy.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:17:18.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
