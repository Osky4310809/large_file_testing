Jenna Jameson BLISTERS Bruce Springsteen and his ‚ÄòAmerican embarrassment‚Äô Posted at 9:44   Sam J. \nAs Twitchy reported, Bruce Springsteen acted like a total doorknob in Australia, shaming America during his performance and going so far as to claim he was an embarrassed American. \nRemember when Springsteen sang about being born in the U.S.A.? Now he‚Äôs embarrassed by it? \n*sigh* \"We stand before you embarrassed Americans tonight. This is a song from 1965 by The Orlons. We're gonna use this to send a letter back home\" pic.twitter.com/dRptUmu6Ht \n‚Äî Bruce Springsteen (@springsteen) February 4, 2017 \nWha? Why should Americans be embarrassed for protecting our borders and making our safety a priority? Just more drivel from an elite who is completely out of touch with not only everyday Americans, but reality. \nJenna Jameson was fed up: Listen you knob, WE are not embarrassed to be Americans, WE are embarrassed you're showing your ass.
