How Pinnick beat noisy Neighbour Anjorin! On 5:20 pm In News , Sports by adekunle Comments \nFrom Tony Ubani in Addis Ababa NFF’s President, Melvin Amaju Pinnick has won a place in the CAF Executive Committee thereby becoming the third Nigerian to occupy that position after late Etubom Orok Oyo Orok and Dr Amos Adamu. \nIn climbing to the exalted position, Pinnick crushed loquacious Anjorin Moucharafou from neighboring Republic of Benin 32 to 17 votes. \nAmaju’s victory crowned all his efforts as the pioneer of a new generation of African football administrators having plotted the downfall of septuagenarian Issa Hayatou who reigned as CAF president for 29 years. \nThe victory of the Nigerian which was celebrated by majority of African football administrators also put an end to the era of Hayatou as most of his cronies failed to get elected in the CAF Executive board. \nInterestingly, Anjorin who described Pinnick as a small boy who was in a hurry to eat the food of elders was so lonely in the crowd. Amaju, no doubt becomes one of the youngest African football administrator at the age of 46 years. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T18:07:11.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
