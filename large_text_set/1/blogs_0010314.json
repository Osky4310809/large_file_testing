The tournament, which is honour of the late Federation International de Football Association (FIFA) President Granatkin, has 16 teams in participation ver four groups, where India is placed in group B. \nThe German coach opted to start with the likes of Stalin Sanjeev, Amarjeet Kiyam, Suresh Wangjam, Boris Singh and Mohammed Rakip to name a few. \nThe outset of the brutal pummeling in the Baltic City began in the 4th minute, when striker Glushkov was afforded time and space to power home a looping ball past the Indian goalkeeper. \nThe junior Sobornaya doubled their lead barely eight minutes later when pandemonium in the Indian box allowed a Russian attacker to shoot at goal, whch hit the post and rebounded into play. Denisov was well positioned to convert an easy tap-in. \nTwo would then become three in the space of nine minutes. A superb through ball cleaved the Indian defense and handed second striker Glushenkov a one-on-one with the goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, a move he finished with a delightful lob. \nThe carnage exacerbated barely four minutes later, when Rudenov mate it 4-0, with a smarty finished move. The 31st minute saw Glushenkov add his second to the score-line and fifth overall for the Russians, as the teams went into the half-time interval with a scoreline that read 5-0. \nThe second-half began with Russia accounting for their sixth goal, as superb wing-play allowed striker Tsypchenko to tap-in with ease. \nSeventh hell beckoned for the young Colts, under fire on all fronts of defense, when the same scorer headed in a corner in the 70th minute. \nThe drubbing, overseen by Mikhail Galaktionov - Russia's U18 coach - was completed by Latchevic in added time of the second-half. An imperial scoreline of 8-0 read the scoreboard, as the Indian U17 team, scheduled to participate in the U17 world Cup later this year, were expunged in the former imperial capital. \nThe Indians will now face Belarus' U17 representatives, on Tuesday, 10th January.
