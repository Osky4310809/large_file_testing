The more likely to keep you up at night theorizing the better. From the looks of things, Hulu wants a piece of that pie, and is laying down the gauntlet with the first trailer for Dimension 44 . \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter , the six episode anthology series “draws inspiration from the internet’s notorious ‘404’ error code and aims to evoke the feeling of wandering onto the weird side of the web at 3 a.m., stumbling upon stories that cannot be explained in the world as we know it.” This first trailer looks suitably weird and intriguing, although to be fair, a cast that includes a narrating Mark Hamill, Patton Oswalt, Megan Mullally, Sarah Hyland, Joel McHale, Lea Michele, Robert Buckley, and Constance Wu would have won our eyes sight unseen. \nHonestly, it’s surprising that a show about the “weird side of the internet” hasn’t been made yet. While a late night web browse usually ends up on stuff like pimple popping videos and Wikipedia wormholes about the bizarre habits of our nation’s presidents, a meditation on the darker side of technology is at least a timely message. Whether they’ll manage to distinguish themselves from the brilliance of Black Mirror remains to be seen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T08:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:39:31.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
