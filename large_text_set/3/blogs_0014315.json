Simon’s collaborative genius—which calls on Los Lobos, Zydeco legend Good Rockin’ Dopsie, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo—invented a new musical language and earned a 1987 GRAMMY® for Album of the Year. The fractured narratives and emotionally fragile characters are unforgettable—whether it's the divorcé and his kid en route to Graceland, the unattainable girl with diamonds on the soles of her shoes, or the soft-in-the-middle hero of “You Can Call Me Al.\" Customer Reviews by Katstounding Being a child that grew up in a large family with grandparents a 5 hour car trip away I appreciate this album as the only one all of loved! One of my all-time favorites by Eric Coffey I remember listening to this album when I was a child, played by my parents who were Paul Simon fans. I still enjoy it today. My younger brother was named after \"Under African Skies!\" I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Simon at my job, and even though it is very discouraged, I made it a point to tell him how big of a fan I was of him in general but especially this album.

Rising to fame in the mid-'60s, Simon's songs were mature and literate, but also melodically engaging, and spoke to the concerns and uncertainties of a generation. As the 1960s gave way to the '70s and '80s, Simon's work tended to focus on the personal rather than the larger world, but he also expanded his musical palette, and helped introduce many rock and pop fans to world music.
