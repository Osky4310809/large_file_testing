Please read this very important message in full and share and encourage parents to attend Thursday, as well as sign the petition. As most of you have heard, Mr. Loffek is retiring at the end of this school year. Luckily, Ms. Julian will become a Principal. However, the District will decide if she becomes Gemini's 2017-2018 Principal or if they will place her at another school next year instead. Gemini needs Ms. Julian to step into the role of Principal next school year. The alternative is we start a new school year with BOTH a new Principal and Vice Principal. We are a tight knit community and so I am asking for your support this Thursday! Please come and help us convince the district we need to keep Ms. Julian at Gemini! We as parents have the opportunity to provide input on the selection process. Please join us at Gemini Elementary this Thursday, March 30th @ 5:30 pm. We will be meeting with Mrs. Taylor, Director of Elementary Programs with the District Office. If you are unable to attend in person, you can still help by signing this petition.If you have any questions you can email Taj Rothblatt at president@geminipto.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:18:20.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
