Flickr/Sébastien Avenet\nThere's nothing worse than hitting a destination during peak travel season, which can mean massive crowds and overpriced hotels.\nOften, the off-season — or even better, shoulder season — can be the best time to visit a place.\nWe teamed up with KAYAK to find the best international destination to visit each month of the year.\nKAYAK looked at some of the most popular international destinations, and calculated the median monthly airfare and hotel rate . Activities and weather were also taken into consideration.\nHere's the best place to visit every month of the year.\nView As: One Page Slides JANUARY: Cartagena, Colombia Shutterstock/Jess Kraft Median airfare: $397\nMedian hotel: $168\nJanuary is the cheapest time to fly to Cartagena, and just so happens to be the month Storyland, a 3-day festival that features the world's biggest DJs, takes place.\nFEBRUARY: Martinique, French Caribbean Shutterstock Median airfare: $521\nMedian hotel: $137\nIt's cold and you understandably want some sun. Head to Martinique, where February is low rain season and sunny skies beckon. Even better, Martinique's currency is the euro, meaning you can make the most of its favorable exchange rate, and the fact that you can get good deals even when booking last minute.\nMARCH: Medellin, Colombia DC_Colombia / iStock Median airfare: $454\nMedian hotel: $75\nMedellin was crowned South America's best destination , and made our list of 50 best places to travel in 2017 .

According to KAYAK, booking six months out will likely provide you with the lowest airfare.\nAUGUST: Tokyo, Japan Unsplash Median airfare: $948\nMedian hotel: $156\nVisit Tokyo before it hosts the 2020 games, and prices go up.
