By Jeffrey Matulef   \nOculus VR co-founder and one-time Time Magazine cover story Palmer Luckey is leaving the company he helped create. Palmer Luckey. \nAs reported by UploadVR , Luckey's last day with Oculus VR's parent company Facebook will be tomorrow, 31st March. \nFacebook wouldn't say whether Luckey's departure was of his own accord or whether he was forced out, though it did offer Upload VR the following statement on his leaving: \n\"Palmer will be dearly missed. Palmer's legacy extends far beyond Oculus. His inventive spirit helped kickstart the modern VR revolution and helped build an industry. We're thankful for everything he did for Oculus and VR, and we wish him all the best.\" \nLuckey became a controversial figure in recent times, and not just for his perplexing penchant for flip-flops. In September Luckey was outed as making a $10k donation to pro-Trump organisation Nimble America . The VR inventor apologised for how his actions reflected the company, though he stayed mum on his feelings regarding Trump and Hillary Clinton. \nShortly after this, Luckey was suspiciously absent from Oculus' press conference last October, though Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg took center stage, revealing his surreal vision of VR's place in social media . \nThings got worse for Luckey in February, when he was ordered to pay $250m to Zenimax for false designation and breaching a non-disclosure agreement, though Oculus is planning to appeal the ruling.
