Bryan Cranston, James Corden and Giovanni Ribisi battle for Jessica Biel’s heart in a new goofy Late Late Show sketch. As part of the on-going “The Bold and the Lyrical” series, dialogue entirely comprised of Kanye West lyrics has been used. Kanye West’s “Monster,” “Heartless,” “Gold Digger” and “All Falls Down” are all referenced in the sketch. At one point the scene comes to an awkward stop when Cranston by mistake tosses out the only Drake lyric, instead of a Kanye West lyric. Watch the fun sketch in the video here above.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T10:50:48.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
