The reusable tape allows you to stick LEGOs onto nearly any surface, making anything from the refrigerator to monumental floating concrete blocks a potential place for a LEGO creation. \nLEGOs have been transitioning into the fine art world for years, from Ai Weiwei's LEGO portraits of political prisoners installed in Alcatraz to Olafur Eliasson's minimalist interactive LEGO architecture on New York City's High Line. LEGOs have been used to recreate the work of Piet Mondrian , construct catwalk-ready masks , and emulate Depeche Mode and Daft Punk . LEGO art mirrors the world's most iconic films, from Star Wars and Mad Max to Ghostbusters and The Grand Budapest Hotel . Even particularly creative scientists have used the toy to study plant growth . Nimuno's tape could be the biggest advancement for LEGO enthusiasts since LEGO Technic . \nOn its Indiegogo page , Nimuno advertises the kinds of problems artists and other LEGO builders will be able solve with Nimuno Loops. \"Imagine being able to build around corners, on curved surfaces, or even onto the sides of that sailing ship you've just spent hours building. You forgot to engineer a point of attachment for that sweet dinosaur-smashing cannon? No problem. Snip a length of Nimuno Loops, stick it on the hull, mount your cannon and be on yarr way.\" \nNimuno Loops are also compatible with other building toys like Mega Bloks.
