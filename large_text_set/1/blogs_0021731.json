That of Ore Oduba . Unless you’re an avid viewer of telly sports (we’re, um, not) you could be forgiven for wondering who he was and thinking he’d be voted off early for lack of a strong following. Well, it just goes to show what we know. \nThe 31-year-old BBC sports presenter, who got back from anchoring the Rio Olympics one day and started his dancing ‘journey’ the very next, had never danced before, and when Melvin Odoom and Tameka Empson were the first two celebs to leave and a racism row erupted, things didn't look promising for Ore. \nYet he got the first 10 of the series for his amazing jive in week three, broke down, made us all fall for him a little bit with his weekly sobbing, and, ultimately, picked up that prestigious glitterball. \nNow he’s on tour, taking that famous jive to arenas around the country. We meet at his hotel after a long day’s training with the Strictly massive (fellow finalist Danny Mac and his girlfriend are at the other side of the bar) and a 6am start to sit on Piers Morgan’s lap on Good Morning Britain. \nYet he’s ever so chipper, terribly friendly and powers through our chat with the help of a lager top and a substantial portion of calamari (he claims he shouldn’t because he’s ‘put on some timber’ over the holidays, but if you’re going to dance for 10 hours, it’s very much allowed in our book). \nOre, who married wife Portia in 2015, clearly loved his dancing experience so much he can’t stop telling us about it, and even when we turn the conversation to other matters, he brings it back to the wonder and magic of Strictly Come Dancing… Ore Oduba and Joanne Clifton are crowned the winners during the final of 'Strictly Come Dancing' (Photo: Supplied by WENN) Read More Strictly's Karen Clifton claims Will Young never explained why he quit Strictly: 'I'm STILL not sure' \nIt’s been a month now since you lifted that glitterball. Has it sunk in yet? \nIt really hasn’t. I need to watch it back and make sure it did all actually happen. It’s right up there with my wedding as the best day of my life. It was bonkers. Just doing the show was the dream. The first time I went in to the studio, I stood there for about 10 minutes taking it all in, like a kid who gets to be the mascot at the FA Cup Final. \nHave you had a chance to have a nice cup of tea and a sit down after all that jiving and foxtrotting for months on end? \nWe went to Malaysia over the Christmas holidays, but I didn’t let go. I spent most of the time doing Strictly reviewing. \nReally?! Didn’t you want to just switch off? \nExcuse me, it was one of the best experiences of my life, I wasn’t just going to go, ‘Well, that’s cool, bye!’ There was one day on holiday, I just spent the whole time going through my phone looking at all the pictures I’d taken. I wanted to make sure I remembered everything, even the ‘remember when you were awful learning that dance and then you actually got through it’ stuff. I didn’t cry, though, I managed to hold up. \nOh, the tears. They couldn’t be held back could they? \nThose tears… There were no crocodiles there, every single drop was real. I didn’t see them coming. I remember my dance partner Jo (Clifton) was getting a little emotional towards the end of the week when we did the American Smooth to Singin’ In The Rain and I was thinking, ‘What are you tearing up about? Come on!’ But once it was done, I just felt this wave of emotion, and there was no going back after that. \nSo do you cry at everything? \nGetting married, I cried all day long. But Strictly has really opened my emotional artery. When I cry, it pours. \nWhat are you going to be like when you have kids? \nJust get the mop out, there’s going to be a flood. Imagine me at the Nativity play. Oh God, don’t. Just put me near the fire exit. \nSo we know you found Strictly emotional, but was it also terrifying? \nThe first couple of weeks were OK, because we had three weeks to learn the first dance and no one was leaving. But absolute panic set in when I only had four days to learn the cha-cha for week two. I spent the first hour just going, ‘We haven’t got time!’ If I’d been there 24 hours a day it wouldn’t have felt like enough. I was crippled with fear. \nYou really committed, though… \nI wanted to make sure I was the best I could be. I didn’t even have loo breaks. There was one day where I realised at 10.30pm that I hadn’t peed all day. What is wrong with me? I even blocked out bodily functions. It was like, ‘dance is the only thing for you now’. \nAnd you’d never danced before… \nI’d pulled out a few moves at my wedding, but there was no Latin or ballroom to be recognised in those particular shapes. No, it was all so alien. Ore and wife Portia (Photo: PA Wire) \nWhen did you start to think ‘maybe I can win this’? \nLook at my face when I got that first 10 of the series. The jive was my favourite dance, the judges gave me amazing comments and that was when it all started getting blurry around the eyes. Then you start leading the way and you’re like, ‘I’m not very comfortable up the front, I’m just one of the family.’ \nAre you bereft now it’s all over? \nIt feels like I’ve lost a leg. The day after the show ended I watched a montage a fan had put up of mine and Jo’s time on the show and, yes, I was in bits. It’s been your existence for four months, then it just drops off a cliff. I think I’ll just live in Elstree Studios, lurk about backstage and just pop up on the live shows. \nAre you all keeping in touch? \nIt’s a very mushy atmosphere on the show. The WhatsApp group is still going strong. Jo is a friend for life now. And me, Jo, Danny (Mac), Lou (Redknapp) , Kev (Clifton) and Oti (Mabuse) became really tight, we had such a bond. It’s the most unlikely group of mates you meet on that show. I mean, I never thought I’d be going on tour with Ed Balls . \nAnd you’ve ‘dumped’ Jo in favour of her sister-in-law, Karen Clifton, for the tour… \nJo was always going off on a tour of Thoroughly Modern Millie at the same time as the Strictly tour, we knew that from the start of the series. As the weeks went on, it got sad to think we couldn’t do it together, but that’s life. I’m keeping it in the family with Karen. Jo had a chat with her about me – I’d like to have been a fly on the wall for that. They even did our routines together over a glass of wine at Christmas. \nHow are you finding becoming a household name? \nStrange. The world is spinning. The reactions I’ve had from people have been amazing. \nHave the ladies been throwing themselves at you? \nI would not know. There’s only one woman for me… The reactions from men have been great, actually. There was a friend who messaged me saying he’d watched every one of the shows and was going to surprise his wife with dance lessons. And kids as well, boys who’ve decided to learn to dance instead of taking up football.

In the downstairs loo? \nThe original glitterball with all the 14 winners engraved on it resides at Strictly HQ. But there’s a slightly smaller replica, which currently rests at my in-laws’ house. I was there over Christmas and they’re babysitting it, which my mother-in-law is loving. It’s showed off to everyone who visits as soon as they’re through the front door. \nWe hear rumours of a £500,000 bidding war between BBC and ITV over you? \nIs there? Why aren’t they speaking to me? Why, when there are real wars going on, are they talking about this? But it’s very flattering. \nBut the offers must be flooding in… \nOf course you’re aware that the profile of Strictly is huge and it’d be naïve to think it wasn’t going to change things, but I didn’t have a plan. I don’t know where it could lead. I did This Morning as a guest and the next thing I know they’re asking me to host it. Sport is the only thing I’ve ever known. I’m enjoying the ride and looking forward to seeing where it leads. \nCan you describe yourself for us in three words? \nCrikey. Sleepy. I do like to sleep. I can sleep anywhere. What’s a word for saying you like to laugh a lot? Sleep a lot, laugh a lot. And driven, I’m very driven.

I suck it in if I’m annoyed. \nWhat makes you angry? \nPeople who stop abruptly in the street right in front of you. You’re walking and they just stop right there. Put your hazard lights on, or that’s how we get a collision. And dirty bathrooms. I do have a little compulsive/obsessive thing going on. I like things in a certain way in a certain order. \nWhat are you scared of? \nBirds. I don’t know why I hate them. Seagulls, pigeons and those little jumpy ones you get near your feet on holiday. Bats, too, and I’ve even been known to run from a moth. \nWhat’s been your most embarrassing on-air moment? \nOn This Morning they put a huge parrot on my arm. I could’ve wet myself, I was so petrified. The Speakmans were trying to help me overcome my fear. I only held it together because I was on TV. \nThe Strictly Come Dancing 10th Anniversary Live Tour is on until 12 February.
