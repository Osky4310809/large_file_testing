Bush and later renewed in 2008 under President Barack Obama . As an Indiana congressman at the time, Vice President Pence was an advocate for PEPFAR’s passing. \n“Twice on the House floor you defended that,” Bono told Pence. “That’s how we know you.” \n“It was an extraordinary historic accomplishment and you played a leading role in carrying it forward,” Pence responded.

The critics claim that Pence’s defunding of Planned Parenthood , which was one of the few places in some parts of Indiana that offered HIV testing, as well as his alleged dithering on pushing forward a needle exchange bill to fight passing infections, led to a rise in HIV patients in Scott County. He eventually approved a bill for needle exchanges which led to a reduction in the number of HIV cases. \nRELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack \n“I appreciate the chance to get together for you for a minute,” Pence told Bono. “I heard you were in town.” \n“You’re the second busiest man on earth,” Bono joked. \nAfterwards, the Pence tweeted about the meeting. “Enjoyed chatting w/ Bono at @MunSecConf,” he wrote . “Discussed prior effort to twice pass Africa AIDS assistance & future security in developing nations.” \nThe Munich Security Conference marks Pence’s first trip overseas as vice president.
