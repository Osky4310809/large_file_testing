Ugwuanyi’s victory No victor, no vanquish: Enugu youths jubiliate over Gov. Ugwuanyi’s victory On 3:27 pm In News by Nwafor Polycarp Comments \nYouths in Enugu State on Thursday stormed major streets of the coal city in celebration of the Appeal Court judgment affirming, Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, as winner of the 2014 PDP governorship primaries. \nThe youths under the auspices of Concerned People of Enugu and led by Mr Emmanuel Jonathan, were drawn from across the state including higher institutions. \nThe group converged on Okpara Square and marched through Presidential Road and adjourning streets chanting solidarity songs. \nJournalists report that the youths carried placards some of which read: `No more distractions’, `Time for good governance’, `Sen. Ayogu Eze support Gov. Ugwuanyi, we are brothers’, `No victor, no vanquished’. \nJonathan told newsmen that the victory had put to rest the dispute with Sen. Ayogu Eze. Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State \nEze was declared winner of a parallel primary election in November 2014, prior to the 2015 general elections. \nJonathan said that the judgment was a big relief to residents of the state who were happy with the leadership style of the governor. “We have been worried but this judgment has liberated us. \n“We want to appeal to the governor to continue with his good governance because the people are happy with his people-oriented and all inclusive leadership style. “That is what democracy is all about,” Jonathan said. Ayogu Eze \nJonathan said that with the victory, they would use the platform to mobilise support for the governor. \nJournalists report that the Court of Appeal in Abuja in its judgment on Feb. 15 affirmed the governor as the authentic winner of the PDP 2014 primary elections in the state. \nEze had gone to court on the ground that the parallel primary election that returned him as winner was conducted with the authentic PDP delegates’ list while the one used to return the governor was forged.
