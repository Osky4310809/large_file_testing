Personal trainer, 20-year-old Courtney Black, agrees weightlifting is the answer to killer curves. Instagram \nThe curvy model claims lifting more weights and doing less cardio will help you achieve the curves many celebrities have. \nShe talked to MailOnline about the misconception and said, \nIgnore the popular squat challenges. There is no way you’ll ever get a Kim Kardashian butt by doing 100 squats every day. \nIt doesn’t make you magically grow a bum as a lot of online challenges will have you believe — all it does is burn some calories. Courtney Black: 'don't just rely on squats' to grow your curves   Black changed the way she worked out and began embracing her curves after people on Instagram told her she looked like she was “dying” from being so skinny. \nShe commented on her past exercising habits and said, “I love my curves now and I’m truly ashamed of how I used to eat and exercise.” Instagram To help women better understand her how to work out in a healthy way while simultaneously sculpting curves, she talked about three main ways to get that hourglass shape. Why Celebrity Diets Are Bullshit   Her first tip is the easiest: EAT! \nShe said in order to gain curves during a workout, you must eat substantial meals consisting of protein and carbs because you “won’t get a sculpted bum by living off salad and leaves.” Instagram Black’s second tip is to “band up” during a workout to increase the resistance and intensity. Last, but not least, she said lifting weights is the main exercise that will land you a bod like the Kardashians. \nBlack said, \nNo one gets maximum results from running on a treadmill. You need to be lifting weights to get that curvy Kardashian physique. \nGrowing your legs and upper body whilst keeping you waist slim through weight lifting is what celebs do to create that hourglass shape. If you’re worried about bulking up like a man while weight training, have no fear. \nBlack made it clear female’s don’t produce testosterone like men do, and lifting weights won’t bulk them up like it would for a dude. Instagram \nSo there you have it. \nIf you want a butt like Kim Kardashian, quit your salads and your squats and start lifting weights. \n  CITATIONS MailOnline MailOnline", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:03:52.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
