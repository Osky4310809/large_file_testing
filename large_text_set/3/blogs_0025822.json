The league is considering loosening the penalties against excessive celebrations, which would be a move a lot of players would appreciate. \nNew Green Bay Packers tight end Martellus Bennett, however, wants the league to educate its players on life, not on how to have fun. We're developing an educational training video for players to show clear examples of appropriate and inappropriate celebrations. pic.twitter.com/3yzBxAaQuk \n— Troy Vincent (@TroyVincent23) March 21, 2017 \nHe went on a small rant Wednesday night on Twitter responding to the league putting together an educational video on how players can celebrate. Yea An educational training video on celebrations? Spend that money on something else like a video on investments or something that https://t.co/xabCzeRqYO \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) March 22, 2017 Let the players express their individuality and creativity. Y'all gonna make an educational video on how we should talk next? https://t.co/xabCzeRqYO \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) March 22, 2017 An educational video on appropriate celebrations. Not signing up for that class. pic.twitter.com/6oNMf5oZFM \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) March 22, 2017 \nHe even compared the NFL to the NBA in the way that each organization promotes its players. The NFL, Bennett says, focuses on promoting logos, not the players wearing them. See the NFL promotes the logos not the players. The NBA promotes its players. Big difference. \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) March 22, 2017 \nSo what will Bennett be doing when the NFL shows this educational video about appropriate and inappropriate celebrations? Doing his business, apparently. I'm going to be taking a 15 minute dump whenever we're supposed to watch this \"educational\" video. I can feel my stomach bubbling now \n— Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) March 22, 2017 \nNever change, Marty B.
