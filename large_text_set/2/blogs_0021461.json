Meanwhile, bars in two new Nicki Minaj tracks have fans speculating that the beef is back on. \nTwitter users say that Minaj has subtly attacked her Bronx counterpart on Jason Derulo 's \"Make Love and Gucci Mane 's \"Swalla.\" \n\"I gave these bitches two years, now your time’s up/Bless her heart, she throwing shots but every line sucks,\" she raps on \"Swalla.\" On \"Make Love,\" she goes, \"I’m the iPhone, you the Nokia/Everybody know you jealous, bitch it’s so clear.\" \nThough Remy told The Breakfast Club she doesn't deal subliminal shots, fans think that she's dissing Nicki on Phresher’s “Wait a Minute” remix. \n\"Get rid of those fake breasts/And put a vest on this bitch chest,\" she spits. \"That ghostwriter bout to call her/That lifeline getting shorter.\" \nFor some Twitter fans, the fact that Nicki thows shots at an unnamed platinum-winning female rapper on \"Make Love\" is proof that the beef is alive and well. \n\"Oooohhh, oh you the qu-e-e-the queen of this here?/One platinum plaque, album flopped, bitch, where,\" Nicki says. \nRemy Ma and Fat Joe 's \"All The Way Up\" was certified platinum. Though nothing is for certain, the Plata O Plomo emcee has proclaimed herself the Queen of New York. Besides, the two rappers were beefing before Remy's six-year stint behind bars. \nHere are some of Twitter's best beef theorists. Remy took shots all year and Nicki coming back swinging. Idc what nobody say this was about REMY. \"One platinum plaque..\" Iggy had 3, Remy 1 — B7 COMING 2019 (@LEGENDARYJOJO) February 24, 2017 Interviewer: do you think you shoulda just stayed in Prison and not dissed Nicki Minaj", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:15:13.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
