There was the epic Champions League implosion against Bayern Munich. A dreadful worst-ever run of form which put paid to their title hopes. The constant presence of the #WengerOut campaign. Alexis Sanchez hinting at a move to rivals Chelsea. \nNow in a further blow to Gooners everywhere, one of their biggest fears/complaints/frustrations (delete as applicable) with the club has been confirmed. \nArsenal are the most injury-prone team in recent Premier League history. Hurts to hear, doesn't it? (Photo: Arsenal/Getty) \nThe proof is indisputable, after a Sky Sports study of the 11 ever-present teams from the 2011/12 Premier League onwards has revealed the total days of injured players in that period. \"I'm holding my leg, but actually I just needed some more hair gel\" (Photo: Arsenal FC via Getty Images) \nSince August 2011, the Gunners have seen their players be out of action for an enormous 10,285 days - over 700 (almost two years!) more than their nearest injury rivals Manchester United. The Red Devils have suffered 9,600 days worth of injured players. Debuchy in pain after dislocating his shoulder (Photo: REUTERS) \nGooners have long believed that injuries to key players in certain seasons have cost them the title and this does little to allay their frustration - particularly when you consider that Chelsea have had the smallest amount of injury days with just 4,559. That's right Theo - Arsenal players have spent almost two years more injured than anyone else (Photo: Getty Images) \nTake a look at the numbers in full: Total days of injured players since 2011/12 \nIt also may not come as a surprise to hear that in terms of individual player absences, Arsenal take the top two spots in this as well, with Jack Wilshere missing 884 days and Abou Diaby spending 858 days in the physio room.

We just wonder what Arsene's thoughts on these new stats are?
