Congratulations, @kurt13warner ! One step closer to Canton. @ProFootballHOF Class of 2017 Finalist pic.twitter.com/MT7XQWDujP \n— Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) January 4, 2017 \nShould he make the final cut during Super Bowl weekend, he would join Orlando Pace (2016) and Marshall Faulk (2011) as the key contributors for the famed Greatest Show on Turf offense for the then-St. Louis Rams. \nIn his third year of eligibility for the Hall of Fame, this is Warner’s third time listed as a finalist. Warner holds the distinction of being one of only two quarterbacks to go to Super Bowl with two teams. Related: Rams' Kurt Warner expected in the 2017 Pro Football Hall of Fame class \nHe gave the Rams their only Super Bowl win in the 1999 season, winning the league MVP in the process in his first full season. Then in 2008, he led the Arizona Cardinals to their only Super Bowl appearance. \nWarner’s case for the Hall of Fame is largely hampered by his two injured seasons in 2002 and 2003, giving him just three substantial seasons with the Rams from 1999-2001. \nBut within that span, he led the league in completion percentage each year and totaled 98 of his 208 career passing touchdowns. In 2001, his league-leading 4,830 yards were 14.5 percent higher than the runner-up, the sixth-highest margin since 1970. Related: Mike Martz compares Jared Goff to Kurt Warner due to 'elite' moments \nThat unprecedented success was helped of course by Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce. \nThe two combined for 10 Pro Bowl appearances from 1999 to 2007 with Holt being the fan favorite earning seven nominations Bruce had one appearance in 1996 before Holt was in the league. \nIn a three-way tie, the next highest duos have only combined for eight appearances. \nThe path for Warner seems a bit clearer without any quarterback to be used as a measure of comparison that steals votes. Now in his third year as a finalist, this is likely the year a Warner bust is carved out. Related: \nAt the time of Bruce’s retirement in 2009, his 91 touchdowns in 16 seasons were the eighth most all-time. His 15,208 yards were second all-time and only trailed Jerry Rice’s 22,895 yards. Former Rams WR Isaac Bruce and QB Kurt Warner named @ProFootballHOF finalists for the Class of 2017. \n— Myles Simmons (@MylesASimmons) January 4, 2017 \nIn eleven seasons, Holt finished his career the same year as Bruce with 74 touchdowns and 13,382 yards ranking 20th and 10th respectively. But Holt’s claim to fame in a shorter span was eight consecutive thousand-yard seasons from 2000 to 2008. Related: Here is one theory why Torry Holt, Isaac Bruce are not in Hall of Fame \nHe led the league with over 1,600 yards twice and in 2000, combined with Bruce for over 3,000 yards. That would have ranked 14th in the league if it was a quarterback’s numbers. \nBut this is only one more step to make it to Canton. Bruce still has to fight with Terrell Owens and his second-ranked yards and third-ranked touchdowns. \nIf off-field conflicts have any say like they did last season, Bruces still holds a chance to get in before Owens.
