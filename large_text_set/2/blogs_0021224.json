What if that bullet would have been, you know, I don’t know, a couple of inches closer,” Alma Jimenez, Christian’s mother, told CBS 8. “I didn’t see him being aggressive. I saw him being as calm as he possibly could. I saw him trying to reason with the adult.” \nShe told KTLA, “I still fear for our lives, for him living right down the street from us. Him being an officer.” \nChristian told Telemundo, “ I thought I was going to die. I thought he was going to shoot me because he was mad.” Riot cops protecting alleged LAPD officer in #Anaheim pic.twitter.com/XRfESPuwER \n— Gabriel San Román (@gsanroman2) February 23, 2017 \nDuring protests Wednesday night, people chanted, “Killer cops, off our streets!” and “Don’t shoot our kids!” \nHere’s what you need to know: 1. Christian Says the Cop Called a Girl a C*nt for Walking on His Lawn & He Came to the Girl’s Defense \nTwo cell phone videos of the incident were posted online Wednesday, bringing attention to the incident. You can watch the videos above and below. A single shot is fired about the 2:30 mark of the video above. \n“The Anaheim Police Department is aware of the numerous videos posted on YouTube regarding yesterday’s Officer Involved Shooting involving an off-duty LAPD officer,” police said in a Facebook post. “The Anaheim Police Department Homicide Detail is investigating the incident and the case will be presented to the Orange County District Attorney’s Office when complete. Calling and sending emails to APD voicing your displeasure will NOT impact the outcome. A decision whether or not to file charges rests with the District Attorney’s office and is based on facts and evidence.” \nAccording to police, “The confrontation began over ongoing issues with juveniles walking across the officer’s property.” The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon, police said in a statement: \nAPD officers were called to the area of Euclid St and Palais around 2:40 pm Tuesday afternoon regarding a physical altercation between a male adult and several male juveniles. While officers were responding, additional information was received the adult was an off-duty LAPD officer, he had discharged his firearm, and was detaining at least one of the juveniles. Upon arrival, officers contacted the off-duty officer who admitted to discharging his firearm during an altercation with at least two individuals. Nobody was struck by the gunfire. \nChristian Dorscht’s father, Johnny Dorscht, told the Orange County Weekly his son was coming to the defense of a girl who had been verbally attacked by the off-duty cop. He told the OC Weekly his son said the officer called the girl a “c*nt” for stepping on his grass. \nSeveral students can be seen in the videos. The neighborhood is located near Loara High School. \nThe nearly 9-minute Youtube video shows the off-duty officer grabbing onto Christian and pulling hm along the sidewalk as Christian struggles with him. Someone can be heard saying, “you’re the one who started it.” \nAnother man at the scene can be heard saying, “hey, Kevin,” in an apparent attempt to get the officer to let go of Christian. \nThe officer then grabs Christian by the shirt and pulls him onto the law, as Christian says, “let me go, for the last time.” Several students wearing backpacks can be seen on the lawn following the incident. \n“He tried to hit me in my nuts. That’s like a little pussy move, punch a kid in the nuts,” Christian says. He then tells the officer his hand is red and his neck is scratched while asking him to let him go. \nThe officer tells Christian, “your hand is all red because you’ve been resisting me this whole time.” \nChristian then says, “no I wasn’t. You attacked me first and I didn’t do nothing to hurt you. All I said was ‘respect the girl,’ because you said ‘get off my property you c*nt.'” (Youtube screenshot) \nAs Christian continues to ask the officer to let him go, Christian pulls him toward bushes. Another teen comes over and tries to pull Christian away from the officer and a third charges at him and pushes Christian and the officer into the bushes. \nSeveral teens then move toward Christian and the officer as they struggle in the bushes, and the officer lifts up his shirt and pulls a handgun from his waistband. Many of the teens scatter and after a few seconds a shot can be heard, sending the rest of the teens running. \nAs the officer continues to hold Christian, the teen says, “you shot me. You put a gun in my face. What the…” \nAfter a few minutes a police cruiser arrives at the scene and puts Christian into handcuffs while the officer stands with his arms up. \nAnaheim Police Sergeant Daron Wyatt told the Los Angeles Times the videos show only a “very small portion” of the incident. \nWyatt said the video began “several houses down from where the intial contact was made,” CBS 8 reports. A video of the conflict has generated a great deal of interest in the community. Wyatt said it “picks up several houses down from where the initial contact was made.” \n“Yesterday, he sees the kids walking on the lawn and he says, `Hey, guys, please walk on the sidewalk,’ ” Wyatt said. He said the teens responded with a “chorus of epithets.” The unnamed off-duty LAPD officer. (Facebook) \nJay Gonzalez, who posted the Facebook video of the incident and says he doesn’t know Christian, wrote, “This is my video on what happened during the whole situation yesterday and the man was in the wrong for even pulling out his gun, like honestly I understand why he would think of showing it to get the kids off n away from him but taking it out and firing it was hella wrong he had no aim Im guessing it was accidental but He could’ve hurt one of us there. … this ain’t right!” \nJose Tenorio, who shared the video on Facebook, posted a photo of the officer’s house: \nA thug with a badge lives here… He called a young girl some nasty names and so her friends decided to step in to defend her and demand respect for her. The man obviously is no better than 13 year olds because he reacted violently! He hit a minor in his genitalia and used force to detain the child from escaping from his hands. He dragged the child from one end of the yard to the other and then decided to hop over a bush and try to drag that same child into the bush to get him over and so witnesses reacted by attempting to break up the altercation but the man reacted irrationally by pulling out a gun from his waistband and firing it, causing all the children in the area to flee for their lives but no one was shot. This man was an ‘off-duty’ police officer of LAPD! These group of people are trained to handle life threatening situations and yet he reacted like this in front of and because of a group of minors. The two minors were arrested and the off duty officer has not been arrested ‘yet’. \nThe American Civil Liberties Union of California spoke out about the incident on Wednesday, ABC 7 reported. \n“An officer, even off duty, has an obligation to follow the law and protect public safety, rather than threaten it,” Jennifer Rojas, an ACLU official told the news station. “The LAPD officer’s actions on the video are grossly irresponsible.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:51:56.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
