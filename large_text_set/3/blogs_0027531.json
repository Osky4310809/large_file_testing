I have a baby in the back,’ and she said, ‘I’m going to hit your car, and it is going to be your fault,'” Elidrissi said. \nElidrissi said the man and woman hurled obscenities and threats her way before eventually leaving. \n“They said ‘Why are you driving here? They should deport you to your country,'” Elidrissi described. \nElidrissi said the woman threatened to “rip off her face.” \nElidrissi called Minneapolis police, who are investigating the case under the offense of terroristic threats. \nPolice are reviewing surveillance at nearby businesses, but Elidrissi and her husband, Younes, do not want to see the man and woman get in trouble. \nThe couple said they want the people involved to see the Elidrissi family beyond any kinds of labels. \nThey hope the hateful incident can lead to more conversation and unity among people of different backgrounds. \n“This needs to stop,” Monera Elidrissi said. “People need to be aware of it, and if people see people in a situation like that they need to step up and say something.” \nThe Elidrissis said they worry about their American-born son’s future. \n“It is getting worse,” Monera said in reference to hate speech and targeting of minority groups. \n“We will teach our son love and understanding,” Yousef Elidrissi said. “If people don’t like you, you don’t have to be like them; love them and hopefully they will come back to you.” \nThe Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) reports that this is the second such incident in the span of one week in Minnesota.
