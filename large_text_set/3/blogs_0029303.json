Ebenhack/Associated Press Tyler Conway Featured Columnist March 24, 2017 The Minnesota Vikings and defensive end Brian Robison agreed to a one-year contract extension Friday, which will keep him with the team through 2018. Field Yates of ESPN and Matt Vensel of the Star Tribune reported the news. Robison, 33, has played his entire 10-year career in Minnesota. He recorded 28 tackles and 7.5 sacks in 2016, starting all 16 games. A bastion of consistency, Robison has played at least 15 games each year and has only missed two games total. His status with the team may change in 2017, with Danielle Hunter emerging as a force last season. Hunter set a career high with 12.5 sacks, and Robison acknowledged he may not see as much playing time in 2017. \"Here's the thing,\" Robison said of potentially backing up Hunter, per Chris Tomasson of the Pioneer Press . \"At the end of the day, I'm worried about wins and losses, so I want to do whatever is going to help the team win. And obviously that's up to the coaches. \"This is no way in me giving up a position, but I think when you look at what Danielle has done this year, he' s earned the right or at least earned a shot at the starting position.\" Robison has been a regular starter each of the last six seasons. He was a spot player for his first four years in Minnesota. Pro Football Focus ranked Robison 89th among edge defenders last season. Hunter graded out in a tie for 29th.
