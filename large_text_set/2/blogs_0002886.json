And how is it that mediators —who themselves lack any power to impose a solution—nevertheless often lead bitter disputants to agreement? \nOf course, serious mediation training and substantive expertise are critical, as is keen analytic skill. But according to a survey by Northwestern University law professor Stephen Goldberg, veteran mediators believe that establishing rapport is more important to effective mediation than employing specific mediation techniques and tactics. \nTo gain parties’ trust and confidence, rapport must be genuine: “You can’t fake it,” one respondent said. Before people are willing to settle, they must feel that their interests are truly understood. Only then can a mediator reframe problems and float creative solutions. \nGoldberg’s respondents could report only their own perceptions about why they succeed, of course. A detached observer or the parties themselves might have very different explanations.

One is the importance of relationship building , especially in contentious situations. Some measure of trust is required before people will open up and reveal their true interests. The other is that a hallmark of an artful process is that others do not feel maneuvered or manipulated. \nHow Your Organization Can Benefit from Mediation Techniques Download this FREE special report, Mediation Secrets for Better Business Negotiations: Top Techniques from Mediation Training Experts , to discover mediation techniques for selecting the right mediator, understand the mediation process and learn how to engage the mediator to ensure a good outcome from the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. \nAdapted from “Rapport Comes First,” first published in the Negotiation Briefings newsletter. \nOriginally published in 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:58:40.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
