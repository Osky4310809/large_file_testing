Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nFunction of Beauty's customized shampoo and conditioner sets go for $36-$46, depending on the size you select. Function of Beauty instagram\nWith hundreds of brands, scents, and formulas to choose from, shopping for shampoo and conditioner can feel like a trip down the rabbit hole. Most of us stick with brands we trust and ultimately make the final decision based on price, scent, and whatever the bottle promises it'll do: hydrate your hair, make it look shinier or feel silkier — you name it, there's a shampoo and conditioner that says it can do it.\nBut just because you have curly hair and bought the shampoo for curly hair doesn't mean it'll live up to all of its promises.\nWhen Zahir Dossa was receiving his PhD at MIT, he started a beauty cooperative and quickly noticed that every woman had different — and oftentimes conflicting — feedback on the products and ingredients used. And lo, the seed was planted to create Function of Beauty, a service that lets women customize their shampoo and conditioner.\n\"Understanding that beauty is not a one-size-fits-all idea, we are on a mission to disrupt the industry and empower those to choose, create, and design products they use on a daily basis,\" Dossa told Business Insider. \"Our brand's mission is to celebrate who you are what makes you uniquely beautiful, beginning with the choices you make with your beauty products.\"\nOnce logged onto the site, new members are prompted to take a short survey about their hair texture, thickness, and scalp moisture. They're also required to select qualities they want from their formula, whether it's fixing split ends, providing thermal protection, or enhancing curl definition.\nCustomers are able to choose from five formula colors and four scents. Function of Beauty Instagram\nDossa and his two co-founders, Hien Nguyen and Joshua Maciejewski, spent years researching, consulting cosmetics chemists, and creating an algorithm that dictates which ingredients should go into which formula.\nFunction of Beauty currently offers 12 billion custom combinations, so there's truly something for everyone.\nAs if that level of customization isn't enough, the company also allows you to choose the color and scent of your formula and also prints your name on each bottle.\nThe company let me try out the whole process and create customized bottles of shampoo and conditioner to test, and though I have yet to finish each bottle, I'm a fan. The unparalleled level of personalization makes me excited to lather up my hair each morning, which is something I've never said before. After each use, I notice my wavy hair is less frizzy and easier to style. I still have some bad hair days (who doesn't?), but just knowing my shampoo and conditioner are working to protect my hair from my blow dryer gives me some added peace of mind.\nFunction of Beauty's customized shampoo and conditioner sets go for $36-$46, depending on the size you select. While that's more than you'd spend at the drugstore, it's comparable to other high-quality brands you'd find at stores like Sephora and Ulta. And if you ask me, using specially formulated products that work with your hair instead of against it is well worth the investment.\nYou can create your Function of Beauty profile here.
