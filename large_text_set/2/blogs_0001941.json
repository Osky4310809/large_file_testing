Daron had been attempting to sign up for a four-week ,$2,500 course — and had even read a textbook written by the school’s founder in preparation. \nOn its website, the school bills itself as a friendly place for international students, even noting that English proficiency isn’t a requirement. “Joinery is a visual medium with language playing a minor role … don’t worry,” it says.\nWhen Daron shot back an email noting the apparent hypocrisy of the ban on Israelis, Rokosh emailed back that “decisions being made halfway around the world” prompted them to suspend their prior welcome of Israeli nationals, some of whom had attended the school in the past.\n“We are still inclusive and cannot support that which is not inclusive,” wrote the school in an email obtained by the Jerusalem Post .\nBut on Tuesday, as Daron’s story began to hit Canadian and Israeli media, the school rescinded its ban on Israelis, saying it was a “mistake.”\n“After significant thought and listening to all interested parties, ISBA has decided to rescind any restriction placed on accepting students from Israel and apologize for any inconvenience,” wrote Rokosh in a statement to the National Post.\nRokosh added that their policy was a “mistake in the interpretation of the UN declaration.”\nThe statement did not specify which United Nations declaration, although there are none on record that would require a Canadian trade school to ban entry to a particular nationality.\nRelated Jason Reiskind: It’s time Canada ended its double standard that considers Israeli settlements ‘illegal’ Israel approves 2,500 West Bank settlement homes only days after Trump sworn in Oren Safdie: So now all of a sudden I’m a Jewish ‘settler’ according to Obama? One of the more recent declarations, UN Security Council resolution 2334, controversially declared that any settlements in land captured by Israel in the Six Day War have “no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.”\nThe Dec. 23 resolution even called upon states to “distinguish … between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.” But there is no mention of bans or blockades on Israel.\nIn either case, the Island School of Building Arts policy likely violated Canadian law. Under the B.C. Human Rights Code , for one, businesses are prohibited from discriminating based on “place of origin.”\nReached by the National Post, Daron says he doesn’t buy the school’s reversal.\n“I honestly think they only apologized because of all the attention they got, so it’s not genuine,” he said by email, adding “I will never go there.”\n• Email: thopper@nationalpost.com | Twitter: TristinHopper \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:57:00.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
