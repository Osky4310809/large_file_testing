At least 25 people sustained injuries (many of a critical nature) in the crash, which took place at around 6:45 local time. \nThe Advocate reports that the injuries don’t appear to be life-threatening in nature. Police currently suspect that the driver was “highly intoxicated” with Mayor Mitch Landrieu stressing that terrorism does not appear to be a cause.\nWitnesses told The Advocate that the truck’s driver seemed “out of it.” Eyewitness Carrie Kinsella tells the outlet that she felt the involved vehicle, a truck, brush past her at one of the parade’s key intersections: “I actually literally felt it. I felt a rush it was so fast.” \nNew Orleans PD spokesperson Ambria Washington reported details on the situation. “Initial reports show so far about a dozen people are in critical condition,” Washington stated . “That number could increase as the investigation is ongoing.”\nEarlier on Saturday, a motorist in Heidelberg, Germany reportedly drove into a group of pedestrians. The incident injured at least three victims (one critically). Police reportedly shot the suspect, who is now hospitalized, after he attempted to leave the scene. The suspect was carrying a knife, although police state that no known motive for the incident is known at this time.\nThe Germany event follows a recent Berlin incident of terrorism, in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market , injuring dozens of shoppers. In July 2016, a truck attack in Nice, France killed at least 70 people on Bastille Day.\n(Via NOLA.com , Fox 8 , The Advocate & CNN )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:51:29.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
