I thought everyone streamed on Twitch or YouTube? A relative upstart in the streaming game was scooped up by Microsoft and suddenly found itself in the limelight.\nSo you might find yourself wondering how to get started with it and share your Xbox One games (other consoles are available!) with the world. Twitch is built into the Xbox One for simple streaming but with Beam, at least for now, you'll need some additional hardware and software. This will soon be changing, but the best, most customized streams will always come using external resources.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T14:08:30.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
