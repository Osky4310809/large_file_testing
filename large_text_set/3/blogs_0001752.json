INQUIRER FILE PHOTO / RICHARD A. REYES The Department of Education (DepEd) has suspended the administration of the National Career Assessment Exams (NCAE) in Metro Manila and the National Achievement Test (NAT) scheduled for the first two weeks of March. In DepEd memorandum No. 25, Education Secretary Leonor Briones said the administration of the NAT for Grade 10 students originally set on March 2 and for Grade 6 students scheduled on March 9 would be indefinitely postponed due to “administrative and logistical limitations.” The Language Assessment for Primary Grade (LAPG) or the Early Language, Literacy and Numeracy Assessment slated for March 7 has also been postponed. ADVERTISEMENT Briones said a separate memorandum will be issued specifying the new dates of the postponed tests. In the memorandum, Briones also announced the postponement of the 2016-2017 NCAE on March 1 and 2 in the National Capital Region because of “logistical limitations.” All other areas in the country shall push through with the NCAE on the original dates, she said. The new schedule of the NCAE in Metro Manila will be determined by the regional office and schools division offices in coordination with the Bureau of Education Assessment, Briones added. The NAT is taken by all graduating Grade 6 and 10 students in the country, while the NCAE helps junior high school students determine their occupational interest or career track for senior high school.
