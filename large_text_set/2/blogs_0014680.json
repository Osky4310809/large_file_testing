For the next episode, power-directors Kabir Khan, Imtiaz Ali, and Zoya Akhtar will be sharing the couch. And, if the teaser’s to be believed, the conversation between the three and the host, Karan Johar, isn’t exactly IQ-depleting, for once. \nKabir Khan is seen candidly revealing that holding the title “Documentary Filmmaker” isn’t such a good idea in Bollywood. Zoya Akhtar was much too honest when she commented that her brother, Farahan Akhtar, is more popular for his looks (immediately changing her answer to “filmmaking”, for appropriateness). Contributing to this rare candour was Imtiaz Ali who vehemently denied that Karan Johar was “his kind of director”. \nOh and, also, there was an Urdu Quiz thrown in mid-segment to test the directors’ vocabulary, one where Zoya Akhtar surprisingly underperformed, possibly bringing disappointment to her father Javed Akhtar’s eloquent lineage. \nAnd the final blow to Karan Johar’s nepotistic universe was when he asked the directors to name a movie where Shah Rukh Khan’s name is Rahul (mostly KJO’s, of course) as a response to which the trio sported clueless, blank faces. KWK gold, right there! \nWatch the teaser here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:29:25.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
