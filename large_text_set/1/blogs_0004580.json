Unfortunately, 140 characters does not lend itself well to diplomacy with China. On Tuesday, Chinese state media news agency Xinhua, issued an official commentary on Trump’s tweets, saying, “ An obsession with ‘Twitter foreign policy’ is undesirable .” China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 \nThe article also made some pointed jabs at Trump. “ Everyone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isn’t child’s play, and even less is it like doing business deals, ” it read. The commentary came two days after Trump tweeted, “ China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice! ” \nTrump’s use of Twitter has been the subject of scrutiny in the past, but his press secretary told reporters that Trump does not seem to plan on deleting his account any time soon. \" When he tweets, he gets results ,\" Sean Spicer told ABC News. \nIf that wasn’t enough, Trump’s tweeting made it to the Senate floor, where Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) addressed the chamber using Trump’s tweets against Republicans. During the debate around repealing Obamacare, Sanders reminded them of Trump’s campaign promises to not cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
