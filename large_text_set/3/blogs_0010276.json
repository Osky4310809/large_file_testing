That’s why it’s a breath of fresh air to see parents who are divorced that still have the number one priority in mind–their kids. \nJessica Singleton was so grateful for her ex for his selflessness in being a father to their child that she wrote a note explaining her gratitude. In her note she explains that her ex, Jon Megason, goes above and beyond to be there for her and their son. 2 \n“This is my ex. This right here is more valuable than gold. This is a man who doesn’t pay a dime through the state because when my son needs new clothes, I just call him. This is a man who buys a bundle of kids’ movies on Vudu so even I can enjoy them with my son in my own home. A man who drops off the $45 box of pull-ups at my front door so I don’t have to load him up and go to the store. One who takes his son in 10 min notice far often than he should because I have too much to get done or just need a nap. This is a man who listens to me cry because I’m stressed out. This is a man who tells his son not to forget mommy’s boyfriend when he lists his favorite people off the top of his head…” 3 \n“A man who rushes over because we got locked out of the house or spends his evening fixing something for us. This is a man who labeled the presents he bought his son from “mommy” because mommy couldn’t get him as many. A man who still watches my sister’s kids so our son can be with his cousins. One who accompanies me to meet strangers from Craigslist to ensure we are safe. This is the diaper-bag-wearing, chocolate-milk-making, selfless, protective, generous, accomplished FATHER to my son.” 4 \n“The amount of obstacles we’ve had to overcome to get to this point are tremendous. This was not easy, this was a choice. Stop giving excuses and come together for your children. I’m the most stubborn person that I know and forgiveness came easy to us for the sake of our son. And because of that, I see my son every single day. We always welcome each other’s presence. In case I haven’t told you lately, I’m grateful for you. Most importantly for the motivated individual you are and how you provide Pierson with a phenomenal role model despite the foundation you once had. I love the amount of love my son will always have from you.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T15:58:46.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
