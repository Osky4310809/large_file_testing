But the best part may be the meta photos he takes in the destinations that inspire the pullover. \nSam Barsky \nBarsky goes by the name of ColorKnit on Facebook —which is a treasure trove of photos featuring his work. Last year along, Barsky knitted 12 sweaters. \nBut the goal isn't the sell his handiwork. The knitter shared on a Facebook post that it takes him a month to make each one. He even has a sweater with 16 of his previous sweater designs knitted onto it . \nSam Barsky \nHis work has caught the eyes of people around the world, including the Belize Tourism Board. The group has offered Barsky an all-expenses-paid trip to the country in exchange for a Belize-themed sweater (they suggest the popular diving destination Great Blue Hole and the Mayan Lamanai site). Hi @colorknit1 , we love your sweaters! Idea: you knit a sweater of The Great Blue Hole/Lamanai, and we'll bring you on a free vacay.
