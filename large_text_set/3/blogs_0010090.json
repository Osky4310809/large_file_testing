SHARE One of the Blanck Canvas puppets in Victorian Opera's Sleeping Beauty. Photo: Charlie Kinross \nThe joy can be subdivided between the work itself, composed for an Italian puppet company and highly successful in its time, and Victorian Opera's inspired production in which every element – humans, puppets, design, orchestra, lighting, costumes – meld into a night of pure magic. \nRespighi's adroit scoring is far removed from his more opulent orchestral works, such as The Fountains of Rome . Its clarity of orchestration, justifiably beauteous and wildly comedic, always has something new and challenging to say. Yes, it's derivative, and sometime deliberately so (Richard Strauss, Debussy, Wagner are all quoted), but this only adds to the overall sense of fun. That it all ends with a cracker of a love duet and then a smoky dance number, only adds to the madness and charm. \nDirector Nancy Black brings the piece alive, and Joe Blanck's magnificent range of puppets (not forgetting the seven dextrous puppeteers), and an equally fine large cast of 14 singers, make one wonder why this piece isn't performed more often. Conductor Phoebe Briggs and a 20-piece Orchestra Victoria bring intensity, lyricism and affection to the music, which sounds as well as the production looks on the Playhouse stage. \nPraise be to all the performers, but especially to Zoe Drummond's Nightingale, Elizabeth Barrow's Blue Fairy, Raphael Wong's King and Sally Wilson's Queen, Liane Keegan's Old Lady and Duchess; Jacqueline Porter's Princess, and Carlos E. Barcenas's Prince. If there's one sour note, let it be the unfortunate Trumpian reference in Timothy Reynolds' otherwise fine performance as Mister Dollar Cheque. There are cats aplenty in this opera, but \"pussy-grabbing\" is going a little too far. \nOtherwise, I loved it all, down to the last frog, feline and fairy. See it, and share the joy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T04:50:01.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
