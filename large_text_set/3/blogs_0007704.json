You know what’s really cool? A billion babies. \nBut two works, too. And when 1.86 billion active users isn’t enough, sometimes, you just have to grow your audience the old fashioned way. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg today announced that he and his wife Priscilla Chan are expecting a second child. Like their tiny bundle of joy Max, it’s a girl. \n“After our difficult experience having Max, we weren’t sure what to expect or whether we’d be able to have another child,” wrote the expectant father. “When Priscilla and I first found out she was pregnant again, our first hope was that the child would be healthy. My next hope was that it would be a girl.” \nThings apparently have a way of working out for the world’s sixth richest man. And anyway, it’s easier to be a dad when you have an artificially intelligent butler around to lend a helping hand. \n“We are all better people because of the the strong women in our lives — sisters, mothers and friends,” he added. “We can’t wait to welcome our new little one and do our best to raise another strong woman.” \nZuckerberg didn’t give a due date, but if he announced at the typical 12-week mark we can expect the next heir to the Zuckerberg fortune to be born sometime in early fall. \nKeep your eyes open around that time for the introduction of a new Facebook emoji. What tiny pixelated character best represents unbounded joy? We may soon find out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T12:13:01.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
