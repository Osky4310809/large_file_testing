Badgley and Kirke were married in a courthouse on Monday in Brooklyn in front of a small group of their friends and family. \nKirke’s sisters, Lola (of “Mozart in the Jungle”) and Jemima Kirke (of “ Girls “), were also there to celebrate. \nLola wrote on Instagram , \nWhen someone gets married in a courthouse, it’s really an open invitation to everyone but the beautiful bride to explore all that fashion has to offer. Here, I try a look simply called ‘Pants,’ as Cassius goes for ‘That Dude from #incubus’ and Jemima experiments with ‘Off to Therapy!’ Congratulations @dominokirke. We love you. \nOnce upon a time, Badgley dated his “Gossip Girl” co-star Blake Lively for three years (who is now married to Ryan Reynolds ). The actor was also linked with Zoë Kravitz. \nBadgley and Kirke have been dating since 2014. \nBadgley is currently the lead singer for the Brooklyn-based band Mother (spelled MOTHXR for some cool, Brooklyn-hipster reason). \nKirke was also a singer, but she became a doula in 2009 and founded her own business Carriage House Doulas. \nMaking music and helping people give birth — nothing could describe “white people in Brooklyn” more to me than those occupations. \nCongratulations to the happy couple! I hope they have many years together in Brooklyn where they brew their own beer, harvest honey on their rooftop and invite their friends over to try different artisanal cheeses. \nYou two are living my life, and I would be jealous, but I’m trying not to be petty in the year of our Lord 2017. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
