Alpha and omega seem to be new guys as well. Drums and keyboard, hard to tell. Well the band definitely sounds different. There are some bits of improvisation on the guitar, I can't remember stuff like that happened before. They also seem less \"confident\", the way they act and stay on stage. The bass player seems to have a lot of fun and is the most expressive of them all. Papa is definitely the same. 7 Alpha and Omega are 100% different. They do not act the same, look the same, or interact in the same way as Martin and Simon. Plus too, Martin is working on MCC and Simon is working on Priest. 5 sombrero_mop 210 · 17 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply I think the bass player might be the same as before. If I understand correctly he played guitar last year for a while and is now back on bass. But both guitarists are new and most likely the keys (at least 4 keyboards and sitting down is new, the last one had a Nord and a Moog and stood up while playing). 2 The keyboard player also made quite a few mistakes throughout the show with sound patches, playing wrong parts, and a few other little fuck ups that the other ghoul has never done seem to confirm that he's a new guy. 0 Looks like there's still the Moog and Nord up front. 0 I agree about the confidence thing, but if you watch the early ghost shows it was the same, and this was the new guys first gig with probably the biggest band theyve ever been in. Give it time 1 I'll give it time, no problem. Just stating they're obviously new members and like you said, probably their biggest gig ever. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:43:24.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
