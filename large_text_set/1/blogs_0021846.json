Yup, even using someone else's SkyGo login at home means you need one as licences are tied to addresses. \nIf you're in a shared house, you might well be able to get away with one licence for the house - rather than one each – but in almost every other case you'll need a licence unless you never watch broadcast TV. \nBut there's some good news - while you need a licence, you might not need to pay full price for one.

Well, older Britons don't need a TV licence. \nThat means when you reach the age of 75, you can apply for a free over 75 TV Licence . They last 3 years and will be sent out provided you give them your national insurance number. In fact, if you're 74, you can even apply for a short-term licence to cover up up until your 75th birthday. \nSecondly, while it's not free, but anyone who's blind (severely sight impaired) can get half price TV licences . Again, this means the rest of the house is covered too. \nIf you're renting, you don't need a separate TV licence for your room if you have a relationship with the homeowner (and live in their main house) or a joint tenancy agreement - but do need one if you have a separate tenancy agreement for just your room. \nThere are also other times you might be able to get money back on the £145.50 - for example if you're a student you can get a £37 refund .

Here's 5 alternative ways to watch TV without paying the BBC Licence Fee What your licence covers \nIf you live somewhere with a TV licence, you don't need another if you're watching TV on a device that runs on batteries elsewhere (ie a tablet, phone or handheld TV) as long as it's not plugged into the mains. \nIf you're on (or own) a boat or touring caravan you also don't need a new TV licence to watch telly in that either. \nYou're also covered for static caravans, mobile homes and movable chalets - provided no one is at home watching TV while you're using them. If someone is at the main address, you need to fill out a declaration form . \nHowever, if you have a second or holiday house, flat, bungalow or cottage then that needs its own TV licence if you're going to watch live (or recorded live) TV there - no matter what device it's on.
