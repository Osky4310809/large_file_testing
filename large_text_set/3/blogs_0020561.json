Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., echoed that call: The FBI Director testified @realDonaldTrump 's campaign is under investigation for collusion w/ Russia. Lifetime court appointments can wait. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 21, 2017 \nThe outspoken president's most controversial actions and statements loomed heavy over Tuesday's proceedings. Though Gorsuch largely demurred when asked his opinions on hot-button issues like abortion and the Trump administration's travel restrictions from six Muslim-majority countries. \n\"It would be grossly improper of a judge to do that and a violation of the separation of powers and judicial independence if someone sitting at this table, in order to get confirmed, had to make promises or commitments about how they'd rule in a case that's currently pending and likely to make its way to the Supreme Court,\" Gorsuch said of the travel ban that was blocked by a federal judge.
