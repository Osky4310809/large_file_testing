The limited-overs opener is currently undergoing rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru after undergoing a thigh surgery in November. Rohit injured his thigh in the fifth and final One-Day International against New Zealand and was subsequently ruled out of the series against England. He will also miss the one-off Test against Bangladesh in Hyderabad. \"I am really trying my best to get back on the cricket pitch as soon as possible. I can't give an exact date but I will try to play the series against Australia,\" he told India Today on Saturday (February 4). \"I have been in a very positive frame of mind during this phase (injury period) though. Injuries are part and parcel of a game, you can't avoid them for long. \"Also, this wasn't the first time that I was facing such challenging times. The key was to stay positive which I did. This really helped me a lot. I am really working hard on my fitness at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore and all the physios and trainers are helping me get back on the field quickly.\" Australia start their four-Test series in Pune before heading to Bengaluru, Dharamsala and Ranchi for the remaining Tests. The India squad for that series will be announced after the Test against Bangladesh. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:05:12.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
