The London International Mime Festival , celebrating its 40th year, has become famous for programming events that go way beyond the traditionally silent art form of mime. \nThere is not much dialogue here though. The 21 elegantly attired jugglers, joined by musicians and guest mezzo-soprano Emma Carrington, let their tossing and catching of apples do most of the talking. Through solo pieces and breathtaking complex interaction they wittily explore male/female power structures. But don’t worry too much about subtext, just be dazzled by their dizzying skill. \nThe UK-based company's style is as close to dance as it is to circus as they glide around the stage to music ranging from Tammy Wynette to jazz. Apples fly high into the air and seem to defy gravity. Poetry in motion personified, this is avant garde choreographer Pina Bausch meets Hollywood's Busby Berkeley in your local greengrocer's shop wearing a smart suit. \nIf the performance is mainly about control it is also about fun. At the end anarchy ensues as a tea party becomes chaotic and the previously restrained ensemble suddenly makes a mockery of their crockery. Finally the title of Smashed makes sense. This fruity number is in London for one more night – hurry along and have a smashing time too.
