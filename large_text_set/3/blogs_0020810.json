If building an iconic brand to sell people stuff in the shadow of America’s iconic city for making stuff didn’t come easy, it at least made sense. \nFrom there Kmart burrowed its way into our wallets — $37 billion deep by 2000 . From our wallets, Kmart conquered popular culture with cameo roles in film and TV over four decades. Every American knew the phrase “ attention Kmart shoppers ” long before Michael Keaton’s spookily lit disembodied head said it in a scene with Winona Ryder in 1988’s Beetlejuice . \nBut as Donald Trump constantly reminds us, the central role of stuff-making in American life is disappearing, if not gone. And Kmart along with it. Even as the brand disappears from American streetscapes, down from more than 2,000 stores 16 years ago to about 900 with the latest round of closings this week , the brand remains in our hearts. \nAnd they ache. The last time I walked into the Kmart near my house in Northern Virginia, it felt like walking into a crime scene. Between eerily empty aisles and a spooky quiet, neither the clientele nor the staff looked like what I remembered. I kept expecting to find a chalk outline of a dead body on the floor next to the picked over diaper display. \nI didn’t just feel like someone died; I felt like the deceased had been my friend. I didn’t want to feel that way again and I didn’t go back. Judging by the cratering sales at Kmart, I am not alone. Election 2016 is over. Trump won: David Mastio \nIn my nomadic youth, I lived in Ohio, Michigan, Missouri and Nebraska and have vivid memories of the joy that could be found only in the Kmart toy aisle, especially around Christmas. I can’t for the life of me remember which childhood greed-filled scene in my head is in which store in which place. Maybe because it doesn’t matter. Kmart was common ground wherever you lived, and regardless of your status in the middle or working class or among the poor. We all needed our Star Wars figurines. Somewhere, I still have the Boba Fett I almost certainly bought in a Kmart. \nTVTropes.org derisively refers to popular culture’s “ Kmart Realism ” and blames it on Stephen King. If you are a Generation Xer like me, you probably bought your much awaited King novels in a Kmart. Maybe the literary practice of using retail settings to place a story in a certain time, but allow them to be thought of as anywhere, makes more sense to us. We’ll always be Kmart kids even if we shop for our own kids at Target. \nToday, Detroit and Kmart still share a closer kinship than either would like. Besides the specter of bankruptcy, it is hard to imagine a future for either that is anything like the past, and when each tries to go all futuristic, the result is a disaster. Kmart’s failed 2010 effort at becoming a movie-streaming powerhouse is the retailer’s version of Detroit’s failed monorail — cool, but abandoned by people because it only goes in circles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:31:11.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
