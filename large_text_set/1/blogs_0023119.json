There, Belita Nelson described what many of us suspected – the DEA is corrupt to the bone and full of lies. \n“ Marijuana is safe, we know it is safe. It’s our cash cow and we will never give up ,” Nelson said to the audience of doctors and nurses, describing the actual modus operandi of the DEA. \nIllegally Healed reports : \n“Nelson represented the DEA in the international media from 1998 to 2004. She did regular appearances on the talk show circuit, including the Oprah Winfrey show and Nightline, espousing the dangers of cannabis. Today she advocates for its medical use, specifically in the treatment of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in professional football players through an organization she founded: The Gridiron Cannabis Foundation.” \nIt didn’t take long for Nelson to realize that cannabis has medical benefits. In 2000, she was watching her close friend suffer from late-stage cancer, losing more than 50% of his weight and no longer being able to eat or sleep. \nBeing aware of cannabis’ ability to treat these symptoms, Nelson procured some for her friend, who, along with a better diet, was able to live nine more years. Nelson even grew the cannabis herself, knowing that black market products were potentially unsafe. \nIn 2004, Nelson was investigating a heroin epidemic in Plano, Texas and discovered that some addicts were kicking their opioid addictions by turning to cannabis. At this point she could no longer continue pushing propaganda for the DEA when it was clear to her cannabis was a life-saving plant.

They called me in and said ‘name your price, $10,000 a month? $20,000? What do you want Belita?’” \nShe said she left the office screaming, “You know this is safe and you are keeping it from people who are sick! I am not taking your money and you better worry about what I am going to say!” \nSure enough, Nelson turned her passion into something positive. She moved to Colorado and began advocating for medical cannabis. In 2014, she focused her energy on using cannabis to help treat CTE, setting up a holistic clinic with former Denver Broncos player Rick Upchurch. \nCTE, a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated head trauma, kills many former football players. The Gridiron Cannabis Foundation hopes to convince the NFL to allow players to use medical cannabis to counter the onset of CTE. \nRegarding her time at the DEA, Nelson has a succinct way to describe the agency. “If you think the DEA are the good guys, they are not. They are really not. We are talking corruption on steroids.” \nThe DEA refused to reschedule cannabis from a Schedule 1 drug last year when it had the opportunity, somehow concluding that ‘more research is needed’ to show cannabis has medical benefits. The only explanation for maintaining the absurd classification for this miraculous healing plant is to protect Big Pharma, which knows cannabis is a threat to their profits.

This willful deception is in violation a federal law called the Information Quality Act. \nThe DEA is the biggest obstacle standing in the way of freedom and health. It is abundantly clear that corruption and lies – not the interest of the American people – is what drives this agency to continue its tyranny.

There was a quite successful bipartisan campaign to cut their funding by both Congress and the Senate. This was working very well, until Obama came along and increased the D,E,A,’s budget from two billion annually up to twenty eight billion annually. Until this massive overfunding is halted it will take an,unprecedented, natural disaster or world war to remove them from power. Soon everyone who oppose them will be labeled an enemy of the state stripped of all Civil and Human Liberties. Civilization itself is at stake. Already it is beginning to collapse down on top of them, Ultimately all Authoritarian and totalitarian regimes,’ mistakenly’ resort to using fear to maintain power and intimidate their subjects. We all may be forced to go underground. However; it is everyone’s duty to resist. Together our unity as a united front will defeat them. One resembling analogy likens them to a ten pound tick on a five pound dog. They can not be overcome with force however; If they continue to refuse reform, they can, and must be removed.
