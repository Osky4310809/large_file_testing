ADVERTISEMENT \n“It was coach’s call. Maybe it’s because I’m still new and he trusts his old players more in the game. For me, it’s OK. It’s his call and I have no problems with that.” \nThere’s no denying what Yap can bring to the table, and he believes he could have contributed for the squad had he been on the floor during the clutch. \n“It would have been good to play, but of course, I respect coach’s decision. It’s unfortunate because we we already winning.” \nGarcia explained that Yap’s minutes suffered with other guards like Chris Tiu, Jericho Cruz, and Maverick Ahanmisi playing superb, earning them minutes in those crucial stages. \n“I was looking to run and wanted to try to get San Miguel tired, and since we were playing well – Gabe (Norwood) was playing the three and four position just to change the tempo of the game – it was working. So I just stuck to the people who were really working hard on both sides,” he said. \nGarcia cleared that it was no dig at Yap, saying he wants the veteran guard “more involved in the next game.” \nYap understands his situation, knowing he still has to blend in with his new crew. \n“It’s equal opportunity here, so for me, I didn’t expect to get 35 minutes a game here. I have to be ready and I have to accept whatever the decision is because the team is winning. I don’t want to ruin their system if I demand playing time. I have to be the one to adapt to the system.” \nLike Garcia, Yap is looking at this defeat as a way for the Elasto Painters to show their resiliency as they look to rebound next Friday against Meralco. \n“This is where the character of the team will be tested, on how we’ll bounce back.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:26:11.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
