I am excited to announce that I am back in @si_swimsuit .. I figured with my gorgeous daughters @alexarayjoel and @sailorbrinkleycook by my side whose going to be looking at me! \n… and thank you Sports Illustrated for sending the powerful message that good things come in packages of every size and we do not come with an expiration date! \nChristie, you definitely do not have an “expiration date.” Christie Brinkley, 63, is back in her swimsuit for @SI_Swimsuit —with her daughters! https://t.co/p6bkQRNLqz pic.twitter.com/eQEFs8WT4y \n— People Magazine (@people) February 7, 2017 \nThe fun didn’t end with just the above photo, though, because Christie Brinkley and her two daughters attended the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2017 launch event in New York City Thursday night and absolutely crushed it.

Just take a closer look at the 63-year-old Christie Brinkley. \nI keep writing her age because I’m having a hard time believing it’s accurate. REX/Shutterstock REX/Shutterstock \nSpeaking on her appearance in the 2017 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue, Christie Brinkley said, \nMy first thought was, ‘At my age? No way!’ When I turned 30, I was like, ‘This is the last time I’m posing in a bathing suit!’ When this issue comes out, I’ll be 63. I thought, ‘Those days are over.’ But to get to do it with my girls, I thought, ‘One last go!’ \nSpeaking on their Sports Illustrated swimsuit shoot, Brinkley’s daughter Sailor said, \nI want to be 60 years old posing in a bikini, and I want to be that empowering to all women, and I think all of us represent a different thing for women. \nIt’s age-ism, it’s body image issues, it’s just being confident in yourself. I think that’s really important, and I think that representation in those areas is really important, and I’m glad we can do that.

She’s not, like, the standard runway models — she has curves, she has actual hips, you know — and it’s a beautiful thing, and she always rocks it, and that’s a part of why she looks so healthy. \nKeep crushing it, Christie Brinkley! \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
