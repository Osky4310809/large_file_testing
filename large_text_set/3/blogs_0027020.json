Here's how businesses can use it to streamline operations and create new opportunities. | Topic: Innovation \nWhy it's disruptive : Blockchain promises to make firms' back-end operations more efficient and cheaper. Eventually, it could replace companies altogether. \nBlockchains are one of the most important technologies to emerge in recent years, with many experts believing they will change our world in the next two decades as much as the internet has over the last two. \nAlthough it is early in its development, firms pursuing blockchain technology include IBM , Microsoft , Walmart , JPMorgan Chase, Nasdaq , Foxconn, Visa, and shipping giant Maersk . Venture capitalists have so far poured $1.5 billion into the space, with storied firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, and Khosla Ventures making bets on startups. \nA blockchain is a golden record of the truth that creates trust among multiple parties. \nThe applications for blockchain technology seem endless. While the first obvious ones are financial -- international payments, remittances, complex financial products -- it can also solve problems and create new opportunities in healthcare, defense, supply chain management, luxury goods, government, and other industries. In more advanced stages, the technology could give rise to what Gartner calls \"the programmable economy,\" powered by entirely new business models that eliminate all kinds of middlemen, machine networks in which devices engage in economic activity, and \"smart assets\" in which some form of property such as shares in a company can be traded according to programmable or artificial intelligence-based rules rather than the control of a centralized entity. Executive summary (TL;DR) \nWhat is blockchain : A blockchain is a single version of the truth made possible by an immutable and secure time-stamped ledger, copies of which are held by multiple parties. \nWhy it matters : It shifts trust in business from an institution or entity to software and could someday spell the demise of many traditional companies. It also promises to make trade-able many assets that are illiquid today, enable our devices and gadgets to become consumers, and bring trust to many areas of business, eliminating fraud and counterfeiting. \nHow it works : Cryptography secures the data and new transactions are linked to previous ones, making it near-impossible to change older records without having to change subsequent ones. And because multiple \"nodes\" (computers) run the network, one would need to gain control of more than half of them in order to make changes. \nWhy it's disruptive : At the least it promises to make firms' back-end operations more efficient and cheaper, but down the line, it could replace companies altogether. \nBusiness opportunities : New services and products will pop up in areas such as creating and trading assets, tracking provenance, managing supply chain, managing identity, and in providing ancillary services to the software itself. \nMain vendors : More than a dozen platform vendors have sprung up, and several dozen consulting and implementation providers assist in adopting blockchain projects. \nCareer options : The main blockchain specialists include developers and business and technical architects. But roles are also needed in risk management, security, cryptography, business process management, product strategy, and analytics. What is blockchain \nA blockchain is a golden record of the truth that creates trust among multiple parties. Specifically, it's a secure, tamper-proof ledger with time-stamped transactions, distributed amongst a number of entities.
