The company claims that its new smartphone chipset offers up to 27% higher performance or 40% lower power power consumption compared to its predecessor, thanks to 10nm FinFET process technology with an improved 3D transistor structure. The chipset also comes embedded with a new modem for faster download and upload speeds as well as a more powerful GPU for improved 4K and VR content playback experience. Samsung has announced that the Exynos 8895 is currently in mass production. \nThe Exynos 8895 features an octa-core 64-bit CPU, a Mali-G71 MP20 GPU , and a 5CA LTE modem. The CPU cores in the chipset are arranged in two clusters: a quad-core custom CPU (high-performance second generation cores designed by Samsung) and a power-efficient quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU. Samsung claims that its new second-generation custom CPU cores offer improved performance and power efficiency. The Exynos 8895 features a heterogeneous system architecture (HSA), thanks to Samsung Coherent Interconnect (SCI), which means that all its CPU cores can be active at the same time and share the workload depending on the situation. The chipset is also optimized for better performance for artificial intelligence and deep learning tasks. \nThe Exynos 9 series 8895 features the Mali-G71 MP20 GPU designed by ARM and a multi-format codec (MFC), so it can offer improved performance in 3D graphics, 4K UHD VR, and gaming with decreased latency. The new GPU supports up to 4K screen resolution, and the advanced MFC offers 4K 120fps video recording as well as playback. The company claims that its new video processing technology delivers a realistic and immersive VR experience at 4K resolution.The Exynos 8895 is compatible with LPDDR4x RAM along with support for eMMC 5.1, UFS 2.1, and SD 3.0 storage solutions. It also brings support for up to 28-megapixel front and rear-facing cameras. Samsung is also offering support for a 28MP+16MP dual-camera setup. \nIn addition to being built on the most advanced 10nm FinFET process technology, the new Exynos 9 Series 8895 incorporates Samsung’s cutting-edge technologies including a 2nd generation custom CPU, gigabit LTE modem, and more. With industry leading technologies like VPU, the Exynos 8895 will drive the innovation of next generation smartphones, VR headsets, and automotive infotainment system. \n- Ben Hur, Vice President of System LSI marketing at Samsung Electronics \nThe new Exynos 8895 chipset from Samsung is claimed to be the first processor of its kind to get an embedded Gigabit LTE model that supports five carrier aggregation (5CA) for a fast and stable download speeds of up to 1Gbps (Cat. 16). The modem also supports up to 150Mbps (Cat. 13) upload speed with two carrier aggregation (2CA). The chipset also integrates GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou positioning and navigation systems. There’s a separate processing unit dedicated to mobile payments that use iris and fingerprint authentication. The embedded Vision Processing Unit (VPU) can recognize and analyze items or movements for improved video tracking, panoramic image processing, and machine vision technology. \nThe Exynos 8895 chipset will most probably debut with the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus . This year, the chipset will compete with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835, Apple’s A10 Fusion, Huawei’s HiSilicon Kirin 960 and MediaTek Helio X30 for performance supremacy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:59:34.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
