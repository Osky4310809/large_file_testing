Schaefer works for the Inquirer. More by Mari A. Schaefer Arrow icon \nWhat started out as a walk on the beach for two New Jersey women turned into a dolphin rescue. \nNancy Rullo, wife of North Wildwood Councilman Joe Rullo, and her friend Elise were walking their dogs about 1:30 p.m. on Monday when they noticed a dolphin struggling in the surf. About that same time, Joe Rullo walked up on sea wall near Hereford Inlet to see if he could catch up with the pair. \n\"I can’t believe this is happening,\" said Joe Rullo, who looked down and saw his wife in 40-degree water trying to help a dolphin back to sea. He immediately called the North Wildwood Beach Patrol and Fire Department . The Marine Mammal Stranding Center had been alerted and was sending a crew down from Brigantine, he said. \n\"I knew at that point, I had to get men with equipment down there because she is not getting out of the water,\" Rullo said of his wife. \nNancy Rullo, with an assist from another beach-goer, was able to get the dolphin free but with the strong currents, the animal beached again. \nThree firefighters arrived and, dressed in special suits, were able to get the animal on a sling and out into deeper waters, Rullo said. \nThe striped dolphin was one of three that became stranded Monday off the Jersey coast, said Robert C. Schoelkopf, Director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center. The dolphin beached itself again and was examined by the center's veterinarian who determined the animal had a good chance to survive at sea. \n\"They are a deep sea species of dolphin and having them close to shore is very unusual,\" he said. \nHe said it is best to call for help and monitor the stranded marine mammals – including seals – until the professionals arrive. \n\"We ask not people not to push them out,\" said Schoelkopf. He recommends keeping the animal upright and wet. It can be covered with a wet towel as long as the blow hole is free, he said. \n\"We can’t treat it if we can’t see it,\" he said. They try to determine what is wrong with the animal before releasing it. If it is sick, pushing it out may hasten it's death, he said. \nIn this case, he said the trio of dolphins were probably teenagers that got separated from a main group and were traveling together before they got stranded. The center took the dolphin about five miles out into the ocean and released it. Dolphins have good hearing and that should help the strays reunite with their pod. \n\"We are hoping they all made it back out,\" he said. Read more by Mari A.
