Over the past few weeks, Conway has also referred to a “Bowling Green massacre” that never occurred , and she was caught up in a public feud with news network CNN, which said it decided not to have her on a Sunday show. \nAsked about Conway’s remarks on Flynn, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump’s decision to ask for Flynn’s resignation unfolded over time. “It was an evolving and eroding process,” Spicer said. “Once [President Trump] has determined he has made the decision on any subject, that’s when he informs the staff. So, going into the day, it was an evolving situation.” ‘Go buy Ivanka’s stuff’ \nConway has said she misspoke about the massacre and disputed CNN’s characterization of why she didn’t appear on its show, saying she was unavailable. In an interview on NBC’s Today show on Tuesday, Conway denied that her comments about Flynn’s future were inconsistent with his standing with Trump, saying “both were true.” \nThe comments that got Conway in hot water with ethics officials came during a Feb. 9 interview on Fox News . \nAppearing from the White House briefing room, Conway urged viewers to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff” before adding that she was going to “give a free commercial here. Go buy it today everybody, you can find it online.” \nConway’s comments came a day after Trump tweeted that he believed his daughter had been treated “unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which had recently dropped her fashion line. The company has said the decision was not political, but was based on declining sales. ‘Misuse of position’ \nIn the letter to the White House, Walter Shaub, the director of the government ethics office, wrote that Conway’s comments appear to be a “clear violation of the prohibition against misuse of position.” \nSpicer, the White House spokesman, said last week that Conway has been “counselled” about her comments, but the government ethics office said it has yet to receive any guidance on what if anything happened as a corrective action. The White House didn’t immediately respond to questions sent via email Tuesday. \nThe letter notes lawyers for the White House and the government ethics office spoke on Feb. 9, the day of Conway’s interview, and that Representative Jason Chaffetz, the Utah Republican chairman of the House oversight and government reform committee, and Representative Elijah Cummings, the committee’s ranking Democratic member from Maryland, asked the ethics watchdog to follow up. Chaffetz has said that Conway’s comments were “wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line.” \nThe government ethics office is requesting that White House lawyers tell them in writing by Feb. 28 what they’ve done about Conway’s comments. The office advises executive branch officials on abiding by ethics laws and rules but doesn’t have investigative or enforcement authority. none", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:10:14.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
