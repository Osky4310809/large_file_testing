Well, Pirro may have wanted to talk about the wiretapping claims and FBI director James Comey ‘s response to them, but Conway seemed to be there to talk about another of Trump’s main complaints : anonymous sources in the media. \nFirst, Conway was coy when asked by Pirro if Trump knows for sure that his phone lines were tapped. She said “he may,” but cautioned viewers to keep in mind that the President gets different intelligence briefings than most people. \n“This is serious stuff,” the Counselor to the President then said of the leaks. \nConway went on to rail against Democrats for, in her opinion, caring more about possible Russian collusion and interaction than about leaks from within the White House. \nPirro asked simply if it was even appropriate for Trump to accuse Obama of wiretapping in the first place. \n“Are we now facing a Constitutional crisis before the first 100 days are over?” the seasoned host wondered. \nConway said that no, there is no crisis, but if Comey has anything to say, she’d be happy to hear it before pivoting back to what she saw as the bigger problem: anonymous sources. \nIn short order, Pirro ended the segment with Conway and moved on to reactions from other sources. \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[image: screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
