It cites Spectrum’s inability to deliver on promises of such standard content as Netflix and gaming. \nThe AG touched upon evidence, including internal emails acknowledging that Spectrum was unable to deliver speeds promised to customers in its press material. According to the suit, \nFrom at least January 1, 2012 to the present, Spectrum-TWC conducted a systematic scheme to defraud and mislead subscribers to its Internet service by promising to deliver Internet service that it knew it could not and would not deliver. \nThe company issued a statement to Reuters that reads less like a denial than an insistence that it’s trying to get better. It responded, “Charter has already made substantial investments in the interest of upgrading the Time Warner Cable systems and delivering the best possible experience to customers.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T20:11:00.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
