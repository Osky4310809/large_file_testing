However, you may want to think twice before snapping a photo. After all, visitors are given only about 45 seconds in each room, and that time is better spent actually contemplating the art, says The Washington Post’s Lavanya Ramanathan . “I am going to argue for the mindful, ‘be here now’ approach to museum going,” she says. In contrast, Huffington Post art critic Priscilla Frank says that selfies are a perfectly acceptable way to respond to the mirror rooms. “It’s this very physical way to enact what I think is the spirit of the room: dissolving boundaries, proliferating yourself and also sharing yourself,” Frank says. Whether you snap a photo or not, the trippy experience of seeing your face multiplied endlessly among a sea of glowing pumpkins, floating candles or twinkling lights will either reinforce or puncture your ego, or perhaps do both at the same time. It all depends on you.\nContest: Win free tickets to the show\nTickets for the exhibit’s first two weeks have been snapped up , but don’t despair.
