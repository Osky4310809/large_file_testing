CVS Health Corp. ( CVS ), Express Scripts Holding Co. ( ESRX ), and UnitedHealth Group Inc’s ( UNH ) OptumRx unit were named in a federal court filing in New Jersey last week. \nThe PBMs are alleged to have been part of a collusion scheme along with Eli Lilly & Co. ( LLY ), Novo Nordisk ( NVO ), and Sanofi AG ( SNY ). The three largest PBMs jointly account for 80% of the prescription drug industry in the U.S. and manage benefits for around 180 million individuals. (For more, see What Is the Pharmacy Benefit Management Industry? ) Second Case Against Insulin Makers \nFour individual plaintiffs were joined by a nonprofit organization called the Type 1 Diabetes Defense Foundation is the suit. \nIn January, the three insulin makers were named as defendants in a separate federal court filing in Massachusetts, alleging that the companies significantly increased list prices of lifesaving insulin, raising them in lockstep and harming patients’ interests. \nThe cases come amid growing outcry over the nation’s opaque drug-pricing system which is seen as benefiting both drug manufacturers as well as intermediaries. \nAlong with the accusations that the drug makers colluded to increase the drug prices in a planned manner, which resulted in price increases of more than 150%, the plaintiffs also allege that the drug makers shared additional revenues with PBMs through rebates.

Responses from Drug Makers and PBMs \nA CVS spokesperson claims that PBMs don’t have any role in determining drug prices, the allegations are built on a false premise and they are without merit. Novo Nordisk too disagrees with the allegations. Spokesmen for Express Scripts and Sanofi denied the allegations and said the companies would defend themselves vigorously, reports Bloomberg BNA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:23:48.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
