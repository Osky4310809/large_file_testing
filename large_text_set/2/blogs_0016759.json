Thematically it hasn't changed very much, but during the treatment phase a rather big change was made, and it involved cutting a character completely out of the story. \n\"I'll say one major thing that happened during the treatment phase, not even during the script phase, during the treatment phase there was another character that was a major character. That was a part of the treatment. Although it kind of worked generally in the story, I got to the place where there were too many characters. I think Civil War handles a lot of characters really well, but they're minor characters, and in this movie, every character has their own arc. Their own thing. And I thought it was one character too many, so I took one of the characters out of the story about half way through the treatment phase. But the eventual 70-page treatment, which is what it was, is what this movie is, and it has changed very, very little. And there's been almost no changes in the past three or four months before shooting; minor, minor lines here and there. We did rehearsals and some things I changed because of that. Now, who knows, we may get into post and go \"oh my God, let's change everything,\" I hope that isn't the case, but I've been really fortunate.\" \nGunn didn't give that character a name and didn't even say if he or she was part of the Guardians or just an important supporting player. Once fans see the film, it might be a bit easer to figure out who would have fit within the constraints of the story. \nGunn hasn't had to change much during the fimling process, and most of that is due to a really sound script. \"And part of it is because I knew on the last movie we did do a lot of changes later on. We did some changes in production. We did some changes in post-production, and I knew this time I was really fortunate to have such a headstart on the script. And to make that story really strong so we could have that from the beginning. And so that was something I focused on, was really dialing in the screenplay, the dialogue, everything before we ever even came here to Atlanta.\" \nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos.
