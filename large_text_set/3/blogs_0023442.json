SEE ALSO: Apple's MacBook Pro gets perfect slam from ancient Lenovo ad \nThat means to connect almost anything to the laptops, (including the iPhone 7) you'll need a ton of dongles, costing upwards of $100. \nLine Dock wants you to never have to buy accessories from Apple in the first place. The portable docking station fits right under your laptop and replaces all of the legacy ports. \nIt also comes with some other perks that help justify its hefty price tag, like a 20,000 mAh battery that can provide an additional 1.5 charges for your laptop as well as up to 1TB of additional storage. \nIt seems like it might be a little awkward to work using Line Dock though because your MacBook will be elevated slightly off the table. \nFor example, my forearms rest directly on my desk while I work, and it's not clear that it would be as comfortable while using Line Dock. I haven't tried it for myself though. \nThe device is available for the 12-inch, 13-inch, and 15-inch MacBooks. It will reportedly also be available soon for other USB-C laptops as well. It includes four wireless charging pads, is 9mm thick and weighs 1.3 pounds. \nImage: Line dock \nThe lowest level option (without the extra storage) will cost $149, but if you sign up to be notified when it launches, you can reportedly snag it for up to 40 percent off retail prices. \nThe highest end option (with the full 1TB of storage) will cost a whopping $599. All models will reportedly begin shipping in June 2017, according to a post by one of the company's backers. \nIt's a little mind boggling that we now need a device like Line Dock to make a $1,499 MacBook Pro fully functional, but that's the world we currently live in. \nAt least it looks sleeker than a bunch of dongles crowding your desk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:33:24.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
