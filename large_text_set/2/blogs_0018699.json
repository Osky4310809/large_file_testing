It is argued that long-term conditions such as dementia and heart disease are better dealt with by keeping patients in their own homes. \nThe plans will see maternity and children’s services in Lancashire “centralised” on to one site. \nWarnings were issued for West Yorkshire and Harrogate that five hyper-acute stroke service may “no longer be viable”. \nIn Nottinghamshire they intend to significantly downsize City Hospital and reduce the number of beds across Nottingham by 200. \nAccording to the analysis by the BBC these changes will come alongside the creation of “super” community hubs of GPs, care workers and district nurses as well as seven-day access to GPs. \nHospital specialists will run clinics in the community to bring care close to people’s homes. Hospital specialists will run clinics in the community \nA report by the King’s Fund warned community services are already “feeling the strain” and could not cope with an increase in workload. \nAnd the health think tank said slashing numbers of hospital beds further reductions could de-stabilise services already “stretched to their limits”. \nA spokeswoman for NHS England said: “They will allow the NHS to take advantage of new technologies, adopt successful practice more widely and make practical improvements in areas that we know matter most to patients. \n“These proposals are all about putting collaboration at the heart of our care system, with health and local government working more closely together than at any time since the NHS was created.” \nThe proposals - known as sustainability and transformation plans - have been drawn up as part of NHS England’s five-year strategy to release £22 billion of efficiency savings by 2020. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (Photo: PA) \nConsultations on major changes will take place later this year with the hope implementation will follow soon after. \nBut the King’s Fund warned the changes could be subject to legal challenges. \nThe government is investing more money in the NHS, but a fund set up to pay for changing services has been swallowed up by deficits, figures released on Monday showed. \nA £1.8 billion pot set aside this year for funding transformation has been used to shore up NHS trust finances as they struggle to balance their books. \nThe Department of Health insists extra money was being invested in the NHS this Parliament and gave the health service enough funds to change the way it worked. \nA spokesman said: “These NHS plans developed by local doctors, hospitals and councils working together with the communities they serve will help patients get better care.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:26:37.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
