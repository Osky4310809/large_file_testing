Because their universe is now well-established, the studio is able expand their scope of characters — with the most recent examples being the introductions of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) in Captain America: Civi War . And while fans are only months away from Spider-Man: Homecoming , they will have until 2018 for Black Panther .\nWhile there are currently many unknowns about Black Panther , there’s no question that it will have a phenomenal cast. Along with Boseman, the cast includes notable stars Forest Whitaker, Danai Gurira , Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett, among others. Marvel may be known for assembling of A-list ensemble casts, but this may be one of the most impressive to date, particularly for a solo character movie. And even with so many big names already on-board Black Panther , yet another name has been added.\nMarvel has confirmed that American Crime Story ‘s Sterling K. Brown will be joining the cast of Black Panther . Brown will take on the role of N’Jobu, a figure from the titular hero’s past. Even though nothing else was revealed about Brown’s casting, this is nevertheless very exciting news that yet another talented star is attached to the film.\nBrown is definitely an interesting choice for Black Panther . He’s not necessarily a household name, but that doesn’t mean he’s without his fair share of impressive credits. Most recently, Brown won an Emmy and is currently nominated for a Golden Globe for his representation of Christopher Darden in The People V. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story . Some of his other notable television work includes Person of Interest , Army Wives , and the recent This is Us . So, Brown is clearly a diverse and accomplished character actor who should easily be able to fit into Black Panther . While it may be some time before we know the exact role of N’Jobu in the film, there should be no question in the talents of the actor playing him on screen.\nAfter this latest addition, Black Panther is looking better by the day. The film’s strong cast matched with the skill of director Ryan Coogler ( Creed ) seems like a sure recipe for success. What mysteries remain, however, is how all of these pieces fit together. Marvel boss Kevin Feige revealed that the film is a “geopolitical action adventure,” so there’s really no telling what lies in store for us with that in mind. Additionally, the film’s working title of Motherland could very well mean there will be a focus in the hero’s home in Africa. Regardless, the film looks to be taking a pretty big departure from what prior Marvel movies have done. And with principal photography for Black Panther beginning this month , expect many more announcements in the near future.\nSource: Marvel", "external_links": ["https://news.marvel.com/movies/57685/sterling-k-brown-signs-marvels-black-panther/", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/american-crime-story-sterline-k-brown.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/american-crime-story-sterline-k-brown.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/american-crime-story-sterline-k-brown.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/american-crime-story-sterline-k-brown.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/american-crime-story-sterline-k-brown.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/american-crime-story-sterline-k-brown.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/american-crime-story-sterline-k-brown.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/american-crime-story-sterline-k-brown.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1400&h=700&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-05T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:26:33.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
