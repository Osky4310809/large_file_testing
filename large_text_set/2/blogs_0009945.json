TSA has zero tolerance for employees engaged in criminal activity to facilitate contraband smuggling,” said José Baquero, federal security director for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, in the Monday press release. \nUp to 10 suitcases carried by five “drug mules” may have flown together on a single plane, the DOJ alleged. \nThe bust was a result of an Airport Investigations and Tactical Team (AirTAT) investigation, a 2-year-old multi-agency initiative. \nOther defendants named in the announcement were Edwin Francisco Castro, Tomas Dominguez-Rohena, Ferdinand López, José Gabriel López-Mercado, Javier Ortiz and Miguel Ángel Pérez-Rodríguez. \nAll 12 could be behind bars for a minimum of 10 years or a maximum term of life if convicted. \nThe TSA and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) are leading the investigation in cooperation with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement-Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the US Marshals and the Police of Puerto Rico, according to the announcement. \nAssistant US Attorney Stuart J.
