Way back in October, when a 23-16 loss to Atlanta was the first blemish on Denver’s record, the football cognoscenti shouted this defeat was evidence Lynch was not ready to play at the NFL level, rather than seeing something more important: Kubiak never gave Lynch a real chance to succeed, because he didn’t have the stomach for the mistakes all rookie quarterbacks inevitably make. \nAgainst the Falcons, Lynch looked lousy in Kubiak’s system. On 11 pass plays under center, Lynch was sacked three times, had only four completions and had a miserable quarterback rating of 71.3. Worse, the Broncos ran the ball twice as much as they passed with Lynch taking snaps under center, a game plan so predictable it was almost criminal. \nBut, in his first NFL start, Lynch also moved the Broncos when he was allowed to play in the shotgun or with a no-huddle attack, a more-aggressive, less-cerebral style that made him a hot pro prospect at Memphis. He completed 19 of 26 passes for 170 yards in either the hurry-up or the gun against Atlanta. Under conditions in which Lynch could thrive, his quarterback rating was a very respectable 90.2, especially when you consider that Siemian’s season-long rating was 84.6. \nLynch did not get another chance to start until December, when he beat Jacksonville with one of those painfully conservative game plans Kubiak used to employ with a broken-down Peyton Manning a year earlier. But it’s also worth noting: Against the Jaguars, Lynch’s quarterback rating under center was a horrendous 47.9, while from the gun it was 84.9. \nYes, we’re talking about small sample sizes with Lynch. But that’s all we have, because Kubiak wasted a year of the rookie’s development by trying to sneak into the playoffs with a stout defense and the low-risk, low-reward play of Siemian. I am of the belief a stress test can be very revealing. In his biggest game of the year, Siemian had the Patriots on his home turf. And he was wretched. New England coach Bill Belichick did not harass Siemian with high-frequency blitzes. He simply had his defense sit back and watch as Siemian threw a pick and compiled a 73.1 rating while putting up a measly three points. \nYou want the Broncos to get back to the Super Bowl? \nThen the first job is to find out if there’s a way Lynch can succeed as Denver’s starting quarterback.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:41:01.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
