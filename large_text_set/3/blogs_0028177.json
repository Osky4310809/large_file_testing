Olaolu Daudu, on Tuesday in Lagos said the programme took place at the Command Day Secondary School, Ikeja. \nThe programme was tagged “Expressing your Unique Advancement in the 21st Century.” \nSpeaking during the programme, Mrs Omotola Oyefolu, President, 81 Division Chapter of NAOWA, said the girl-child was more vulnerable to physical assault and sexual molestation than her male counterpart. \n“NAOWA is partnering and collaborating with Wise Hearth Solution Foundation on the empowerment programme which is targeted at the girl-child. \n“This is because the phenomenon is on the increase, with most cases hardly reported for fear of reprimand, punishment and shame. \n“I implore children not to allow their uncles and aunties to lure them into any form of abuse by enticing them with gifts,” the statement quoted Oyefolu as saying. \nIt also quoted the GOC of the Division, Maj.-Gen. Babatunde Oyefolu, as saying that girl-child sexual molestation and other forms of abuse were serious issues. \n“Reported cases of rape, negligence of parents to children responsibilities appear to be on the increase in the barracks community. \n“The prevention of child-girl abuse is a mobile drive for reasons which include guaranteeing a safer and more secured environment not only for the girl-child but for all,” the GOC said. \nHe commended the 81 Division Chapter of NAOWA for coming up with such a laudable project.
