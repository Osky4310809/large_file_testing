Chumanchil. Philstar.com/Artemio Dumlao, File photo \nVIGAN CITY, Philippines - A marijuana (cannabis) grower slipped from authorities Thursday after his plantation was raided Wednesday in hinterland Nagbukel, Ilocos Sur. \nGeorge Cabalar alias Tomas, was able to flee and evade raiding anti-narcotics agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) and Ilocos Sur policemen, though his 600 fully-grown marijuana plants worth P120,000.00 were torched. \nThe cannabis grower reportedly noticed the raiding authorities approaching his marijuana plantation and managed to flee on foot. \nAside from the marijuana plants, authorities seized another 20 kilos of dried marijuana valued at P500,000 from Cabalarâ€™s plantation. \nAuthorities are suing Cabalar for illegal drugs and will pursue him until he is brought to the jail, the PDEA-Ilocos region said.
