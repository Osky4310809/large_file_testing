With each device requiring 10,000 kg of steel, manufacturing alone would absorb the entire steel production of the United States. Hauling them to the Arctic meanwhile, would require half of the world’s container ship fleet.\nAssuming no major setback, the paper estimates the final cost at about US$5 trillion, roughly the annual GDP of Japan.\nThe environmental footprint wouldn’t be insubstantial, either. Steel production alone would emit roughly 163 million tonnes of carbon dioxide — about one-fifth of Canada’s total annual greenhouse gas emissions.\nNevertheless, given the end goal, the researchers from Arizona State University call the cost “economically achievable” and the environmental impact “negligible.”\nHowever, they also costed a scaled-down, $500-billion plan that would  deploy ice machines to only 10 per cent of the Arctic.\nThe Canadian Press, Jonathan Hayward This July 10, 2008 file photo made with a fisheye lens shows ice floes in Baffin Bay above the Arctic Circle, seen from the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker Louis S. St-Laurent. The whole point of the mega-project would be to preserve “ice albedo,” the phenomenon of sea ice reflecting sunlight away from the Earth.\nMuch like wearing a white T-shirt on a hot day, global warming is slowed down by the presence of huge portions of the globe that remain perpetually white.\nAt current rates of warming, by the 2030s the Arctic Ocean could see its entire ice cap disappear by late summer. With that ice gone, previously reflected sunlight will then be absorbed by the open ocean, speeding the rate of global warming.\nRelated ‘We are approaching the end’: Arctic oil town fears future as Imperial’s 1920-era wells shut Polar bears may only be able to survive in Canada’s Arctic islands and north Greenland as ice melts: report A crack in an Antarctic ice shelf grew 27 km in the last two months and will soon create a massive iceberg “The need is  urgent , as the normal cooling effects of summer sea ice are already lessened and may disappear in less than two decades,” reads the paper.\nThe fleet of ice machines would be designed to add an extra metre of sea ice to the Arctic every winter.\nThe report contains no specific designs on the water pump, but described it as wind turbine and tank assembly mounted atop a buoy.\nPostmedia File Bringing one of the history's largest industrial projects to the Arctic would probably require a permit or two. Researchers did the math to confirm that the Arctic has adequate wind capacity, but the awesome, unforeseen logistical challenges of the project are only briefly mentioned.\nWater tanks on the devices would be prone to freezing, wind turbines would be susceptible to seizure by rime ice and the whole device would be extremely vulnerable to salt water corrosion.\nNot to mention the army of workers and equipment that would be needed to maintain 100 million remote machines in one of the world’s harshest environments — particularly when the machine’s whole function is to surround itself with sea ice.\n“The engineering challenges of translating even such a common technology to the harsh environment of the Arctic are daunting,” reads a somewhat understated summary of the challenge. \n• Email: thopper@nationalpost.com | Twitter: TristinHopper \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:23:46.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
