And I think ‘Donald Trump’ or the ‘campaign’ also probably meant Mike Flynn,” Paul said. “So I think really we’re arguing circles around something that most people are admitting.” \n“Somebody was spying on the Trump campaign and … Mike Flynn lost his job because of an illegal felony in which somebody released the results of spying on the Trump campaign.” \nAs the highest level ever NSA whistleblower William Binney said earlier this month, the government is spying on everyone , including Trump, and the FISA courts are “simply out there for show” to give the false impression “the government is following the law, and being looked at and overseen by the Senate and House intelligence committees and the courts.” \nAs Binney said, the real spying is being “done outside of the courts” and “outside of the Congress.” \nI guarantee everything Trump and everyone connected to him did was being spied on by the deep state just as everything he and his staff are doing now is also being spied on by the deep state and leaked to The New York Times and The Washington Post. \nWashington DC is the swamp and hack politicians like Trey Gowdy are not going to drain it. As Rush Limbaugh said rightly about these hearings earlier today : “the objective is that Trump either stops this reform business he’s got, stops this drain-the-swamp stuff, and starts letting the Washington Republicans run the town again, or they’re gonna impeach him.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:18:18.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
