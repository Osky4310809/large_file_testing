For Women’s History Month, the iconic Brawny man is being replaced by a woman. \nThe new packaging features a woman wearing the classic red and black flannel shirt. You’ll be able to purchase the limited-edition eight-roll packages during the month of March in Walmart stores across the country. \nIt’s all part of the paper towel brand’s #StrengthHasNoGender initiative, which is in its second year. The campaign was started by Georgia-Pacific, Brawny’s parent company, in an effort to champion women in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). \nCan’t they champion women without getting rid of an iconic man? \n— Kemberlee Kaye (@KemberleeKaye)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:16:59.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
