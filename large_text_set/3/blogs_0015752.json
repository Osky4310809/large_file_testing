Pete Sessions held a town hall at Richardson High School. The Republican's 32nd district contains much of Northern Dallas County and a bit of Collin County as well. Constituents were asked to RSVP ahead of time, though we were told that this would not guarantee us a seat due to the overwhelming response. \nBearing this in mind, I walked to RHS about an hour and a half before the event was slated to begin and was met with a long line snaking around the block. Fortunately, I was seated and able to observe what was a lively and raucous display of democracy at work. Detractors outnumbered supporters by at least 10-1, though in fairness, voters generally don't come out to have their voices heard when they agree with everything they think they'll hear. Though many claims have been made about non-constituents and paid protesters attending the event, everyone I spoke to resided in the 32nd district. \nI'll admit, I wasn't expecting much from the town hall based on what I understood of the format. Congressman Sessions would take only pre-screened questions that had been submitted ahead of time and the audience would not be allowed to vocalize any concerns. I imagined a series of softball questions offered up to allow the congressman to stick to his talking points and address only those issues that served him. To his credit, I was immediately proven wrong. One of the first invited speakers was the parent of a disabled child who had worked with Sessions in the past. It became immediately clear that she did not support the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. To the cheers of the crowd, she urged the congressman to oppose the Republican-proposed AHCA. \nOnce Sessions finally took the stage, he began with a convoluted and thinly supported Powerpoint presentation that seemed to connect Obamacare with a lack of growth in the U.S. economy. The boos and jeers began almost immediately, and one almost couldn't blame the congressman for lobbing an insult toward the crowd, mockingly telling folks that he finally understood why they were so frustrated, because they \"didn't know how to listen.\" \nAfter this, he moved on to questions. My preconceived ideas were again proven false as the questions were anything but softballs. Almost all of them echoed the mood within the auditorium and were critical of the Republican platform. Again, credit to the congressman for not shying away from tough questions. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, reacts after the crowd erupted during the question portion of the town hall meeting in the auditorium of Richardson High School in Richardson on Saturday, March 18, 2017. (Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nTough questions are one thing, but answers are apparently another. Though Sessions proved himself capable of answering questions succinctly and directly (he doesn't think Meals on Wheels will be defunded, and he is opposed to the legalization of marijuana, for example), he chose not to do so for the majority of the town hall. When asked if he was concerned about Russia's potential influence in the presidential election, he answered by talking only about allegations Trump has made about wiretapping. When he got a question about school vouchers, he spoke only about choices for disabled children and didn't address the issue as a whole. The crowd chanted \"yes or no\" to try to solicit direct answers. \nRowlett Mayor Todd Gottel acted as moderator but didn't seem to understand the role. When the congressman went off topic or didn't answer the question that was asked, he made no attempt to ensure the original issue was addressed. This doesn't serve either his supporters or the naysayers. \nFor all the credit Congressman Sessions deserves for hosting a town hall in the first place and for allowing opposing viewpoints to be freely expressed, he doesn't get any credit for actually addressing most of these issues. It's easy to hold a town hall and be asked uncomfortable questions. But directly speaking to the concerns of your district and showing true accountability is entirely another. He failed on that count. The congressman only won 70 percent of the vote in 2016, though the Democrats didn't field a candidate to oppose him. His district voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. \nIf this town hall was any indication of how he plans to engage his constituents and represent them as a whole, Pete Sessions might not have to worry about which questions he wants to answer after the 2018 election. \nDylan Whitehead is an insurance professional in Richardson and a Community Voices Columnist.
