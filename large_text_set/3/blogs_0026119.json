Photograph: Nick Potts/PA 5) Chile might be grateful for just a play-off spot \nWhen Alexis Sánchez posted a picture of himself training with Chile this week in only a very small pair of shorts, a couple of things were noticeable: firstly, how sad it is when someone lets themselves go like that, but also the massive strapping on his right ankle. Arséne Wenger said after the West Brom game, in which Sánchez was injured by a set of rogue James McClean studs, that his ankle was “in a terrible state”, but there he was, this never-stopping sack of muscle and energy, looking absolutely delighted with the world. Not that it did Chile much good on Thursday night, of course: the 1-0 defeat to Argentina, in which Sánchez played the full, Arsenal nerve-inducing 90 minutes, pushed the Copa América holders down into sixth place in the South American table. Admittedly just three points separate them and Uruguay in second, but this was another disappointing result in a qualification campaign that has underwhelmed, and at the moment Chile might be grateful for even managing a play-off place. Sunday’s game against Venezuela is now even more crucial. Luis Miguel Echegaray: Peru aim for first World Cup since 1982 6) The dream is flickering for Tahiti \nAnd if Argentina don’t manage to make that top four, they could face a play-off against, as you surely know, Tahiti. The tiny island has, it goes without saying, never qualified for the World Cup before, but their chances of making it increased this week when they came from behind to beat Papua New Guinea 3-1. The two sides will meet again on Tuesday, and another victory there should put them into the final round (although agonisingly that won’t be confirmed until June). If they qualify, they will probably face New Zealand for the chance to play off against the fifth-placed South American side. There are several hurdles to jump, and given that their sole appearance in the Confederations Cup (in 2013) saw three defeats with an aggregate score of 24-1, they probably shouldn’t book flights to Russia just yet... but the dream is flickering. Football Weekly Extra: listen to our table-topping podcast 7) Qualification now Northern Ireland’s realistic aim \nMichael O’Neill’s first game in charge of Northern Ireland was against Norway, back in 2012. The Norwegians won handily, a 3-0 victory coming in the middle of a 22-game run in which O’Neill’s side managed only to beat the Faroe Islands. Things have changed rather since then, ahead of Norway’s return to Belfast on Sunday, and after an encouraging showing at Euro 2016, it’s interesting to note the terms in which most around the Northern Ireland squad are talking. “The players talk among themselves about how confident we are,” said winger Stuart Dallas this week. “We can’t really see ourselves getting beaten or putting in a bad performance.” O’Neill himself spoke about this fixture “setting up” bigger games ahead against Germany and the Czech Republic, and is no longer speaking in terms of progress or incremental improvement: qualification for the World Cup, for the first time in a generation, is their realistic aim.

Now, to Antoine Griezmann, Kingsley Coman, Anthony Martial, Fekir, Lacazette and Ousmane Dembélé, add the wunderkind du jour, Kylian Mbappé, apple of many scouts around Europe’s eyes and the 18-year-old who looks to be the next great talent of French football. “The fact that it is his first time with the national team does not mean he cannot start,” said Deschamps ahead of France’s qualifier against Luxembourg on Saturday. Mbappé’s age suggests he’s a boy, a young stripling with plenty to learn, but anyone who has watched him play will tell you he already looks like a man, in body and temperament. And, the chances are before the weekend is out, a full international too. Russia 2018: how the main contenders are shaping up 9) Australia’s chances are looking perilous \nAnge Postecoglou is a man with grander plans than mere qualification for the World Cup. “I know people feel good about qualification, I understand that — I certainly want to,” he said earlier this week, commenting that he was looking for something bigger. “Just qualifying for a World Cup has proven in the past is not as fulfilling as maybe people think it is when you’re in the middle of it,” he continued. However, that was before Thursday’s 1-1 draw with Iraq, a game in which Australia clung onto a point in terrible conditions, but now Postecoglou might be pining for the unfulfilled days of simple qualification. Australia have just two wins to their name in this campaign, with both Saudi Arabia and Japan in better shape at the halfway stage of the group. There is a very real possibility that Australia will miss out on the tournament for the first time since 2002. Postecoglou is famously stubborn, but he may have to change a few things to improve his team’s chances.

Well, erm, not brilliantly so far. After a heart-lifting 1-1 draw with Finland in their opening game, the new boys were on the wrong end of a 6-0 hosing by Croatia, before 3-0 and 2-0 away defeats to Ukraine and Turkey. This weekend perhaps represents their best chance so far to notch a first competitive win, as they host the team of Roy Hodgson’s nightmares, Iceland. Kosovo coach Albert Bunjaki pointed to Iceland as an inspiration for his own team earlier this month, but is clearly not keen on accepting gradual progress. “The time has come for a victory,” Bunjaki said, “and we enter this match to win.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T12:06:06.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
