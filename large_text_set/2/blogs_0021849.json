King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 3 hours ago 14 \nSteven Adler sang praises of Dave Grohl, saying Foo Fighters have managed to become even bigger than Nirvana. \nFormer GN'R drummer told Eddie Trunk : \"There's not too many people who actually left their established band and became very successful themselves. There's a couple: you've got Lionel Richie, Phil Collins, The Beatles of course.\" \nHe added: \"Dave Grohl is fucking god as far as I'm concerned, I hail that man! He went from the biggest band in the world to putting an even bigger band together, even bigger! He's the coolest guy as far as I'm concerned.\" \nAsked whether he'd join an established band, Steven replied: \"Hell yeah! If Aerosmith called me I'd jump right at it. Fuck, if REO Speedwagon called me I'd jump right at it, I love REO Speedwagon. Shit, if Loverboy gave me a call I'd do some shows with them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:54:00.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
