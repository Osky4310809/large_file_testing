In a period where we're looking to identify as many Creative Efficiency Opportunities as possible we've been faced with some tough choices, but the good news about that is that in lots of ways tough choices are actually easier than easy choices because there are fewer options to choose from so that's all good.” \nFilming starts next month and the third series will be broadcast on BBC Two later this year. \nShane Allen, Controller, Comedy   “It’s commendable that the team is able to increase the funniness of this series by 20-25 percent year on year, with just 54 percent of the original budget. This beautifully crafted series provides the answer to the age-old phrase: ‘If these walls could speak’ - in our case it turns out they’d talk bollocks.” \nPatrick Holland, Channel Editor BBC Two, says: \"I tried to kill this but Tony thought we should push ahead... a brilliant comedy gem returns to Two.” \nChris Sussman, Head of Comedy, BBC Studios, says: “Good communication is one of the cornerstones of the BBC, and I'm extremely pleased to be finding out about this series via this press release.” \nCommissioned by Patrick Holland, Channel Editor, BBC Two and Shane Allen, Controller, Comedy Commissioning, W1A (6x30') is written and directed by John Morton for BBC Studios. The executive producer is Jon Plowman, the producer is Paul Schlesinger. \nW1A stars Hugh Bonneville as Ian Fletcher, Jessica Hynes as Siobhan Sharpe, Sarah Parish as Anna Rampton. Jason Watkins as Simon Harwood, Monica Dolan as Tracey Pritchard and Nina Sosanya as Lucy Freeman. \nHM2 \n  BBC Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T07:01:49.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
