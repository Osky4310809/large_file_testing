So Kimmel chose some neutral ground to play to a largely white room of industry insiders: casual racism! \nLet’s go through some examples, shall we? \nFirst, there were repeated moments where Kimmel made fun of the names of people of color. \nAfter Mahershala Ali became the first Muslim actor to win an Academy Award , winning Best Supporting Actor honors for Moonlight and giving a tear-jerker acceptance speech where he thanked his wife, who just gave birth days earlier–Kimmel thought it was the right moment to mock Ali’s name, asking if the couple named their new child something “normal,” like Amy. \nYes, because moments after a black Muslim wins the Oscar for a heartbreaking, deeply felt film about coming of age as a black man in America is definitely the right time to joke about what names are “normal” (read: typically white). \nIt didn’t stop there. During a bizarre bit involving bringing a Los Angeles tour group on stage and forcing them to have contrived interactions with celebrities, an Asian woman introduced herself as Yulerie, which she reflexively clarified “rhymes with jewelry” when Kimmel starting tripping over it. \nWhen her husband introduced himself as Patrick, Kimmel jabbed, “See, that’sa name, alright.” Cool! I just think it's funny how the #Oscars is preaching love and tolerance but Jimmy Kimmel is up here making fun of people of color's names \n— Mark S. Luckie (@marksluckie) February 27, 2017 Jesus Christ Kimmel can you stop making fun of people's names, these people aren't even the famous ones \n— Nicole Chung (@nicole_soojung) February 27, 2017 \nYou can watch the whole painful, drawn-out bit here: \nKimmel also insisted on recreating an iconic scene from The Lion King with the eight-year-old Indian star of Lion, which seems like about as much workshopping as that joke got in the almost certainly lily-white writer’s room ( Lion and Lion King , cute kid, get it). \nSet aside what a massive achievement it is for Sunny Pawar to be sitting at the Oscars for his work in an acclaimed film before he’s tall enough to ride most roller coasters and feast your eyes on the raw tone-deafness of a wealthy white man using a brown child as an animal-prop. I wasn’t going to post this video of Jimmy Kimmel and Sunny Pawar… until Sunny yelled “LEMONHEADS AND MIKE AND IKES.” pic.twitter.com/vQcUov4FFz \nAbsolutely no. Let’s do better in 2017, white people. Story Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:25:14.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
