If you’ve listened to The Chainsmokers’ hit song “Closer” featuring Halsey, I just want you to know it is NOTHING like that. \nThe 4-minute track is from The Chainsmokers’ forthcoming debut album titled Memories…Do Not Open . Apparently, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin is extremely excited about the new album. \nHe made that clear back in January. excited for @thechainsmokers ' album; I've heard some songs and I love them. cm \nWhile most fans of popular EDM duo are also excited about the upcoming album, there are even more people who probably wish they never had to hear “Something Just Like This.” \nOr at least that’s what the Twitter community is hinting at! The Chainsmokers just released their latest song titled “Something Just Like This,” featuring Coldplay. For some reason, people aren’t really digging it (mostly Coldplay fans). @coldplay @TheChainsmokers please go back to making organic, alternative-rock music. You really have no idea how EPIC Parachutes is. \n— manuel guzmán (@retroglamx) February 22, 2017 Ah, “people” — they’re tough to please. I love Coldplay but I'm just not feeling their song with the Chainsmokers. \n— G e e (@georgietunley_) February 22, 2017 Even fans of The Chainsmokers had something to say about it. @TheChainsmokers y'all are good producers. Change it up! I know it's hard when this works. #originalchainsmokerfan \n— Brett Bell (@Brett_Bell2) February 22, 2017 Forget “the recording academy,” I think Twitter users might be the harshest critics musicians could ever face. This Coldplay-Chainsmokers song is not good \n— Ben Dreyfuss (@bendreyfuss) February 22, 2017 I think I might know why some people aren’t feeling The Chainsmokers/Coldplay collaboration… Hate The Chainsmokers, Love Coldplay \n— Luke the (@MagicalBerardi) February 22, 2017 Both groups just represent two different worlds! I love the chainsmokers but I hate Coldplay..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:56:52.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
