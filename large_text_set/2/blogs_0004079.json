Doon ko nilagay (You have a child. I placed their house beside mine)… Naawa ako sa apo ko (I pity my grandchild),” Duterte said in a press conference on Saturday night after visiting the tomb of his parents in Davao City. \n“ Umuwi ka na kasi iyong anak mo hindi ka na kilala (Come home because your child no longer knows you),” Duterte said. \nSebastian has a two-year-old son with a model and has a daughter with a former girlfriend. Previous reports said he recently broke up with sexy actress Ellen Adarna. Last week, Duterte revealed that Sebastian has not been going home as he spends time with Adarna. \nSebastian, for his part, told his father via social media to “chillax” and that he had broken up with Adarna.   \nThe President said he is not against the affairs of Sebastian but stressed that his son should also spend some time with his child.
