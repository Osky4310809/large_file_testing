The distance between Ugbomro and Effurun is 12miles, therefore, it is fraudulent and wrong for Effurun claiming host to FUPRE, because when former President Olusegun Obasanjo wrote to me to provide a land for the University, the people of Ugbomro gladly gave the land to the Federal Government, we have all the documents, they even surveyed the land and did not pay any compensation to our people” \nHe said Effurun community cannot claim ownership of the land, noting that it is very disturbing that Ugbomro people who own and freely donated the land to the Federal Government for the university are not recognized as host to the University by the Federal Government and management of the university.
