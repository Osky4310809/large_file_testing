And while you can’t do anything to prevent the madness, you can keep up with it using a new tool from Trigger Finance. \nOriginally a class project at Cornell Tech , Trigger makes it easy for users to set up real-time alerts when news drops about their stocks. Typically this includes notifications about upcoming earnings report announcements and news of price changes, but the startup is adding a “Trump Trigger” to ensure you’re looped in when Trump talks about your investments on his favorite social network. \nIf you’re looking for an example of Trump’s ability to influence public markets with 140 characters, look no further than yesterday’s Toyota hullabaloo . Trump threatened a nondescript tax on the company if it moved some of its production to Mexico. \nIn response, the stock dipped roughly $0.77 instantaneously on the NYSE. Not a fantastically large amount, in-fact a very small overall percentage change, but in high volumes, it matters. And more importantly, it makes a point about the cause and effect relationship between President-elect Trump and public markets. Cause Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax. \n— Donald J.

As a journalist, it’s quite useful to assist in keeping tabs on the evolving relationship between publicly traded tech companies and our soon to be President. \nTrigger Financial raised a $460 thousand angel round this time last year and is being run by Rachel Mayer, a former trader at J.P.
