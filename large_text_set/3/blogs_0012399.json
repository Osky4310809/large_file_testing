Now, today’s update eliminates that middle man. When you see a video attachment in an email, you will now see a thumbnail that, when you click it, automatically streams that video to you, without the need to download it or use a separate player.\nGoogle says that this Gmail desktop update for video uses the same infrastructure that it made for streaming YouTube videos, along with any video clips stored on Google Drive . While the update is rolling out today, it could take up to 15 days for the new video streaming feature to go live to all Gmail desktop users.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:40:23.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
