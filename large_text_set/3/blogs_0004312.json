During the interview, he gave insight into how much fun he’s been having in the City of Angels while he hustles. \n“I just come out here to have fun,” Dolph explained. “Get my vibe on, smoke my weed ’cause I like to smoke and do my thing. \nWhen questioned about the beef with Yo Gotti, he rebuffed it. \n“That’s old news,” he said. “It’s old. I just got time to play with it. I didn’t have time to play with it first. I found a little time to play with it.” \nIf that wasn’t wild enough, last week, Dolph was reportedly involved in a shooting where an alleged 100 shots were fired while he was in Charlotte, North Carolina for CIAA Tournament weekend. The SUV Dolph was reportedly riding in featured bulletproof metal and he came out unscathed. He even made some vague brags about being unstoppable on social media. \nDuring the interview, he stayed tight-lipped when asked if he thought the life-threatening event was a response to him dissing Gotti. \n“What you talking about?” asked Dolph before a light chuckle. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” \nHe did lend his opinion to the ongoing beef between Nicki and Remy and called it all entertainment. \n“It’s Hip Hop,” he said. “It’s entertainment. Definitely, if it’s nothing else, it’s entertainment. This is the entertainment business so I don’t have a side. Everybody’s watching.” \nAlongside his solo music, Dolph is still building his Paper Route Empire label and gave an update on its roster and plans. \n“Paper Route Empire man, you got Jay Fizzle, Bino Brown, Key Glock and more,” he said. “It’s a lot of them and all of them are making their own noise in their own different way. They got their own personalities and own sound. They all go crazy. I been known what’s up, so the rest of the world is going to get a whiff of this shit.” \nThrough Paper Route Empire, Dolph hopes to set a trend for future Memphis artists and says he already sees his influence on the city. \n“Hell yeah, I’ve influenced a whole lot,” he said. “A whole lot of what you see right now coming out of Memphis, it has Dolph all over it. I’m willing to help anyone who is working hard. That’s what I want to do and that’s why I do it for.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!
