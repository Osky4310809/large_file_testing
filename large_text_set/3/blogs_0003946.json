This song is really rather lovely. \nIt's been a hot minute, or six years, since Robin Pecknold and his band of emotionally charged folksters released a record, but behold! Here is one long, softly spun, nimbly plucked (is that a 12 string guitar? Yes it is!) folk-pop, along with news that FF's third album, Crack-Up, will hit the shelves on June 16th. Named after a bunch of F. Scott Fitzgerald essays, the record was written by Pecknold, who also co-produced the record with long time Fleet Fox, Skyler Skjelset.
