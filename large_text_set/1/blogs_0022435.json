Everything will be OK. Time heals.\" \nOn Monday, boxer Amir Khan has hinted his family may have leaked an explicit sex tape in his first TV interview since the footage was leaked. \nIn a live link from San Francisco, the British star and his wife, Faryal Makhdoom , clarified that their marriage remains strong - and hinted that a family member could've leaked the X-rated material. The couple discussed the recent dramas with Phil and Holly (Photo: ITV) \nChatting to Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, Faryal said: \"We're here to show that all the divorce rumours aren't true. We're not here to cause problems - we just want to show that our marriage is fine and we're doing well. \n\"But we think this happened because of what's going on. I feel like it was done by somebody close to us out of revenge.\" \nInstantly, the presenters pushed for clarification on this. \nShe responded: \"I have no idea - it could be a jealous girlfriend passing it on or a former employee who was fired from the Amir Khan foundation. I'm not saying it's a family member, but the timing is strange - it happened now for a reason.\" Amir Khan and parents (Photo: Rex) \nAmir was then quick to jump in. \"It happened a long time ago before I was married and before I became a father. It's somebody trying to put me down and dismiss all the charity work I do. It's upset me more than anything. \n\"There's a small sense of relief that it's all out there, but it upsets me because I have a young fanbase. But I'm not going to let it get to me - I'm using it as motivation\". \nFaryal then chimed in: \"Being judged over something in the past is sad. Our marriage is brilliant. It's going really well and we're really strong. Our main priority is Amir's next fight. We're just shaking it all off and being happy.\" Despite all the rumours, they insisted their marriage is strong (Photo: ITV) The defiant duo showed the haters that they're solid (Photo: ITV) https://www.instagram.com/p/BPkOFILDLvB/embed \nThen, when asked about being stuck in the middle, Amir ended the interview on a more optimistic note. \n\"It makes it very hard for me - I just want things to be back to normal. I speak to my parents now and again - things are getting better. Being in the US gives us some space to be alone. \n\"There's definitely common ground between us all. I go into the ring to fight for a better life for everyone. I want us to live like a happy famIly.\" \nEarlier in the day, Faryal herself took to Twitter where she cheerily announced her appearance on the magazine TV show. She wrote: \"Hey guys! Amir and I will be on This Morning at 10:30am UK time. Tune it to watch us!\". \nThe tweet received 76 'likes' and numerous re-tweets in a matter of minutes.
