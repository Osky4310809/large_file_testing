They have a lot of players who have been there a long time. \nOzil's agent rants about scapegoating \n\"If they don't finish in the top four I don't see a world-class player going to play for Arsenal next season. \n\"If that doesn't happen, how are they going to get in the top four next season? Man City will buy again, Man United will buy again, Chelsea will buy again. \n\"Maybe Tottenham won't because of their new stadium but Liverpool will buy again. All of a sudden Arsenal get left behind.\" Miss the press conference earlier? — Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) February 17, 2017 \nMerson thinks Wenger is as vulnerable as he has ever been at Arsenal, but wants the players to take their fair share of the blame. \nHe continued: \"I know it's been same old, same old for the last three or four years, but the other night [at Bayern] was the first time I have seen him look lost. \n\"Even in the press conference, he went in with the thought that he was in trouble. That is the first time I have really seen him like that. Usually he is quite confident and he will get out of it by saying the right words. \nFans demand Alexis ditch Arsenal \n\"Sometimes you have to draw a line, though. He takes all the stick and I'm one of those people that is probably on his back as much as anybody else. \n\"But these players are letting him down. He puts a team out and puts a lot of faith in these players who have been there for a long time - not like a year or two - these players have been at the club four, five and six years. Some even longer. \n\"They are not performing. They are letting him down and they keep on getting away with it.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:15:17.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
