The picture in turn showcases the BMW Group at a corporate level with its strong brands, BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad.\nFirst up, we see the BMW Motorrad concept motorcycle, with an emphasis placed on the visor that drivers can wear.

Next, we find the manufacturer focusing on autonomous driving, here featuring a BMW ride taking control of itself while a father interacts with his children.\nFollowing is the boxy Rolls-Royce Vision Vehicle with square casings surrounding the tires.
