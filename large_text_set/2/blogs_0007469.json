Loving her comfortable life at Edgar’s Mission Farm Sanctuary in Victoria, Australia, she is free to play with 450 other rescued farm animals on 153 acres of farmland. Living the pig’s dream , Cookie is allowed all the comforts a sweet animal like her deserves, and that includes noshing on all the strawberries she could ever want. \nSeeing the happy smile on her little pink snout while she chomps on her treat, we cannot help but smile ourselves. Pigs like Cookie are prime examples of just how relatable animals are to humans. Not only do pigs share many of our favorite snacks, but they have many emotions in common with humans as well. \nIf Cookie’s sweet face has pulled at your heartstrings, take a look at the Edgar’s Mission website and see how you can get involved with their noble (and adorable!) organization.
