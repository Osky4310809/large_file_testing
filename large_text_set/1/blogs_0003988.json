developmental programmes. \nSpeaking during a courtesy visit by the General Officer Commanding the 6 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major- General Kasimu Abdulkareem, at Government House, Port Harcourt, Wike said enhanced security would lead to the development of other sectors. \nHe said: “Let me assure you that as a government, we will continue to support the 6 Division of the Nigerian

Commanding 6 Division, Nigerian Army, Major-General Kasimu Adulkarim, during a courtesy call on the governor at Government House, Uyo. \nHe commended the new General Officer Commanding the 6 Division for the quick successes in Ogba/Egbema/ Ndoni Local Government Area, ONELGA, where cultists were uprooted. \nThe governor urged the military to step up its operations in ONELGA to dislodge the remnants of cultists who refused to accept the state’s Amnesty Programme by laying down their arms. \nHe lauded the Federal Government for establishing the 6 Division of the Nigerian Army to help fight crime in the South-South, pointing out that his administration would continue to work for the unity of the country. \nIn his remarks, General Officer Commanding, 6 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major-General Abdulkareem, informed that the new division was created on November 7, 2016 out of the 82 Division to promote regional security. \nMeantime, Governor Ayade, who spoke during the launch of 2017 Armed Forces Remembrance Emblem, said the re-capturing of the territories by the Nigerian Army had restored confidence in the lives of residents in the areas and Nigerians in general \nRepresented by his deputy, Prof. Ivara Esu, the governor maintained that his administration would continue to pay glowing tributes to the nation’s past heroes and serving officers and men of the Armed Forces. \nHis words: “The Nigerian Armed Forces recently demonstrated gallantry and capacity by reclaiming all areas previously captured by Boko Haram insurgents in the North Eastern part of the country. Many of these fallen soldiers lost their lives in the process of peace keeping while some were mortally injured and became physically incapacitated. Some families of these fallen heroes are now going through difficult times without their bread winners. Such a situation calls for sober reflection and concern on the part of every one of us as they laid down their lives so that you and I may have peace.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T10:12:10.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
