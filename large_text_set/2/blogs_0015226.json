The Detroit rapper was reportedly slapped by someone at the event in Queens, NY last night (February 17). \nTMZ says that the man was quickly apprehended by Sean Don’s body guards and then police came and arrested the man. \nIn the footage, which was also shared by The Shade Room, the man is being held to the ground as he’s handcuffed and taken away. Big Sean is standing in the background seemingly laughing off the incident and appears unharmed. \nSean released his I Decided . album earlier this month and it topped the Billboard 200 chart its debut week. The single, “ Bounce Back ” is his highest-charting track yet as it sits at #6 on the Hot 100. Other fan meet and greets have gone without incident, including his pop-up shops in support of the project.
