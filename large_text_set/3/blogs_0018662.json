The note was likely for an original demo version of “Dear Mama,” which reportedly featured a sample from Ice Cube’s “It’s A Man’s World” record featuring Yo-Yo. \nAdditionally, Tupac scribbled a grim note on the third lyric sheet. \n“Some [muthafuckerz] say that I have been raped in jail/ They want me dead for how I succeeded in rap game,” Tupac wrote. \nTMZ reports that Moments In Time received the handwritten lyric sheet from a private collector in Poland. \nFeatured in the Library of Congress because of its cultural, historical, and aesthetic impact, “Dear Mama” has garnered countless accolades. \nCreated as an ode to his mother, the late Afeni Shakur, the song topped Billboard’s Hot Rap Singles, and was certified platinum mere months after its release. \nOn “Dear Mama,” Tupac delved into his mother’s past struggle with drugs, but also applauded her for her dedication, rapping, “‘Cause when I was low you was there for me / And never left me alone, because you cared for me.” \nAfeni Shakur passed away last May at the age of 69.
