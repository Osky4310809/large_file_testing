King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 7 hours ago 6 Mark Tremonti discussed the impact that recent addition of a 7-string guitar to his musical arsenal had on his guitar playing. He told Music Radar : \"I'm still in the baby stages of learning how to get the most out of it. \"But I'm approaching as if it's a normal tuned guitar, it's just got that extra string on the bottom. I still play like it's in standard tuning but eventually I want to start going crazy with alternate tunings on that thing and keep developing. \"But that's the one thing that keeps me away from spending too much time on it. That extra string messes with me when it comes to coming up with alternate tunings. It's just that extra string that makes it more confusing once you go off the path. I've become really comfortable with going off the beaten path, coming up with alternate tunings and finding my way around. But when you add that seventh string, it's not my comfort zone. \"So I'll have to do it in small doses and see if I can come up with something great.\" Explaining how the whole thing came about, Mark noted: \"I remember getting on the phone with Myles and as usual we have this discussion where we have to decide how we're going to make this record [2016's ' The Last Hero '] a little different than what we've done in the past, keep on developing and going deeper into the rabbit hole. \"I said that one thing I want to do is try to incorporate a 7-string because it's never been my thing and it's never been something that has really inspired me that much. But I want to break it back out and see if I can find some inspiration there. \"Then Myles showed me the part of the intro for ' Show Me a Leader ' and I started playing the 7-string over it. It just added so much depth. Such a big low end and something we haven't had. We've had drop B stuff but this was even heavier sounding. Deeper sounding. \"When we play the song at soundcheck, when you hit that big F# chord - or whatever it's tuned down to, in normal tuning it would be F# - it's so big and different. That's what I love about it, just introducing new musical flavors to what we do in the band over the years.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:03:15.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
