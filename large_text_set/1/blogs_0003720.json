But instead of outfitting themselves in the mundane, both ladies kicked it up a notch by donning some pretty rad Star Wars aprons — with Gellar herself even rocking a stormtrooper mask.\nWhen @chefhomeskillet and I spend a day in the kitchen, you know that means costumes will be required \nA photo posted by Sarah Michelle (@sarahmgellar) on Jan 6, 2017 at 9:48am PST \nUm, are you trying to tell us that Buffy Freaking Summers is on the side of the Empire/First Order? Buffy, who died for humanity not once but twice , even though said humanity included Xander Harris, is with the folks that killed Han Solo?\nWe just do not buy it.\nAll jokes aside, Prinze has voiced main character Kanan Jarrus on Star Wars Rebels for years, and Gellar once voiced an Inquisitor on the show herself, so it’s no surprise that the couple has some geeky swag lying around their (very busy) kitchen. \nStill, this just reconfirms what we pretty much already knew from years of adorable interviews and social media posts from Gellar — she’s not a regular mom, she’s a cool mom.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T07:01:00.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
