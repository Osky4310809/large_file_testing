But.\n‚Äî Ana Marie Cox (@anamariecox) March 10, 2017\nHulu's 10-episode series, based on the best-selling book, follows people in a dystopia called Gilead ‚Äî a totalitarian society, once part of the U.S., rooted in twisted religious fundamentalism. It's a place where a class of women are subjugated and used only for reproduction.\nElisabeth Moss ( Mad Men) stars as one of the world's few remaining fertile women, Offred. Orange is the New Black star Samira Wiley plays Moira, Offred's best friend from college and fellow handmaid-in-training, and Alexis Bledel plays Ofglen, an ally to Offred.\nJoseph Fiennes, Yvonne Strahovski, Max Minghella, Madeline Brewer, Ann Dowd and O-T Fagbenle also co-star.\nThe series debuts on April 26. Hulu is co-hosting a Handmaid's Tale party with Twitter at SXSW.\nMeanwhile, Stripped is set to debut this summer.\nOther activations at South By include: a giant buffalo to promote American Gods, a Resistance Radio station for Amazon's The Man in the High Castle, a Twin Peaks themed restaurant called Double R Diner and a Better Call Saul pop-up of Los Pollos Hermanos.\nI once saw a movie with a giant white buffalo in it. It scared the crap out of me. #SXSW #MashSXSW #austinweird pic.twitter.com/p8letNJhzA\n‚Äî Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) March 11, 2017", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Stripped?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/sxsw?src=hash", "https://t.co/VN0JISefsq", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/austin?src=hash", "https://t.co/VkXHYzhsUI", "https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/840381829316243458", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/stripped?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/anamariecox/status/840286852464705536", "https://t.co/p8letNJhzA", "https://t.co/yB4IBO1eO0", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/sxsw2017?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SXSW?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/STRIPPED?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/austinweird?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/erica_grossman/status/840294583170936832", "https://t.co/agMmvKWilp", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MashSXSW?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Adweek/status/840650597560926209", "https://twitter.com/sxsw", "https://twitter.com/TheDealeyGroup/status/840671831447216129", "https://t.co/V1xjLR7Zyt", "https://twitter.com/Bravotv", "https://twitter.com/SPROCKIT4Glory/status/840675020875608064", "https://twitter.com/MargaretAtwood", "https://twitter.com/anthelonious/status/840299548346060802"], "published": "2017-03-12T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:21:34.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
