Very sad to report our friend and colleague @AlanColmes has passed away. \n— Shannon Bream (@ShannonBream) February 23, 2017 \nColmes died after battling a brief illness, according to his wife who issued a brief statement to Fox News: \nAlan Colmes passed away this morning after a brief illness. He was 66-years-old. He leaves his adoring and devoted wife, Jocelyn Elise Crowley. He was a great guy, brilliant, hysterical, and moral. He was fiercely loyal, and the only thing he loved more than his work was his life with Jocelyn. He will be missed. The family has asked for privacy during this very difficult time. So sad to hear of the death of Fox News colleague Alan Colmes. He and I agreed on little, but I liked him immensely. Good guy. R.I.P. \n— Brit Hume (@brithume) February 23, 2017 Just heard of death of Alan Colmes; the kind of liberal I loved-smart, witty, and fair; never backed up, but always backed up his views. RIP \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) February 23, 2017 \nColmes’ Twitter account was active under an hour ago. His account tweeted at 8:58 a.m. Thursday morning: “Jason Chaffetz finds a new way to waste your taxpayer dollars.” \nSend tips to [email protected] Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
