He was later suspended. \n“I was upset, understandably,” stated Polston. “I’ve never gotten anything less than straight A’s, so I was really interested in figuring out how to possibly improve or at least understand the grade.” \nZufari reported the student to Rollins’s “Dean of Safety” and canceled class, alleging Polston made her feel “unsafe.” \nWhen the class met again, Zufari brought up Sharia law and a male Muslim student suggested that adulterers, gays, and thieves should be decapitated, according to Polston. Multiple students thought the teacher should report the statement and one anonymous student told the FBI, but Zufari purportedly took no action beyond playfully telling the Muslim student something similar to that he was “in time-out” and should remain quiet for a bit. \nAlong with his suspension, Polston was ordered not to contact Zufari. The professor submitted a police report alleging that Polston disobeyed the order and had shown up outside of the classroom, but both a restaurant receipt and video surveillance stills indicate that the student was buying food at an Orlando restaurant during the class period. \nRollins College previously booted a Christian student group from campus because the organization required members to be Christian and endorse some conservative views, which violated the school’s anti-discrimination policy. \nThe Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to Rollins College for comment, but received no reply in time for publication.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:36:46.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
