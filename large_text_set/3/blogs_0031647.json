Diane Black. \n“The Obama rule tried to force states — including Tennessee — to send taxpayer money to abortion providers like Planned Parenthood instead of community health centers and other qualified health providers,” Black in a statement to NBC. “Title X has worked for 45 years until the Obama administration changed the rules, and this legislation will simply undo this ill-conceived change.” \nBloomberg noted that the regulation had only taken effect just days before Trump’s tenure in office began, and pointed out that an even bigger fight over Planned Parenthood could be right around the corner.
