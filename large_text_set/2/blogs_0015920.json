They found a 7 percent drop, or 134,000 fewer suicide attempts per year, in states with same-sex marriage laws, while those without them saw little change in suicide attempts. \nThe results were published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. \nThe data offer glimpse into the way public policy can affect health outcomes, said Julia Raifman, the study's lead author and a post-doctoral fellow in the department of epidemiology at the Bloomberg School. The largest declines in suicide attempts were among those teens who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. \n\"I think it is good for parents, teachers and medical professionals to be aware of the disparity and try to address it,\" Raifman said. \nThe study did not look at why the laws resulted in reduced suicide rates, but Raifman said that the acceptance of same sex marriages may make teens feel less stigmatized about their sexual orientation.
