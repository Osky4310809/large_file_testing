By Alex Hutchinson Thursday, January 5, 2017, 6:31 am Steve Snodgrass via Flickr and licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) 2.0 License \nLast March, I wrote about an ambitious new study that promised to bring some much-needed data to the contentious debate about the effectiveness of low-carb, high-fat diets—often referred to as LCHF—for endurance athletes. The results have now been published in the Journal of Physiology , and they make interesting reading (the full text is freely available here ). \nThe idea, in a nutshell, is that eating a diet consisting mostly of fat triggers adaptations that make you better at burning fat for energy. Because we all carry around ample stores of fat, transitioning to running on fat effectively solves the fueling problem for endurance athletes, eliminating the risk of bonking and the need to refuel during long races. Advertisement \nPrivacy Policy | About Us \nLast year, a team at the Australian Institute of Sport led by Louise Burke assembled an impressive group of 21 top race walkers from around the world, many of them headed to the Rio Olympics, and assigned them one or two three-week blocks of intensified training while following one of three carefully controlled diets under strict supervision: \n(1) High carb (HCHO): 60-65% carbohydrate, 15-20% protein, 20% fat, in accordance with standard sports nutrition guidelines from the 1990s. \n(2) Periodized carb (PCHO): Same overall dietary breakdown, but spread out differently from day to day so that food intake matched the needs of specific training sessions, and with some workouts performed with deliberately low carbohydrate levels in the body. This is in keeping with more recent sports nutrition guidelines , and also incorporates tactics like the “sleep low” approach I wrote about recently . \n(3) Low-carb, high fat (LCHF): 75-80% fat, 15-20% protein, less than 50 grams per day of carbohydrate in order to trigger a response called ketogenesis, which helps access energy stored as fat. \nIf you’re interested in the nitty-gritty details of the study, I highly recommend reading the paper. But I’d like to highlight three key points: \nLow-carb, high-fat boosts fat oxidation \nAfter three weeks of training on a high-fat diet, the athletes did get dramatically better at burning fat. \nHere’s some data on fat versus carb usage during a 25K walk before (white bars) and after (black bars) the three-week interventions. The panel on the left shows carbohydrate usage, and the one on the right shows fat usage. The three groups in graph are high-carb, periodized-carb, and low-carb; data are shown at the beginning, middle, and end of each 25K walk: Image courtesy of Journal of Physiology \nFor the high-carb and periodized-carb groups, nothing really changes between the before (white bars) and after (black bars) data. \nBut for the low-carb group, there’s a dramatic difference. The “after” data show a massive decrease in carb usage, balanced by a massive increase in fat usage. In fact, the fat-adapted athletes were able to sustain a fat-burning rate of 1.57 grams of fat per minute, which is 2.5 times greater than their “normal” values. \nLow-carb, high-fat hurts efficiency \nOne of the main criticisms of the LCHF approach is that, while fat stores are more abundant, carbohydrate provides more energy for a given amount of oxygen. That’s a finding that goes back to classic studies from a century ago that found a 5.5- to 8-percent edge for the energy yield of carbohydrate. \nNo one had tested this critique in a rigorous way, but the new study finds that this is exactly what happens. \nHere’s data showing the amount of oxygen needed to sustain 50K race pace for these walkers (white bars are before, black bars are after): Image courtesy of Journal of Physiology \nAgain, there’s no change for the two high-carb groups. But for the high-fat group, the amount of oxygen needed to sustain this pace gets significantly higher. That’s bad news. \nLow-carb, high-fat hurts race performance \nUltimately, as I noted in my previous article on this study, no Olympic medals are awarded for having the most interesting metabolism. What matters is how you perform in competition. The new study tested performance in a series of 10K racewalks: Image courtesy of Journal of Physiology \nAll three groups increased their VO2max during the three-week period of intense training, so you would expect to see faster races times. And sure enough, both high-carb groups improved, by an average of 190 and 124 seconds, respectively. \nIn the LCHF group, on the other hand, the gains in VO2max were countered by the decrease in efficiency. The result was no change in race time (they were 23 seconds slower, on average, a difference that wasn’t statistically significant). \nSo is this, as Burke suggested after an earlier study on fat adaptation, “the nail in the coffin” for LCHF? Almost certainly not. \nFor one thing, some LCHF proponents argue that it takes much, much longer to fully adapt to a high-fat diet (on the basis of what evidence it’s not clear). As fitness writer Matt Fitzgerald put it after the study was released, “How long does it take to ‘fat adapt’? Apparently, always one week longer than the study proving it sabotages endurance fitness.” \nStill, as Burke and her co-authors point out, there may be a difference between Olympic-bound athletes like the ones studied here and recreational ultra-endurance athletes whose goals focus more on completing the distance than sustaining near-threshold intensities or being ready to respond to high-intensity surges from competitors. At lower intensities, the negative effects on efficiency may become irrelevant. \nIt’s also worth noting that a world-class 50K race walk takes about four hours. What about races that take 10 or 15 hours, where the ability to refuel on the go is a proportionally greater limitation? \nIn the end, there are still plenty of openings where ketogenic diets might conceivably offer an advantage. But in terms of actual evidence, this study is the best we’ve got so far—and it suggests that switching to fat incurs a measurable efficiency penalty. \n***", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T10:09:37.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
