Stabbed to death: Stefan Appleton (PA) \nAlready this year two teenagers have been knifed to death in the capital — after 13 were fatally stabbed in 2016 among an overall total of 61 blade killings. \nThe dangers posed by persistent knife carriers was also highlighted by the jailing last year of 17-year-old Blaise Lewinson for hacking Stefan Appleton, also 17, to death with a Zombie Killer machete. \nLewinson was given a life term for manslaughter over the killing in an Islington park. An Old Bailey judge des- cribed him as a dangerous offender who was fascinated by illegal knives. \nThe court also heard that six months before the killing Lewinson was caught with a lock knife at a McDonald’s restaurant, despite having completed a blade crime prevention programme. \nWhile on remand awaiting trial, he was also discovered carrying makeshift weapons in prison. \nTo prevent further such tragedies, Chief Constable Hitchcock said Scotland Yard had developed an “intelligence database” of London’s most prolific knife offenders as part its strategy to reduce the peril of blade carriers on the city’s streets. Determined: Chief Constable Alf Hitchcock (PA) \n“The Met has a list of a top 50 people who are habitual knife carriers and that has allowed it to target them,” he said. \n“Officers going out on patrol will seek out those offenders and where there are reasonable grounds to search them they will do so, because they know these offenders — and you already have on the database how many times these people have carried knives and what activities they are engaged in. \n“The other thing is that if these people have other offences that are outstanding — perhaps warrants for other criminality — officers can target them with almost the Al Capone strategy, by arresting them for other offen- ces not knife-related. That is a disruptive approach. \n“The key to enforcement is to target these habitual knife carriers. Once somebody has carried once they are more likely to carry again. \n“So instead of trying to target in a more random way, target in a more focused way those people you have caught once or twice before because they are clearly not getting the message and are going to carry on doing it because it has become a lifestyle for them.” \nMr Hitchcock, Chief Constable of the Ministry of Defence Police and a former Met officer, said that most of those carrying knives were not gang members and that education remained the best way to deter most from continuing their dangerous habit. \nBut he warned that police action remained the only viable response to a minority who were “off the moral compass” and determined to carry knives to inflict violence on others. \nHe added: “There is a hard-core group who, whatever education you give them, are just not going to respond to it. They’re the habitual knife carriers. They are going to carry whatever you do. It has become their way of life. \n“They are a small but significant number. There are groups of people who are off the far right of the moral compass. They seem to think it is acceptable. They will always argue that carrying is for protection. \n\"The reality is that the majority carrying in these circumstances are not carrying for protection, they are carrying because they are more likely to be of a violent background, to be violent and more likely to commit an offence with it. \n“The only way to stop them is police enforcement.” \nChief Constable Hitchcock said another source of concern was that the “peak” age for carrying knives was “getting younger” and now ranged from “14 or 13” to about 17. \nHe said this was “quite worrying” and suggested that “you’ve got a group of people probably being influenced by their siblings, by their peer group, and carrying, which is not a good trend”. \nToday’s disclosures come as Mayor Sadiq Khan prepares to unveil a new knife crime strategy for London. He has already promised better prevention measures and tougher enforcement action against those who break the law on knife sales to juveniles.
