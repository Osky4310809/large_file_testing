Obiano’ \nAt a full house meeting of IPAC members in the state in Awka yesterday, the political parties warned that in the unlikely event that the House of Assembly failed to direct an inquiry into the alleged unlawful activities of the governor, members of all political parties in the state would occupy the Anambra State House of Assembly until justice was done. \nAccording to them, the governor and members of the state legislature should be held responsible should there be any breakdown of law and order during the occupation of the House of Assembly complex from Monday. \nEssentially, the IPAC members were complaining that: “The plans by Governor Obiano to illegally and unconstitutionally appoint caretaker/transition committees and/or liaison officers in whatsoever named called, to manage the affairs, including the finances of the 21 local councils in Anambra State, is totally unacceptable to members of all the registered political parties’ in Anambra State; and \n“Any attempt by the governor to continue in the unlawful act of diversion and misappropriation of monies accruing to the 21 local government council areas in Anambra State from the federation accounts, and any attempt also to further usurp the duty and functions of elected councilors, Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen, through the illegal and unconstitutional appointment of caretaker/transition committees and/or liaison officers in whatsoever named called, to manage the affairs including the finances of the 21 local governments.” \nObiano reacts \nBut Governor Willie Obiano last night reacted to the endorsement of his impeachment by 28 members of IPAC in Anambra State over alleged constitutional breaches, saying their action negated the reason for their existence. \nSpeaking through his senior special assistant on media, strategic communication and legislative matters, Prince Oliver Okpala, Obiano said: “We are surprised that members of IPAC in Anambra State should join the call for the impeachment of a state governor when it is aware that IPAC is not a political party and should never be partisan because their adoption of a call from a self proclaimed state PDP chairman calling for the impeachment of a governor negates the aim of INEC for setting it up as an advisory council on inter party welfare and organization.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:28:36.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
