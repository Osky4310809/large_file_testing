Many politicians did not take kindly to the president publicly ridiculing a federal judge, and they weren’t alone.

Please Mister \"so called\" President- please for the sake of humanity please grow up. Please.\n— Amanda Seyfried (@AmandaSeyfried) ID: 10467752 4. George Takei wrote some not-so-much-of-a-fan fiction. Trump: That so-called WA judge? Fire him. Staff: Sir, judges can't be fired. Trump: Says who? Staff: The Constitution. Trump: Never read it.\n— George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) ID: 10467756 5. Judd Apatow also gave his guess on what Trump was doing behind closed doors. Right now Trump is having a meeting trying to figure out how he can fire all of these judges and Federal attorneys.… https://t.co/bPebmvc5eF\n— Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) ID: 10467761 6.

Top Chef host Tom Colicchio said Trump’s reaction proved he is unfit to govern.

Actor Jeffery Wright asked the GOP to take action and remove Trump from office. If @GOP loves America you'd invoke the 25th amend before the so-called President's found under the Resolute desk mumbling tweets to himself.\n— Jeffrey Wright (@jfreewright) ID: 10467863 10. Singer Lily Allen retweeted this point by political scientist Ian Bremmer. Trump opens the door for calling him America's so-called president.

Scott Baio, for example, agreed with the president’s sentiment that the judge’s decision had put the country at risk.
