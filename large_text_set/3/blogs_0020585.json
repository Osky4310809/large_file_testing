But how do you add those images as a gallery in grid and columns instead of one picture at a time? In this article, we will show you how to easily create an image gallery in WordPress that makes your photos look even better. \n\nWordPress makes it super easy to add images to your blog posts and pages . You just click on the Add Media button and upload your images. \nHowever, if you are adding multiple images, then all those images will appear one after another. It doesn’t look great, and your users will have to scroll a lot to view them all. \n\nBy creating a gallery, you can display images in a grid layout with columns and rows. You can show thumbnails for your images, and users can click on them to see the full image. \nThis way you will be able to show more photos in less space, and it will look a lot more professional. \n\nWordPress actually comes with a built-in gallery feature that many users are not aware of. You can also use WordPress plugins to create even more robust image galleries that look great on all devices and screen sizes. \nHaving said that, let’s take a look at how to easily create an image gallery in WordPress. \nMethod 1. Create an Image Gallery without a Plugin WordPress comes with a built-in feature that lets you create a gallery. This feature is very basic and does not have many options, but it gets the job done. \nHere is how you would create an image gallery in WordPress without using a plugin. \nFirst, you would need to edit the post or page where you want to add the image gallery. On the post edit screen, click on the ‘Add Media’ button to upload your images. \n\nThis will bring up the WordPress media uploader where you can click on ‘Select files’ button to upload your photos. You can also select photos you have previously uploaded from media library. \nAfter uploading and selecting your images click on the create gallery link from the left column.. \n\nNext, you need to click on the ‘Create a new gallery’ button. \n\nMedia uploader will now show your selected images with gallery settings. You can add captions to each image in your gallery. \nYou can also select how you want the images to be linked, number of columns, and image size to use in gallery. \n\nOnce you are done, you can click on the ‘Insert gallery’ button. \nThis will close the media uploader popup, and you will be able to see your image gallery in post editor. \n\nYou can now save or publish the post/page, and visit your website to see your image gallery in action. \n\nWasn’t that quick and easy? It looks pretty too. However, if you create image galleries regularly, then you will soon notice that it lacks certain important features. \nFor example, your images will open in a new page and users will have to click on the back button to view the gallery again. It is not fully mobile-responsive, and your gallery’s appearance depends on your theme. In most cases you get just one very generic style.\nLast but not least, you can’t organize your galleries into albums, tag your images, etc.\nIf you want to add more professional looking image galleries on your site, then you should use this next method. \nMethod 2. Create an Image Gallery Using Envira For this method, we will be using the Envira Gallery plugin. It is the best WordPress gallery plugin in the market. \nEnvira allows you to easily create fully-responsive, beautiful, and modern image galleries in WordPress. It is super fast and comes with many features like lightbox popup, easy image navigation, drag and drop builder, and professional gallery templates. \nLet’s get started. \nFirst thing you need to do is install and activate the Envira Gallery plugin.
