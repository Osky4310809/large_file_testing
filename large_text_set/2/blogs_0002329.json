He was selected by the Cardinals out of Pitt with the third overall pick of the 2003 NFL Draft, and since that time has been one of the most reliable receivers in the game.\nOver his career, Fitzgerald has averaged 1,107 yards and eight touchdowns per season. Over that span, he’s missed just six games due to injury. Despite turning 33 prior to the season, Fitzgerald hasn’t declined a bit. This season, he led the NFL in receptions with 107 and posted 1,023 yards and six touchdowns.\nFitzgerald was named to the Pro Bowl 10 times, including the 2016 season. He was a first-team All-Pro in 2008, and was named second-team All-Pro in 2009 and 2011.\nThe Cardinals, and Fitzgerald, entered the 2016 season with high hopes of exceeding what the team accomplished in 2015. Last season, Arizona finished the regular season with a 13-3 record and made it all the way to the NFC Championship, but lost a 49-15 heartbreaker to the Carolina Panthers.\nPrior to the season, Arizona signed Fitzgerald and quarterback Carson Palmer to one-year extensions . Palmer and Fitzgerald’s respective ages meant there was a narrow window to win it all with their two key offensive players.\nThis season didn’t go according to plan. The Cardinals finished 7-8-1 and missed the playoffs altogether.\nFitzgerald hinted that he might look toward retirement after the Cardinals’ Week 15 loss to the New Orleans Saints.\n“I got two more games to go (this season),” Fitzgerald told Kyle Odegard of the team’s website. “I will play those games as hard as I can against two division opponents and we will see what goes on this offseason. My attention is solely focused on Seattle this Saturday.”\nThe Cardinals finished the season strong, winning their final two contests against the Seahawks and the Rams. Fitzgerald showed that he’s still got it with this touchdown in Arizona’s Week 44-6 win over Los Angeles.\nAfter the conclusion of the regular season, Cardinals wide receiver Brittan Golden said he thought Fitzgerald still had one more year in him.\n\"I think he's staying,\" Golden said on Monday, via ABC 15 . \"I think he's got one more in him. I hope he's got one more in him.\"\nAnd Fitzgerald obviously agrees. He’ll hit the field with his Cardinals teammates for one more season in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:20:01.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
