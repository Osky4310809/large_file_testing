Imgur user seventytimes generously shared selfies of her journey through acne treatment with the internet, and the simple treatment she used shocked us: it was your run-of-the-mill birth control pill.\nSeventytimes bravely revealed many photos of herself bare-faced, showing off her cystic acne . She explained that much of it was caused by ceasing her use of Prednisone, a powerful corticosteroid that treats everything from lupus and asthma to Crohn's disease. One of the unfortunate side effects of withdrawal is blemishes. \"My dermatologist was convinced I'd have to go on Accutane,\" she said.\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Accutane, it is the strongest acne medication on the market . Many have seen incredible results from taking this treatment, but it is not without risks. Not only is it severely drying to the skin, but Accutane can cause terrible birth defects, and you must commit to using two forms of contraceptives while taking it. Many women elect to use birth control pills during this time, including Imgur user seventytimes.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["http://imgur.com/user/seventytimes"], "published": "2017-03-18T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T05:15:53.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
