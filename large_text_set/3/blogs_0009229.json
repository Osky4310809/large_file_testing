Those who are blessed with this skill wield these knives quickly and efficiently. Artists need to work fast, as most fruits discolor and wilt shortly after being peeled. \nThe resultant creations, though, are pretty magnificent. They make for handsome accompaniments to meals. In Gaku's case, though, these aren’t merely aesthetic garnishes. He eats them after he’s done taking a photo of them. Advertisement \nGaku recommends that mukimono novices begin with a banana, a “cheap and easy” practice fruit, and work their way up. I’ll never even get close to working a knife with such dexterity and skill—I’m currently staring at a small gash in my thumb I got from trying to chop a carrot the other day—so, for now, I will stare longingly into all this produce.
