Big Baller Brand is a family brand. There is one B for each Ball brother. \nThe brand has clothes on deck. \nThe website has T-shirts, sweatshirts, hats and there’s even a golf shirt if you want to Ball out on the course. (That’s the last Ball pun, I promise)\nIn terms of national publicity, LaVar has been able to get the ball rolling (I lied) with all of this attention.\nHere are the Balls on Christmas. \nThen we have LaVar Ball on Diet First Take. \nBEST SEGMENT OF THE DAY: LaVar Ball was criticized for comparing his son Lonzo to Steph Curry. This is his response. pic.twitter.com/wRXSbXMKj8 \n— UNDISPUTED (@undisputed) March 7, 2017 Here he is beating Marcellus Wiley on SportsNation in basketball and then “Out- Stephen-A-Smithing” Stephen A. Smith on First Take.\nWhat do all of these appearances have in common? The man is wearing the brand in all of these appearances. You can like LaVar Ball or hate LaVar Ball, but the publicity and screen time he’s getting for him and the brand is immense.\nAfter all, who needs commercials when your face and the brand shows up on the graphics packages of national sports shows?\nHe even gets to sport the gear on the graphics package. \nHe not even there and he gets to show off the merch. pic.twitter.com/5u7IscO6TC \n— Kofie (@KofieYeboah) March 23, 2017 The only person I’ve ever seen stunt in one look more is Waldo. (Side Note: LaVar is way easier to find.)\nHow will this massive publicity work for the brand? Will it gain more traction when Lonzo Ball enters the NBA? I have no idea, but I have witnessed a brick with the word “Supreme” on it sell, so nothing surprises me anymore. \nOnly time will tell.\nIs the brand getting attention? Well, it already has a healthy following on Instagram and Twitter and you just read my words covering how LaVar Ball is being covered. \nDamn he’s good.\nYou may be tired of hearing about LaVar Ball (I feel you), but right now he is getting attention. It’s kind of hard to avoid seeing it on Facebook and Twitter because the stories are everywhere. \nWill it continue? Will it wear off? Find out on the next episode of DRAGON BALL Z!\nSo I’ll see you guys in 2019 when I’m wearing my Air Big Baller 1’s to the court. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:47:14.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
