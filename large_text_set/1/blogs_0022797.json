But if you’re like me, it only takes one adorable baby animal to wash away all of those stressful feelings-if only for a few moments. Well, guess what time it is?\nOur latest bundle of cuteness comes the Cincinnati Zoo. A two-day-old hippo born six weeks early took her first dip in the pool and cameras were on hand to capture the fun. “Her care team continues to give her 24-hour attention, which includes tube-feedings, vet checks and keeping her warm and moist,” the video’s caption read. “She is gaining some strength. This morning she got her first pool experience. Most hippos are born in the water, but they can’t actually swim. Pool time will help her build muscles and balance and maintain an optimal body temperature of 96-98 degrees.”\nAfter checking in for updates (aka stalking the zoo’s Instagram), I learned that her name is Bibi and she’s getting stronger thanks to the nutrients from her mother’s milk. “Because Bibi was conditioned to lean in and remain still for weekly ultrasounds throughout her pregnancy, she is comfortable walking into a chute and allowing milk to be collected. The calf’s care team, which includes vets, nursery and animal staff, give her mom’s milk first and supplement with formula prepared by the Zoo’s nutritionist,” the caption read .\nWonderful!\n(via Mashable , image via Cincinnati Zoo )\nWant more stories like this?
