I don’t know what your reputation is in this town, but after that s@?# you pulled, you can bet l’ll be looking into you!”\nI don’t know who is doing Tom Brady’s social media these days, but they’ve been absolutely killing it .\nScrew making a movie about the Patriots historic Super Bowl comeback , I want to see a film about this goddamn jersey and the epic adventure it’s been on the past few weeks.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:09:26.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
