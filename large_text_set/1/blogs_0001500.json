After he asked each cross be lifted up, he said: “This is not Arlington National Cemetery. This is Chicago.” \n“This is not a West Side problem. This is not a South Side problem. This is a Chicago problem,” the St. Sabina pastor added. \nSome crosses, though, went unclaimed. Pfleger said those would be returned to Zanis’ home and the victims’ families could get them at any time. Gallery \nThe group walked north on Michigan in solemn near-silence, except for people who took turns reading the names of those killed this year. \nAfter stopping at the intersection of Chicago and Michigan to pray, the march turned around to go back south. As the group approached Ontario, a Chicago Police sergeant told a street performer, covered in silver paint, to turn off his techno music until the march had passed. \nCaroline Hurley was there for her son, Isaiah , who was shot to death in North Lawndale in October. She, too, took solace in the number of people who participated in the march. \n“It’s comforting, but then it’s also sad,” she said. \nHer son had three children at the time he was killed, though Hurley said, “They’re babies, so they don’t really understand.” \nHurley said her son had a great sense of fashion, and she chose to wear a pair of his pants to the march. \nThe marchers fully reconvened in the northbound lanes of Michigan just north of the Chicago River, which allowed police to reopen southbound traffic. \nStanding on a planter and flanked by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Pfleger thanked those who attended, conceding that New Year’s Eve may not be the easiest day to attract attendees to a march to memorialize murder victims. \n“When I put this out, I recognized that this is New Year’s Eve. I recognized that people are doing a lot of different things. But I thank you for responding,” Pfleger said. “This is what it’s going to take to solve this: Every single one of us.” Previously from Chicago News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T01:12:31.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
