It's the center of tech, innovation, art and creativity. Don't forget its geographic beauty and easy access to world-class wine, food and nature.\nBut even I have to acknowledge that my hometown and surrounding area, famously known for its startups and giant Silicon Valley companies, is also an unsustainable rental market.\nSEE ALSO: How Tim Ferriss, Pat Flynn, and Mimi Ikonn hack their lives in 5 minutes a day\nBecause it's so expensive to settle down here, one tech company is taking a new approach to the high cost of living. Zapier, an apps integration and automation company, is offering its employees $10,000 to leave.\nThat's $10,000 to \"de-locate\" and work from anywhere other than the Bay Area. Take the money and never look back.\nIn a blog post last week, CEO and co-founder Wade Foster said because \"it can be a real challenge to turn the Bay Area into a life-long home rather than a short stop somewhere in our twenties and thirties\" they are offering the incentive package to pack up and go.\nFor employees living in SF and other pricey Bay Area cities, this is like a relocation package, but away from the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\"[We] think you should be able to work wherever you want and still work at a place that helps you achieve your career goals,\" the CEO said about the company that encourages remote working.\nMost people seemed pretty into this new-fangled work set-up.\nWow, this is a first. https://t.co/Y5LKw1OkDi\n— Paul Graham (@paulg) March 17, 2017\nZapier has a fascinating business model, and company culture, and this is a great move: https://t.co/0gRDi1w9i5\n— Brendan Cronin (@bpcronin) March 18, 2017\n. @zapier , this is a pretty good move to help save San Francisco from itself. And that city's tech sector really needs to give back.\n— Henry Faber (@henryfaber) March 18, 2017\n@semil Great move! It is just not clear though if @zapier still pays Bay Area salaries on top of the de-location package...\n— Sebastien Mirolo (@seabasscapoeira) March 18, 2017\nZapier to pay new hires $10k to move *out* of SF. Hoping this idea spreads—SF rent *and* salaries are just silly. https://t.co/rhp23Fbj8N\n— Jonnie Hallman (@destroytoday) March 20, 2017\nFoster added that the company is experimenting with \"de-location\" so for now this is only for SF-based employees, but it could possibly expand to other workers living in other expensive parts of the country.\nOf course people from outside San Francisco immediately had recommendations of where everyone should move (or avoid).\n@hurrrdurrr I'd suggest Kansas City. Affordable, cool, and Google Fiber. You should move here. @zapier\n— Mike Whelan (@mikewhelanjr) March 18, 2017\nGood for @zapier , helping employees move to optimal locations.
