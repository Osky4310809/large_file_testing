And now that Donald Trump is the president, people need to focus their efforts on pressuring Congress to stop the “very disturbing things” he wants. \nTodd pointed out that some people might resist such calls to action from “establishment” figures like himself, and he asked Mook if the Clinton campaign made a mistake in focusing too much on the analytics. \nAfter all, Todd noted, there was a “failure of imagination” on the part of the press to imagine a path to victory for Trump. Mook conceded that may have been true of them too, but still pointed to that infamous FBI letter. \nWatch the full segment above, via MSNBC. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:14:47.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
