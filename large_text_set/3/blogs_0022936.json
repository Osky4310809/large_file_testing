Fans have complained on some occasions that they have paid a premium price to see stars play, then arrived at arenas only to find that those players are getting the game off. \nIt also can't sit well with the networks that paid $24 billion to the NBA in the latest television contract negotiations. \n\"Please also be reminded that under current league rules teams are required to provide notice to the league office, their opponent and the media immediately upon a determination that a player will not participate in a game due to rest,\" Silver wrote. \"Failure to abide by these rules will result in significant penalties.\" \nThe Warriors chose to rest Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala for a nationally televised game against San Antonio on March 11. Coach Steve Kerr said he did it in response to a grueling stretch of the schedule that included eight games in eight different cities in 13 days. \n\"It's my call, and it's the right thing to do in terms of the way the season is playing out and the way the minutes have gone and (Kevin Durant's) injury,\" Kerr said when he announced the decision after a game against Minnesota the previous night. \"It's the right thing to do, so we're doing it.\" \nLeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love rested for Cleveland against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night, though Irving and Love were both dealing with recent injuries. \nIt is not a new issue, though Silver noted that its frequency has escalated this season. \nSan Antonio was fined $250,000 by then-NBA commissioner David Stern in the 2012-13 season when coach Gregg Popovich sent Danny Green, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili home for rest on Nov. 29, 2012, rather than having them play Miami in the final game of a six-game road trip. \nStern said the fine was due to a litany of transgressions, but primarily because San Antonio did not alert the league or media of the players' unavailability prior to the game. Since then, the Spurs have announced in advance which players will rest. \nSilver has said the league is very sensitive to players needing as much rest as possible to perform at their best and avoid injury. The league will start the regular season earlier next year so it can reduce the number of back-to-backs and stretches of four games in five nights that teams face.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:25:59.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
