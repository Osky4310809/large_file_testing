(Timothy Clary/AFP/Getty Images) \nA group of nearly 100 tech companies have filed an amicus brief to a federal appeals court voicing concerns over President Donald Trump's stalled immigration-focused executive order. \nGoogle, Apple, GoPro, Facebook, Dropbox, eBay, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix and Twitter were among the dozens of companies that filed the brief in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in support of a challenge by the states of Washington and Minnesota to Trump's travel ban. \nAfter a federal judge in Seattle suspended implementation of the ban on Friday, the appellate court on Sunday shot down the Trump administration's request to immediately reimplement the prohibitions affecting travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and refugees seeking admission to the U.S. The ban was put in place through an executive order signed by Trump on Jan. 27, and since has been the target of multiple lawsuits. \nThe Trump administration is expected to file its next argument with the appellate court by 6 p.m. Eastern time Monday. RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Trump to Begin Dodd-Frank Rollback With Executive Order ] \nAn amicus brief literally translates to \"friend of the court\" and is usually filed by third-party individuals or groups to offer perspective and weigh in on a particular issue before a court. The tech cavalcade isn't so much suing the Trump administration as it is voicing concerns about what the controversial order would mean for their businesses and future immigration patterns. \nThe document filed Sunday night argues that the order \"inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation and growth,\" \"disrupts ongoing business operations,\" \"threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business and investment to the United States\" and ultimately is \"contrary to law.\" \nA few names in the group of nearly 100 particularly stick out. For example, Uber – whose CEO, Travis Kalanick , withdrew from a White House advisory position last week, citing his opposition to Trump's executive order – and PayPal, whose co-founder, tech investor Peter Thiel, has for months been a Trump supporter, both got in on the brief. \nThiel, for what it's worth, is no longer associated with PayPal, and a spokesperson for the tech billionaire told Forbes last month that Thiel \"doesn't support a religious test, and the administration has not imposed one.\" RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Report: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to Resign From Trump Advisory Council ] \nAlong with applying specifically to seven majority-Muslim countries, Trump's order intends to allow officials to make case-by-case exceptions for a refugee who, for example, is part of \"a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution.\" \nYet while the order has been criticized, recent polls have suggested around half of the country supports the move, with a similar proportion opposing it. Trump tweeted Monday that \"any negative polls are fake news\" and that \"people want border security and extreme vetting.\" \nThe president also loosed his Twitter venom over the weekend at the \" so-called judge \" in Washington who stalled the execution of his order nationwide. \n\"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system,\" Trump tweeted . \"People pouring in. Bad!\" RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Unchanged ] \nThe amicus brief's filing comes roughly a week after a group of Silicon Valley representatives convened to discuss options to address the travel restrictions. The gathering was reportedly organized by software development outfit GitHub, and representatives from several companies included on the brief – such as Google, Netflix and Airbnb – were expected to be in attendance. \nNot included on the filing were companies like SpaceX and Amazon. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk continues to serve in an advisory capacity to the Trump administration, though he has publicly expressed displeasure with the implementation of the travel restrictions. \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, meanwhile, was critical of Trump during election season and has also spoken out against the immigration restrictions. His company filed a declaration supporting the Washington lawsuit, though it does not appear to have been involved in the brief. \nThe tech sector employs a relatively high concentration of immigrants and brings in thousands of skilled workers from overseas each year through the H-1B visa system, so its sector's executives historically have been sensitive to immigration issues. \nA report published last year stated that more than 37 percent of workers in Silicon Valley are foreign-born.
