It had the contract for those troubled Silverliner V cars that were yanked from service last summer because of defective parts. \nREAD: Man Arrested For Assaulting SEPTA Bus Driver \nSEPTA spokesman Andrew Busch says that discovery made the Authority press the pause button for this current procurement. The Request For Proposals was amended, and SEPTA will bring in EWI, formerly known as the Edison Welding Institute, to make sure the work is done right. \n“We’re going to have an outside consultant that will oversee the welding that’s done because of the issues with the Silverliner V’s,” Busch said. \nWhile the shells of the coaches will be manufactured in China, Busch says the bid does meet “buy America” requirements. \n“At least 60% or more of the parts, labor and fabrication are done in the US,” he said. \nCRRC is building an assembly plant in Springfield, Massachusetts, where it also has a contract to build subway cars for the MBTA in Boston. \nDelivery of those multi-level coaches to SEPTA is expected to begin in the fall of 2019. \nThe Secretary Treasurer of Transport Workers Local 234, Joe Coccio, says SEPTA’s decision, which he calls “un-American,” will result in the elimination of 150 jobs at Hyundai Rotem’s South Philly plant, sending that work overseas.
