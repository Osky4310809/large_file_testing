The service was first introduced in November last year. \nOn a separate matter, Ab Aziz said the government would only allow Uber and Grab services to operate using smartphone applications, with laws to regulate the ride-hailing services set to be tabled in Parliament on March 6. \nHe was commenting on taxi touts that abused Uber and Grab platforms at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). “Uber and GrabCar use virtual applications, they (regular drivers) cannot be ulat (touts) because they need to be registered (on the respective platforms),” he said. \n“At the KLIA terminal, we already have enforcement by JPJ (Road Transport Department) and SPAD (Land Public Transport Commission) in collaboration with MAB (Malaysia Airports Berhad) as the administrator there,” he added.
