The club still won’t comment about the project, which is part of $248 million in improvements at Midway. Other applications include Schaller’s Original Pump—the legendary South Side bar—and Decolores Burrito Joint. Officially, the project is listed on the city license application as White Sox Sports Bar & Grill. Again, there’s no details, yet. Hopefully, it’s similar to the restaurant outside of the stadium formerly called Comiskey Park. The ChiSox Bar & Grill is operated by Gibsons Restaurant Group. One change appears to be Tabo Sushi, the brand from chef Takashi Yagihashi (Slurping Turtle). Tabo appears to have replaced the rumored addition of beloved West Town sushi restaurant Arami. Now, it’s certainly possible that Midway could have both Tabo and Arami, but it’s also very unlikely as there’s no Arami application present at this time. Budweiser parent AB InBev will also have branded bars from two of its assets, Goose Island and Stella Artois. These aren’t all the new Midway restaurants planned, only the ones that will serve booze. Other liquor license applications for Midway include: Home Run Pizza", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:04:01.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
