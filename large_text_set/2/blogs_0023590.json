However, you aren't supposed to board the train unless there are enough cancellations to at least get RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation) status. \nHow do you know if there will be enough cancellations? Or how do you know if you will get a confirmed ticket? \nUnfortunately, it can be hard to predict. Some trains have more cancellations than others. In addition, some compartments (such as sleeper and 3A ) have more seats than others. \nNot knowing if you'll be able to travel makes it hard to plan the rest of your trip. \nThere are a couple of easy ways to find out the likelihood of your waitlisted ticket being confirmed (or even advancing to RAC status). And they're fast, free, and reliable. India Rail Info Website Go to the India Rail Info website and sign up. Go to the PNR Forum tab. \ncontinue reading below our video Beware!

Understanding How the Waitlist Works \nA bit of knowledge about how the waitlist system works helps in being able to predict the likelihood of getting a ticket confirmed. It's a complex system and not all waitlists are equal! Factors such as rate of cancellations, type of waitlist, quotas, frequency of trains, distance covered, and of course class of travel will all have an impact. \nThe Numbers \nWhen you go to book a waitlisted ticket, it will show two numbers. For example: WL 115/45. The number on the left indicates the length that the waitlist has gone up to. The number on the right indicates the current position of the waitlist. In the example, there have been 70 cancellations so far, and there are 45 people ahead of you on the waitlist. This gives you an idea of the rate that people cancel their tickets and how quickly (or slowly) the waitlist will move. \nYour waitlisted ticket will also show two numbers. For example: WL 46/40. The number on the left is your position on the waitlist when you bought the ticket. The number on the right is your current position on the waitlist. \nThe time that you're scheduled to travel will have considerable impact on whether or not you'll get a confirmed ticket. People are less likely to cancel tickets during festivals, on weekends, on overnight journeys, and on long distance trips (especially when trains run less frequently). \nThe Importance of Quotas \nIn addition, it's important to take into account quotas. Indian Railways trains have various quotas set aside for specific individuals. These include Foreign Tourists, Ladies, Physically Handicapped, and Defense Personnel. \nThe quotas can take up a large block of seats. However, they don't exist on all trains. If the quotas don't get filled (which is often), the empty seats are released to the general public on the waitlist when the train's chart is prepared. This is about four hours before departure. It's possible to check the number of seats kept aside under various quotas on the India Rail Info website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:35.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
