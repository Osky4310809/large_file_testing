We are aware of the issue with migrating @POTUS followers and investigating. More soon. \n— Twitter Support (@Support) January 21, 2017 \nAs reported earlier, all the tweets from Obama’s term as president were archived under the new Twitter account, @POTUS44, and his then 13 million-plus followers were also migrated. (The account is up to over 14 million at the time of writing.) In addition, Obama’s followers were also set to automatically follow the new @POTUS account, now operated by the Trump team. \nThe same process took place for the @FLOTUS and @VP accounts, which were archived to @FLOTUS44 and @VP44, respectively. \nIt’s possible that some of the Twitter complaints are related to a misunderstanding about how this transition process works. They may not have been aware that they were going to be auto-followed to Trump’s @POTUS account when he took office. \nWhat’s odd, though, is that some users are claiming they had never followed the @POTUS account, even during Obama’s term. \nIn other cases, they’re saying they had unfollowed the account ahead of Trump’s ownership, in order to not be migrated. Some even said they had blocked the account – a clear indication they didn’t want to see Trump’s tweets going forward. @sarahintampa I can confirm that I had never followed POTUS, FLOTUS or VP but was forced to Follow all three. \n— Jimi Kunkel (@JimiKunkel) January 21, 2017 \nBut for whatever reason, their account automatically followed the @POTUS account anyway. (People seem less upset about being autofollowed to @FLOTUS and @VP accounts, but those are also mentioned in a number of tweets.) \nOf course, it’s also possible that a handful of these users have a faulty memory. But there were too many complaints about the glitch for it to be a coincidence. It definitely looks like some kind of Twitter goof. \nHere’s a sample: @xfsista @Amy_Marie97 Holy shit, I just checked — Twitter autofollowed the Cheeto for me! (I made a DEFINITE point of unfollowing last nt!) \n— Jose Molina (@JoseMolinaTV) January 21, 2017 Just checked it, @Twitter autofollowed AFTER I'd blocked the new acct. That's dirty, Twitter. Real dirty. https://t.co/QaHUy5rhEF \n— Rachel Kambury (@rkambury) January 21, 2017 Check your feed. Twitter autofollowed @potus after I blocked/reported the account today.
