Leitch said in an interview Saturday she hadn’t seen it coming.\n“I told him from day one if he needed a break that his health and his family came first. And I know how hard he was working, he put a huge amount of time and effort into my campaign so when he called me and said he had to step aside because it was just too stressful, you know obviously I respect that decision,” she said.\nBrett Gundlock / National Post Nick Kouvalis in 2010 when he was campaign manager for Rob Ford. “I hope he receives the help that he needs and I’ll continue with a great strong team that I have.”\nAmid speculation over Kouvalis’s next move, Leitch said she believes he wouldn’t move over to another candidate’s team. “I know he won’t,” she said. “Not that he made a promise to me. Just, he’s a loyal person.”\nLeitch said her campaign still has 1,500 volunteers and “we’re going to continue going in the same direction we have been up until now,” which she described as a campaign focused on talking to average people about their concerns.\nShe wouldn’t comment on whether she agreed with Kouvalis that he was distracting from her campaign.\nLiam Richards/CP Federal Conservative leadership candidate Kellie Leitch “Politics is a team sport and you make a strategy and you implement it just like you do if you’re playing on a football team or on an ice rink for hockey. … You’re loyal to your teammates.”\nKouvalis had been the focus of some media coverage about Trump-style campaign tactics and alt-right language on social media.\nMeanwhile, Leitch herself has continued to focus heavily on her signature policy idea — to enforce an interview for every immigration application, which would screen for “Canadian values.”\nLeitch faces Kevin O’Leary for the first time Saturday night at a debate in Halifax — someone she says is “10 out of 10 on personality” but “zero out of 10 on policy.”\nThere are 14 candidates in total. A new leader will be chosen May 27.\nEmail: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: mariedanielles \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:09:57.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
