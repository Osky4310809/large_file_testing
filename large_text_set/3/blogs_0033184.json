They now also have to contend with this legal challenge filed Thursday. \nEnvironmental groups that have opposed the project from the beginning are now sticking to their guns. \n“We’ve stopped the toxic Keystone XL Pipeline once, and we will do it again,” Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network said in a statement, adding that the Trump administration should “expect far greater resistance than ever before.” \nA plethora of environmental groups filed the legal challenge in Montana claiming that more environmental scrutiny is needed. They are concerned that the pipeline could potentially contaminate ground and surface water. \nThe groups include the Center for Biological Diversity, Bold Alliance, Friends of the Earth, Northern Plains Resource Council, Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club. The coalition say that an environmental review of the pipeline, completed in 2014, is inadequate and outdated and that it minimizes or ignores significant environmental impacts of the project. \nVia RT .
