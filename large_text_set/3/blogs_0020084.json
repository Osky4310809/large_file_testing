Some themes during the funeral Mass and service were heard over and over: gentleman, classy, caring, loving.\nBut maybe Knicks and NBA announcer Mike Breen, who, in quoting a fan, summed up best why there was such an outpouring of love and respect for the man known as “Johnny Hoops.”\n“He was one of us,” said Breen.\nAndariese, who died March 13 at the age of 78 at his Florida home after a long battle with dementia, was just that. Celebrities like Breen, Marv Albert and NBA commissioner Adam Silver plus family members, including his wife, Maureen, and friends spoke about the regular-guy ways of the Naismith Hall of Fame member. Andariese, who called Knicks games on TV and radio for nearly 35 years, was part of the city sports fabric.\nSEE ALSO \nJohn Andariese's last partner: His voice was New York 0:0 Knicks radio man Mike Crispino was there toward the end... “John was a dear friend and he was as connected with New York basketball as any of the great legends. He’s right up there with Willis and Patrick and Bernard,” Silver said. “He was one of the most generous people with his time. People always stopped him on the street, wanted to hear his views on the Knicks but also just wanted to talk basketball and tennis with him. He was a big tennis aficionado as well. He always had an incredible, generous spirit.”\nSilver laughed how he referred to Andariese as “Johnny Suits” because of the broadcaster’s well-known affinity for stylish dress.\nAlbert, one of those partnered on Knicks broadcasts with Andariese, noted how he will miss talking about basketball and each other’s kids with his friend.\n“But most of all, John, I will miss you terribly,” Albert said.\nAndariese, from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, starred at St. Michael’s then Fordham, twice playing in the NIT. The winner of multiple local Emmy Awards, Andariese belongs to the St. Michael’s, Fordham and New York City basketball halls of fame. In 2014, he won the Curt Gowdy Media Award for broadcasting, ensuring enshrinement in Springfield.\n“It is appropriate that we are all here on the campus of Fordham University where ‘Johnny Hoops’ played college ball,” Albert said. “It is truly an honor for me to be asked to talk about the 53rd leading rebounder in Fordham basketball.”\nFamily members and friends attend the funeral service for John Andariese on Tuesday at Fordham University. Andrew Theodorakis There were jokes throughout. Matt McLaughlin, a son-in-law who spoke on behalf of Andariese’s three daughters — Amy, Emily and Julie — recalled his first date with now-wife Amy. They went to a Knicks game. Later he met Andariese, who that night gave his daughter tickets to the All-Star Game.\n“And it was at that point I knew I was in love with John,” McLaughlin said.\nTom Ashley said Andariese was more than just a friend for 46 years.\n“I never had a big brother but I did after the first meeting with John,” Ashley said.\nBreen, who red-eyed home with MSG colleagues from California after the Knicks played Monday night, spoke glowingly of his well-dressed friend.\n“I think of a man who had a life-long love affair with the game of basketball, was able to share that love with generations of Knicks fans and was a true gentleman every step of the way,” Breen said.\nSEE ALSO \nJohn Andariese, beloved Knicks broadcaster, dead at 78 0:0 Words were hard to come by for Marv Albert on... Father Peter Connelly, a Benedictine priest and longtime family friend who celebrated the funeral Mass, recalled Andariese as a loving husband and father.\n“I came here to honor a great man, a wonderful man. I am full of gratitude for having known John Andariese,” Connelly said.\nMaureen Andariese gave the final tribute after thanking those in attendance, including former and current members of the MSG and Knicks hierarchy.\n“Thank you all for everything,” she said. “And thank you to Johnny, the love of my life.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:30:20.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
