And would be a total badass,” she told The Associated Press in one of a series of exclusive interviews. “I’d like to think she’d be listening to classic rock, playing sports, and putting up with no nonsense.” \nBut when asked about what she remembers about Caylee’s last moments, Casey said that she’s “still not even certain as I stand here today about what happened.” \nThe story of Caylee Anthony’s death has caused major outrage and bafflement around the world on account of the mother’s seemingly lack of knowledge about the goings-on in her daughter’s life during the last month she was reported missing. The case turned more bizarre when her defense involved an accidental drowning for which there was no eyewitness testimony. Based on the details of the case, and how its proceedings determined without any shadow of a doubt that Casey Anthony was lying for most of her defense, the media shared the consensus that Casey was the one responsible for her daughter’s death, despite the lack of evidence. \n“Based off what was in the media, I understand the reasons people feel about me. I understand why people have the opinions that they do,” Anthony said. \nThe two-year-0ld Caylee Anthony was last seen on June 16, 2008 and was reported missing by Casey’s mother on July 15. A day later, Anthony was arrested for child neglect. She would later tell the police that her daughter disappeared with the babysitter. \nOn December 11 a utility worker who worked at the wooded area near Anthony’s home found skeletal remains that were later identified as Caylee’s. Experts also studied air samples near the area and discovered that decaying human remains were present in Casey’s trunk. \nThe trial was able to prove that Anthony was a liar, but there was no sufficient evidence to prove anything else. Investigations into the case failed to determine how Caylee died, and investigators couldn’t find her mother’s DNA on the duct tape that was used to suffocate her. After a month and a half of trial, it took the jury less than 11 hours to find Casey not guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter, and aggravated child abuse. \nDespite the results of the case, the Florida Department of Children and Families still concluded that the mother was responsible for Caylee Anthony’s death, saying that her “actions or the lack of actions… ultimately resulted or contributed in the death of the child.” And as The Inquisitr reported a couple of days ago, former Circuit Judge Belvin Perry Jr., the judge who presided at the trial, said that the mother may have inadvertently killed Caylee Anthony when she used chloroform to try to calm her. Not only did Casey Anthony \"accidentally\" kill her daughter with chloroform, she also \"accidentally\" forgot to cry over child's death. pic.twitter.com/cr47cZI9n2", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T12:28:00.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
