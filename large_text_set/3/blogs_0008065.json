Do they actually make your life any easier? \nIf you see a set of staircases, you think, “Ah, OK, I’m going to have to climb these.” \nBut if you see a broken down escalator that is now a staircase, you think, “Goddamn it. It’s broken and now, I have to walk like a PLEB?!” \nOr, perhaps, it is working, but there are idiots on it who don’t understand the left hand side is for those who want to walk up the escalator and go at warp speed, and the right side is for a casual rider. \nEither way, it enrages me. But my rage is also fueled by fear. \nEscalators are a goddamn death trap. \nFirst, there was this absolutely horrifying footage of a mother saving her young son before an escalator killed her . She was pronounced dead at the scene, but it took hours to free her from the gears. \nIn fact, this wasn’t an isolated incident . \nAnd if you want more fuel for your totally rational fear of moving stairs, besides your mom warning you about getting your shoelace stuck in one and it CHEWING YOUR FOOT OFF, a young woman was left injured after an escalator cut her leg. \nThe footage is not for the faint of heart… \nOK, yep, you will never catch me on an escalator. \nI’m sticking to the stairs FOREVER. \nThankfully, it looks like this girl is just missing a chunk of her leg. I mean, I’m not a doctor, but it looks like it can be reattached. \nOh, God. Just thinking about this is making my legs quiver. \nYou remember when you were a kid and you were like, “Mommy and Popsicle! I’m going to be a doctor!” and they laughed because you were very stupid? \nAt least, I now know not only did stupidity keep me from following that career path, but I would not be able to face things like this in real life.
