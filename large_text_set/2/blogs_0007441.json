Her demeanor is very similar to that which many abused dogs display – she looks demure, frightened, simply unsure what is about to happen next and whether she should trust the people around her. Fortunately, she now can trust that no one will hurt her ever again – and the team that is taking care of her is doing everything to make her know it. \nStarla was found in south Texas, at the bottom of a river canal where she had been abandoned . She was excessively skinny and paralyzed due to an injured back. But that is not all – she was also pregnant. Because of her limited mobility, she was an easy prey to predators. This story could have had a tragic ending, but, fortunately, the dog was taken under the wings of the S.N.A.R.R Animal Rescue Northeast team. \nBecause of the pregnancy, Starla’s recovery will be much more complicated, but she is incredibly resilient and seems to want to fight for her own and her puppies’ lives. She has already resumed some movement in her legs which gives much hope for her future recovery! \nStarla is now being treated and rehabilitated at the S.N.A.R.R Animal Rescue Northeast in Dallas. The team is determined to do all that is in their power to bring this beautiful dog back to health and save her babies, but they need financial help to provide her with the many medications she requires.
