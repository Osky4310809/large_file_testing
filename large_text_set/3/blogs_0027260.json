Ms Koike, a former newscaster, has blamed corruption for the spiralling cost of the Olympic Games, which Tokyo will host in 2020. Her warning that spending on the event could top ¥3trn ($27bn), over four times the original estimate, has alarmed voters. “People see her on television every night fighting for them and they like her for it,” says Katsuei Hirasawa, an LDP politician. Ms Koike’s showdown with Shintaro Ishihara, another LDP rebel who ran the capital from 1999 to 2012, has also caught the public’s imagination. Ms Koike blames Mr Ishihara for approving the relocation of Tsukiji, the world’s biggest fish market, to the toxic site of a disused gas works. The frail ex-governor has been summoned to the city assembly in a potentially humiliating probe that could widen to include his links to a failed bank. During the election for governor last summer, Mr Ishihara said that running Tokyo could not be left to “a woman with too much make-up”. But calculation, not revenge, motivates Ms Koike, says Michael Cucek, a political blogger. “Her aim is to wipe out the LDP old guard.” In this she is following the lead of Junichiro Koizumi, Japan’s prime minister from 2001 to 2006. Mr Koizumi also cultivated young candidates, dubbed “assassins”, to supplant opponents within the LDP blocking his attempt to trim public spending and privatise Japan’s giant post office. The injection of fresh blood helped to reinvigorate the party and vindicate Mr Koizumi. But even a convincing win in Tokyo would not give Ms Koike the sort of political machine she would need to take on the LDP nationwide. Instead, she may hope to parlay her insurrection into a return to the heights of the party. In 2008 she stood for the leadership, which would have brought with it the job of prime minister, but lost to Taro Aso. There are few obvious candidates to succeed the current prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Ms Koike’s lack of a clear ideology is no handicap: the LDP itself, after all, flirted with austerity under Mr Koizumi but now runs one of the world’s most spendthrift governments. She has been cultivating alliances. Komeito, the LDP’s coalition partner at the national level, agreed earlier this month to support her candidates in July. Several LDP politicians have also rallied behind the governor, earning their expulsion from the party’s Tokyo chapter. The governor herself is protected from the LDP’s retribution by her popularity. Casting her out would only make the party look scared and vindictive, says Robert Fahey, a contributor to Sankei Shimbun , a newspaper. The party’s grandees are probably waiting to see how Ms Koike’s protégés fare, says Mr Hirasawa. Whatever happens, she is already Japan’s most popular politician; if her luck holds, she could one day be its leader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T09:29:35.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
