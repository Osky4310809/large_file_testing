While it might not be an official book club, we’re definitely joining in.\nOn Sunday, Roberts posted a photo of herself in a giant bookstore, proving she is in fact a HUGE bookworm. This picture got us to thinking about all of the fabulous books that the Scream Queens star reads and shares on social media.\nYou might not have noticed, but the 25-year-old actress is always reading. Better than that, she’s always posting pictures using the hashtag, #currentlyreading, and now we’re taking notes.\n\nA photo posted by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Feb 5, 2017 at 11:41am PST \nWhile looking at Robert’s Instagram account we’ve found seven books she’s read in the last year that you need on your book list ASAP.\n1.

Still Life with Woodpecker by Tom Robbins \nA book I always come back to #stilllifewithwoodpecker \nA photo posted by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Dec 12, 2016 at 8:14pm PST \nThis novel is one that the actress always finds herself coming back to, which makes us want to read it even more. Still Life with Woodpecker is actually a love story, but it takes place inside a pack of cigarettes. Yes, you read that correctly.\n4. The Guineveres: A Novel by Sarah Domet \nFresh juice and a fresh read #CurrentlyReading #Sunday #HomeSweetHome @sarahdomet @juicero \nA video posted by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Nov 27, 2016 at 9:26am PST \nNeed a book that pairs perfectly with juicing?

I’ll Tell You in Person is a collection of essays that is smart and to the point. It tells tales of failing at love, getting addicted to people, and more.\n6. Pond by Claire-Louise Bennett \nI love October days ❤️ #CurrentlyReading \nA photo posted by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Oct 18, 2016 at 2:04pm PDT \nThe cover alone makes us want to dive into this novel right now. Pond isn’t for the faint of heart. It depicts the ups and downs of living in solitude in a coastal town. It makes you see a world that is dark, funny and somehow moving all at the same time.\n7. Slow Days, Fast Company: The World, the Flesh, and L.A. by Eve Babitz #CurrentlyReading this delicious book #EveBabitz \nA photo posted by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Sep 19, 2016 at 1:56pm PDT \nBreak out your popcorn for this one and prepare to go back in time. Slow Days, Fast Company takes place in Los Angeles during the 1960s. Author Eve Babitz gives you a glimpse into the past, and makes it relevant to today. She gives you a ’60s lens of LA that we’ve almost forgotten.\nWhich of Emma’s book club picks do you want to read first?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:13:10.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
