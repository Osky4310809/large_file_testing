The state of New York will pay you $2,000 if you go green. The reason for the incentive, which covers both zero-emission and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles, is pretty simple. “We want to make electric vehicles a mainstream option,” state Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, a Westchester County Democrat who leads the Assembly energy committee, told the Associated Press . “They are becoming more affordable and we need to encourage them.” \nThe rebate, which launches April 1, may seem laggardly by many environmentalists, who have been biding impatiently for the scheme to take effect since it was approved by Empire State lawmakers in 2016. At least 37 states and the District of Columbia offer some kind of financial reward to make electric vehicles as price-competitive as their gas-guzzling counterparts, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . \nRelated: From now on, all Smart cars in North America will be electric \n“Consumers want to buy these vehicles,” Peter Iwanowicz, executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York , said, adding that April 1 was the deadline for the state to launch the rebates. “It’s just unfortunate the agency decided to slow walk it.” \nBetter late than never, at any rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:52:44.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
