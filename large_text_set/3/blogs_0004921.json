Highs: 63-70.\nTonight: Cloudy, showers. Lows: 46-54.\nTomorrow: AM showers, PM sunshine. Highs: 62-68.\nView the current weather conditions at The Washington Post headquarters.\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\nThe warm weather might be a little enjoyable, but showers and gusty winds prevent this day from bringing the spring feeling we’ve become so accustomed to. We really need the rain to fight off impending drought conditions, so you won’t hear us complain. Sunshine returns tomorrow afternoon with pleasant 60s, but then things cool down later this week with rain and snow showers Friday, then a possible winter storm with much colder weather this weekend.\nToday (Tuesday): Mostly cloudy with showers and warmer highs in the middle to upper 60s. Showers should be scattered in the morning and more common in the afternoon into the evening rush hour. Expect about a tenth to a quarter-inch of rain in most places. Winds pick up from the south at 10 to 15 mph with gusts above 30 mph at times. Confidence : Medium\nTonight: Showers continue overnight with mostly cloudy skies and lows only in the middle 40s to middle 50s. We could pick up another tenth to quarter-inch of rain. Gusty winds continue from the south. Confidence: Medium\nFollow us on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock . Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend.\nTomorrow (Wednesday): Scattered showers continue to hinder our morning commute under mostly cloudy skies, but look for some clearing trends by midday and then a long-awaited sunny, warmer afternoon as highs reach the 60s. Winds shift to blow from the west at 10 to 15 mph with some higher gusts again. Confidence: Medium\nTomorrow night: Mostly clear skies, but still a bit breezy with lows ranging from the upper 30s in the outer suburbs to the middle 40s in the city. Confidence: Medium\nA LOOK AHEAD\nThursday should be mostly sunny in the morning and becoming partly sunny in the afternoon. Look for highs to reach the upper 50s to low 60s, and it’s still a bit breezy. Thursday night finds increasing clouds with lows in the middle 30s to middle 40s. Confidence: Medium\nFriday features another cold front moving through with associated showers that could fall as rain, snow or a wintry mix, under mostly cloudy skies. It’ll be too warm for any accumulation, though, as highs should be in the 40s to around 50 by the afternoon. Confidence: Low-Medium\nThe weekend is a challenging mess right now. We’re pretty certain that temperatures will be cold enough to support snow with highs in the 30s and lows in the 20s. Saturday night into Sunday morning brings a chance of snow in the form of a late-winter storm. (Can we even call it a late-winter storm when we haven’t had winter to begin with?) Forecast models disagree on the storm track. In the District, the forecast ranges from a light coating of snow to significant accumulation through Sunday. We’re going to update on this storm daily through the rest of the week. Confidence: Low\nSNOW POTENTIAL INDEX\nA daily assessment of the potential for at least one inch of snow in the next week, on a zero-to-10 scale.\n2/10 (↑): We’ll have the cold weather, and now we just have to figure out the storm track. It could easily slip too far south and miss our area.", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/capitalweather", "http://www.instagram.com/capitalweather", "https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=KDCWASHI185", "http://www.twitter.com/capitalweather"], "published": "2017-03-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:30:02.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
