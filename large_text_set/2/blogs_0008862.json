Thr win also reasserted lost Anfield identity. \n“Every now and again, it doesn’t hurt to utter some home truths as long as it is not personal, just purely professional,” Lallana explained.

And in producing such a performance – they could have been five up at half-time – they questioned whether Spurs have any at all. \nFor defender Eric Dier, there was an unspoken admission his side still have some way to go before they can seriously challenge the ruthless professionalism of Chelsea at the top of the table.
