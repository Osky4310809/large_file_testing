During a recent interview with Noisey , the 29-year-old singer opened up about her legal battles with her longtime producer, Dr. Luke, and how she's regaining her strength and hitting the road with new music. WATCH: Kesha Opens Up About Body Shaming, Claims She 'Almost Killed' Herself \"When you work really hard at something, then to have it taken away from you is pretty devastating,\" she said, before breaking down in tears. \"I worked my a** off for a lot of years to be able to do it. I sang backup vocals and the first couple songs I was on, I didn’t give a f**k ’cause I just had this one vision. Once you earn that and make that happen, then to have it taken away from you is pretty devastating. It is definitely like a mind-f**k.\" Kesha's legal drama with Dr. Luke (real name Lukasz Gottwald) stems back to October 2014, when the singer accused the producer of drugging and raping her, as well as abusing her over the course of 10 years. In August, Kesha dropped her lawsuit against Dr. Luke in California in an effort to focus on creating new music, according to her legal counsel . However, she is maintaining her lawsuit against Dr. Luke in New York. Dr. Luke has vehemently denied the accusations and countersued for defamation and breach of contract. \"I didn’t rape Kesha and I have never had sex with her,\" he tweeted last year. As for her new music, Kesha says she's going back to her Nashville roots. \"I’ve always loved country music and listened to it a lot growing up, so now I’m like kind of allowing myself to just tap into like my music roots a little more recently,\" she explained. \"Here, it really is the utmost importance to tell the story, and that’s really what songwriting is about — the song is the most important thing.\" Watch the entire interview, below.
