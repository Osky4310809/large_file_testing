They originally signed a four-movie deal with Sandler back in 2014, and that partnership has thus far given us The Ridiculous Six , The Do-Over , and Sandy Wexler (debuting April 14).\nWhile critics didn’t like either released film, and The Ridiculous 6 faced a cast walkout over its racism , Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, touted the film’s successes. “ The Ridiculous Six , by way of example, in the first 30 days on Netflix it’s been the most-watched movie in the history of Netflix,” he said in January 2016. “It’s also enjoyed a spot at #1 in every territory we operate in, and in many of them it’s still #1.”\n“Adam believes his audience is mostly at home and he’s probably right,” Sarandos also said in an e arlier 2015 interview .\nAs Variety observed, Sandler might have been a powerhouse in the ’90s, but his recent theatrical releases haven’t been successful. 2014’S Blended was an out-and-out bomb, and 2015’s Pixels was a disappointment. If Netflix is happy with his numbers, it’s probably the place that makes the most sense for him.\nSandler said in a statement: “Love working with Netflix and collaborating with them. I love how passionate they are about making movies and getting them out there for the whole world to see. They’ve made me feel like family and I can’t thank them enough for their support.”\nUnfortunately, what Sandler could have used from Netflix was a little less support and a little more forced cultural sensitivity. Look, I know that some people enjoy Sandler’s humor, but…it’s just not a good look when someone gets rewarded for making a movie as racist as The Ridiculous Six .\n(Via Variety ; image via Netflix/Happy Madison Productions)\nWant more stories like this?
