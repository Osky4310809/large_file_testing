This adorable piece is by Ellie Horie, and you can see more of her wonderfully cute artwork at her gallery by clicking here ! This Week in Disney History \nThis week in 1987 the Star Tours attraction opens in Tomorrowland at Disneyland. It cost around $32 million dollars to create. \nThis week Disney released both The Air Up There and Cabin Boy in 1994, Snow Dogs in 2002 and Glory Road starring Josh Lucas in 2006. Glory Road was also this author‚Äôs first press junket‚Ä¶ üôÇ Disney Vault \nEach week we highlight an underappreciated Disney classic! This week it‚Äôs the 1964 Hayley Mills vehicle The Moon-Spinners , a romantic adventure flick set on the gorgeous Greek island of Crete. There she gets caught up in a stolen jewel caper with an attractive young lad played by Peter McEnery. The great Eli Wallach ( The Good, the Bad and the Ugly ) plays the heavy with his usual flair, and the scenery alone in the Hitchcock-esque story is to die for. This was also one of the final live-action movies Walt Disney personally produced before his death. Check out one of the more memorable scenes from the film below!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:23:50.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
