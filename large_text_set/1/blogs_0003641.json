They scored a goal at the end of the first half and the second goal in our best moment. \n“When you concede two goals, for sure you have to improve. My team are top of the table because we are working a lot. This league is very tough and it is important to continue to work.” \nAsked to explain Chelsea’s defeat, centre-back Gary Cahill said: “We were short today all over the pitch. I don’t know why. We are not robots.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T13:37:57.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
