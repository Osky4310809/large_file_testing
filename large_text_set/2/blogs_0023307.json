Watch the video above to learn the insane true story of how it happened. \nWhen I saw the doctor, he said he could reattach my bicep. The problem: Doing that would require surgery and I’d be out of commission for awhile. At the time, I had an upcoming UFC fight and I was also training Tier 1 Military units, the highest level Special Forces groups. These are the type of guys who carry out intense raids and don’t exist on paper. \nIf I underwent surgery, I’d miss the fitness seminar they’d scheduled me to teach them. I didn’t want to let those guys down, so I decided to not have the injury fixed. I went on to teach that team of Special Forces operators my elite 6-month fitness program, which I later included in my Men's Health book, Maximus Body . \nBecause I never had the injury fixed, I’ve lost about 10 percent of my biceps strength. Oh well—it hasn’t slowed me down too much, and I don’t regret not letting those soldiers down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:31:49.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
