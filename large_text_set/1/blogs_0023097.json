The cause for the sudden opposition is simple: At this moment, “nearly 200” Google employees are reportedly affected by Trump’s ban. Anyone, including tech workers, traveling with an H-1B Visa (a “skilled” immigration visa) is affected — possibly Green Card holders, too.\nA small handful of tech leaders, like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, are attempting to sway the President’s polices in various directions with reason. But so far there’s no sign that this strategy is working.\nNow is perhaps a good time to ask: At what point do we demand for Trump to reopen our doors? When will Silicon Valley revolt, and hit Trump back where it hurts? If Trump weakens libel laws and starts aggressively jailing journalists and intimidating activists — including as the groups of tech workers who’ve organized against him — will Silicon Valley act?\nWhere is the line?\nHere’s another way to look at it: If Trump bans Twitter employees from returning to the country — and we’ve reached out to Twitter to see if any of its employees are effected by the ban — does Jack Dorsey ban Trump from Twitter? What about Google? Facebook?\nLast week there was silence. Today there are words. Will we see action? Silicon Valley needs to decide what is okay and what isn’t, and draw a hard line.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T00:44:53.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
