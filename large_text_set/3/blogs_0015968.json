Do you then realize that you also use that same bag to haul other things in, such as clean clothes and maybe your lunch? One company certainly has, and developed a gym bag that automatically cleans your gym clothesâ€”no water or laundry detergent required. \nAs you can see from this video published on Engaget , the Paqsule looks like a regular gym bag. It's pretty compact, actually, and wouldn't stand out compared to any other bag you see in the locker room. The inside doesn't look much different, either. There are small pockets, a compartment for your shoes and plenty of room for anything else you'd bring to the gym.
