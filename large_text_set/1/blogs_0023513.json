M.Night Shyamalan is keen to direct \nStranger Things has captured everyone's attention, but none more than M.Night Shyamalan. The famed director said he's keen to direct an episode of the next season. \n\"My boys who do Stranger Things, they did Wayward Pines for me,\" he said speaking to Digital Spy. \"They were round my house and I was like, 'Well you can hire me back, guys!'\" Boys being creators Matt and Ross Duffer. New Characters \nThe rumours are circulating that season 2 will have three new characters. Hollywood Reporter has hinted that their names are Max, Roman and Billy.

Meet the two new Stranger Things cast members (Photo: Netflix) It's a sequel not a new story \nSpeaking about what’s next for the series, Matt Duffer indicated that the follow-up is better described as a “sequel” than a “second season”. \nProducer Shawn Levy said: “The plan is to continue with this set of characters while introducing a few critical key new ones next season,” he told SlashFilm . \n“So I’ll just say that a lot of the big mysteries get answered at the end of Season 1, but we are very much kind of unearthing new problems and questions that merit future stories and future investigation in the most enjoyable way. So we are in love with our cast and our characters. \n“Things end up being resolved to some extent at the end of Season 1, but not entirely. \n\"And that’s why we’re so hopeful we get another few seasons to live with these people a little longer.” Eleven is alive \nIn an interview David Harbour, who plays chief Hopper, revealed the Eggo waffles he leaves in a box at the end of Season One ARE for Eleven. \nHe said: \"He (Hopper) may understand that Eleven exists in some form. And so he’s got this box out in the woods where he gives her food.\" Read More (Photo: Maarten de Boer/Getty Images) Search Stranger Things on Amazon Papa survives \nWhen Matthew Modine's character Dr Martin Brenner gets attacked by the monster the camera cuts away before you see how badly he is injured leaving the door wide open for his return. \nPlus at the premiere he said: \"Oh, there will be a season two.” Read More 11 reasons Stranger Things is the best new show on TV Hopper is up to something \nImmediately after the rescue we watched him willingly get into a car with two suits from the Hawkins National Laboratory.

What does it mean for him? It's like Alien when John Hurt is attacked by the facehugger but later seems fine. There is more to come on Sarah Hopper's cancer \nActor David Harbour has said : \"The Duffers and I talked a lot about that backstory, and even where her cancer came from and Hopper’s guilt around the whole situation. \n\"There is more onion to be peeled back in terms of Hopper’s backstory and what he’s been through. And his daughter’s cancer was a lot more complex than what it seemed.\" (Photo: Netflix) They've already got the format sorted \nSpeaking at the Television Critics Association in Los Angeles , the brothers behind the series, Matt and Ross Duffer, said a second series would follow a similar format of eight/nine instalments running for between 45 and 55 minutes. (Photo: Netflix) Upside Down \nThe second season and maybe a third will focus much more on what goes on in the Upside Down. \nThe creators have a 30-page document that answers all the questions about the Upside Down. \nRoss Duffer said: \"The plan in that second season is to get into more of those questions, like why there was only one monster and what the Upside Down is exactly. \n\"We have all those answers and didn’t feel like they were necessary to answer this season.\" More strong females \nIn an interview Matt Duffer said he wanted the female characters to have \"a strong drive and give them badass moments\". \nAdding: \"That was something that was very important to us and we would do well to keep doing moving forward.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T11:12:20.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
