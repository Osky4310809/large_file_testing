Moto G5 Plus surfaces in live images, features Snapdragon 625 SoC and 4GB RAM By -   Moto G5 Plus is tipped to offer a fingerprint sensor, 32GB of storage and a 3,080mAh battery” \nLast month, some live images of the alleged Moto X 2017 were leaked. Now additional images of a similar looking device have surfaced on OLX Romania. The seller claimed the phone to be the Moto G5 Plus, the successor to the last year’s Moto G4 Plus ( review ). The listing includes the images, complete specs, and price. It’s worth mentioning that the listing has now been taken down. \nAs per the source, the Moto G5 Plus will feature an all-metal design with a fingerprint sensor embedded into its home button. The phone will feature a 5.5-inch full HD display and boot Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. It will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC, mated to a beefy 4GB of RAM. \nThe source further suggests that the Moto G5 Plus will come with 32GB of internal memory, a 3,080mAh battery, a 13-megapixel primary camera with a dual-LED flash, and a 5-megapixel secondary shooter. The phone’s prototype was retailing on the marketplace for RON 1,650, around Rs 26,500. The device is expected to be unveiled at MWC in February.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T10:39:18.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
