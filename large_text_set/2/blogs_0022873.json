A study just published in Archives of Sexual Behavior , however, offers an extremely comprehensive look at the factors that correlate with orgasm frequency. \nLet's start off with the good news: The majority of the over 25,000 women surveyed said they orgasmed every time they were \"sexually intimate\" over the past month. And fortunately for all of us, the researchers delved even deeper in order to break down what might contribute to or take away from our ability to get off. \nHere are five things that women who orgasm more frequently have in common: \n1. They have sex with women \nPeople of any sexual orientation can learn from lesbians—86 percent of whom said they always orgasmed, compared to 66 percent of bi women and 65 percent of straight women. The authors theorize that women who have sex with women place a lower importance on PIV sex (duh), which most women don't orgasm from , and value equality more. Basically, their orgasms aren't deemed optional, and neither are their partners'. \n2. They focus on foreplay \nWomen who engaged in activities like making out, oral sex, and digital sex during their last sexual experience were more likely to report that it led to an orgasm—yet another reason to get over the idea that intercourse is the main event while foreplay is just a warm-up. \n3. They communicate \nBoth women and men benefited from asking for what they wanted, giving their partners positive feedback, saying \"I love you\" during sex, and having fun with dirty talk. They were also more likely to play around with R-rated texts, emails, or phone calls. Foreplay really does start before you even enter the bedroom. \n4. They switch things up \nAdventurous sexual activities like wearing lingerie, trying new positions, experimenting with butt play , and sharing fantasies were associated with higher orgasm rates for women, so don't be afraid to suggest something different. \n5. They're happy with their relationships \nA good sex life and a good love life appear to go hand-in-hand: Women who were more satisfied with their relationships had more orgasms. So the remedy to a lackluster sex life may lie outside the bedroom. \nGo forth and \"have what she's having,\" as the famous When Harry Met Sally line goes. And if all else fails, at least you always have your trusty vibrator .
