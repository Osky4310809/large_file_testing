Singer Katy Perry debuted blonde locks over the weekend and she looks completely different.\nThe “Dark Horse” singer is known for her bold beauty changes and ability to rock any hair color and this new shade of blonde is no different.\nOn Saturday, Perry attended the unveiling of friend and artist, Sham Ibrahim’s new Donald Trump art piece in Palm Springs, California.\nShe had a surprise unveiling of her own, as she sported fiercely blonde short locks. Tara Ziemba/Getty Images The 32-year-old singer also went makeup-free at the event and we love her even more for it. It looks like Perry was touched by a citrus fairy, which we’re totally into. \nTara Ziemba/Getty Images Perry’s hair color is giving us major flashbacks to her ’50s themed birthday party a few months ago.\nSure her yellow updo didn’t last long, but it was bright and bold, which we loved.

Perry even flew in the Pirates of the Caribbean actor’s mom for the weekend, which is adorable.\nPS: there were onesies being worn throughout the night that featured the actor’s face on them that we still can’t get over.\nHi guys.
