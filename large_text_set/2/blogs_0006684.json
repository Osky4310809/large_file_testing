Once sworn-enemies-of-north-western-football, the two Sky Sports pundits now regularly engage in 'banter-tastic' (sorry) exchanges that are often more entertaining than some of the matches they analyse. \nNormally, they troll/mock/laugh at each other when Liverpool or Manchester United suffer a setback - like when Carra rubbed salt into the wound after The Red Devils were beaten by Fenerbahce, or when GNev found a particularly cruel way of wishing his 'pal' a happy birthday. Best buds… sort of (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nHowever, it seems things have now gone up a level. Judging by one of the comments on Neville's latest Instagram post, it appears they have now moved on to outright personal abuse. Here is the post in question - a seemingly innocent picture of GNev getting his hair cut. As with everything Neville posts, there were a lot of comments and responses - most of which were nonsense. But one comment stood out: Yes, that is Neville's colleague - and king of Twitter comedy - making a gag about the size of Neville's nose. Perhaps a tad harsh… but still pretty funny. Further proof, if proof were needed, that we need to see these two men reunited on TV - asap. Make MNF great again!
