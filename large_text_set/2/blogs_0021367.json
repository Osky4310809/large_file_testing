The genius behind Hamilton just walked the Oscars red carpet with his mom , and honestly, we’re not sure our hearts can’t handle it.\nFor starters, how sweet is that? Answer: THE SWEETEST. And also, they look 100% adorable together.\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images Awww. The look on Lin-Manuel’s face says it all, doesn’t it?\nApparently, his mom, Dr. Luz Towns-Miranda, predicted this moment a l ng time ago. Earlier this week, Lin-Manuel told Rachael Ray ,\n“I remember my mom – as a kid – saying, ‘When you get nominated for an Oscar, I’m your date.’ That’s such a pie-in-the-sky thing to say. But she sort of always believed, I think she believed even before I did, so I’m thrilled to get to keep that promise.” Are we the only ones getting a little emotional right now? Surely not.\nMiranda is nominated tonight for Best Original Song for “How Far I’ll Go” from Disney’s Moana . If he wins, he will be the youngest person ever to achieve EGOT status! To become an EGOT, a person must win an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. NBD, right? Only twelve people have ever done so.\nWe’re not going to lie. We’re totally rooting for you, Lin-Manuel!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:46:45.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
