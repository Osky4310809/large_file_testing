But what I can guarantee is that the players we will have available will be the best.” \nThe end result, Daley predicts, will be the team having a lot more points in them — having been criticised for being too defensively-minded during his first three series in charge. \nThe size of the selection battle is highlighted by the fact Daley has five fullbacks — Tedesco, Moylan, Hayne, Tom Trbojevic and Josh Dugan — all knocking on the door. \nDaley has stated he is not afraid to pick his quintet of gun No. 1s out of position with Moylan shaping as a five-eighth option and the other four capable of playing at centre or wing. \nHis halves battle is still up in the air but James Maloney seems a leading contender after playing all three games last year and leading Cronulla to a maiden NRL title.

But that can change pretty quickly.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:17:11.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
