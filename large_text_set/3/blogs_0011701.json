They have asked me to pay more attention to translating suggestions from other delegates on border control and poverty alleviation,\" she said. \nDressed in traditional Uygur clothing and with a fondness for bright-red lipstick, it's hard not to notice Rena when she walks into the room. \nHer duties, similar to those of all translation teams assigned to delegations from areas inhabited by ethnic people, include translating discussions and official documents. \nRena, who joined the delegation's translation team earlier this year, also takes time to study official reports in advance, researching the best way to translate key terms so that she can better communicate national policy. \nThe mother of two has been skipping lunch during the two sessions, so that she has time to translate the documents drafted in the morning before discussions begin again in the afternoon. \n\"I need to be fast and accurate so our delegation can be on the same page as the other deputies and air their views without delay,\" she said. \n\"Even though I will not be on TV like Premier Li's translator, I think my job is equally important.\" \nA graduate of Nankai University in Tianjin who majored in law, Rena hopes to use her legal expertise to promote the rule of law in Xinjiang in the future, by providing legal information to ethnic groups in a language they can understand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T05:01:40.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
