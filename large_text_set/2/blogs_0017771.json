If you want to translate that scenario to our world, here goes: The first official picture from the Young Han Solo movie is here, and it just solved every problem on Earth.\nOkay, mostly all problems on earth. Like, 12 parsecs of them. Principal photograph has just started on the still-untitled Star Wars spinoff-prequel about everyone’s favorite scruffy looking nerf herder. However, Alden Ehrenreich doesn’t look too scruffy right now, so better get working on that.\nHan Solo - Smuggler. Scoundrel. Hero. A new Star Wars Story begins. https://t.co/6mjWKQcwwk pic.twitter.com/dWJwccpY33 \n— Star Wars (@starwars) February 21, 2017 This first picture shows Alden flanked by the rest of the crew, including the two best friends anyone could have, Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian played by Joonas Suotamo (who took over the role from Peter Mayhew for Force Awakens and continues here) and Donald Glover (so hot right now).\nThere are some other familiar faces hanging out with this crew too, like Woody Harrelson, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Emilia Clarke, and directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord. The press release names one more person who isn’t in this picture: Thandie Newton.\nIt’s not a stretch to say this is one of the best casts assembled for any movie ever made. It’s even better that this cast is coming together for HAN SOLO.\n“Watching such inspired people from all over the world, with such unique voices, come together for the sole purpose of making art, is nothing short of miraculous,” Lord and Miller said explained in the press release . “We can’t think of anything funny to say, because we just feel really moved, and really lucky.” Well, hopefully these directors find a few funny things to say over the coming months, and find a few funny situations to put Han Solo in, too. You know how good he is under pressure.\n\nPunch this into your calendars right now: The Young Han Solo movie ovens on May 25th, 2018.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:48:17.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
