Shrestha put the value of roses imported from India at Nepalese Rs 5 million. \nWith increased access to social media and the internet, Nepal’s younger generation is tilting towards Western culture, including events such as Valentine’s Day, and the demand for red roses has increased over the years. \nThe trend of importing roses or other floriculture-related items from India too has increased by 12% to 25% annually, industry observers said. \nAccording to data from the Floriculture Association Nepal, around 7,000 roses are sold on most days. But when it comes to Valentine’s Day, vendors sell around 200,000 roses in a single day. \nLast year, according to the association, the domestic market accounted for 180,000 roses on the occasion of Valentine's Day. People in Kathmandu bought 95% of the total. \nDespite a rise in prices of flowers brought in from India, they are still cheaper than imports from the Netherlands, Italy or the US. \nAccording to Shrestha, one Indian rose costs a minimum of Nepalese Rs 16. Last year, vendors sold each rose for Nepalese Rs 40. \nNepal has just seven floriculture firms that produce roses but their total production capacity is 100,000 roses a year. “The rest of the sticks have to be imported from India,” he said. \nThough there is a good demand for flowers in Nepal, production has not kept pace for several reasons. Nepal now imports more than 70% of its requirement of various flowers and related items from India. Traders said 90% of the total requirements are fulfilled by suppliers based in Kolkata, Pune and Bangalore. tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:03:15.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
