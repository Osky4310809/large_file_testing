Trump’s cabinet kicked off on Tuesday when Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, his nominee for attorney general, went before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Sessions, a Republican, spent all day at the witness table. Here are the observations: It’s all but locked up Barring some bombshell revelation, Senate Democrats do not have the votes to block him, and they showed little interest in trying to drum up Republican support to do so. The support of moderate Republican senators like Susan Collins of Maine and Democrats like Joe Manchin III of West Virginia seems to all but assure his confirmation. Live Video: Jeff Sessions Confirmation Hearing It’s not 1986 anymore The Sessions team had been prepared for questions about racially charged comments Mr. Sessions was accused of making in the 1980s, remarks that helped sink his nomination to the federal bench in 1986. On Tuesday, Republicans mounted a coordinated pre-emptive strike to criticism that Mr. Sessions harbored racist views. But Democrats did not make race a priority, opting not to vilify a colleague who is generally well liked. Instead, they used the hearing to establish the legal boundaries of the Trump administration. And they largely succeeded, as Mr. Sessions said he would reject a ban on Muslim immigration, for instance, and declared waterboarding “absolutely” illegal. Same Sessions, different job Democrats asked pointed questions about whether Mr. Sessions would aggressively enforce laws that he disagreed with and opposed in the Senate. They specifically cited a hate crimes law protecting gay people (Mr. Sessions voted against it) and a law guaranteeing access to abortion clinics (Mr. Sessions opposes abortion). Mr. Sessions said that his job as a senator was different from the job of attorney general, and that he would enforce laws with which he disagrees. “I don’t think it would be hard for me to be impartial and enforce laws that I didn’t vote for,” he said. “I think I can separate my personal votes of maybe years ago from what my responsibility is today.” Fireworks on Wednesday After a full day of testimony from Mr. Sessions, the Senate is expected to hear from those who support and oppose his confirmation on Wednesday. Race is sure to be a focus. Officials from the N.A.A.C.P. and the American Civil Liberties Union — two organizations that Mr. Sessions once called “un-American” — are scheduled to testify. Two African-American lawmakers — Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and a civil-rights leader, and Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey — are also scheduled to testify.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:17:12.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
