Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nAlmost everybody errs at some point during their career by thinking that their job belongs to them and not to their boss. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara pretended to make this mistake last week when he declined to hand in his resignation when, as is his right, President Donald Trump asked for it. Once the White House obliged Bharara’s grandstanding message of I won’t quit, you’ll have to fire me , the torrents of predictable press accolades began cascading down on him like a spring thaw in the Rockies. \nThe set-up was near perfect. Trump’s lies and hamfisted governance have transformed him into the best villain for the media since Richard Nixon recited “the press is the enemy, the press is the enemy” like an incantation in the White House in 1972 . Trump could stoop to tie his shoes on the South Portico and the press would find some way to vilify him. Bharara, on the other hand, is an Obama hire who has charmed the press in his seven years. It’s not even a contest. Story Continued Below \nReporters seeking documentation for his canonization knew where to go to gather praise. The Associated Press printed Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) testimonial on her Twitter feed: Bharara was “a fearless prosecutor who stands up to both parties and Wall Street. I guess that’s why Trump fired him.” Bharara patron Sen. Charles Schumer (D, N.Y.) stopped short of identifying any miracles performed in the line of duty by the sacked prosecutor (a former aide of his), but he did issue a laudatory statement nearly every outlet broadcast for him: “Preet Bharara has been an exemplary U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.” \nThe New York Times enlisted journalism’s most heinous villain—the aforementioned Nixon—to elevate Bharara by comparing his firing to the late former president’s similar dismissal of U.S. Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau. Another Times piece , which did acknowledge that Bharara had been accused by one appeals court of “overreach” and had a way with ginning up publicity for his investigations, tallied his many successful prosecutions of insider traders, corrupt politicians from both parties and terrorists. As the Times recounted, Bharara once said that someone once asked him, “What again is your jurisdiction, exactly?” His answer, “Are you familiar with Earth?” What’s next for Bharara? asked the paper. Perhaps a political career of his own, it answered. \nThe heaving drama behind Bharara’s dismissal was faux, of course. U.S. attorney jobs are political appointments and many presidents before Trump—Nixon, Reagan , Clinton , Bush and Obama —have exercised this privilege, sometimes beheading top prosecutors from their own parties. By demanding to be fired, Bharara made himself a martyr, but a martyr for what? The independence that Bharara imagines is, as the historical record tells us, provisional, so he’s a fool to martyr himself in its honor. Any attempt by him to portray himself as a victim because Trump told him face-to-face in November to stay on deserves our derision. The job, as noted above, belongs to the boss. \nThere’s much fretting that Bharara’s departure will scuttle several active investigations by his office. The Murdoch-controlled and Trump-friendly Fox News Channel may have failed to “properly alert shareholders of settlements with female employees who had accused the channel’s former chief, Roger Ailes, of sexual harassment,” as the Times put it. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) speculates vaguely that Trump’s chess move was about shielding himself from a corruption probe. The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York is unique in that his investigations and potential investigations probably scape up against thousands of rich and connected people, giving his supporters pretext for protesting that he’s being sacked for personal reasons. While this could be true, it still shouldn’t give Bharara or anybody else a permanent sinecure as prosecutor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:31:32.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
