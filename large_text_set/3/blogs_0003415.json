Hines won the Calcutta Cup twice with Scotland, in 2006 and 2008 \n\"We'll prepare the best we can, but going on about 1983 is not going to do us any favours. \n\"I don't think there's a uniqueness to the way Calcutta Cup games are played. Most of the hype is external. \n\"There's no game we don't want to win, but there's no extra motivation for us because it's a game against England.\" \nScotland have been without their sidelined first-choice props - loose-head Alasdair Dickinson and tight-head WP Nel - since November and subsequently lost captain Greig Laidlaw and powerful back-row Josh Strauss to injuries in the second-round defeat by France. \nAli Price impressed at scrum-half in place of Laidlaw in the win over Wales, with experienced back-row John Barclay assuming the captaincy and Finn Russell taking on the place-kicking duties without missing a shot at goal. \nHines, 40, admits heading to Twickenham without their influential skipper is a blow but says other players are emerging as leaders. \n\"Before the autumn internationals, we thought we couldn't do without our front-line props and we had to make changes, we've evolved and become better,\" he said. \n\"It's just another thing we have to adapt to. Greig not being there is a loss, but it gives the opportunity for other leaders to step up. \n\"The group have done really well to adapt to other factors that wouldn't necessarily have been ideal and we're happy with that.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:13:21.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
