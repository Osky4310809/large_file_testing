Artists are encouraged to post their own work. News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. \nIf You Are A Comic Artist Comic artists are welcome to post their own work any way they want. If you don't want to link to your website, put [OC] in your post title (it means \"Original Content\") or request Artist Flair . (Info on flair is below.) \nIf You Are Not An Artist Link to an original source like the artist's website or a syndication site. Link to the page, not the image file, so the artist gets the credit and site traffic. Imgur/rehost links are ok for translations, but you must also state clearly it is a translation and link to the non-English source in a comment. General Conduct Don't complain about the unfunniness of a post or attack artists posting their content Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling. Tag NSFW content when needed. Links to sites that are NSFW should be tagged. Don't put the punchline in the post title Don't change the watermark on a comic you didn't make Avoid URL shortening/hijacking tools (wp.me, bit.ly, su.pr, etc.) Abuse of the [OC] System will result in a ban!
