So, i t is a given that she will be compared to the two ladies who have already made a mark in that industry - Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone. In a recent interview, when asked about this comparison, she said, \"I think they are doing very good work , and I hope I can do as well as them. I don't think I will ever reach their standard. I am okay with the comparisons because I don't think I'll ever be as good as them. They are doing very, very well , and I just hope I can do a fraction of what they are doing. I will be very happy with that.\" On being asked about what kind of projects she is looking for in Hollywood, she added, \"I am looking for the same kind of roles that I am looking forward to when it comes to Bollywood. I want to do good roles even in Hollywood. There's no difference. Wherever I get the best work, I will work there. Even if it's in China. It doesn't matter which industry it is.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:28:01.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
