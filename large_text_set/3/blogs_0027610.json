Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., manages the Trump Organization and has no role in the White House, but he remains an occasional surrogate for his father. The younger Trump also occasionally calls out the President's political opponents on Twitter, the venue he chose Wednesday to weigh in on the incident in Britain. \"You have to be kidding me?!\" Trump Jr. tweeted, as he shared an article from The Independent, and paraphrased its headline as: \"Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan\" You have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan https://t.co/uSm2pwRTjO â€” Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 22, 2017 The article, published in September 2016 , featured Khan's reaction to a bombing in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. In it, Khan said that preparedness for terror attacks is \"part and parcel of living in a big city,\" and asked Londoners to be correspondingly \"vigilant.\" The White House issued a more conciliatory response to the terrorist attack. The President spoke by phone with British prime minister Theresa May, and White House press secretary Sean Spicer said it would be \"irresponsible\" to speculate this soon on what precisely happened or who was responsible.
