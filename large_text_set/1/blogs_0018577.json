He spent nearly 15 minutes speaking about the team, success, the franchise and the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium, set to open later this year. \nBlank mentioned the atmosphere at the Georgia Dome on Saturday when the Falcons beat the Seahawks to move to the NFC Championship Game. From the early tailgaters prior to the game to the electricity during, Blank said: “[I’ve never] seen the energy I saw the other day.” \nHe’s also never seen his Falcons team as quite this exceptional. \n“I feel more confident about the team than I have in any of my 15 years,” said Blank when speaking about what makes the 2016 Falcons special. \nHe also answered questions about the dance moves he displayed after the win over Seattle. \n“There’s a picture right over there of my mother, as an example,” said Blank. “My mother was a great dancer; she loved dancing. I probably, my love for music — all kinds, classical to folk to whatever — came really from her. \n“I have three daughters that are all great dancers. My three sons I would say, all three are good dancers. Two of them are particularly good dancers, and one, my middle son, has fine-tuned his dancing his dancing at our guest ranch in Montana over the last 15 years we’ve owned that. Trying to keep up with him on the dance floor in the summer time isn’t easy, but I try.” \nYou can listen to the entire interview with Falcons team owner Arthur Blank by clicking below: \nOn the Falcons’ youth: “I love the fact — on both sides of the ball, offense and defense — the talent that we have today is young. I mean you look at people that are changing the game today, if you will, for Atlanta, it’s the entire roster for sure. But the names that come to mind are players that have been here for fairly short periods of time. I look ahead and say this team has a chance to be a competitive team for a very long period of time.” \nOn Mercedes-Benz Stadium: “We’ll be opening up, officially, for our first soccer match there July 30.” \nOn what winning a Super Bowl would mean: “It would mean a great deal for me personally and a great deal for my family. Probably more important than those things, I know what it would mean to our players and coaches and our fans throughout the city, the community, for Atlanta, which has a rich history and has been great to me, personally and professionally. For all of those reasons it would be a time for great celebration. We would celebrate for as long as we were allowed to, which would have a stop period and then we would re-focus on next year.” \nKnox Bardeen Knox Bardeen - Weekends / Falcons Reporter Knox Bardeen is a show host at 92-9 The Game and content creator for 929TheGame.com.
