Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIsaac Chamberlain is tough; this much became evident after the British cruiserweight overcame more than seven rounds with a dislocated shoulder to defeat Wadi Camacho for the Southern Area title. \nThe 23-year-old is drawing inspiration from overcoming adversity whilst also continuing to hone his ring style on the likes of WBO World cruiserweight champion Oleksandr Usyk and pound-for-pound great Andre Ward ahead of his return to the ring. \nAfter almost six months out, Chamberlain has completed his rehabilitation and is looking to steal the show on Matchroom Boxing's latest venture: NXT GEN - which begins on Friday at York Hall in London. \nChamberlain, unlike the majority of fighters in the 200 lbs division, prefers to box and use his skills, but showed an ability to brawl and fight on the inside as a result of his injury vs Camacho, which he insists is a positive. \n\"I would say it's a positive,\" Chamberlain told Mirror Sport. \"It's better that people mostly know who I am. A lot of boxers are acting the same. Chamberlain feels his injury vs Camacho is a positive (Photo: James Everett Photography 2017) Instagram \n\"Now I stand out. The people that stand out will take interest in me more. It was a positive. I'm a strategic type of person. I had to mix it up with him. It's all about the mental phase.\" \nChamberlain, a bright and affable young fighter, revelled in the attention at his media workout at Miguel's Boxing Gym in Brixton, London. Despite his youth, he has clearly been a student of pugilism for a long time, which has clearly rubbed off on his ability in the ring. Chamberlain is looking to diversify himself from other cruiserweights (Photo: James Everett Photography 2017) \n\"Guys like James Toney, Mike McCallum - Andre Ward is a big one I watch as well,\" Chamberlain explain. \"What they can do in certain positions. They can execute all types of punches. \n\"Their balance is key. It's really exciting. I'm trying to bring something completely different.\" \nFellow cruiserweight and WBC World champion Tony Bellew recently moved up to heavyweight for his shock victory over David Haye, but it is not the Bomber in his division who Chamberlain looks to learn most from.

He's a very good boxer,\" Chamberlain says with a smile on his face. \"The way he moves; the lateral movement and angles - you don't see that often in my weight class. \n\"A lot of the cruiserweights are relying on power, punching and brawn. I'm using my brain and Usyk obviously uses his brain [too]. I'm trying to elevate that into my style a lot more, really outsmarting these guys.\" \nWhile there is evidently great respect for Bellew and his meteoric rise in the last year, Chamberlain simply replies 'yes' when asked whether Usyk is a superior fighter.

He didn't let off on me. He tried to really bring it. \n\"The fact I stuck there and I mixed it showed the level I can be at before my debut. I was really excited. \n\"[The spar with Anthony Joshua] was very technical. I really enjoyed it,\" he admits. \"I loved it. It really made me think, 'I can be at this level' if I dedicate myself as much as they are, I can really be there. It was really motivating for me. It boosted my self esteem.\" \nChamberlain hopes to be British champion within a year and gently move towards the world scene, but now the focus is purely on shining at York Hall to prove a dislocated shoulder was a small price to pay in becoming a better fighter. \nWatch Isaac Chamberlain on NXT GEN this Friday live on Sky Sports Facebook and Sky Sports 1 (from 22:00). poll loading Will Isaac Chamberlain become British cruiserweight champion? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T08:23:18.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
