It definitely looks kind of like a gas mask — but for your pleasure rather than protection. There are three slots for scent cartridges, and there are 30 scents to pick from. The cartridges are heated to release their aromas when the mask is turned on, and the OhRoma app pairs with the mask via Bluetooth, so you can control which smells are released when and at what intensity.\nImage: Camsoda\nAccording to CamSoda, which makes the device, the result for users is “an immersive experience unlike anything before, bringing them closer to the action.\"\nThe most intimate of the scent offerings are “private parts,” “panties” and \"body odor.\" Depending on your tastes these could either enhance your experience immensely or make it the VR equivalent of shoving your face in a dirty laundry basket. Which still might enhance your experience.\nSEE ALSO: What's next after VR porn? Hologram porn, apparently.\nIf those aren't your cup of tea, perhaps you’d prefer the “breath” scent, which is probably the closest you’ll get to simulating an interaction with a real human. There are also other more vague categories like “aphrodisiacs” or “environments” category (think: chocolate or a flowery field).\nOnly time will tell if the $70 device (scent cartridges are $10 each) becomes a must-have item for VR porn aficionados. In the meantime, you’ll have to decide whether the OhRomas passes the smell test.\nBONUS: Tech reporter tries VR porn, may never be the same again", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/SmDnxTeS.jpg", "https://www.camsoda.com/labs/ohroma/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/o0D3ZJN2Ej-rJNEjXPcZspGB0L8=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351728%2F4a1ce35f-fa60-45e3-a7e2-c941278fc5be.jpg", "https://www.camsoda.com/products/ohroma/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Bhu_hVKbvcE7wSZ-kYTrsFJVCFk=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351728%2F4a1ce35f-fa60-45e3-a7e2-c941278fc5be.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/SmDnxTeS.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T17:15:32.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
