Sunday to protest President Donald Trump's executive orders fast-tracking the construction of the formerly-blocked Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. \nThe Dakota Access pipeline has been the subject of protests at Standing Rock that have lasted for months: activists say the pipeline's construction will desecrate land sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and that a leak would disrupt the water supply for 17 million people who drink from the Missouri River (which the pipeline would cross).
