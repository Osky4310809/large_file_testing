New schools cost £3,000 [US$3,660] a square meter so we need to make sure we are getting absolute bang for our buck.” \nAlthough the council claims parents and pupils have been consulted on the plans, the announcement of gender-neutral bathrooms has sparked protests among some parents concerned that they could infringe on pupils’ privacy. \nMalcolm Balfour, SNP councilor for Drumchapel and Anniesland, said parents had contacted him with “serious concerns.” \nWhile acknowledging that unisex toilets support LGBT pupils, Balfour claimed that they might be problematic in some cases as they undermine privacy. \n“I can see that it teaches kids it doesn't matter what their gender is. \n“A girl who feels trapped in a boy's body and a boy who feels trapped in a girl's body might feel embarrassed to be going into the 'wrong' toilets,” Balfour admitted, as reported on the Independent. \n“But girls mature more quickly than boys and they start to develop towards the end of primary school and they need their privacy.” Read more Rise in transgender children puts British primary schools under pressure \nMcEwan defended the plans, however, saying that the toilets would be fully enclosed and bathrooms would only share a row of sinks. \nA fully accessible facility will also be built away from the unisex ones in case any issues arise or if someone feels uncomfortable using unisex bathrooms. \nIn November a school in Leytonstone, east London, announced that it would introduce unisex toilets for pupils over the age of eight. \nBuxton School’s head teacher Kath Wheeler welcomed the initiative despite a petition against it being signed by 700 people. \nAccording to the East London and West Essex Guardian, Wheeler said the full-height toilets, which were fully in line with the Department of Education and Waltham Forest Council regulations, would encourage respect among pupils. \nParents though were concerned the new initiative would instead lead to premature sexualization and sexual abuse. \nOn petition site Change.org, one parent described unisex toilets as “totally disgusting” and said: “There's already so much child abuse going on and this will increase the situation even more. \n“If anything does happen then the headteacher and other associates will be fully responsible. Totally disgusting.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:05:00.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
