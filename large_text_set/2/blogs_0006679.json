Even better, if you have insurance, you may be able to save an extra $100 off when you bring this co-pay / co-insurance Savings Card to the pharmacy.\n\nIf you qualify, you can apply this Savings Card up to three times, with a maximum of $100 per two-pack or $300 off the out of pocket cost.\nIf your pharmacist is unable to provide the savings at the time you fill your prescription, follow the instructions on this form to submit for a mail-in rebate. If you are eligible, you will receive a check in the mail within 14 business days. Be sure to save your original pharmacy receipt (cash register receipt will NOT be valid) since it is required to be mailed with the rebate form.\nDo you have other tips related to prescription drug savings?
