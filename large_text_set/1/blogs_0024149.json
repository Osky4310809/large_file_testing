In tonight’s New Rules, Bill Maher hit liberals for being overly outraged about every little thing that may seem to be somewhat politically incorrect to them and allowing those issued to issues to take up their attention while Republicans took over the government.\nHighlighting a number of incidents involving celebrities apologizing for being too insensitive, Maher sarcastically asked, “Where do you think you are — some kind of melting pot?”\nThe comedian offered up a laundry list of sensible and fairly popular positions that Democrats endorse while still losing elections, stating that there could be a myriad of reasons for the dilemma, but the one that can be quickly addressed.\n“The one we can immediately fix is that too often Democrats remind people of a man who has taken his balls out and placed them in his wife’s purse,” he explained. Maher also challenged the audience to be offended at the remark, telling them to tweet at him so he could tell them to “go f*ck yourself.”\nSwinging back to celebrities having to apologize for something that in the grand scheme of things is trivial, Maher invoked the election of Donald Trump .\n“What matters is that while you self-involved fools were busy policing the language at the Kids Choice Awards, a madman talked his way into the White House,” he exclaimed.\nMaher ended the segment with this: “While liberals were in a contest to see who could be the first to call out fat-shaming, the Tea Party was taking over school boards. Stop protecting your virgin ears and start noticing you’re getting f*cked in the ass!”\nOf course, smacking liberals on the nose for being too PC has been a running theme of Maher’s. Following Trump’s election, Maher stated that one good thing coming from it could be the riddance of PC culture. He’s also called PC college protesters “little monsters,” begged the PC police to stop ruining Halloween , and smacked Democrats for betting caught up in PC bullsh*t.\nWatch the clip above, via HBO.\n[image via screengrab]\n–\nFollow Justin Baragona on Twitter: @justinbaragona\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/#!/justinbaragona", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fmaher-slams-liberals-for-being-so-pc-they-dont-notice-theyre-losing-and-getting-fcked-in-the-ass%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bill-maher-pcedited-1.jpg&description=Maher%20Slams%20Liberals%20For%20Being%20So%20PC%20They%20Don%26%238217%3Bt%20Notice%20They%26%238217%3Bre%20Losing%20and%20%26%238216%3BGetting%20F%2Acked%20in%20the%20Ass%26%238217%3B", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fmaher-slams-liberals-for-being-so-pc-they-dont-notice-theyre-losing-and-getting-fcked-in-the-ass%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light"], "published": "2017-01-28T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T09:13:31.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
