So I think the game was a great publicity for the Premier League all around the world.\" \nThe match saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic head an equaliser six minutes from time, cancelling out a first-half James Milner penalty that was awarded for handball against Paul Pogba. \nMourinho conceded the decision was probably accurate, but could not resist another dig at some of the officiating his side have received this season. \nHe added: \"I didn't watch but the referee was very close so it probably is a penalty. \n\"The problem is the criteria. Sometimes you give them. Sometimes you don't. It's amazing that in 21 Premier League matches, three in the League Cup and one in the FA Cup - 25 matches - we had one penalty. \n\"Even Michael Oliver told me at the end of the game, 'This time it was a penalty!' It looks like it was a penalty. \n\"We can do, and have done, much better this season in terms of the quality of our game, but I think Liverpool can do better than what they did too. \n\"As a proper derby it had everything. It's good to see that Liverpool also can play defensively and on the counter-attack they were always dangerous.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T01:21:28.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
