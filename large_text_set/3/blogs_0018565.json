As well as women like me, who favor total abortion rights,” she said. \nIn her Friday interview, Paglia also took aim at entertainers who fancy themselves political commentators. \n“They had every right to say what they wanted,” she said of the women who spoke at January’s Women’s March. “It just is these actresses and these performers — and I am a teacher at an art school and feel very close to the arts — they seem to think that the only way they can have any importance in the world is by showing they’re deep thinkers about politics. And in fact it is embarrassing.” \nPaglia also highlighted her particular disappointment with Madonna’s recent attempt at political relevance. \n“Madonna is one of the most important figures in the history of modern women, actually — with the work she did in the 1980s and 1990s, in making pro-sex feminism possible — but she is in a terrible decline,” Paglia said. “And she should mind her own business and focus on her own creative life, because as a political commentator, it’s an embarrassment.” \nListen:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:48:34.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
