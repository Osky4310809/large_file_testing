Furthermore, Brieger ruled that \"an effective investigation requires broad access to sources of information,\" much of which the corporation has already offered to New York investigators involved in a similar probe. \nHealey's investigation stems from revelations in 2015 that indicated Exxon has long understood ‒ through internal research ‒ the climate impact of fossil fuel extraction, and has gone to great lengths to cover up this knowledge while misleading its shareholders and the public. Hey. Big win for @MassAGO Maura Healey, as court says Exxon must produce documents for her probe. This is a big deal on a tough day — Bill McKibben (@billmckibben) January 11, 2017 \n\"In today's order directing Exxon to comply with our investigation, the court affirmed the longstanding authority of the Attorney General to investigate fraud,\" said Healey spokeswoman Chloe Gotsis, according to the Springfield Republican. \"Exxon must now end its obstructive tactics and come clean about whether it misled Massachusetts consumers and investors about what it knew about climate change, its causes and effects.\" \nExxon has challenged Healy's orders in both Massachusetts and Texas; the latter case is still pending. Exxon is \"reviewing the decision to determine next steps,\" said company spokesman Alan Jeffers, according to Reuters.

During the hearing, Tillerson said \"the risk of climate change does exist.\" \n\"The consequences could be serious enough that action should be taken,\" he said, adding that the \"ability to predict that effect is very limited.\" \nTillerson skirted questions about Exxon's knowledge of climate change and its financing of 'climate change deniers.' \n\"I am no longer able to speak on the company’s behalf,\" Tillerson said.
