Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and House Freedom Caucus member Jim Jordan recently announced plans to introduce separate healthcare legislation . \nThe White House official conceded that some conservative concerns about the bill won’t be addressed, noting “the nature of legislative negotiation.” \nAmidst backlash from conservatives over the bill, two White House staffers, counselor Kellyanne Conway and conservative liaison Paul Teller, attended coalition meetings with conservative groups on Wednesday, a source with direct knowledge of the meetings told The Daily Caller. \nTeller and Vice President Pence staffer Sarah Makin attended the Weyrich Lunch , a weekly off-the-record conservative strategy meeting, while Conway attended Americans for Tax Reform’s weekly center-right coalition meeting. \nThe White House official denied that Teller and Conway’s attendance at the meetings was meant to be any sort of “damage control” related to the healthcare bill, saying that the staffers had previously planned on attending the meetings. \nTrump has personally been trying to woo skeptical conservatives — both in and out of office — into supporting the bill. \nTrump and a handful of White House staffers — including Conway, chief of staff Reince Preibus and chief strategist Steve Bannon — met Wednesday night with leaders of conservative groups about the healthcare bill. . @POTUS @realDonaldTrump meeting with conservative leaders in the Oval Office this evening- discussing #Obamacare . #RepealAndReplace pic.twitter.com/5Ojcnw9eiW \n— Dan Scavino Jr. (@Scavino45) March 8, 2017 \nThe meeting was attended by leaders of the Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action for America, Americans for Prosperity, Tea Party Patriots, Club for Growth and FreedomWorks. \nThe president issued a tweet Thursday around noon, stating, “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!” \nTrump then hosted a bowling outing at the White House on Thursday with GOP lawmakers as part of his efforts to garner support for the bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:19:09.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
