Assistant Chief Constable Rebekah Sutcliffe was found to have breached the standards of professional behaviour Credit: Manchester Evening News Telegraph Reporters  27pm \nA police chief has escaped the sack from her £109,000-a-year job after she bared her breast in a drunken tirade at a junior colleague. \nAssistant Chief Constable Rebekah Sutcliffe, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP), told Superintendent Sarah Jackson that her \"credibility was zero\" after she had a \"boob job\" and berated her as a \"laughing stock\" who would be judged professionally \"on the size of her t---\". \nThe 47-year-old then went on to pull down the front of her dress to expose her left breast and say: \"Look at these, look at these, these are the breasts of someone who has had three children. \n\"They are ugly but I don't feel the need to pump myself full of silicone to get self-esteem.\" \nFollowing a misconduct hearing late last year, a disciplinary panel ruled that she had breached standards of professional behaviour. \nBut GMP Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling ruled on Monday that she could keep her job. \nAnnouncing his decision at the force's HQ to follow the panel's recommendation, he said: \"Despite being absolutely appalled at her behaviour and all too aware of the damage to public confidence I do not think I can take a different view without any significant reason to do so.\" Assistant Chief Constable Rebekah Sutcliffe arriving at Manchester Police Headquarters on Monday Credit: Andrew McCaren/LNP \nT he panel had stated her gross misconduct had taken her to \"the very precipice of dismissal\", but accepted it was out of character and recommended a final written warning would suffice. \nMs Sutcliffe, who was the most senior female GMP officer at the time, verbally attacked her younger colleague following a gala dinner at the national Senior Women in Policing Conference last May. \nThe haranguing in the early hours of May 6 at Manchester's Hilton Hotel concluded when Ms Sutcliffe told her colleague she was no longer going to support a further promotion for her. \nMs Jackson, who was appointed by Ms Sutcliffe as a temporary superintendent in a secondment role, later said she was \"shocked, mortified, embarrassed and ashamed\" at the comments made by her superior. \nShe added that she had suffered \"great anxiety from the night itself and since\". Superintendent Sarah Jackson Credit: Greater Manchester Police \nM s Sutcliffe's counsel, John Beggs QC, had handed the panel more than 200 pages of testimonials with many officers speaking of Ms Sutcliffe as \"inspirational\", \"visionary\" and \"a strong leader\". \nOne unnamed female detective chief inspector at GMP said she is \"a role model to many women in the organisation\". \nMr Beggs said she remained a role model, with \"human frailties\", who would \"emerge as an even impressive senior leader\" if allowed to. Assistant Chief Constable Rebekah Sutcliffe was at the time the most senior female Greater Manchester Police officer Credit: Manchester Evening News \nM s Sutcliffe admitted misconduct in failing to treat Ms Jackson with respect or courtesy and that she abused her position and authority. \nShe also acknowledged that her actions discredited the police service. However, she had denied it amounted to gross misconduct.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T15:31:53.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
