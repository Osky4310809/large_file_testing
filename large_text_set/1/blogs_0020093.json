For us, Netflix is one of those safe havens where we feel we can lose ourselves in a favorite movie or new TV show and forget about the outside world. \nNow that January is almost over, there are a whole slew of new films and shows making their debut on the streaming service. We are pleasantly surprised at what Netflix has to offer us for February, especially those of us who will most likely be spending our Valentine’s Day binge-watching. So, grab your favorite wine, buy some guilty pleasure junk food and check out some of our favorites from next month’s list. 1. Babe (1995) \nWhat better film to put a smile on your face than the classic tale of Babe ? The adventures of this handsome little pig and his farm friends are the simplistic escape you so desperately need right now. Plus, a little nostalgia is always a solid mood booster. Just in case you weren’t feeling old yet, Babe turns 22 this year. \n2. Balto (1995) \nBalto is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite childhood movies and I could unashamedly watch it on repeat for hours. This heroic tale is based on the true story of a courageous pup who saves Nome, Alaska from a deadly epidemic and it’s nothing short of inspirational. \n3. Disney’s Finding Dory (2016) \nYou might be pretty shocked to see this Disney film already making its debut on Netflix after only hitting theaters earlier this year. However, now we can watch the adorable Dory forget things as many times as we want without interruptions, so I think it’s a win-win. \n4. Invincible (2006) \nNext up, we have the story of a lifelong football fan Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg) whose life-long dream comes true when he’s offered the chance to play with the Philadelphia Eagles. 30-year-old makes football history by becoming the oldest rookie in NFL history who never played in college. \n5. Magic Mike (2012) \nWhoever decided to bless us with unlimited viewing of a stripped down Channing Tatum deserves a serious promotion. We could not be more excited to plan a wine night with our best girls to drool over this chiseled masterpiece. Yes, the thirst is very real. \n6. The Blair Witch Project (1999) \nIf you’ve never seen The Blair Witch Project and for some reason happen to be in the mood to get scared shitless, now is your chance. This late 90s classic follows the story of three film students who vanish after attempting to make a documentary on the local Blair Witch legend in Maryland. Only their footage was found left behind and it will keep you from sleeping for weeks. \n7. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe (2005) \nBased on the first novel in a best-selling series by C.S. Lewis, this film adaptation follows the story of four English siblings during WWII who are sent to live in a country house to escape the London bombings. The youngest sibling, Lucy stumbles upon a wardrobe in her new home that transports her to a magical world. She shares her discovery with her brothers and sister and their adventures in Narnia begin. \n8. The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) \nI’m going to assume that the majority of you have seen this work of art by the infamously disturbed Tim Burton, but if you have not February is the time. This stop-motion animated musical fantasy encapsulates all that is Tim Burton’s creatively dark mind. The king of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington, discovers an entirely new town, Christmas Town and decides to bring the two worlds together. \n9. Twilight (2008) \nGo ahead and roll your eyes, but you know that you’re going to end up watching this horribly made film adaptation of Stephanie Meyer’s teen vampire romance. Yes, it’s a pretty terrible movie, but even the most critical eyes can’t deny drooling over Robert Pattinson just a little bit. \n10. Superbad (2007) \nThe gang of hilarious horny misfits including Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and the infamous Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are back for your non-stop viewing pleasure. If you’ve never seen Superbad , we recommend doing so while extremely intoxicated or under some other form of influence. \n11. Milk (2008) \nThis film is based on the true story of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be voted into public office in America. Sean Penn stars as this revolutionary character who not only paved the way for advancement gay rights, but also “forged various coalitions across the political spectrum.” \n12. Sausage Party (2016) \nIf you feel like melting your brain with absolute stupidity for a few hours, please watch Sausage Party. I guarantee you will not use a single brain cell while doing so, but you will get a pretty good laugh out of it which is always nice. Especially if you enjoy the vocal talents of Seth Rogen and indulging in certain herbal materials. \n13. Night Will Fall (2014) \nHelena Bonham Carter narrates this heart-wrenching historical documentary featuring uncovered footage from World War II. Researchers discovered that the footage was actually a documentary was shot by Alfred Hitchcock and Sidney Bernstein back in 1945 about concentration camps in Germany. \n14. Be Here Now (2015) \nThis touching documentary follows the experiences of Spartacus star Andy Whitfield and his family as he battles non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Whitfield’s inspirational story gives an unfiltered insight into the trials of illness and how he makes the choice to fight his disease and not suffer from it. \n15. American Crime Story: People Vs. OJ Simpson (2016) \nThis limited series takes viewers into the depths of one of the most infamous court cases of the 20th century, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, as told from the perspective of his lawyers. The 10-episode show gives behind-the-scene look into the deliberations of both prosecution and defense and their attempts to sway the jury. 16. David Brent: Life on the Road (2016) \nThe film catches up with BBC’s The Office star David Brent 12 years down the road and finds that he is now a traveling salesman. He has not, however, given up on his dream of rock stardom and is about to embark on a “self-financed UK tour with his band, Foregone Conclusion.” And here’s the full list of additions: Feb. 1: Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies, and Cyber Attacks Babe Babe: Pig in the City Balto Balto 3: Wings of Change ContactCorpse Bride", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T18:21:18.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
