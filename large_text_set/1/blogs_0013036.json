Now a couple of weeks ahead of the event, the company’s new flagship, allegedly dubbed the Nokia 8, has been leaked. Apparently, Qualcomm showcased the Nokia 8 flagship at CES. The chip maker asked people to not to take photos of the device, but someone managed to shoot a video of the phone. \nThe source suggests that the Nokia 8 will come in two variants – one with a Snapdragon 835 processor and 6GB of RAM, and the other with a Snapdragon 821 SoC and 4GB of RAM. The Snapdragon 835 SoC-powered edition of the phone will feature a massive 24-megapixel rear camera with OIS and EIS, a 12MP selfie shooter, and dual front-firing speakers. There’s no word on the camera specs of the Snapdragon 821 edition of the phone. \nThe leak shows both variants of the Nokia 8 side by side with their camera app open. The 24MP sensor of the Snapdragon 835-powered variant of the phone with OIS and EIS displays a high level of stabilisation even while shaking. The device is expected to feature Carl Zeiss optics, and its prototype appears to have a small rectangle with HRM written over it, which suggests a heart rate monitor. We will have official details next month, so stay tuned.
