Too much of content ... Instead of creating content, a lot of websites should be focused on cleaning content. This requires a full scale content audit crosswalked with SEO metrics like organic entries, on site engagement and inbound links data. From there, you should be able to determine if you should delete, update or 301 each page on your site.\nI outline this process (plus a free automation template) in this post \nAside from that, I just wish our industry stopped reading blogs and started taking more action. There's many theorists and not enough practitioners, it's rotting this industry from the inside out. Ryan Stewart Webris.org Many people still think that having a high volume of crawlable and indexable pages is *always* better. It's not necessarily if: Most of the crawlable pages are non-indexable, canonicalized, redirected, error pages then they will just be wasting the crawl budget of the site, likely making more difficult to find the indexable ones meant to be ranked. The indexable pages are of thin and/or duplicate content, that will end-up cannibalizing with each other, ranking poorly, providing a bad user experience and likely being caught at some point by Panda or Phantom. Aleyda Solís Aleydasolis.com Myth: You need to create content on a regular basis to rank batter.\nI hear this myth quite often. Yes, while a website that has more pages does tend to get more traffic, it is not necessary to rank well. My website (digitalux.co) was ranking for the keyword \"digital marketing company\" when it had only 30-40 pages on it. Other websites ranking for that exact same keyword had hundreds or thousands of pages. The quality of the content and the quality/relevancy of the backlinks going to that content is much more important than the amount of content on the site. More content equals better rankings and more links ... We fell into this trap early in this year and quickly decided to switch our focus to making one or two big content assets. We created one infographic and a slide deck on a study we did using our lead validation system. Then instead of using our time writing new blog articles we used it to show off our work/pitch it to other websites and have received 100+ referring domains linking to our content.\nStill months after creating these two pieces they are still bringing in 10-20 links a month per asset. Our rankings and leads have greatly increased because of it. Tim Ohlrich Straightnorth.com I think one of the great SEO myths is every site should have a blog. I have seen sites invest in filling passionless blogs with content to feed the SEO machine. But if an organization can't commit to building out compelling content that visitors actually care about, its marketing team should consider building out evergreen content, such as guides.\nFor example, I had a client once who did tourism marketing in a really popular city in the U.S. They read about the importance of a blog and had interns writing posts, but not one of them ever had any traction. They each got a handful of social shares (mostly from employees), and they didn't engender much organic search as well. But their competitors were eating their lunch with evergreen guides on things like \"X Free Date Night Ideas in [Popular City]\", \"X Great Things to Do with Young Children in [Popular City]\", etc. \nSo if a site can't invest in a blog, I highly recommend starting off with building out resources their target audience would care about, want to share on social media, and want to link to. Annie Cushing Annielytics.com One of the main counter-intuitive truths about SEO is that more articles will result in more traffic. Often times, people take the \"if you write it, they will come\" approach and this simply isn't true. Instead, you should focus on creating content that is very comprehensive and then share that content through outreach. This additional outreach will get people to view the content, but will also get you backlinks which is the main factor in website ranking. Ron Stefanski Onehourprofessor.com I think for me a myth I’d like to expose is that all you need to perform organically is to produce good content. You hear a lot of hot air about content, why it’s important, why brands need to be producing it etc, but not a lot of context about measuring impact. We see many brands pumping out huge quantities of content daily, but not many seem to be asking why they are doing this or attempting any kind of measurement at all. Often, simple technical fixes or adjustments to websites can have a huge impact to organic traffic, much more than simply publishing another 10 blog posts that no-one is reading or sharing.\nThis is why I want to fly the flag for internal linking specifically, to underline its importance and power. For me internal linking is one of the most undervalued aspects of SEO, with many sites having inefficient menus and/or poor site structures. If the industry took a little less interest in the ‘content’ myth and more in the actual mechanics and workings of their own websites, it would probably be in a much stronger place! Patrick Langridge Screamingfrog.co.uk Many beginner bloggers and webmasters think that they need to churn out lots of content on a regular basis. But the truth is that quality will always trump quantity. Rather than writing content for content’s sake, focus on improving your existing pages and creating new articles that go in-depth to answer questions that no one else is answering.\nI rarely write new blog posts, but through use of the Content Upcycle Method I’ve focused on improving the content that is already performing the best. This tactic generated more than $4,700 from a single blog post in a single month and I’m on track to beat that record this year. Mallory Whitfield Missmalaprop.com In a modern SEO world where the word ‘content’ is banded about on a daily basis by SEOs, there has been a move to create as much content as possible in a bid to win the ‘content war’. In reality more content can end up actually harming your site, bloating it out with non-targeted pages and wasting valuable crawl budget so Google spends less time on the pages that provide your audience with the most value.\nThe best way to get around this is to refocus your content creation activities to focus more on producing much higher quality content with even more value to your audience. If you are currently producing five articles a week that get less than 100 visits each, try creating a single keyword-targeted article each week, with more research and more value to your audience, and then actively promote this article to key influencers in your industry. You’ll find this reaps much better rewards for your efforts than the five articles a week. The concept of quality over quantity is still as prevalent as ever today. Freddie Chatt Amara.com The number one counter-intuitive truth about SEO is that getting rid of dead weight on your website will help you boost traffic. There have been countless of case studies about the effects of content audits but people still don’t seem to be catching on to it. We’ve seen amazing results across many sites from deleting hundreds of low quality articles, empty pages from years back that never attracted any links, social signals or even readers!\nIf you don’t have any of the latter on an article, there can literally be zero harm to your site and it’s better for you to delete them and redirect to a more relevant source. Often times you’ll find that consolidating some of these old articles can easily lead to a killer piece of “skyscraper content” that takes off. Karl Kangur IMLivin.com “Build on the trust of existing content”\nFrom an SEO perspective, I never treat a piece of content as ‘complete’. There is always room for improvement with updates, additional information, and various other things that can make it more useful to visitors. At the same time, once the content has been published it is important to monitor the keywords that Google ranks it for. Often this can help direct your efforts at improving the content and capturing better rankings for better keywords. \n“It is far better to invest time and effort into fewer high ranking pages than it is to constantly churn out once-off articles.” \nA good example comes from one of our forum answers about which are the best website builders for SEO. Initially this started off as a quick recap of an earlier article we had written about website builders. But, after watching the organic search traffic coming from Google we decided to update it… several times. Now it boasts tables of data ranking website builders across a range of SEO related metrics, it talks about on-page features, content creation, links to additional SEO resources, how to get started creating a websites, what great tools there are to test their site’s SEO, example of fantastic SEO design, and more. \nAs the page has grown, so has the rankings it captures in Google – faster than fresh content would. # 3. About Google 99% of people don't need any fancy tools or tactics. They just need to write the best content online for the topic they want to go after. There's no need to get backlinks, carefully structure the article, etc. Google is smarter than that now. Just focus on writing the best answer to whatever search query you're going after, and if you did that, you'll gain the rank in time.\nThat's all I've ever done, and I get ~10,000 visitors a day from Google. Nat Eliason Nateliason.com RankBrain can interpret a user search to find pages that might not even contain the search keyword. It’s judging a site and article based on quality, depth of answer, overall reputation of the site, etc. Honestly, at this point we really don’t even know all the possible ranking factors involved but the depth of analysis that RankBrain brings is going to be staggering.\nJust like the early days of the microprocessor, the intelligence of AI is growing exponentially every few months. In a couple years who knows what’s possible. So as far as today is concerned, how do you get ready? \nThe answer lies in putting writing quality above all else. Don’t try and stuff keywords where they don’t belong. Yes, still focus on keywords, but your north star for everything you write should be the user. AI will actually make the Internet a better place - spammy sites will start to disappear as they become more irrelevant. \n“Content factories” will become less profitable. If you want to understand where Google is headed, get yourself a Google Home. Start playing with it and see how AI is changing everything. Rick Ramos Healthjoy.com It may seem counter-intuitive, but Google is tightening its organic results for 3rdparty websites and trying to respond to the good amount of searches by itself. I mean you try searching for the election date, it will not encourage you to go to 3rdparty websites. Instead, it will answer you the date right on the Google screen only.\nThere is no point of creating a calculator to attract your potential visitor because Google has an amazing calculator right in the search results. You type in math, and it will answer you in microseconds. \nRand Fishkin said in his presentation at Mozcon 2016 that 40% of all searches result in no clicks (Google answering them). \nI know it is scary and sounds untrue, but this is what the truth is ... Moosa Hemani Setalks.com \nWe had to shorten Moosa's great advice a bit. But you can find its full version here. A counter-intuitive belief that many SEOs hold is that \"PageRank\" is dead. In fact, PageRank has changed, but it is far from dead.\nIn the old days (say pre-2009) PageRank was a MAJOR ranking signal, and SEOs did everything they could to game it. Later, several developments occurred that led marketers to pay far less attention to PageRank. Google's algorithm became much more complex. As a result, PageRank became a less significant ranking factor. As a result, it became harder to influence search results through PageRank alone. In 2009, Google dealt a blow to \"PageRank sculpting\" by changing how PageRank was distributed through nofollow links. Finally, in 2016 Google killed the PageRank score shown in toolbars and browsers. This was fine, as they hadn't updated this public-facing score in years. \nThe real PageRank–the score actually used to rank webpages–was still being calculated behind the scenes. Unfortunately, by this time nobody cared anymore. Everyone had learned by now that \"PageRank\" is dead. \nIt became–and still is–a social taboo for SEOs to even mention PageRank in polite circles. \nIt's true that the influence of straight PageRank isn't what it used to be and it's much harder to game. In fact, Google reps have more than once mentioned many types of low-quality or off-topic links that don't pass any PageRank at all. \nOn the other hand, PageRank variations can be used by many parts of Google's algorithm, including Topic PageRank and Entity Salience, to name a couple. If a link is good, relevant, and editorially earned, it likely passes PageRank, and possibly more than one type of PageRank. \nUnderstanding and recognizing how PageRank flows can make a difference in your SEO campaigns. The difference in many cases will be small, but in a competitive environment, every advantage counts. \nBeyond PageRank, another mistake I see folks make is assuming that links pass value equally. A link is a link is a link, right? (no, no, and no). We've known for 10 years that this isn't the case, yet folks forget all the time or act as if it doesn't matter. Cyrus Shepard Cyrusshepard.com Your keyword rankings do not exist in real life. In other words, no actual human sees your website as it appears in an incognito mode, non-localized, non-device setting with no previous search history SERP. It's purely a construct of SEOs.\nA rankings report is a diagnostic indicator. It is not a key performance indicator. That said - a rankings report is still incredibly useful. You should use rankings data from Ahrefs, Search Console, and manual SERP checks to try an idea of what might be happening in the SERPs and to inform what you should do next. Nate Shivar Shivarweb.com Most webmasters believe Google crawls their website in one go and will continue until everything's crawled. After all, that intuitively seems the best approach. However, it's far from the truth. Google's crawling of any website is a fragmented affair, spread out over many visits in a given time period, with some URLs crawled very often and others rarely at all. Understanding how Google's crawlers interact with your website is a fundamental principle of technical SEO. # 4. The role of SEO I think the #1 counter-intuitive truth about SEO is that not everyone needs it, or at least that not everyone will benefit from it in the same way. Yes it is important for SOME businesses, maybe even a lot of businesses, but there are some business that based on their niche, competition, and search volume are better off spending their marketing time and money elsewhere, instead of blindly following the SEO hype Dave Schneider Ninjaoutreach.com The truth about SEO is that for 99% of businesses, it’s not a great marketing tactic. The problem isn’t that it couldn’t generate results. But other methods are much more consistently effective for almost all companies. Sure, SEO is ‘free,’ and it’s good to handle the basics of it, which is usually enough to generate moderate results, too. But investing a lot of time into it is generally a mistake—although, for 1 in a 1,000,000 it pays off nicely, and they’re the case studies you find everywhere. Peter Sandeen Petersandeen.com The #1 lingering SEO myth we see at the moment is that SEO exists in some kind of magical silo where all other marketing activities can be ignored. Really, this is not the right way to think about things and whilst social signals may not directly influence SEO being active on social media can help build relationships that in turn can lead to opportunities that do influence your SEO. This is of true of social as it is of PPC and content marketing and all these activities should work together with SEO at the forefront to create an SEO smart digital marketing plan. Ultimately do great marketing and figure out how to integrate that with your SEO efforts and it's win win.\nAnother common myth we come across is that Google is now so clever that the foundation elements and good technical SEO simply don't matter any longer. That's just not the case and only this week we worked with a UK company who saw their homepage disappear due to issues with HTTP / HTTPS and misconfigured canonical URLs. We also recently worked with a charity (pro bono of course) who lost 90% of their traffic after a seriously botched website redesign. As the web gets more complex and sites get bigger and older technical SEO is more important than ever - Google is not always as smart as should be! Marcus Miller Bowlerhat.co.uk It’s counterintuitive to think that SEO should drive your brand and content strategies because it shouldn’t. Instead, you should focus on building out your brand and content strategies around unique, differentiating core values that help you stand out.\nFrom there, you will be able to then identify the type of keywords and search terms that reflect those values. If you only focused on SEO and used that as the foundation for your content strategy, it would lack the engaging level of advice and information necessary to attract your audience after they found you through a search term online. \nIt’s not just about getting them to your website; it’s about keeping them there. John Rampton Johnrampton.com SEO no longer exists as a standalone strategy to gain more visibility in search.\nIt can only be successful when viewed as a part of a bigger, more holistic approach to marketing where content, social media, networking, community building - overall online visibility, in other words - are completely interconnected and interdependent. \nFocusing on SEO alone, without integrating the whole kit and kaboodle, will yield mediocre results at best. Ana Hoffman Trafficgenerationcafe.com One of the biggest SEO myths I hear on a regular basis is that you can \"SEO your way\" to top rankings and organic traffic growth with simple onsite optimizations alone.\nSure, tweaking title tags, optimizing existing copy across key pages, addressing technical issues, etc are all important fundamental SEO tasks, and executing on them can deliver some short-term results. But those inputs alone aren't going to consistently grow organic traffic long term. \nThe only way to see sustained, exponential, organic traffic growth in competitive niches is with content marketing. SEO IS content marketing now, and content is the single biggest engine for month-over-month organic traffic growth. So if your SEO strategy doesn't involve publishing a portfolio of strategic, value-driven content assets on a regular basis, then you're not doing SEO properly and you're not going to see optimum growth. Ken Lyons Cornerstonecontent.com Let's say the meta keywords tag was some huge ranking boost if you did it just right. Well if you knew that trick & did it then you could use it to make $x or have outcome y, but if you specifically shared the tip to a bunch of SEOs then many would emulate it & then the relevancy algorithms would adjust or Google engineers might step in to whack some people who were leveraging the approach.\nIn an online information market controlled by a monopoly (with many friendly water carriers) there is little incentive to share specific information about a precise example of where consensus thinking is wrong, because it may only be the lack of belief in something which allows it to remain true. \nI am not really active in SEO like I was for many years, but there were (and surely still are) many areas where consensus perspective is wrong, but it can cost a lot of time and money to find some of them, and then if someone unequivocally proved their case, they might immediately make it untrue. \nThere was a (rather long!) period of time where the SEO industry operated like a meritocracy. It no longer does. Which is perhaps part of the reason some of the brilliant & passionate bloggers from years gone by (like John Andrews) don't blog much anymore. \nI also think it is a mistake to promote any particular secret as a go to idea at this point. Sometimes I see people blog something like \"idea X is so effective & what I am doing for my clients right now\" and then a year later that same person will blog \"idea X is getting abused and is now spam.\" \nIt sort of makes you wonder if they believe what they wrote at both points in time. If they did, then it makes you wonder if they care about the longterm health of their clients. If they do, then hopefully (for the sake of their clients) whatever they are selling clients today won't be something they choose to write up as being an overt form of spam a year from now. # 5. Technical SEO I think it’s true that Google has gotten better at crawling the most amateurly created sites, or even the newest AJAX and dynamic frameworks, but that doesn’t mean technical SEO is dead.\nIt’s my belief that since Google has improved its crawlability, it makes having an optimized hierarchy and clickstream even more important – because Google can see a flawed site with better focus. \nIn the last couple years, I’ve seen a resurgence of technical SEO needs. We’ve done great things with just technical work, and have seen traffic and revenue improvements correlating positively with the technical work. This includes optimizing for bots and load, managing index bloat, speed, and so on. Bill Sebald Greenlaneseo.com ... Stop jumping into the link building bandwagon if your website isn’t really optimized to bring in the best results. By simply being prepared, you cut the waiting time and get rankings/results much, much earlier versus just link building alone. Dennis Seymour Leapfroggr.com We spend so much time focused on what's new in search or what the future will hold, it's good to remember sometimes that the past is equally as important. That applies to links acquired in the past that could become a problem. As well as previous iterations of a site that may have resulted in stacked redirects, lost equity, 404 errors, outdated site maps and architectural considerations that should be evaluated regularly.\nWhile it's important to stay current and be proactive based on where search is going, we can't neglect history. Jennifer Van Iderstyne Overit.com According to me, the #1 counter-intuitive truth that other webmasters should know about SEO is: Technical SEO – More specifically, website load time and content delivery.\nI have seen many webmaster don’t consider this fact while developing & hosting the website. No matter how big / small is your website is; but by considering this fact, you can not only gain better organic SE ranks but also can decrease the bounce rate. Google has clearly mentioned these points in official webmaster guidelines. Jignesh Gohel Olbuz.com Using Meta Keywords\nI'm involved in dozens of redesigns and new site launches for some of the biggest brands every year so I have a distinct pleasure of working with many webmasters and developers from top agencies. By far, the number one counter-intuitive truth about SEO they should know is that meta keywords element on the webpage doesn't matter at all for SEO rankings. \nGoogle, and other search engines, totally ignore it so my advice is to leave it blank. It wouldn't hurt to add a few targeted keywords, but why would you make this information public for your competitors to see and reverse engineer on their sites? Overoptimizing meta keywords tag can look outright spammy to the spiders, so I'd just retire this tag altogether and cross it out from any tech SEO checklist. “We have rel=canonical tags, so we don’t need to redirect duplicate page derivatives.”\nFalse. \nA canonical tag is merely a Band-Aid, as it mainly only addresses Google (versus other search engines), and doesn’t address bookmarks, social shares, link destinations and so on like a redirect would help. Jordan Kasteler Jordankasteler.com Until you know how to properly use them, adding tags and categories to your WordPress posts can do a lot more harm to your SEO than good.\nFirst, each new category and tag creates a new archive, which is indexed by default. If you create several new tags for each post, like many newer bloggers do, you'll pollute Google's search index with dozens of thin and low value URLS. After all, each one will only contain one post or post excerpt, which means they don't provide any new value that you can't find in the original blog post. Once Google encounters too many URLs like this, your crawl rate will suffer, which will damage your entire site's ranking in a variety of ways. \nIf you do manage to use every tag and category on at least a few different posts, you can still run into keyword cannibalization. If you have two tags or categories that are close matches, like \"fashion design\" and \"clothing designs\", both archives could compete for the same traffic and neither will effectively rank. It's even easier to have one category and one tag that compete for the same keywords, or one archive and one static page. \nFinally, if you don't add any supplementary content to your archives (like descriptions and links to your relevant cornerstone content), then you're wasting them. The PageRank from your blog posts' links will still flow through your archives to your newest blog posts, which is good, but the archives are less likely to be used by real users, which also means they're less likely to ever earn organic links. By not linking out to relevant cornerstone content, you're making your archives less useful for real readers, denying views to your best content, and missing out on passing some strong PageRank and relevancy signals. # 6. Off-Page SEO The counter-intuitive truth is that as much as you will want to, the more time you spend reviewing analytics & Search console & then checking off all the million little check boxes of \"perfect onsite SEO\" the longer it will take for you to do what REALLY moves the needle: building links.\nI am by no means advocating an abdication of solid on-page SEO, and preventing \"shoot yourself in the foot\" errors like leaving a disallow in your Robots.txt but putting a \"how to we promote this\" mentality into your core planning and creation process. While there may be a lot more traffic for one keyword phrase vs another keyword phrase, you are never going to harvest that traffic unless you also put mind into how you're going to get links and awareness of that page/resource out there. Jeremy Rivera Jeremyriveraseo.com The less you chase SEO, the more it seems to be effective.\nFor example, NicheHacks and its writers has never been big on SEO, PBN's and whatever else people spend their time and money on. \nInstead, we outreach and tackle down sites that are already big and popular in our space. By doing this, we get more shares, links and attention from big named bloggers. \nWe focus on creating epic content, content that is bigger and better than what's already out there. By doing this, we get more traffic from Google than any other source. \nForget SEO, focus on epic content and reaching out to big named bloggers and you'll eventually get lots of attention from Google. Stuart Walker Nichehacks.com Webmasters must aggressively promote each piece of content they publish with pre- and post- outreach.\nIt's counter-intuitive because a common assumption is that if you write a 2,000 to 3,000-word blog post, you will somehow get a spike in organic search traffic. Not true. \nPageRank isn't dead. \nYour \"epic\" article, video or infographic must be promoted far and wide if you wish to rank for even low competition long-tail keywords in 2017. \n#1 - Run your competitors' article URLs through Ahrefs' Site Explorer Backlinks or Batch Analysis feature. #2 - Export your backlink results to a CSV file. #3 - Get the first name and email address for the webmaster or blogger of each unique domain name in your backlink results. #4 - Email the site owner about your new article before you publish it.
