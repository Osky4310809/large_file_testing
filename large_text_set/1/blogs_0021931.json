That’s probably why, during an appearance yesterday on The Ellen DeGeneres Show , Aaron Paul hinted that Jesse Pinkman may return in an episode or two of the show’s hit spin-off , Better Call Saul . Seriously, this is the best news we’ve heard all day.\nOf course, he didn’t totally confirm that it’d be true, but hey — he alluded to it. We’ll take it.\nIt all started when DeGeneres asked the question that’s been on everyone’s mind since the Saul Goodman-based prequel hit started airing on AMC back in 2015 — “Will you be on Better Call Saul ?”\n“God I hope so,” Paul said. “Maybe I already shot the…or, they just wrapped the last season…I could be.” Watch the full clip below. Paul spreads the rumor starting around the 1:45 mark. Worst case scenario? Paul just aired out some wishful thinking. But his character was so magnificent that it’d be somewhat tough for creator Vince Gilligan not to fit him into the plot somehow.\nWhile Paul has starred in so many projects since Breaking Bad wrapped in 2013, he still holds the show dear to his heart.\nWho's watching the Breaking Bad marathon right now?!? Thank you AMC for bringing back so many memories. ⚰️ ⚗️\n— Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) December 27, 2016 And he’s still not tired of Jesse Pinkman’s catchphrases, as he often entertains his fans with a “bitch” or two out of love.\nYo Bitch! To everyone that has ever asked me to call them a bitch, here you go. It's an App Bitch! Happy Holidays. https://t.co/CjS1rcSROe \n— Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) December 5, 2014 As of August of last year, Paul was in chats to develop a drama for NBC called Blackmail . And of course, he’s also still voicing the character of Todd on the Netflix show Bojack Horseman .\nStill, it’s nice to know that he’d make time for Jesse Pinkman. And, that’s one of the reasons why we think Aaron Paul is so fantastic — he’s the type of guy to never turn his back on the character that made him a household name.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:02:36.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
