The golgappas, filled with a slushy paste of potatoes and tangy tamarind water, are gulped down in one go. Tourists from abroad too can be seen relishing the spicy snack.\nGolgappas have different names in different parts of the country. In Bilaspur, a not-so small town in Chhattisgarh, I came across a seller – I only remember his surname, Yadav ji – who had painted all its synonyms on his handcart.\nTake a look.
