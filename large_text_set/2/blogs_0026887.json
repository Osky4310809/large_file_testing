It is the World Cup. They should be able to attend the event, whatever their nationality is. But let’s hope it does not happen.” \nCeferin has also spoken out against his concern regarding Brexit, and the possibility that star players are not allowed into the UK for the Champions League final, which is due to take place in Cardiff on June 3.
