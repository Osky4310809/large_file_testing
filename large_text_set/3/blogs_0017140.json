The experience had a huge impact on Kim, who retreated from social media and public appearances for months after the incident. Now, she's opening up about the experience on her E! reality show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians. In tonight's episode of the long-running series, Kim will finally tell her side of the story, and if you're wondering why she waited to tell the story on KUWTK , she posted an Instagram explaining exactly why.   A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Mar 19, 2017 at 11:44am PDT Most Popular \"I thought it was important to share this story through my eyes & not in an interview where my own words could be twisted,\" she wrote in the caption of the last family photo she took on her Paris trip. \"I have always shared so much & I'm not going to hold back when this was probably one of the most life changing experiences for me. I would never wish this experience upon anyone, but have learned some valuable lessons & feel so blessed to be safe home with my babies & husband.\" This is Kim's story to tell and, if she wants to share it at all, it should absolutely be on her own terms.
