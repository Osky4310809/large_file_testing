I will work (as a minister) till 3 p.m. and then take a flight to Mumbai. I will shoot (for the show) till 3 a.m. and be back early morning,” Sidhu told the media after assuming office. \nSidhu was widely speculated to become the Deputy Chief Minister but got the number three slot in Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s Cabinet. \nWatch this also: \n“Captain is like my father.
