By Eric Barton 21 March 2017 \nIvar Kroghrud spent six years as an officer in the Norwegian navy during the 1990s and every August he found himself among strangers. \nMilitary service is compulsory in Norway , and each year Kroghrud would get an entirely new batch of recruits. By working long hours together on relatively small patrol boats, the crew would get to know each other quickly, learning each other’s traits and quirks and the best ways to work together. Later, he went into the business world and he found that it was completely the opposite. \nIn 2000, Kroghrud, who lives in Oslo, founded online survey and data company QuestBack, and was struck by how hard it was to get to know his colleagues. Within the next decade, the company had grown to more than 300 employees – so many that he never learned some of their names, let alone their personalities. \n“I was both intrigued and frustrated by the amount of time it takes to really get to know someone in business,” Kroghrud says. “If people are left to discover who they are by working together, there’s bound to be problems and conflicts.” \nHe drafted a one-page document on the best ways for others to work with him \nIn 2011, while attending a conference at London Business School, a professor mentioned in passing an idea that Kroghrud thought might solve his problem: a personal user manual. Back at his office, he drafted a one-page document on the best ways for others to work with him. It noted his likes and dislikes and what he expected of his staff. For instance, he’s prone to deliberations, even when others wish he would just make a decision. \nThe feedback was immediately encouraging, with fellow employees saying it offered them insights into working together more effectively. Ever since, he has encouraged everyone he knows to write a personal user manual of their own. \nTo some, the idea of a personal user manual might sound like an efficient way to get along with people in the workplace. But, for others, it may seem to be a practice in half-truths and corporate-speak. Yet companies that use personal user manuals say they’re a tool to help coworkers to get along in an era where many work from home and can’t get to know each other at the watercooler – or prefer not to connect on social media. \nStill, if you’re thinking of writing a user manual of your own, there a few things you need to know. \nKnowing me, knowing you \nThe idea for a personal user manual came about when Larry Stybel was waiting for for a scheduled meeting. This was in 2003, and Stybel, an executive recruiter and co-founder of the Boston firm Stybel, Peabody & Associates, used the downtime to read the instructions for his new cell phone. \nIt occurred to him that it would be useful to have an instruction book for every executive he recruited. So he experimented with the idea by writing a user manual for himself. Then, convinced it would help people get to know each other, he asked every executive he placed in a new job to write one of their own. \nThe manuals helped to reveal an executive’s idiosycrasies \nOver time, Stybel found the manuals helped to reveal an executive’s idiosycrasies. And also how subordinates could best work with – or circumvent -- them. There’s the college professor, for instance, who encouraged colleagues to make an office appointment rather than approach him as he walks the halls, a time when he likes to think. Or the CEO, who admitted he knew he often told the same war stories, so his user manual encouraged subordinates to cut him off when he started recounting old tales. \n“It has greatly reduced the uncertainty of a new hire,” says Stybel. “More than that, it has helped increase their chance of success in the new position.” \nCatching on \nRecently, the use of personal user manuals is one that’s been discussed at conferences for executives, and some tech companies and startups have asked their employees to write them. \nDavid Politis, founder and CEO of IT platform BetterCloud, learned of the idea last year at a conference. During one session, the speaker asked attendees to write personal user manuals right then and there. \n“For me the ‘a-ha’ moment was looking around that room” he says. “Everyone’s heads were down, furiously writing away. I realised that this was an idea I could take back to the office.” \nTwo weeks later he held a meeting and asked his employees to write a user manual of their own. He suggested they use a set of standard questions, including, “What’s the best way to communicate with you?” and “How do you like to get feedback?” The answers were published on shared folders for anyone in the company to read. Politis published his own on social media, and even sent a copy to his in-laws. \nThe user manuals uncovered explanations to issues that had simmered in the office \nThe user manuals uncovered explanations to issues that had simmered in the office. For instance, the company’s CFO revealed in his user manual that he liked to work early mornings before taking the train to work. One of his colleagues, meanwhile, wrote that he likes to work late nights, and suddenly they both understood why there was often a delay between emails and responses they sent to each other. \nFor Politis, his revealed that when he’s quiet during meetings, his employees shouldn’t be concerned, but instead know that he is just taking it all in. \n“You hear people referencing their user manuals all the time now,” Politis says. “You walk into a meeting and someone will say, ‘I scheduled this for 7am because I saw in your user manual that you like to meet early.’” \nToo much information \nThe personal user manual concept isn’t without its downsides. Stybel, its creator, cautions that it should never be mandatory, because it could be perceived as invasive. That’s especially true in countries like Japan, where personal habits are less likely to be discussed in the workplace. \nIf the CEO goes first and is honest, people below will be honest \nThere’s also a propensity for people to be less-than-truthful in their responses, including the cliché of claiming your biggest negative is working too hard. Politis cautions that the way to avoid those pitfalls: “If the CEO goes first and is honest, people below will be honest,” he says. \nBen Dattner, an organisational psychologist and executive coach, based in New York City, says the idea is a helpful tool for remote workers who may never have a chance to meet their colleagues face-to-face. \nBut, he warns, there’s the danger that your boss’ user manual could be inaccurate. Maybe your manager’s user manual claims he likes to be challenged, something you learn isn’t true when he chastises you for doing just that. \nIn a way, it’s a vulnerability, so you have to use some caution \nThere’s also the worry your user manual could be used against you, especially if you tend to divulge too much about yourself, he adds. Reveal that you don’t like early meetings, and your “morning person” boss might say it’s time to adapt.

He doesn’t require it as his current company, MagicGarden, which helps startups develop their businesses. But Kroghrud still maintains the user manual that he first penned, occasionally updating it. \n“It’s all these quirks that make people people,” Kroghrud says. “The user manual is just a shortcut to finding them and understanding what makes your coworkers tick.” \nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter .
