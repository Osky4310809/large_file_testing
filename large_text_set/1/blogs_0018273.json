Traits possessed by Champions. \nManchester City need to inherit one of Arsenal’s best attributes and shake off another that is usually the preserve of Arsene Wenger's side, to become serious challengers again. \nHow long now have their been question marks over the Gunners mental strength? 13 years? Well maybe that is about to change. \nIn the chaos of the final few moments of yesterday’s game at the Emirates, they came good. Led by the imperious, sometimes naughty and ultimately daring Alexis Sanchez, they instantly responded to disappointment and mercilessly nicked the 3 points. \nThe worries over their inability to see out games, win when the chips are down, and triumph in adversity aren't over yet - nothing has been won - but they are regularly showing they can snatch the points when they appear to be slipping away. City dropped two points against Spurs...

No chance. \nThe instant response against Burnley is not an isolated incident. Only two and a half weeks ago they came back from 3 down at Bournemouth, four days later they robbed a place in the fourth round of the FA Cup from plucky Preston in the final minute. They have also equalised late at Old Trafford and broke the hearts of West Brom and Ludogorets. No team has scored more goals in the last ten minutes than Arsenal this season. \nThey have a collective mental strength driven by the passion and the energy of Sanchez who along with Diego Costa, another ruthless soul, leads the race for the Premier Leagues golden boot. \nManchester City played wonderfully during their draw with Spurs. It was truly a privilege to be at the match. Silva slaloming, Sterling snaking, the speed and precision of the attacking battalion was at times breathtaking. City were sublime at times against Spurs but the game changed when Raheem Sterling was denied a penalty (Photo: AFP/Getty) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T12:48:29.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
