He loves his wife but he loves his parents and his siblings too,” a source told the Daily Mail . \n“He’s also close to Haroon because both of them are boxers so to miss his wedding celebration has caused him some angst. But they both understand that he’s in the middle of a training camp and he can’t interrupt that to attend the celebration.” \nIt’s just the latest dramatic development for the boxer. Khan has been embroiled in a very public argument between his wife and his family for months.
