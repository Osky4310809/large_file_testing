I told her it would be brief, but the events of the last three days have changed things. Instead, I want to be expansive and clear. I want to talk to you about fear: fear of communities perceived as threats, fear of those who would isolate and expunge those communities, fear of being helpless and caught up in this great wave of turmoil. I also want to talk about apathy in the face of fear, the impulse to blind ourselves to stormy waters ahead by looking too closely at our immediate tranquility. It’s very easy to think of Brentwood and Franklin and Nashville and Hendersonville and Nolensville and Belle Meade as stages apart from the great debates and battles that will define this period in world history. It’s very easy to believe that geography and a life already filled with commitments to family, friends, work, etc. have left you far away from the centers of action with little time or energy to effect change. It’s very easy to resign yourself to conversations about all the things going wrong, without any agency to act on what’s right. I want to convince you that this couldn’t be less true, that your potential to make a difference is immeasurable. But first, some facts. In an executive order signed Friday January, 29, 2017, President Trump temporarily suspended immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and permanently suspended immigration, including refugees, from Syria, whose people are caught in a bloody war between a genocidal government and terrorist groups. The order was written broadly to include permanent residents, green card holders, those with work visas, dual-citizens of Britain and Canada and other countries, and many more. The order makes exceptions to religious minorities from these Muslim-majority countries, effectively making it a ban on Muslim immigration from those countries. As I write this, students and teachers from Ohio State and Clemson University are not being allowed out of airports because they are Muslim and Iranian. Muslim Iraqis who worked for years as translators for the U.S. military, at great risk to their own lives and their families’ lives, for the promise of a visa to the U.S. are being told to go back to Iraq and face their certain deaths . Legal, Muslim, Somali and Sudanese residents who work at Google and Uber and Microsoft, now abroad visiting ailing family members, would be refused flights back to the U.S . And of course, Syrian refugees, (78% of whom are women and children) who’ve spent years grinding through background checks, interviews, and certifications all while living six or eight to a tent in squalid refugee camps, are now being told, yes, you had a chance at safety and opportunity, but no longer . These aren’t abstract cases either. These specific people and many more are well-documented in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune and numerous local, reputable, newspapers and magazines. My parents, like many of you, have walked a treacherous path to prosperity. They started life in impoverished circumstances, worked against impossible odds, and somehow made it here, for me and my brother to have the opportunities we enjoy today. When I hear these stories, I can’t help but hear the echoes of my own family, and yours. I read that yesterday an Iranian mom, who took her new-born daughter to Iran to visit family, was unable to reunite with her husband here in America . When I read that, I can’t help but think of the last time I went to India to see my ailing grandmother (my father’s mother) before she passed away, and how my brother held her frail, crumbling hands as she spoke lovingly of him with words he didn’t comprehend but in a universal language he understood. I looked over at my dad, and it was the happiest he’d been in years, watching those two. If we weren’t American citizens then, but instead Yemenite legal residents today, our family would not have a chance to make that memory. There is a fear taking hold of America, a corrosive fear. It is a fear with many progenitors, nurtured and groomed by many hateful sects, and now released against many communities. The targets are, traditionally, the least among us: the vulnerable, the maligned, the oppressed, with the fewest resources to defend themselves, and the fewest allies to call upon for help. They are sick, poor, gay and lesbian and queer and trans, they are black and brown, disabled, female, Muslim, and they are foreign. They are people you may not understand or agree with, but your lot is inextricably tied with theirs. Those now in power seek to channel that fear. They want to strip away the dignity of humanhood from these people — maybe slowly, maybe imperceptibly, but definitively. They will lie to you and confuse you and obfuscate their intentions. They will manipulate your fears to achieve their ends. When that fails, these powerful people will count on not only a fear of those other groups, but also our fear of challenging the powerful, to accomplish this evil. They will count on you feeling powerless to stop their campaign. They will try and turn that feeling into apathy, an acceptance of the inevitable. They will say they outnumber you, have vast resources and command the will of the people, so why take a chance? Why try? They will make you believe you don’t have a stake in the fate of these others, so why fight for them? I don’t need to convince you that what they’re doing is wrong, but I do want to convince you to actively resist it. You have a stake in all that’s happening, and the best answer to why you should fight is your own history. How hard did you have to work to come here? How much did you have to sacrifice to be here? How painful was it to leave your families, your culture, the comfort of home to come here, for the promise of a better future? How much did you struggle to get that first driver’s license or secure that first mortgage with no one to help you but fellow Indian transplants? How many dinners did others cook for you when you first moved here? How many friends invited you to their homes so you wouldn’t be alone? How long did you cry when you had your first kid, knowing they’d have choices you couldn’t dream of? How proud were you when they first started school, and how angry were you when you found out they’d been bullied at school? How scared were you to send them off to college? How loud did you shout at the TV when you were watching news about India’s corrupt political system or violent acts against Muslims or Hindus? How wide did you smile when you first got that satellite connection so you could watch Indian serials? How much did it mean to you to be able to back to India and see your family, after all that time? How angry were you when you first tasted racism or hate in this country? How helpless did you feel when no one stood up for you? You need to remember the answer to these questions when the urge to do nothing is greater than the urge to act. You need to remember that other families, from other parts of the world or living lives very different from your own, have answers to similar questions, and you need to remember that their answers are the same as yours. You and they are one and the same. So what can you do? A lot. Everything. More than you can imagine. You are more powerful back in Tennessee than I am in Washington, DC. I’m in the most liberal city in America, with few minds that need changing. You are surrounded by opportunities for change. You have elected representatives at the local, state, and national levels who have not listened to you. You have neighbors and co-workers who have taken you for granted. You have a community of like-minded, rich, talented, kind people who have built a strong, trusted network. So far, that network has only serviced itself and local Indians and Indian-Americans, but there is now a need to refocus its power outwards and change the community in which it exists. Start small. Call your representatives and advocate for causes you believe in. Fight for 20 million people to keep their insurance through Obamacare, or the tens of thousands of refugees fleeing certain death in Syria, or against his idiotic wall we’re expected to now pay for through our taxes. The next time you host a party, ask people to donate to a worthwhile cause like the American Civil Liberties Union or the National Resource Defense Council instead of bringing a gift. Take ten minutes each morning to read the news and learn about the issues. Find out if the people who claim to represent you really do. Organize yourselves, vote, make sure your friends vote. Talk to your kids about all these things, make sure they understand their responsibilities in all this. Teach them to stand up for others who can’t stand up for themselves. Take them to a protest or a rally, show them how powerful their voice can be. Take these small steps and build towards something greater. Make yourself a force to reckon with. Other Indian communities across the country have done what I’m asking you to do. They’ve activated their own powerful networks and forced power to change hands from those who would demean to, those who inspire. They put people into office like Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi from Illinois, whose family needed food stamps and public housing when they first moved from New Delhi but would go on to send him to Princeton, Harvard Law, and now Washington, DC. They helped other like Kamal Harris from California, whose parents came from Chennai and Jamaica, go from Berkley, California to the United States Senate Chamber. They changed the landscape by elevating Ami Bera and Ro Khanna and Pramila Jayapal to the House. And locally, they’re putting the best among them in state senate seats, local school boards, and city councils. They’re campaigning for human rights for all people, fighting to stop climate change, advocating for better schools, trying to find solutions to the opioid epidemic and so much more. You can do the same thing. You can forge yourself into a powerful tool to advance the core ideals of the Indian community through activism. If you believe in opportunity for those who work hard and do the right thing, take action. If you believe in helping those struggling to find their footing in a strange, sometimes hostile, country, take action. If you believe in a better future for your kids, and my kids, and your neighbors’ kids, take action. I’ll be here to help you all along the way.
