ADVERTISEMENT \nThe order issued by Judge Ruben Reynaldo Roxas recommended no bail for the accused. \nAllen is also facing a complaint before the anti-fraud and computer crimes division of the NBI NCR office. \nAllen denied violating any law. \n“I have not committed any crime in my life. I would not have come here if I did. The worst that I committed was a traffic violation. This is crazy,” he told the Philippine Daily Inquirer at the NBI office. \nHe refused to speak further as he was still waiting for his lawyer.
