(The ridge is technically known as an accretionary equatorial bulge.)\nNearing its end, Cassini delights again. Here is 35-km Pan in mind-blowing detail with its unmistakable accretionary equatorial bulge. pic.twitter.com/RdgqnH4rkJ \n— Carolyn Porco (@carolynporco) March 9, 2017 \nA study published in 2007 suggests that the ridge formed from particles from Saturn's rings that have fallen onto the surface of Pan and gathered around its equator. Another Saturnian moon, Atlas , also has a similar ridge observed by Cassini. \nWhen that new image of the moon Pan reminds you of Trump, because it's 2017 and your brain is broken pic.twitter.com/rn2gEKAS7R \n— Bob Al-Greene (@BobAlGreene) March 9, 2017 \nIt's possible that there is still material from the planet's distinctive rings falling onto Pan's surface today, according to Cassini imaging lead Carolyn Porco.\nFor those who asked: Pan orbits in a ring gap of its own making. Early on & to some degree even now, ring material falls on its equator\n— Carolyn Porco (@carolynporco) March 9, 2017 \nCassini is nearing the end of its more than 10-year mission to explore Saturn and many of its 53 known moons. \nThe spacecraft has been exploring the planetary system since its arrival there in 2004, and it should continue its mission until September when it will make a planned crash into Saturn's atmosphere, burning up in the process. \nUntil then, Cassini will keep beaming back amazing new images of the world and its many moons, revealing a new side to our solar system. \nWATCH: Watch clouds move above Saturn's largest moon in new NASA video", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T18:59:38.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
