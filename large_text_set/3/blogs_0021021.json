Something to pass the day ,\" Zamolo told the inquiry's Darwin hearing. \" I can see now it was inappropriate .\" \nThe allegations relate to 2014 when the footage was posted to social media app Snapchat, according to the Sydney Morning Herald . Zamolo told the commission that he shared the videos online as he found the behavior of the inmates amusing. \nAnother clip showed a boy looking uncomfortable while urinating in a toilet when the guard allegedly said \" Oi! What are you doing, you little gay dog? \" \nZamolo rejected allegations from three separate detainees that he recorded a child masturbating in the shower. \nHe was never disciplined for any of those incidents but was later fired for an unrelated matter. \nEvidence was also given Monday by an inmate who said the guards bribed kids to fight each other for junk food. \nThe inquiry into the center is set to last two weeks and will hear from a number of politicians and guards, many of whom were involved in the tear gassing of six boys at the facility in August 2014. \nThe incident, along with an ABC investigation which revealed shocking footage of boys being assaulted and stripped at the facility, prompted a worldwide outcry, including a warning from the United Nations Human Rights Commission over possible children's rights violations. #NTRC adjourned for the day. Hearings resume tomorrow 9:30am (ACST) with evidence from former #DonDale Youth Justice Officer, Ben Kelleher. — NT Royal Comm (@NTRoyalComm) March 20, 2017 \nThe inquiry will continue Tuesday with evidence from former guard Ben Kelleher, who it is alleged attempted to cover a camera and swore at one of the tear gassed inmates, Dylan Voller.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:00:17.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
