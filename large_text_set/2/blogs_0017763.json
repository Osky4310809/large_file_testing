She is among the minority who opposed it: She is a Crimean Tatar whose grandparents — like others of her ethnic group — had been expelled by Joseph Stalin in the 1940s and exiled to Uzbekistan. Her family returned soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, but their homecoming has proved to be a nervous, tenuous existence. The protests and clashes she had photographed in the early months of the annexation have given way to an external calm marked by deep anxiety, not just about Russian intentions, but about uncertain support from the United States and Europe. As part of a Muslim minority opposed to the Russian takeover, she has seen how others have been accused of terrorism. At the same time, she’s not sure Tatars can count on the support of Western democracies that have taken a turn toward nativism. She has been trying to document the changes over the years, but it has proved challenging. Photo A woman with her child poses for in front of a Russian flag in Sevatopol, Crimea. 2015. Credit Emine Ziyatdinova “It’s not an open conflict where everything is visual,” she said. “A lot of things have changed, and it’s more like a mood, people’s behavior and some social markers. At home, in photos, it all looks the same: my parents go to work, my grandmother is at home and village life continues. But everything has drastically changed for everyone, like what people say or don’t say. Especially what they don’t say.” Part of what motivated her to go back to her project last year was seeing images by foreign photojournalists that were like “a soft version of Russian propaganda that showed beaches, pretty girls and happy Russians,” she said. “The state position is that everything is great in Crimea, everyone is happy and there is prosperity,” she said. “Everyone wants Crimea to be part of Russia, and Crimea is always Russian.” The lack of pushback to those images disappointed her, since she had known many Tatar families whose relatives had been killed or disappeared, or had been arrested on flimsy charges of terrorism or extremism. Ms. Ziyatdinova, who lives in Moscow but has returned often to the area to work as a fixer for foreign news crews, decided to explore the subject on her own terms. “I decided to go back a document people who are repressed under Russian rule,” she said.

Credit Emine Ziyatdinova While working as a fixer, she noticed other Tatars had behaved more cautiously, not talking about politics in public or at work. Even at home, people would move to the kitchen if they were to discuss current events. If they did not agree with the party line, they kept it to themselves. Her images include portrayals of daily life, along with pictures of her family. But when encountering possible subjects, she found their reticence hard to break. One time, she went to a hotel near Yalta and asked the owner a simple question — how was business — with a not-so-simple answer. “The owner said tourism was good, and she was happy to be part of Russia,” Ms. Ziyatdinova said. “But I had been there all day, and at the end of it I realized she barely made any profit because she did not have enough customers. But if you say there had not been enough tourists, that’s seen as being anti-Russian. It’s a split reality, where information is politicized and you do not want to give a wrong answer that does not follow the Russian position.” In some images, seemingly ordinary scenes turn out to have unsettling overtones, like in one photo of a man looking out a window. “He looks like a member of a regular family, but his son had been kidnapped and disappeared,” she said. “Every Tatar family is aware of disappearances of young men. In the back of their mind is the fear it could happen to anyone.” She has seen a similar fear among her family, who appear in many of the images. Her grandmother, who she said had always been vocal about her political opinions, now chided her to not talk about politics, lest they risk being arrested. To her grandmother, it was a reminder of what had happened to her father in 1937, when police hauled him out of his house one night, never to be seen again. When she returned to Crimea in the 1990s, she learned he had been executed for being an enemy of the state. “It’s sad to see people not talking about these things because we don’t live in a free country anymore,” she said. “My mother had some DVDs and CDs about Islam that someone had given her. My parents are not observant, but they believe in God and practice ethnic Islam. But she got rid of all the DVDs and CDs because she was worried if they were found in our home she would be charged with terrorism.” In the course of working on this project, she has come to the conclusion that photos alone cannot convey what she has found. She has teamed up with a writer and hopes to collaborate on a book, and she has also done videos. Photo A New Year’s celebration in Serebryanka school on December 28th, 2015.

But with all this talk in the U.S. about terrorism, Islam and the Muslim ban, who can we look to now?” Follow @ dgbxny and @ nytimesphoto on Twitter. Emine Ziyatdinova is on Instagram .
