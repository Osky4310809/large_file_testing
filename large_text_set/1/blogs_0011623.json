Sure. But before you start dreaming of eight-player Mario Kart 8 in your living room, know this: those Joy-cons don't come cheap.\nGAME is selling a pair of Joy-cons, so, a left and right Joy-con, for a whopping £74.99.\nYou can buy the things separately, too. A Joy-con right (grey), for example, costs £42.99.\nSo, what do you get for your money? Each Joy-con controller has gyro controls and \"HD rumble\", which provides chunky feedback. Nintendo gave the example of it feeling like rattling ice cubes in a glass.\nAlso part of each Joy-con is a sensor that detects simple hand gestures, such as a thumbs up, or rock, paper, scissors.\nAs demonstrated by Nintendo, you can use the new Switch Pro Controller with the games that don't require motion controls, such as 1-2 Switch. A wireless Pro Controller costs £64.99, but much cheaper is a wired Switch Horipad, which costs £27.99.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/-2nQQKyQrS0"], "published": "2017-01-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T12:20:40.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
