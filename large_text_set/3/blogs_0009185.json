As per the counting trend until 10.30 am, BJP was leading in 305 seats out of 403 seats in the state. The leads are unprecedented for the saffron party as it looks all set to form the government with more that 2/3rd majority for the first time. As per the early trends, the SP+ Congress was leading in 69 seats while the Mayawati-led BSP was ahead in just 19 seats. \nIt is a tectonic shift in the polity of India: Ravi Shankar Prasad #Verdict2017 Watch LIVE http://t.co/4fqxBVUizL pic.twitter.com/aXwZG9I7X5 \n— India Today (@IndiaToday) March 11, 2017 \nDuring the election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took it upon himself to lead the campaign for his party BJP and also sought votes in his name from the voters. It seems the voters were highly impressed by PM Modi’s growth-oriented policies while the so-called development claims of the Akhilesh Yadav government didn’t convince the voters. The final numbers of the Uttar Pradesh elections are yet to be out. \nBut if early trends are to be believed, BJP may cross the 300 seats mark, or what in cricketing parlance is known as a triple century. The results now put to rest the speculations that PM Modi’s popularity had dipped since the General Elections 2014 when an apparent Modi wave had helped BJP win 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats. The early trends also show that the surprise demonetisation decision of the Modi government couldn’t dent people’s confident in his leadership style and promises  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T08:39:36.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
