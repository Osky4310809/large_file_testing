With four superheroes in its ever-growing cast, some may even assume that the vigilantes will butt heads thanks to their powerful egos, but that doesn’t appear to be true. If you ask Finn Jones about the project, the Iron Fist star says that his character fits in with the team. And, now, the actor admits Danny Rand will share a special if not complicated relationship with Luke Cage . \nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly , the actor was asked about working with Mike Colter who plays Cage, and Jones gushed over the star. \n“I love Mike, he’s so sweet,” Jones said. “We’re working together really well, which is f—ing cool. So far all of our stuff has been like, “Whoa!”… It’s a really big thing among the fan base, and that aspect is coming through really well.” \n“The great thing about the comic books is they’re fantastic but they’re — and I don’t want to say two-dimensional — they’re comic books, and what we’re doing is we’re making more fleshed-out characters who have real problems with the world. There’s more to Danny and Luke’s characters and what they can bring to each other than the comic books ever came upon.” \nAs for what that flesh-out relationship looks like, Colter teased fans about what they can expect from the pair. \n“He’s a young guy. There’s an exuberance that Iron Fist comes with that Luke Cage wants to temper a bit,” Colter told Entertainment Weekly. “It can’t help but have a wisdom-versus-youth quality… Danny comes out like a bull in a china shop in some ways, and I think Luke has seen the world and knows certain things. It’s a cool combination that’ll work out.” \nJones will then reprise the role for Marvel’s the Defenders , which teams Iron Fist up with Marvel Television’s other Netflix stars: Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), and Luke Cage (Mike Colter). \nMarvel’s The Defenders premieres later in 2017.
