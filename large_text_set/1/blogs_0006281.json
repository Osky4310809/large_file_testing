Cyrus, who previously appeared on The Flaming Lips’ 2014 tribute to Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and teamed up with Wayne Coyne for her fifth studio album, 2015’s Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz , lends guest vocals to the track. Check it out below, or download it via iTunes . \n“We A Family” will appear as the album closer on Oczy Mlody , The Flaming Lips’ forthcoming album scheduled for release on January 13th. Their 16th effort to date also serves as their first full-length of original material since The Terror in 2013. As part of the build-up to the track’s release, The Future Heart posted a video from the recording session.
