LaVar also revealed why he believes Lonzo could be better than even Michael Jordan, why he purposely made Lonzo’s high school teams worse, and why all three of his sons will be one-and-dones in college. \nOh, and LaVar also broke down how the Lakers could become a playoff team overnight by picking Ball in this year’s draft (if they’re lucky enough to keep their pick, of course): CHRIS: “So you’ve said you want him to go to the Lakers. If he’s on the Lakers next year, how good are they? … Playoffs?” LAVAR: “Yeah. I would have to say playoffs the first year. Because what would happen is, with the team that they have, Lonzo could let D’Angelo go right back to his two-spot, which is scoring the ball. What he did for Mt. Verde and for Ohio State — he wasn’t designated point guard. He’d throw some nice passes, wasn’t no pressure on him to run no team. Just do what you do when you could. “They need to change Brandon Ingram into a slasher, where that boy can get out on that wing and get that ball to him early, and he’s playing one-on-one. I feel like Lonzo is the only one that can pretty much run what Luke Walton wants to do, and that’s why I think it’s a perfect fit. And I like the fact that Magic has just gotten there.” \nBall also talks about the relationship between NBA players and apparel companies and what that means for Lonzo moving forward, whether he could average a triple-double in the NBA, and just what makes the Ball boys such special prospects on the court. \nYou’ll definitely want to give this wide-ranging conversation a listen; by the end of the podcast, Ball will have you believing you have the strength to run through a brick wall. \nAnd there’s more where that came from. Broussard also details how sunny days are just around the corner for the Lakers with or without Ball.
