Aesthetically, the design of the new stadium is inspired by Gothic architecture, while Victorian-era brick terraces will wrap around the building.\nHowever, the stadium only recently received approval by Hammersmith and Fulham council’s planning committee, and will still require more approval specifically by London Mayor Sadiq Khan before construction can officially begin.\nStay tuned for further updates on the construction process, and hopefully we get some sick drone footage to go long with it :\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:41:47.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
