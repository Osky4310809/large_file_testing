Despite nearing their fifth year anniversary as an idol group, she revealed that the group still has not turned a profit yet, saying that she hasn’t been able to send money home to her parents. \nShe confessed, “Actually, my agency doesn’t like it when I say things like this but although we’ve passed four years as a group, we haven’t made any income. But since I was on a few talk shows last year, we did make some profit but it isn’t enough.” \nHowever, Cao Lu showed that she is nonetheless a faithful daughter, revealing that when she was younger, she had been able to give a big present to her parents. \nShe revealed, “When I was 17, I bought an apartment in Beijing. I was lucky and as soon as I debuted, I won the newbie award from CCTV. As I was promoting for two years, I was thinking of buying a car but my mom told me to buy a house so I did.” \nCao Lu continued, “The price of the apartment has gone up a lot but when I bought it, it was inexpensive. The price has gone up about five times now. During the summers, my parents go to live there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T05:59:17.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
