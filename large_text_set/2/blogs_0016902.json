Sneakerheads and fashion enthusiasts will have likely heard the name from the use of these leathers in their favorite products, ranging from New Balance sneakers to watch bands , and now the latest to join the Horween-imbued lineup are two new pairs from Timberland’s repertoire – the 6-Inch Boot and 3-Eye Lug.\nWhile the original silhouettes of both models remain largely unchanged, the 6-Inch will be replacing its nubuck upper entirely with Horween leather, while 3-Eye Lug will also be following suit. Additionally, the collar of the 6-Inch will offer a breathable perforated option.\nThe Horween x Timberland 6-Inch boot will retail for $350 USD while 3-Eye Lug will retail for $200 USD. Expect both to drop soon at Timberland specialty retail stores as well as Timberland’s official site on February 24.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T10:01:26.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
