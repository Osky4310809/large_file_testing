The human of the German Shepherd rescued the crow when he found her orphaned in the woods. He taught her how to fly and the bird and his dog became friends. When the crow grew up, she went away for a while, but soon returned. The bird stopped at home nearly every day asking for food and wanting to play. \nAccording to the man, the crow sometimes brought home stolen things from the neighbors, which he then had to bring back to his neighbors. I’ve heard that crows sometimes bring “treasures” to their families. \nWhat a fascinating animal friendship. Share this video with your friends and family!
