Brown \nDenver prosecutors have charged a 23-year-old man with a gang-related murder in 2012 in the Montbello neighborhood when he was 17. \nBrandon D. Brown, is accused of first-degree murder and other crimes in the death of James Dishmon, 25, near 55th Avenue and Wheeling Street. \nAnother suspect, Julian Ballard-Wheeler, 22, is in custody and is scheduled for preliminary hearing Feb. 24. \nDishmon, known as “Too Tight,” was shot along with three others, all of whom survived, by three men who walked up to them and began shooting, according to an arrest affidavit. \nAn informant said Brown, a member of a Crips gang set known as “Little Gangsta Bang,” and two other gang members were the shooters, the affidavit said. \nThe shooting took place after a member of the Geer Gang stole a gun from one of Brown’s associates. The informant told a detective that Brown “grabbed a couple of homies” who then went to Montbello and did the shooting,” according to the affidavit. \nIn a conversation with an informant wearing a wire, Ballard-Wheeler, known as “Tiny Solo,” said the three originally were “going to walk and tell them to give the gun back. When they saw so many individuals present on Wheeling, they walked like 3 feet past their cars and started to ‘dump’ on them.” \nAs Ballard-Wheeler spoke he “used sounds” to describe the gun fire. \nDishmon was shot once in the left chest, and the bullet exited his right side. He was declared dead at Denver Health medical center. \nBrown is in federal custody in Phoenix for a prior narcotics conviction. The district attorney’s office has requested to bring him to Denver for first advisement, scheduled for March 9. \nBallard-Wheeler, who was arrested last year, is set for a preliminary hearing in Denver Courtroom 5G on Feb. 24. He remains in custody, without bail. \nBoth men were arrested after a review by Denver’s Cold Case Unit teams, the Cold Case Unit of the Denver Police Department and the Cold Case Unit of the district attorney’s office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:40:07.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
