All we did was Quote: a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible fot saying that on television. I didn't make an opinion on it,\" Trump said.\nTapper ripped into Trump's remarks.\n\"The White House, apparently unaware that when the White House in the world's most powerful nation cites a news story as proof of what the president of the United States has said that that tends to suggest to people that you think you believe the story you're citing as proof.\"\n\"But now in a fevered effort to try and force this outlandish claim into something remotely resembling — passably, perhaps, maybe the truth, the White House appears actually willing to repeat another wild accusation that could potentially alienate our nation's most important ally,\" Tapper said.\nHe continued: \"Does smearing British intelligence make your family more safe? No? So, why is the White House doing it? What is the White House defending here?\"\n\"Because it damn sure isn't national security or American credibility before the world,\" Tapper said.\nMultiple US officials, the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee, Global Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), and current and former Obama associates have denied all of the Trump administration's claims that Obama directed a spy operation at Trump. But the White House has persisted.\nWatch Tapper's remarks below: Epic rant by @jaketapper on Trump just now.\n\"Embarrassment\"\n\"Outlandish claim\"\n\"Wild accusation\" pic.twitter.com/ZNJdbeFJKo\n— Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) March 17, 2017 SEE ALSO: Trump, confronted on wiretapping claims, tells Merkel: 'At least we have something in common, perhaps' DON'T MISS: The White House has reportedly apologized to Britain over debunked Trump Tower wiretapping accusations NOW WATCH: 'Why are you scared of diversity in the news?': German reporter confronts Trump with pointed question on media Loading video...
