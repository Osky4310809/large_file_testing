I got my prosthetic legs just before Christmas. \n“They’re very heavy. It’s hard, like walking with stilts – but the thought of walking down the aisle has kept me going. Shaun Whiter in his football team line up \n“I’m using one crutch. The plan is to walk unaided, then I’ll be out attacking the world.” \nHis fiancee Charlotte took a year out from work to care for him and set up a JustGiving page which raised more than £100,000 to pay for his ­rehabilitation. \n“I’m so grateful to everyone for their support – family, friends and the football community, from Cambridge United , Ipswich Town and my old team Newmarket.” Jan Adamec who ran into Shaun (Photo: SWNS) \n“Now I can’t wait for our wedding day. The church has cobbled floors so I will need to learn to walk on that. \nShaun, who needs treatment four times a week, admits he has his “down moments”. But he says: “Charlotte picks me up. She makes me feel things are possible.” \nIn September, driver Jan Adamec, 40, was jailed for 40 months for the crash, which left Shaun’s pal Joey Abbs with serious leg injuries.
