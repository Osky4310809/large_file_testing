Now, they are demanding EPA turn over records the conservative group requested nearly one-and-a-half years ago. \nPresident Donald Trump ordered a freeze on all EPA grants shortly after taking office. Trump’s budget proposal calls for eliminating EPA’s environmental justice program, which prompted the head of the program to resign. \nMustafa Ali, the head of EPA’s environmental justice program, resigned in early March, publishing a resignation letter that urged EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt not to kill the program. \n“When I hear we are considering making cuts to grant programs like the EJ small grants or Collaborative Problem Solving programs, which have assisted over 1,400 communities, I wonder if our new leadership has had the opportunity to converse with those who need our help the most,” Ali wrote in his letter. \n“I strongly encourage you and your team to continue promoting agency efforts to validate these communities’ concerns, and value their lives,” Ali wrote to Pruitt. \nEPA has spent $24 million since 1994 as part of a “small grants” program that funds environmental projects carried out by activists and community groups. One project funded the Connecticut-based Green Jobs Corps’ plans to educate the youth about threats to water quality. \nEPA also funds cooperative agreements with activist and community groups. One such agreement with the Montachusett Opportunity Council (MOC) seeks to “raise community awareness about stormwater runoff and water pollution prevention.” \nEPA defines environmental justice as “the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.” \nIn all, EPA spends about $4 billion a year on grants to outside groups and state and tribal agencies. Environmental groups also benefit from EPA grants , and some of those same activist groups oppose Trump’s budget cuts. \nFollow Michael on Facebook and Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
