To be clear, Trump was was once again raising questions about the legitimacy of his own triumph. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 \nSo in the latest must-watch White House press conference of the Trump-era, it was only natural questions would be asked by reporters about the claim. \nIn response, Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that Trump believes millions of people voted illegally in November’s election - despite a total absence of evidence to support this view. He told reporters: “The president does believe that. He has stated that before. I think he’s stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him.” Pressed for evidence to support the claim, Spicer said: “I think the president has believed that for a while, based on studies and information he has.” \nSpicer referred to a Pew study, and claimed it showed that 14% of non-citizens were registered to vote. It doesn’t show that. What it does state is that dead people are on electoral rolls and other records are out-of-date - but it makes no reference to voter fraud. A study claiming non-citizens were registered to vote has also been debunked. Both are detailled here . \nAsked why Trump had not prioritised an investigation into an issue that would be “a scandal of astronomical proportions”, Spicer said: “Maybe we will. We’ll see where we go from here.” \nThe erroneous claim comes as Trump appears obsessed with reports of the diminished turn-out to his inauguration. Reuters Staff / Reuters A combination of photos taken at the National Mall shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (L) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama at 1:27pm on January 20, 2009, in Washington, U.S. \nOn Saturday, he sent out Spicer to hold an impromptu and now infamous news conference and make a series of eyebrow-raising claims - including that Trump attracted the biggest audience to “ever witness an inauguration - period - both in person and around the globe”. \nTrump won the presidency with a majority of the Electoral College, though Clinton won nearly 3 million more popular votes than Trump did.
