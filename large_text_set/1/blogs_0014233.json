Although I haven't had this dinner in years, I remember it fondly and sometimes find myself craving a bowl of creamy stovetop mac and cheese. I considered giving the old package a try, but the thought of powdered cheese made me cringe. That's why I decided to make my own version of Kraft's classic mac. \nSurprisingly, it's very quick and easy to put together, and the resulting dish is comforting and nostalgic yet a little bit higher-brow. To ensure a smooth, rich texture, I combined Velveeta — what can I say, it's a guilty pleasure ! — with a good-quality, extrasharp cheddar. The mixture works wonderfully, and from now on instead of reaching for a box, I'll reach for this recipe.
