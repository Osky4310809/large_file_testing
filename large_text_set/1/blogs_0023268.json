One of them, Darweesh, has now been released, but it’s not clear what’s happening with Alshawi’s situation. They are not alone either; it’s believed other refugees were detained at airports also after Trump put pen to executive order paper. \nA federal judge granted an emergency stay of Trump’s executive order on the evening of January 28. According to ABC News, “The ruling does not appear to overturn administration policy, but does appear to apply to all of those people currently detained at airports across the country who were facing imminent deportation.” \nAccording to CNN, Darweesh was released due to exemptions in Trump’s order “that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US.” \nABC News reported that the men are not technically refugees under Trump’s executive order. \n“This is the soul of America. This is what pushed me to leave my country and come here, Darweesh said upon release, surrounded by people who worked to free him. “America is the land of freedom. The land of the right. I am very thankful.” \nHe added, “America is the greatest nation. The greatest people in the world.” Of Trump, he said, “I like him, but I don’t know. This is a policy, I don’t know.” He said he didn’t understand why he was treated like he did something wrong. Hameed Khalid Darweesh on President Trump: “I like him, but I don’t know. This is a policy, I don’t know.” https://t.co/Sf0Zka9pIm \n— Joshua Chavers (@JoshuaChavers) January 28, 2017 \nThe detainment sparked immediate outrage because Darweesh, in particular, had helped the U.S. military. Brandon Friedman, former deputy assistant secretary for public affairs, wrote on Twitter: “Guy literally spent years keeping U.S. soldiers alive in combat in Iraq. He was one of the first to sign up in 2003. He is fearless.” \nBoth men are married fathers and their families are already in the United States. In the case of Darweesh, the lawsuit describes a tense and dramatic scene as the former U.S. military interpreter arrived at a New York airport with his family, only to be separated from them. The rest of the family managed to leave the airport. Alshawi is an accountant whose wife worked for a U.S. contractor; members of his family were already murdered by insurgents. \nA lawsuit filed on their behalf contends that Darweesh and Alshawi will be in “grave danger” if they are forced to return to Iraq. \nThey had the misfortune of being in the air and not yet on American soil when the executive order was signed by Trump. Trump’s order temporarily bans immigration from Iraq and a series of other Muslim-majority countries and gives entrance priority to those from minority religions, such as Christian. \nHere’s what you need to know: 1.

Frank Legal Services Organization, International Refugee Assistance Project, the National Immigration Law Center, American Civil Liberties Union Foundation and Kilpatrick Townsend& Stockton LLP. \nThe lawsuit cites the 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, alleging that the detainees were not given due process rights as required under it. The suit contends the man were denied their due process rights to “apply for asylum” and that Trump’s executive order violates the equal protection clause within it. That Amendment reads: \nNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. \nThe lawsuit also mentions the 14th Amendment, which reads: \nAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \nThe 14th Amendment granted rights to African-American slaves after the Civil War, according to History.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T08:21:12.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
