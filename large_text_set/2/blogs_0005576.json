That's the truth. It's not a publicity stunt.\" The rumors didn't die—but Hiddleswift did in September, when Us Weekly reported they broke up right before the Emmys. (Swift reportedly didn't like how public Hiddleston made the whole thing.) But now, perhaps the greatest sign that Hiddleswift was real has come out. Hiddleston opened up to GQ about the relationship...and he really, really is heartbroken about it still. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below On the beach in England during the summer AKM-GSI It started out diplomatically, with what GQ writer Taffy Brodesser-Aknerr described as a statement-like quote Hiddleston gave when first asked about Swift: \"Taylor is an amazing woman. She's generous and kind and lovely, and we had the best time...Of course it was real.\" Most Popular The Rise and Fall of Hiddleswift The I Heart TS tank \"was a joke among friends.\" And he could have left it at that. But he didn't—he launched into an explanation on how much the backlash and scrutiny ate at him: \nI have to be so psychologically strong about not letting other people's interpretations about my life affect my life. A relationship exists between two people. We will always know what it was. The narratives that are out there altogether have been extrapolated from pictures that were taken without consent or permission, with no context. Nobody had the context for that story. And I'm still trying to work out a way of having a personal life and protecting it, but also without hiding. So the hardest thing is that that was a joke among friends on the Fourth of July. \nI don't know. I just, I was surprised. I was just surprised that it got so much attention. The tank top became an emblem of this thing.

A relationship in the limelight… A relationship always takes work. A relationship in the limelight takes work. And it's not just the limelight. It's everything else.\" The two wanted a regular relationship. \"So we decided to go out for dinner, we decided to travel...\"   breakup was hard for Hiddleston—partly because it was so public and any sad face could make a tabloid story, partly because it was Swift. Chris Hemsworth, Hugh Laurie, and his family were all apparently concerned. In December Bauer-Griffin Brodesser-Akner interviewed Hiddleston at the beginning of January—but the most telling detail of Hiddleston's state came the morning she was scheduled to leave England. He emailed her and asked to come to her hotel room to say one last thing for the piece. She said yes, and he came. Brodesser-Akner describes below what happened: \nHe wants me to know that he has no regrets, he says, \"because you have to fight for love. You can't live in fear of what people might say. You know, you have to be true to yourself.\" \n...I turn my tape recorder off and I stand up, but he doesn't. He shakes his head again, his hands clasped together, and he hangs his head. I sit back down and we talk some more because I finally understand that he isn't here as someone who needs to explain his side in a PR battle; he's here as someone who is still crushed by the end of a relationship. \nSo we sit and talk for a while. We talk about how relationships go sideways, how the ripples of a breakup can still pin you to a wall even months later. We talk about heartache. We talk about sadness and healing. We talk about what it's like to love and what happens when the object of that love withdraws but all your love is still there. We talk about how those things can really change a person. The world will chip away at your optimism, and you just have to fight back. You have to be someone who is still full of joy and full of love, who can still use a word like \"obsessed\" about porridge. You have to be bold and open. You have to be honest. You have to be like Tom Hanks. We all have to be more like Tom Hanks. Read the entire interview here .
