John McCain (R-AZ) released a statement confirming that he provided the dossier Buzzfeed published to FBI Director James Comey . \n“Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.” \nLast night, CNN reported that intelligence chiefs presented Trump with a two-page synopsis of claims of Russian efforts to compromise him during their intelligence briefing on Russian hacking. That synopsis is reportedly based on a 35-page dossier that Buzzfeed published yesterday. \nIn publishing the document, Buzzfeed noted that there were many unverified and likely unverifiable claims made, along with some clear errors. Editor-in-chief Ben Smith tweeted out an explanatory letter he sent to his staff where he said in was not an easy or simple choice to publish the doc. \nFollowing both reports, Trump took to Twitter to call them “fake news” and a “political witch hunt.” He continued hammering the reports this morning on Twitter ahead of a planned press conference while members of his staff appeared on morning news shows to hit back the allegations. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T18:29:23.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
