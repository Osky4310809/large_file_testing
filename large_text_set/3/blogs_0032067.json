He’s a great leader. As a hockey player, he does everything really well. He can skate, he’s got great vision, he can score. He’s an all-around complete hockey player. He’s a really great leader, great in the dressing room and off the ice as a person.” \nAccording to the Grand Forks Herald , Jost becomes the first North Dakota player to sign an NHL contract after his freshman season since goaltender Ed Belfour in 1987. \nJost was raised in the Edmonton suburb of St. Albert. His mother, Laura, is a senior manager for Bell Canada and she was Tyson’s hockey coach when he was young. He has a younger sister, Kacey. When Tyson was 13, his grandparents moved to Kelowna, British Columbia, so he could attend and play hockey at the Pursuit of Excellence school there. \nAt the draft, Tyson's grandfather, Jim Jost, was shown on the broadcast in tears. \n\"I thought it was special,\" Tyson said during a post-draft visit to Denver. \"Everybody could see his true colors and how much pride he has in the game of hockey and how much he did for me and my family. He was a little bit embarrassed once we were telling him, ‘Hey, you're pretty famous on Twitter right now.' He's embarrassed, but I'm proud of him. I'm proud of the person he is.\" \nJost said that after the draft, his mother texted him when she arrived back at her desk at Bell Canada in Edmonton, saying, \"I guess I'm back to reality now. The movie's done, the dream's over.\" Tyson added that he responded, \"Aw, it's not over yet, Mom, we'll keep working and make another one.\" \nAt the National Collegiate Hockey Conference's recent Frozen Faceoff tournament, the Post's Mike Chambers asked Jost about the Avalanche's dreadful season. \n“It’s surprising,\" Jost said. \"I mean, I think they’re better than a lot of people look at them. They have a lot of skill up front. I don’t know if I can really comment because I’m not around the team or anything like that. I try to watch them whenever I get a chance, and obviously it’s unfortunate they’re not doing the best. But I have a lot of faith in the organization, just after meeting with the management at the beginning of the year. I’m still really proud and honored to be part of that organization, and whenever my time is to go with them I’ll be excited to go up with them for sure.” \nThat'll happen Thursday. The hope is that he arrives in time to be able to go though a physical and be on the ice for at least part of the scheduled practice. If all are comfortable at that point that he's ready to go, and there are no work visa complications, he will play against the Blues. \nAnd next season? Is Sakic remains on the job, and it wouldn't be surprising if Jost and his camp received an assurance that they were dealing with the man who still will be running the Avalanche next season, his revamp will get into high gear. Part of that plan was to tie up the six-man \"core\" - Semyon Varlamov, Erik Johnson, Tyson Barrie, MacKinnon, Matt Duchene and Gabe Landeskog - to long-term contracts and continue to fill in around them, increasingly with young prospects as time passed. Varlamov, who underwent season-ending hip surgery in February, remains both a questionmark and untradable, but the others - yes, even MacKinnon - aren't immune to being traded for the right offer as Sakic attempts to make this horrible season a memory, not a trend. \nAs it stands now, minus trades or significant free agent signings, Colorado's top six forwards figure to come from among MacKinnon, Rantanen, Landeskog, Duchene, Jost, J.T. Compher, most likely Sven Andrighetto (a pending restricted free agent), and current San Antonio Rampage winger A.J. Greer. \nThe Avalanche also has two past draft choices - DU senior defenseman Will Butcher (fifth round in 2013) and Notre Dame left wing Cam Morrison (second round, 2016) - playing in the upcoming Frozen Four in Chicago. Butcher is 22, Morrison still only 18. \nThe Pioneers and Fighting Irish will meet in one semifinal on April 6. The Avalanche regular season ends with a game at St. Louis on April 9, the day after the championship game. Especially because of Morrison's age, it seems likely the Avalanche will be fine with him remaining at Notre Dame at least one more season. Butcher could become a free agent if he hasn't signed with Colorado by mid-August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:30:53.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
