Are you? Hi. I’m popping in quickly to ask an honest question, and I’m hoping for genuine answers. Are you happy after this week? Because I’m not. I’m an emotional wreck. A lot of us are. Everything we feared is happening, and worse. But I want to know if you, rabid Trump supporter, are still happy and high on the Trump Train. Are you? Because while I was taking Trump literally but not seriously, I was told that I needed to take him seriously but not literally like you were. But he’s literally doing exactly what he said he would. Should I take that seriously? Are you? Because when the racist, xenophobic promise of a wall between us and Mexico was chanted, I was more concerned about how the world would perceive our racism than I was of an actual, literal wall being built — that’s beyond crazy, I thought. But here we are. He’s literally signed an executive order promising a wall will be built between us and the country where you go to drink at your all-inclusive resorts. Does that wall make you feel safer? Are you? Because when I said I was concerned for the environment and the national parks, you told me it would be fine. This week a gag order was placed on government scientists, in addition to many others. He literally silenced intelligence because he doesn’t understand it and sometimes facts are inconvenient compared to potential profits. I’m scared. Are you? Because when I peacefully marched in Washington one week ago you told me that we were all already equal and that the march was a vulgar display of privilege. We’re all equal, unless we were born in the wrong country, born the wrong gender, believe in the wrong God, believe in the wrong facts (science)... We’re not equal. Aren’t you happy you’re a white American who believes in a Christian God (but not Christian principles)? Because you told me what he posted on Twitter didn’t matter. It was all show. Did you know that this week a foreign leader canceled a trip via Twitter? It matters. Are you paying attention? Because people will literally die when the Affordable Care Act is repealed (and certainly in no way immediately replaced), but you wanted to save a bit of money. Are you proud to add to your pile of cash while others die with the lack of affordable coverage? Because families are already being torn apart due to this racist travel ban. The most vulnerable people in the world will die. Do you feel Christian supporting that? Are you? Because I’ve spent my life fascinated and horrified by how Nazis came to power. How fascism came to be in a country so like ours, in a decade not that long ago. How people were silenced and bullied into accepting fear, hatred and murder as part of daily life through tearing them down and building them up with propaganda. I’ve read so many books and have watched so many documentaries, and the parallels are uncanny. And you told me that would never happen. This is nothing like that. I was being crazy. Are you watching? Because I am, and I’m horrified. This is not normal. I’m not judging you if you’re happy, but I want to understand how. I don’t listen or watch the same right wing rage media as you do, so I want to understand how this is being spun to make it be “right.” Because I’m taking this both literally and seriously.
