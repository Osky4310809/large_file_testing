It wasn't frightened - but we kept our distance - and once it went back into the tree it was camouflaged - so out of sight, out of mind.'' Woman bitten by non-venomous green tree snake at Australia Zoo Madura McCormack, The Courier-Mail January 2, 2017 4:58pm \nA WOMAN has been bitten by a wild snake at Australia Zoo this afternoon. \nAustralia Zoo said it was the first time in their 46 year history that a guest had ever been bitten by a snake. \nThe reptile was a wild one and is believed to have come from the Australia Zoo Wetlands area. Happy to report guest and snake are both just fine. https://t.co/1Bw2l6kp5N — Terri Irwin (@TerriIrwin) January 2, 2017 \n“The snake was identified as a green tree snake, which is a common occurrence in the Wetlands, as it is the perfect environment for their favourite food, frogs,” a spokesman said. \n“While Green tree snakes are not venomous, we followed first aid protocol and the guest was taken to hospital.” \nEmergency services were called to the Queensland attraction on Steve Irwin Way just after 1pm and took the woman, in her 20s, to Caloundra Hospital. \nTerri Irwin later tweeted: “Happy to report guest and snake are both just fine”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T12:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T08:17:29.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
