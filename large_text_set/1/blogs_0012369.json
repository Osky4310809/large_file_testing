Kodak Black offered to fight Lil Wayne over the “best rapper alive” title, 22 Savage wanted to box his namesake 21 Savage for that title, and RiFF RAFF wanted fisticuffs with 50 Cent for $2 million , because why not? Meek Mill versus Drake is just the latest speculative bout. \nIt’s a fight that’s been a long time coming ever since Meek accused Drake in 2015 of using a ghostwriter . After that, the 6 God wrecked the Philly rapper back to back, both in song form and in literal form as Meek became the ubiquitous symbol for taking an “L.” \nThe newly single Dreamchasers boss even offered up his ex-girlfriend Nicki Minaj to be the ring card girl for the match. \n“Y’all would come and see that fight wouldn’t y’all?” Meek asks in the above video clip. “Y’all would pay $100 a ticket for that.” \nYes, the world would absolutely love to see Meek and Drake go at it pound for pound. \nGet The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
