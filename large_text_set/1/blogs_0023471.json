I’m supposed to start talking. I’m sorry. I’m sick. \nOn behalf of this fearless and talented cast, we would like to thank -- oh, it's so heavy -- Netflix, Shawn [Levy], Matt [Duffer], Ross [Duffer] and the amazing casting director Carmen Cuba . \nI would just like to say that in light of all that’s going on in the world today, it’s difficult to celebrate the already celebrated “Stranger Things,” but this award from you, who take your craft seriously and earnestly believe, like me, that great acting can change the world, is a call to arms from our fellow craftsmen and women to go deeper and through our art battle against fear, self-centeredness and exclusivity of our predominantly narcissistic culture. And through our craft to cultivate a more empathetic and understanding society by revealing intimate truths that serve as a forceful reminder to folks that when they feel broken and afraid and tired, they are not alone. \nWe are united, in that we are all human beings and we are all together on this horrible, painful, joyous, exciting and mysterious ride that is being alive. \nAs we act and the continuing narrative of “Stranger Things,” we 1983 Midwesterners will repel bullies. We will shelter freaks and outcasts, those who have no homes. We will get past the lies. We will hunt monsters. And when we are lost amidst the hypocrisy and casual violence of certain individuals and institutions, we will, as per Chief Jim Hopper, punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy the meek and the disenfranchised and the marginalized. And we will do it all with soul, with heart, and with joy. \nWe thank you for this responsibility. We thank you.
