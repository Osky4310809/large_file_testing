Not too surprising considering that he's, you know, a pitcher in the American League. But when it came time to pick out his number after signing with the Padres , Weaver knew the best person to emulate: Mike Trout and his No. 27. \nPlayers choosing the number of a player they grew up idolizing isn't very strange. Choosing the number of your ex-teammate that is nine years younger? That's a little different. \n\"I figured I've got to hit [with the Padres],\" the hurler told MLB.com's AJ Cassavell. \"I went Mike Trout on them, so maybe that'll help with my hitting. The numbers were slim pickings. I texted Trout and asked him if it was OK. He said he couldn't wait to see 27 on my back.\" \nWhile Weaver did put together an epic two-game hitting streak in 2010, if the right-hander comes out of Spring Training showing off power, speed and a patient batting eye, I think we'll know: It's not the player that has won two MVP awards and finished second three other times -- it's the number.
