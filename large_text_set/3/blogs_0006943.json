However, last season, the 49ers went 2-14 under first-year head coach Chip Kelly — who was fired after the season. They switched quarterbacks from Blaine Gabbert to Colin Kaepernick, who completed just 59.2-percent of his passes in 11 starts amid the National Anthem protest controversy thing . \nThat’s one end of Smith’s production spectrum. \nRelated: Howie Roseman: Joe Douglas Will Run Personnel Department \nThe other end of that spectrum came in 2013 — the year after Baltimore won the Super Bowl — when Smith caught 65 balls for 1,128 yards and four touchdowns averaging 17.4 yards per catch. The following season Smith caught 49 balls for 767 yards and a career-high 11 scores. \nWe shouldn’t expect the 2016 Smith nor the 2013 Smith playing with the big-arm of Joe Flacco, but a veteran receiver who can stretch the defense and account for about 40/700/5 is certainly in the realm of possibilities.
