And monthly subscription box What's in Your Box? intends to eliminate this shameful taboo and normalize the conversation about sex for women. To encourage an open dialogue about sex, pleasure, and STI prevention, WIYB delivers four to five product samples related to sexual health, hygiene, pleasure, and empowerment. Not only does the curated experience allow you to experiment free of embarrassment , but it also serves to educate you about your body.\nWIYB founder Christine Long found there was stigma surrounding female pleasure and wanted to create an affordable and comfortable way for women to explore their sexuality. \"I was inspired to start WIYB after my own personal run-in with STIs, which caused me to feel a lot of shame around my body and sexuality,\" Christine told us. \"As a young woman in her 20s wanting to explore sex, I felt there were no relatable brands or resources I could turn to that would help me take charge of my sexual health.\"\nRelated:\nI Got a Taste of an All-Female Play Party and It Was Everything I Imagined, in the Best Way\nChristine also noticed the \"prevalent orgasm gap\" between heterosexual men and women and sought to make a change. WIYB was then born as a solution featuring a curated selection of existing female products for safer and more satisfying sex lives. Monthly deliveries are discreet and include items from toys to washes, lubricants, lingerie, condoms, and more. Subscriptions range from $15 to $18 per month, but each box retails up to $50. In addition to products, each box comes with a two-sided tip card that aligns with the month's theme. You'll receive information about each item, how to use it, and a WIYB tip for maximum satisfaction.\nBy using a humorous undertone in its deliveries and blog, Sex, Feels and Feminism , WIYB attempts to make women feel more at ease about the sex life they want. \"We are here to shed light on topics that many people think are 'uncomfortable' so that our network knows they are not alone in their feelings, desires and concerns,\" Christine said.\nIn honor of Vulva Health Awareness Month, WIYB also recently teamed up with graphic designer Cristina Vanko and copywriter Eileen Matthews to create illustrations about knowing and loving your body. A couple of the colorful pieces hilariously incorporate Beyonc√© lyrics, so you know they're good.
