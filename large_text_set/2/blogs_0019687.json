He also photoshopped Carson’s face on to the front of a Dr Seuss book, called How the Grinch Stole Housing. Late night TV hosts on Trump's Sweden gaffe: 'never fjorget' Read more \nTrump’s visit also allowed for yet more bragging about his win in certain states although Colbert used this as a reminder that he did fail to obtain the popular vote. “He’s still president, he’s just a loser president,” he said. \nHe went on to talk about last week’s day without immigrants, where many immigrants didn’t go to work in protest. “I thought that’s what Trump called it when Melania stays in New York,” he said. \nThe issue of Trump’s obsession with playing golf also came up. “Six times in 30 days?” he said. “That does explain the bumper sticker on Air Force One: I’d rather be golfing and there’s a 20% chance that I am.” \nHis aides have claimed that he could in fact be on the course for something other than golf. “He could be on the course for any reason,” Colbert agreed. “We know he loves making fun of people’s handicaps.” \nOn Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host joked about a report that Trump and Pence shared a dinner in the White House. “Pence said ‘grace’ and Trump said ‘there were 1.5 million people at my inauguration’,” he said. \nHe also said that Trump’s visit to the National Museum of African American History and Culture was “part of his ongoing quest to find Barack Obama’s birth certificate”. \nDuring his visit, Trump was asked about the rise in attacks against Jewish people. “He denounces antisemitism with the same energy you use to thank your aunt when she gives you socks for Christmas,” he said. \nHe then referenced a mistake that saw Pence speak in front of an American flag that had one extra star “in honor of the new 51st state: panic”. \nOn The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon dressed up as Trump again and talked about his busy weekend: “I shot four under par.” \nIn character, he claimed that it was “time for me to take matters into my own abnormally gigantic hands” and launched TNN: Trump News Network. \nHe called it: “The only news network that is 100% fair and 112% factual.” \nThe first story related to the fabricated attack in Sweden: “Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the Swedish men, women and fish.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:04:09.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
