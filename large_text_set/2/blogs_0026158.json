That's having something inside you. It is right that they are asked questions because it wasn't as though we were suddenly seeing 11 fantastic footballers, we were just seeing a team fully committed.

In some ways it may even reinforce that they haven't done enough for Claudio Ranieri.\" \nFellow Monday Night Football analyst, Gary Neville, agreed the victory was secured through effort and work-rate, rather than a change in tactics from interim boss Craig Shakespeare. \nNeville said he struggled to understand why Leicester haven't approached their last few matches in the same way. \n\"It's difficult to explain,\" Neville said. There's no way that Craig Shakespeare, in two days, can do anything tactically with these players. Jamie Vardy says Leicester’s 3-1 win against Liverpool was a reaction to the criticism the players have received \n\"It's all about mentality and ability and players will decide whether they want to play or whether they don't. They've decided tonight they want to play. \n\"They've broken most of their running stats for two seasons and with their attitude and aggression, if Claudio Ranieri is watching I think he'll be thinking to himself 'where was that two weeks ago?' \n\"I don't quite get it in my own mind how players can switch the tap on and off just like that. I get the fact they might dip in confidence, but to see such a shift… \n\"Liverpool have been woeful by the way, however Leicester from minute one, have simplified the game, have gone direct, have disturbed Liverpool and they've been absolutely brilliant. \n\"I don't know how it's happened, but it has happened.\" Man Utd vs B'mouth", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:20:43.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
