CNN reported on the exchange: Gorsuch pushed back against Democratic criticism that he has mostly ruled in favor of big companies or government, arguing Tuesday that he’s ruled in favor of “the little guy,” as well. “I’d like to convey to you — from the bottom of my heart — is that I am a fair judge,” Gorsuch said to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s top Democrat. He listed off a number of cases in which he felt he ruled against “the big guy.” “I have participated in 2,700 opinions over 10 and a half years. And, if you want cases where I’ve ruled for the little guy as well as the big guy, there are plenty of them,” he said. He specifically listed ruling in favor of landowners in a lawsuit over nuclear waste at the Rocky Flats plant, which he said “vindicated the rights of people who had been subject to pollution by large companies in Colorado.” But you really need to see it to understand how well spoken and respectful Gorsuch was to a rather ridiculous question:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:20:08.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
