Notice the distinct lack of a P (for performance) in those names. \n-Sacrificing performance in the name of range, the Model S 100D boasts a claimed EPA driving range of 335 miles on a single charge from its 100.0-kWh battery. That’s 20 miles more than the P100D and 41 miles better than the 90D, and it pads the Model S’s lead for the longest range of any production battery-electric vehicle. In the 100D configuration, the top speed of 155 mph remains, but Tesla’s claimed zero-to-60-mph time of 4.2 seconds is now level with its claim for the 90D—although both pale in contrast to Tesla’s assertion that its P100D can achieve zero to 60 mph in only 2.5 seconds. In our tests, a P90D got to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds.\n-At a starting price of $93,700, the new Model S 100D costs $3000 more than the 90D and $42,000 less than the $135,700 P100D.\n- \n-The other new darling, the Model X 100D, offers 295 miles of EPA-rated range on a single charge, which is 38 miles better than the 90D and six miles better than the P100D version of the Model X. Tesla claims the Model X 100D scoots to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds, same as the X 90D and 1.9 seconds slower than the X P100D. Like the Model S 100D, the Model X 100D, at $99,700, costs $3000 more than the 90D version but $37,000 less than the maximized-performance Model X P100D.\n- - Tesla’s Unlimited Free Charging Is Over—Meaning Used Teslas Just Became More Valuable - Elon Musk: A New Tesla Roadster Is “Some Years Away” - Tesla: Model S, Model X, and Model 3 Full Info, Specs, and Reviews - -With its 90D and 100D models so close in price, it will be interesting to see how long Tesla keeps the 90D in its portfolio.
