It’s a treadmill and that’s a good thing. No matter who you are or what your current tastes may be, there’s little doubt that you can find something that appeals to you each week. Whether you’re looking for superheroes, creator-owned inventions, new translations, or something else, there’s always a new comic waiting just around the corner. \nHowever, that rate of publication can make it difficult to keep up on all of the announcements. That’s why we’re putting together a list of the most notable new releases coming up in the month of February 2017. Rather than spend hours parsing through the Previews catalog, start here with these 10 slides. We guarantee you’ll find something here that you need to check out, and it’ll give you plenty of time to let your local shop pre-order a copy with your name on it. \nSo what are you waiting for?
