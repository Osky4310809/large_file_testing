Votel, the head of US Central Command told the Wall Street Journal that more American troops would be needed to take Raqqa from IS. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has objected to US troops working with Kurdish troops to capture the city. At the moment, the Raqqa plan has been suspended, but it may be reinstated once the 30-day review is completed, which would not bode well for US-Turkey relations. \nDuring his trip, McCain met with Erdogan in Turkey’s capital to discuss the situation in Syria and current US-Turkey relations. \n“ The change of administration in the United States presents an important opportunity to review and reassess current policy in Syria, ” McCain said in a statement released Monday.
