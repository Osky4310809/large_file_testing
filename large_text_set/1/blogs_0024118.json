The show is a drama, through and through, with a murder mystery, relationships that will ebb and flow and present plenty of triangles (and maybe even some of more than just three people involved). But inside all the drama, there's a little fun, too, promises actress Marisol Nichols, who plays Hermione Lodge on the show. NEXT: Riverdale: Marisol Nichols Addresses Hermione Lodge's Surprise Baggage \n\"There's a lot of fun things, too. The majority of our show, especially for the adults, is dramatic,\" Nichols told Comicbook.com in an interview. She did tease a fun storyline or two for her character, though. \"There's a really fun storyline though that happens with ... you'll see it, with Hermione and Veronica, and you get to see the parenting skills and this relationship that these two have, which is really fun and cat-and-mouse.\" \nShe teased that relationship will really blossom and that storyline will debut about halfway through the season in episode six or seven, and promised \"it's fun.\" She also noted that her character gets to have a little bit of a different kind of fun with one Mr. Fred Andrews. \n\"Honestly, look, Luke Perry is my love interest - that's not not fun,\" she joked. She realizes she's living an 80s-90s dream right now. \"Dude, Skeet Ulrich is also on our show. I took this picture of me between Skeet and Luke and I was like, '90s Sandwich!' So fun, and then we had Molly Ringwald. I was like, 'Okay, this is kind of really, really cool.'\" \nThe relationship betwen Fred and Hermione will be explored in-depth, including their history in Riverdale. \n\"Fred Andrews in my mind was the love of her life, and who she should have been with and didn't. I'm sure we all had those what-if's. 'What if I would've stayed with so-and-so?' Or 'What if I would've gone down that path?'\" That relatability is something she really enjoys getting to hold onto with Hermione. \"Her life is pretty much in shambles when she comes. That 'what-if' presents itself for her, and she's not necessarily free to pursue it, but then again, she's not necessarily tied down to not pursue it, so that's going to come into play and haunt her.\" \nThe actress also teased there's another casting announcement she's excited about but literally couldn't say another word about that. It sounds like they'll be having some fun - even when their characters aren't having much fun - either way though. \nRiverdale airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on The CW.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T05:15:46.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
