Here, we’ve rounded up the 20 biggest and best documentaries to look out for this year. \nIn a world where Michael Bay movies are allowed to exist, it’s no surprise that sometimes, cinema-goers look to documentaries to give them something different – something real. As long as there are bombastic action flicks, visceral animated dreamscapes, cringe-inducing comedies and the rest, audiences will also yearn for the truth – or something close to it. \nLast year saw a slew of critically revered documentaries that delved into everything from political scandal, volcanoes, slavery, the global weapons trade, climate change and existential life stories from musical maestros. \nThis year, we’ve got an equally broad selection of far-reaching documentary topics, from both acclaimed and proficient masters of documentary-making and hopeful first-time newcomers, highlighting our ongoing commitment to the genre and pointing directly to our increased capacity to capture, reproduce and respect truth. \nSo, in honor of the genre, we’ve put together a small selection of 20 documentaries we think are worth keeping an eye on in 2017’s months to come… If you must procrastinate by watching a movie, do it proactively. 78/52 \nDirector: Alexandre O. Philippe Release Date: January 23 \nAn unprecedented look at the iconic shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho , the “man behind the curtain,” and the screen murder that profoundly changed the course of world cinema. Water & Power: A California Heist \nDirector: Marina Zenovich Release Date: January 23 \nThis doc uncovers the alarming exploits of California’s most notorious water barons, who profit off of the state’s resource while everyday citizens, unincorporated towns, and small farmers endure debilitating water crises. As the divide between water have and have-nots grows, we face a humbling reality: water is the new oil, and as it becomes less accessible, it is rapidly growing more valuable. This Is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous \nDirector: Barbara Kopple Release Date: February 3 \nAre there limits to your love for your family? One family’s acceptance is tested when a champion diver, destined for the Olympics, announces he’s transitioning into a woman – and invites his YouTube followers along for every moment. It’s a story about unconditional love and finding the courage to be yourself. Trumped: Inside the Greatest Political Upset of All Time \nDirectors: Ted Bourne, Mary Robertson, Banks Tarver Release Date: February 3 \nUnprecedented access and never-before-seen footage of candidate Trump, from the primaries through the debates to the dawning realization that the controversial businessman will become the 45th President of the United States. Awaiting Release Date Give Me Future: Major Lazer in Cuba \nDirector: Austin Peters \nIn the spring of 2016, global music sensation Major Lazer performed a free concert in Havana, Cuba – an unprecedented show that drew an audience of almost half a million. This concert documentary evolves into an exploration of youth culture in a country on the precipice of change. Cries from Syria \nDirector: Evgeny Afineevsky \nThis documentary focuses on child protesters, revolution icons, activists and their relatives, and high-ranking Army generals who defected to join the fight of the people. It tells the story of the Syrian people who have never lost hope, taking the audience on a unique journey in time, from Syria to Turkey, through Jordan, Lebanon and Europe. Rock and a Hard Place \nDirectors: Jon Alpert, Matthew O’Neill \nInspired by Dwayne Johnson’s own experiences with the law as a youth, HBO documentary Rock and a Hard Place captures the lives of incarcerated young people who are granted a second chance through a one-of-a-kind boot camp program. 40 Years of Rocky: The Birth of a Classic \nDirector: Derek Wayne Johnson \nSylvester Stallone and John G. Avildsen narrate behind-the-scenes footage from the making of Rocky to mark the film’s 40th anniversary. Sylvia & Marsha \nDirector: David France \nAddressing the violence against transwomen of color, both today and historically, this documentary from France – the man behind Oscar-nominated flick How to Survive a Plague – is an investigation into the death of legendary trans-rights activist Marsha Johnson and sheds light on how she, along with fellow activist Sylvia Rivera, launched the transgender rights movement. City of Ghosts \nDirector: Matthew Heineman \nHeineman’s previous credits include the Academy Award-nominated Cartel Land , which followed the vigilantes on both sides of the US-Mexico border trying to end the drug wars and questioning the ethics of the self-proclaimed police forces. It was well worth our time. \nHis new documentary is the story of a new type of warfare: It follows the journey of a handful of anonymous activists who banded together after their homeland was taken over by ISIS in 2014. Tell Them We Are Rising: The Story of Black Colleges and Universities \nDirector: Stanley Nelson \nA haven for black intellectuals, artists and revolutionaries – and path of promise toward the American dream – Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have educated the architects of freedom movements and cultivated leaders in every field. They have been unapologetically Black for 150 years. For the first time ever, their story is told. Casting JonBenet \nDirector: Kitty Green \nThe unsolved death of six-year-old American beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey remains the world’s most sensational child murder case. Over 15 months, responses, reflections and performances were elicited from the Ramsey’s Colorado hometown community, creating a bold work of art from the collective memories and mythologies the crime inspired. Rancher, Farmer, Fisherman \nDirectors: Susan Froemke, John Hoffman, Beth Aala \nOut on America’s vast working landscapes – the ranches of the Mountain west, the farmlands of the Great Plains, the waterways of the Mississippi Delta – a huge, largely hidden, and entirely unexpected movement is being born. \nTens of thousands of heartland conservationists are leading some of the most consequential work in the nation to restore America’s forests, grasslands, wildlife, soil and fisheries: the vast, rich bounty that shaped our national character and sustains our way of life. Legion Of Brothers \nDirector: Greg Barker \nAfghanistan, immediately post-9/11: Small teams of Green Berets arrive on a series of secret missions to overthrow the Taliban. What happens next is equal parts war origin story and cautionary tale, illuminating the nature and impact of 15 years of constant combat, with unprecedented access to U.S. Special Forces. 500 Years \nDirector: Pamela Yates \nFrom a historic genocide trial to the overthrow of a president, the sweeping story of mounting resistance played out in Guatemala’s recent history is told through the actions and perspectives of the majority indigenous Mayan population, who now stand poised to reimagine their society. Ex Libris: New York Public Library \nDirector: Frederick Wiseman \nAcclaimed documentarian Wiseman, known for his doc portraits of major institutions, such as National Gallery, received a grant from Sundance to make Ex Libris: New York Public Library , about the City of New York’s vast and complex library system. Nobody Speak: Hulk Hogan, Gawker and Trials of a Free Press \nDirector: Brian Knappenberger \nAfter We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists and The Internet’s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz , Knappenberger is the person we most want making documentaries on internet-related subject matter. \nThe trial between Hulk Hogan and Gawker Media pitted privacy rights against freedom of the press, and raised important questions about how big money can silence media. This film is an examination of the perils and duties of the free press in an age of inequality. Untitled Joshua Oppenheimer Project \nDirector: Joshua Oppenheimer \nJoshua Oppenheimer’s surreal and shocking, award-winning 2012 film The Act of Killing was unlike anything we had ever seen before – an absurd and frightening glimpse into a period of Indonesian history that had still not been condemned by its own country. \nHis 2014 follow-up, The Look of Silence , used a blunter, equally brilliant approach for a more unsettling portrait of the genocide, considering not just what is remembered, but how we change when it is forgotten; a smart companion piece to Oppenheimer’s earlier entry. \nSo, although we have zero details about Oppenheimer’s next documentary project other than it is happening, we’ve reserved a special space on this list for it. \nNow that you’re up to date on the biggest documentaries coming in 2017, check out the 40 best movies arriving this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T19:09:43.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
