The Rock ‘n’ Roll Express featured wrestlers Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson who made their debut in \nIt’s been a long road back to the WWE for Angle who left the company in 2006 after becoming addicted to painkillers. Kurt told Forbes in a recent interview that Vince McMahon wanted him to check into rehab, but Angle declined and the two sides decided to part ways despite a number of years remaining on his contract. \n— pwstream (@pwstream) February 12, 2017 \n“Vince wanted me to take care of myself, he did want me to check into rehab, and I didn’t listen to him,” Angle said. “I wish I would have. But I went to another company and spent 11 years there so it’s just nice for Vince McMahon and Triple H to call me and tell me they want to induct me, and they want me to be somewhat a part of the company.” \nAngle has used his experience in overcoming addiction to launch an app called, Anglestrong. According to the official website , the app features check-ins, lifelines, reminders, forums, support, links, monthly support conference call with Kurt Angle, and is available 24/7 365 days a year. \nIn addition to his work helping people fight addiction, Angle told Forbes that he would love to become a trainer for NXT sometime down the road as opposed to opening his own wrestling school as former WWE stars like the Dudley Boyz and Lance Storm have done. \n“I have a lot to offer in professional wrestling and I really love the sport, I love sports entertainment. It’s been really good to me. I caught on very quickly and I’ve been a great student, now I’ve become a great teacher.” \nNot only does Kurt Angle want to help people with addiction and become a trainer, but he also believes that there’s still more to come in his wrestling career. Angle said in the interview that as of right now, the focus is just on the Hall of Fame induction, but that he believes the WWE will ask him to do some matches down the road. \nWhen asked who he’d like to get in the ring with, Kurt didn’t hesitate. \n“I’ve had my best matches with AJ [Styles] and [Samoa] Joe, so it’d be nice to do it on a bigger platform in the WWE so we’ll see what happens.” \nAJ Styles Wants To Face Kurt Angle In WWE, Speaks On Working With Cena https://t.co/Qx5MNSaQ8e pic.twitter.com/mDooJzqZkD \n— WreactDown (@WreactDown) January 28, 2017 \nAngle elaborated more on facing AJ Styles one more time in an interview back in January with former WWE ring announcer Lillian Garcia on her show, Making Their Way To The Ring , and Kurt compared Styles to WWE legend Shawn Michaels . \n“I wrestled AJ in TNA, and I can tell you that he is every bit as good as Shawn Michaels.
