Rosado-designed stunner from her billionaire beau. \"It's an epic ring for an epic time in her life,\" the designer told Vogue in January. (By their November split, it was also at the center of one very important controversy: Would she get to keep the ring ?) 33 of 54 Jodie Sweetin/Instagram; Inset: WireImage JODIE SWEETIN & JUSTIN HODAK \n“I'm so happy and he did a GREAT job with the ring!” the Fuller House star wrote on Instagram of her double halo-set, split-shank ring. 34 of 54 TC/Splash News Online LOUISE ROE & MACKENZIE HUNKIN \nThe style star got a classic-with-a-twist sparkler from her TV director love – an oval diamond with two halos of smaller diamonds, all set in yellow gold. 35 of 54 Startraks; Inset: Courtesy Neil Lane ROSIE HUNTINGTON-WHITELEY & JASON STATHAM \n“ Jason wanted something perfect and flawless and he kept coming back to this one,” Neil Lane tells People of the Edwardian-set stone from the jeweler's archival collection that the action star gave his supermodel bride-to-be. 36 of 54 D Dipasupil/Getty; Inset: AKM-GSI EVA LONGORIA & JOSE ANTONIO BASTON \nThe bride-to-be looked ecstatic to show off her ruby-and-diamond sparkler from her TV exec boyfriend on The Today Show – even more so because she chose a pair of ruby-and-diamond earrings to match! 37 of 54 Seth Browarnik/Startraks; Inset:Neil Lane RYAN PHILLIPPE & PAULINA SLAGTER \nThe actor and his Stanford law student girlfriend made sure to ring in the new year with this Neil Lane stunner , consisting of 185 round diamonds. 38 of 54 Skylar Astin/Instagram ANNA CAMP & SKYLAR AUSTIN \nWhen the two stars of your favorite acapella movie decided to get hitched , you just knew the ring was going to be (wait for it) Pitch Perfect. 39 of 54 Source: Tory Burch Instagram TORY BURCH & PIERRE-YVES ROSSEL \nThe fashion designer's ring from her french fashion exec beau can probably be seen from outer space. 40 of 54 Keisha Knight Pullman/Instagram \nKESHIA KNIGHT PULLIAM & ED HARTWELL \nThe Cosby Show's massive square-cut rock from the former NFL player is just one of the reasons she declared herself #blessedbeyondmeasure at Christmas 2015.
