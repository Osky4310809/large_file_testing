Why the launch of the MCL32 is set to look like a case of back to the future for the Formula 1 superpower; Watch live on Sky Sports from 11am on Friday By Pete Gill   12:39pm A case of back to the future for McLaren in 2016? It's a question which has been burning with a reddish hue all winter: do McLaren believe their future looks orange? \nChange has certainly become endemic at McLaren in recent months. They have changed driver line-up. They have changed boss (and not once but twice with both Ron Dennis and Jost Capito departing). They have changed fuel supplier. They have changed their name of their car, sidestepping recent tradition and the 'MP4' naming scheme and designating their 2017 contender as the 'MCL32' instead. \nBut ahead of Friday's unveiling of the MCL32, which will be streamed live on Sky F1's Digital platforms and broadcast live on Sky Sports News HQ , there is only one question being asked by fans: will the new car be painted orange? \nWhat's in a colour? For the last couple of decades, McLaren's cars have been predominantly liveried silver, a look which was originally triggered by a sponsorship deal with cigarette makers West which abruptly brushed over McLaren's 'classic' red and white paint job (which itself was a result of a sponsorship deal with Marlboro). \nMcLaren have not commented on the speculation. But the change would fit with the appointment of marketing guru Zak Brown as executive director following Dennis' ousting and the team have been responsible for a series of clues apparently pointing to an imminent radical change of livery. \nFirst, note, the eye-catching orange streak in McLaren's announcement for the MCL32's launch... February can only mean one thing... #ChangeYourGame pic.twitter.com/wHN5gLtHRr \nAnd then there was this post. The orange-coloured car might have been in the background but its impact on social media was very much to the forefront... Loving the kaleidoscope of McLarens in the heritage bays this morning. #MTCSnaps pic.twitter.com/iMRSmwJ8FP — McLaren (@McLarenF1) January 27, 2017 \nStill not convinced? Well perhaps the most compelling clue was the font of McLaren's countdown to the MCL32's big reveal. The clock is ticking… and the countdown to our 2017 car launch on Friday February 24th begins. pic.twitter.com/5qNSqfVLtw — McLaren (@McLarenF1) January 16, 2017 \nSo why orange? The mistake would be to think of an orange livery as a radical departure from the team's history. \nIn fact, orange - and not the silver tint of recent years or the Marlboro-themed iconic red and white livery of the Prost-Senna era - should be considered McLaren's original colour. \nAlthough a sponsorship deal meant the team's first-ever F1 car, the M2B, was painted white with a green stripe, orange was the colour of choice for founder Bruce McLaren and McLaren's first F1 victory was achieved in 1968 in a M7A car sporting a distinctive orange livery. \nMcLaren's colour scheme then remained largely unchanged until the 1970s when sponsorship deals with Yardley and Marlboro inspired fresh looks - including the red and white widely perceived, erroneously, to be McLaren's 'traditional' livery. \nAn orange liveried-McLaren has even sporadically appeared during testing in recent memory. \nHere's the MP4-20 in the winter of 2006 with Pedro de la Rosa behind the wheel of the orange-painted McLaren \nAnd back in 1997, here's another orange-coloured McLaren with two-time world champion Mika Hakkinen giving it a whirl. \nA case of back to the future on Friday then? McLaren's future could be bright, the future could be orange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:28:18.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
