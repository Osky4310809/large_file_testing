We acknowledge the cordial relationship between the President of Republic of Niger and Nigeria, hence the need for us to come to the party to strengthen the relationship.” \nWe believe that the cordial executive relationship between the two countries should be replicated at Party level. \n“It is line with this understanding that the two leaders (Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigerien President Mahamadou Issoufou) agreed to channel crude oil from Republic of Niger to the Kaduna refinery for refining. We have had discussion with the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Mr. Maikanti Baru to facilitate the plan. \n“The project is unprecedented because in Africa we are used to exporting crude oil instead of refining it within the continent. This is the first time two countries are coming together for this sort of bilateral crude-refining arrangement.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:24:54.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
