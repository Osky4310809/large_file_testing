Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that only about one-third of the attendees of her most recent town hall event were actually constituents of hers, claiming the others were from outside the district and perhaps even from out of state. (Many Republicans have claimed that town halls are being filled with paid protesters organized by liberal activists .) . @MarshaBlackburn : We know there's organizing going on from the left. Less than a third were my constituents https://t.co/crCrYn9ltK \n— Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) February 23, 2017 \nDuring an interview this afternoon, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer relentlessly grilled the Tennessee lawmaker on her claims and pressed her to provide proof and evidence to back up her assertion, all while providing additional sources that contradicted her. \nAfter Blitzer began the conversation by asking her if she had any evidence to support her comments, Blackburn stated that she had talked to people estimating the crowds and that is what they thought. The CNN anchor responded by bringing up a tweet from the New York Times’ Trip Gabriel , who was at the event. Everyone I spoke to in this town hall identified themselves as TN-7 voter. Town restricted RSVP's to locals and checked ID's. https://t.co/4xLVn2qeOH \n— Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) February 23, 2017 \n“You know, Wolf, there were some people who stood up to speak and ask a question and they identified themselves as living outside of the district,” the GOP rep responded. “So, I don’t know who the reporter talked to.” \nBlackburn further noted that some of those who RSVP’d to the town hall didn’t put down their information, even though it was pointed out that they had to be residents of the district. \n“Hold on one second, Congresswoman, because there is some video that is now out there on social media,” Blitzer replied. “I’m going to play it for you and then we’ll continue this. Watch this.” \nAfter showing Blackburn a video from the meeting showing nearly all of the attendees raising their hands when asked who lived in the district, Blitzer asked the congresswoman, “How do you know only a third of the people who were inside actually were from your district?” \nFor the next couple of minutes, the two would go back and forth over the subject, with Blitzer highlighting the fact that they were checking IDs at the door and were told they needed to live in the district, and Blackburn saying that out-of-state license plates were seen in the parking lot folks were heard in line stating they didn’t live there. She also complained that Blitzer was “hung up on percentages,” with the CNN anchor shooting back that she was the one who made the claim in the first place. \nWatch the clip above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:50:51.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
