The ladies, sit down,\" Winston reportedly said . \"But all my boys, stand up. We strong, right? We strong! We strong, right? All my boys, tell me one time: I can do anything I put my mind to. Now a lot of boys aren't supposed to be soft-spoken. You know what I'm saying? One day y'all are going to have a very deep voice like this (in deep voice). One day, you'll have a very, very deep voice. \"But the ladies, they're supposed to be silent, polite, gentle. My men, my men (are) supposed to be strong. I want y'all to tell me what the third rule of life is: I can do anything I put my mind to. Scream it!\" Probably not the best message to send. Winston's controversial past, which includes accusations of rape by a fellow student while at Florida State, only added fuel to the controversy. \nJameis Winston meant to only say girls should be quiet when it comes to reporting rape — Maddy Dowling (@maddy_dowling33) February 23, 2017 \nTurns out Jameis Winston has some backwards views on women. Which I pretty much already gathered from the fact that he's a rapist. — Eric Pines @Hyrule (@SirAceOfPlaces) February 23, 2017 \nNot very smart choice of words for Jameis Winston especially after being accused of rape a few years ago... https://t.co/uxRRGYIB6F — RJ Glosson (@RJthaDon89) February 23, 2017 \nWHY WHY WHY WOULD YOU EVER have Jameis Winston speak 2 children, state of Florida? You sheltered him from rape charges; be happy he got off. — PNW Wonder Woman (@StephHartford) February 23, 2017 \nJameis Winston, NFL Star Once Accused Of Rape, Tells Young Girls To Be ‘Silent & Gentle’ https://t.co/uEkaULIFy6 — Enoch Jeremiah (@EnochJeremiah7) February 23, 2017 \nI'm not surprised Jameis Winston wants woman to be silent. He was accused of rape. — Lea Ware (@leaware123) February 23, 2017 \nJameis saying girls are supposed to be silent & polite while boys are supposed to be strong sure says a lot after the rape accusations  — laura  (@TheLaura_Lou) February 23, 2017 Unsurprisingly, Winston sent an apology to ESPN shortly after. \"I was making an effort to interact with a young male in the audience who didn't seem to be paying attention, and I didn't want to single him out so I asked all the boys to stand up,\" Winston said. \"During my talk, I used a poor word choice that may have overshadowed that positive message for some.\" Video of the speech is available at the Tampa Bay Times website.
