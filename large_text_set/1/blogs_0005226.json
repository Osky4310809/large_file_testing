These traditions were passed on throughout the long ages from house to house of the High Elves. [1] \nMelian , the Queen of Doriath , was the Maia who originally held this recipe. Later, it was passed to Galadriel and other Elves. \nGaladriel gave a large store of it to the Fellowship of the Ring upon its departure from Lothlórien . One of the elves commented \"[...] we call it lembas or waybread, and it is more strengthening than any food by men, and it is more pleasant than cram , by all accounts.\" [2] Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee subsisted on it through the majority of their journey from the Anduin River to Mordor . Description Edit \nThe bread was very nutritious, stayed fresh for months when wrapped in mallorn leaves, and was used for sustenance on long journeys. Lembas was light brown on the outside, and the color of cream on the inside. It was made of meal that was baked thin and crisp. Gimli thought it was Cram until he tasted it and found that it was sweet and pleasant, unlike Cram. [2] It is also described as a wafer. [3] \nThough the grain used to make Lembas is called corn it is most likely similar to wheat. In early UK history, \"corn\" was not specific to maize. [4] Since Tolkien wrote \"Of Lembas\" around the mid 1900's he most likely understood corn to mean grain. \nThe recipe of lembas was a closely guarded secret, and only on rare occasions was it given to non-elves. [1] Like other products of the Elves, it was offensive to creatures corrupted by evil; Gollum refused outright to eat it. [5] \nDuring the First Age, lembas was wrapped in \"leaves of silver [...] a wafer of white wax shaped as a single flower of Telperion .\" [1] Etymology \nLembas is Sindarin for \"Waybread\", from the older form lenn-mbass (\"journey bread\"). In Quenya , it is called Coimas (\"life-bread\").
