It’s a very, very bad blow for Seamus Coleman,” Kenny said. \n“I hope the surgeons can mend that in a way that he can continue to play again, which is obviously a great challenge for him. \n“It’s not usual to find that level of ferocity in tackles in the beautiful game these days, so good luck to Seamus in his recovery.” \nA statement released by the Irish FA confirmed that surgeons have operated on the right-back, who faces a long spell on the sidelines. \nRUMOURS: Barca open Coutinho talks \n\"Seamus suffered a serious leg injury and has undergone surgery. He has had an exceptional season with both club and country, and he will be a big loss,\" Ireland head coach Martin O'Neill was quoted as saying. \n\"But Seamus is so mentally strong that when he has fully recovered he will be as brilliant as before.\" \nIreland are level with Serbia at the top of World Cup qualifying Group D with 11 points after five games. O'Neill's side take on Iceland in a friendly on Tuesday. Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T21:04:19.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
