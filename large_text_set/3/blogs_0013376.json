While addressing the media ahead of the Ranchi test, Virat said, “It is better if we move from it, in the past instances such as this has been stretched too long.

It’s time we focused on the remainder of the series. There’s a lot of cricket to be played and it should not happen in bad taste. What’s happened in Bengaluru happened in Bengaluru, we are in Ranchi and we should look forward to tomorrow,” Kohli said reestablishing the fact that cricket should stick to field. The 28-year-old batsman who has had an average series so far said, “Both teams have moved ahead from Bengaluru. I think the focus should get back on the series because the priority is here cricket.

I would have done few things right in my career to be given the opportunity to captain the side. As long as you’re honest and you work hard, you are answerable to no one. Everyone has their own opinion. I’m not challenging anyone. It’s totally up to them if someone challenges me. I am not going to hold a banner saying don’t speak ill about me. It’s all part of a whole journey,” he concluded.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:10:53.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
