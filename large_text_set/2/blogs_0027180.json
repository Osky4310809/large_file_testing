Where birds are being kept inside, we have advised retailers that products must be clearly labelled so shoppers can make an informed choice.\n‘After February 28, under current proposals, the majority of producers in England will be able to let birds outside provided they observe strict disease prevention measures, and we do not anticipate significant disruption to the supply of free-range eggs. Producers in the higher risk areas could still market their eggs as free range, provided they use netting and meet other free range criteria.’\nThe British Egg Industry Council (BEIC), which represents more than 95% of UK free-range egg production, said that although some free-range hens will be allowed back outside this week, some farmers will choose to temporarily keep their hens housed to protect them from the continued risk of avian influenza.\nIt said all members’ free-range egg packs will temporarily carry stickers from tomorrow, informing consumers that the eggs have been laid by hens currently kept in barns, to create a level playing field for producers.\nThere will also be signs near where eggs are sold highlighting this and the freerangeinfo.com website has been set up.\nBEIC chief executive Mark Williams said: ‘The need to change labelling of free-range egg packs after 12 weeks is an EU requirement. However, these are all still free-range hens but some are temporarily housed to protect them from bird flu.\n‘Free range producers still incur the same costs for land and staff while birds are housed, and in many cases are facing increased costs for additional biosecurity.\n‘We need to avoid a potential ‘postcode lottery’ whereby individual farmers could be penalised if they have chosen to temporarily continue to keep their hens inside.\n‘Therefore all of our members, supported by retailers, have taken the decision to label all free-range eggs, to help protect the future of the British free range sector.’\nHe added: ‘Our research shows that consumers are supportive of farmers putting birds’ health first and 80% are happy to continue to pay the same price, or more, for eggs from free-range flocks temporarily housed inside.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:23:08.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
