(Quinones tweeted about “Formation” when revealing the cover.) It features Chavez in a hat, dress, accessories, and a sneer that invoke Beyoncé in all of her Lemonade glory .\nChavez is a fairly new addition to the Marvel family, first appearing in Young Avengers in 2011 before getting her own eponymous series this year penned by Gabby Rivera .\n(Credit: Joe Quinones/Marvel)  \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:55:35.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
