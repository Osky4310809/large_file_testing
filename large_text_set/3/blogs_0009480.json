Ignatius Patrimonio, was in Moscow from Feb. 27 to March 11. \n“This training in Russia is a historic first for the PSG and augurs very well for Philippines-Russia relations. This is a manifestation of the growing trust and confidence between the two sides, which, in turn, generates positive momentum for deeper cooperation in the field of security and other areas of mutual interest,” Ambassador to Russia Carlos Sorreta said. \nThe capacity-building activity is one of the concrete results of the successful visit to the Philippines of Nikolay Patrushev, chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, last month. Patrushev met with President Duterte, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr. in Davao City to discuss a wide range of bilateral matters, including defense and security cooperation. \nDuring the meeting, Patrushev offered the Philippines access to an intelligence database to help it fight crime and militancy, and training for the elite forces assigned to protect Duterte.
