It's the same overall design as the regular controller. But it's just ... well, better .\nEverything has been upgraded. The thumbsticks are removable, as is the D-pad, and they can be replaced with different options depending on your preferences for the games you play. There are four additional paddles on the back, configurable firing mechanisms, and custom button mapping with the Xbox Accessories app for Xbox One and Windows 10.\nThe materials are as close to wear-resistant as Microsoft can get, and once you hold one next to a regular controller, the differences are clear â€” and astounding.
