And while back in November, some analysts predicted sales three times their actual amounts — three million as opposed to the approximately one million altogether — demand is still higher than availability, and will continue to be for some time.\nGoogle reportedly spent more than twice its average TV budget — over $100 million — to promote the Pixel, with Verizon following with more than $50 million to grow awareness of the new brand for its stores.\nGiven that the Pixel is a high-end phone with the same starting $649 price tag of the Galaxy S7, it's clear that Google is on to something, and will continue to reap the benefits of an ad campaign well run — even as it struggles to fill demand on the supply side.\nGoogle Pixel + Pixel XL Google Pixel and Pixel XL review Google Pixel XL review: A U.S. perspective Google Pixel FAQ: Should you upgrade?
