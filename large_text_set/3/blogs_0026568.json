Toby Alderweireld celebrates after scoring against Monaco at Wembley \nWembley can allow five more major sporting events within its current cap so Spurs are asking for an additional 22 to make 27 overall. \nThey initially asked for a total of 36 games at the national stadium's maximum capacity of 90,000, in order to cover the highest number of home matches the club could feasibly play in all competitions next season. \nBut the proposal was considered too great a strain on local residents, with Brent Council instead suggesting a compromise option of all 36 matches but at a reduced capacity of 61,000, the same figure the new White Hart Lane will hold. Fans arrive at the ground prior to the Champions League match between Tottenham and Monaco \nTottenham have not budged on the maximum attendance, however, and their latest proposal requests the 90,000 capacity but for only 27 fixtures. \nAny more matches would then in theory have to fall in line with Wembley's current regulations, which state additional events can only be open to the lower and middle tiers, amounting to an attendance of 50,835.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T10:00:48.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
