Two senior Ukip party members from Merseyside have resigned from the party because of Nuttall’s conduct in relation to Hillsborough, and his admission that the claim that he lost close friends in the tragedy were false. One of them, Ukip’s chairman in Liverpool, has questioned whether Nuttall is fit to lead the party. norman smith (@BBCNormanS) February 20, 2017 norman smith (@BBCNormanS) Sources in @ukip say more resignations of party officials and members expected in Merseyside over @paulnuttallukip Hillsborough comments \nI will post more on this as further details become available. \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n11am: Number 10 lobby briefing. \n3pm: Peers begin the two-day second reading debate on the article 50 bill. \n4.30pm: MPs hold a debate in Westminster Hall on the petition saying Donald Trump should not be invited to make a state visit to the UK. \nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:53:15.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
