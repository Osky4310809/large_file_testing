Chelsea need fresh legs in defence with John Terry expected to leave this summer (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nPep Guardiola's Mancunian Blues are desperate to strengthen their defence and Van Dijk has become the hottest property in the Premier League. \nSouthampton, who sold then-skipper and his fellow centre-back Jose Fonte to West Ham in January, have publicly insisted they will not sell the 25-year-old this summer - but, realistically, they face a losing battle. \nThey know they are in for yet another struggle to keep one of their prize assets, having seen the big-money departures of players including Fonte, Adam Lallana, Sadio Mane, Luke Shaw, Morgan Schneiderlin, Dejan Lovren, Nathaniel Clyne, Victor Wanyama and Calum Chambers in recent windows. \nChelsea will have to pay big money but Antonio Conte has been promised major funds as he prepares for their return to the Champions League, and central defence is one of the areas he is targeting.
