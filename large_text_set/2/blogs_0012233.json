Manafort, who has done business in Russia, dismissed the accounts of the officials on Tuesday. \nWhile it's not unusual for U.S. businessmen to come in contact with foreign intelligence authorities, law enforcement officials did not say to what extent these conversations may have been about business. \nRelated: Meet Trump's Newest 'Alternative Facts' Guy, Stephen Miller! \nOfficials would also not go into detail about what was discussed on the calls, which Russian intelligence officials were contacted, how many of Trump's advisers were involved, and whether the conversations had anything to do with the big boss himself. \nBut based on other reports from intelligence officials, we can piece together a very believable puzzle that Russia has been puppeteering President Pinocchio's moves for quite some time now . \nWhat do U think all this correspondence between Trump's campaign and Russian intelligence was about?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T17:44:46.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
