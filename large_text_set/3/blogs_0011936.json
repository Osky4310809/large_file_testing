Fortunately, for the sake of others and their rights, Snowden has gained the attention of the masses, giving a voice to whistleblowers before him who were largely ignored or ridiculed. You have to understand, it’s very difficult for people to share information that threatens the control structure of the elite. They risk their lives doing what they do.\nSnowden revealed that your entire life has been tracked, stored, and recorded using multiple techniques. No conversation goes unheard, and virtually no action goes unseen. He told the world that a “super national intelligence organization” known as the “five eyes” is behind it all, and can do whatever it wants. He also told the world that organizations like these operate far beyond the laws of their own countries.\nHe also revealed some of the aftermath of World War II:\nThe Five Eyes alliance is sort of an artifact of the post World War II era where the Anglophone countries are the major powers banded together to sort of cooperate and share the costs of intelligence gathering infrastructure. So we have the UK’s GCHQ, we have the US NSA, we have Canada’s CSEC, we have the Australian Signals Intelligence Directorate, and we have New Zealand’s DSD. What the result of this was over decades and decades was sort of a supra-national intelligence organisation that doesn’t answer to the laws of its own countries.\nThe fact that they are above the law has been mentioned by numerous insiders over the decades. For example, the highest ever ranking Asian American politician, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, revealed that “there exists a shadowy government with its own air force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism and the ability to pursue its own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances.”\nHe’s not the only one, and you can view some similar quotes in an article we published about the “secret government” here .\nWhy Is Snowden a Great Example of a Real Patriot? Known as “the father of public relations,” Edward Bernays once said:\nThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are moulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. \nThis quote comes from his book Propaganda, which was written in 1928, and unfortunately, not much has changed since its publication. Society has been being brainwashed for a long time, and have been made to believe that certain truths are simply conspiracy theories.\nThe greatest example of this is Edward Snowden’s leaks about mass surveillance. But we already know there are multiple secretive programs running and information that has yet to see the light of day, which begs the question, how is the world going to react when they find out the truth of much more sensitive and secretive information?\nThese programs lie within the black budget world, and are known as Unacknowledged Special Access Programs. You can read more about black budget programs in more detail here . Please keep in mind that surveillance is one out of many programs operating without any Congressional oversight.\nSnowden is a patriot because he believes in information transparency. While some argue surveillance programs are needed to protect national security and to ensure public safety, Snowden and others have stated over and over again that mass surveillance does neither, and, what’s worse, takes away our rights as citizens.\nJFK said it best:\nThe very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. . . . And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. . . .\nWe are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence–on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.\nIts preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.\n‘National Security’ Is a Joke, and Purposely Maintained to Justify Unethical Government Behaviour It’s still difficult to understand the justification of mass surveillance beamed out into the mainstream, and according to many, there is none. Instead, we seem to have a group of global elite that, as JFK emphasizes above, want to capitalize on and announce the need for security in order to “expand its meaning to the very limits of censorship and concealment.”\nFor example, the biggest justification for surveillance and the secrecy of these programs is the threat of terrorism, and events like 9/11, but how can the United States justify these programs using threats that they themselves create?\nIt wasn’t long ago that the Pentagon was ousted for paying a PR firm over $500 million to create fake terrorist videos. (You can read more about that here .) This issue was also brought up at the International Conference on the New World Order, where evidence for this belief was presented by multiple people. You can read more about that conference, and false flag terrorism in general, here .\n“Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We’ve become a lunatic asylum.” \n– David Steele, a 20-year Marine Corps intelligence officer, and the second-highest-ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence ( source )\nHere is a great video of award winning American journalist Ben Swann, who works to expose things like this. This phenomenon is called “ false flag terrorism .” 9/11 is the perfect example, as there are now published studies in reputable peer-reviewed physics and engineering journals detailing how it was an inside job. You can access some of those and read more about it in this article: “ Physicists & Engineers Publish Another 9/11 Study: All Three Buildings Were ‘Destroyed By Controlled Demolition.’ “ Modern Day Patriotism Is Really the Exact Opposite It’s a wonderful thing to support your country, but true patriotism bears little resemblance to the patriotism encouraged by the media. It’s not joining the military and fighting for your country, since you’re not really fighting for your country going after a “terrorist threat.” You’re actually fighting for corporations and a group of global elite, who, as Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the 13th annual meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club, use “imaginary” (like false flag terrorism) and mythical threats to enforce their ideas on others. You’re fighting for their interests, and it doesn’t seem like they have the best interests of the people in mind.\nHere is a great quote that echoes this sentiment:\n“The statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.” \n– Mark Twain ( source )\nWe are conditioned and made to believe that military service is something to be proud of. While these men and women may enlist in order to serve their country, with a tremendous amount of bravery and good intentions going into that decision, that does not mean their good intent is being directed to good aims.\nTrue patriotism requires us to detach from all of the brainwashing we experience on a daily basis and recognize that the government is not free from fault. Public scrutiny and participation in politics is one of the necessary checks and balances for true democracy. But sometimes it’s hard to accept the truth about something we care for so much, and for some people, it’s their country.\nAt the end of the day these are nothing but invisible lines.\n“Being patriotic doesn’t mean simply agreeing with your government. Supporting your government, attempting to defend their values, doesn’t mean simply saying yes, okay, whatever you say. In fact, I would argue that being willing to disagree, particularly in a risky manner, is actually what we need more of today. When we have this incredible, often fact-free environment, where politicians can simply make a claim and then it’s reported, without actual critical analysis of what that means or what that effect would be, how do we actually steer democracy, how do we actually guide the boat. But if we have facts, and if we have people who have actually worked with these capabilities who are also participating in their democracy, maybe we can do a little bit better here. I am one of the only people who have worked with these mass surveillance programs directly who is able to comment on these openly. Everyone else in the United States, for one reason or another, has their speech chilled either by fear of prosecution,which would be the vast majority of individuals, or because they want to comment anonymously to journalists or whatever.” ( source )\nReal patriotism involves critical thinking and constant questioning, not blind trust. Unfortunately, we now live in a world of mass propaganda and brainwashing, making it difficult to discern truth from lies. The first step is looking at multiple sources, and this can be hard, because our perception of most of the important events that happen on our planet is controlled by a handful of corporations who control mainstream media.\nWe’ve Clearly Experienced a Shift in Consciousness That being said, we’ve clearly already experienced a shift in consciousness, and that shift is ongoing. By this I mean that the way we perceive our world and what we regard as truth is changing. This was made even more evident by the fact that mainstream media labelled almost all other independent media as “ fake news .”\nThe world’s eyes have shifted from mainstream media to alternative media; the world has lost faith in mainstream media and is starting to look for new sources. As a collective, we are actually starting to see through the veil that’s been blinding the masses for so long, and that’s a very encouraging thought.\nIt’s definitely an exciting time to be alive right now. Don’t you think?\n \n \n \n \n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:03:55.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
