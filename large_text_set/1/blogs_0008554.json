Let’s see if this worn-in classic has a price that you could love as well.\nAdvertisement \n\nSo it turns out that junkyards are NOT the ticket to getting a killer deal on a used Ferrari. Who knew? Well to be honest, several of you did point to a number of recent auctions where cars like yesterday’s junkyard-located 1978 Ferrari 308GTS went for far less than the parts puller was asking. The end result on that car was a 62% Crack Pipe loss, and relatedly an itch to start following BaT auctions.\n\nBMW’s Ur M3 was perhaps the least capable of any of the cars to carry that badge outside of those also branded “Tomica,” but it certainly was the most iconic. Unlike later editions that were hard for the layman to visually differentiate from a standard 3-series, the E30 M3, with its severely creased fender flares and oddly amazing boot lid and back window extender is immediately identifiable as something special.\nAdvertisement \n\nHere we have a 1990 M3 in Diamondschwarz over black leather and while it still maintains that unique visual flair, its history of four owners and nearly 200K on the clock are also prominently on display.\n\nThe seller says that this was once a mid-west car, having done time in both Chicago and Indiana, so perhaps it’s not as bad as it could be. It’s now enjoying the more moderate climes in Southern California, but still has some battle scars to show for its past life.\nIs it terrible? Probably not. The ad notes that there is some rust here and there, but it doesn’t seem to be outwardly visible outside of the bubbles on the hood. Other aesthetic issues include peppering on the nose from highway driving, chipping on the trailing edge of the doors, and stress cracking in the top of the rear wing. Let’s just go ahead and say that the car needs a respray and a little more. \n\nHead inside and you find much the same condition. The A-pillar covers are warped from heat cycling and there’s a crack in the dash top. The seats show crazing in the leather, split seams in the back, and a hole in the passenger backrest. Then there’s the weird twisted pair of wires hanging out of the dash left of the Momo steering wheel. What’s that all about?\n\nThe ad says that the engine “runs smooth and strong” and has good compression in all four pots. A new alternator and battery were added just within the past 100 miles, which is good. Also new are the front tires, oil and filter, and the window switches. Aftermarket BBS wheels underpin the car but the seller says he has a set of 16-inch wheels as well, but doesn’t note what exactly those are.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T16:28:10.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
