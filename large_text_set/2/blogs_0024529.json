He talked to his council colleagues about the idea -- which has been pushed by police and fire associations -- Wednesday during a closed-doors legal session. Potential Dallas police and fire pension fix emerging in Texas Legislature \nGriggs' aim is to ask voters in November to make the choice between using money for DART's future or for public safety workers' retirements. \nDART, of course, never thought it would be part of the pension mess. Agency spokesman Morgan Lyons said such a move is \"potentially devastating for transit operations.\" \nLyons said DART officials would have to consider cuts to train and bus service and perhaps even reconsider their ambitions to simultaneously build a second downtown Dallas rail line, a streetcar and a new suburban rail line to D/FW International Airport. \nBut for the pension system, the money would be a significant boon. The ailing fund, which is on track for insolvency in 10 years, would be in line to get at least $30 million annually. Dallas and Houston both have pension problems, but Houston is actually solving theirs \nDallas taxpayers currently send more than $260 million annually into DART's coffers, according to the agency's financial reports. The agency collected more than $545 million in sales tax revenue from all 13 member cities combined in 2016. \n\"It's the only option that works,\" Griggs said. \"We can't raise property taxes. We can't raise sales tax. The legislative climate in Austin is against raising the sales tax ceiling.\" \nThe Legislature will ultimately have to approve changes to the Dallas Police and Fire Pension System because state law governs the fund, which operates mostly independent of the city. House Pensions Committee Chairman Dan Flynn, R-Van, and his staff have been working on a compromise bill. He is expected to file it sometime in the next few days.

All sides wanted to get the pension on a course to become fully funded within 30 years. Flynn's plan would take more than 40 years to fully fund. And that would assume the fund will make an average of 7.25 percent returns on its investments annually for almost all of that time, a projection some believe is still too high. \nFlynn said in a written statement that he is encouraged that city officials are \"considering all means to continue to close the gap on pension plan funding.\" \nGriggs said the sales tax that goes to DART is a much better option than deeper cuts to city services. And voters would get to make that choice. \n\"Ultimately, this is the taxpayers' money,\" he said. \"This is not the city of Dallas' money. It's not DART's money.\" \nBut several of Griggs council colleagues will be a hard sell on taking funding away from DART. \nMayor Mike Rawlings said it's \"a terrible idea.\" \n\"An idea that we've got a huge problem for the city here and we're going to create another huge problem?\" he said. \"DART is such an important strategic asset for the city, and for southern Dallas in particular. We actually need more of DART in southern Dallas.\" \nDeputy Mayor Pro Tem Erik Wilson, who represents southwestern Dallas, is worried that it will ultimately unravel DART at a time when the agency should be trying to figure out ways to better connect people and their jobs. \n\"DART had nothing to do with getting us into this,\" Wilson said. \"The pension got us here, the pension will be what gets us out.\" \nPolice and fire association leaders came up with the idea to take money from DART to avoid the clawback issue and tax increases. \nDallas Fire Fighters Association President Jim McDade said city departments are routinely asked every year to submit ideas for budget cuts of 5 to 7 percent, and have become more efficient as a result, he said. \n\"I don't think it's going to be a choice between cutting DART services and the pension,\" McDade said. \"There are ways they can probably look internally and get more efficient.\" \nGriggs and his allies also see a potential added benefit to messing with DART's funding stream: they don't like the Cotton Belt line, a proposed light rail line that would stretch between Plano and the airport. Three projects could transform North Texas, but DART shrouds them in confusion \nDART is trying to build the Cotton Belt line and new downtown rail lines at the same time. Dallas City Council members want them to focus on the long-promised downtown lines first. \nBut reopening the battle could also backfire; the agency's officials could instead delay the Dallas projects in favor of the Cotton Belt project. Addison officials, which have also long been promised rail service, have threatened to leave DART if the Cotton Belt wasn't a priority. \nBut that would be a fight for later, if the idea ever even makes it to the voting booth. Lyons, the DART spokesman, said it's not even clear if Dallas will be allowed to reduce its sales tax payments to DART. DART votes to fund both downtown subway and suburban rail \nWhat is clearer, Lyons said, is that Dallas residents would likely pay a price if the city went down that road. \n\"The reality is service would have to be cut significantly,\" Lyons said. \"Where, how -- I don't know. I would not imagine that one of the other 12 cities would be interested in having their service cut based on the decision.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:39:18.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
