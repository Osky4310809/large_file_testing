"", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "In the days after Donald Trump won the US election, advocacy groups and media outlets, including BuzzFeed News, tracked racist and anti-Muslim incidents amid warnings of a rising tide of racial violence across the country. We had reason to expect them: Trump had just been elected after stomping on norms about public speech on race and religion, threatening to ban Muslims from the US, and calling Mexican immigrants “rapists.”\nBut the story of 2016 is in part the story of people believing what they expect to be true, regardless of the evidence. And there has not been any official data to suggest that hate crimes have surged nationally since the election. ProPublica described the data collection of hate crimes since the election as “deeply flawed.” The Southern Poverty Law Center — which published a report titled Ten Days After: Harassment and Intimidation in the Aftermath of the Election — noted that “it was not possible to confirm the veracity” of all the 867 “hate incidents” it documented, which were based off submissions to its website and media accounts. Two of the highest-profile incidents were exposed as fabrications: a Muslim woman in New York who claimed she was attacked on the subway, and a student at the University of Michigan who said a man threatened to set her on fire if she did not remove her hijab.\nConservative and right-wing media outlets seized on a post-Trump “hate hoax epidemic” and decried the mainstream media’s role in spreading “hate crime hoaxes.”\nSince BuzzFeed News was among the outlets cataloging alleged hate crimes after the election — we reported on 28 alleged incidents between Nov. 10 to Nov. 15 — we thought it would be useful to review this nonscientific sample of high-profile reports.\nWe revisited those stories over the last two weeks and found that most occurred as they were reported — disturbing incidents with an explicitly racial, religious, or political edge — though some also clearly involved a haze of confusion and disputes over motive.\nEleven cases are publicly documented — photographs of graffiti, for instance, or a witness aside from the alleged victim — but unsolved. In eight of those, authorities are still investigating. In 11 cases, a person was identified, charged, disciplined, apologized, resigned, or faced some other consequence — though in eight of those, their motives remain in dispute. Three of the remaining cases rely on a claim from a single source, without any clear resolution or specific reason to doubt the claim. Two were revealed as hoaxes. And in a third case, police said that part of the alleged victim’s story didn’t check out, and she later told authorities she no longer wanted to pursue the case. In all, 19 of the incidents referenced Trump or the election.\nSome of the incidents had an evident racial or anti-Muslim bias, though in many cases the perpetrators were not charged with hate crimes. (States have different statutes and in some the bar to prosecute an incident as a hate crime is high.)\nOther incidents happened as described — and were reasonably initially perceived as political — but the stories are a bit more complicated. A Southern Illinois University student who appeared in front of a Confederate flag in what appeared to be blackface later said it was a cosmetic mask, and the university said “we sometimes find that reports of incidents made via social media and elsewhere are not fully supported by the facts.” The man arrested for scrawling “Black Bitch” on a Philadelphia woman’s car is black.\nMeanwhile the hoaxes, which were at the center of the conversation in late December, didn’t surprise academics and journalists who study extremism and hate crimes.\n“People will do things when there’s a lot of attention paid to it, and hate crimes aren’t any different. What I find interesting is how that is being politicized now,” Brian Levin, a criminology professor and director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, told BuzzFeed News. Hate crimes, he said, spike after a catalytic event, and in that “cycle of publicity and retaliatory violence” there will be false reports.\nAs our catalog shows, there’s little evidence of a wave of hoaxes. There has also not been the wave of violent assaults that some anticipated. (The FBI did disrupt one murderous terror plot just before the election, in which Kansas militia members sought to bomb Somali refugees.)\n“Unfortunately, the relatively small handful of made-up events threaten to undermine belief in the far many more verified reports of hate and intolerance,” Jere Hester, director of news at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism, told BuzzFeed News. Hester and J-School Interactive Program Director Sandeep Junnarkar spearheaded the development of CUNY’s Hate Index — a site that chronicles hate crimes and other acts of intolerance since Trump’s win. “The small number of people who concoct incidents stand to gain a disproportionate amount of attention at the expense of the many more real victims,” he said.\nBoth experts said that hoaxes further victimize genuine victims of hate and induce mistrust of the media.\nAnd while some conservatives tied the hoaxes into the debate over “fake news” — media concoctions built from scratch to go viral on Facebook — there is no evidence journalists reporting the false stories believed they were false. Rather, the hoaxes reveal a longstanding blind spot in crime reporting: It has long been driven — certainly in initial reports — by the legal process, beginning with a police report and an investigation.\nID: 10265812 Here is the latest on the 28 cases BuzzFeed News examined : ID: 10265893 1. A man allegedly punched a woman in the face at a restaurant in New York after she expressed disappointment over Trump’s victory. View this image ›\nFacebook: BarTabacNY Original report: A man having dinner with a woman at Bar Tabac, in Brooklyn, on Nov. 12 allegedly got into an argument with a woman at the table next to him who was disappointed over Trump’s win, the restaurant manager, Jonas Leon, told media outlets. The man allegedly punched the woman in the face in front of children and left, Leon said. The man was not identified and no arrests were made at the time.\nCurrent status: There is an ongoing NYPD investigation into the incident, police told BuzzFeed News on Dec. 27. Leon told BuzzFeed news on Jan. 2 that he was called to the precinct to see pictures of possible suspects, but said that police had not found the right person. “They have nothing,” he said.\nID: 10260841 2. An Ohio State University student was arrested and charged with assault after tackling an anti-Trump protester during a demonstration on campus. Video available at: https://youtube.com/watch?v=2Cb_CBJsKZ0 . youtube.com Original report: A student, identified as 24-year-old Shane Michael Stanton, tackled anti-Trump protester Timothy Adams while he was delivering a speech on campus on Nov. 14. A video published by the Lantern showed Stanton shouting, “You idiot” before leaping at Adams from behind.\nAdams later said he did not believe the attack was politically motivated and sought to have the charges dropped. A friend of Stanton’s wrote on Facebook that he was a Hillary Clinton supporter, and his actions may have been related to a disability. His mother told the Columbus Dispatch that he has Asperger’s syndrome. Stanton was reportedly issued an indefinite suspension from OSU following his arrest.\nCurrent Status: The charges against Stanton have not been dropped and the case is set for pretrial hearing on Feb. 1, Zachary Gwin, assistant city prosecutor at the Columbus City Attorney’s Office, told BuzzFeed News on Dec. 28. Gwin said they were “in the process of plea negotiations.”\nLara N. Baker-Morrish, chief prosecutor at the Columbus City Attorney’s office, told BuzzFeed News that they had reached out to Adams to “advise him as to the status of the case as well as to discuss the options for case resolution.” She said the decision whether or not to charge Stanton rested with the Ohio State University police who filed the charges, but added that her office would ultimately make the decision whether to resolve the matter or proceed to trial.\nAdams told BuzzFeed News that the case was still “going through the court process.” He added, “Right now I’d just like to put the whole situation behind me and not discuss it further.”\nAn OSU spokesperson did not say if Stanton was still suspended, citing confidentiality of student conduct proceedings.\nID: 10260852 3. Threatening “vigilante” flyers calling for the torture of “university leaders spouting off all this diversity garbage” were posted in bathrooms across Texas State University. View this image ›\nfacebook.com Original report: The flyers, glued to bathrooms and mirrors in buildings across the campus, read: “Now that our man TRUMP is elected and republicans own both the senate and the house - - time to organize tar and feather VIGILANTE SQUADS and go arrest and torture those deviant university leaders spouting off all this Diversity Garbage.”\nOther flyers criticized the concept of diversity and its proponents. One flyer said, “NO OTHER RACE (BUT WHITES) HAS BENT OVER BACKWARDS to assure that all non-whites receive a ‘fair shake’ in being part of American life, even to the detriment and social well-being of ‘our own kinds’ (whites).” The flyer said “multiculturalism” and “diversity” are “code-words for white genocide.”\nTexas State University Police were investigating the incident, President Denise M. Trauth said in a November statement, adding, “Actions such as pasting flyers to bathroom mirrors amounts to criminal activity, and our university police are investigating these incidents.”\nCurrent Status: No arrests have been made but it remains an active investigation, a spokesperson for Texas State University told BuzzFeed News on Jan. 2. Campus police referred the matter to university officials.\nIn December, several flyers “encouraging readers to report undocumented immigrants to federal authorities were found and removed from different campus locations today,” Trauth said in a December message. “The university, following current law, does not and will not report undocumented immigrants to authorities.” These flyers were not the subject of an investigation, the spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.\nID: 10260867 4. Racial slurs and threats, including the n-word, “Go back to Africa,” and “Whites only,” along with pro-Trump slogans were found scrawled in a high school bathroom in Minnesota on Nov. 9. Facebook\nFacebook\n Original report: Local police and Maple Grove Senior High School launched investigations after graffiti, including #FuckAllPorchMonkeys, #WhitesOnly, Trump Train, #GoBackToAfrica and “Make America Great Again,” were found in the boys’ bathroom on Nov. 9.\nCurrent status: The student responsible for writing the graffiti was identified and received “appropriate disciplinary action, according to school board policy,” said a Nov. 21 letter from Osseo School District Superintendent Kate Maguire. The case is still an open active investigation for the Maple Grove Police Department, a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.\nThe student’s attorney, Andrea L. Jepsen, later said that the school was using the “sensitive and vulnerable” student as a scapegoat.\n“The district chose a sensitive and vulnerable young person who was among the students who entered the restroom on November 9, and scapegoated him,” Jepsen said in a statement provided to media outlets . “The district violated [the student’s] rights under the law, and inflicted terrible emotional damage on him, while missing the opportunity to find the real culprit. We believe that the district did so because it was very difficult to isolate the actual wrongdoer with any certainty, and bringing this matter to what the district believed would be a quick end was its highest priority.”\nID: 10260906 5. Mehreen Kasana, an editor in New York City who was wearing a scarf around her head the day after the election, said that a man told her, “Your time’s up, girlie.” View this image ›\nTwitter: @mehreenkasana Original report: Kasana told BuzzFeed News that she was wearing a scarf around her head because of the cold on Nov. 9, when a white man in his mid-thirties with a briefcase and newspaper at the Church Avenue subway station looked at her and said, “Your time’s up, girlie.” Kasana said no one at the station did anything. “I almost always fight back but I think that moment was so replete with defeat and misery that, out of the sheer need to protect myself, I remained silent,” she said. “The last thing I needed was to get pushed on the tracks.”\nCurrent status: Kasana told BuzzFeed News on Dec. 22 that she never reported the incident to the MTA or NYPD. “Prior to the election, similar things have happened and reports to the MTA didn’t equally materialize into any action or considerable safety,” she said.\nKasana also said that since she was not accompanied by anyone at the station, there were no witnesses who could support her account. She said she did not call or text any family member or friend after the alleged incident. “In retrospect, my instant response to the event was to shield myself and leave the scene before he sprung into more action,” Kasana said. BuzzFeed News could not independently verify her account.\nID: 10260913 6. Middle schoolers in Michigan chanted “Build the wall” in their lunchroom. Middle school students in Royal Oak, Michigan chanting \"Build The Wall!\"\n— Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) Original report: A group of middle schoolers in Royal Oak, Michigan, chanted “build the wall” inside their cafeteria on Nov. 9. “Because of the strong emotions and intensity of rhetoric that the posting of this incident to social media has elicited, we have had parents express concern regarding student safety,” Superintendent of Schools Shawn Lewis-Lakin said in a statement on Nov. 10.\nCurrent status : Lewis-Lakin issued a statement on Nov. 17 saying district officials had investigated the incident as per their harassment and bullying policies and “addressed the situation directly with the students involved.”\n“Remorse has been expressed,” Lewis-Lakin said without providing detail on whether the school had taken action against the students involved. “I personally have met with students and parents at the center of the incident,” he said. “On behalf of our district, I am sorry for this incident.”\nIn a separate incident, the school said it removed another student who admitted to placing a noose inside a middle school bathroom on Nov. 18, pending an investigation by the Royal Oak police. Police officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the status of that investigation.\nID: 10260921 7. A “Make America White Again” sign with a swastika was graffitied on a softball dugout wall in a park in Wellsville, New York, on Nov. 9. View this image ›\nTwitter: @brianqwdr Original report: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called it an alleged hate crime, and announced a joint investigation by the New York State Police and State Division of Human Rights. “New York has zero tolerance for bigotry, fear and hatred, and those who seek to undermine the core values this state and nation were founded upon,” Cuomo said in a statement. “I have ordered a full investigation into this deplorable act.”\nCurrent Status: No arrests have been made, and it remains an open investigation, a spokesperson for the New York State Police told BuzzFeed News on Dec. 22. Wellsville Police Chief Timothy J. O’Grady also told BuzzFeed News that there were no new developments in the case and no suspect had been identified. “The case remains open and any leads received are being investigated accordingly.”\nID: 10260941 8. Photos of a black baby doll that appeared to have been hung in an elevator in Canisius College in New York surfaced on social media. View this image ›\nTwitter: @Baby_Jay1221 Original report: In two separate incidents on Nov. 8., the doll was first placed in an elevator as a prank to startle people and then hung from a curtain rod in a residence hall room, according to a public safety report issued by Canisius College.\nContrary to social media reports, the doll was not hung from the elevator, but the elevator prank set off a chain of events “on a night when the results of the presidential election had many students feeling distressed and vulnerable,” Canisius President John Hurley said in a detailed message describing the incidents. He said that after the doll was hung in the residence hall, students took photos of it and created memes referring to “Trump fans,” which were posted to social media.\nThe students involved in the residence hall incident were suspended pending the outcome of disciplinary cases against them, the consequences of which could include dismissal from the college, Hurley said at the time.\nCurrent status: Two students, who were identified as the “primary participants” involved in hanging the doll in the residence hall room, “have left the college,” Hurley said in a Dec. 12 letter provided to BuzzFeed News.\nOthers students identified during the investigation “received sanctions appropriate to their levels of involvement in the incidents,” Hurley said.\nA former federal prosecutor hired by the college to independently review the college’s investigation concluded that the students’ conduct “did not rise to the level of a violation of federal or state hate crime laws and that we need not refer the matter to law enforcement agencies,” Hurley said.\nID: 10260952 9. A “fair-skinned male” allegedly pulled at a woman’s hijab on Nov. 9, choking her and causing her to fall, San Jose State University police said in an alert to students. Original report: The university said the case was under investigation, though it wasn’t clear if the woman, identified as 19-year-old Esra Altun, was attacked because of her hijab. Doaa Abdelrahman, the president of the Muslim Student Association at San Jose State, told the Mercury News that she knew the victim and believed the attack was related to Trump’s campaign. University police reportedly told Altun that they could not treat it as a hate crime, Mercury News reported .\nCurrent status: Patricia Harris, a spokesperson for SJSU, told BuzzFeed News on Dec. 29 that there were no arrests, no new leads, or any other developments in the case. “My understanding is there is no surveillance video of the incident, and the suspect approached Esra from behind, so she did not have the opportunity to see him face-to-face,” Harris said. “Nonetheless, we continue to press our community to report any leads.”\nAbdelrahman told BuzzFeed News that police did not “count it as a hate crime since he didn’t ‘say’ anything,” adding, “I think pulling off someone’s scarf is saying it, actions speak louder than words.”\nID: 10260961 10. “Trump” was scrawled on the door of a Muslim prayer room at New York University on Nov. 9. View this image ›\nFacebook: NewYorkUniversityMuslimStudentsAssociation Original report: On Nov. 9, a Muslim student making his way to the prayer room found “Trump” scribbled across the front of prayer space door, Afraz Khan, the president of the Muslim Students Association at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, told BuzzFeed News. The incident was reported to university officials, who Khan said were doing a “wonderful job in supporting us.”\nCurrent status: There is an ongoing investigation into the incident, the NYPD told BuzzFeed News on Dec. 27. An NYU spokesperson said they had called the NYPD at the time of discovery and referred all questions to them. Khan told BuzzFeed News that the NYPD had not reached out to the Muslim Students Association.\nID: 10260978 11. “Fuck your safe space,” “Build wall,” and “Trump” were scrawled in chalk at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette on Nov. 8.

A copy of this was provided to BuzzFeed News.\nHowever, the findings indicated that the other allegations, including the spitting, using racial and homophobic slurs, and targeting Harambee House, were “contested.”\nBrad Bailey, Tomasso’s lawyer, said in a statement: “We are very pleased with the Honor Board’s decision of finding him not responsible for any of the student conduct violations at Babson College and moreover after a thorough and complete investigation, for determining that none of the original allegations were true, specifically the findings that he did not spit at anyone, he did not make any racial or homophobic comments towards anyone, he did not make any derogatory statements towards anyone, and all of those allegations had no basis in fact.”\n“You can’t repair the reputational damage, and frankly the emotional damage that is done when you have labeled somebody a harasser,” Rand-Ricciardi’s lawyer, Jeffrey Robbins, told BuzzFeed News. He said it was “really a shame” that neither Babson College nor Wellesley College has issued a statement of apology or regret to the two men.\n“People were very happy to blacken these kids’ reputations without even knowing what the facts were,” Robbins said.\nA spokesperson for Babson College told BuzzFeed News, “As a matter of policy, and in accordance with federal law, Babson College does not comment on specific student conduct matters.”\nID: 10261060 16.
