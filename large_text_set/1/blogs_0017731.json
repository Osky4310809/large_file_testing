That is, he had a bullet lodged in his arm until yesterday, when he was able to push it out of his arm. He recorded a video of him dislodging the bullet and posted it to Instagram. \n“The Bullet That’s Been Sittin In My Shoulder The Past Few Years Decided To Come Out…. Gotta Thank God I’m Still Here,\" he wrote in the caption. \nThe video is not for the faint of heart: Trae coaxes out the massive bullet and it drops to the table with an ominous thud. Stoic. Watch it below.
