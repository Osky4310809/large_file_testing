More than two weeks after the Patriots won Super Bowl LI, the jersey is still missing. Newly released @houstonpolice report values Tom Brady's missing Super Bowl jersey at $500,000. @KPRC2 pic.twitter.com/ZNJCcobYSD \n— Syan Rhodes (@SyanRhodes) February 21, 2017 HPD report on Brady's #SB51 jersey value. pic.twitter.com/DjZmS354t0 \n— Syan Rhodes (@SyanRhodes) February 21, 2017 \nPretty big markup from the Brady jerseys you can buy at the team store. \nWhile the Honus Wagner baseball card would laugh at a mere $500,000, it seems high for a jersey from 2017. Some jerseys have been auctioned for more but most of them are almost a century old and worn by Babe Ruth, including a 1920 jersey that went for $4.4 million . But Brady’s jersey is certainly valuable, and probably more valuable now that it has a story attached to it. \nUSA Today quoted Josh Evans , the founder and chairman of the auction website Lelands.com, as saying Brady’s jersey could sell for a million in an auction. Before the theft, Evans said it might have been worth about $250,000. \nThe jersey is infamous due to the bold theft, and whoever has it owns a $500,000 (or more) article of memorabilia he or she can’t sell or display because it was obtained illegally. Smart. \nGiven that Brady wore that jersey as he won his record-setting fifth Super Bowl, he probably couldn’t even put a price on it, no matter how high that price is getting.
