It was instead to be played by producer-writer-director Colonel RK Kapoor's son. In a Deccan Chronicle report, Shahrukh had said, \"A lot of what I am today is courtesy luck. The colonel's son, who was the cinematographer, was also to play the lead. But he realised he can't do both simultaneously and decided to stick to cinematography. The colonel couldn't find a replacement in time, so he said, 'Hey, you. You are the one. You are good, jolly good. Come on. Go there.'. And I became Abhimanyu Rai, overnight.
