A $3.8 billion proposal by President Donald Trump is expected to complicate lawmakers’ negotiations to prevent a government shutdown. \nSenate Republican leaders signaled Tuesday that they are unlikely to seriously pursue Trump’s supplemental border wall funding to avoid a potential government shutdown, courtesy of Senate Democrats who have vowed to block any funding of the 30-foot southern border wall. \nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Senator Roy Blunt (R-Missouri), a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, confirmed that he had received the $1 billion request for supplemental funding that would build an estimated 62 miles of the border wall, according to The Hill. It also includes a $2.8 billion request for border infrastructure and technology for next year as well.

However, Cornyn remained positive that “ there’s not going to be a shutdown. ” Mexican congressman trolls #Trump by climbing 'the wall' (VIDEO, PHOTOS) https://t.co/4Nm6yPHAUY pic.twitter.com/nKwDxEdWqR   3, 2017 \nEven if there won’t be a shutdown over the wall, there’s another issue looming on the horizon. Following the fierce debate over repealing   (ACA), Republicans could be in for another fight when it comes to refunding the ACA. While the Republicans’ Freedom Caucus is unlikely to move forward with anything short of repealing the measure, Democrats are equally unlikely to be in favor of any measures that defund Planned Parenthood, meaning that passing any cuts or additions to the ACA could make it difficult to reach the necessary 216 approval votes to pass the legislation. \n“ Republicans have always needed help from the Democrats, ” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Massachusetts) told Fox News. “ They never came up with votes on their own. ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:20:37.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
