Another 6,200 jobs across the company will be eliminated as part of efforts to streamline operations and cut costs.\nMacy’s estimates the changes will generate savings of approximately $550 million, beginning in 2017. In a statement announcing the cuts , the company said it plans to invest $250 million in “growing the digital business, store-related growth strategies” as well as new in-store concepts like Bluemercury, the chain’s makeup line, the cut-price Macy’s Backstage chain, and expansion in China.\nThe retailer had a disappointing holiday sales season, with luxury goods like watches and hand-bags moving slower than anticipated, and reduced shopping at brick and mortar locations.\n“We continue to experience declining traffic in our stores where the majority of our business is still transacted,” said Chief Executive Officer Terry Lundgren in a statement, adding that the company’s strategies “continue to evolve based on the changes in our customers’ shopping behaviors, including a focus on buy online, pickup in store and mobile-enabled shopping.”\nIn June, Macy’s narrowly avoided a strike by 5,000 workers at their flagship store in New York over pay and healthcare benefits.", "external_links": ["http://bigstory.ap.org/article/acafb8497feb4a14867fa6d4a3581eca/macys-reaches-tentative-deal-union", "http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=84477&p=irol-newsArticle&cat=news&id=2234057"], "published": "2017-01-05T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:26:37.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
