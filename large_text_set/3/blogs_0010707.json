It has been wildly unclear if current star Daniel Craig will return to the franchise, with many a-list names floating around as possible replacements in the next film. \nWhile a recent report indicates that the forthcoming twenty-fifth Bond film is moving forward in pre-production, there is a chance that it could happen without Craig. \nA recent tweet from British entertainment reporter Baz Bamigboye reveals that the writing team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade will be writing the next film, whether or not Craig is in the title role. This comes after a recent report that the project is already making negotiatons to film in Dubrovnik, Croatia. \nWriters #nealpurvis & #robertwade hired to write story for #Bond25 . #DanielCraig still deciding whether he will do it pic.twitter.com/AyF0JlFUV6 â€” Baz Bamigboye (@BazBam) March 9, 2017 \nPurvis and Wade are names that are probably familiar to Bond fans, as the pair have helped co-write five different films in the franchise, stretching as far back as 1999's The World Is Not Enough . \nThe duo have had a hand in all of Craig's outings as the popular character, including 2015's Spectre , but it's unclear if that will be enough to keep the actor on board the project. According to a later tweet from Bamigboye, Craig's indecision about staying with the franchise has to do with \"factors other than [the next film's] script.\" \nBut even then, it still remains uncertain if Craig will in fact be leaving. Naomie Harris , who co-starred with the actor in both Skyfall and Spectre , recently voiced her opinion on the matter, saying that she believes there is a \"good chance\" that he will continue to play Bond. \nHowever, if Craig were to leave the franchise, there are certainly plenty of actors available to take his place. \nPopular suggestions in recent months have included Tom Hiddleston (despite the actor denying any rumors of him getting the role back in June of last year), Ryan Gosling , and Tom Hardy (who had one very specific request if he were to take the role). Bamigboye's most recent suggestion has been Boardwalk Empire and Ben-Hur actor Jack Huston . \nWhile this news of a script being written is sure to be welcomed by Bond fans, they will just have to wait and see who ends up filling the title role.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:51:39.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
