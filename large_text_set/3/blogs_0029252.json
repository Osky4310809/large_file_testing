First off, practically everyone knew you so no matter what you were doing, you always has to take into consideration the fact that you might bump into about 12 people, ten of whom will go back and report the incident to your parents, relatives, and nosy aunties. Going to school in a small town was equally, if not more, stressful. You had teachers who've even taught your parents, and things like bunking lectures didn't even cross your mind because the teacher knew all the handout spots (given the fact that there were just two of them in the city). While the familiarity could be nice at times, when you were thirteen and needed an escape, it wasn't the best thing in the world. \nIf you went to school in a small town, we bet you'll relate to these things. \n1. Everyone knew exactly who you were... how much marks your siblings got, and how hard you had to work to live up to the family name.2. You barely bunked school, because everyone knew everyone so you'd always get busted. \n3. Plus all the teachers knew where you lived (thanks to your sibling who was in the same class earlier), so they'd always come around to snitching too.4. And there was always one teacher who was also related to you. *awkward* \n5. \"When I taught your father/mother...\" was a sentence you'd heard three times in a week, uttered by the teacher and principal.6. You were forced to hang out with your sibling's best friend's sibling... everyone was in the same school after all. \n7. Everything - from your books, to your school sweater was second hand.8. Dating your friend's ex wasn't that big a deal. You barely had any options. \n9. Bumping into your teachers at the mall was no big deal. Small town remember?!10. Remember how people wrote their names on their desks so that people remembered them... Yeah that was not needed in your school.11. In fact you and your sibling share the exact same school memories... same annoying teachers, same horrible food, and same broken classroom supplies.
