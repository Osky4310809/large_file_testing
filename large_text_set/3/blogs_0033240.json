Very soon, however, they become the target of the dollmaker’s possessed creation, Annabelle . \nSandberg directs from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman, who also wrote the first film. Annabelle: Creation stars Stephanie Sigman ( SPECTRE ), Talitha Bateman ( The 5th Wave ), Lulu Wilson ( Ouija: Origin of Evil , Deliver Us from Evil ), Philippa Coulthard ( After the Dark ), Grace Fulton ( Badland ), Lou Lou Safran ( The Choice ), Samara Lee ( Foxcatcher, The Last Witch Hunter ), Tayler Buck in her feature film debut, with Anthony LaPaglia ( Without a Trace ) and Miranda Otto ( Homeland, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy ). \nServing as executive producers on Annabelle 2 are Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Walter Hamada, Dave Neustadter and Hans Ritter. \nScheduled for release on August 11, 2017, Annabelle: Creation is a New Line Cinema presentation, an Atomic Monster/Safran Company production.
