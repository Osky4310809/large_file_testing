Which means one thing and one thing only: Freaking out over red carpet looks! (Oh, and celebrating the beauty and splendor of that which is modern cinema…but…back to the red carpet). Because Kirsten Dunst’s 2017 Oscars dress is begging to be discussed .\nDunst, who appeared in one of this year’s biggest hits, Hidden Figures , showed up to the red carpet in the simplest and most elegant of Christian Dior black dresses . The sleeveless, off-the-shoulder gown fell just above the ankle and gave way to a long, distinctly bride-like train in the back. Tim Burton himself could not have picked a more perfectly goth gown.\nShe completed the look with strappy black Christian Lacriox heels (which were perfectly on display thanks to the dress’s length) and a simple diamond necklace and earrings.\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images And yes, the above dress includes POCKETS. Which, in our humble opinions, takes the outfit to the next level (and probs provides tons of space for secret snacking. Because let’s be real, the award ceremony is LONG and there aren’t any breaks).\nDunst complimented the all-black ensemble with rosy cheeks and a classic red lip, along with coal-black eyeliner (which makes her blue eyes look GORGEOUS, in case you had any doubts).\nLester Cohen/Getty Images \nThis has been a pretty awesome year for Dunst. In addition to being a part of one of 2016’s most beloved films, she also got engaged to Fargo costar Jesse Plemons (aka LANDRY FOR LIFE!). The two allegedly became fast friends while filming the series in the cold north, and the rest is beautiful history.\nMatt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images Hidden Figures is nominated for Best Picture tonight, and we’re wishing Dunst and the whole cast the best of luck!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:31:17.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
