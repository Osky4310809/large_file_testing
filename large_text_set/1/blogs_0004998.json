Obinson Niñal Jr./Presidential Photo   President Rodrigo Duterte has said that he is open to joint military exercises with Russia, Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said on Thursday. Duterte had expressed his interest in working with both China and Russia \"to make this world peaceful.\" However, he has also said that he is not yet ready for new military alliances even as he announced that the Philippines will follow an \"independent foreign policy\" away from longtime ally the US. READ: Duterte: I'm not ready for new military alliances \"As far as we understand it, he was referencing permanent stay [by foreign troops],\" Abella said during a press briefing at Malacañang. He added that joint exercises may be something the Philippine government will consider. Meanwhile, Abella said that the goodwill visit by the Russian Navy may contribute to strengthening the friendship with the Philippine Navy. Last Tuesday, Russian Navy vessels Admiral, Tributs, a large anti-submarine ship, and Brois Butoma, a large sea tanker, docked at Manila South Harbor for a port call. \"It also is an indication that the maritime cooperation can further be enhanced to enable diplomacy and camaraderie,\" Abella said. However, Abella said that, according to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, \"these things (exercises) will be dependent on the signing of an MOU, which was initiated in 2014.\" Abella said that the Memorandum of Understanding will provide the framework for engagement between Filipino and Russian troops. \"[That will include] military to military, visiting students, mutual exchanges, and joint military exercises,\" Abella said. Philippine and Russian defense officials met in Moscow in April 2016 to discuss possible areas of cooperation, the Department of Foreign Affairs said last May. Among the issues discussed was the planned Philippine-Russia Memorandum of Understanding on Defense Cooperation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T10:59:54.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
