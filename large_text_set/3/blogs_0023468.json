Cuomo has kicked his 2020 presidential campaign into higher gear. \nFrom here on out, view everything the gov says and does through that prism.\nCuomo wildly denounced the “rabid conservative zealotry” supposedly waging “a targeted war on New York” and telling the state “to drop dead.”\nThis, on a measure from New York congressmen — an amendment to the health-care bill that would relieve upstate counties of their burdensome Medicaid costs and shift them to Albany.\nThe gov calls it “a deathtrap” that will “decimate” the health-care industry outside New York City. \nRep. Chris Collins (R-Buffalo) says it’s relief for taxpayers “tired of footing the bill” for the state’s out-of-control Medicaid system “that is putting our counties on the brink of bankruptcy.”\nPlaces like Erie County, which must spend 82.8 percent of its total property-tax levy on Medicaid. Or Rockland County, which spends 61 percent.\nThe measure stops states from shifting Medicaid costs onto counties outside New York City (exempted because of the $5 billion cost) or face federal funding cuts. It’s “New York-only” because this is the only state to shift major Medicaid costs that way.\nAnd even though the county share has been cut from 25 percent to 13 percent, that’s still $2.3 billion a year and the largest single financial burden counties face. And it’s a pure unfunded mandate:\nCounties have no say in who or what Medicaid covers — they just get the bill. \nAll this, as the gov pads his staff with political hacks who, as one consultant put it, “know how to do things beyond the Hudson River.” \nWhich is plainly where Cuomo’s now focused — not on New York’s real interests.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:30:18.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
