Friday will mark his fifth straight as coach at VASJ (21-6), which plays Proctorville Fairland (25-1) at Schottenstein Center in the Division III state semifinals. \nVASJ can become the first boys basketball program in OHSAA history to play in five straight state championship games. It also can win the program’s seventh title. \nKwasniak looked over to his father, Tedd Kwasniak, after Tuesday’s practice and pointed to him. \n“That’s the reason,” he said. “People won’t remember what you did. They’ll always remember how you made them feel.” \nTedd, 75, and Roe Kwasniak had five children. All of them played basketball, from their oldest, Joy , to sons Babe and T.J. to daughters Julie and June. \nYet when Babe Kwasniak — a two-year captain at West Point and former gold medal-winning coach for the armed forces — takes his teams to Columbus, he feels like “Coach Kwas’ son.” After all, his father sat on the bench for all six of VASJ’s state championships as an assistant or head coach. \n“St. Joe’s has been synonymous with the Kwasniaks for so long,” assistant coach Rich Newlon said. “It’s special because it just keeps going.” \nThe coaching careers of Babe and Tedd Kwasniak have sometimes mirrored each other, too. When Babe, Melvin Levett and their class graduated in 1994 after three state titles in four years, Tedd Kwasniak returned with a new group and won another state crown. \nJust last year, VASJ had to replace nearly all of its roster with three players now at Division I colleges. The Vikings still found their way to the state title game. \n“It’s a shame he wasn’t the Division III coach of the year because no one expected St. Joe back,” Lima Central Catholic coach Frank Kill said after last year’s state final . \nYet the program seems relentless. \nTedd Kwasniak said his son was like that during his playing days. \n“Kids would go out on Friday night, and he’d be in the driveway,” Tedd Kwasniak said. “He’d go out, but not till after he got his workout in. He had the Steve Alford workout, and he’d chart everything. At the end of it, he’d shoot 100 free throws. And for every free throw he missed, he’d do 10 pushups.” \nThere were times Tedd Kwasniak reined in his fiery son. Like the time Babe and Levett botched an alley-oop. \n“I threw Melvin another pass, but Melvin missed the dunk,” Babe Kwasniak said. “Instead of yelling at Melvin, he yelled at me. I got mad and kicked out of practice. My cousin had to pick me up. At the time, I didn’t understand it. But now I realize that was leadership.” \nThen there was the time as an underclassman when Babe missed crucial free throws that cost VASJ a game. His father knew what to say. \n“I would go outside and practice in the snow. I cried myself to sleep,” Babe Kwasniak said, “and he would always tell me I don’t care if you don’t win another race, you’re always going to be my horse.” \nThose messages registered with many players who have walked through VASJ's doors. \n“He’s the oldest guy in the gym but he has more passion than anybody,” said Duane Gibson, a 2013 VASJ grad and Plain Dealer Player of the Year . \nGibson is now at Evansville, but he talks with the elder Kwasniak about once per week. The 6-foot-3 guard credits him for making the initial push that turned Gibson into the Vikings’ point guard. \nIt translated into a state championship by 2013. \n“He yelled at me every day, but I know he cared,” Gibson said. “If I called him right now, he’d have something to yell at me about.” \nDuring the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament, the Kwasniaks anxiously watched as 2015 graduate Dererk Pardon stepped to the free-throw line for six critical shots that clinched Northwestern’s 68-66 first-round victory. \nEven if Pardon — a 51.7-percent free-throw shooter — had not made those foul shots, he still had a place in the VASJ stable. \nPardon returned to his alma mater Sunday, surprising teammates who looked up to him during a 2015 state title run. Homecomings are common. \nBabe Kwasniak had his own just before VASJ hired him in 2010. \nHe spent more than a decade away. Most of it came with a basketball and service career with the United States Army. Kwasniak played four seasons at West Point. He coached service teams to international gold medals through 2004 and left for an assistant college coaching job. \nIn the meantime, his father parted with VASJ but found other coaching opportunities. Tedd Kwasniak guided Lake Catholic for seven seasons. He was an assistant at Euclid when Babe Kwasniak walked into VASJ to see the Vikings face his father and the Panthers. \nBabe Kwasniak said he expected to root for Euclid. He reasoned that VASJ had let go of his father after a heart attack during the 1998-99 season. Tedd Kwasniak said he didn’t want to leave. \n“When they got rid of him, I thought it was unjustified,” Babe Kwasniak said. “It was hard for me to forgive this place.” \nBut a funny thing happened that night he watched his dad coach against VASJ. Euclid won by 25 points, and it irritated him. \nThe VASJ job opened before the next season, and Kwasniak applied. He got it after an arduous process that included the program being placed on probation . VASJ quickly bounced back. The school had both Kwasniaks in the fold. \n“It’s a dream,” Tedd Kwasniak said. “There’s been some bumps along the way, but this is going to be my 12th trip to Columbus. There’s coaches who know more in their little finger than I know, and they never made it to Columbus. The Lord has been good to me.” \nThese days, they take Babe’s three sons — the oldest is in seventh grade — on their trips to Columbus. \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
