I think so, because despite my day job I sank a frankly absurd amount of time into the original—especially the brilliant 6-player raids like Vault of Glass and Wrath of the Machine. But equally I can understand why many PC gamers are cool on the idea. After all, the original Destiny had the rockiest of rides at launch, thanks to its confusing endgame, borderline broken economies (“hello loot cave, my old friend”), and a black hole where the story was supposed to be. \nBut over the following three years, Bungie has been able to right its listing spaceship thanks to multiple patches and DLC drops, most notably The Taken King expansion, which fixed key systems, shored up the world building, and generally made the grind more enjoyable. There were still missteps along the way—I shiver when I remember re-levelling every Exotic weapon in the House of Wolves era—but in terms of comebacks, Destiny has been the console equivalent of Diablo 3’s return from the brink. \nNow, with the sequel potentially under six months away, I want to talk about what it needs to ensure success on PC. Let’s take performance scaling and variable framerates as things we should just expect in 2017, even if it is a decade since Halo 2, which was the last game Bungie released on PC. With both High Moon Studios and Vicarious Visions assisting development on Destiny 2, it’s likely that the PC version may be outsourced, but regardless of the provenance, this is what I’ll be looking for... 1. Persistent accounts across platforms \nThis may seem a strange one to start with, but bear with me. The original Destiny suffered from platform exclusivity deals between Sony and Activision that meant PlayStation players got certain PvP maps, Exotic weapons, and even Strike missions a year ahead of their Xbox counterparts. The leaked poster mentions the beta will take place on PS4, implying similar deals can be expected for Destiny 2. Destiny 2 looks to launch on Sept 8th with a possible beta before! #destiny2 pic.twitter.com/XnhI992sID March 23, 2017 \nAnything that discourages people from playing on PC is bad from our point of view, because we want the healthiest playerbase possible. So let’s hope Bungie enables persistent accounts so players can hop platforms easily (the exclusive content would just be disabled). Aligning the PC and Xbox versions would also represent an easy win for Microsoft. With the next Xbox (currently dubbed ‘Scorpio’), almost certain to be what we’d consider a current mid to high-end PC in a box, being able to use the same characters and gear on both would be a boon for those who like to play at a desk and on the couch. \nNote also that this year’s Resident Evil 7 was a ‘Play Anywhere’ title, meaning saves transferred automatically between PC and XB1. Buying it through the Windows 10 Store also gave you access to both versions, as per first-party titles like Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3. While I don’t expect that sort of largesse from Activison, the precedent for account sharing is there. 2. Avoid the Sahara-style content droughts \nHere’s a trickier one. Destiny’s biggest problem to date has been the vast periods of time between balance patches and DLC drops, which has led to the community getting increasingly burned out and irate at replaying the same content ad infinitum. The bad news is that, even with a much improved engine, Bungie isn’t going to be able to solve this. However fast the developer pumps out new stuff, the community will burn through it faster. Now for the good news: the community might also hold the answer. \nImagine a world in which Destiny 2 ships with a retooled version of Halo 3’s Forge mode , enabling players to create and share new missions and maps. Bungie’s community team could pick the best stuff each week, stick it on a leaderboard, and attach loot rewards for completion. The potential, especially on PC where editing is inevitably going to be easier with mouse and keyboard, would only be limited by the tools. And the inherent creativity of gamers coming from the modding scene means I’d expect the most exciting stuff to get made on PC first, and then propagated to the consoles. 3. Don’t forget to include a story this time \nVanilla Destiny brought us such scriptwriting gems as", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:48:20.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
