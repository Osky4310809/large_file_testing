The Internet, of course, went wild, writing joke after joke on Bush Hager’s flub. But it wasn’t until Michael Keaton made the same mistake while presenting the award for Best Supporting Actress that Twitter really took off, starting a viral hashtag titled #GoldenGlobeErrors that conflated the titles of other movies with African-American casts.
