Turkey subsequently told Holland’s ambassador to the nation to not return from a trip for “some time.” \nThis criticism of NATO allies is not new to the Erdogan regime. In January, Erdogan said the U.S. founded ISIS and a lawmaker who is part of the president’s party said the CIA was behind a terrorist attack at an Istanbul nightclub. A State Department official told TheDC at the time, “We note with concern that Turkish media and Turkish officials have made incendiary and false accusations that the United States in some way facilitated this attack.” \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson is expected to visit Turkey on March 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:48:19.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
