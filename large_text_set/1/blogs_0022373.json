Her Ex Nathan Splits With Girlfriend Jessica Henry \n“Here’s the deal… April of 2016 I filmed the car cam scene with David and found out at lunch from my Endo. I was pregnant,” she tweeted before giving birth. “A week or few days later we flew out to the reunion, end of April 2016. At that time I had to go see a doctor because I thought it was the time of my month. Saw the OBGYN the Doctors show connected me with in LA. He conducted an ultrasound and told me I was not pregnant.”\nShe added how she didn’t want to explain on-camera that she was no longer pregnant. She then found out she was expecting again in June .\nBut fans didn’t buy Evans’ story.\nPHOTOS; Jenelle Evans Back In Court As MTV Cameras Capture All The Drama \n“So your due date is Jan 28?
