Sorry Setting up DLP features for email security \nIt's been over a year since I presented on LostPass at ShmooCon, and in that time, many more bugs have been found in password managers. The most severe of which are in browser-based password managers extensions such as LastPass. \nTavis Ormandy yesterday demonstrated a remote code execution on the latest LastPass version . This isn't the first extremely severe bug he's found in LastPass, either; there've been so many extremely severe bugs in LastPass it would be tedious to list them out. But LastPass isn't alone: Keeper , Dashlane and even 1Password have had severe vulnerabilities that allowed attackers to steal all of the passwords in a user's account without their knowledge. \nThis should be obvious to everyone who has been paying attention: browser-based password manager extensions should no longer be used because they are fundamentally risky and have the potential to have all of your credentials stolen without your knowledge by a random malicious website you visit or by malvertising. RELATED: The paranoid userâ€™s guide to Windows 10 privacy \nWhen you use a browser extension password manager, you give attackers an API to interact with your password manager via JavaScript or the DOM. That's how LostPass worked, and it's how many of the new attacks work, too. Desktop-based password managers have no such access, as they require compromising the local machine first, which is much harder than visiting a webpage. \nYour password manager extension de jour might not be as bug ridden as LastPass, but it suffers from the same risk vector if it's a browser extension. If you're using it in a corporate environment to share passwords, now only one user of many needs to be attacked to steal all of your passwords via a previously undisclosed bug. \nIf you think criminals aren't mining LastPass and others for bugs right now, you're naive. What password managers should you use instead? \nDoes this mean you should give up and not use a password manager at all? No, but the choice is trickier than these companies' marketing would leave you to believe. Desktop-based password managers \nAny program that is not resident in your browser is safer than one that is. There are many choices to choose from in this category, and none of them suffers from the direct-access-via-JavaScript risk category. \nIf you do use one, do not install the browser extensions. Copy and paste the passwords from the app into your browser. I use pass because it's simple to understand for technical folks, but I have many friends who use KeePass . If you are buying a password manager from a company, you should ask to see the details of their latest source code security review. If they're reluctant, maybe you should be reluctant to put the crown jewels of your company in their hands. \nCopying and pasting passwords into the wrong place is not a large enough risk to use a risky browser password manager extension. If you accidentally paste one password in the wrong place, it is easy to change. If you get all your passwords stolen by a new bug, you'll never even know, and you'll have little to no recourse. Built-in browser password managers \nEvery major browser now has a well-designed, built-in password manager that is easy to use. These are a nice choice if you dislike copying and pasting passwords into websites. All of them also offer mobile sync so you can have your passwords on the go.
