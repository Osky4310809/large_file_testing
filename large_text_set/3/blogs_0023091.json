For those of you who exclusively shoot on Canon cameras, the Canon UK has just launched its official clothing line that includes t-shirts, hats, sweaters, hoodies, windbreakers, and baby bibs, as well as other merchandise, like umbrellas and bags. \nIt seems as though Canon had some fun while conceptualizing its line of merchandise—I mean, the names of each item resembles the that of their camera gear, like the Windbreaker AP-WB001 and the Vintage Hoodie AP-HO001. The company's history has also been a focal point for the look of t-shirt and hoodie, with designs that illustrate the 80-year timeline of Canon cameras, as well as a vintage Kwanon logo, which was the name it went by before switching to Canon. Each sell for about $35. \nCanon Camera History T-shirt AP-TS001 Canon Vintage Logo T-shirt AP-TS002 Canon Vintage Logo Hoodie AP-HO001 \nBut while most of the items in Canon's clothing line are designed for sheer aesthetic value, the windbreaker, which is about $155, includes pockets for lens, SD card, and battery storage, as well as a detachable lens cleaning cloth. Canon is also offering two limited-edition camera bags, a backpack ($108) and a messenger bag ($98), that are big enough to store an EOS DSLR body, 2-3 lenses, and other accessories. \nCanon Windbreaker AP-WB001 Canon Camera Backpack BP-12 Canon Messenger Camera Bag MS11 And then you got some fun, inexpensive stuff, like $30 umbrellas, $15 hats, and $10 baby bibs that might make perfect gifts for the Canon lover in your life, even if that Canon lover is you. \nCanon Vintage Logo Cap AP-CA001 Canon Umbrella MC-UB001 Canon Gear Baby Bib MC-BB002 \nHead on over to Canon's official merchandise page to check out all of the new gear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:05:26.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
