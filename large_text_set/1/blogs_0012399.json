When the vote was taken and the resolution passed 4-0, the audience in the chamber erupted in cheers and a prolonged chant in Spanish of Si se pudo , or \"yes we did,\" until Mayor Valery Muñoz called the meeting back to order. \nLa Puente is the latest in a wave of municipalities and school districts in the L.A. area to declare themselves sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants in the wake of the 2016 election. A sanctuary city is one that refuses to cooperate in the detention or removal of immigrants, or to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to access city data on the immigration status of residents. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with ICE. \nSanta Ana in Orange County passed a similar resolution in December. That same month, in response to Trump’s election, school districts in the cities of San Bernardino, Bassett and Montebello declared themselves sanctuaries; other districts such as Pasadena Unified and L.A. Unified declared their schools “safe zones.” \nIn a related move, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors approved on Jan. 10 the creation of an Office of Immigrant Affairs to coordinate and facilitate access to countywide services for immigrants.
