Wild Briana DeJesus To Join Cast, Sources Say Find out what the moms thinks of the shocking addition. Posted on Mar 23, 2017 @ 18:44PM \nMove over, Jenelle , Leah , Kailyn and Chelsea ! Former 16 & Pregnant and Teen Mom 3 standout Briana DeJesus is joining the cast of Teen Mom 2, multiple sources confirmed to RadarOnline.com. \nFlorida native DeJesus, 22 — who frequently fought with baby daddy Devoin Austin and her mother Roxy on the sole season of the 2013 show — has already begun filming scenes for TM2’s 8th season, The Ashley’s Reality Roundup first reported . \nBut at least two cast members of the hit series are unhappy with the shocking new addition. \n“It something isn’t broke, why fix it?” one source said. “The show is doing beyond well.” \nPHOTOS: Betrayal! Nude Photos! Arrests & More: Teen Moms’ 20 Most Shocking Scandals \n“It’s the most bizarre move MTV has ever made,” another huffed. “They are jumping the shark!” \nSources shut down speculation that MTV is bringing on DeJesus because one of the women is planning to quit. \nThough happily married mom Houska , 25, has been rumored to be leaving, insiders say she’s going to stay for at least another season. \n“Chelsea has a great producer now, and has been able to avoid most of the chaos that MTV likes to push,” an insider insisted. \nPHOTOS: So Young, So Plastic! ‘Teen Moms’ & Other Young Stars Who Went Under The Knife \nDeJesus will certainly spice up the show, which saw Houska and Messer , 24, lead quieter, relatively drama-free lives this past season. \nShe publicly underwent plastic surgery on her boobs, butt and lady parts early last year, started Twitter feuds with Evans and recently announced another pregnancy with an unknown baby daddy , just like Lowry. \nMeanwhile, her ex Austin has been arrested multiple times on various charges and was found guilty for drug possession and shoplifting . \nMTV has not responded to Radar’s call for comment. \n  Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:01:04.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
