Instead, each episode will feature a new host and guest star.\nThe trailer teases hilarious odd couples like Shaquille O’Neal and John Cena, as well as more action taking place outside of the car as the celebs venture into bakeries, laundromats, and basketball courts.\nThe company ordered 16 episodes of the show last year, but a release date has yet to be confirmed. Check out the trailer above.\nAfter you’ve finished, take a look inside Daft Punk’s pop-up shop .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:32:29.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
