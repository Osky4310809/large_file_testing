It was then uploaded by other Facebook users. \nIn the video, the man can be seen boiling the pot of water on a stove. He then tells someone off screen to “open the window.” A white and brown cat can is heard meowing and then is seen at the window. The man says, “b*tch move, move,” and “get the f**k down!” \nThe man or a woman off camera begins making kissing noises toward the cat, which is near a litter box outside the window on a deck. The splash of the boiling water hitting the cat and deck can be heard and the cat cries out, racing around the deck. The man then tells the cat not to come back while the cat’s cries can be heard in the distance. \nThe caption on the now-deleted post said “I feel bad for the cat but you gotta do what you gotta do.” \nThe cat survived the attack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T08:42:10.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
