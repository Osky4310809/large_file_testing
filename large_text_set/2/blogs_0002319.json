The 23 year old is currently living in Kentucky but is looking at getting into pro wrestling. Brian Jr. was just three years old when his father passed away on October 5th, 1997. His death was caused by a previously undetected heart condition, arteriosclerotic heart disease, which also led to the death of his father several years before. As seen below, he tweeted Storm and mentioned talking with Steve Austin about Storm's training program. Also below are a few Instagram posts from the son of the former WCW Tag Team Champion. @LanceStorm Just saw as I was leaving my desk at work.
