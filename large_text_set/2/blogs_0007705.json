Nearly three percent of the 5,800 registered voters surveyed had mixed feelings. \nThe bottom line is that people who opposed (or still oppose) the president are starting to understand his vision more clearly. \nThey can see that 45 wants to put America – and Americans – first, no matter what. \nThe temporary travel ban may have been poorly executed (probably should’ve waited until Sen. Jeff Sessions was confirmed as attorney general), but Trump is making it a point to get things done quickly. \nAmerica voted for change and they want it now. \n#MAGA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:07:21.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
