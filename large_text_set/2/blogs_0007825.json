Photo: NBC 4 \nTwo teenage boys in Thousand Oaks, California claim that their Dell laptop repeatedly burst into flames — and they’ve got the footage to prove it! \nCheck it out below. As if we needed another reason to hold onto our MacBooks! \nThe laptop allegedly didn’t stop at one explosion. After the first fire — which started while the laptop was charging O — was extinguished, the laptop was unplugged and taken outside, where it apparently started burning again. It then proceeded to burst into flames two more times, before being sprayed with a fire extinguisher. \nWithout being able to examine the laptop there’s no way of confirming for definite whether this is legit and not a hoax. However, there have been numerous previous instances of lithium-ion batteries catching fire. \nThe most notable recent instance was Samsung’s ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, which prompted a series of scary incidents when it was launched — ranging from torching a family’s jeep to causing the evacuation of a Southwest Airlines flight after a passenger’s Note 7 emitted a thick grey-green smoke and burned a hole in the plane’s carpet. \nOther incidents involving exploding tech devices have blamed dodgy third party chargers, which one recent report claimed are overwhelmingly likely to fail basic safety tests . \nWe’ll observe the outcome of this current exploding Dell story with interest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:39:59.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
