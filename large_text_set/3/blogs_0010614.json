Villanova didn’t mess around, discarding Creighton 74-60 to win its second league tournament title in three seasons. And given how Villanova corrected itself from a near-upset against Seton Hall on Friday with its swift removal of the Bluejays, the Wildcats look frighteningly capable of winning the national title as we turn to the NCAA Tournament . \nThat’s a great thing for college basketball. Getting the reigning national champion to return to the Big Dance as a No. 1 seed is uncommon. Even less common is getting champs who wind up entering the tournament, target on back, as the best team in college basketball. \nOver the course of this season, given the entire body of work, Villanova has done just that. This was the best team in college basketball at the end of last season and looks like the best, most assured, most confident team in the sport. \nThe NCAA Tournament always delivers, but this one’s going to feel different because of where Villanova stands and what it has done. The first weekend is reserved for buzzer-beaters, Cinderella stories and off-the-wall, unpredictable things that pump up the interest. The 1 seeds, unless upsets go down in the second round, don’t become a storyline until the second weekend. Kris Jenkins and Villanova look ready to roll to another Final Four. USATSI \nVillanova will buck that trend, specifically because it will be a 1-seed (and, again, should be the No. 1 overall) filled with familiar faces, a famous coach, a stout Big East brand and still, I bet, a plethora of doubters. That’s fine. Bring on the skeptics. Villanova has been one of three or four best programs in college basketball in the past four years. If it can make a Final Four run, it will amount to modern college hoops royalty. \nNova might be the biggest talking point in college hoops over the next three days, and it deserves to be. Though the Wildcats brought back a lot from last year’s team, this kind of success was not a given. Ask John Calipari, Rick Pitino, Kevin Ollie, Roy Williams, Jim Boeheim and a lot of other legendary coaches who tried to coach their teams back to the highest heights a year after winning a title, only to come up short. \nSo with Villanova streaking into the Big Dance, college basketball has itself a fun, compelling storyline to track. The last team to win back-to-back titles was the 2006-07 Florida teams under Billy Donovan. This Villanova team is better. VU entered the season not as a preseason No. 1 (that was Duke ) but as a consensus top-five team. It hasn’t been a letdown in any regard, not a one. The Wildcats’ only losses were by two points at Marquette , then a sweep at the hands of Butler . \nNo shame in that. It’s the only three-loss team in college basketball, and the only other team with fewer losses is Gonzaga. \nVillanova’s 31-3 mark presents the lowest total in the loss column for a reigning champion since Duke was 29-3 heading into the 2002 NCAAs. \nLast season’s Villanova talking point was about shaking off March disappointment and merely winning three games in the tournament to validate reputation. Then it became a charmed Final Four run, then Kris Jenkins gave the sport its best ending ever. This year’s Villanova team is chasing all-time greatness, a back-to-back run that would go down as one of the best stories in sports in 2017. \nWe’re still a long way away from that, but it feels a lot closer now than it did even a months ago. Villanova has become one of the surest things in college hoops, and having a tournament with a reigning champ, an indefatigable favorite like Villanova only adds to the interest and intensity. \nThere’s no doubt about it: this team looks ready to repeat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T03:42:15.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
