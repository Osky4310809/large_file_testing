With the Knicks trailing at the end of regulation, Anthony forced overtime with this incredible drive to the rim.\nAnthony did the same thing to close out the first overtime and send the two teams to a second one.\nAfter Anthony fouled out, Courtney Lee took his lead to nail a game-tying jumper at the end of the second overtime.\nThe game is going to a fourth overtime, incredibly.\nAnthony’s season high had been 35 points. You can take his 45-point showing as a reminder how good he can be for teams wanting to trade for him, or a declaration that he doesn’t want to leave New York. Either way, something had Anthony as motivated as we’ve seen in months on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T01:51:25.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
