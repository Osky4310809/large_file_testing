This is the ninth main installment for the Call of Duty franchise, and was released on November 13, 2012. [3] It is the direct sequel to Call of Duty: Black Ops and was announced on May 1, 2012, during an NBA playoff game. It is the first game made by Treyarch to be set in the future, and also the first direct sequel produced for the series by the studio. \nThe game is also the first Call of Duty game for Nintendo's Wii U console, and it was available for the Wii U's launch day in North America, Europe, and Australia, whilst it was released on December 20, 2012 in Japan, which was 12 days after the console's Japanese launch day, albeit the console received the Japanese dub version simultaneously with the other platforms on the same day. \nThe link to the Call of Duty: Black Ops II website was also granted access to the public to coincide with the world reveal during the NBA basketball playoffs. Contents [ show ] Story \nThe story takes place across two separate arcs, one recounting events in the 1980s, and the other following characters in the year 2025. [4] Whilst it continues the saga of certain main characters introduced in the original Black Ops , both arcs take place several decades after the conclusion of the first game. Plot \nIn the year 2025, U.S. Special Forces operatives led by David Mason and his partner, Mike Harper , arrive at \" The Vault \", a top-security location home to an ageing Frank Woods , whom they suspect possess vital information on the whereabouts of Raul Menendez . Woods concedes that Menendez has recently visited him, and shows them a locket that the latter had left behind. Frank then narrates several covert missions undertaken during his military career which span their previous encounters. \nAccording to Woods, by 1986 Alex Mason had effectively retired from active duty to pursue an obscure existence in Alaska with his son, the seven-year-old David. Their shaky relationship is strained further when Mason is solicited by his former handler Jason Hudson , seeking to recruit him for an assignment in Cuando Cubango during the height of the Angolan civil and South African Border Wars. Woods had disappeared with his men while aiding Jonas Savimbi 's UNITA rebels against Angola's Marxist government; their actions have already been disavowed by the CIA and Hudson hopes to rescue any survivors. With UNITA's assistance, Mason and Hudson recover Woods from the Cubango, subsequently locating Menendez among a contingent of Cuban military advisers. However, a firefight breaks out, and their quarry escapes as the Americans are rescued by helicopter. It is revealed that Menendez is responsible for holding Woods captive after murdering his team. \nIn light of this information, Mason and Hudson begin tracking Menendez, who has established himself as a primary arms dealer for bush conflicts in Southern Africa and Latin America. Later in the year, the CIA authorizes a strike against the unscrupulous Nicaraguan, now making a healthy profit running arms across Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. At this point, Menendez's motive for his seemingly senseless vendetta against the West become clear: his beloved sister was grievously injured in an act of arson committed by American businessmen for insurance money. The Menendez clan, which dominates a powerful drug cartel, was again rocked by loss when the CIA sanctions the assassination of Raul's father. An embittered Menendez now considers the conflict to be personal, but his one-man struggle against the West is interrupted when Mason, Woods, Hudson, and local security forces raid his headquarters in Nicaragua; an enraged Woods inadvertently kills Raul's sister, Josefina with a grenade. \nFaking his demise with the assistance of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega , Menendez lives to retaliate against those he holds personally responsible for his sister's death. During the 1989 invasion of Panama, he kidnaps Hudson and David, using them as bait for a trap. He then uses Hudson to mislead Woods, manipulating him into shooting Mason instead of himself. Depending on the player's actions in Afghanistan, it is implied that Menendez had used moles within the CIA. In the ensuing chaos, Menendez kills Hudson and cripples Woods. Unsatisfied with his revenge, Menendez allows Woods and David to live, promising to return to complete his revenge when the time is right. \nThree decades later, Menendez re-emerges as the leader of Cordis Die, a massive populist movement with over a billion followers. He stages a cyberattack that cripples the Chinese Stock Exchange; in response, the Chinese ban the export of rare earth elements, fermenting the start of a new Cold War between the Chinese-led Strategic Defense Coalition (SDC) and the U.S.-led NATO. Taking advantage of this stand-off, Menendez attempts to bring the two powers to a full-blown war by inciting conflicts between the two, secretly aiding SDC leader Chairman Tian Zhao, who worked with Mason and Woods during their operation in Afghanistan in 1986. Using the intelligence provided by Woods, David, now a Navy SEAL Commander code-named Section, leads JSOC forces in the renewed search for Menendez. \nShortly after gathering intelligence from Woods, Section and JSOC infiltrates Myanmar investigating a spike in activity in the region. There, Section's team encounters a computer engineer under Menendez's employment, warning them of a cyberattack with a Celerium device, a quantum computer capable of hacking any computer system. Section's team is later deployed in Pakistan, attempting to gather intelligence on Menendez's plots. During the infiltration, Menendez discloses the name of a target, \"Karma\" in the Cayman Islands. Section and SEAL operatives Harper and Salazar later infiltrate the Cayman Islands, finding out that \"Karma\" is a woman named Chloe Lynch , a former employee of Menendez's shell corporation, Tacitus. Lynch was the main developer of the Celerium device, and as a means of wrapping up loose ends, Menendez had deployed mercenaries for her abduction. \nJSOC later has a lead on Menendez in Yemen, where JSOC asset Farid infiltrates Menendez's cell to help Section facilitate the leader's capture. The player, as Farid, has a choice during the mission. Menendez, suspecting Farid's disloyalty, orders him to shoot the captured Harper. If the player chooses not to shoot Harper, and instead attempts to shoot Menendez, he fails, but Harper survives and is rescued. If the player chooses to shoot Harper, Farid survives, and Harper is not present in any conversations or missions thereafter. Menendez is successfully captured, but this was a ruse for Menendez to hack into the U.S. military's computer infrastructure on the aircraft carrier the U.S.S. Obama , seizing control of the entire U.S. drone fleet. Salazar is revealed to be Menendez's mole within JSOC, and facilitates Menendez's attack—Menendez escapes with Salazar's aid, and when Menendez breaks in to the bridge of the Obama, Salazar shoots the soldiers guarding Admiral Briggs , with Lynch's survival dependent on Farid's survival in the previous mission. The player, playing as Menendez, has the choice of either killing or wounding Admiral Briggs. If the player only wounds Briggs, and the player has completed all of the Strike Force missions, JSOC and SDC enter an alliance, then the player is later informed that the SDC sent hundreds of drones to defend the Obama, and consequently Briggs was able to save the ship and its crew. Menendez uses the drones to stage an attack on Los Angeles during a meeting of G20 leaders, hoping to kill them and cause catastrophic damage to the global economy. Section escorts U.S. President Bosworth to safety amidst the drone attacks. \nJSOC eventually finds the source of the transmissions responsible for the hacking to Haiti, where Section leads JSOC forces into recapturing the facility in the final mission, and apprehending or killing Menendez. There are different endings depending on the actions the player takes throughout the campaign, such as whether or not the United States and China are able to enter an alliance with each other, as well as determining the fates of certain individuals in the game. \nDuring the main campaign, the player may choose to participate in optional Strike Missions. The Strike Missions involve JSOC attempting to curb the SDC's global influence by preventing them from forcing neighboring countries into the alliance. Section himself does not participate in these missions directly, though he can command the forces remotely from a command center. If the missions are completed successfully, the SDC is weakened enough to ally with JSOC, and assists the player later in the campaign, for example, in sending its own drones to rescue the U.S.S. Obama. Endings \nThe storyline of Call of Duty: Black Ops II has several endings depending on which conditions the player fulfills over the course of the game. \nIf the player spares Menendez's life, completes all four Strike Force Missions, and both Chloe Lynch and Alex Mason survive the events of the game, the \"best\" ending will result. The player will have secured an alliance between China and the United States, ending the Second Cold War, Chloe's survival prevents Menendez's cyberattack from succeeding, and Mason's survival allows him to visit Frank Woods in retirement, reuniting with Section. The final scene shows Menendez in prison, watching a talk show with Jimmy Kimmel interviewing Chloe, becoming frustrated and enraged when Chloe insults him during the interview. The player will be rewarded with the best ending. A tutorial of this ending can be found here . \nIf Menendez is spared and Chloe dies, but Mason is alive, he will visit Woods in \"The Vault\". But Section will not come to \"The Vault\" and see his reunion with his father. Without Chloe, Menedez's cyber-attack will succeed and he will break out of the jail and kill Woods before committing suicide. \nIf Menendez is spared and Chloe lives but Mason dies, Menedez's Cyber-Attack will fail and he will rage because of the insult Chloe said to him and finally smashing the TV with his head. Section and Woods then will visit Mason's grave and Section will declare that he is done with his military career. This ending is similar to the best ending, but Mason won't reunite with Section since he is dead. \nIf Menendez is spared, Chloe is killed and Mason's fate is unresolved, Section will apprehend Menendez and take him into custody. The cyberattack will succeed, allowing Menendez to escape from prison. He kills Woods in The Vault before visiting his sister's grave, dousing himself in gasoline, and readying a lit match. \nIf Menendez is killed, Chloe's fate is unresolved and Mason is killed, Section will visit his father's grave, ending his military career. Menendez's followers will riot when they learn of his assassination from a video Menendez programmed to post in such an event, ending with a cut of the White House burning. \nIf Menendez is killed, Chloe's fate is unresolved and Mason lives, Section will kill Menendez before reuniting with his father at the retirement home, and Menendez's followers will riot as above. Gameplay A flowchart about player choices \nDeparting from the notorious linear campaign style of past Call of Duty games, Treyarch decided to take a non-linear and sandbox approach to Call of Duty: Black Ops II , (meaning no back-to-back missions with the same outcome every time replayed) instead the old linear style has been dropped in favor of \"a more open ended campaign that relies heavily on player choice.\" \nThere will be significant points within the campaign where the player is essentially given control over the course the game will take. It won't be a simple \"A, B or C\" choice either, it will be more expansive than that. There are many more choices then just a simple live or die picking at the final mission. for example, not protecting a certain character or killing a character won't lead to a mission failure, instead it will change the course the game will take. (check out the flow chart at the right side). \nTo help with the departure from a linear campaign are a set of special missions dubbed Strike Force . These missions are sandbox, and play similarly to a Real Time Strategy game. The player can assume the role of a commander, command ground forces, and on top of this, there will be the ability to go back to the traditional first-person and take part in the action themselves. The player gets to have a chance of taking control of many different warfare technology such as unmanned vehicles, jets and robotic automobiles. If the player dies in a Strike Force mission, the story will go on, keeping the record of deaths rather than loading to the last saved checkpoint. The missions will go on to change the story, even change Menendez's plans. By the time the Cold War ends the player will see that they have made the results different. Strike Force was not well received by critics and fans, as it created a more stressful game experience. \nThe ability of diving to prone returns from the prequel, as well as the campaign's playable characters once again speaking while being controlled by the player. Furthermore, like in Call of Duty: Finest Hour , the game now features crawling animations for weapons when moving while prone (instead of the weapon simply disappearing off the screen like they did in other games).
