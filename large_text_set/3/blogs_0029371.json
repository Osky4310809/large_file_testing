This year alone, they will completely remodel 110 stores and open 30 new small-format stores in dense urban neighborhoods AND in 2018 and 2019, they will fully renovate 500 more stores.\nThe first reimagined store will be located just outside of Houston in Richmond, Texas this October. Any of you lucky Hip2Savers live near there?\nThis suburban store will have two entrances — one entrance to inspire you with displays of exclusive brands and seasonal moments and the second entrance will be all about ease with quick Order Pickup, grab-and-go food and a wine and beer shop. There have even been rumors that select Target stores will serve alcoholic beverages…\n\nFor more information on the upcoming changes and to see a few design plans, head over here .\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:01:21.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
