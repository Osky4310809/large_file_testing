But while its floral notes and clean citrus finish may have made it famous, this goat cheese—and the more than a dozen others produced at the California creamery—might owe some of their distinctive flavors to soft jazz music. Yes, jazz. \nEach day, the creamery's staff milks its 900 goats to the sounds of soft jazz, tunes that soothe the animals and block out any outside noises—such as construction on the grounds—as they stand in their parlor stanchions twice a day. The consistent music creates a calming routine for the goats, explains Ryan Andrus, the creamery's dairy director, which reduces their stress and helps yield better milk. (As Andrus explains, \"stress can lead to feed intake drops, decreased production, illness, and low immunity,\" none ideal conditions for trying to produce award-winning cheeses .) \n© Cypress Grove \nAndrus borrowed the idea from a Midwestern farm that played classical music to its pigs for their entire lives—until they were brought to slaughter, of course. The farm claimed the music kept the pigs calm and produced better-tasting pork, so Andrus adapted the idea for Cypress Grove's daily needs. \nHowever, classical music didn't suit the goats. The tunes \"had far too many swings in tempo and energy,\" Andrus says, which only served to agitate the animals. \nBut Andrus also found he couldn't play jazz music with too many horns, \"as they have an abrupt, squawky sound,\" he explains. \"That is why we can't play things like Thelonius Monk or some of the more avant-garde, creative jazz music. It has to be light, mellow, and low on intensity.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:56:33.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
