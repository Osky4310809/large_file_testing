In 1986, Mr. Cohen was the catalyst for the first three clandestine sessions in Paris and Brussels between Israeli and Palestinian representatives, two from each side. Ostensibly, those talks were limited in scope to missing or captured soldiers, but they went beyond those matters. The talks stalled when the P.L.O. refused to budge on its demand that the Soviet Union join on an equal footing with the United States in an international mediation conference, and they collapsed a few months later after Shimon Peres departed as prime minister. “Steve was the initiator of these meetings and served as the go-between,” Shlomo Gazit, one of the two Israelis and a former head of the military intelligence service, said in an email on Thursday. “The fact that Steve was Jewish did not in any way disturb the parties. Steve did not give up, and for years did his best to renew meetings and talks, unfortunately without success.” Ephraim Sneh, an Israeli politician and former deputy defense minister, described Mr. Cohen in an email as “the lone guerrilla warrior of peace.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Despite repeated setbacks, Mr. Cohen’s broad recipe for peace in the troubled region remained remarkably consistent, according to “The Go-Between,” a memoir he published last year (written with Oren Rawls), as well as other accounts. He generally favored the gradual emergence of a United Nations-mandated Palestinian state supervised by the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, though that, he wrote, would require “the gamble for peace by a great regional leader” and “the American refusal to take no for an answer.” In an interview with the Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman in 2003, Mr. Cohen said: “Israel can’t force the Palestinians to be reasonable, to pursue their interests and not their passions, but it can create a context where they are more likely to do so than not. But with its relentless settlement activity, and responding to every Hamas provocation by smashing the Palestinian Authority, Israel has not done that.” Meanwhile, Mr. Cohen said in 2002 , “it turns out Arafat wanted two Palestinian states.” “He wanted a Palestinian state for the West Bank and Gaza to be negotiated with Israel today,” he added. “And he wanted a Palestinian state inside Israel that would be brought about by a return of Palestinian refugees and their soaring birthrate tomorrow. Israel was ready to give him one Palestinian state, but not two. And Arafat didn’t have the courage to tell his people that.” Stephen Philip Cohen was born in Quebec on May 28, 1945. His father, Harry, an immigrant from Lithuania, owned an auto parts business. His mother, born in Montreal to Jewish immigrants from Romania, was a bookkeeper.
