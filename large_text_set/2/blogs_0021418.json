However, he murdered thousands more. His favored technique was called “snipping,” which he used scissors to stab the base of the baby’s skull. Gosnell kept the aborted parts, including heads, in jars scattered throughout his office building. He has been dubbed “America’s biggest serial killer” and hardly anyone even knows about him. That’s because the media has largely ignored this story. But maybe the latest development will finally make them sit up and take notice. \nThere’s a very famous actor who luckily was one of the few babies Gosnell didn’t stab after they were born, Will Smith. According to The Daily Mail , Smith’s grandmother, Helen Bright, used to work with Gosnell at a Philadelphia hospital before he opened his murder clinic. Bright’s daughter, Will’s mother Caroline, went into labor and her regularly doctor was stuck in traffic, so Bright called Dr. Gosnell to perform the delivery. \nAnd apparently Gosnell wants a gold star for not killing the Fresh Prince of Bel Air! He wrote a letter to the actor asking if he would like to help with his case and prove he’s not such a bad guy after all. But this “doctor” is so sick in the head, he actually took credit for Smith’s career: \n“I’m fond of asserting that there could never be a Men in Black if I had dropped you on your head.” \nOh, congratulations. That’s ONE we know of you let live. \nIn his letter, Gosnell referred to himself as Dr. G and implied he was the better doctor anyway to deliver the future actor. He also offered Smith’s older sister a job as executive director for his non-profit defense and education fund. \nGosnell’s horrific crimes, which includes feeding aborted remnants of children to crabs on the beaches near his Jersey Shore home, are detailed in a new book by husband and wife team Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer, known for their pro-fracking documentary Fracknation . A companion movie for Gosnell is coming soon which was one of the largest crowdfunded movies in history. It stars conservative actor Dean Cain. \nTo read Gosnell’s twisted letter to Will Smith, click CONTINUE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:33:39.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
