She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017\nTrump has previously used his Twitter to attack (and praise ) business in the past, but this is the first time he's attacked a business over its dealings with Ivanka and the first time he's amplified the tweet by retweeting it on his @POTUS account and its 15 million followers.\nYes, \"President Trump retweeted Donald Trump\" is a real yet unsurprising thing.\nThe retailer announced the move a few days ago, citing lagging sales . Both Nordstrom and a rep for Ivanka's line said earlier in the week that the decision was not political.\nAn Ivanka Trump rep told fashion website Refinery 29 , \"Nordstrom ordered both apparel and shoes for the spring, and followed through with the orders on the apparel. They canceled the shoe order, kept the apparel order and moved the apparel from online into stores. It's there.”\nThe website also spoke with a Nordstrom spokesperson who said, “This was absolutely not political — it was exclusively based on the performance of the brand... Simply put, the performance has been difficult over the past year.\"\nMashable has reached out to reps for both Nordstrom and Ivanka Trump for comment on this and the latest comment from President Trump.\nThe chain also responded to a question on Twitter, confirming the comment from Ivanka's rep about there still being items sold in store.\n@shannoncoulter Yes, we still have inventory on hand, so customers will continue to see product until it sells through.\n— Nordstrom (@Nordstrom) February 4, 2017\nStill, some saw it as a political decision because of calls for boycotts of Ivanka's brand by activists like Shannon Coulter, Quote: d in the tweet above, of #GrabYourWallet , a group that maintains a list of shops and companies connected to Trump that it urges shoppers to boycott , instead steering them toward other retailers.\nAs with other businesses who have felt the wrath of Trump on Twitter , Nordstrom saw a quick dip in its stock price when Trump's tweet hit the web. But the drop was small and the stock had rebounded within 10 minutes of the dip.\nNordstrom is hardly alone in dropping Ivanka's fashion line, as retailers like Belk and Neiman Marcus have also done so but haven't raised the online ire of the President.\nYet.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829356871848951809", "https://twitter.com/shannoncoulter", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/69ieB3lsOXNtJXJX5JIVXOK45FI=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F376694%2Faf07ee69-280c-4640-9043-5fa42697cd08.png", "https://twitter.com/Nordstrom/status/827923656848322560", "http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/11/grab_your_wallet_protest_shuns.html", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fprIf1cXjaZq5ozxmYZ5ZA2Or7A=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F376694%2Faf07ee69-280c-4640-9043-5fa42697cd08.png", "http://www.refinery29.com/2017/02/139325/ivanka-trump-line-boycotts-nordstrom", "http://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/news/a42657/nordstrom-ivanka-trump-boycott/", "https://twitter.com/Nordstrom", "http://www.npr.org/2017/02/03/513311337/nordstrom-drops-ivanka-trumps-fashion-line-due-to-lagging-sales", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3g0liy0AgSFIb1_L5sICzFU3U64=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F376647%2F0d0af647-c734-4352-be0e-479e3edfb64e.png", "https://grabyourwallet.org/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Z3ynBOe8LAaskMjiM7SNOT2nYGo=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F376647%2F0d0af647-c734-4352-be0e-479e3edfb64e.png"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T20:58:42.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
