So impressive someone decided to steal it.\nAt around 2 am Eastern time, Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan announced on his Facebook page that he’d just receive word of the crime. The company’s groundbreaking laptop wasn’t the only thing that the thief (or thieves) took, either.\nThe perpetrator(s) also made off with another Razer prototype: Project Ariana. It’s a projector, but not like any you’ve ever used before. Project Ariana is a 4K unit with a pair of depth-sensing cameras and a fisheye lens, and it’s very similar to what Microsoft showed off with their IllumiRoom concept device for the Xbox.\nHere’s what it looks like in action, courtesy of our friends over at PC Magazine :\n\nPretty sweet, right? Unlike Project Valerie — which you can only drool over for now — Razer was already planning on letting you buy Project Ariana. Though they don’t have a definite date, the projector was due to go on sale sometime later this year.\nTan is understandably ticked about the two prototypes being stolen. “At Razer, we play hard, and we play fair,” he posted, adding “our teams worked months on end to conceptualize and develop these units.”\nAuthorities are already investigating the crime, and Tan isn’t ready to rule out industrial espionage. That, he says, “is cheating, and cheating doesn’t sit well with us.”\nHe’s probably also not thrilled about history repeating itself. Back in 2011, Razer had a pair of prototypes stolen from their Bay Area offices during a break-in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T17:10:34.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
