Di Canio left Upton Park a legend (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nBut Redknapp also revealed that he used some rather bizarre tactics to keep Di Canio happy. \n\"He was high maintenance but he was a genius, he was a fantastic player,\" said Redknapp. Di Canio was high maintenance, says Redknapp (Photo: The People) \n\"I used to make sure I put him on a team in training where nobody would kick him because otherwise it would all blow up. He was volatile. \n\"He used to kick one wide and I'd used to say it was a goal. It's Paolo.
