( chasingmailboxes via Flickr ) TODAY’S DAILY DIGIT\nA somewhat subjective rating of the day’s weather, on a scale of 0 to 10.\n9/10: How does one look forward to spring after being spoiled by all this warm overwintering?\nEXPRESS FORECAST\nToday: Early morning fog, late-day isolated showers possible. Highs: 70-75\nTonight: Isolated evening showers possible. Lows: 51-56\nTomorrow: Partly sunny, light breezes. Highs: 73-77\nView the current weather conditions at The Washington Post headquarters.\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\nIf the warmth over the next three days is not enough to convince you that spring is in the air, then perhaps the chance of a thundershower on Saturday will. Even the cold push after this warmth is wimpy and unlikely to bring temperatures back down to normal levels. But since we are so spoiled this year it will seem chilly, so throw on the jacket and check out the daffodil explosion going on around town.\nToday (Thursday): Commuters take care, because some patchy fog is possible in the low-lying areas this morning. The sun should burn it all away by mid-morning, helped by light south winds. Highs shoot up to the low- to mid-70s, barely preserving the current records of 78 at Reagan National and BWI. The record of 73 at Dulles could be a goner. The warmth could spur a pop-up shower or two late in the day but nothing to break our dry spell. Confidence : Medium-high\nTonight: The chance of isolated showers lingers into the evening but clearing kicks in for the rest of the night. Winds remain light from the south. Lows reach the low- to mid-50s. Confidence: High\nFollow us on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock . Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend . . .\nTomorrow (Friday): Springtime warmth is in full force today with just scattered clouds. Light south winds do nothing to mar the feel of highs mainly in the mid-70s, not far off record levels of 78 at Reagan National and 79 at Dulles and BWI. Confidence: High\nTomorrow night: The stars shine out in a moonless sky. Evening readings remain comfortably mild in the mid-60s to near 70 given just a light south wind. Lows range through the 50s. Confidence: High\nA LOOK AHEAD\nSaturday features an approaching cold front but for now the timing looks good to allow most of us to enjoy highs in the lower 70s. Clouds increase steadily during the morning, and showers are likely to arrive by mid-afternoon. There is the threat of locally heavy downpours and even the rumble of some thunder. While nothing severe is forecast now, it bears monitoring in upcoming forecasts. Showers taper off by evening, but a gusty west wind introduces a chill. Lows plummet to the mid- to upper 30s in the suburbs and lower 40s in town. Confidence: Medium\nBright sunny skies dominate on Sunday, but cooler air pushing into the area holds highs in the low- to mid-50s. Overnight lows dip to the upper 20s to mid-30s, not quite cold enough to harm those daffodils. Confidence: Medium-high\nMonday is a tad warmer and still mainly sunny to start, but clouds are likely to increase and bring the chance for late-day showers. Highs should reach the mid- to upper 50s.
