(Photo: Jamie Squire, Getty Images) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAfter falling off the bubble, TCU might have climbed back on it with a stunning 85-82 upset of No. 1 Kansas in the Big 12 quarterfinals. \nThe Jayhawks, who have essentially locked up an NCAA tournament No. 1 seed, stormed back from a double-digit deficit to retake the lead in the game's final minutes. But the determined Horned Frogs matched the 13-time regular-season champions blow for blow and held on for the résumé-building victory. \nKansas was playing without starter, star freshman Josh Jackson, who was suspended for the opener after he backed into a parked car last month and fled the scene. A frustrated and fired-up Bill Self was whistled for a technical foul in the game. \nUSA TODAY Sports national player of the year Frank Mason III led all scorers with 29 points. TCU got a balanced offensive effort, led by Kenrich Williams' 18 points, as well as 30-plus points from players off the bench. \nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL HIGHLIGHTS Posted!
