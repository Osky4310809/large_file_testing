Rescue team members carry the three puppies found alive in the rubble of the avalanche-hit Rigopiano Hotel on Jan. 23, 2017. Alessandro Di Meo / EPA \nRescue workers were holding out hope for survivors as more than 20 guests and workers remained missing after the avalanche. Authorities raised the death toll to seven on Monday, according to the Associated Press. \nNine others have been rescued from the rubble. \nThe three rescued puppies are the offspring of Nuvola and Lupo, two sheepdogs who also lived at the hotel, officials said. The litter was born on Dec. 4. \nRelated: Italy Hotel Avalanche: Rescue Teams Hold Out Hope For More Survivors \nLupo and Nuvola managed to escape the avalanche alive, the brigade said, and were found in Farindola on Friday by a bartender at the hotel who knew the dogs well and was not working on the day of the incident. \nThe National Animal Protection Agency (ENPA) in Italy told NBC News that Nuvola and Lupo were currently with a friend of the missing hotel's owner, and they were working on getting them reunited with their puppies. \nThe hotel's owner is still missing. One of three puppies rescued from the rubble of an Italian hotel buried in an avalanche appears in a photo posted to the hotel's Facebook page before the avalanche.
