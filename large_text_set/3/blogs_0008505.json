Surely it is human nature to stop and wonder if you have hurt them? \nIf Zlatan gets a three-match ban for elbowing Mings at the corner which followed shortly after – which did look like an intentional act – I would agree with Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe that five games in the sin bin for Mings is harsh. \nWe are setting out down a very dangerous road in football if panels can make assumptions of intent when, in reality, the only person on the planet who truly knows whether Mings meant to step on Zlatan's head is Mings himself. \nAs much as we laughed off Ibrahimovic's claim that Mings jumped into his elbow, how can we actually prove otherwise?

If five games was harsh, he shouldn't be let off scot-free, either. \nWhat I'm not having is any fluff that he's “not that type of player.” That old chestnut is one of the biggest cop-outs in football. \nBournemouth said in a statement Mings had only been booked 13 times in 75 appearances, and not at all since April 2015, before his close encounter with Zlatan.
