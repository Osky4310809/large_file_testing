This particular breed can grow to weigh as much as 18 pounds, and was originally developed from species imported from Shanghai. The average boiler chicken in the U.S. weighs just under 6 pounds, according to USDA statistics.\nThe site also pegs this particular chicken as being from Kosovo, since the footage was initially uploaded to a chicken-themed Facebook group based in the country. Mashable says the larger than life bird‚Äôs name is Merakli.\nDespite the scientific explanation behind the gigantic bird, Twitter is still having a hard time processing Merakli‚Äôs existence.\nI'd like a 2,000-word explainer about that big chicken video, please.\n‚Äî Matt Ford (@fordm) March 20, 2017 \neverytime i close my eyes i see that big chicken. i cant breathe. it's all i think about\n‚Äî Swiggity Swooty (@CominForDaBooty) March 20, 2017 \nthat video of the giant chicken scares the living hell out of me\n‚Äî ‚ùÑÔ∏èsalma (@salmaguzman97) March 20, 2017 \n\nSo on second thought, it‚Äôs not so surprising that many believe Merakli is just an adult human in a chicken suit:\n@LifesBook_Ceo Bruh, this ain't no chicken.
