(AP) — Police in a Connecticut town are reminding people to not open their doors to “any unfamiliar cattle” after a pair of cows escaped from their pen and were found near the front door of a home a couple of houses away. \nSgt. Geoffrey Miner tells WGGB/WSHM a driver reported seeing the cows walking on the side of a road and in yards in Suffield on Sunday morning. \nOfficers managed to take a photo of the cows before herding them back to their pen. \nPolice posted the photo on Facebook, saying two “suspicious males” were going door-to-door “trying to sell dairy products.” They were “apprehended after a short foot pursuit.” \nPolice say the cows were able to escape due to a faulty electrical wire fence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:20:46.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
