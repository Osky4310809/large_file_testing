John Kelly for Department of Homeland Security head. \nBut Democrats are trying to slow other national security appointments from President Donald Trump in the Senate. \nFrom Free Beacon: \nDemocrats loyal to former President Barack Obama are waging a behind-the-scenes effort to undermine President Donald Trump’s national security team by blocking key appointees, according to multiple sources familiar with the outgoing administration’s efforts. \nThe centerpiece of this obstruction is the recent refusal by Senate Democrats to quickly confirm incoming CIA Director Mike Pompeo. \nDemocratic leaders—including Sens. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), Ron Wyden (Ore.), and Patrick Leahy (Vt.)—postponed Pompeo’s confirmation, claiming they need more time to debate the pick, which is widely supported by a majority of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. \nThe decision to stall Pompeo’s vote, a move that will leave the critical post of CIA director vacant as Trump takes office, is part of a wider effort by the outgoing administration and its allies to hamstring Trump on the national security front, according to multiple sources, including those close to the Trump administration. \nObama’s outgoing administration took deliberate steps to complicate and delay the building of the new Trump team, according to a veteran foreign policy insider. \n“Something strange is going on,” said the source. “It’s like the Obama national security team went out of their way to cripple the transition on the way out.” \nEven MSNBC’s Chuck Todd called Chuck Schumer out on the delay. \nThe Democrats seem to want to hold onto CIA particularly, even suggesting the Trump keep Director John Brennan, who has already quit, for the weekend. \n“Just as Director Hayden served as a bridge between the Bush and Obama presidencies eight years ago, Director [John] Brennan could play the same role for the incoming and outgoing administrations, if the President is willing to keep him on,” Matt House, a Schumer spokesman, said in a recent press statement. \nA senior congressional aide called it “playing politics” with national security. \nThey can only delay it for a few days, but what might happen in the meantime because of the pettiness?
