King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 16 hours ago 8 \nTrivium have confirmed that the reports circulating the web are true and that Alex Bent (Battlecross, Decrepit Birth) is indeed their new drummer, at least for the upcoming string of European live dates. \nBent is also known for filling in for Gene Hoglan in Testament; his live debut with Trivium will take place on February 11 in Dublin, Ireland. \nIn related news, previous Trivium drummer Paul Wandtke confirmed he was fired, telling Rock Feed : \n\"Well, it was kind of a surprise to me, but I guess it's kind of like the Avenged Sevenfold situation [with Arin Ilejay], where everything was great at first, everyone was ecstatic, we're all happy. It's kind of like getting married. You go on a honeymoon; after the honeymoon's over, things kind of get weird, and then that's it.\"Further asked on when he was officially notified his services were no longer needed, Paul replied: \"Basically, a few days ago, man. It was a mutual decision, you know.\"Frontman Matt Heafy recently stated that the band's previous three drummers - Nick Augusto (2010–2014), Mat Madiro (2014–2015) and Paul Wandtke (2015-2017) - were merely \"session players\" and not full-time members.
