Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJack P Shepherd's son was left paralysed for two days after a sudden attack of the debilitating rare illness he's had since birth. \nGreyson Milewski, whose mum Sammy Milewski fell pregnant with him six years ago after a fling with the Coronation Street star, was unable to move or talk during his Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) attack. \nThe youngster suffers from the rare neurological disorder, which causes paralysis to parts of his body and can cause unbearable pain when attacks happen. Little Greyson suffers an AHC attack on average once a month (Photo: Twitter) \nFormer model turned sales executive Sammy took to Twitter to update her followers on Greyson's progress, revealing that luckily the little boy had deemed himself \"better\" after two days of illness. \n\"My lil ones condition is too strange Last 2days he's not been able t move an talk, now he's just told me he wants t be a rock star singin & dancing,\" she tweeted. \n\"From being soo poorly to just get up an say he's better an star dancing. Couldn't be prouder of him.\" \nIt's thought Greyson has never met his father Jack, who has paid child maintenance for him since a paternity test determined he was the father. Jack has apparently never met his son (Photo: WENN) \nSammy opened up about Greyson's AHC diagnosis last summer, revealing that he takes medication every day to manage the condition. \nTaking to Twitter in July 2016, Sammy explained that she finds it tough seeing her little boy struggling. \nShe wrote: \"Hate seeing my lil dude poorly, just stopped him biting an pulling his arm saying mummy arm to go. Another arm mummy. #Hearbreaking.\" \nAlong with his daily medication, Sammy has to use a syringe to medicate Greyson during an attack, which can happen up to once a month.

She is fighting tooth and nail for Greyson.\" \nThey added: \"Sammy is strong enough to cope on her own.\" \nThe David Platt actor is already father to two children, Nyla and Reuben, with his fiancée Lauren Shippey. \nBack in 2014, Sammy opened up about her disappointment over Jack's alleged refusal to meet his son. \nShe told The Mirror: \"His father has not been in his life. I don’t know why because we don’t speak but I imagine it’s that he’s not wanted to. \n“I would like my son to have a father in his life but how can you feel sad for something he’s never had? I guess it’s sad in itself to say that.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T16:44:28.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
