It feels great committing to something that energises your body and mind because running after those taxing hours at office is not only relaxing but exhilarating as well. While it’s tempting to go out and run as fast as you can for as long as you can, you’ll ultimately run longer, feel stronger, and stay injury free if you start by adding short bouts of running to your regular walks, gradually increasing the amount of time you spend running. A photo posted by Shewali (@write_n_wander) on Dec 23, 2016 at 3:04am PST The key is to not exhaust yourself Just keep it light and do things that are easy to pursue. For instance, yesterday, I took the stairs instead of the elevator, and I brisk walked 5 km. Moreover, add one minute of running for every four minutes of walking, and gradually increase your running time so that eventually you’ll be running for twice the amount of time that you spend walking. So I ran, brisk walked and jogged, adding up to 5 km on day 1. I didn’t pressurise myself with it and just went with the flow. I started walking and slowly shifted to running. I did it as much as I could, and when I found myself panting from the run, I began to walk again. The thing is, I refused to stop until I hit 5. Other things I kept in mind Since my office is on the 7 th floor, taking the stairs even once or twice a day is good enough. So after walking almost 4,000 steps on day 1 in office, I geared up for my run in the evening. Using Fitbit, I know how many steps I'm walking, what my target is, what my heartbeat is like, and most importantly, how much fat I have burnt. Before I started running, my resting heart beat was 71, and when I ended my run, it was around 140. It’s too technical to gauge, but I like to see how the body reacts when I am resting and when I am on the go. \nThe mighty day ended with a good run, some 12,000 steps, letting go of nearly 2,300 calories, and a lot of perspiration. One thing I love about using this gadget is that it tells me exactly how many calories I have burnt, thus, presenting a stark comparison with my intake. \nCalorie control is so important because if you eat more calories than you burn, you gain weight, and if you eat fewer calories than you burn, you lose weight. \nWith Fitbit, I know exactly how much I have burnt and hence can identify the correct amount of healthy food that I need to eat to keep myself running. But what I love the most about this gadget is that it tells me every tiny detail about my day. If I forget to walk after an hour, it buzzes, and I am instantly reminded of the walk that I need to take. I am going to improvise more as I use the Fitbit band. *waiting for a super-healthy transformation* But it's easier said than done I have to plan my entire day to just fit 'an hour' for a daily run. Getting up early in the morning to cook, coming home slightly early to prepare for the next day, and staying away from junk food has already begun to take a toll on the way I function every day. I feel a little rushed, and I'm having a hard time adjusting to these newly acquired habits. Let's see if the next week brings with it any progress in this department, as well as in my ability to run. just in ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:57:44.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
