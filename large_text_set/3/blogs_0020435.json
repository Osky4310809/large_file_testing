Philstar.com, File/Department of Finance, released MANILA, Philippines —The Bureau of Internal Revenue on Wednesday filed a P9.56-billion tax evasion case against cigarette firm Mighty Corp for allegedly using fake internal revenue stamps. The BIR filed the case against the cigarette manufacturer and its officers for allegedly violating National Internal Revenue Code of 1987 or the Tax Code, specifically sections 263 and 265. The charges came after the BIR and the Bureau of Customs confiscated and seized thousands of cigarette packs with fake stamps during an inspection in Cebu. The BOC also seized P2 billion worth of Mighty Brand cigarettes with fake stamps in Pampanga, as well as from a warehouse in General Santos City.
