However, “Superstore” landed an early Season 2 renewal , after performing well — and better than “Telenovela.” Even with its star-power in Eva Longoria, “Telenovela” was also the lower rated of the two. During its winter run on Mondays, it averaged a 1.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 4.4 million viewers overall in Nielsen’s “live plus-7” estimates. \n“Crowded” has also been cancelled. The multi-camera family comedy debuted midseason. \nPatrick Warburton, Carrie Preson, Miranda Cosgrove and Mia Serafino starred on the half-hour laffer, which had many episodes directed by comedy vet James Burrows. The series is about a married couple who are new empty nesters, until their grown-up graduated daughters unexpectedly move back home. \nThough it retained most of its “The Carmichael Show” lead-in during its run on Sundays this spring, “Crowded” averaged a modest 1.0 rating in adults 18-49 and a little over 4 million total viewers in Nielsen’s “live plus-3” estimates. \nRick Kissell contributed to this report.
