That man, Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, 28, was charged with conspiring to commit money laundering. \nTelexFree had few customers and made most of its revenue from people buying into the company with a promise of payouts for posting online ads for it, prosecutors have said. They were paid with money from new recruits, often friends and family of earlier investors. \nAlthough initially aimed at Brazilian immigrants to Massachusetts, authorities allege almost 1 million people worldwide were swindled out of nearly $1.8 billion. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
