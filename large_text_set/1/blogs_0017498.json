These engineers recently volunteered to showcase Disney’s history of innovation during Otronicon, a STEM-focused event at the Orlando Science Center.\nThis annual event is designed to inspire local students to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. It was awesome to see these future scientists connect with Disney VoluntEARS who demonstrated how we’ve pushed the boundaries of creativity to bring theme park attractions to life – including the use of Pepper’s Ghost effect at Haunted Mansion to the latest advances used to bring Seven Dwarfs Mine Train to life. My favorite by far was a 3-D model of Pandora – The World of Avatar opening this summer to Disney’s Animal Kingdom with its awe-inspiring land of floating mountains and bioluminescent rainforests.\nCheck out this video to see more.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:22:13.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
