Advertisement \nThe documents state that following the close of Yahoo’s $4.8 billion sale to Verizon—which, by the way, is still up in the air —Mayer and several other members of the board will resign. The filing also take pains to emphasize that the departures are not “due to any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.” \nBesides Mayer, David Filo, Eddy Hartenstein, Richard Hill, Jane Shaw, and Maynard Webb all plan to resign from the board. In addition, the board intends to rename the shell of Yahoo Altaba Inc., which will certainly join the sad exclamation point in Yahoo’s Hall of Unfortunate Nomenclature.
