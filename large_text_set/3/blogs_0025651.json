Jones did not however, offer any apologies to Clinton, Podesta or their campaign. Alex Jones apologized Friday for Infowars' role in spreading \"Pizzagate.\" (via youtube/The Alex Jones Channel) \n“I made comments about Mr. Alefantis that in hindsight I regret, and for which I apologize to him,” he said, reading from a written statement. “We relied on third-party accounts of alleged activities and conduct at the restaurant. We also relied on accounts of reporters who are no longer with us.” \nHe continued: “To my knowledge today, neither Mr. Alefantis nor his restaurant Comet Ping Pong, were involved in any human trafficking as was part of the theories ...” \nThe Pizzagate conspiracy theory was thrust into national headlines when Edgar Maddison Welch in December entered Comet Ping Pong armed with an assault rifle. His intention was to “self-investigate” the sex trafficking ring he believed was operating under top Democratic leaders. A fake news story prompted a man to fire a rifle inside a popular Washington, D.C., pizza place as he attempted to \"self-investigate\" a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring from there. (Jose Luis Magana/AP) \nAlex Jones praised as 'a hero' by pro-Putin commentator \nJones said Infowars has removed “the majority of broadcasts and videos” that reference Pizzagate and asked for the forgiveness of the site’s viewers. \n“I want our viewers and listeners to know that we regret any negative impact our commentaries may have had on Mr. Alefantis, Comet Ping Pong or its employees,” he said. “We apologize to the extent our commentaries could be considered as negative statements about Mr. Alefantis or Comet Ping Pong, and we hope that anyone else involved in commenting on Pizzagate will do the same.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:12:45.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
