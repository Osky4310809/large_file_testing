Merkel asks Trump: “Do you want to have a handshake?”The U.S. president did not respond. https://t.co/dgLHkN1H7o pic.twitter.com/ChonvrLITV \n— POLITICO (@politico) March 17, 2017 \nAt a joint press conference, Trump spoke about his concern that all members of NATO pay their share. \n“I reiterated to Chancellor Merkel my strong support for NATO as well as the need for our NATO allies to pay their fair share for the cost of defense,” Trump said. \n“ Many nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States,” Trump continued. “These nations must pay what they owe.” \nNATO nations have pledged to spend 2 percent of the GDP on defense, in response to Trump’s call for them to spend more on defending Europe. Germany currently spends 1.19 percent of its GDP on defense. \n“We held a conversation where we were trying to address also those areas where we disagree, but we tried to bring people together … [and] tried to find a compromise that is good for both sides,” Merkel said of her talk with the president, adding it was “much better to talk to one another than about one another.” \nTrump said he and Merkel are seeking a “peaceful solution” to the conflict in Ukraine, adding, “Our two countries must continue to work together to protect our people from radical Islamic terrorism.” What do you think?
