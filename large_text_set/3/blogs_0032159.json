McClean popped down to Londonderry to take on the Bulls (Photo: Kevin Morrison) McClean posed with his rivals after the match (Photo: Kevin Morrison) Read More Martin O'Neill backs James McClean to pay fitting tribute to pal Ryan McBride with big performance against Wales \n\"To be honest I thought it was one of those fake accounts, that somebody was taking the hand out of me. \n\"He said: 'I'm playing a match on Tuesday night, I'll be back in Derry at lunchtime on Wednesday - how does that sound?'\" \nMcClean managed to persuade former Derry City player Vincent Sweeney, current Coleraine striker Jordan Allan and his brother Brian to turn out for the specially created James McClean Select XI. \nThe kind-hearted midfielder had played for his country less than 24-hours earlier, losing 1-0 to Iceland, before the extra special match. McClean had played for Ireland the night before (Photo: PA) \nMorrison added on Facebook : \"The Oxford Bulls played their first friendly match against a strong James McClean Select team, captained by Republic of Ireland international James McClean himself. \n\"Our boys were a bit star struck when he first walked in, but after James put them through their paces in the warm-up, they were ready to take him on. \n\"So I just want to say a huge thank you to James McClean and his mates for coming down to see our lads today and giving them their first big game experience. \n\"The lads are still buzzing and our Adam is still a little Star-struck. McClean has played 47 times for his nation (Photo: Sportsfile) McClean has starred in the Baggies midfield this season   Reuters / Matthew Childs) \n\"I don't think James will ever appear in a more chaotic team photo as he did today, and yet he handled it with all such great patience and grace. So thank you James and co. for a most memorable day.\" \nAfter a tightly-contested in-door game, McClean went in goal to face a series of penalties - but failed to save a single effort. \nClubs are now queuing up to take on the Bulls - with Manchester City, Everton and Liverpool among the outfits who have offered a tournament.
