Peter Sterling doubts the Broncos and Bulldogs will make the top eight. Source: News Corp Australia \n“I think they’ll be giving a head start,” Sterling told Triple M. “I don’t think they’ll make the eight this year.” With a number of departures over the off-season, Sterling believes the only way they will fire is if halves Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt are at their absolute best. \n“I think that Corey Parker will be a big loss,” Sterling said. “That will see them rely on a lot of young forwards coming through - Pangai Junior, Jai Arrow - these kinds of players like Herman Ese’ese.” \nNRL PREDICTED ROUND 1 TEAMS \nConversely, the Bulldogs haven’t missed the finals since Des Hasler arrived at the club in 2012, but Sterling is becoming weary of a stale attack. Canterbury were knocked out by Penrith in the opening week of last year’s finals series when they finished the season with four losses. \n“I don’t think they’ll be playing finals football for the first time under Des Hasler,” Sterling said. \n“I just think their style of play hasn’t improved in the last couple of years well enough to stay with some of the sides that have improved their style of play. \n“I still think there’s a question mark in the combination between (Moses) Mbye and Josh Reynolds in the halves.” \nMeanwhile, Sterling labelled Penrith as his favourites for the minor premiership while suggesting last year’s champions, Cronulla, could be left fighting for a spot at the bottom of the eight.
