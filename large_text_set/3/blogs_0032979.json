For Cara Delevingne, who debuted a silver-blonde bob haircut earlier this month, the change preempts a major career move.\nIn an interview with USA Today published this week , the actress revealed that she chopped her hair into a cropped platinum bob because she’ll be shaving her head for her next role .\n“I have to shave my head for my next part, so I have to do something different,” she said. “So I dyed it. Just for fun. Just to change it up.” OMG! Bald Cara! We’re counting down the days until the release of Life in a Year , her next movie (or at least until she debuts the ~big change~).\nJeffrey Mayer/WireImage/Getty Images Delevingne is no stranger to dramatic hair switch-ups. The previously long-haired brunette cut her locks into a honey-colored lob — that’s a “long bob” — last summer, freshening up her look and inspiring us to chop off our own long strands.\nDavid M. Benett/Getty Images for Burberry And she’s not alone in her close-cropped, work-related cut, either. Actress Kristen Stewart stepped out with a bleach blonde buzz cut earlier this month and stunned fans, but revealed that the dramatic chop was for her role in the forthcoming film Underwater , in which she plays a mechanical engineer aboard a submarine. She explained on the Today Show that the decision was practical, since she’ll be wearing a helmet for the role.\nMark Sagliocco/FilmMagic/Getty Images “I’m not going to have touch-ups once I got the helmet on,” she said. “[Plus], I’ve been wanting to do this for a long time, just for novel’s sake … The producer suggested it and I said, ‘That’s a great idea! I am game!'”\nYour move, Cara!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:40:38.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
