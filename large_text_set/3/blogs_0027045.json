It also means we can protect ourselves from the spread of infection. Hormonal contraception enables us to control our periods, and even prevent pregnancy after sex has taken place.\nIn short, it’s a miracle.\nSo why is it that 52% of men (according to an American study conducted by PerryUndem) don’t feel that they’re getting any benefit out of free contraception for women.\nPerhaps these men feel that because they don’t pop the pill themselves, it doesn’t affect them.\nWhile it’s frustrating to think that men could be so dismissive of a medication that allows both parties to enjoy sexual freedom, it’s not entirely surprising.\nPicture: Getty Access to contraception means that women are able to remain in the workforce. Birth control is estimated to account for more than 30 percent of the increase in the number women in skilled careers from 1970 to 1990.\nContraception means that unwanted pregnancies are reduced, resulting in less need for social care. Children in the US conceived in areas with better access to contraception were 2 to 7 percent more likely to attain 16 or more years of education.\nAccording to a study by Planned Parenthood, ‘Being able to get the pill before age 21 has been found to be the most influential factor in enabling women already in college to stay in college’.\nHumans are fundamentally selfish, and perhaps it’s hard to see how women having better educational opportunities and career prospects would improve your life if you don’t run the risk of becoming pregnant.\nPicture: Getty Even if the argument that women’s access to contraception improves society on a macro level, look at it on a personal level.\nIt takes two to tango, and babies are not conceived by women alone. If you have sex with someone and they become pregnant, you are they liable to pay child support. According to the Child Poverty Action Group, the average cost of raising a child from birth to the age of 18 is £172,694.\nIf you have sex with someone and they become pregnant, you are they liable to pay child support. According to the Child Poverty Action Group, the average cost of raising a child from birth to the age of 18 is £172,694.\nHalf of £172,694 is £86,347. Meaning that every time you risk your sexual partner becoming pregnant you run the risk of incurring a financial penalty more than the price of a new Porche.\nIs your tax money paying for a woman to take the pill starting to sound a little more appealing now?\nMore Allure magazine's April issue is the most beautiful celebration of diversity \nGoat yoga has finally come to Europe and we're besides ourselves with excitement \nHave you been a victim of zombieing - the latest dating trend? \nDenying that men benefit from contraception would be like women complaining that there’s no point in screening for prostate cancer. Just because it doesn’t directly affect you doesn’t mean you don’t benefit from it.\nPerhaps those men who don’t think that they benefit from women having access to free birth control should demonstrate just how strongly they feel by exclusively paying for and using condoms?\nMORE: Taking the Pill can ease period pains \nMORE: Contraception: Popping the pill question ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:06:54.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
