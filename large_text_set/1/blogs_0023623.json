Today, we have also given cash and gifts to about half a dozen widows,” she said. \nEarlier same day also, the group visited the Isolo General Hospital where they gave out gifts items to the first baby of the day, being their Founder’s day. Olasanya and her team were received by the Deputy Medical Director of the hospital, Dr Femi Adeyanju, and the Chief Matron.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:51:45.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
