Maria Kanellis heading back to WWE? Photo: WWE.com \nFormer WWE Superstar Maria Kanellis and her husband Mike Bennett may be heading to the WWE. \nAccording to a new report from the Wrestling Observer ( via SE Scoops ), the pair have been ‘“very secretive” about where they are taking their talents next, which typically indicates WWE. \nThis moves comes after Mike and Maria’s year run with Impact Wrestling, where they captured the Knockouts and X-Division Championship respectively, before officially departing from the company in February. \nMaria worked for the WWE from 2004 to 2010, debuting as part of the first televised Diva Search. She would later debut in Ring of Honor in late 2011 alongside Bennett, who was with ROH since 2008. \nWould you like to see Maria and Mike in the WWE? How would you book their return/debut? Who would you like to see the pair feud with? Let us know in the comments below! The Wrap (Febuary 25th, 2017): News from the week in women’s wrestling YonceLuvsDivas \nWell I guess The Bella’s are mad lol. All the women they so called blocked a contract from all basically either returned or returning this year. But it’ll be cool to see Maria back. I’d like her to continue with the character she had on TNA. Can you imagine the promos she could have with Steph and Charlotte. Oh those would slay my life. howie_ruhl \nYes please. And there is always that dynamic of her being a non-wrestler coming into play. She’s very good at making people want to smack her just before she manages to get away without a scratch. AllLashes \nShe made the Allie character whatever it became. She can help other girls get over. YonceLuvsDivas \nRight. I wanted to slap Maria so bad in TNA and it irked me when she got away free. Man she played the hell out that character. Dylan Gutierrez \nIf only Stephanie would allow a female to go over but knowing her pattern, she’d bury Maria or anyone else than isn’t Trish or Lita/Sable. Maddox \nNot possible, Steph is already doing that so Maria would always look beneath her K. W. M. \nHonestly? No! There is now the so called womens revolution and now all the old divas suddenly want to come back to jump across the board? To harvest what they have not build up? AllLashes \nThese same old divas have said time and time again they fought for more TV time, more opportunities, gave ideas but management didn’t listen. \nI’m here for everyone, wrestlers only aren’t gonna make them money and Maria is a proven name in the industry. K. W. M. Boris. \nMaria and Kelly were both more popular than Katie or Jillian so I don’t see why you would even question that choice. But like I said, I’m all for any of them returning if it means another chance to show what they got. K. W. M. \nBecause Katie and Jillian were not given any chance! They would deserve another run. Not those who already had it. \nNeither was Maria, but that can be said for any woman of that era, even the ones who won multiple titles. I’m all for anyone to return if it means them getting a second chance. K. W. M. \nThe thing is what do they have to give? if Maria is not returning in ring, then i’m ok with it. If she returns to wrestle then she should go through the Performance Center like anyone else. ralfikh \nRight! These 3 women been booked very lame.. Jillian is really good wrestler if wwe gave her worthy gimmick.. Katie Lea she got the whole package she need a second run w wwe(ladder match probably).. Victoria could be champion several time during her run w the new women at the time but no they use her as enhance talent.. Mark \nI’d rather have Maria come back and take up a spot with her flawless mic skills and ability to play characters then sit through Billie Kay and Peyton Royces basic matches and promos. Dionte Brown \nS too much truth. Maria was great in her role in tna. I always thought she sucked as a wrestler but when I heard her on the mic I was blown away. I knew it was scripted and she still made me want to punch her lol K. W. M. \nWhat have Billie or Peyton, besides that they both are better in everything than Maria, to do with the post? Mark \nNothing childish about my comment. You have Billie and Peyton in your avatar who have been the poster girls for “generic” and “basic” since their NXT debuts yet you don’t want Maria back who may not be able to wrestle but can really add something to one of the brands with her awesome mic and acting skills. K. W. M. \nIt is childish, you disagree with what i say and you coume up with bashing my faves. And luckily the people here see it different, thats why people here love them and especially Peyton is a possible future star in the eyes of the diva dirt users, but it is not the first time you do that. Kinda trolling! \nI’ve always thought he was a troll… ? K. W. M. \nI remember him throwing such comments around, but i was not sure. So i replied to it, but it looks you are right :/ Mark \nMeh. It may come off childish or whatever I just think it’s dumb how you don’t want someone who can bring a very strong character to the table to return but you’re OK with Billie and Peyton’s basic performances. But whatever. \nLma you are so biased. LaurenYorkStan \nUmmm excuse me??? They are the ones who opened the door for this revolution…do not be disrespectful to the ladies who laid down the foundation for your faves to be successful K. W. M. \nIn what way have Kelly or Marie laid foundation for my faves to be succesful? DivaFactz \neverything the women of today are getting, women from the past fought hard to get. So it’ll be rewarding for women like Mickie, Melina, Michelle and so many others from that era to come back and get another run and get exactly what they so desperately asked for. They deserve it! K. W. M. \nSo you think it is fair when the old ones are coming back, stealing spotlight from the current females who made themselves a name now? ralfikh \nFor me w/o the past wont b the present John Finnie \nWwe are trying to find a balance with female talent wrestlers valets it’s what worked in the past & wwe love the past D<3 \nmaria is basically coming back to manage mike her husband. Nathan Bootleg Kardashian \nOkay but I thought she quit wrestling all together to focus on her education??? jcott3 \nAccording to Wikipedia (consider the source), Maria is slated to graduate from Johnson & Wales University in May. \nlol. If WWE comes calling you…idc if you’re a freaking Harvard student, you drop everything and say yes. ? jcott3 \nVery true. Wasn’t Kelly Kelly a freshman in college when John Laurinaitis tracked her down and offered her a job? Nathan Bootleg Kardashian \nNo hate, she’s just said multiple times on twitter that she was going can to peruse her educatiom haha MK126 \nIm pretty sure she said that cause Dixie Carter was in charge of TNA cause as soon as Jeff came back on board she said she wasn’t leaving LOL Sam \nGood god no. Please don’t go back the E. Should’ve just stayed in ROH. Sass. \nMike Bennett is fantastic, and I think he deserves a shot in WWE. Him and Maria have great chemistry on-screen together. I wouldn’t be opposed to having Maria back. She’s really stepped up her promo game. I think she’d only occasionally wrestle, and be nowhere near the title. Hoooshi \nI would like to see her back as a manager, either to Mike or someone else, she’s great on the mic. As a wrestler, though? No, thanks. MK126 \nBennett will probably join NXT if he says yes which means Maria will be apart of the NXT roster which means she can get proper training at the PC instead of what she got at FCW. Like the supposed report of K2 signing a deal and being sent to PC before going to the MR im ok with \nFCW wasn’t around when Maria was coming up. MK126 \nDid she train at DSW? Don Prima \nYeah. Only training facilities available were OVW and FCW. I don’t think Maria trained at either too. Doni Potter \nMaria trained at ovw. She was also once apart of their booking team and this is where’s she and punk met when they started dating Sebastián Muñoz LeWoman \nWhile I was never a fan of Maria the wrestler, I have to respect Maria the person herself. She is very woke and aware on issues in the world, and speaks up unlike most other female wrestlers. She is also capable of playing a character and speaking on the mic. (Which she in fact does better than any women hired by WWE rn) I’d much rather have her over Kelly Kelly. But if they’re going to have Maria wrestle, then please have her go through the hurdles at Performance Center. Maria was improving and getting decent in 2007/2008 but then regressed so much and her run on SD was so bad wrestling wise. LaurenYorkStan \nY sss Jorge Hernandez Moran \nI agree with what you said about Maria my only problem with her besides the wrestling us that she seems to like to slut shame other women Luiz Giem \nI know this is just a rumor but OMG, YES PLEASE! \nMike is a great athlete and deserves a WWE run and Maria is a very interesting character as manager so it would be nice to have her back along with her husband. Raichu \nWould love this. Heel Maria would be interesting in WWE. Dreignz \nYes #BrieForPeace ? \nI can’t wait if this is true. Imho she was very underrated and never got to live to her true potencial. She was so over as a babyface and had this fire inside her and kept upping her game despite not being the best wrestler. With the PC she can only get better and finally prove haters wrong Spiteful Dark Angel #ABliss \nhum delete right now martin rioux \nIf she does that same type of character she’S been playing in TNA, then i say why not. Maryse is pretty much copying her anyway, why not bring the original version to WWE and start a feud with miz and maryse. 3 \nHopefully as a manager. And manager only . She’s great on the mic but it stops there . . ? \nhERE SHE COMES AGAISBN LEIKE GOOD MEDCINDIDINE EVERY STEP SHE TAKES mY HEARt IS flOOOO WWWINGGG saul de la efe \nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LMAO howie_ruhl \nAs a manager for Mike: yes. Let’s face it, the girl can talk. It would be interesting to see though how they plan to work around the fact that she was once this sweet, innocent and dumb girl. Perhaps they can work that in a storyline? Have her confess that she once had to dumb herself down just to fit in when apparently she is smarter than she seems? I mean, they do have material for that right? Like when she surprisingly collected her thoughts well enough to lambaste Bischoff? Gabriella Panajotova \nThey’ll gloss over it, noone really would care anyways. In her late days with the company she suddenly got smart and nobody bated an eye :D HOLLA \ni hope so. despite many people she feelings, Marian has proven to be hard working and passionate to the business. Pearlita Marie McGee \nIf Alexa Bliss can be champion, so can Maria. Gabriella Panajotova \nLMAO, as if there is any substance in what you’re saying. They can’t really be compared. Kessa Kez \nalexa’s punches are cringeworthy. you’d think she’d have learnt how to throw a decent punch but no. LaurenYorkStan \nNo there not her punches looks legit specially compared to others Mark \nAlexa still needs time to improve but gir … Just no. Love Maria but she can barely take a back bump and can’t even execute a clean looking clothesline. Alexa is a great wrestler just needs more time to learn ring psychology. Not everyone “gets it” quick like McCool did LaurenYorkStan \nAs a manager only, that should suffice. Kvngbalor \nIll pass tbh if were bringing back past divas and it’s the trend give us Victoria give us Jazz give us Kharma give us Melina not another women who will valet rarely wrestle be casted on TD to feud with Bellas then repeat the Miz Maryse Nikki John feud months later cause we all know that’s where all this would lead to ThePeaceVibe. \nMy thoughts exactly.. I’ll take Jazz, Melina, Victoria, Gail over the Kelly’s & Maria’s. LaurenYorkStan \nBut some of those women you listed might not be as good as they was before I know Melina is but the others will need just as much training as the so called past “model divas” Kvngbalor \nYou tried it i almost didn’t reply Victoria is still in top notch shape and Jazz and Kharma are still working indies you can’t be serious Jazz and her husband actually have a school LaurenYorkStan \nBut as good as they once were…..I would love to see them back jcott3 \nJazz is part of the big concussion lawsuit against WWE, so don’t get your hopes up. \nVictoria is 46 and would probably be used the same way she was the last 2 years of her WWE run: to build up and put over the next generation. That and she may not want to work a full-time schedule. While she was in TNA, she only did TV and PPV’s – no house shows. Gabriella Panajotova \nMike is a talented guy and definitely deserves a shot in the WWE. Maria has been a great manager for him, so I’d be all for them going there. Just keep Maria away from the ring. Maddox \nWonder how far he can go there though, Too big to be a cruiserweight and also not a world champion material \nWould rather see someone else from the past, but whatever if she is just in a roll like Maryse or Lana. Miguel Orona Rodríguez \nIf you think this women doesn’t love wrestling than you are blind. She isn’t the best wrestler and she might not be in par with the talent today but she’s really good for wrestling TV. She’s never failed with her characters, the “dumb” Maria she played so well, the underdog Maria or the First Lady Maria. All of them worked, she got great reactions always. \nI would be amazinly happy if Maria ever shows up again at WWE. At her time she was one of my favorites and now her husband needs her, she’s that superstar element to him. I would love to see her interactions with Mickie, The Bella Twins & Maryse since they know each other so well. #Hooligan ? \nI’m interested in seeing Maria and Mike in WWE. wwepassion \nPlease have her go to NXT for at least a year and a half or something. Gato_wiska \nMaria should Bully Bayley…… She can make her very over. aldo \nAs a heel manager, but not as a wrestler, please. hitesh khanna \nYES!! SHE DESERVES IT.. I can’t tell you, how much I couldn’t stand her in the last years of her WWE run, but when I saw her at IMPACT and saw her husband, dang there both on FIRE. like it or not but they both are fire on mic, hes actually a good wrestler, researched his indys, roh videos, and there both a hot couple.. Def love to see them at NXT, we need a female talented valet who can make her husband do wonder in NXT Mark \nShe’s ready. She’s ready to slay these basic bitches on the mic. I’m ready for her segments with Summer Rae and dreaming about them ? Pearlita Marie McGee \nAnother person for Nikki to feud with over reality TV drama? LaurenYorkStan glassjaw \nNo, genuinely curious. \nI mean, Maria opened the can of worms with the whole blocking contracts accusations to begin with. Now Maryse has used the fabled dirt as ammunition on TV. \nListen, I think Mike Bennett is an incredible talent. He wholeheartedly deserves to be in WWE. Bring in Maria too; just keep her away from the ring is all I ask! \nLmao so true considering the rumors got started by Maria. Wrestling.fan.from.France \nThat’s the first thing I thought about lol CheapPops \nLast I heard Nikki and Maria made amends so I don’t think they’re gonna go down that route. Wrestling.fan.from.France \nIt’s WWE so you never know.. CheapPops \nYou got me there. I just don’t think it would make much sense since her claims would be proven wrong if she got signed to WWE. Edwards1992 \nNow all we need Cody and Brandi to come back. \nSmack down can have Miz and Maryse and Maria and Bennett.. \nAnd on raw Russev and Lana, Cody and Brandi LaurenYorkStan \nShe reminds me of someone who loves art and musicals and would have a divine time at Broadway shows in this pic https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/aad9775b52fd0dd88ffe9397ff9c54a5465d857cff4547726a41a4b26d245ffd.png Spiteful Dark Angel #ABliss LeBoss \nLove Maria now more than ever. She could’ve used her fame to go to Hollywood like most but she showed her true passion for the business by staying and continuing to improve. There’s no doubt in my mind if she went back to WWE hopefully on the same show as Bliss, their verbal exchange would be borderline iconic Timalee \nI’ll be honest, I don’t watch TNA and haven’t since around time Tara debuted. So whatever someone does in TNA, is oblivious to me. I kinda like it that way, cause then there’s a clean slate. We also should all know by now that, just because someone had a very successful run in one wrestling business, doesn’t mean they’ll do great in another. All depends on writers and if the crowd backs them up. \nDo I want to see Maria in the WWE again? Eh, I won’t be mad, but I also won’t be completely thrilled about it. If she does come back, I’d prefer her to, one, stay out of the ring competition. Two, stay out of the main feuds and title pictures. Unless if she has improved great leaps when it comes to her in-ring skills, then maybe, but even then I still don’t want to see her holding any title. If WWE was going to give her a title, the divas title would had been that title. These new titles (even though right now the Raw one is kind Blah to me cause of it’s booking) she doesn’t need to be part of. \nNow women who I think should come back and get a second chance and gain more of a legacy are: Kharma: It was like the biggest hype for women’s wrestling in a long time. Especially when she came back for Rumble. I think Kharma needs to come back and have a full run in WWE. Cause she deserves it and right now would be a better crop of women for her to work with. Gail Kim: Okay, I know the likely hood of this happening is little to not gonna happen. Especially after her 2nd run in the WWE. But I think WWE is at a better place with their women’s division that, her coming back would be good for the division and she can finally have like a legitimate run in WWE and hold multiple title reigns. Victoria: Let’s face it, it would be epic for her to return. The last couple years of her run in WWE was not but jobber and comedy clown. I think Victoria needs to come back and re-establish her dominance and have some runs at one if not both titles. Kaitlyn: It would be nice to have her back. She was my favorite and I felt her run was cut way too short. I feel she’d work great with this crop of women and can have much success with the titles. AJ Lee: Even though this is another very unlikely return, it’d be nice. She was very successful when it came to her first run. I feel she’d be a great add on to today’s girls. If this was to ever happen, I don’t want WWE to rely on her as crutch as much as they did in her first run. Cause they sure did over do her a lot. Cherry: Was released way too soon. Just when she was getting better and improving so much and I’m sure within another year she’d be good enough to had been in the title picture, especially with Maryse. I know it’s a very big long shot if her ever to return to WWE, but i’d love to see her come back even if it’s as a valet. daniel maldonado \nbit of off topic news but it looks like wwe might be moving emma & summer to smackdown. i wouldnt mind seeing maria back and i think bennett shouldve signed with wwe in the first place rather than going to tna. CheapPops \nAs long as she doesn’t wrestle I’m all for her being back. Wrestling.fan.from.France \nTruth be told : she is indeed a great talent. She knows her strengths and her weakness and is a great mic worker. Not to mention; her ability to play a heel character is great. Seeing more female managers is a great thing, with Lana, Maryse and possibly Maria, that would be very cool. Now, I am ONLY here for her possibly returning if it is exclusively about her working as a non-wrestling character (unless it is for some very rare big occasions). Her value as a wrestler is obviously non-existent. brimode \nIf they do come to the WWE, I want them in NXT. They’d fit in perfectly and we’ve never had a power couple in NXT, whereas we’ve got Maryse/Miz and Cena/Nikki on SD (as well as Carmella/James) and RAW has Rusev/Lana. So, I’d love them on NXT. Ronnieboi_M \nI feel like WWE are bringing back certain female superstars as a way to keep star power in case the Bella’s can’t be there. Like all the women that were offered Total Divas season one, are coming back allegedly. I’m not complaining though. LOVED all these girls. Even though I’m happy with the current roster, there’s always room for more. B1G_FaN \nMaria can feud with Eva Marie in the battle of the red heads with no wrestling talent! Edwards1992 \nhttps://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/86d589059dc2b7fed5e5f20c33694b803af00639b9b55a6adf6f423601fe8517.gif ?too litty? \nI’m surprised Diva Dirt hasn’t reported about the rumors of Victoria making her return to the WWE as well. MeddlingDiva \nh hell n . Keep her away from the ring. NXT probably needs an female backstage reporter lol Addy \nMaria and Kelly Kelly should like, stay away.
