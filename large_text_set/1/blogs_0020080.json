In fact, I think morning people are probably demons sent from hell to torment me during my weakest moment. The worst part of my day is waking up . Thankfully there’s coffee, a hot, delicious, caffeinated beverage sent from heaven to fight off morning demons. To prove that coffee is a gift from the gods, here are five things that are great about coffee. Antioxidants! \nCoffee is just full of antioxidants. I’m not totally sure what antioxidants do, but other people tend to talk about them and how great they are. Protection against cirrhosis of the liver \n(source) \nSure you’re thinking, “But I don’t drink that much.” It doesn’t matter — cirrhosis can get those that have never had a drop of alcohol. It’s like a bully just looking for a weak liver to beat up on. Thankfully our good friend coffee has your back. Coffee’s been shown to lower liver enzymes (and it's also great for a hangover). Lowered risk of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s \n(source) \nMy grandmother had Alzheimer’s, which is not a fun way to go (although she did forget that she smoked and that’s how we got her to quit). Anyways, studies have shown that people who drink coffee are less likely to get either Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, which for me is reason enough to drink a pot a day. Black coffee prevents cavities \nCoffee (but only black coffee, no cream or sugar) kills off the bacteria in your mouth that causes tooth decay. Finally, you can quit brushing your teeth and just have perpetual coffee breath. Who needs friends anyways? Reduces suicide \n(source) \nA study from Harvard found that drinking between two and four cups of coffee a day reduces suicides by up to 50 percent. I have no idea how they measured that, but Harvard seems like a smart place, so I’ll believe them. I also get it — every morning I wake up with no will to live until I get some coffee in me, and then I can see possible good things about living. Coffee also works as a mild antidepressant, so let’s all start self medicating! \nDo you have any odes to coffee?
