That’s how the Colorado No-Call List works. \nTelemarketers must pay the state for that list and then ensure workers do not call those phone numbers. \nFees generated by the list totaled $107,545 in 2016 for the Colorado Public Utilities Commission. The money is going back into the program, said Terry Bote, a PUC spokesman. \n“The money from the telemarketer fees is used to pay the third-party vendor for administration of the Colorado do-not-call program. The vendor ( Data Protection Group ) takes complaints by phone or website. The Attorney General’s office handles enforcement of the program,” Bote explained in an e-mail.

The FTC also takes complaints (at ftccomplaintassistant.gov ) and handles enforcement. In 2013, the FTC made its largest settlement for violators of the list. It settled with Mortgage Investors Corp. for $7.5 million. \nThe state and national no-call lists are meant to reduce sales calls. In many cases, telemarketers representing charities, political organizations, telephone surveys and customers’ telephone companies or companies that have an existing business relationship with consumers are allowed to call, regardless whether a number is registered on a no-call list.
