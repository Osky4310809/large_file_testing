A queen-to-be forever.” \nDanai Gurira and Lupita Nyong’o have become fast-friends while working together on Black Panther for the past several months in Atlanta, and even though Gurira's 39th birthday was last month (February 14) and Nyong’o's 34th birthday occurred last Wednesday (March 1), The Walking Dead star and the Academy Award-winning actress threw a joint birthday party the other day. \nTo make the occasion extra special, it was a Coming to America -themed party. Why? Because the two actresses share an affinity for the 1988 romantic comedy — which features Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall expertly playing four roles apiece and is about an African prince who comes to America in search of a bride. \nThose that attended the party dressed up as characters from the film. Nyong’o dressed up as the Lady-in-Waiting (played by Sheila Johnson), Gurira arrived as the eager to please Imani Izzi (played by Vanessa Bell), and Black Panther himself, Chadwick Boseman , came as the emotional Reverend Brown (played by Hall). \nDaniel Kaluuya ( Get Out ), Winston Duke ( Person of Interest ), and Janelle Monáe ( Hidden Figures ) were some of the other celebrities on hand to wish them a happy birthday. \nA post shared by Lupita Nyong'o (@lupitanyongo) on Mar 5, 2017 at 12:03pm PST \nA post shared by Lupita Nyong'o (@lupitanyongo) on Mar 5, 2017 at 2:11pm PST \nA post shared by Lupita Nyong'o (@lupitanyongo) on Mar 5, 2017 at 3:12pm PST \nA post shared by Lupita Nyong'o (@lupitanyongo) on Mar 5, 2017 at 1:21pm PST \nA post shared by Danai Gurira (@danaigurira) on Mar 1, 2017 at 7:00pm PST \nBlack Panther follows T’Challa who, after the events of Captain America: Civil War , returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T’Challa’s mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk. \nThe film stars Chadwick Boseman , Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira , Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. Additional cast members include Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Florence Kasumba, Sterling K. Brown, and John Kani. \nRyan Coogler directs from a screenplay he co-wrote with Joe Robert Cole.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:45:32.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
