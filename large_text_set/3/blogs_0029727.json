The visual rendering crew at Car Keys have placed the racers’ liveries upon a road-going or concept equivalent, and as befitting the Albert Park race results , we shall kick off with a Prancing Horse. \nFerrari LaFerrari / Ferrari SF70-H \nMaranello’s most recent, limited-run hypercar has hints of FXX K to it with the SF70-H livery applied; the flashes of white over the rosso hue may be cause for the resemblance. Ferrari has for a long time been keen to make the racing connection with its road cars, and like recent F1 cars, the LaFerrari has electric boost to go with its petrol-fuelled horsepower. \nMercedes-AMG GT R / Mercedes-AMG F1 W08 EQ Power+ 2017 Silver Arrows Launch – First Shots \nThe Mercedes-AMG GT R’s 577 hp output is some distance from the works F1 W08 EQ Power+ racer’s, but the road car still manages 0-96 km/h in 3.5 seconds, while handling is augmented by all-wheel steering. \nAston Martin Valkyrie / Red Bull RB13 \nAston Martin’s joint hypercar project with Red Bull Advanced Technologies draws plenty from the world of motorsport, however instead of the F1 racer’s turbo-hybrid power unit, the Valkyrie is powered by a naturally-aspirated V12 putting out 1,000 hp. Weight is tipped to be 1,000 kg, making for a 1:1 power-to-weight ratio. \nMercedes-AMG GT Concept / Williams FW40 \nIt is perhaps unusual to see a large, luxurious Mercedes decked out in racing colours, though it’s exactly what we have here – the Mercedes-AMG GT Concept here is actually the first three-pointed star model to gain EQ Power+ branding, which signifies the use of electrification for enhancing performance. \nMercedes-AMG SLS / Force India VJM10 The Sahara Force India F1 VJM10. Sahara Force India F1 VJM10 Livery Reveal, Tuesday 14th March 2017. \nAlready an imposing car, the Mercedes-AMG SLS gains the Force India VJM10’s pink livery. Does it add to the gullwinged supercar’s assertiveness, or does it detract from it? You decide. \nAlpine A110 / Scuderia Toro Rosso STR12 Scuderia Toro Rosso STR12 Car from Carlos Sainz is seen during a studio photo shooting in Faenza, Italy on February, 2017 // Guido De Bortoli / Red Bull Content Pool // P-20170226-00506 // Usage for editorial use only // Please go to www.redbullcontentpool.com for further information. // \nPerhaps a more modest road car here, the Alpine A110 nonetheless uses a rear mid-engined layout driving the rear wheels, with 252 PS propelling the French two-seater from 0-100 km/h in 4.5 seconds, and a top speed of 250 km/h. \nRenault Trezor / Renault R.S.17 \nMeasuring 4,700 mm long, a staggering 2,180 mm wide and just 1,080 mm tall, the Renault Trezor two-seater EV will have massive presence should it be driven on a road, and the racing livery will doubtlessly add further to it. With 350 hp and 380 Nm driving the rear wheels, the Trezor manages 0-100 km/h in less than four seconds. \nFerrari 812 Superfast / Sauber C36-Ferrari \nThis is one of those series-production cars with naturally-aspirated outputs knocking on the doors of F1 cars not too long ago, unassisted by electric drive. With 800 PS and 718 Nm of torque from its free-breathing V12, the Ferrari 812 Superfast does 100 km/h from a standstill in 2.9 seconds, and a top speed of 340 km/h. \nHonda NSX / McLaren-Honda MCL32 \nThe Honda NSX joins the petrol-electric, high-performance hybrid movement with its 3.5 litre, turbocharged V6 engine producing 500 hp and 550 Nm of torque, mated to three electric motors for a total system output of 573 hp and 645 Nm of torque. It could be argued that the NSX has had better success in racing than its F1 counterpart, having taken a class win at last year’s Pikes Peak International Hill Climb . \nFerrari 458 Speciale / Haas VF-17 \nRounding up the roster is the Ferrari 458 Speciale with Haas VF-17 livery. The Speciale is the last mid-engined, naturally-aspirated coupe from the marque, and has a special place in many an enthusiast’s dream garage, with peak power arriving at 9,000 rpm.
