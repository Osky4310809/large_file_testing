Awards shows are a showcase of the latest trends, and it’s not totally cray that sometimes outfit choices feature some overlap. Less common, though, is total out-and-out matchy-matchy dressing. And — oops! — that’s exactly what happened to Carrie Underwood and Faith Hill. \nOkay, so they’re not EXACTLY the same dress. Faith’s Zuhair Murad gown was a bit of a sleeker take on the look than Carrie’s bell-sleeved, beaded number. Still, the commonalities were uncanny. Sternum peephole? Check. High collar? Uh-huh. Long sleeves? You betcha! Combine those shared features with the fact that BOTH stars’ dresses featured a long skirt with a high center-slit and a common color scheme and you’ve got… well, one awkward red carpet moment. Good thing they both looked stunning. \nIt happens to the best of us, ladies. \nHave you ever accidentally twinned at an event?
