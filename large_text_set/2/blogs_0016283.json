We want to thank everyone who has joined Tiny’s Facebook page and donated to his cause.” \nIn 2014, while the shelter was celebrating its 100th anniversary, the inspirational kitty was presented on the floor of the Provincial Legislature, the first animal in the history of the Province to have that honor, the shelter said. \nThe cat, who went into a foster home after he was discovered in a box with another cat in 2011, weighing a whopping 30.2 lbs., gradually lost the weight with exercise and a low-calorie vet prescribed diet. In 2013, Tiny reached his “goal weight” of 16 lbs., according to his Facebook page. \nKaren McGeean, marketing and development director for the FSPCA, said Tiny’s death was sudden. \n“Tiny’s passing is a shock to all who knew and loved him,” she said in a statement. “While he has done very well since losing and successfully keeping off the weight with the help of his amazing foster/adoptive mom, we recognize that he was elderly and we were all able to give him a healthy, happy life to the end. Again this emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy weight for all pets and we encourage everyone to work with their veterinarian regarding proper nutrition or a weight-loss plan.” \nTo help other animals in Tiny’s honor, call 506-459-1555 or donate via Facebook.
