O’Connor (a.k.a. CosmicSkeptic ) does a nice job responding to an old video of a man who says atheism is a disease . \nThese video rebuttals are genuinely helpful, even if they come years after the original video came out. They expose new people to old arguments (that never really went away) in a modern voice. Many of the arguments for and against God are roughly the same as they’ve ever been — but we always have new ways to debate, discuss, and share them. More power to Alex and anyone else who attempts to refute these religious claims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:32:22.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
