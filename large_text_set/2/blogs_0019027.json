The past nine months have taken Johnson to new heights, yet it seems like he has just begun his ascent. \nHa Na Jang (+5%): With a comeback victory in Australia, maybe it’s Jang, not Lydia Ko , who is the biggest threat to Ariya Jutanugarn’s Player of the Year defense. That’s her fourth W since the start of last season. \nThomas Pieters (+4%): A tie for second at Riviera moved the Belgian bomber closer to securing special temporary status on the PGA Tour . Seeing more of this stud in the States is a good thing for golf fans. \nRory (+2%): Politics aside, McIlroy’s round with President Donald Trump confirms that he’s still on schedule to return next week after a nearly two-month absence because of a stress fracture in his ribs. Just in case you thought the Masters landscape couldn’t get any more crowded. \nMuirfield (+1%): Given a second chance after its all-male membership voted against inviting women, the R&A hinted strongly that the storied links would return to the Open rota if the proposal passes next month. \nFALLING \nLizette Salas (-1%): Trying to match the Americans’ LPGA win total for all of last year, the 54-hole leader instead slumped to a 78 – the third-worst score of the day – to drop into a seven-way tie for seventh. \nBryson (-2%): Fans let DeChambeau have it when he withdrew from Riviera, citing a right-hand injury from “work(ing) too hard.” Whatever the reason, his rough year continues – he has made just 3-of-9 cuts, with his best finish a tie for 36 th . \nJ-Day’s putting (-3%): Dethroned as the world No. 1, Day still can’t find his stroke – the game’s best putter a season ago, he now ranks 186 th on Tour. But if there’s a reason for optimism: March was when he found his groove last year. \nBubba (-5%): Eight over par with two holes to play, Watson was a no-show when second-round play resumed Saturday morning, and no reason was given for his withdrawal. Not a good look for the defending champion. \nFore! (-8%): A small sampling of a larger issue: Pat Perez pegged fans in the forehead and arm with errant tee shots, and neither Perez nor anyone in the group warned the gallery. When did spectator safety become a secondary issue?
