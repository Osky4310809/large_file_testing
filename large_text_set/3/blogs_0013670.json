We launched SkiaSharp in February of last year to address these issues. \nSkiaSharp offers developers a cross-platform, high-performance 2D API for .NET, available across mobile, desktops, and servers. It’s powered by Google’s Skia library , the same library that powers Google Chrome, Firefox, and Android’s graphic stacks. \nSkiaSharp is great for developing cross-platform, pixel-perfect, resolution independent graphic assets, but requires that the developer design the graphic as code, which why we’re launching Kimono Designer for macOS today. \nKimono Designer allows a developer or graphic artist to graphically edit SkiaSharp based graphic objects, that can be converted to code and included in any cross-platform language and OS that SkiaSharp supports. \nKimono Designer provides several key features that make it the perfect tool for designing SkiaSharp graphics, including: Groups with Boolean Operations and Masks Named Color Palettes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:09:39.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
