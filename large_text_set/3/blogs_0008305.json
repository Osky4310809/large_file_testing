They’re also creating paying jobs for a number of people (mostly fellow high school or college students) who could use the extra work. \nAs public schools ready for likely changes to their federal funding thanks to new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Toot could be a supplement parents may want to entertain. \nBy texting 424-292-TOOT and paying 50 cents a minute for a single tutoring session or $49 per month for unlimited tutoring sessions, students get to text immediately with a vetted tutor who will help with math, science, statistics, and physics homework problems. An example of a sample tutoring session in Toot \nFleeing discrimination and creating opportunities \nThat product was born out of both the discrimination Zabihian faced in Iran, and Parsa’s own experience in college. \n“Originally… I just started it because I wanted to solve a problem I had in college. The night before my finance final my tutor’s wife went into labor… and I needed help right away,” but Paras redoubled her efforts after meeting her co-founder. “When I met someone so gifted who didn’t have the right to go college. That’s when I thought I would go all in on it.” \nPersecuted in his homeland, Zabihian was denied access to higher education due to his family’s faith. \nA self-taught coder whose first business was helping his father design Web sites, and eventually he started his own company, Sohasoft, a Mint-like tool for financial management. \nWith the money from his website development business, the self-taught Zabihian went to Tehran, Iran’s capital. There he enrolled in an underground educational institution to continue his studies. \n“We had in-person classes for one week out of every month and would meet in different houses,” Zabihian said. “The places were announced in the morning and in an hour you had to be there.” \nFor students and teachers who are caught by the authorities, the punishment for educating Bahá’í is a prison sentence. \nAfter seven fraught, fear-filled semester, Zabihian fled to the United States. The road to Los Angeles was a 16-month odyssey. From Iran, Zabihian went to Turkey where he was smuggled across the border under rifle fire. \nOnce in Turkey Zabihian and his fellow asylum seekers received papers from the United Nations allowing them to live in the state. Then came the process for applying for permission to come to America. \n“We had two interviews with the UN and we had an interview with a U.S. official,” Zabihian said. ” We had an FBI security check and a medical check and then we got a paid ticket to LAX.” Chance Encounters and an educational opportunity \nIt was in Los Angeles that Zabihian would meet Parsa, through the close-knit Iranian immigrant community that thrives in the city. \nParsa’s grandfather had immigrated to the United States before the revolution, and her father subsequently built a reputation for an aptitude with technology, first as an employee and then as an entrepreneur launching several businesses in Los Angeles. \nZabihian was renting a $600 per-month apartment from someone who had known Parsa’s grandfather and introduced him to the family, thanks to Zabihian’s computer aptitude. \nThat introduction was the spark that would create Toot. \n“We started working on this app that connected tutors and students on-demand in LA,” said Zabihian. \nThat product was born out of both the discrimination Zabihian in Iran, and Parsa’s own experience in college. \n“Originally… I just started it because I wanted to solve a problem I had in college. The night before my finance final my tutor’s wife went into labor… and I needed help right away,” but Paras redoubled her efforts after meeting her co-founder. “When I met someone so gifted who didn’t have the right to go college. That’s when I thought I would go all in on it.” \nThe first iteration of Toot, the on-demand web-based service, scaled to 2,000 tutors over the course of its first year of operation, but both Parsa and Zabihian were concerned about scaling the business further to reach everyone who Parsa felt needed the service. \n“It was really hard to expand to other places because you need people in those cities to service that city,” Zabihian said. “If we wanted to expand to the other cities with the old platform we’d need to meet and hire managers… if we enabled users to do it remotely we could use our current tutor base.” \nWith that realization and a new business model in tow, the two young founders went out to the Los Angeles investment community, raising $500,000 from a slew of angel investors including Spider Man’s Tobey Maguire, the founders of local startup FabFitFun, and Overnight, Chuck Pacheco, and the Getty Family to name a few. Changing education \n\n“Looking at the industry and where it stands right now… we have this dream to help fix education and I don’t know that in-person tutoring gives any information for how we can help do that,” says Parsa. \nUltimately, Parsa hopes that Toot will not only help students but through the collection of data, also help educators and publishers craft better tools to teach new generations of students. \nBeyond the loftier — and longer term goals — Parsa and her partner are looking to tackle a more immediate problem. Access to quality tutors at an affordable cost. \n“We wanted to solve a problem that students every day not just once a week for an hour,” says Parsa. \nEvery day students are confronted with problems they don’t understand and their typical response is to text a friend. “We want to be that friend,” says Parsa. “Now they have this tool, where they can text a friend (AKA us) who will walk them through a problem.” \nThe first test of the company’s new service came off of a single Instagram ad that brought in 1,000 questions. \nTypically, students will spend 28 minutes in a session with a tutor. Once a student texts the number 424-292-TOOT they are immediately logged into a session. A chatbot determines the course of study that the student wants help with and connects immediately to a tutor. Tutors initiate the session with a command to the chatbot and stop the session in the same fashion. \nTutoring sessions are monitored by the company for inappropriate chats and each tutor receives a rating from the students they work with. \nCandidates for tutoring are also thoroughly vetted by the company — including background checks, interviews, and testing. this is a new way of learning… and… I think that initially when people hear about it, they don’t understand how their student is going to learn via text… it is the preferred method of communication for students.. \n“This is a new way of learning… and… I think that initially when people hear about it, they don’t understand how their student is going to learn via text, but text is the preferred method of communication for students. They want this,” Parsa says. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T20:00:13.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
