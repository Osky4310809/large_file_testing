Advertisement \nHan Solo: A Smuggler’s Trade— directed by Keith Allen and written by Allen, Jared Bell, and Nathan Nauert—follows Han a few years before the events of the original trilogy, as he attempts to swindle cards, blast his way out of his troubles, and make a living as a swarthy smuggler. \nIt’s short, but it hits all the quintessential Han Solo-y vibes—deals gone awry, cantina room brawls, and yes, beloved wookiee partners-in-space-crime. Jamie Costa as the titular young smuggler isn’t half bad at emulating the swagger and drawl of a young Harrison Ford, either.
