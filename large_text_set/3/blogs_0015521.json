Since November 8 last year, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation in the government’s efforts to fight against corruption and black money , the agency had registered a number of cases. The ED and other agencies had also raided several places since then. \nIn December last year, the agency recovered approximately Rs 13.65 crore from lawyer Rohit Tandon’s firm was summoned by the agency in the money laundering case today. Currency notes found at his home on December 10 included Rs 2.60 crore in new currency notes. During the search operation, sleuths had also collected cash counting machine from the spot. Tandon had declared Rs 125 crore in unaccounted income to the Income Tax department during a raid at his office on October 19 last year. \nThe agency had also arrested a Kolkata-based businessman Paras Mal Lodha from the national capital last year, accusing him of converting more than Rs 25 crore in old cash linked to Tandon into new currency and businessman J. Shekhar Reddy. \nEarlier today, Yasin Malik, chairman of the Jammu Kashmir liberation Front and SAS Geelani, chairman of the Hurriyat were summoned by the Enforcement Directorate on April 3 for their involvement in various money laundering and FEMA cases. According to CNN News18, the Income Tax department had found $10,000 in June 2002, when they had searched Geelani’s house in Hyderpora. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nGeelani, who is a separatist leader and advocates the movement openly, was found to be lacking a satisfactory explanation involving the source of the money. He had then been summoned by the Income Tax department but had failed to appear and the case has since been pending with the I-T and the Enforcement Directorate since then. Yasin Malik’s case goes even farther back to 2001 when the police had found and seized $1 lakh after searching one Ahmad Dar and his wife, Shazia Rasool. On being interrogated, Dar had revealed that the money belonged to Altaf Qadri of Nepal, who had given it to him and asked to hand it over to Yasin Malik. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:08:52.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
