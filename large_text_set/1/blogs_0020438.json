Patriots Drive For Five \nThe bus will depart Gillette Stadium on Wednesday, Jan. 25, and after making a number of carefully planned stops along the way, it will arrive in Houston on Sunday, Jan. 29. \nBoth Hardy and Big Jim will be providing commentary throughout the journey, both on Patriots.com, through the Patriots’ social media accounts, and of course, by calling in to 98.5 The Sports Hub throughout the week. Hardy and Big Jim will be checking in twice every show for the duration of the trip, beginning with Zolak & Bertrand on Wednesday.
