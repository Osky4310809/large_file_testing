Those bottom-tier numbers also reflect the support he’s gotten from melanin-rich celebrities as well (outside of Kanye West ). Steve Harvey also caught flak on Friday (January 13) for visiting the president-elect at Trump Towers and announcing his plans to work with Department of Housing and Urban Development lead Ben Carson. \nOne outspoken comedian that’s had enough is D.L. Hughley, who went to social media to speak on his disgust with Donald Trump and his use of black celebrities who are willing to support him. \n“It amazes me that to convince black people that Donald Trump cares about them, he takes pictures with celebrities,” he said. “If Donald Trump cared about black people, he would not have denigrated the president with those claims of ‘birtherism.’ He would not have stoked fears and racist fears or saying that this man is less than, or not one of us to become president.” \nHughley went on to question Trump’s intentions about the photo ops. \n“You know why you have a comedian, rapper and football player out to talk about the concerns of the community,” asked Hughley. “Because that’s the positions you’re used to seeing us in. You’d rather have black people as football players, comedians and rappers than the president. You’d rather see us run the ball than run the country. ” \nOther black notables putting their weight behind the president-elect normally all sit in the “has-been” D-list range including Omarosa, Dennis Rodman, Ray Lewis, Stacey Dash and everyone’s favorite part-time rapper/full-time social media bottom-feeder Azealia Banks . More recently, Broadway legend Jennifer Holliday accepted the invitation to perform during Trump’s upcoming inauguration before dropping out and apologizing today (January 14) after criticism. \nSteve Harvey went on to defend his stance on Twitter saying he was invited by both Trump and Obama’s transitional teams for the meeting. \n— Steve Harvey (@IAmSteveHarvey) January 13, 2017 Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
