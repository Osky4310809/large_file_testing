Sorry tax payers!\nThis is certainly unprecedented additional costs!\nMind you, this is the same guy who said this on the campaign trail:\n\"There's no time for vacation. We're not going to be big on vacations.The White House is this incredible place. It represents so much, and you're there for a limited period of time. If you're at the White House and you have so much work to do, why do you fly? Why do you leave so much?\"\nWe're wondering that same thing!\nWhile the report didn't provide information for former presidents' spending, The Post said:\n\"The $26.8 million budget item is marked as $0 in previous years, which former Secret Service agents said likely meant that the costs were part of a new budget category designed to encapsulate the unusual expense of protecting the first lady and the president's youngest son because they live outside the White House.\"\nAn insider told the outlet the requests for additional funding have been rejected by the White House's Office of Management and Budget, but that just means the S.S. will have to find other ways to cover the costs.\nLongtime Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow told The Post :\n\"The Secret Service cannot dictate the lifestyle of the protectee. They have to work around it. I don't think they expected him to go to Florida so often. This was an unanticipated reality.\"\nSeeing a lot of that lately.\nThoughts??
