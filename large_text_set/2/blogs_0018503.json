Hit the jump to see the first Han Solo movie photo featuring the cast about the Millenium Falcon about to take off on the filming of this epic adventure film.\n\nThe photo features: Woody Harrelson who is playing Han’s criminal mentor , directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller , Alden Ehrenreich who is playing Han Solo, Emilia Clarke who is playing an unknown female role (originally thought to be a love interest), Donald Glover takes on the iconic role of Lando Calrissian , Phoebe Waller-Bridge who last week jokingly denied being in the film will reportedly be playing the first significant female droid in Star Wars history, and Joonas Suotamo , who was credited as Peter Mayhew’s double for Star Wars: The Force Awakens , is under that costume suit as Chewbacca. Thandie Newton, who also stars in the film is not pictured here. Lord and Miller released the following statement:\n“Watching such inspired people from all over the world, with such unique voices, come together for the sole purpose of making art, is nothing short of miraculous. We can’t think of anything funny to say, because we just feel really moved, and really lucky.”\nAlongside the production start announcement, Disney has confirmed many of the crew that will help bring this movie to life:\nCrewing the ship will be some of the industry’s top talent, including Academy Award nominee for his work on Arrival, Bradford Young (Director of Photography), Chris Dickens (Editor), Dominic Tuohy (SFX Supervisor), Rob Bredow (VFX Supervisor) and Brad Allan (Action Designer). They will be joining returning Star Wars veteran crew members Neal Scanlan (Creature & Droid FX Creative Supervisor), Neil Lamont (Production Designer), Dave Crossman and Glyn Dillon (Co-Costume Designers), Jamie Wilkinson (Prop Master), Lisa Tomblin (Hair), Amanda Knight (Make-Up) and Nina Gold (UK Casting Director).\nThe screenplay was written by Lawrence and Jon Kasdan, and the movie will be produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Allison Shearmur, Simon Emanuel, and co-produced by Kiri Hart, Susan Towner, and Will Allegra. Lawrence Kasdan and Jason McGatlin will executive produce.\nThe untitled Han Solo Star Wars Story is slated for release on May 25th, 2018, debunking the rumors that the film was moving to December .\nThe post ‘Han Solo’ Movie Photo: The Cast Takes Flight on the Millennium Falcon appeared first on /Film .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:45:51.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
