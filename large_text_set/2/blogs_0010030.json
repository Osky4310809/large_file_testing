The entertainment company Super Deluxe masterfully strung together a series of President Trump’s most memorable thoughts that he reduced to 140 characters… and then they set them to music. \nThe result: a two-minute, 41-second anxiety-filled song. \nIt starts with an into, setting up the song’s mood — that of a man who was sworn in as president, but “the victory hasn’t stopped him from whining on Twitter about the public’s response to the election.” \nListen to it below. We noticed that @realdonaldtrump ‘s tweets are basically the lyrics to an early 2000s emo song, so we turned them into one. pic.twitter.com/WjquEHrreo \n– Super Deluxe (@superdeluxe) February 12, 2017 Anti-Trump Playlist: 11 Songs Against New President (Videos) Donald Trump is entering the Oval Office with the lowest recorded approval rating of any incoming president. Millions are expected to march nationwide against him the day after he was inaugurated. There's a lot of rage going around, and it's being reflected in our music. Here's a playlist of anti-Trump anthems that have been created since Trump began his road to the White House. Green Day turned Trump into a monster in the lyric video for their latest single, \"Troubled Times.\" The last Republican president (George W. Bush) inspired Green Day to make \"American Idiot.\" Who knows what they will make during the Trump era? Anohni collaborated with the experimental sister duo CocoRosie to create \"Smoke 'Em Out,\" a song they hope will serve as a call to the \"weary-disappointed hearts of so many crest-fallen citizens.\" Don't think that Anohni is an Obama fan anymore, though. She also wrote a song about her disillusionment with the President of Hope. In the days leading up to the inauguration, Fiona Apple promoted the National Women's March with \"Tiny Hands,\" a song that features a chant that Apple wants to be yelled out at The March: \"We don't want your tiny hands anywhere near our underpants!\" Though they never mention Trump, A Tribe Called Quest's latest single \"We The People ...\" clearly calls out the xenophobic rhetoric that became so prevalent in 2016. Sample lyrics: \"Muslims and gays/boy we hate your ways.\" In a similar vein, English rock band Depeche Mode has released a new single called \"Where's The Revolution,\" which definitely taps into the frustration that has moved millions to protest since Trump took office. Meanwhile, hackers have taken over radio stations in five states that went to Trump in the election and have forced them to play YG and Nipsey Hu$$le's rap song \"F*** Donald Trump\" on repeat. The day before the inauguration, Moby released a new music video for his song \"Erupt and Matter.\" The video includes Trump among images of riots, terrorism and Bashar al-Assad. OK Go took Morrissey's song \"Interesting Drug\" and turning it into an anti-Trump song with a video that shows the lowlights of Trump's campaign over the past year. Sample lyric: \"There are some bad people on the rise/They're saving their own skins by/Ruining other people's lives\" Trump was such a big deal that Gorillaz ended a six-year hiatus to release a song against him. \"Hallelujah Money\" features a Trump Tower-like lobby and lyrics that attack greed. Death Cab For Cutie's \"Million Dollar Loan\" attacks Trump's boasts about his business track record. The title refers to the loan Trump got from his father to help start his business empire. But by far the most rage-filled anti-Trump anthem you'll find is Brujeria's \"Vive Presidente Trump!\" The Spanish lyrics, told from the perspective of bloodletting Mexican drug bandits, hope for a Trump presidency \"because he wants war, just like us. If he starts it, we'll finish it.\" The track ends with the sounds of the grindcore band hacking Trump to pieces with machetes. Yikes.
