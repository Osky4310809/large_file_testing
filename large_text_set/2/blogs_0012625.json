'Don't leave it too late' \nThe Port Hills fire broke out in two separate places on Monday in the dry hills south of Christchurch, before merging into one blaze which now covers abut 1,800ha. \nMore than 130 firefighters have been deployed, along with 14 helicopters and three aircraft brought in from across the South Island. \nA total of 400 homes were evacuated by police, but hundreds of other people have also chosen to leave the area. \nPolice Snr Sgt Ash Tabb warned people that fires can change direction and move quickly, giving little time to escape. \n\"If you're worried, don't leave it too late - it's better to be safe than sorry.\" \nOne man told New Zealand's Stuff website that he watched his home burn down from a distance. \n\"I can't believe it's just caught on fire after it survived the night,\" said Henry Reese. \nPrime Minister Bill English arrived in Christchurch on Thursday morning and viewed the fire from the air. \nHe said it was \"contained but not controlled\", but that the local community \"knows how to stick together when things are difficult\". \nWith smoke spreading across the city, the council has issued a warning to residents to see a doctor if they experience breathing difficulties.
