But finding a group that accepts you for who you are can be one of life’s greatest challenges. That’s why the internet is loving this poem written by a 10-year-old boy with Aspergers. \nWhen he was assigned to write an “I Am” poem for school, Benjamin wrote a heartfelt piece about how he feels “odd.” 2 \nHere’s the full poem: \n“I am odd, I am new \nI wonder if you are too \nI hear voices in the air \nI see you don’t, and that’s not fair \nI want to not feel blue \nI am odd, I am new \nI pretend that you are too \nI feel like a boy in outerspace \nI touch the stars and feel out of place \nI worry what others might think \nI cry when people laugh, it makes me shrink \nI am odd, I am new \nI understand now that so are you \nI say, “I feel like a castaway” \nI dream of a day that that’s okay \nI try to fit in \nI hope that someday I do \nI am odd, I am new” \nThe internet was touched by Benjamin’s beautiful words, sharing the post over 36,000 times. People were quick to remind him that everyone in this world is odd — that’s what makes life interesting. 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T01:33:03.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
