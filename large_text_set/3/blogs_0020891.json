Today, she came back and handed me this. from pics \nThe letter reads:\nGreetings Starbuck barista!\nYesterday at your drive thru we had a less than cheerful encounter. At no fault of yours, you were out of carriers and said you could not take my empty cup (trash). I was less than understanding and my manner was curt.\nI need to apologize. The thought of leaving a trail of unkindness like that is not the path I want to reflect. Not for you, not for me.\nYou are a young man, clearly working hard to build a future and you should be commended. Keep up your attitude of cheer and hope. Stay hopeful no matter what kind of people cross your path (or drive thru :) )\nSurly, God has good blessing in store.\nYou taught this ole lady something yesterday about kindness, compassion and staying humble. \nI thank you! Debbie\nGod bless you today and all your todays.\nIncluded with the note was a very generous $50 bill for the barista. \nThe woman's compassion for the young man is inspiring. Maybe her actions will influence others to take the time to be a little kinder to everyone today. \nWATCH: Adrian Grenier wants you to help our planet by not using straws", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:01:50.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
