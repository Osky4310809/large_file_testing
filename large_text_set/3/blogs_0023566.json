Kids aren’t turned away regardless of skill level or athletic prowess. However, to get on those all-star tournament teams, even 8, 9 and 10 year olds must meet certain standards. These are the same kids who would forget their heads if they weren’t screwed on. The same kids who cry in the supermarket when they can’t have that snickers bar. Being shut down from a chance to compete as an athlete as well as an opportunity to engage in a once in a lifetime experiences can be damning for anyone’s psyche, let alone these little guys. Well not today. Not on this kid’s watch. 2 \nThis little bad ass couldn’t care less what your stereotypes and expectations are. He had a goal and wasn’t willing to give it up. He was cut from his local all-star team four years in a row, at ages 8-11. He kept showing up and they kept sending him home. Finally, in his fifth year of trying, at 12 years old, he made the squad. When he found out the good news, he made a gesture that is even more inspiring – he emailed the league director, the same guy who had cut him four times, and thanked him for the chance. This is a 12-year-old boy showing more determination and humility than many of the “heroes” we put on a pedestal these days. As heartwarming and inspiring as that is, it gets even better. 3 \nWhen the Director of the league received his email, he could have easily said ‘you’re welcome’ and moved on. Hell, who would have blamed him if he really didn’t remember the kid. Instead, this ultimate role model made sure the kid realized that it was his determination and ability that had earned him the spot. He gave all credit to this bad ass little boy who never gave in. This is being a role model. 4 GIF \nWhatever you think about the primadonna’s that populate our professional sports world, THIS is what sports are all about. This is heart. This is determination. Something tells me we’ll be seeing this kid on the diamond under the bright lights a decade from now. Until that time, enjoy your time in the sandlot, kid. You earned it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:53:13.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
