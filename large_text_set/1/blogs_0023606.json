Demonstrator protesting speech by Breitbart editor shot on campus \n\"I can't in good conscience let them publish it while they also publish Milo. So I told me agent over the weekend to pull the project,\" she stated. \"When the announcement about Milo’s book first came out, I was relieved because I thought I didn’t have a book with Simon & Schuster and tweeted something to that effect.\" \n\"Then I remembered my TED Book and that TED is an imprint of Simon & Schuster. I was supposed to turn the book in this month and I kept thinking about how egregious it is to give someone like Milo a platform for his blunt, inelegant hate and provocation. I just couldn’t bring myself to turn the book in. My editor emailed me last week and I kept staring at that email in my inbox and finally over the weekend I asked my agent to pull the book.\" Thousands attend Women's March on Washington Thousands attend Women's March on Washington 1/18 \nProtesters gather outside the White House at the finish of the Women's March on Washington on January 21, 2017 in Washington, DC.

And to be clear, this isn’t about censorship. Milo has every right to say what he wants to say, however distasteful I and many others find it to be. He doesn’t have a right to have a book published by a major publisher but he has, in some bizarre twist of fate, been afforded that privilege.\" \n\"So be it. I’m not interested in doing business with a publisher willing to grant him that privilege. I am also fortunate enough to be in a position to make this decision. I recognize that other writers aren’t and understand that completely. The editor of TED Books is Michelle Quint. I don’t think Michelle is an employee of Simon & Schuster. She works for TED. She is, from my experience thus far, smart, kind, patient, and committed to putting good books into the world.\" \nHow to be Heard is yet to place elsewhere, but Gay hopes the book is published \"someday\".
