Government documents often aren’t made public for decades (if at all), so a lot of this information gets buried.   Winston Churchill, who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the 1940s, was one of many authority figures who chose to cover up UFO and ET phenomena. However, a newly unearthed article written by the politician himself explains why he believed we aren’t alone in this universe. Churchill’s Article “Are We Alone In The Universe?” Keep in mind that at the time he wrote this article, “Are We Alone In The Universe?,” significantly less information regarding UFOs and ETs was available than there is today. Through disclosure, channellings, whistleblowers, and public sitings, we have gained much more information proving the existence of ET life. His first draft was published in London’s News of the World newspaper in 1939 and was then slightly revised in the 50s and republished. The article touches on the Fermi Paradox, which you can read about in our CE article here . The Fermi Paradox essentially tries to answer the question, “Do extraterrestrials exist and if so, why aren’t we freely communicating with them all the time?” There are numerous potential answers to this question; however, it’s important that you understand that we have been visited before. More than a dozen NASA astronauts have publicly stated that UFOs have been spotted, including Dr. Edgar Mitchell and Princeton University Physics Professor Brian O’Leary (read some of their statements here ). The chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, John Podesta, has also been quoted many times discussing the lack of UFO disclosure, as have many other politicians. There is so much information out there to support the idea that ETs have been visiting us, and if you’re unfamiliar with it you can start by reviewing the exopolitics section of our website here .   In regards to Churchill’s essay, he took a fairly scientific stance on the matter, first discussing that “all living things of the type we know require water,” which often guides our search for ET life. He also pointed out that known life can only exist “between a few degrees of frost and the boiling point of water” and goes on to explain how Earth’s temperature is fixed by its distance from the sun. He states, “the sun is merely one star in our galaxy, which contains several thousand millions of others.” “But this speculation depends upon the hypothesis that planets were formed in this way. Perhaps they were not. We know there are millions of double stars, and if they could be formed, why not planetary systems?,” he asks. Churchill continues, “I am not sufficiently conceited to think that my sun is the only one with a family of planets.” A large fraction of extrasolar planets “will be the right size to keep on their surface water and possibly an atmosphere of some sort” and some will be “at the proper distance from their parent sun to maintain a suitable temperature.” In other words, they would be able to house life very similar to that which thrives on planet Earth. He concludes by saying, “with hundreds of thousands of nebulae, each containing thousands of millions of suns, the odds are enormous that there must be immense numbers which possess planets whose circumstances would not render life impossible.” ( source ) There are at least 500-quintillion (or 500 billion billion) sun-like stars out there, and that’s a very conservative estimate. A study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science suggests that at least 1% of the total stars in the universe have Earth-like planets orbiting around them, meaning that 100 billion billion Earth-like planets may exist. For those of you who are skeptical about extraterrestrials, let’s make a conservative estimate that after 1 billion years of existence, only 1% of these Earth-like planets develop life. To help you visualize this, that would be the equivalent to every single grain of sand on Earth representing one planet with life on it. Even if only 1% of that number developed equal intelligence to humans, that would mean there are 10 million billion intelligent civilizations in the universe. If you scale these numbers down using the same estimates to predict how many intelligent civilizations exist in the Milky Way, you’d get 1 billion Earth-like planets and 100,000 intelligent civilizations in our galaxy alone. Given the significant amount of evidence for UFOs and the channellings I’ve seen of extraterrestrials, I am fully confident that not only do these beings exist, but they have in fact visited us as well. To assume otherwise would simply be ignorant. The governments know this, Churchill knew this, and you should too!

Why Churchill Ordered a UFO Cover-Up Files released in 2010 by the U.K. Ministry of Defense suggest that former Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered a UFO cover-up during World War II. Amongst the 5,000 pages of correspondence between the public and British authorities regarding UFO sightings exists a letter that discusses a meeting between Churchill and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The declassified letter is from 1999, and it states that the two leaders were briefed on a UFO incident reported by a Royal Air Force (RAF) bomber crew. While traveling back from Germany, the crew allegedly spotted a metal UFO and even took pictures of it. “This event should be immediately classified since it would create mass panic amongst the general population and destroy one’s faith in the Church,” Churchill allegedly said. The letter reveals that Churchill requested that the information be kept secret for at least 50 years. The archives also show that this wasn’t a rare occurrence at the time; in 1957, reports proved that there was, on average, one UFO sighting per week ( source ). Dr. David Clarke, a UFO consultant to the National Archives, explained why the papers were only being released now, stating , “Since the Freedom of Information Act arrived in 2005, this subject – UFOs – have become the third-most popular subject for people to write to the Ministry of Defence saying ‘please could you release this file, or papers that you hold on this particular case.’“ It should be noted that a lot of UFO documents are likely missing from these files. When the Ministry of Defense was asked to address this, they stated that prior to 1967, all UFO files were destroyed after five years. Thus, any UFO files around the time of World War II would likely have been destroyed. It’s no secret that governments try to hide UFOs from the public, but that could, in a way, be a good thing. Maybe we aren’t ready to contact ETs regularly until we reach a higher state of consciousness, access higher dimensions, and become a more intelligent, peaceful civilization. However, I do believe that through information disclosure, we can awaken a deeper state of consciousness within us and raise our vibration as a collective. I’ll end this article with a fascinating quote by Winston Churchill that reads: “In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.” Churchill’s reasoning behind keeping UFO disclosure at a minimum could have been because he didn’t want to bring more darkness to an already very dark part of history. Sometimes, we aren’t all ready to come into knowledge at the same time, and perhaps Churchill understood this.
