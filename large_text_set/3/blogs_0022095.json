Not when a man is prepared to drive a vehicle along the pavement on a crowded bridge. Not when he's prepared to die in the act of killing. Brutal, crude and effective. \nThere is a cliche of the English, that of the \"stiff upper lip\", of \"Keep Calm and Carry On\". Like many supposed national characteristics, it's an absurd and inaccurate generalisation that contains a kernel of truth. \nThis city prides itself on having survived the Blitz and IRA attacks. \n\"We can't let the terrorists win...our democracy and our tolerance is our strength\" the politicians will say - sentiments with which the vast majority will concur. \nBut it would be disingenuous to deny that this is a shocking moment. I cycle across Westminster Bridge and fight my way through the befuddled crowds of tourists outside Westminster Tube Station several times every week. \nDepending on my mood (and how late I am for my next appointment) I watch with wry amusement or frustration as gaggles of French school children and honeymooning Chinese couples block the pavements as they pose for photographs beneath Big Ben. \nIt's a deeply familiar place, one of the most frenetic junctions in this busy, heaving city. But to the 19th century poet William Wordsworth, it was a place of contemplation. In \"On Westminster Bridge\" he wrote: \nNe'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep! The river glideth at his own sweet will Dear God! the very houses seem asleep; And all that mighty heart is lying still! \nConsolation in poetry in these bleak times? Perhaps not, but I suspect I won't be the only Londoner to stop and pause next time I cross Westminster Bridge, to mourn for those who are dead, and to wish the injured and our own fractured society can heal.
