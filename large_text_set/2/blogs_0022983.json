First, what sealant could withstand blood and sweat, but not urine? What happens if you forget your labia are glued together? Also, as several outlets have already pointed out , does the Mensez team does not realize that while urine comes out of the urethra, menstrual blood comes out of the vagina? That these are two different openings?\nThen, there's the way Mensez has handled criticism ‚Äî by insinuating that periods make women distracted and unproductive. \n\"Yes, I am a man and you as a woman should have come up with a better solution than diapers and plugs, but you didn't,\" Dopps wrote in response to a Facebook critic. \"Reason being woman are focused on and distracted by your period 25% of the time, making them far less productive than they could be.\"\nYikes!\nAnyway, if you were wondering how to pronounce \"Mensez,\" we don't know. But our best guess is \"Men says.\"\nBONUS: Jennifer Aniston blasts the way women are depicted by the media", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:51:58.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
