One of Fauna’s contributions is using her magic for cake baking, which inspired artist Ashley Taylor to envision her heading to Main Street Bakery if she had the chance to visit a Disney park .\n“My favorite part of this illustration is the iconic Sleeping Beauty cake! While Fauna might not be the best baker, her cakes are fun to look at!,” she said “I can see her creating something special for the Main Street Bakery’s window display!”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T16:28:41.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
