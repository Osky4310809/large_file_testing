Elizabeth Warren found herself forcibly silenced by Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday night after he objected to her use of the words of Coretta Scott King to criticize Sen. Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump’s nominee for Attorney General. \nWarren was reading a now-famous letter King wrote in 1986 opposing Sessions’ nomination to a federal judgeship by Ronald Reagan when McConnell suddenly intervened. Referring to the rules of the chamber, he accused her of seeking to “impugn” a fellow senator and demanded that she be silenced. The presiding officer obliged. Warren’s objections were not heeded, and she was forced to stop talking. \nWarren later reacted to the incident on Twitter. I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system. \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 I will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law. \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 Tonight @SenateMajLdr silenced Mrs King's voice on the Sen floor –& millions who are afraid & appalled by what's happening in our country. \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 Story Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:40:33.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
