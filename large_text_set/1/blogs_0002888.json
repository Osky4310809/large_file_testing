Joe Saunders January 6, 2017 at 12:51pm Advertisement - story continues below \nPresident Obama’s not so silver-tongued after all. \nThe man who’s spent eight years pontificating endlessly on everything from American police acting “stupidly” to whether British voters should elect to stay in the European Union, found himself on the receiving end of some tough questions about the astonishing number of murders in his adopted hometown of Chicago last year. \nAnd the president lauded by the left for his eloquent command of the language dropped in about the worst phrase he could have used regarding a possible solution for the deadly violence.

Advertisement - story continues below \nIf a Republican – say, a billionaire Republican who’d just won a historic upset to gain the White House – had used a “bullet” term like that for Chicago’s rampant slaughter, the mainstream media would be having a field day with his “insensitivity” to crime victims. \nIf a Republican offered the litany of excuses Obama did – gang structure, police allocation, gun accessibility, pockets of segregation – he would have been crucified for mouthing meaningless words about one of Americans greatest cities experiencing a crime wave the country hasn’t seen in 20 years. \nCheck out NBC-Chicago’s video of the interview here.

Somali warlords do better than that. \nThe real problem – the problem Obama and his liberal minions in the Democrat Party and the mainstream media won’t admit – is that the only solution to crime is the resolute, pro-active policing that liberals despise. \nSince the Black Lives Matter movement hijacked the national conversation about police work — with astonishing lies that convinced a huge number of Americans that the country’s law enforcement officers are a band of racist thugs straight out of the post-Civil War Democrat Party — policing in the largest cities of the United States has been under a microscope of unfair scrutiny. \nPolice departments are made up of human beings, and officers reacted the way most normal human beings react to danger – by playing it safe. And when police departments play it safe, communities are often not so safe because criminals have a lot more leeway. \nChicago — scene of the recent livestreamed torture of a special needs white man by a quartet of heartless thugs — isn’t the only city that’s seen the carnage. Baltimore, racked by anti-cop riots in 2015 , registered 318 murders in 2016, down from 2015’s mark of 344, but still higher than it had been for 20 years, according to the Baltimore City Paper . \nBut Chicago is the poster child of liberal political dysfunction when it comes to police work, and it’s paying the price — 762 murders in the Bloody City last year. \nPart of that is the cops’ fault. As Heather MacDonald, criminal researcher and author of “The War on Cops,” wrote in the New York Post in July, the unjustified shooting of a black teenager named Laquan McDonald in 2014, and the cover-up that ensued, tainted the police department’s reputation in the eyes of the community. \nBut the political response was worse. As MacDonald also wrote, as part of “reform” efforts, the city adopted policies tailor made by the liberals at the American Civil Liberties Union to discourage police stopping suspicious people on the street, or require onerous paperwork to explain when officers do make a stop. \nThe result has been exactly the kind of carnage any sensible person could have predicted. As MacDonald wrote. \nCriminals have become emboldened by the police disengagement. “Gangbangers now realize that no one will stop them,” says a former high-ranking police official. And people who wouldn’t have carried a gun before are now armed, a South Side officer says. The solution, according to officers, is straightforward: “If tomorrow, we still had to fill out the new forms, but they no longer went to the ACLU, stops would increase,” a detective claims. \nIn other words, the cure to violent crime that President Obama pretends he doesn’t understand — the “silver bullet” he claims doesn’t exist — is police work. Professional, pro-active, effective police work, of the kind liberals detest. \nThat’s the real solution. But it’s one thing the loquacious president will never say. What do you think?
