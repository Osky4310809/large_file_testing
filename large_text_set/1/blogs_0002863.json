Almost 3,000 people were also arrested, and scores were handed long prison terms by military courts. \nOpposition activists say dozens of people have been killed in ongoing clashes between protesters and security forces, while bomb attacks blamed on Iran-backed militants have left a number of police officers dead. \nBahrain King: Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa Name: Means two seas", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T14:45:29.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
