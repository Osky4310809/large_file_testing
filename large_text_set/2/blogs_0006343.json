Ronald Lewis — who was the senior military assistant to former Defense Secretary Ash Carter — will be bumped down to brigadier general because he charged the government for his visits to the strip clubs, made false statements and \"engaged in conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman on multiple occasions.\" Army Lt. Gen. Ronald Lewis, in fatigues at right, with Defense Department Chief of Staff Eric Rosenbach, left, and Defense Secretary Ash Carter at Queen Alia Airport in Amman, Jordan, in July 2015. AP \nLewis had reached the three-star rank of lieutenant general, but he was demoted to major general when Carter fired him more than a year ago after an investigation uncovered that Lewis had misused a government credit card and had become involved in an extramarital relationship. \nFederal law states that military officers can retire only with the benefits of the rank they last served \"satisfactorily\" — a call the secretary of the Army makes for major generals and brigadier generals. \n\"In this case, the Secretary determined that Maj. Gen. Lewis' highest grade of satisfactory service was as a Brigadier General,\" Smith said in a statement. \nCarter, who had been a friend and mentor to Reynolds, said in a statement at the conclusion of the investigation: \"I expect the highest possible standards of conduct from the men and women in this department particularly from those serving in the most senior positions. There is no exception.\" Play", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:02:56.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
