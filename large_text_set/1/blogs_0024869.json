After a stunning recent run, and with the Hornets in poor form, the Gunners are strong favourites. \nAdding to Arsenal’s advantage in quality players is the fact that they will have significant rest time compared to Watford. \nWith both in the FA Cup fourth round, Arsenal playing on Saturday evening, has given them more rest than Watford, who play Millwall on Sunday lunchtime. Did Arsenal offer to move the game? \nThis coming week there are Premier League fixtures on Tuesday and Wednesday. Only three games will be played on Wednesday and it appears Watford have rejected the opportunity to play a night later. \nIt is not clear whether Arsenal made the offer to Watford, or the Premier League but either way Watford boss Walter Mazzarri has explained his thinking with the Hornets hosting Burnley on Saturday, also in the Premier League. \nMazzarri told the Hertfordshire Mercury : “After my long experience, many years playing in the Champions League and the Europa League, I am used to playing three games in one week. I have evaluated this a lot and it is a fact that the most fatigue comes in the third game. By doing this, we have one more day to recover ahead of Burnley.” “The team arrives more tired at the third game” \nThe Watford boss continued: “Burnley first of all, they play one day before us. Our game was changed because of television rights. If Burnley were going to play the same game, then no problem, but we lost one day to Burnley. For the last eight years, from my experience of playing three games in one week, I know for a fact that the team arrives more tired at the third game.” \nIt seems that Watford have simply targeted the Burnley game as a much more likely one to win thanks to their opponents horrible away record this season. \nIn addition, Mazzarri has picked a weakened side at Millwall today to make sure his key players are really only playing two big games this week. Watford starting XI & subs v Millwall Watford boss Walter Mazzarri decided against giving his players an extra day's rest. Arsenal offered to put back Tuesday's game by 24 hours. \n— John Cross (@johncrossmirror) January 29, 2017 Loading tags...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T13:20:01.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
