Here’s what to expect this week:\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration week is getting underway with the kind of headline he’d probably prefer to avoid: More than 40 Democratic lawmakers have decided to boycott Friday’s ceremony.\nA rehearsal for the inauguration is held on Sunday. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) It started with Trump’s criticism of civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) for questioning his election win. Lewis, who will not attend the swearing-in, called Trump’s victory illegitimate because of purported Russian interference in the election. Trump, firing back, tweeted Lewis was “all talk” and should “finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities.”\nThis did not go over well with Democrats, given Lewis’s history as a 1960s organizer for civil rights.\nIt all came to a head Monday — Martin Luther King Jr. Day. A wave of allies in the House, spurred to defend Lewis, soon pledged they would not to attend the inauguration, either. See if your member of Congress is in the group by checking our list .\n‘INSURANCE FOR EVERYBODY’\nHe didn’t provide new specifics, but Trump said he’s nearing completion of a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with a program aimed at providing “insurance for everybody.”\n“It’s very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven’t put it in quite yet but we’re going to be doing it soon,” Trump said in an interview with The Post .\nAs our colleagues wrote, Trump’s declaration that his replacement plan is ready comes after Republicans expressed concerns about the GOP’s lack of a formal proposal as they held votes on repealing Obamacare last week.\n“We’re going to have insurance for everybody,” Trump said. “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.”\nSeats fill the Mall during an inauguration rehearsal on Sunday. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) A LOOK AHEAD AT THE INAUGURATION\nWhat can we expect from the celebrations to mark the first day of Trump’s presidency? Surprisingly, it’s going to be a low-key affair relative to other inaugurations, our colleagues wrote this weekend :\nIn a word, the 45th president’s inaugural activities will be “workmanlike,” said Boris Epshteyn, communications director for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, a pop-up staff of about 350 people scrambling to put together the proceedings from the second floor of a nondescript government building just south of the Mall.\nThe notion of a relatively low-key inaugural bereft of many ­A-list entertainers may come as a surprise, given the president-elect’s flair for showmanship and his credentials as a reality TV star. Epshteyn said that Trump settled on a less flashy approach, however, including keeping the ticket prices for the inaugural balls at $50 apiece so that ­working-class Americans who helped fuel Trump’s victory can take part.\nCROWLEY OUT AMID PLAGIARISM CONTROVERSY\nOne of Trump’s top national security appointees, Fox News personality Monica Crowley, will no longer join the administration amid allegations she plagiarized swaths of her 2012 book and her PhD thesis.\n“I greatly appreciate being asked to be part of President-elect Trump’s team and I will continue to enthusiastically support him and his agenda for American renewal,” Crowley said in the statement, in which she made no mention of the plagiarism charges.\nCrowley had been named senior director of strategic communications at the National Security Council.\nCOMING UP THIS WEEK\nIt’s going to be another big week on Capitol Hill for confirmation hearings. Here’s the rundown , starting Tuesday:\nRep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) , nominated for interior secretary, goes before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources at 2:15 p.m. Betsy DeVos , nominated for education secretary, goes before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions at 5 p.m. On Wednesday:\nWilbur Ross , nominated for commerce secretary, goes before the Senate Commerce Committee at 10 a.m. South Carolina Gov.
