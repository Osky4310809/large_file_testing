Getty By Emily Zemler Jan 31, 2017 \nJanuary has almost come to a close, which means you've either kept the resolutions you made on the first of the month—or your brand new gym membership has totally lapsed. Either way, it's important to take a closer look at what you'd hoped for the year ahead. \nIn honor of that sentiment, we asked 10 women in the entertainment industry which New Year's resolutions Hollywood should be keeping. Each one is something they think the industry should be doing better; each one is something they hope the film and TV world can make happen in 2017. Hollywood: Are you listening? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Resolution #1: Offer Equal Opportunities for Female Directors \n\"My hope for 2017 is that it becomes an equal playing field for both men and women to direct. It shouldn't become harder for our daughters to become directors than for our sons. It should be equal. People who are in positions to hire should make a commitment to hire equally and know that there are a lot of women and diverse directors out there who might not be the first, obvious choice. There are a lot of talented and totally qualified female–and male–directors. You can't just always go for the easy fix. This will help storytelling. It will bring more colors to the stories we're telling.\" \n—Lesli Linka Glatter, Director, Homeland Resolution #2: Make More Films About Interesting, Complicated Women \n\"[Hollywood should] tell more stories like Hidden Figures , a movie about three women who use their super powers—math and engineering—to help America win the 1962 space race. Women make up more than 50 percent of the U.S. population. We go to the movies. We like to see our own stories up on the big screen. Let's make a conscious effort to create and produce movies with interesting, complicated female leading characters. Because if we don't, who will?\" \n—Donna Gigliotti, Producer, Hidden Figures Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Resolution #3: Use the Power of Film to Inspire \n\"[I want Hollywood] to find and foster and bring to the screen projects that will provoke substantive discussion, breed empathy and kindness, help us understand the world and ourselves more clearly, encourage the bravery we need to make our dreams come true, and inspire the belief that the impossible is possible .\" \n—Suzanne Todd, Producer, Bad Moms Getty Resolution #4: Help Each Other... \n\"This year I would ask that the powerful/successful women of Hollywood make an active effort to support, advocate for, and encourage younger women coming up in all facets of media. Not only by hiring them, but by mentoring and giving them constructive criticism to help them grow into the future badasses of our industry .\" \n—Jen Flanz, Executive Producer, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ...Especially People Who Are Different to You \n\"It is our duty to help each other. We're living our dreams because someone else somewhere in our lives carved out an opportunity and made it possible for us. Help someone who doesn't look like you, didn't go to the same school, comes from a different economic background, isn't the most obviously talented, or doesn't have their shit together. The more different we are from each other, the more interesting the stories we'll tell. Our community will be so much better because of it.\" \n—Nadia Hallgren, Cinematographer, Motherland Getty Resolution #5: Get More Women Onstage \n\"I hope men and women start seeking out female comedians to see live. When you see a woman in complete command of a comedy club audience, when you see her destroy a heckler, it becomes pretty obvious that women should be presidentin' the United States. Get used to our voices. We're coming for you. \" \n—Laurie Kilmartin, Comedian/Writer Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Resolution #6: Stand Up Against Harassment and Assault \n\"In 2017, I hope that Hollywood makes a real effort to show women that they are just as important as men in this industry. They can do this by not promoting or working with men with a history of sexual assault or harassment (especially those men whose assaults have been reported and well documented). This is a pragmatic and, frankly, common sense measure to assure women that they are being heard and are valued. The potential benefits are myriad, but one benefit is a less risky bottom line, as audiences won't have a moral dilemma at the box office. If Hollywood wants to show how serious it is about gender equality, take a note from other industries and make it safer for women.\" \n—Shalita Grant, Actress, NCIS: New Orleans Resolution #7: Foster Projects That Represent the Underrepresented \n\" We need to create, write, produce, and support more projects that reflect all of us, not just a few. It's important for all of us to relate and identify with others. When we have the ability to empathize, we can get closer to treating each other better.\" \n—Yesi Ramirez, Casting Director, Moonlight Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Resolution #8: Hire More Female Composers \n\"Hollywood should make strides to embrace, support, and hire more female composers. Although inarguably prominent as performers and songwriters, women are woefully underrepresented in film and television scores. Only 2 percent of composers working on the top 250 films at the box office in the last three years were women. It's time to give these incredibly gifted women their opportunity to create the soundtracks of our lives.\" \n—Alexandra Patsavas, Owner, Chop Shop Music Supervision ( Scandal , Grey's Anatomy ) Resolution #9: Make More Women-Led Documentaries \n\"I resolve to encourage more women to make documentaries using the many formats and platforms now available. We need women to bring their instincts, their empathy, and their life experiences to the subjects they find and cultivate. Whether assembling a team, shooting in the field, making choices in the editing room, or developing outreach campaigns, a woman's understanding of the world she lives in will infuse what she produces. We've seen how audiences are stimulated and enriched by the perspectives of fresh and diverse voices. This is the time to give the voices of women documentarians a chance to be heard.\" \n—Kathleen Dowdey, Producer/Director, John Lewis–Get In the Way", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:19:01.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
