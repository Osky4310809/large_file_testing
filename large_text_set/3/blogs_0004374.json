The allegations , made over Twitter, came with no evidence and have been roundly denied by current and former leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies. \nBrzezinski suggested she had her own sources telling her that Trump knew he had erred. \n“I have some reporting talking to a few people who are either close to the White House or inside it that the president actually knows he messed up and won’t admit it, just refuses to admit it,” said Brzezinski. “Everyone in that inner cadre … they’re so busy trying to either save their hides or get each other’s jobs that they don’t realize Rome is burning.” \n“This president’s style is to let people fight it out,” quipped regular guest, Mark Halperin . \nThe segment was par for the course for Brzezinski, who has already gone nuclear in her response to the White House. Closing Monday’s show, the co-host offered her final thoughts that the Trump administration was “fake and failed. ” Counterpart Joe Scarborough hewed to roughly the same line, Monday. “I think we reached a new low this weekend,” he said of the wiretapping allegations. \nHave a tip we should know?
