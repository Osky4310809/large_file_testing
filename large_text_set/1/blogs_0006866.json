She said, “It was thyroid cancer. I had to get surgery, but during the surgery, it damaged my nerves. Actually, I didn’t talk about this before I made this album. I thought there might be problems if I revealed that I had hurt my throat and so I just endured them by myself. One part of my vocal cords became paralyzed and I couldn’t talk for eight months.” \nShe continued, “I was so confused and taken aback. I couldn’t talk, couldn’t sing, and there was nothing that I could do. That time was so difficult for me. I didn’t get any shots to fix my vocal cords and instead practiced to overcome it,” as the audience applauded her courage. \nShe also opened up about recording her album, revealing, “When I first went in to the studio to record, I was so happy. I was so emotional about my throat and about how time had passed. I didn’t think I could ever step into a recording studio again, so I was very grateful this time around. I didn’t appreciate it when I didn’t have any problems with my voice. I realized how precious everything I have is. I realized it after I had lost it, when I didn’t think I’d find it again. I had heard that I would never be able to sing again. But I thought that if I didn’t overcome this, my life would be sad and I would be missing out. Wouldn’t it be awesome if I was able to overcome it? It’s like a movie. I wanted to win through it. I worked really hard.” \nSuch an inspirational tale!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:13:27.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
