O’Reilly went through the numerous allegations leveled at Trump and his 2016 presidential campaign but downplayed the possibility that anything might come out of those charges. He went on to say that leaks within various federal government agencies must be dealt with.

Republican Congress people wanted to know about the leakers – people within government giving classified information to reporters. That was their top concern. On the Democratic side, it was the Obama tap – the allegation that President Trump Tweeted out.

But today, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said there will be more tap information", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:20:28.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
