Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSouthampton’s defensive crisis threatens to wreck their first cup final in 14 years, and there are growing fears that Virgil van Dijk’s ankle problem could see him miss the remainder of the season. \nHowever, there is hope at St Mary’s that the much-admired defender wants to stay at the club this summer. \nVan Dijk is already out of the club’s EFL Cup final clash with Manchester United later this month. \nThe Dutch international picked up an injury in a clash with Jamie Vardy last month, and has not played since. \nThe Saints defender remains in a protective boot - set to be removed next week - at which point he will face further assessments from the club’s medical staff, having already seen two specialists.

Incoming Martin Caceres is still some way below full fitness, having not played since last February. \nFollowing Fonte’s departure, Van Dijk was named club captain. And the ex-Celtic man is understood to have done so believing that his appointment was not merely for the remainder of the season. \nVan Dijk signed a six-year deal on the south coast last May, and is happy at the club. Since joining from the Scottish champions in 2015 for £10million, he has matured into one of Europe’s finest centre-halves. \nShould Southampton receive an offer in excess of £40million, they are likely to cash in and reinvest, as has become the norm on the south coast in recent years with the sales of the likes of Adam Lallana, Nathaniel Clyne and Luke Shaw.
