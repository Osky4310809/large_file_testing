New Photos Show Mama June With Convicted Child Molester \nAccording to the documents, Melissa’s mother Lisa filed a report to the Edmonds Police Department on April 23, 1990, just one day after her daughter’s second birthday, accusing her ex-husband, now 50, of “rape of a child.” \nREAD THE SHOCKING COURT DOCUMENTS \n“Melissa came home from her father’s house and after she woke up, she was changed by my mother. At that time, Melissa put her finger in her vagina and said plain as day Daddy put his finger in my potty pot,” Lisa wrote. “She has since that time said and done this over and over again. She has even said this out of the clear blue sky to everyone during her playtime.”\nSeveral Eckstrom family members supported Lisa’s allegations in written statements.\nPHOTOS: Pamela Anderson Reveals Rape, Molestation and Gang Rape During Charity Foundation Speech \nIn a July 1990 statement, Melissa’s grandmother Jean claimed the toddler had a rash on her back and began making eerie comments following a recent visit with her father.\n“I heard Melissa say she needed a Band-Aid for her butt,” Jean wrote. “She told me ‘Daddy has a weenie on his tummy. Daddy hurt my butt right here.'”\nDuring a bath that night, the concerned grandmother noticed her bottom was “red,” and her rectum “looked open.”\nAfter arriving at the hospital, the little girl also allegedly said “Daddy pottied on my leg.” Jean claimed Melissa’s mother Lisa began to cry.\nPHOTOS: Heading Back To Arkansas? Moving Trucks Arrive At Josh Duggar’s Maryland Home –– Walls Continue To Cave In On Reality Star’s Life After Molestation Shocker Exposed \nIn a 1991 filing from Sig and Lisa’s nasty divorce, Melissa’s family physician Dr. Mary Gibbons , who treated the toddler after the July 1990 incident, claimed exam findings were “strongly suggestive of sexual abuse.”\n“The genital exam and swelling originally revealed redness in a pattern suggestive of sexual abuse,” the doctor wrote. “There was also tearing of the back part of the vagina.”\n“The anus immediately dilated, remained dilated in a fashion with angulation plus mild extrusion of the inner tissues…All of these findings are rarely seen in children without a history of sexual abuse.”\nAnother document featured a statement from a social worker who treated Melissa in late 1990.\nPHOTOS: Subway Sicko Jared Fogle Desperate For Sandwich Fix! \n“By the second or third visit Melissa had fully disclosed the abuse in detail,” the counselor claimed in her April 1991 statement, given as part of Sig and Lisa’s divorce. “She made it clear to me that she did not like her daddy and that she was fearful of her daddy and that her daddy had hurt her potty-pot.”\n“There is no question in my mind that Melissa Eckstrom/Hansen has been abused.”\nA second therapist, an employee of Child Protective Services, recalled Melissa’s troubling behavior while playing with dolls – including an adult male doll and a female child doll — during a counseling session in late 1990.\n“She then took the clothes off the daddy doll and pointed to his penis. She stated, ‘He hurts her with his weenie,'” the therapist wrote.\nPHOTOS: The Face Of Evil: Jared Fogle’s Lawyer Blames ‘Medical Problem’ For Child Sex Crimes — First Photos Since Confession \n\nAfter the shocking statement, Melissa “curled up in the fetal position with her legs drawn to her chest,” the CPS worker claimed.\nSig has vehemently denied all of the Eckstrom family’s allegations against him.\n“I’m a pretty plain-spoken guy, and to me, this is nothing more than a shakedown,” the reality star told Radar in an official statement. “The allegations are completely false, rehashed lies my ex-wife Lisa Eckstrom used nearly 30 years ago to take away my daughter, and has continued to try to use to extort money from me.”\n“The fact is, decades ago I was exonerated of these allegations after a full court trial. My ex-wife Lisa took me – and worst of all, my parents – to court for this back in 1990, making these baseless claims. We were fully exonerated after a prosecuting attorney, a judge, court-appointed experts, a guardian ad litem and team of other child experts all agreed that these claims were pure fiction. I cooperated 100 percent, including taking a polygraph test that also confirmed my innocence.\nPHOTOS: ‘We Want To Seek Justice!’ Philly DA Vows To Reveal ‘Truth’ About Cosby Sex Assault \n“The tragedy is that my ex-wife Lisa has poisoned my relationship with our daughter through years of vile lies. Lisa has spun a web of deceit, depriving my daughter and me of a healthy, loving relationship. To me, that is the definition of child abuse.”\n“This is the third time the Eckstrom family has threatened to publicly rehash lies about me unless I pay them a pile of money, and I finally said enough is enough. If you’ve got something, bring it, because it was BS then, and it is BS now.”\nWe pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?
