Another celebrity baby has fallen victim to the undying weird name trend.\nThe Backstreet Boys' A.J. McLean and his wife Rochelle welcomed their second daughter on Sunday, March 19. And they named the baby girl Lyric Dean McLean.\nSEE ALSO: Backstreet Boys' Las Vegas residency proves the band is still 'Larger Than Life'\nYep, of course a singer in a '90s boy band named his daughter \"Lyric\" because we all know how meaningful and deep words are in pop songs. Also, her middle and last name kind of rhyme so that's... something.\nLittle Lyric weighed in at eight pounds, three ounces and measured 22-inches long. She joins her 4-year-old sister Ava Jaymes in this \"Larger Than Life\" family.\nMy ride or die homie. Daddy loves you baby.\nA post shared by Aj mclean (@skulleeroz) on Dec 23, 2016 at 10:32am PST\nMcLean gushed about his daughters and said , \"Having two baby girls is a dream come true and we couldnâ€™t be any more proud or excited to welcome Lyric Dean McLean into the world and into our family.\"\nAt least Lyric is in good company. Maybe her, Dusty Rose, Saint, Blue Ivy, and Apple can all get together and have a playdate.\nWATCH: Adorable kid struggling to stay awake while eating is all of us on a Monday", "external_links": ["http://people.com/babies/aj-mclean-welcomes-daughter-lyric-dean/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/fxR8JC1s.m3u8", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BOXq0Y5hhR7/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/fxR8JC1s.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-20T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:10:56.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
