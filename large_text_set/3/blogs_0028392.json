On \"Faith,\" Wayne slithers over a creeping trap beat, delivering quotables and memorable melodies in equal measure. Before he signs off, he hands things off to Young Money 's HoodyBaby, who you may know under his pseudonym Fat Leopard. The project also features guest appearances from Lil Yachty , Future, Pharrell , Rae Sremmurd, Kendrick Lamar, 2 Chainz , and more. However, the strongest record of the bunch may be Chief Keef and Rae Sremmurd's wavy collaboration \"Come Down.\" Faith", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T03:38:58.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
