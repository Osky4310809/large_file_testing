I feel confident and amazing, and feel like my patients are more interested in what I say.” Katie wearing a size 2X swimsuit in May 2015 in Florida (Photo: PA Real Life) Read More \nKatie had been overweight her whole life, despite playing volleyball and swimming as a teen. \nLooking back, she admitted her size was largely down to her poor diet. \nShe’d eat biscuits for breakfast, fast food for lunch and macaroni cheese or fried chicken for dinner – as well as snacking on cookies throughout the day. \n“I was disgusted with the size of my stomach and I felt I had so many chins,” she said. \n“Clothes looked awful on me and I’d cry when I went shopping because nothing would fit.” \nDespite being self-conscious and unhappy with her rolls, Katie would justify her weight by telling herself her body was naturally meant to be bigger. \nBut when she started working as a nurse, she realised how risky being big can be and decided to change.

Read More \nShe continued: “A lot of people think weight loss surgery is miraculous and that the weight just falls off, but you still have to eat healthy and exercise.” \nFrom there, Katie completely overhauled her diet, swapping fast food for fresh fruit and vegetables. \nOn a typical day, she’d have egg and turkey bacon for breakfast, half a grilled chicken breast for lunch, a Caesar salad for dinner and peanut butter protein balls as snacks. \nShe also started running three miles three or four days a week. \nIn just a year, she lost 9st 2lb, and said she “felt on top of the world.” \nBut her rapid transformation left her with folds of excess flesh, which began to chip away at her new found confidence. Read More \nShe told of how she’d wear tight clothes that would “suffocate her abdomen” to cover it up. \nSo, in January 2017 she underwent an abdominoplasty operation to remove her excess skin. \nShe also had a breast lift at Bardmoor Surgery Centre, Florida. \nAfter that, she said she could finally look in the mirror and know what her body looked like. \nKatie, who documents her progress on Instagram @kburg21, said: “Now I catch myself staring at my reflection and I’m so amazed I can barely recognise my body. \n“For the first time I feel like people won’t judge my body, and I won’t either. I even tried on a bikini for the first time last week. \n“I think I’m a better nurse now and will walk into work confident in my new size small scrubs.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:56:24.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
