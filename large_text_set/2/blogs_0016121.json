And I can’t do a thing about it.” \n“When you say ‘a bunch of idiots’ voted Trump in,” she said. “You’re talking about half of all Americans! We were hopeful at first, and now we’re angry and tired of being blamed. Nobody wants to listen anymore, and that’s where my sadness comes from.” \nDemocrats nationwide have staged a steady stream of protests since the election, with several groups storming Washington, D.C., on the weekend of the inauguration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:44:11.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
