The increase was nearly double from the previous five-year period studied. \nSaudi Arabia was the world's second largest arms importer in 2012-16 with an increase of 212 percent compared to 2007â€“11. Weapon imports by neighbouring Qatar, meanwhile, surged 245 percent. \nThe majority of other states in the Middle East also increased arms imports, although at a lower rate than the Gulf nations. \n\"Over the past five years, most states in the Middle East have turned primarily to the USA and Europe in their accelerated pursuit of advanced military capabilities,\" said Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme, in a statement. \n\"Despite low oil prices, countries in the region continued to order more weapons in 2016, perceiving them as crucial tools for dealing with conflicts and regional tensions.\" \nConflicts in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen have led to hundreds of thousands of deaths over the past few years. WATCH: Who's benefiting from the war industry? \nGovernments around the world spent $1.57 trillion on \"defence\" purchases in 2016, according to Jane's Defence Budgets. \nIndia was the world's largest importer of major arms in 2012-16, accounting for 13 percent of the global total - far greater than regional rivals China and Pakistan, SIPRI reported. \n\"With no regional arms control instruments in place, states in Asia continue to expand their arsenals,\" said Wezeman. \n\"While China is increasingly able to substitute arms imports with indigenous products, India remains dependent on weapons technology from many willing suppliers, including Russia, the USA, European states, Israel and South Korea.\" \nIn Africa, Algeria was the largest arms importer accounting for 46 percent of all weapons sales on the continent. Nigeria, Sudan, and Ethiopia were the largest buyers of heavy weapons in sub-Saharan Africa. Inside Story - Who's benefiting from the war industry?
