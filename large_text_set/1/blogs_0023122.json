Former Ekiti State Governor Segun Oni and other dignitaries commiserating with Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor. \nOn Friday, November 18, 2016, no fewer than 29 Hiace and 15 Coaster buses left the Ajamimogha base of the Word of Life Bible Church in Warri to complement the swarm of Niger Deltans who had taken time off their duty posts and businesses to besiege the Ekiti State capital to commiserate with their adorable mentor and source of inspiration, the delectable wife of the founder/presiding pastor of the Word of Life Bible Church, Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor. Mama Helen Oritsejafor, as she is fondly called, is one of the surviving 18 children of the late Pa Gabriel Ojo Falegan. \nSpectacular traditional costumes, displays by Ijaw dancers, Urhobo dancers, Ogonor for Jesus (Itsekiri evangelical group of entertainers) and Ukweke Show in four carefully decorated long trucks depicting fishing boats and canoes with very colourfully attired young men and women bearing paddles representing the different traditional riverine cultures with diverse traditional musical instruments toured major streets of Ado Ekiti with the grey-colored casket of the high chief in tow. \nThe loud procession began from Ile-Abiye Hospital on Ilawe Road and snaked its way to the Ado Ekiti Local Government Secretariat for a commendation service and a brief lying-in-state for the late father-in-law of Oritsejafor, the immediate National President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, who had mobilized the Itsekiri, the Urhobo, the Ijaw and other well wishers from across the country for the five-day event in Ado-Ekiti. \nAs at Wednesday when a lecture was delivered by Prof. Gbenga Aribisala in honour of the fallen politician, facilities in most hotels in Ado Ekiti and several adjoining public facilities including the NYSC Corpers Lodge had already been overstretched and no one was left in doubt that something spectacular was in the offing that weekend. The Atunluse of Ede and Atunwase of Ise-Ekiti was laid to rest on Saturday at his residence in Falegan Estate, Ilawe Road, Ado Ekiti after a funeral service at The Name of Jesus Ministries, Iyin Road, Ado Ekiti. \nAn elaborate reception where guests were entertained took place at the Ekiti State Pavilion, along Secretariat Road, Ado Ekiti. There was plenty to eat and drink for all those who thronged the various venues throughout the duration of the funeral ceremony with a cow roasted on a daily basis as barbecue. \nApart from the loud display of culture from the riverine communities of Nigeria deployed to honour Helen (nee Falegan) the matriarch of the Word of Life Bible Church, the Oritsejafor Family’s In-Law Greeting on Thursday evening was a spectacle to behold. It featured several traditional dances, most of which was evangelical in nature as the entertainers sang, danced to showcase the virtues of the Rock of Ages. \nThe large Warri family was led by a former Minister of State for Defence and Ogwa of Warri Kingdom, Chief Roland Oritsejafor, who used the occasion to extoll the virtues of the fallen chief and his noble family of Ado Ekiti for “the beautiful daughter they have given to us and who has been a wonderful wife, a great mother, a spirit-filled daughter of God and source of mighty blessing to us all in Delta State and beyond”. He added: “We are grateful to God specially that this rare gem, Mama Helen, is our daughter-in-law. \n“We are most sincerely grateful to God who had given her the power and wisdom to build a beautiful house for the Oritsejafors and we are most sincerely for the Falegans who had released her to us. We want to express our gratitude to friends, well wishers from far and near who had taken time to join us in this glorious celebration of life. We are celebrating Papa because indeed, he had achieved a lot in this short period of his life. So, we are very delighted to be partakers of his life and achievements. Through his children, friends and well wishers will continue to remember papa”. His statement naturally elicited applause from the crowd. \nThe Chairman of Ado-Ekiti Progressive Union, Chief David Fasuan, also extolled the virtues of the fallen chief in a brief remark, saying Falegan gave scholarship to several students of his school who were unable to pay their fees, and actually harboured many who today are movers and shakers in the Nigerian nation. \nWhile speaking on behalf of the Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, his Special Senior Adviser on Religious Affairs, Rev. (Mrs.) Omatsola Williams, urged all those present at the ceremony to strive to imbibe the many good testimonies that had been so eloquently spoken of the fallen chief, stressing that the legacy any human being would leave behind should and must be the good reports people give of you. \nThe special adviser described the former CAN President as a spiritual icon who had moved Delta State to Ado Ekiti to join in establishing his love that he has for the Falegan family in view of what he came several years ago to plead for a hand of one of daughters of the family, and has thus become a part of Ekiti people, stressing “your effort in ensuring peace in Delta State and numerous contribution to the development of many both spirtually and physically in the state and beyond has earned you this support from the Delta State government.” \nOne of Nigeria’s versatile music producers/gospel singers and incidentally a son of the soil, Yinka Ayefele, was on hand to entertain the large crowd and 74-year old highlife/juju maestro, Evangelist Ebenezer Obey, former Ekiti State governor, Engineer Segun Oni, Bishop G.O. Onifade, Chief Joseph Otumara, Chief Brown Mene, and others danced heartily to the medley of praise songs. \nEarlier, we had the current PFN national president, Rev. Felix Omobude and his wife, Abiola, former CAN Vice President/presiding bishop of TREM, Bishop Mike Okonkwo, Rev. Don Odunze Jnr, senior pastor of Hilltop International Christian Centre, Port Harcourt, Rev. Chris Oarhe and his wife, Administration Secretary of PFN, Pastor Damilare Akinola among others came to facilitate with the Falegans in solidarity with Papa Ayo Oritsejafor who was full of gratitude to all. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T04:33:23.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
