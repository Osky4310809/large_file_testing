Posted at 11:09   Sam J.   \nSeems the Left is taking this whole Trump inauguration really well … HA HA HA HA HA HA HA. \nOk, so they’re melting down more than butter on the sun, but we’d be lying if we said this hasn’t been a HILARIOUS time to cover them on Twitter. The bleating, whining, crying, complaining and drama makes for great jokes, at their expense of course. \nAnd you KNOW this tweet and photo from Laura Ingraham caused them to implode spectacularly. Memo to the Embittered: Get Over It. pic.twitter.com/iMg7cmx7NQ \n— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) January 19, 2017 \nShort, simple and to the point. Trending YASSSS! Ben Shapiro and conservative Twitter celebrate Obama's LAST DAY, and it's glorious \nSeems Touré was a little fussy with her. The right never got over Obama’s election—they threw a temper tantrum for 8 years—but now they love to tell the left: get over it. Ok. https://t.co/kFfKFXFc8N \n— Touré (@Toure) January 19, 2017 \nW h. Ha! @IngrahamAngle Arrogant liberal progressive ideologue democrat robots need us to survive; we can live perfectly happy lives without them. \n— Bill Wilson (@OPM4everNot) January 19, 2017 \nRight? Whoever will pay for their entitlements? They won’t. @IngrahamAngle I was a Cruz guy. I got over it awhile ago. We gave Obama a chance. I hope people can do the same for Trump. \n— Jeremy (@SirRangeALot) January 19, 2017 \nThey won’t give Trump a chance, he’s not even in office yet and they’re already trying to impeach him. The Left has never been about unity or America, they’ve only been about their agenda and their narrative. The rest is just marketing. @IngrahamAngle Just a reminder to you snowflakes – there will be a conservative Supreme Court appointment next – might as well keep crying!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T18:31:37.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
