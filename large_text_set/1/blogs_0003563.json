Producer Dave Fridmann and band member Steven Drozd helped Burns create his 2003 debut album, Songs for Dustmites, then re-teamed for his sophomore effort, 2009's Deep Sea Recovery Efforts . Now Burns and Drozd have formed a musical duo called STEVENSTEVEN and are gearing up to put out their debut LP. \nThe music clearly has heavy influences from The Flaming Lips, but it also draws from a number of other musicians and characters. Among their extensive list of influences, the duo cites: “Wondering, Burt, Black Sabbath, Cephalopods, Grover, Toy Commercials From The 1970s, Harry Nilsson, Dr. Seuss, Science, Bill Conti, Queen, Futzees, Rocky Balboa, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, True Love, Neil Diamond, The Zoo, Holly Hobbie, Fairy Tales, David Bowie, and Mister Rogers.” \nThe new album, called FOREVERYWHERE , will drop on February 24 and feature themes ranging from unicorn romance to pooping. The music is meant to be enjoyed by all ages; their music video for \"The Unicorn And Princess Rainbow\" is filled with rainbows, space, and an all-kid backing band. \nThe family-friendly musical duo will be trying out some of their songs live February 26 at the Brooklyn Bowl in New York. The all-ages event will kick off in the middle of the day, with doors opening at 11 a.m. and the music starting at 1 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:33:45.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
