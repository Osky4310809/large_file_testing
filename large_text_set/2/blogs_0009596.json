That’s right, it’s Valentine’s Day, the pre-ordained day for you to get ur freak on for the sake of getting ur freak on. And should your partner waiting at home be fed up with your normal boudoir playlist, the A$AP Mob’s Cozy Boys are here to save you. They have just dropped an extra-special Valentine’s mix titled “Cuffin Music.” Stream it below via SoundCloud.\n\nAnd in case you couldn’t tell from the fabulous cover art, tuning in to this mix will make it clear that this is indeed a full hour of primo baby-making music. Some of the artists that A$AP Lou and J.Scott mixed into their sultry set include Jennifer Lopez, Ashanti, Mary J. Blige and Jodeci, amongst even more iconic figures from hip-hop and R&B’s glory days. Unless you actually want to have a child, you best use protection before pressing play in the bedroom.\nBe sure to check our interview and editorial with the Cozy Boys right here .\nIn other music news, a new interview with Frank Ocean has just surfaced online and it is glorious.
