I mean, probably it started right after she graduated from the Columbia university in May last year where initially it was well presumed that Karan Johar(Bollywood’s famous godfather) might launch her with Student Of The Year 2. But then that soon fizzled out after reports came suggesting how Sara’s mom Amrita Singh isn’t too keen on making her a part of a sequel in her very first film. Also read: Here’s why Amrita Singh asked Sara Ali Khan to DITCH a Karan Johar film \nThen came reports of Sara being in talks for KJo’s Fault In Our Stars remake but that again disappeared in the air with no trace of either Sara or Karan coming out with a clarification on the same. Finally, more recently we heard Sara has been signed opposite Hrithik Roshan for Karan Johar and Karan Malhotra’s film. It was almost confirmed where trade sources even revealed how Hrithik and Sara will not be seen playing lovers considering their age but will instead boast a rather different plot. However, much to everyone’s disappointment, news of Sara being dropped out of the film hit the web; while Hrithik too clarified there’s no truth to any such collaboration. In addition to this, Sara was suspiciously even spotted with Harshvardhan Kapoor and Saif and Kareena’s residence a few weeks back. Also read: Sara Ali Khan dropped out from Hrithik Roshan’s film? \nHowever, now a Mumbai Mirror report suggests there’s something off in all the above rumours considering how none of the films are taking off for Sara Ali Khan despite so much buzz. Is it because she isn’t liking the script or is there more to what meets the eye? Nevertheless, with one speculation to another, although Sara’s film is failing to take off but that clearly isn’t stopping her from making stunning appearances with every passing day. Not to mention, she is already an internet sensation despite not being personally active on social media. \nWe hope someone from the industry takes note of his beauty soon and locks her for a gorgeous film coz Sara deserves the best, isn’t it? Keep watching this space for more updates on Sara’s latest outings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:55:21.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
