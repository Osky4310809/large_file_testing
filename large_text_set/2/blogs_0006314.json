Roth vs. Traditional IRA: Which Is Right for You? will walk you through the differences and help you decide. \nIf you’ve been using being broke as an excuse to put off funding one of these accounts, here are six reasons to reconsider. – Rebecca Lake It Doesn’t Require a Huge Investment \nOne misconception that you need to banish about IRAs right away is that you need thousands of dollars to start saving. If you’re opening one through an online brokerage or a robo-advisor ​, it’s possible to get started with as little as $100. \nSetting up automatic contributions of $25 or $50 each payday lets you add to the total without taking a huge bite out of your take-home pay. (For more, see The Best Robo-Advisors for Beginner Investors. ) Compound Interest Can Grow Your Savings Faster \nCompound interest is a saver’s secret weapon, especially if you’re being consistent about adding to your IRA. \nHere’s an example: If you save $100 a month in an IRA starting at age 25 and continue that same amount until age 65, you’ll have contributed $48,000 total. If, however, you earn an average annual return of 7% over that time period, your savings will grow to more than $256,000, all through the power of compound interest. There Are Tax Breaks for Saving \nBeyond the growth potential of an IRA, saving can also benefit you at tax time. Contributions to a traditional IRA are tax deductible, for example. \nIf your salary is at the lower end of the scale ($31,000 or less for single filers and $62,000 or less for married filing jointly), you could qualify for the retirement saver’s credit . This is worth up to $2,000 for single filers and up to $4,000 for married couples filing jointly, as of 2017. Click here for details. You Can’t Bank on Social Security \nSocial Security can provide some of your income in retirement, but it’s not necessarily wise to pin all your hopes on these benefits. As of November 2016 the average monthly Social Security check for retirees was just over $1,300. \nIf you’re carrying a mortgage in retirement or facing mounting healthcare expenses, that can only go so far. Saving in an IRA can help to offset some of the financial burden down the line. (For more, see 10 Common Questions About Social Security. ) You Don’t Have to Be a Stock Market Expert \nAnother excuse people often use for not saving is assuming that you have to be a stock guru to save in an IRA. The reality is that choosing your investment options doesn’t require a degree in finance. \nMany online brokerages, for example, offer target-date funds , whose asset allocation is based on your target retirement year. Index funds and exchange-traded funds also allow for simple diversification across a broad mix of asset classes . It Can Help You Fight Inflation \nInflation can take a major bite out your income in retirement. According to LIMRA , a worldwide research, learning and development organization that serves more than 850 insurance and financial services companies, an inflation rate of just 2% can rob you of over $73,000 in purchasing power over a 20-year period. Between the tax advantages and the ability to earn higher returns through compound interest, saving in an IRA can help you combat the effects of inflation during your retirement years. The Bottom Line \nTaking the first step on the path toward saving for retirement can be scary, especially when your budget is tight, but it’s necessary for creating financial security in your later years. As you’re comparing your IRA options, take a look at how traditional and Roth accounts measure up in terms of the tax advantages. \nBeyond that, consider the investment options a particular brokerage offers, as well as the fees, so you’re choosing an IRA that offers the best combination of diversification and cost.
