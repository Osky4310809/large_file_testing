One man’s backpack contained mace, a loaded pistol – which he was licensed to carry – brass knuckles and a pocket knife. Police say they found knives and other weapons on some other protesters. \nOn Tuesday afternoon, it is a much different scene at the jail. Peaceful protesters sat outside of Pittsburgh Municipal Court. They hung two banners on the wall and were offering people coffee. KDKA’s Julie Grant tried to ask them what they are protesting, but a clear answer was never provided. \nHowever, the group has said they are protesting insufficient medical care for inmates. \nThe jail’s security wasn’t breached during Monday night’s incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:22:41.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
