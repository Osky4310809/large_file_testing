She mouthed ‘I love you’ and I knew she was in there.” \nJust two days later, Dr. Matt Wooten, at Mount Carmel West Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, came down to pallative care and was amazed at what he saw. \n“She opened her eyes and started talking to me,” he told the news outlet. “It really surprised me.” \nAfter he originally ruled out a brain infection, stroke and meningitis, he was at a loss for what was wrong. \n“We really didn’t know exactly what was going on,” he said. “We had a lot of suspicions, but it wasn’t really anything definite.” \nBarnette, from Mount Sterling, Ohio, knows she’s a walking miracle. \n“They didn’t see any chance of me coming out of this and they thought it would be best to just let me go,” she told WCMH. “I have a lot of fight in me and it keeps me going.” \nIt was only after she was then transferred to Meadow Grove Transitional Care Center that she started to make significant progress and was able to stand up. \n“If it wasn’t for the therapy department, I don’t think I would have made it,” Barnette said. “No matter what happens to you, don’t give up hope.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T18:16:05.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
