Several films have already debuted this year which comment on growing bureaucratic snafus, and handful of films have now found themselves addressing political controversies inadvertently. 20th Century Fox will soon be dropping one such film when Logan makes its way into theaters. And, now, the stars of the superhero blockbuster are speaking out about the movie’s serendipitous take on politics. \nTalking to Variety , both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart were asked how Logan aligns with the U.S. and its new administration under Trump. Jackman did stress Logan was by no means a political film, but the star did say there is some overlap between the two things. Since Logan does begin with Wolverine and Professor Xavier hiding out across the border in Mexico, Jackman said the locale was written into the film before border security became a hot topic in the U.S. \n“Before the whole debate about the wall, the border scenes were there in the film,” Jackman explained. \nStewart also chimed in, explaining that the film carries echoes of present-day politics. “We are affected by the changing times. You present your part as a person influenced by the times. We did not set out to make a political movie, yet there are echoes in the film that exist today – that is serendipity. If people want to take messages from this film, then we have done a good job,” the star said. \nAre you excited to see Logan ? Let us know how hyped you are with our anticipation rankings ! Currently, the film is #6 on our site! \nLogan takes place in the year 2029, where mutant births have become extremely rare. The defenders of mutant kind, the X-Men , are long gone, and the only remains of them are an old and struggling Charles Xavier and a weary Logan. Logan's vaunted healing factor has slowed, and at times doesn't seem to work at all. When a young mutant needs his help, Logan has to unsheathe his claws once more. His job isn't over yet.
