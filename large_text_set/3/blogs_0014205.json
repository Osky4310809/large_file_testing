I personally enjoyed the end of the track; specifically Lil Uzi’s lyrics:\n\nAdvertisement \n\n﻿Gotta go now, gotta go\n\nSwervin’ in my whip can’t slow down\nDriving fancy cars, boy I’m on the road now\nAutomatic start, my Vic take a code now\nYeah, rockstar, heavy metal, no guitar\nWhy you pay so much for your Nissan? Because it’s GTR\nFirst I shift it, click it, burning rubber like I’m moving dark\nDrive at night, I chop my top so I can relate to the stars\nYeah, relate to the stars\nI’ma race you for a pink slip\nI got nitrous in my car so tell me what you thinkin’\nMy adrenaline start pumpin’ so I been stopped blinkin’\nAutomatic start my Vic take a code now, indeed. \n\nWhy you pay so much for your Nissan?
