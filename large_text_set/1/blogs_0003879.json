It happens too often, and what makes it worst is that, many times, there are bystanders who could help, but choose not to. If cops are called, they either take the situation lightly, or arrive when it's too late. \nIn a situation so dreary for women in our country, Commonwealth Games gold medallist Krishna Poonia, a 39-year-old woman, gave us all a glimmer of hope by coming forward to help two girls being harassed in a small town in Haryana. \nThe incident took place around 4 pm, when Poonia noticed three bullies on a motorbike troubling the young girls. She got out of her car, and confronted the goons, who fled. But Poonia didn't stop at that. She chased them down until she hauled one of them off the bike. \nWhen asked what made her do this, she said, \"When I saw the two girls being harassed, I thought they could well have been my daughters. That made me go after the men.\" \nIf only everybody thought like this, the world would be a much better place!
