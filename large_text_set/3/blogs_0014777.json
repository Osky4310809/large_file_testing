He is an advocate of open relationships. He’s had group sex and sex with married women. He has sent and received intimate texts and pictures, and occasionally recorded video during sex. \n“Noah has always been forthright with his partners. All of his relationships have been legal and consensual, never coercive, or abusive, and he condemns such behavior. Noah is unapologetic about his sexual choices, and wishes others the same safety and confidence as they express themselves.” \nThe bold revelations have garnered widespread media coverage in recent weeks, and an outpouring of comment from potential voters. \n“Thank you, for challenging the unreasonably rigid standards of what amounts to a candidate being practically non-sexual and perfect in every way,” Ruby Garner wrote on Facebook . \n“I like your style. And for the record - I don't see 'scandals' or 'misdeeds', I see a sexually active, open and honest person. Would definitely consider voting for you, if only I lived in AZ.” \nHowever Talia Fuentes said she was not interested in hearing about his sex life if he lacked political knowledge. \n“Noah do you even know your win number, voter data, scores, demographics, anything? Do you know anything about legislative districts, congressional district, party chairs, or the democratic structure?\" she wrote. \n“I don't care about your sex life but if you don't know this info or these numbers you shouldn't be running.” Read more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T14:57:34.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
