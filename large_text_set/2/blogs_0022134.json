The woman rocks the saris she sports in the show and looks quite graceful while she is at it – no wonder she is one of the most popular TV actresses! \nRecently, for the launch party of her co-star Anita Hassanandani and her husband Rohit Reddy ‘s business venture, The Bag Talk, Divyanka stepped out looking rather different from her usual self. And she looked quite sexy, TBH!
