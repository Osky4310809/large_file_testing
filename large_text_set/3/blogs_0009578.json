And it would pay for it by diverting spending from other programs. In a press release announcing the ballot initiative, the Independence Institute singled out for cuts subsidies for film makers and electric vehicles, along with public transit programs such a the Bustang commuter bus service. \nIn contrast, the proposed House Bill 1242 — which also would require voter approval at the ballot box — would increase the statewide sales tax from 2.9 percent to 3.52 percent in order to generate $702 million a year. It would also cut vehicle registration fees by $75 million, and use $50 million of existing revenue to help make bond payments. \nThe path to the Colorado ballot is a complicated one, rife with procedural hurdles and potential legal challenges, so there’s no guarantee Friday’s filing will wind up on the ballot. But the attempt is a notable one. It would effectively give voters a choice between competing transportation initiatives — one referred by a conservative grassroots signature-gathering effort, and one by lawmakers. \nVoters last year approved a measure making it more difficult to change the state constitution through the ballot initiative process, but statutory ballot initiatives like this one were unaffected.
