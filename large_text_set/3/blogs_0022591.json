Although Diebenkorn was born 50 years after Matisse, he had an enduring fascination with the older painter. Diebenkorn incorporated Matisse’s techniques, style and use of color into his paintings, and often traveled as far as St. Petersburg and Paris to view Matisse’s work. SFMOMA curator Janet Bishop joins us to talk about these two artists and how, side-by-side, their work tells a story of study and inspiration.\n\nMore Information on the Matisse/Diebenkorn Exhibit ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:56:43.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
