Rucker was driving the vehicle, while Simpson was a passenger. \nSimpson attempted to run away during the traffic stop, but the officer apprehended him a short distance from the vehicle, police said. He was found to be in possession of two weapons, a .40-caliber Smith and Wesson with a loaded magazine and a loaded .22-caliber Walther P22 with a laser sight attached and a loaded magazine. The Walther P22 had been reported stolen from West Virginia. \nSimpson, of Chicago Heights, has been ordered held at the Cook County Jail on a $20,000 bond, court records show. Rucker, of South Holland, was ordered held on a $3,000 bond. They are both due back in court Jan. 24. \n(Source: Sun-Times Media Wire © Chicago Sun-Times 2017. All Rights Reserved.
