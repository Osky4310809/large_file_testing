We were hunting for all sorts of make-up and hair trends through the day and were not disappointed at all. We noticed that make-up has been kept minimal and the focus is always on one feature; whether it's eyes or lips rocking in that zone. A fair play of funky accessories and hairdos was also being made. Here are some of the best beauties we found on #Day2 of fashion week! \n1. Smokey eyes for the day! \n2. Strong lash game. \n4. Keeping it cool with some retro sunglasses. \n5. Bold lips part 1! \n6. Bold lips part 2! \n7. No make-up, neat hair and statement accessories, all the way. \n8. Highlighted cheekbones and red lips, FTW. \n9. The no-makeup makeup vibe is going strong! \n10.
