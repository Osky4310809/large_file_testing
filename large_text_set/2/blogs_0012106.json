A review of its make up shows that the vehicle has something unique for SUV lovers. For instance, many reviewers note that some sport utility vehicles have the capacity to move a large family, offering sophisticated features, providing comfort and luxury but not all can tow a trailer. The 2017 edition of Lexus LX 570 does not only tow a truck but combines that with a sophisticated four-wheel-drive system, fancy leather seats and wood grain on the dash board. Built on time-tested Toyota Land Cruiser architecture, the 2017 Lexus LX 570 is a big three-row SUV with the capability to travel pretty much anywhere, says Edmund.com , in its review of the view. It is a full-size SUV that can seat eight passengers. Its third-row seat is a 50/50-split design that folds up against the sides of the cargo compartment when not in use. It comes with a standard and capable four-wheel-drive system, and the ability to tow heavy trailers. This formula has kept the LX 570 at the forefront of luxury SUVs for quite some time. But this comes with a price, according to the online reviewer – poor fuel economy. Interior comfort It has a semi-aniline perforated leather-trimmed interior. This is explained as extremely soft perforated leather, dyed all the way through, unlike leathers with conventional surface dyes. The automaker says the vehicle also has 14-way driver’s and 12-way front passenger’s power-adjustable seats. It adds that the LX 570’s commanding comfort comes from the multi-adjustable power front seats. The 14-way driver’s seat (which includes dual-function lumbar support) and the 12-way passenger’s seat both feature a memory function to recall your preferred settings with the touch of a button. In addition, headrests are height-adjustable for all seating positions and power-adjustable in the front, it adds. It says the power rear door offers remote keyless access to the rear storage area. The rear door can be raised and lowered from inside the vehicle by using a switch, or remotely with the SmartAccess fob “Unlike anything else in the world, the stunning design of the available Linear Dark Mocha or Linear Espresso steering wheel and matching trim combines the organic feel of natural wood with a layered look that evokes modern art. The result of 67 steps of craftsmanship over 38 days, the wheel is formed from many layers of thinly cut wood, bonded together and meticulously shaped and buffed to align with the look of the wood on the instrument panel.” Exterior According to The LX 570 is offered in a single trim level with a long list of high-end standard features. The LX comes with 20-inch wheels, a height-adjustable adaptive suspension, automatic load levelling, full LED exterior lights (automatic and adaptive LED headlights, foglights and taillights), automatic wipers, auto-dimming and power-folding mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, a 360-degree surround-view parking camera system, a blind-spot monitoring system, rear cross-traffic alert, a lane departure warning system, adaptive cruise control, a sunroof, running boards, a roof rack, a power liftgate, a tow hitch, rear privacy glass, and keyless ignition and entry. Safety The automaker says the most comprehensive safety system ever offered on Lexus is Lexus Safety System, which is designed to help pave the way to a world with fewer collisions and better-informed drivers. An integrated suite of advanced safety systems, the Lexus Safety System+ is designed to help maintain safe distances between vehicles and alert you of potential collisions, under certain conditions. The vehicle has Lexus Enform Safety Connect, which offers you the peace of mind of knowing that Roadside Assistance will be there when you need it most. “Whether you’re involved in a collision and unable to call for help, your vehicle is stolen, or there is any other type of emergency, assistance can be sent directly to your vehicle’s GPS location. Lexus Enform Safety Connect is complimentary for the first year of ownership,” it says. Activated with the press of a button, Crawl Control is designed to automatically maintain an optimal slow and steady pace over challenging terrain. A Turn Assist feature can also tighten your turning circle by adding brake force to the inside rear wheel. It also has an Advanced Multi-View Monitor using high-resolution cameras mounted on the front, sides, rear and undercarriage of the LX to give drivers a bird’s-eye view of the near environment as on-screen guides help assist with parking and tight manoeuvring, especially during demanding off-road excursions. The Hill-Start Assist Control is another safety feature that helps to increase the driver’s confidence when ascending hills. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
