Lamar Smith, R-Texas speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File) The Associated Press \nBy Marianna Brady \nThe House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday that would that restrict the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to use certain types of scientific studies, a restraint that Republicans say is needed to stop unnecessary regulations the cost private companies millions of dollars. RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Coal vs. Climate? ] \nBut Democrats said the measure, called the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act, handcuffs the EPA and has the potential for abuse. The American Lung Association, National Medical Association and the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America are among the groups that opposed for the bill Monday in a letter to Congress. \nThe bill, which was approved 228-194, would prohibit the EPA from proposing actions unless supported by science that is publicly available. \n\"The days of 'trust-me' science are over,\" said House Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas. \"This legislation ensures that sound science is the basis for EPA decisions and regulatory actions.\" \nRepublicans said that the bill will increase EPA transparency and cut the number of unnecessary regulations that cost businesses millions of dollars and take away jobs.

David Schweikert, R-Ariz., and demanded that Democrats \"stop being afraid of people having access to information.\" \nBut Rep. Eddie Bernice Johns, D-Texas, said the measure \"is a Pandora's Box which could have untold consequences for the EPA, industry and the general public.\" \nCritics said the EPA would be prohibited from making regulatory decisions based on peer-reviewed research studies that involve information that cannot be made public, like medical records, severely limiting the data available to EPA regulators. \nThe vote on the bill, which still needs Senate approval, followed a House Science, Space and Technology Committee meeting in which Smith said \"much of climate science today appears to be based more on exaggerations, personal agendas and questionable predictions than on the scientific method.\" Paul D.
