There’s now a newer version — the PFM A5 v2.0 . It is over a meter long, weighs about 10 kilograms, and features a mind-boggling number of gears and moving parts. Video is embedded below.\nIn one end travels one sheet of paper after the next. At each stage in the process the paper is folded (symmetrically) and creased by a vertical wheel to make up the keel of the finished plane before launching out the other end. Amazing, and not a jam or “PC Load Letter” error message in sight!\nThis, of course, has a purpose… junk ads from the sky !\n\n\nWe covered an earlier version of this paper airplane gun back in 2014; the original was a marvel of engineering and this new version is no different.\nThere is very little that Dieter Michael Krone doesn’t know about paper airplanes. He has even written a comprehensive book (in German) with some excerpts on his site, along with a gallery of some of his work.\nThanks for the tip, [Itay]!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:52:42.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
