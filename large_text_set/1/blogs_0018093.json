The latest excuse was that his gates had stuck but he couldn't jump over a fence that was four feet six inches high. \n\"There has been too much indiscipline at this club for way too long.\" \nMcCormack has managed just three goals so far this season and Bruce admitted he was so fed up that he had abandoned his usual policy of not discussing disciplinary issues with the media. \nVerratti gets strangest yellow card of 2017 \n\"Not in 20 years of management have I gone down this road of publicly shaming a player but I have to make a stand because I won’t put up with it,\" he added. \"Not on my watch. \n\"I ask only one thing. When I tell them they are in, everyone else is in. How can I pick him when he doesn't want to come training? \n\"It's happened more than once. Everyone can have an excuse for one occasion but when it is more than that I will not accept it.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:58:43.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
