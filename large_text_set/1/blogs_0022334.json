But before you grab your pitchforks and flaming torches, rest easy: it’s Chinese New Year and the betas will resume in a month.\nSee also: This is Android Nougat on the OnePlus 3 December 3, 2016 That said, there is still reason for a little pitchfork-wielding, with the January security patch from Google still MIA. Considering the imminent holiday period (starting January 28) it seems likely it will be skipped entirely in favor of the February patch next month. We’ve reached out to OnePlus for clarification on this point and will update this post with any news.\nSecurity patches aside, there is still quite a lengthy laundry-list of bugs in the current Nougat builds for both devices, which you can get up to speed with here . The feedback page is also the best place to go if you’re experiencing any issues with the firmware you’re currently running on a OnePlus device – as with most bug trackers, the more folks reporting a particular bug the more likely it is to get addressed quickly.\nOf course, if the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T aren’t getting any new builds in the next month, you can guarantee the OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X won’t either. OnePlus has vowed to get updates out faster this year and to ship devices more quickly too, so take a deep breath, relax, and save that venom for later. Knowing OnePlus, they’ll give you reason enough to spit some soon enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T14:46:57.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
