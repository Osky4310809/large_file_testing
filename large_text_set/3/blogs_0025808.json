Strong, fast, good with the feet and had the passion. If you have a player who has all those, he will become Steven Gerrard. \nBest Hair: \"I'm not going to say mine, I was always happy with mine, but I will say Milan Baros. He was always there with the band, all the hair spray every game, so yeah I will say Milan Baros. Milan Baros always took good care of his hair, says Garcia (Photo: Getty) Read More Liverpool to deny offering forbidden inducement in bid to sign Stoke City starlet \nWorst Hair: Robbie was already losing some of his hair! We won't tell him, but it didn't look good. \nHard Man: John Arne Riise. Ginge, he was always in the gym, looking tough, so yeah I will say him. \nFittest: Momo Sissoko. I was surprised by how much he was running. He was running 12 or 13 kilometers every single game, he was a crazy, crazy player. \nWorst Taste In Music: Probably Djibril Cisse. He was all day with the r'n'b and rap and it was hard to take for more than 10 minutes. \nBest Singer: I will say Crouchie, because it's not that he's got a nice voice, but he was signing all day, so yeah I will say him. Peter Crouch is known more for his moves than his voice, with his famous robot celebration (Photo: PA) \nBest Passer: I will say the pass-master Xabi Alonso, of course. \nBest Tackler: We have to say Jamie Carragher, because he loved it \nBest Dressed: Djibril Cisse, but also I will say Harry Kewell. \nWorst Dressed: I will say Didi Hamann, because he just doesn't care about anything. Djibril Cisse for... best dressed?! (Photo: Unknown) \nBest Dancer: Djibril Cisse, he had some quite good moves. \nWorst Dancer: Crouch! The robot arrived later, so Peter Crouch.
