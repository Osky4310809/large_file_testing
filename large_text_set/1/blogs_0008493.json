Ronaldo and Sir Alex have a chat (Photo: Getty) \nUnited were not the 31-year-old's only former club to pass on their best wishes, as Sporting Lisbon also sent out a tweet complete with a snap of a very youthful looking Ronaldo playing in their colours. \nThey posted: \"Congratulations, @Cristiano! #MadeInSporting #TheBest.\" \nFormer Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack also passed on his congratulations, including an image of the German in his Blues days alongside Ronaldo in a Manchester United tie. \nRonaldo posed for a picture with former Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson backstage after winning the award. \nThe pair have retained a strong relationship since Ronaldo's departure from United, often respectfully talking about one another in public.

It’s incredible,\" he said. It’s not the first time but this award is the first time. \n\"I want first to thank my team-mates, my coach. I want to thank my family, my whole staff. \n\"I tell you, 2016 was the best year of my career. I had a lot of doubts but the trophy showed that I lived up to that. \n\"After I won what I did, I had no doubts. \n\"It was a year that was magnificent on a personal level, on a sports level. I would like to thank very warmly everybody who voted for me. To the fans, to the other players, to the media: thank you.\" \nRonaldo himself took to Twitter after receiving the award, commenting: \"Delighted to win The Best FIFA award. Wouldn't be possible without my teammates, coaches and you who support me every day. Thanks everyone!\" \nThe Portuguese superstar was part of a Real Madrid contingent at the awards which included Sergio Ramos, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Marcelo, all of who were included in the FIFPro World XI of the Year. \nBoss Zinedine Zidane was also present, but the Frenchman missed out on Coach of the Year to Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri.
