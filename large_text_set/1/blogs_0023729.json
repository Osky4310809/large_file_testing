Shapira overlaid the smiling figures onto old photographs taken at concentration camps. The website has gone viral since going online on Wednesday. Photo: Yolocaust.de \nThe disturbing photos also showed a couple taking a selfie in front of two starving young men. \nThrough his project, the satirist conveyed the message to the visitors, saying, \"I'm watching you. Stop doing it.\" \nAccording to reports, all 12 people whose selfies Shapira used in the project had contacted him and apologised for their discourteous behaviour. They had also removed inappropriate photos from their social media sites and private websites.

The pictures were merged with photographs from concentration camps. Photo: Yolocaust.de \n\"It is not the camp itself. It is not the sacred ground. It is a ground of remembrance and you can choose to remember in many ways, or not remember. \n\"It's become part of the fabric of the city,\" Eisenman said, and added that rather than this we should concentrate on growing power of the German right-wing, and such a memorial might not be approved in the first place now. \nThe Holocaust Memorial also known as the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe is a memorial in Berlin to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust. \nThe monument – which is built on the former location of the Berlin Wall – where the \"death strip\" once divided the city, is situated near the Brandenburg Gate. It comprises 2,711 tombstone-like slabs of granite of varying heights. It is often used by visitors for picnics, yoga and other activities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T02:41:40.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
