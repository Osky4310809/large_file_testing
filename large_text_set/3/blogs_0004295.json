Trump alleges Obama had Trump phones wiretapped during race \nSome of the biggest cheers Salcedo drew came from his response to an audience question regarding his thoughts on Trump's call for an investigation into Sen. Chuck Schumer and his involvement with Russia. \n\"If we're going to criminalize talking with the Russians, let's do it,\" Salcedo said. \"If we're going to go down that road, let's go down that road. Our current president will stand against the Russians where our former president kissed their rears.\" Spirit of America rally happening now in Southlake is one of many going on nationally today pic.twitter.com/HipQHmdOeH — Claire Ballor (@claireballor) March 4, 2017 \nCrowds also cheered as speakers called for Trump supporters to no longer sit back as the \"silent majority,\" but to be vocal with their beliefs and support. \nMark Shackelford, the lead organizer of the rally, said the point of this event and the ones to follow is to \"publicly support President Trump.\" Fran Rhodes asks talk show host Chris Salcedo a question about Obamacare at a rally in Southlake. \n(Robert W.
