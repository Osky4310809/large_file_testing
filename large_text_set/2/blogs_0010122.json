While there always going to be people who say the big winners didn’t deserve it , I am not that kind of person — I’m more of a \"general hatred\" kind of guy. With that in mind, here are my specific reasons for really hating some best Best Picture winners. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) \nI mean, just look at that title; this is a movie filled with very good performances that is also so annoyingly self-important. I mean, any time a movie is about the struggle of the artist, you’re almost surely in for a real wankfest, but Birdman really takes the cake. The director, Alejandro González Iñárritu, is a really interesting guy, but oh boy, he needs to settle down about himself a little bit. Forrest Gump \nForrest Gump is maybe the most cynical movie that I’ve ever seen. It's about a dumb guy who is beloved and constantly rewarded throughout life, simply because he is so committed to not taking a stand or acting boldly in any way. Meanwhile, his dear friend and love Jenny endures all manner of abuse and violence, simply because she has a dream and is also active in causes like the struggle for civil rights. THANK GOD SHE GOT HERS Also, this movie stole Best Picture from Pulp Fiction , one of the best and most important films of the '90s. Gandhi \nGandhi is itself a perfectly fine movie; a little long and also committed to sanding off some of the very rough edges of Gandhi’s life, but it’s no more guilty of that than hundreds of other acclaimed movies. My beef with Gandhi (the movie, not the guy, no one email my editors hate mail about me) is that it spawned a still-coming stream of award-bait biopics that are obnoxiously similar and obnoxiously boring. Free us from our yearly deluge of boring movies about real people that include none of the more interesting details about them! The Sound of Music \nIs the sound of music just loud snoring? Because The Sound of Music is boring as hell. Like, SO boring. Everything you remember about this movie? It’s like ten minutes of the film, and then you have to sit through the other fifty million hours of movie that you do not give a rat’s ass about. Also, it really seems like the actor playing the father and the actor playing the oldest daughter have a weird romantic chemistry. I don’t like that. Argo \nBEN AFFLECK IS NOT EVEN HISPANIC, AND THE CANADIANS HAD A MUCH MORE INTEGRAL ROLE THAN THIS MOVIE WOULD LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE! Also, it starts off seeming like it will actually be an intelligent portrayal of the tensions in Iran, but just dissolves into another \"angry brown people\" portrayal. Million Dollar Baby \nThis movie is just so damned schmaltzy. Every moment of it feels like a cliché a screenwriting teacher would roll their eyes at and scribble in the margins \"REWRITE THIS!\". Beyond those issues, though, in the interests of avoiding massive spoilers, let’s just say this movie is a disability advocate’s nightmare. \nLet me know about your very specific beefs with things on Twitter , because I LOVE ‘EM!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:09:44.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
