Respondents were invited to complete the online survey in either French or English.\nThe survey found that Canadians have what Donnelly described as an “impressive” knowledge of Canada’s immigration and refugee system and that most are satisfied with Canada’s multiculturalist approach to immigration policy.\nThese results suggest that a serious anti-immigrant movement is not impossible\nAnd yet, as Donnelly writes in the study, “Whatever is driving Canada’s exceptionally positive history of immigration and integration over the last half century, it does not appear to be an exceptionally tolerant public.”\nIndeed, Canada was neither most tolerant nor most intolerant but was around average compare to Europe and the U.S. on issues, for example, of how generous countries ought to be when considering a refugee application or whether immigrants from poor countries ought be accepted.\nBut any tolerance by Canadians to be more generous towards refugees and immigrants is “soft” in the sense that, as Donnelly argues, there are a great many who could do not have strong opinions one way or the other.\nFor example, the survey found what Donnelly described as “surprisingly weak” opposition to the idea of stopping all immigration to Canada.\nWhile about 45 per cent of those surveyed would oppose any policy that would end all immigration, just under 20 per cent would support such a policy while nearly 35 per cent said they would neither oppose nor support such a policy.\n“These results suggest that a serious anti-immigrant movement is not impossible,” Donnelly wrote.\nRelated Trump’s immigration ban ‘will affect our debate’: Tory leadership candidates Quebec mosque attack increases odds MPs will take on the study of Islamophobia, religious hate crimes Justin Trudeau finds allies across political lines in signalling disapproval of Trump’s travel ban Just over half of those surveyed agreed with the statement “too many immigrants don’t seem to feel connected to Canadian society,” while better than two of three Canadians believe immigrants should change their behaviour to be more like Canadians once they arrive here.\nFor Donnelly, those data points are warning signs.\n“There are some good things going on in Canada and there are some potential problems,” Donnelly said in a telephone interview Monday. “There’s room there for growth of serious intolerance if people aren’t careful.”\nThe study, titled Canadian Exceptionalism: Are We Good Or Are We Lucky? — it shares a name with a two-day conference MISC is staging in Montreal this Thursday and Friday, which will further explore the theme — also touches on current political debates by trying to measure differences in attitudes on immigration and refugees between supporters of Canada’s three main political parties.\nOne of the dominant themes of the Conservative leadership race has been immigration and refugee policy, a theme purposefully put at the heart of that race by MP and leadership hopeful Kellie Leitch who favours new restrictions based on still-to-be-explained “Canadian values” test.\nBrett Gundlock / National Post Nick Kouvalis in 2010 when he was campaign manager for Rob Ford. Indeed, before he resigned as Leitch’s campaign manager, Nick Kouvalis, who runs a public opinion research firm, predicted that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s policies on refugee and immigration would lead to a Liberal defeat at the next general election in 2019.\nThat said, supporters of all three major parties — Liberals, Conservatives, and New Democrats — seemed to prefer the status quo when it comes to current immigration levels. But there were clear differences of opinion when it came to the size of Canada’s annual refugee program.\nSurvey respondents who identified themselves as Liberal supporters believe it a positive attribute for their party to advocate and support a small — 1,000 persons a year — to moderate — 25,000 persons a year — refugee program, but were not supportive of a large — 50,000-a-year — program.\nConservative respondents had negative views for all sizes of a refugee program. New Democrats, too, were negative on a moderate to large refugee agreement but see a small refugee program of between 1,000 and 10,000 a year as a positive attribute for that party to include in a campaign platform.\n• Email: dakin@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidakin \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:10:37.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
