After CNN’s Jim Acosta, who asked the original question, tried to cut in to say the news isn’t always going to be positive, Spicer fired back: “It’s not always gotta be negative.” \n“ Some days we do do the right thing, some days we are successful. Part of this is saying, when we’re right, say we’re right. When we’re wrong, say we’re wrong,” he said. \nMeanwhile: Trump has not released his tax returns and, according to his perma-spokesperson Kellyanne Conway, he has no plans to do so . On Trump’s first weekday in office, he banished the Monday blues by signing an anti-abortion measure while surrounded by a group of white men. \nYeah, it’s definitely the narrative that’s negative, not the news.
