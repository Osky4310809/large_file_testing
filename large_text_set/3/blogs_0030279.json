They wore the colors purple and white in protest of the flyers. Some made shirts with the female symbol in duct tape. UPDATE for everyone I did not get called to admin and the principal apologized. Also our student body really showed unity today! pic.twitter.com/U7UZ3gR3pv \n— Lily (@LILwillingham) March 28, 2017 \nFortunately the school agreed with the students, and quickly took steps to remove the posters and issue an apology. \nThe school district issued a public statement saying the flyers were “not an approved policy by the school or Duval County Public Schools” and that the flyers were “immediately removed” Monday by school administrators. “Please do accept my apology for this poor delivery of information. Our intent is to make sure prom is enjoyable and memorable,” Stanton College Prep Principal Nongongoma Majova-Seane said. \n“Both students and staff have been informed this was not acceptable or appropriate guidance for prom dress attire,” reads the statement. The display of prom dress photos at Stanton College Prep is not appropriate or an approved policy. Images were removed on Mon. #SCPgoodgirl \n— DCPS (@DuvalSchools) March 28, 2017 \nIt’s baffling that anyone in the school administration ever thought using the words “good girl” was appropriate. But the amazing thing here is how this group of students united together in order to effect change. Willingham told First Coast News that once the students explained to the administration why they found the flyers so offense, they were quick to own up to their mistake. “They didn’t quite see the issue about it being demeaning to women,” she said. “So once they did realize that that offended us and that we weren’t okay with that they were like, ‘Oh wow, we didn’t see it that way,’ and they apologized.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T15:26:32.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
