We are always up against an opponent who also wants to do well and do their best to win games. Teams did that very well against us during January and we had our problems.

I don’t know if it was a lack of consistency or what it was, but I do know that every one of us wants to win every game no matter who it is against, and we know that we have the quality to do well.

It will be a hard fight to the finish as there are a lot of teams competing for those top four positions. \n“We have to do everything we possibly can to get back to where we want to be.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:00:23.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
