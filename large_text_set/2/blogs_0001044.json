Per WhoScored.com, in terms of shot-stopping, Handanovic is one of the best in Serie A: WhoScored.com @WhoScored Best save success in Serie A this term (50+ shots): Da Costa (81.4%) Szczesny (80.7%) Donnarumma (76.5%) Handanovic (75.6%) Skorupski (75.6) 1/16/2017, 3:44:18 PM There's more to the Inter man's game than the average 'keeper. While he is adept at clawing shots out of corners, he's also a commanding presence in the box and a smart distributor. He's also excellent when it comes to facing set pieces; Handanovic has stopped seven penalty kicks since the start of the 2014-15 season, according to Transfermarkt . He looks as though he'd be an upgrade on Mignolet. The Belgium international has been in decent form overall this term, although there's a sense that if Liverpool are keen to push on and challenge for the top honours, a 'keeper of world-class pedigree is needed. Mignolet has been hit and miss during his time with the Reds. Alex Livesey/Getty Images Mignolet's Liverpool career was epitomised in Tuesday ' s 1-1 draw with Chelsea . First he was caught off guard embarrassingly for David Luiz's opening goal, and then in the second half, he sprung into action to stop a Diego Costa penalty. Tony Barrett of Joe.co.uk summed up the goalkeeper's evening: Tony Barrett @TonyBarrett Good save by Mignolet who benefitted from looking at the shot as it was taken. That could catch on. Plenty at Anfield have high hopes for Karius, although when he was made first choice by Klopp, he struggled. Still, he's clearly a talented goalkeeper, and at 23, he has a lot of developing to do. Karius didn't grasp his chance earlier in the season. Matthew Ashton - AMA/Getty Images Of the two current goalkeepers available to Klopp, it's the German who has the higher ceiling and the brighter long-term future. For now, though, Mignolet is a safer bet, and given the Reds are in a fight to secure a UEFA Champions League spot, it's likely he'll be entrusted with the gloves for the remainder of the season. If Liverpool are in the Champions League and do want to challenge for the Premier League title in 2017-18, a goalkeeper of Handanovic's calibre is required. But given just how crucial he is to this Inter side, it's likely he would be a costly purchase.
