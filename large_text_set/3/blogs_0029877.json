Jael appeared on the eighth cycle of America's Next Top Model in 2007 But by 2012 she was homeless, addicted to meth and stripping to make money (Photo: CBS) \nBut an intervention in 2012 by TV host Dr Phil helped Jael get her life back on track, even though she had to be coaxed into seeking help while hiding behind a dumpster as the show's cameras rolled. \n\"I'm the happiest I've ever been in my entire life,\" she told TooFab this week. \n\"This journey was very unexpected. I've been sober for three years and three months now. Not a drink, not a pill, not a joint, not a line, nothing.\" Jael has been sober since going to rehab (Photo: eureka.secrets/Instagram) She says it's a miracle she's still alive (Photo: eureka.secrets/Instagram) \nShe went on: \"It's really amazing. It's a huge miracle to still be breathing after what I was up to and I'm so grateful. Whatever path and twists and turns I had to take to get here, I don't regret any of them.\" \nJael, who had to deal with the death of her friend while appearing on the eighth cycle of ANTM, revealed that another of Tyra Bank's hand-picked reality show models reached out to her while she was battling drugs. \nRenee Alway – who is now serving a 12-year jail sentence for possession of a firearm and burglary charges – had called Jael after she came out of rehab to offer her support. Jael had support from fellow ANTM contestant Renee (Photo: eureka.secrets/Instagram) She says she hasn't touched drugs in over three years (Photo: eureka.secrets/Instagram) \n\"This was before she was incarcerated and she alluded to the fact that she really sympathised with the situation and she understood more than I knew,\" said Jael. \n\"We're both lesbians, we were both closeted and we both had drug problems. We spent some time together and got a real relationship.\" \nJael isn't the only one to have experienced personal trauma since leaving America's Next Top Model. \nCycle 5 hopeful Lisa D'Amato had to go to rehab for her drug and alcohol addiction, but got clean and ended up winning Cycle 17 of the show. \nTragically, Cycle 21's Mirjana Puhar was killed along with her boyfriend and his roommate in February 2015.
