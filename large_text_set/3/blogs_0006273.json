Patterson later married Lewis’ widow, Cady (above). Matthew Hintz Brian Bartlett / BCreative Tulsa (bcreativetulsa.com) In March of 2014, Cady Patterson was devastated when her 23-year-old husband, Jordan Lewis, died after a three-year battle with sinus cancer.\n“My heart is heavy. My heart is torn. I’ve been hit,” Cady, then a 24-year-old church administrator based in Tulsa, Okla., wrote on her blog .\nFour months after Jordan’s death, Cady took a girls’ trip with her college buddies to Charleston, NC, to help heal her heartache. There she enlisted her late husband’s childhood friend, Charleston native Jonathan Patterson, as a tour guide.\nHe’d been an usher at Cady and Jordan’s wedding, but he and Cady hadn’t known each other well. Over three days, they bonded in their grief as Jonathan, now 28, took the women sailing and out to the best restaurants in town.\n“I didn’t know Cady that well when she was dating Jordan, but she seemed like a great girl,” says Jonathan, a seminary student.\nThe two started talking on the phone every week and regularly texting. A month into their new friendship, Jonathan realized he had romantic feelings for Cady.\nLast week, the country was shocked when The Post reported that Joe Biden’s son Hunter, was having an affair with Hallie , the widow of Hunter’s older brother, Beau, who passed away from brain cancer in May 2015. But such an arrangement is common in some cultures and throughout history; in the Bible it’s referred to as levirate marriage, in which the brother of a dead man marries his brother’s widow.\nHunter Biden’s relationship with his late brother’s widow, Hallie, grabbed headlines last week. Today, experts say such relationships are more common than many realize. After the death of a loved one, their spouse is often drawn to their best friend or sibling.\n“It makes so much sense that for widows, the first people they’re drawn to are family or friends of the person they love,” says Kath McCormack, a grief counselor and adviser at California-based widow-support group Soaring Spirits , who has seen this phenomenon occur a handful of times. “They’ve been through so many similar things.”\nThat was certainly the case for Jonathan and Cady. When he moved to Minneapolis, Minn., for seminary school in August 2014, he consulted with his church about pursuing a relationship with his friend’s widow.\n“I sat and prayed about it for a month,” Jonathan says.\nIn October 2014, he and Cady met up at a mutual friend’s wedding in Syracuse, NY. He confessed his true feelings. Cady said that she felt the same way but needed to take it slow.\n“I was willing to wait as long as it [took] for her to be ready to be in a relationship,” Jonathan says.\nIt makes so much sense that for widows, the first people they’re drawn to are family or friends of the person they love.\nHe also realized that he needed to talk to Jordan’s family. In February 2015, he told his late friend’s dad about him and Cady. The grieving father asked him not to go public with the relationship until a year after Jordan’s death out of respect to the family, and he abided.\n“I understood the implications of getting into a relationship like this,” Jonathan says.\nIn April 2016, he asked Cady to marry him. In August, they were married in Tulsa, Okla., in a beautiful mansion. Jordan’s family supported the union, and his siblings even served as bridesmaids.\nBut these relationships can also be quite controversial and strain relationships.\nJonathan recalls feeling judged by strangers and acquaintances.\n“I remember a guy commenting on my blog saying [I] swooped in when she was mourning,” he says. “There’s a certain cynicism.”\nWidow Bethany Hunter can relate. In 2006, a year after her first husband, Christopher Lyon, was killed in Iraq, she married his best friend and squad leader, Jeff Hunter.\nJeff Hunter (wearing goggles) and Christopher Lyon in Iraq in 2005 When other military folk learned of their relationship, she was the subject of gossip at the annual Marine ball.\n“People … said that I didn’t love Christopher as much as a wife should because I got married so quickly,” Bethany says. “[Jeff] told me that it doesn’t matter what they say because what we have is real.”\nJeff was the first person Bethany reached out to after she learned of her first husband’s death. She had just given birth to her and Christopher’s first child, a girl named Bella, who would never meet her father. Jeff hadn’t just been Christopher’s close friend and squad leader, he had helped recover his body after he died during a firefight, an act for which he received a Silver Star.\n“Because our relationship was built on mutual grief and pain, it made our love stronger because we helped each other heal,” Bethany says.\nLeft: Bethanny Hunter wed Christopher Lyon in September 2003. In 2005, he was killed serving in Iraq. Right: In 2006, Bethanny married Christopher’s best friend and squad leader, Jeff Hunter, while clutching the 15-month-old daughter she’d had with Christopher, Bella. The couple now live in Albuquerque, NM, where Jeff works as a sheriff. They have four kids, including Bella and a son named Atticus Christopher, in honor of their dearly departed loved one.\nBella has asked about her father, but it’s Atticus, 10, who is most affected by the family history and the memory of his namesake.\n“He’s a very empathetic kid and carries some guilt about it,” Bethany says. “During Memorial Day, I get really emotional, and he usually gets sad or withdrawn, too. And we talk about it.”\nBut Bethany says she has no regrets about how she found love again.\n“I couldn’t be [Jeff’s] wife today without being Christopher’s widow first,” she says. “There isn’t a Hallmark card for us, but that’s OK, and our relationship doesn’t have to work for other people.”\nIt’s all relative: Famous couples with family ties \nKing George V and Mary of Teck In 1892, Prince Albert Victor of England died of pneumonia.
