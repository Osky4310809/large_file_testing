Mikey Garcia WBC champion Mikey Garcia has passed on advice to Crolla \nIt's just a matter of dictating the pace more, making sure that he's not standing in the pocket for too long, because that's where Linares gets his three or four-punch combinations off. \nEither you've got to dip in and out faster and move the head more, duck and spin around to avoid the counters from Linares. Linares will wait for Crolla to jump in and he counters with those combinations. If it was me, I would get in and out quicker and I think that's what Crolla needs to do. Adam Booth Adam Booth believes Crolla will be mentally stronger after first fight \nI think belief is a big, big thing. Like everyone, I thought Anthony admired Linares before the first fight because he is the sort you can admire, very easily. It can lead to a sub-conscience acceptance that he is better than you. But now he's shared the ring with him in a very competitive fight - I did think Linares won it - he can walk into this one with that confidence. Anthony Crolla says he will respond to everything Jorge Linares throws at him \nCrolla knowing what it's like being in with him. That is where that belief comes from and he has to have the confidence to make constant adjustments, because Linares has such a flow and is far from one-dimensional. One small thing that could have a big say is when Linares is looking for that space and thinking time, Anthony has got to cut down that time and get hold of those moments. Tony Bellew \nCrolla has to dictate the pace from the start. He cannot let Jorge Linares settle into a rhythm. A champion as good as Linares, with his punch selection, you cannot let him fight at his pace, because he will pick you apart. Crolla needs to take the fight by the scuff of the neck, set a high pace, really tire Linares and let the years of abuse to his body show. Tony Bellew \nCrolla needs to take the fight by the scuff of the neck, set a high pace, really tire Linares and let the years of abuse to his body show, because Linares has been in a lot of wars. Crolla might be the physically stronger man, but he's not technically better, so you have to fight to your strengths and make it uncomfortable from the word go. Crolla has sat down with trainer Joe Gallagher to review defeat against Linares Ricky Hatton Ricky Hatton hopes his fellow Mancunian can pull off a memorable victory \nOf course I will be cheering him on, but I just wonder how much Anthony can better that first fight and it did seem to take a little bit more out of him than Linares. But if it was up to me, I would get Ant increasing the work-rate and just do everything we know he does - but just that little bit better. \nFrom a real technical perspective, Linares loves those two straights and then go down to the body with a lovely left hook, but Ant knows what he does, so anticipating that and catching him with a right will make Linares weary of doing that again. Not getting tagged will help, of course. We are all praying Ant can win it and Linares has an off-day, but he has to make that happen as well. Jamie Moore \nIf you try to change too much, then it will have a negative impact on Anthony Crolla's gameplan, but I would use slightly different angles. When he eventually got Linares to hold his feet a little on the ropes, if he shifts his body a little to the right, he could have made a little more room for his right hand over the top. If you try to change too much, then it will have a negative impact on Anthony Crolla's game-plan, but I would use slightly different angles. Jamie Moore \nIn the middle part of the fight when Crolla was just getting a foothold, he was a little bit lax with his defence, and allowed himself to be caught with that right hand, which was a key moment in the fight. If he can avoid one of those moments in this fight, then it will be a lot closer. David Coldwell \nCrolla has got to make sure that Linares does not get his big shots off. When Crolla was taking body shots and hard shots upstairs, that takes it out of you. It's harder to put your foot to the pedal in the second half of the fight. Crolla cannot afford to be taking as many shots. He's just got to be a little cuter and a little smarter. David Coldwell \nHe's got to make Linares uncomfortable, make him miss, make him feel his age. The last fight was a hard fight, but both picked up some hard shots, both found it gruelling. Crolla cannot afford to be taking as many shots. He's just got to be a little cuter and a little smarter. Jim McDonnell Jim McDonnell admits that Crolla is facing a high class opponent \nCrolla knows and isn't wondering what's in front of him. Yes, he was beaten but it was a close fight and at no stage did Linares really dominate. People forget that Crolla is also a quality, quality fighter. He has a great jab and if he sticks behind that and takes it from there, controlling the pace, it could be different. orge Linares has promised to take KO chance and beat Anthony Crolla again \nBut it's a Catch 22 though, because Ant is likely to go in with the challenger's mentality and force things. We saw how well Linares caught Kevin Mitchell, even when he was boxing at range. Sometimes you can have as many plans as you want but you just come up against a champion that is a little bit special. \nWatch Jorge Linares vs Anthony Crolla II and a packed undercard, live from the Manchester Arena, from 7pm, Saturday, Sky Sports 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T20:16:57.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
