Arrow kicked off the DC TV world, and acted as a launch pad for both The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow . Meanwhile, Supergirl initially started off on CBS, before premiering its second season on The CW. Thanks to all four shows being on one network, The CW was able to unite its legion of superheroes for a massive crossover at the end of last year, loosely inspired by the DC Comics limited event series Invasion!\nHowever, in addition to the four-show event, The CW also revealed plans last summer for a musical crossover between Supergirl and The Flash . More recently, the dates of the crossover – March 20 and 21 – were announced , while the villain was confirmed as Batman: The Brave and the Bold’s Music Meister . Now, a new report reveals who will be portraying the musical villain in the two-part crossover event.\nTVLine is reporting Darren Criss has been cast as Music Meister to guest star in The Flash and Supergirl’s musical crossover. Criss is a fellow alum of Glee , on which he appeared with The Flash star Grant Gustin (Barry Allen) and Supergirl’s Melissa Benoist (Kara Danvers). Executive producer of both series Andrew Kreisberg said of the casting:\n“With our Flash and our Supergirl being Glee alums, how could we not have them go up against another Glee favorite like Darren Criss? We have been blown away by his talent over the years and we can’t wait to see what he brings to the Music Meister.”\nCriss’s musical abilities were first recognized among fans of Harry Potter thanks to his starring role as the Boy Who Lived in the fan production, A Very Potter Musical ; he then reprised the role in both A Very Potter Sequel and A Very Potter Senior Year . His first television roles were on Little White Lie and Eastwick before later joining Glee and has additionally appeared on American Horror Story . Now, Criss will join the Arrowverse as Music Meister, a villain who is able to manipulate those around him through singing.\nIn addition to Criss, Benoist, and Gustin, The Flash and Supergirl crossover will se a number of Arrowverse stars flex their musical abilities, including Jesse L. Martin (Joe West), Jeremy Jordan (Winn Schott), Carlos Valdes (Cisco Ramon), Victor Garber (Professor Martin Stein), and John Barrowman (Malcolm Merlyn). Between Criss’s connection to Benoist and Gustin through Glee and the fact that Music Meister’s episode of Batman: The Brave and the Bold is one of the most well-received musical episodes on television , fans are sure to be excited by this casting.\nThat said, many fans were hoping The CW would cast Neil Patrick Harris as Music Meister , since the actor voiced the character on Batman: The Brave and the Bold . Harris recently responded to the question of whether he would appear on The CW, saying he hadn’t been contacted about the role. Certainly, fans would have liked to see him portray Music Meister in live-action. But, Criss undoubtedly has the talent and experience to carry the role – and Glee fans will likely be excited to see another alum join The CW’s DC universe.\nNext: Supergirl/The Flash Musical Crossover Details Revealed Supergirl season 2 returns with ‘Supergirl Lives’ Monday January 23rd at 8pm on The CW. The Flash returns with ‘Borrowing Problems from the Future’ on Tuesday, January 24th at 8pm on The CW.\nSource: TVLine", "external_links": ["http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Darren-Criss-Music-Meister.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Darren-Criss-Music-Meister.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Darren-Criss-Music-Meister.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1417&h=708&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Darren-Criss-Music-Meister.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Darren-Criss-Music-Meister.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Darren-Criss-Music-Meister.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop", "http://tvline.com/2017/01/23/darren-criss-the-flash-supergirl-music-meister-musical-episode/", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Darren-Criss-Music-Meister.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Darren-Criss-Music-Meister.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-23T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:06:42.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
