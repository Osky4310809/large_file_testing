Jay talked about Blue back in 2013 in a Samsung commercial, saying, “It’s something that we both created, you know? We still marvel at her.” Aww.\nBey said in 2013 during an interview with Oprah Winfrey that starting a family has been her greatest accomplishment . “It’s so much joy and I have my best friend,” Beyonce said. “She is hilarious and she is fire. I didn’t expect her to be fire but lord I’m a have me a time. She’s beautiful.”\nWe’re so happy for the family that they are expecting two more adorable additions! If you haven’t heard, Bey is pregnant with twins ! She recently shared on Instagram the following:\nWe would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. – The Carters We would like to share our love and happiness.
