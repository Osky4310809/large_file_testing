Sad trolls who could only wish to root for a team as great as the Pats said the game was over at the 28-3 deficit. \nFortunately the GOAT shut everyone up and delivered the mpst impressive Super Bowl win in history. davidceltic says: Feb 5, 2017 10:57 PM \nIn the future, a best-selling movie will FOREVER PRESERVE the disgraceful actions of the current NFL office and forever preserve the excellence of this Great Football Team. \nSince the end of the first half of the game in question: Brady 81 Touchdowns, 15 Interceptions; two AFC Championship WINS; 2 Super Bowl WINS; and helped his team win enough games to play in the 2016 AFC Championship game. \nNew England Patriots and Tom Brady: \nPRIOR to DEFLATEGATE: 5 AFC Championships WINS and 3 Super Bowl WINS. \nAFTER DEFLATEGATE (3 seasons): 2 AFC Championships WINS and 2 Super Bowl WINS. \nDEFLATEGATE FACTS: During 19 January, 2015 (day after AFC Championship Game), an official letter sent to Mr. Kraft from the senior vice president of NFL operations (David Gardi) informed the Patriots that an investigation will be conducted. \n1. FACT: On page two, the letter states the following: ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúeach of the Colts‚Äô game balls that was inspected met the requirements set forth.‚Äù \nThat statement turns out to be totally not true. Page 8, of the Wells report confirms that 3 of the 4 Colts‚Äô footballs were in fact deflated. Who from the NFL office directed to stop testing the Colts‚Äô remaining 8 footballs??? \n2. FACT: The NFL has finally admitted that they DID NOT know anything about the Ideal Gas Law (IGL). That admission is incredible! \n3. FACT: Brady was found guilty by the NFL office based on ‚ÄúASSUMPTIONS AND DATA THAT IS UNCERTAIN‚Äù (quote Wells Report). \n4. What would you do if someone in your family was accused and deemed guilty based on ‚ÄúASSUMPTIONS AND DATA THAT IS UNCERTAIN‚Äù (quote Wells Report)? Could you accept that??? \n5. Why wouldn‚Äôt Brady turn his cell phone in? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Would you provide your cell phone to folks that you know are not truthful (19 Jan. letter, etc.)??? \n6. FACT: NFL announces creation of PSI rules hours before leaking story that Brady ‚Äúdestroys‚Äù phone. Thus, the public quickly forgets the NFL admits they had no PSI rules or knowledge of the Ideal Gas Law. \n7. This is AMERICA and King Roger and Troy Vincent are NOT bigger than our great Country! \nIn the future, a best-selling movie will FOREVER PRESERVE the disgraceful actions of the current NFL office and forever preserve the excellence of this Great Football Team. weepingjebus says: Feb 5, 2017 10:58 PM \nThis should be the part where they take Goodell out to the marsh. ‚ÄúLeave the gun. Take the Lombardi.‚Äù Feb 5, 2017 11:00 PM \nBellichek is a badass. Gotta respect it norseyapper says: Feb 5, 2017 11:00 PM \nUnbelievable comeback. It is hard to imagine any other QB having the talent and automatic respect of his team to turn that thing around. Congrats to the Pats and their fans! 6ball says: Feb 5, 2017 11:01 PM \n. Football is a funny game and the Patriots seem to attract the oddest Super Bowl plays. They‚Äôve had the helmet catch, the Manningham heave, the Baldwin ricochet and this year‚Äôs Edelman shoe top grab. Nothing is ever normal with these guys . realtruthteller100 says: Feb 5, 2017 11:02 PM \ntotaly classless by the patriots so-called ‚Äúfans‚Äù to boo the commish like. just completely disrespectfull of the shield. just for that he should make there team move to los angeles. cant have that. not in this league. hurley711 says: Feb 5, 2017 11:04 PM \nHonestly greatest Super Bowl I‚Äôve ever watched and I had no dog in the fight. Congrats to the unquestionable greatness of B+B. \nATL wow. I mean just wow. Matty Ice? Why. Up 25. No team had ever come back from 10 down. The defense collapsed. And my Lord you‚Äôre up 8 with 3 mins left and in FG range and you promptly lose 22 yards instead of running the ball 3 times and getting the clock under 3 mins and go up 2 scores. What were they thinking??? NE would have had to use all heir timeouts and been down 2 scores with less than 3 mins. Unbelievable. trainwrecksryan says: Feb 5, 2017 11:05 PM \n‚ÄúToo bad the patriots fans‚Äô have zero class.‚Äù \nYou wrote this: \nFeb 5, 2017 10:40 PM Enjoy the SB win, Mom Brady. It‚Äôs the last one you‚Äôll see. \nTell us again about zero class. Feb 5, 2017 11:05 PM \nFunny, not one chirp from Cheetah Nation the first 3 quarters. Why were you hiding? youbettercallsaul says: Feb 5, 2017 11:05 PM \nGoodell looked as awkward as Rozelle did while handing the Lombardi to Al Davis. Feb 5, 2017 11:07 PM \nIt appears that reports at half time of the Patriots demise were a little premature! Feb 5, 2017 11:07 PM \nPutin is now a two time superbowl champion. grogansheroes says: Feb 5, 2017 11:07 PM \nI remember when one P Manning played the Seahawks in the Super Bowl. Got down, and folded like a cheap tent. Brady and the Pats fight for everything. Pats fan or not, you have to respect that. BED MAN OKC says: Feb 5, 2017 11:07 PM \nI wanna vomit in my mouth when I say this but Brady is one of the greatest QB of all time. While I don‚Äôt consider Trent Dilfer a better QB than Dan Marino because 1 has a SB win and the other doesnt- i do think the fact Tom has FIVE SB WINS and was within 1 play of winning 6 and 7. That coach is great and Tom is great. People that fail to see Brady and his greatness also claim things like‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ \n‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Andy Reid sucks even though at one point his team went to 4 straight NFC championship games and 1 Super Bowl loss. \nJim Kelly sucks because he lost 4 super bowls.
