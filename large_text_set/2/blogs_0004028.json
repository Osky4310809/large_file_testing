In this interview, Dr. Alexander Wunsch, one of the leading experts in photobiology, explains the historical significance of photobiology. \nI recently interviewed him about the dangers of light emitting diode (LED) lighting. That interview has nearly three-quarter of a million views at this point. If you haven’t seen it already, please take a look, as that interview went into some very practical, real world aspects of photobiology. \nHere, we focus on the historical component to help you get a better appreciation of its potential. Historical Use of Light Therapy \nLight has been used therapeutically for thousands of years. Humans have not only evolved to adapt to sunlight, but also to the influence of fire — near-infrared and mid-infrared radiation that is very low in in the blue range wavelengths — which is also emitted by incandescent light sources. \nIn ancient Egypt, we know that sunlight was used for hygienic purposes, and once humans began manufacturing glass, it also became possible to produce colored light using the colored glass as filter technology. \nAn important point that needs to be made is that the human retina is not designed to be exposed to blue light at night. We were ever only exposed to fire light at night. This is why it’s so crucial to block blue light, particularly at night, but also during the daytime when the light is from artificial sources. \nIncandescents and halogen lights are acceptable, as they contain the near-infrared wavelengths, while LEDs are best avoided, since they’re virtually devoid of these healing near-infrared wavelengths, emitting primarily blue light. \nAround the turn of the 18th century, light began to be used therapeutically to treat illness. \n“I call the time before the 18th century the “mystical phase” of light use, because humans already had clear indications that light does them good, but they didn’t explore it in a scientific manner,” Wunsch says . \n“In the 18th century — we also call it “the age of enlightenment” — people became much more interested in the reasons why the occurrences happen around them.” The First Phototherapeutic Device \nAndreas Gärtner, known as the “Saxonian Archimedes,” built the first phototherapeutical device. It was a foldable hollow mirror made from wood and plaster, covered with gold leaf. \nUsing this, he could concentrate sunlight onto aching joints of patients. People suffering from arthritis, rheumatism and gout found pain relief from this phototherapeutical unit. \nToday, we can explain how this device worked without causing a phototoxic reaction or burns. The gold leaf actually absorbs all of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight, emitting luminous heat rays in the near-infrared and red wavelengths, which is beneficial because it can penetrate deeply into the tissue. \n“It’s interesting that UV behaves quite peculiar in combination with certain metals. For example, silver only reflects about 4 percent of the incident UV radiation. Gold almost absorbs all the parts. The best reflector for UV is aluminum. \nWhen we talk about phototherapy, besides the heliotherapeutic application, we always have to look at the light source, and we have to look at the beam shaping media, such as the reflector or lenses, because they all contribute to the final blend of wavelengths, which then come into action in the phototherapeutical intervention,” Wunsch explains. The Science of Light in the 19th Century \nIn the late 19th century, we started gaining a great deal of knowledge about how light acts on the human body. It started with the experiments of A. Downes and T.P. Blunt, who discovered that UV radiation kills bacteria . Researchers were also interested in other parts in the optical spectrum. \nGeneral Augustus Pleasanton published “ Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight ” in 1876 in which he described experiments performed between 1861 and 1876. \nHe grew grapes for wine, using not only transparent colorless glass, but also blue window glass. With the latter, he got a significant increase in plant growth. Later, he performed similar experiments on humans. \n“People in the late 19th century, especially in the United States, would walk around with blue glasses. In a way, they did exactly the opposite of what we do today to protect our eyesight. \nThey even enhanced the blue part of the spectrum because they used it as a kind of booster, a kind of doping, and didn’t care about the long-term effects, which are pretty negative …” \nWearing blue-colored glasses increases the blue exposure and limits the red and infrared. \nThe problem with that is that while short-term use of blue-enriched light has an activating effect, you can quickly develop a tolerance and, long-term, the stimulating effect is harmful to your biology. Hence wearing blue-tinted glasses on a daily basis is not a good idea. \n“You can use them for a few minutes. This can be a good idea. From today’s scientific viewpoint, we need at least one hour of unfiltered daylight [each day] during adolescence in order to prevent myopia. But it’s not pure blue, and not pure blocking. Somewhere in between is the golden pathway to health.” Reinventing the Wheel \nThe same year Pleasanton published his book on blue light experiments, Dr. Seth Pancoast published “ Blue and Red Light: Light and Its Rays as Medicine ,” covering both blue and red light experiments. \nPancoast understood the antagonistic effect of red and blue light, using red light to stimulate sympathetic activity and blue light to stimulate parasympathetic activity. \nA year later, in 1878, a year before Edison invented the incandescent lamp, Dr. Edwin Dwight Babbitt published “ Principles of Light and Color .” He used the full set of rainbow colors discovered by Newton, and later on used the color set of Goethe.
