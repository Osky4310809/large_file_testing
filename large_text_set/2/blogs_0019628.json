I don’t work that way. Once we have confirmed 100 per cent the venue and the arena and who the opponent is we’ll make an announcement. But until then I think it’s detrimental to all negotiations taking place and it’s not fair to the candidates we are looking to fight.” \nThe apparent stand-off between Arum and Koncz over Pacquiao’s immediate boxing future has placed in jeopardy Horn’s much publicised fight with the Filipino champion. \nThe Horn-Pacquiao showdown was originally scheduled for Suncorp Stadium on April 23, but Koncz has openly discussed moving the fight to the UAE.

Because in my previous fights many of them are saying they will stop me, they will knock me out and it’s not happening.” \nHe added: “I’m hoping that the fight will be in Australia, I’d love to do that. I’ve been to Australia once or twice but for gambling.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
