While the action was planned under Barack Obama, activists fear they are targeting more immigrants than planned.

The order also strips federal money from sanctuary cities which offer protection to undocumented workers. \n\"This operation was in the planning stages before the current administration issued its executive order,\" David Marin, an ICE office director in Los Angeles, told CNN. \"We do these operations two to three times a year.
