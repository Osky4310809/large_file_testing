I would support her because we need a change in New York City,” said Gregory Floyd, president of Teamsters Local 237.\nFloyd, who represents school safety officers and Housing Authority workers, has clashed repeatedly with City Hall over policy.\n“Hillary would be a better mayor than de Blasio. Every week we hear about investigations about fund-raising and city property being given away to real estate developers,” he said.\nClinton captured 79 percent of the vote in the five boroughs during her failed November presidential run.\nThe Rev. Patrick Young, pastor of First Baptist Church in East Elmhurst, Queens, said Clinton could make history by shattering the mayoral glass ceiling in Gotham.\n“Hillary would have been the first female president. She would be the first woman mayor in the history of New York City,” he said.\n“She would be better at working with people and engaging people. She would be a breath of fresh air. We have a cloud over our leadership right now.”\nThe Rev. Johnny Green, pastor of Harlem’s Mount Neboh Baptist Church, said Clinton would have his vote.\n“Hillary over de Blasio. Anybody against de Blasio. De Blasio is a repeat offender when it comes to stupidity,” Green said.\nOne de Blasio critic claimed de Blasio would be toast if Clinton runs.\n“I’m not sure she would have an opponent.

I’m fine with a pantsuit city,” ­ Ladychampagneb posted on Instagram .\nClinton allies are pushing talk of her possibly running for mayor to “torture” de Blasio for waiting so long to back Clinton in the presidential race, according to one Democratic Party official.\n“Trust me. People don’t forget,” said a Clinton Democratic National Committee delegate from New York.\nA source said Clinton did not discourage her backers from discussing a City Hall bid.\n“She wants to remain relevant,” the source said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T05:52:09.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
