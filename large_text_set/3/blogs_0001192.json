Well, obviously not Groot, as he's now a fraction of his original size and infinitely more adorable. \nWhile not nearly as drastic, Peter Quill switched up his style a bit as well. He's still got his long leather jacket, but the T-shirt he's wearing in the trailer is one that fans didn't see in the first movie. \nSince the trailer debuted, everyone's been trying to figure out what the shirt says, or if it's a logo of some kind. Unfortunately, the language on the shirt is one that none of us will be able to read any time soon. \nChris Pratt was asked if he could translate the words on the shirt, and he revealed that it's got roots in a much deeper part of the galaxy. \"Somebody can, because it’s a real language apparently. They’ve created a real alphabet, but it’s from - I think, I might be making this up – I think it’s from a candy wrapper from the first movie. This is like a space brand of some kind so it’s like on my shirt the way anyone would be wearing an ironic Reese’s Pieces shirt or something like that.\" If that's true, that t-shirt Easter Egg is a deep cut to the first film. Now, it's likely every big Guardians fan will rush home, pop in the Blu-Ray, and try to find the mysterious candy wrapper they didn't notice the first time around. \nMORE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2: First Good Look At Taserface / James Gunn On Guardians Working With Avengers / Is Yondu A Member Of The Guardians Now? / James Gunn Reveals How Many Were Up For The Ayesha Role / Did Ego The Living Planet Show Up In Super Bowl Spot? / New Dancing Guardians / Concept Art Shows Off Star-Lord's Space Pirate Style / Guardians Star Comments On Drax's New, Surprising Friendship / New Photos Released / James Gunn Releases Another Piece Of Guardians VOL. 2 Score / Make Your Own Groot Cake / Mantis Seemingly Confirmed For Avengers: Infinity War / Vin Diesel Says A Groot Solo Film Is Inevitable / First Look At Ego / Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 LEGO Sets Revealed / Every Marvel Studios Hero Confirmed For 2017 Movies \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is written and directed by James Gunn (Slither).
