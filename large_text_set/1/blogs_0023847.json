Closing doors further divides US. Let’s all find ways to connect people, not separate them.”\nSince President Donald Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim countries, dozens of immigrants have been removed from flights en route to the U.S., and travelers have been detained upon arrival, as well.\nThe 90-day ban applied to travelers from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya and includes American residents holding green cards.\nA federal judge in Brooklyn issued an emergency stay Saturday evening after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a petition on behalf of 2 Iraqi men detained at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T07:36:35.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
