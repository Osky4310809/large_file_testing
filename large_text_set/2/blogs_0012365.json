The initiative will be extended to other areas in phases after this, depending on the economic situation,” said Adnan. \nThe programmes had received encouraging response from the public, he added, following the Jom Isi Minyak programme held at the Precinct 9 Petronas station yesterday. The programme which started at 6pm yesterday saw 200 motorcycles filled with petrol, with motorcyclists reported to be waiting at the station from 5pm for free fuel.
