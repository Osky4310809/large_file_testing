Available for both iOS and Android devices, Laugh.ly is the first to offer an extensive library of comedians’ stand-up sets, with content from top names in the biz, including Kevin Hart, Amy Schumer, Louis C.K., Hannibal Buress, George Carlin, Chris Rock and others. \nIn addition to lead investors New York Angels, the round included participation from Shark Tank’s Barbara Corcoran, the Wharton Alumni Angel Network, Social+Capital, Backstage Capital, Treehouse Capital, Accelerator Ventures and Atlas Holdings. \nLaugh.ly had previously raised funds through a SAFE note (the less complicated replacement for a convertible note.) \nThe startup first debuted at TechCrunch Disrupt New York 2016 , where it was plucked out of the Startup Alley as one of the Startup Battlefield Wild Card winners, and earned the chance to pitch on stage to judges and VCs. Startup Battlefield Wild Card: Laugh.ly Brings Customized Comedy to Devices at #TCDisrupt https://t.co/927jYM6TzU \n— TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) May 9, 2016 \nThe startup has an interesting history. The app was created by Dave Scott, a serial entrepreneur with a background in e-commerce and marketing automation. But Scott explained that he found himself drawn to comedy, and later became a stand-up himself, doing open mic nights and attending San Francisco Comedy College. This gave him first-hand insight into the comedy business and its many challenges. \nWith the debut of Laugh.ly, the goal has been to give comedians a new stream of income in an era where fewer people are buying comedian’s CDs and DVDs, and instead are watching sets online through streaming services like Netflix and HBO Now. But while those stand-up videos are now easier to find online, the CD equivalent is not. That’s where Laugh.ly comes in. \nDescribed as something of a Pandora for comedy, the app can create personalized “radio” stations of comedy, in addition to offering on-demand listening. \nLaugh.ly today has grown to include albums from 400 comedians at launch to now over 650 comedians, and has seen the addition of tens of thousands of tracks. \nSince August 2016, the app has been used by over 200,000 users – growth which Scott tells us has been largely organic through word-of-mouth referrals. Users are listening for over 60 minutes per session, on average, the company also says. img_2198", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T18:38:27.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
