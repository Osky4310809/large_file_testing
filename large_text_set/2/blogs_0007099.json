Same for Goncalo [Guedes], who is cup-tied. They will be different matches because Bordeaux and Barcelona are different teams. \n\"For the moment, we are focused on Friday's game and are looking at ways of stopping [Francois] Kamano, Malcom, [Gaetan] Laborde, [Diego] Rolan, [Jeremy] Menez, [Younousse] Sankhare. \n\"After that, we will think about [Lionel] Messi, Neymar, [Gerard] Pique and [Jordi] Alba.\" \nObviously nothing Bordeaux can throw at PSG will be as potent as the likes of Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez. However, with Barcelona looking like more of a \"normal\" team this season, leading into the game in a position where they need to win bodes better than the past few years. \nUnder Laurent Blanc, the French giants would usually resume their Champions League campaign with a healthy lead at the top of Ligue 1, which would allow them to focus their efforts solely on Europe. \nUnable to do that this time around, the lack of let-up in the intensity of the fixture list could actually aid PSG's chances of producing the sort of performance they need against Barcelona next week. \nUnai Emery can't afford to be thinking about Barcelona with a difficult Bordeaux side to face on Friday. \nWhat they must do now, though, is mentally block out the impending visit of the Spanish giants and focus on Bordeaux as if it is the only match they have coming up. They failed to do so against Lille OSC in midweek and almost paid the price, so there are no excuses here. \nThere is an almost four-day gap before the Barcelona showdown, meaning the players should not be mentally trying to keep themselves as fresh as possible during the game at Matmut Atlantique. They can fully apply themselves in Bordeaux before doing the same against the Catalans. \nMidfielder Marco Verratti, goalkeeper Kevin Trapp and right-back Thomas Meunier are all back from injury, boosting Emery's options. Now the Spaniard is only missing playmaker Javier Pastore, who he also might be able to involve against Barca -- even if his current fitness is questionable at best. \nNot only will a win over Bordeaux set PSG up nicely for next week's continental exertions, it will also -- temporarily at least -- pull them level with AS Monaco at the Ligue 1 summit. \nInstead of bemoaning the busy schedule and its fatiguing impact on the players, Emery and his men should embrace the intensity of the calendar and use it to build up as much momentum as possible to help them past Barca. \nIt might be what they have missing these past few years when faced with the La Liga giants these past few years. \nJonathan Johnson covers PSG and the French national team for ESPN FC.
