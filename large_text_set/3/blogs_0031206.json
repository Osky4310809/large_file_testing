She was suspended for a day. #abc11 pic.twitter.com/L1niHRZt2u\nâ€” Morgan Norwood (@MorganABC11) March 28, 2017\n\"Hoke County Schools said Caitlin posed a threat to other students when she made a shooting motion, thus violating policy 4331.\"\nThe school district clowns offered a statement about the suspension: \"Hoke County Schools will not tolerate assaults, threats or harassment from any student. Any student engaging in such behavior will be removed from the classroom or school environment for as long as is necessary to provide a safe and orderly environment for learning,\" the school system says.\nThis ABC11 video shows Caitlin describing her \"crime.\"\nReally?\nABC11 reports, \"Miller says Caitlin was alienated by her friends and teachers as a result of the suspension. She hopes that the school will issue some sort of apology to her daughter.\"\nThis is terrible. What sort of idiots are teaching America's children? A teacher had to decide that Caitlin's pretend behavior was dangerous and a threat to those in the school and then school administrators had to agree to suspend her. The anti-gun left has schools so spooked and scared they are punishing 5-year-old girls for playing.\nShame on them.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/30/5-year-old-suspended-from-school-for-pretending-a-stick-was-a-gun/", "external_links": ["https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2017/03/CaitlinStickShooter2.jpg", "https://twitter.com/MorganABC11/status/846751834123501569", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/abc11?src=hash", "https://t.co/L1niHRZt2u", "http://abc11.com/education/girl-5-suspended-for-playing-with-stick-gun/1823430/"], "published": "2017-03-30T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T12:54:17.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
