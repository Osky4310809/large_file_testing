But what are their secrets to making that happen? A combination of proper nutrition, little stress, a lot of water, and the right products, as it turns out. \nRead on for the skincare secrets of some of the top yogis in the business. 1. Jules Hunt Photo credit: @omandthecity \n\"My secret is absolutely coconut oil. I wash my face with Dr. Bronner's Castile Soap, and I use extra virgin, organic, unrefined coconut oil from Trader Joe's as my daily moisturizer. I've stuck with this for years, and it works for me. It cured my cystic acne and completely changed my skin. I also only use 100% natural makeup from the cosmetics brand 100% Pure . I've been using them for a year now, and have yet to find a beauty brand I love more. Basically, I try to live by the rule: if you wouldn't eat it, then don't put it on your skin.\" - Jules Hunt , yogi and founder of the blog Om & The City . 2. Heather Lilleston Photo credit: @heatherlilleston \n\"Worry less. Have more fun and laugh a lot. Play a lot. Be kind, honest, and generous—it will show in your skin. Other than that, drink water. I love Linne Purify face wash/mask—a new incredible face wash that feels like a light scrub and can also be used as a mask. It's perfect for traveling and does wonders for the skin as a mask. I also recommend headstands—they're a great way to flush the body and rejuvenate the skin. \nI go for an apple cider vinegar shot every morning and pour it into a bath every now and then. It's such a good way to detox the skin and rebalance your body's pH levels. Don't forget to get enough sleep and sweat daily!\" - Heather Lilleston , Yoga For Bad People co-founder. 3. Jordan Younger Photo credit: @thebalancedblonde \n\"I have discovered something that has changed my skin's life lately, and that is argan oil . Crazy simple, but so good. It doesn't clog pores so I mix a little bit of it with my Juice Beauty foundation every morning and also use it along with my nighttime moisturizer (or sometimes I sub out my moisturizer and just use the argan oil). I also think that washing my face directly after a sweaty workout helps a lot, and of course the more yoga I do and the better that I eat, the more I find that my skin glows. A high fat diet and the keto powder that I use every day also help a lot with skin... as well as eating foods rich in B12.\" - Jordan Younger , L.A.-based yoga teacher and author of Breaking Vegan . Hilaria Baldwin Photo credit: @hilariabaldwin \n\"I believe that beauty and skin health begin from the inside out—good nutrition, hydration, sleep, and namaste lifestyle are key to a clear and glowing complexion. This doesn't mean you have to be perfect, but strive on the average day to eat, drink, and live as healthfully as possible.\" -Hilaria Baldwin, New York-based yogi and author of The Living Clearly Method: 5 Principles For A Fit, Healthy Mind & Joyful Life . Sasha Nelson Photo credit: @sashayogawellness \n\"Meditation and yoga have both been invaluable practices for my skin, my gut, and the quality of my life in general. The skin on my face always feels and looks the most fresh when I drink a lot of water, eat a lot of greens, eat mostly unprocessed foods, and avoid processed sugar (a big-time inflammatory culprit). I think it is true for most of us that the cleaner our diet, the more balanced our skin looks and feels. \nDry-brushing before a shower has been great for smoothing out my skin, and for after-shower I am committed to 100% organic products. I have recently been experimenting with straight up oils— Dr. Bronner's virgin coconut oil and Acure Organic's argan oil are my favorites for face and hair, and Kimberly Parry Organic's sweet orange and Aura Cacia's sesame oil is my favorite for body. \nMy dear friend Chris of Joy Connector creates blends of body oils and delicious scrubs that feel and smell so divine I smile every time I use them. I use Juice Beauty 's mascara and tinted moisturizer, whose earth-conscious initiatives are just as wonderful as their clean products. For sunscreen I use Goddess Garden Organics —I firmly believe a little beach time for sun and salt does wonders for the skin and within.\" - Sasha Nelson , New York-based yogi. Koya Webb Photo credit: @koyawebb \"Clear skin is important to me so I make sure I drink a gallon of water infused with lemon daily and I follow a plant based vegan diet. You can see the 28-day nutrtion plan I follow here . Clear skin starts from what you put inside your body!\" - Koya Webb , health coach and yogi. Tara Stiles Photo credit: @tarastiles \n\"I lather coconut oil or shea butter on my face and whole body before bed and in the am post shower. Taking care of my skin and whole self starts from the inside. Drinking lots of water consistently, avoiding processed foods, loading up on fresh fruits and veggies, and practicing dropping tension and stress through easy-going yoga and meditation help me feel my best.\" - Tara Stiles , Strala yoga founder.
