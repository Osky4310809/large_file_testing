Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com \nA family tragedy unfolded Thursday in a series of dramas in Glen Carbon and Highland: a deadly house fire, an infant saved from a sinking SUV, a body recovered in a lake. \nA woman's body was pulled from the lake. The body was later identified as Cristy L. Campbell, 32, of Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon. She was the mother of the infant. \nA body found in the Glen Carbon house was a man, a source said. \nThe baby boy was taken to a St. Louis hospital for treatment after being pulled from the SUV in Silver Lake around 6 a.m. He was expected to make a full recovery and to be released Friday, Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. \n\"Fortunately there is something good that can come of this,\" Lakin said of the child's survival. \nAuthorities were notified about 5:15 a.m. that a house on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon was burning. Six children who were in the house when the fire began escaped. Some of those children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart to call 911, said Glen Carbon Police Lt. Wayne White. \nThe caller said there was a possible victim inside, White said, but the house was fully involved and firefighters could not safely enter until they had put the fire out. The body was removed midafternoon Thursday. An autopsy will be done. \nA surveillance video obtained from a neighbor shows an SUV's headlights switching on in the driveway of the house about 4:50 a.m. Several minutes later, the SUV backs out of the driveway. About 3 minutes later, a reflection from the flames of the burning house can be seen on the side of a nearby house. Four children run across the street, heading in the direction of Wal-Mart. The smallest child is carrying a blanket. \nAround 5:30 a.m. about 16 miles east of the Glen Carbon house, a 911 caller notified the Madison County Sheriff's Office that a vehicle had driven into Silver Lake, off Route 143. Highland EMS made it to the lake first and paramedic Todd Zobrist rushed into the cold water and searched the vehicle. \nLakin lauded Zobrist as a \"hero,\" saying he swam out 50 to 75 feet into the lake, did a sweep of the car and found the three-month-old baby floating inside the vehicle with about six or eight inches of air space. \nThe baby was lifeless when Zobrist pulled him from the SUV and Zobrist began CPR on the roof of the vehicle, which was partly submerged, Lakin said. The infant was rushed to a St. Louis hospital. \nAt the same time, authorities launched a boat to search for the driver. They issued a plea for the public's help in finding Cristy Lynn Campbell, a \"person of interest.\" +10 \nPolice have released his photo of Cristy L. Campbell, 32, who is a person of interest in the house fire that killed one person in Glen Carbon, Ill., Thursday morning. Glen Carbon police \nCristy Campbell's body was found around 11:15 a.m. about 400 feet from where the vehicle went into the water, Lakin said. It was pulled from the lake around 1:15 p.m. \nA gun was found inside the SUV, a source said. \nCristy Campbell was divorced in Madison County in 2012 from Justin Campbell, according to court records. She identifies Justin Campbell on Facebook as being the father of her children. The divorce was granted by default when he failed to appear in court. Cristy Campbell was awarded custody of the children. \nCristy Campbell has published photos of herself with seven children, including a baby boy, Julian, born in December. The four boys and two girls range in age from 4 to 14. \nA neighbor, Sherry Ricker, said she believed that Justin Campbell was living at the house, a split level on a street of well kept ranch and two-story houses. She said the family was always busy because the kids were involved in a variety of activities, and that the house was filled with trophies. \nShe said she saw Cristy Campbell and held the baby three days ago. \"She was happier than I had seen her in a long time,\" Ricker said. \nAll seven children, \"to include the infant child rescued from the submerged vehicle,\" are accounted for and safe, the Madison County Sheriff's Office said in a press release. They are with family members, Lakin said. \nCourt records point to a tumultuous relationship between Cristy and Justin Campbell. \nIn 2005, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse. Prosecutors said he caused bodily harm to Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy L. Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was 16 weeks pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to a year of probation and fined $500. \nThe couple, who by this time had three children, was married on Nov. 3, 2006, at the Madison County Court House. \nJustin Campbell's probation was revoked when he failed to pay on time and appear in court, and he was arrested in October 2007. The case was closed again in December 2007. \nIn 2010, Cristy Campbell sued her husband for divorce, but withdrew the suit. \nOn April 24, 2012, she alleged abuse again. \n\"He has choked me, he has pushed me several times, he has slapped me in my head, he has pushed me into bricks,” she wrote. \nA judge granted an emergency order of protection on April 25, 2012, and Cristy Campbell sued again for divorce. \nOn May 10, 2012, the couple appeared in court together and Cristy Campbell asked for the protection order to be dismissed; it was. \nThe divorce was finalized on July 27, 2012. She was awarded custody, he was granted visitation rights. \nIn February 2014, Cristy Campbell requested supervised visitation, alleging that one of the children told her his father had pinched and punched him, and another child said he had been choked. The court ordered that Justin Campbell’s visitation take place at a court-approved neutral location. \nIn May 2014, Glen Carbon Police cited Cristy Campbell after she allegedly allowed a 5-year-old child to leave their home on Dogwood Lane and “wander around the streets of Glen Carbon unattended.” She attended parenting classes in exchange for prosecutors dropping the charge. \nAuthorities said at the news conference that they had answered about 50 calls at the house since 2010, including hangup 911 calls, barking dog calls and some domestic calls. \nThe house stood Thursday with melted siding and a charred roof line. A Spiderman bicycle was propped against a wall, near an angel statue. \nA manager at Bob Evans restaurant in Collinsville, where Justin Campbell was employed and worked on Wednesday, said the staff is distraught. Campbell was \"an outstanding guy,\" he said, who \"loved his kids.\" \nSilver Lake is about 16 miles east of the Glen Carbon home that burned. \nJeremy Kohler, Ashley Jost and Robert Cohen of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this article. \nHere's our earlier coverage: \nA deadly house fire early Thursday in Glen Carbon and an SUV carrying only an infant rolling into a lake in Highland are connected, authorities said. \nThe body of a man was found in the Glen Carbon house, and a woman's body was pulled from the lake, a source said Thursday afternoon. The woman was identified as Cristy L. Campbell, 32, of Glen Carbon, according to the Madison County Sheriff's Office. \nThe baby was taken to a St. Louis hospital for treatment after being pulled from the SUV in Silver Lake around 6 a.m. The baby was expected to make a full recovery and to be released Friday, Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. \nThe body was pulled from the lake around 1:15 p.m. It was found in a brushy area near the edge of the lake. \nA gun was found inside the SUV, a source said. An ID found inside a purse in the SUV belonged to a female who lived at the address where the fire occurred in Glen Carbon, the press release said. \nThe man's body found at the house has not yet been identified. \nLaw officers had launched a boat to search the lake and the coroner was called shortly after 11 a.m. \nPolice in Glen Carbon, where one person died in the house fire early Thursday, had asked for help in finding the owner of the home. Cristy Campbell was a \"person of interest,\" police said. By the time of the press conference Thursday afternoon, authorities said they were no longer looking for Cristy Campbell. \nSix children who were in the home when the fire began all escaped, authorities said. \nCristy Campbell has published photos of herself with seven children, including a baby boy, Julian, born in December. The four boys and two girls range in age from 4 to 14. \n\"We believe the infant in the lake at Highland could be the seventh in the family,\" said Glen Carbon Fire Chief Ralph Well. \nA paramedic went into the water to search the vehicle and found a baby floating in water with about 6-8 inches of air space inside the SUV. The baby was unresponsive when the paramedic pulled him out and the paramedic began CPR on the hood of the SUV, Lakin said. The baby was taken to a St. Louis hospital, said Fire Department Capt. Brad Menz. \nMenz said the SUV appeared to have rolled down a hillside into the lake around 6 a.m. near Illinois Route 143. No one else was in the vehicle, and it was not immediately clear how the car wound up in the water. \nAt least 20 police officers were seen at the house next to where the car went into the lake. It was unclear if there was a connection between the home and the SUV. Detectives at the scene did not answer questions. \nCampbell was divorced in Madison County in 2012 from Justin Campbell, whom she identifies on Facebook as being the father of her children, according to court records. The divorce was granted by default when Justin Campbell failed to appear in court. Cristy Campbell was awarded custody of the children. \nMonths prior to the divorce, Cristy Campbell sought and obtained an order of protection from the father, alleging abuse. The order was dismissed about two weeks later at the request of Cristy Campbell. \nIn a news conference earlier Thursday, Glen Carbon Police Lt. Wayne White said two of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart and called 911 after the fire broke out about 5:15 a.m. \nThe caller said there was a possible victim inside, Well said, but the house was fully involved and firefighters could not safely enter it until they had put the fire out. \nPolice informed firefighters that it was a crime scene and possibly related to the Highland incident, Well said. \nThe body inside the house was removed about 3:40 p.m. \nA surveillance video obtained from a neighbor shows the headlights turning on in an SUV parked in Campbell's driveway about 4:50 a.m. Thursday. Several minutes later, the SUV backs out of the driveway and two small children can be seen in the headlights. About 3 minutes later, a reflection from the flames of the burning house can be seen on the side of a nearby house. Four children run across the street, heading in the direction of Wal-Mart. The smallest child is carrying a blanket. \nAbout 5:01 a.m., a black sedan pulls into the frame and parks across the street from the house. Two men walk in the direction of the Wal-Mart. A few minutes later, the men return to the car, turn around in the cul de sac and sit there as a fire truck comes down the street. The car leaves when the fire truck passes it. \nSherry Ricker lives across the street from the Campbell residence. She said the family was always busy because the kids were involved in a variety of activities, and that the house was filled with trophies. \nShe said she saw Cristy Campbell and held the baby three days ago. \"She was happier than I had seen her in a long time,\" Ricker said. \nCourt records point to a tumultuous relationship between Cristy and Justin Campbell. \nIn 2005, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse.
