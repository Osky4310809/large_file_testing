The incidents allegedly took place in 2010 and 2012. \nKulik posted bond Wednesday afternoon, but the judge ordered him to wear a monitoring device and stay away from the victim, schools and any children younger than 16. \nThe Boston Fire Department says Kulik has been going through the retirement process for the past several months and has not been an active firefighter. \nA spokesman for the department says, “These disturbing, serious allegations warrant our full attention and the Boston Fire Department will monitor and take swift appropriate action if and when it’s necessary.” \nKulik is due back in court on April 24 for a pre-trial hearing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:31:26.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
