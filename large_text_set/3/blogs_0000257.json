But if we get stuck looking for, like, a boomerang in the, I don't know, Forest Temple, what are we supposed to do with Nintendo's new goddamn thing? Prop up a wobbly end table? Use it as a platter to serve our loved ones breakfast in bed? Play Just Dance ? All of these options are equally terrible. \nBut today, Nintendo gave us a little hope, announcing roughly one billion (okay, 17) indie games coming this year to the Switch. Watch the Nintendo Direct announcement here, but steel yourself: it is full of delightful surprises : \nGood god Nintendo â€” that's a lot of games. And while Stardew Valley , Yooka Laylee , and SteamWorld Dig 2 are the big stand-outs, I'm personally looking forward to Shakedown: Hawaii and Blaster Master Zero , because they feel like old school Nintendo games. \nJust the other day, Nintendo announced there wouldn't be a Virtual Console at launch, meaning there wouldn't be any classic Nintendo games (say, from the NES or SNES era) available to download. These indie games (Nintendo refers to them as \"Nindies\", but I will not do the same, for I am an adult) will help fill that gap... but only so much. It's like when you're really wanting some ice cream, but can only get a popsicle. To the casual observer, they're pretty much the same cold treat, but we know the difference. Nintendo, we still want a way to download the ice cream we crave! (It would also be cool if we could abandon the metaphor and the Nintendo Switch could also let us download ice cream.) \n\nFollow Mikey on Twitter @mikeymccollor .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T07:04:12.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
