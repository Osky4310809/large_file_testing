Only the Porsche 918 Spyder is quicker at 2.2 seconds, a time set by Car and Driver . \nTo get a better understanding of just how the Tesla is capable of such a feat, Engineering Explained is on hand to provide you with a better understanding. There’s plenty of math and principles that Jason Fenske will explain here, so pay attention. \nAdditionally, he’ll even answer the question of: will the Tesla Roadster be even quicker if it had the same electric powertrain as the Model S P100D. If you want to know the science behind the performance of the electrifying sedan, do watch the video.
