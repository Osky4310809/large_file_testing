Groups call Enterprise Bank minority lending commitment 'groundbreaking' By Lisa Brownlbrown@post-dispatch.com314-340-8127 \nFILE PHOTO: Elisabeth Risch, director of research and education at the Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing Opportunity Council, announces details of Midland States Bank's planned investment in St. Louis on Oct. 2, 2014. Other members of the St. Louis Equal Housing and Community Reinvestment Alliance stand in the background. \nCommunity groups describe as “groundbreaking” a new community benefits agreement with Enterprise Bank and Trust that commits to lending hundreds of millions of dollars in low-income areas. \n“This is a completely voluntary agreement, and Enterprise Bank approached us wanting to craft a community benefits agreement,” said Jackie Hutchinson, co-chair of the St. Louis Equal Housing and Community Reinvestment Alliance, in an announcement of the agreement Thursday. “It will change the landscape of our community if we all work together.” \nIt’s the largest community benefits agreement that SLEHCRA, a coalition of consumer advocacy and community groups, has been a party to, said Elisabeth Risch, who co-chairs the alliance with Hutchinson. \n“The volume of it is pretty significant,” Risch said. \nThe agreement commits Clayton-based Enterprise Bank to $30 million in annual home loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers for the next three years in both the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. It’s also the first time the Community Reinvestment Alliance has brokered a deal that covers the state’s two biggest metropolitan areas. \nEnterprise Bank has also agreed to lend $15 million annually to minority homebuyers in St. Louis and $9 million in Kansas City during the three-year agreement and $60 million a year to small businesses in low- and moderate-income areas of the two metro areas. \nIn addition, Enterprise says it will keep 10 percent of its assets as community development loans, which Risch said put the value of the total agreement at about $1.8 billion over three years. Enterprise has about $5 billion in assets now. \nEnterprise also plans to open two new service locations in low-income areas. Robyn Heidger, Enterprise Bank’s senior vice president of diversity and inclusion, said the bank was eyeing Old North St. Louis for one of them. \nShe also touted smaller programs in the agreement. A $500,000 microloan fund for small business lending in St. Louis minority neighborhoods is something the city’s economic development arm had been pushing. And Heidger said that $120,000 committed to bank-sponsored savings account matches could help low-income customers buy a new car to get to a new job. \n“As much as we all focus on homeownership … there’s other ways for us to increase wealth,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T07:15:02.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
