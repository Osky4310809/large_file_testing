But until Sunday night, Williams had never shared photos of the lad on social media, or given fans any major clues about his identity. \nThis all changed when the couple hit the town in Paris post-Valentine’s Day. Williams shared a photo of she and Jackson decked out in formal wear, captioning the pic “What a tasty dish .”\nWhat a tasty dish \nA post shared by Maisie Williams (@maisie_williams) on Feb 18, 2017 at 5:25pm PST \nJackson also shared photos of Williams enjoying the Louvre…\nRaindrop \nA post shared by OLLIE JACKSON (@olliejwckson) on Feb 17, 2017 at 3:25pm PST \nJust being well touristy n that \nA post shared by OLLIE JACKSON (@olliejwckson) on Feb 12, 2017 at 12:01pm PST \n…And joked about his first public appearance with the typically private actress, noting in his caption that he’d “made it” and was sleeping his way “to the top.”\nHappy to announce my first appearance on the red carpet with raindrop #imadeitmum #sleeptothetop \nA post shared by OLLIE JACKSON (@olliejwckson) on Feb 10, 2017 at 12:31pm PST \nHowever, this doesn’t mean that Jackson is angling for fame, of course. Williams also told InStyle way back when that her man was a normal, everyday dude that she met in school.\n“People feel it’s strange that someone who’s famous can go out with someone who’s normal,” she explained. “I don’t meet anyone else. Maybe I’m doing it wrong, but I don’t go to all these parties. I don’t meet the other young, male actors. I just like normal people, I guess.”\nAs fellow normal people, we are totally on board with celebrities dating our kind — but is it cool if we also really, really hope to see Williams and Jackson double-date with Sophie Turner and her decidedly un-normal boyfriend Joe Jonas? \nA girl [who has no name] can dream. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:27:48.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
