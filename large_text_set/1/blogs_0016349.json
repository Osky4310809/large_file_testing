A second report earlier this month from the new all-party parliamentary group on social integration also called for new immigrants to Britain to learn English in compulsory classes on arrival. \nAyres-Bennett said there was a general lack of awareness of the value of languages in the UK. While there has been a marked improvement in the take-up of so-called Stem subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), languages are still undervalued both in government and by the general public. \nShe said even a basic knowledge of some community languages could be beneficial to social cohesion and could be taught either formally or through joint community initiatives. \n“One of the areas we are looking at in my project is the question of which languages we should be teaching and learning in the UK, and that is why we are looking not just at the major languages traditionally taught in our schools and universities such as French and Spanish, but also the indigenous languages (Welsh, Irish, Scottish Gaelic) and the community languages.” \nThe study of modern foreign languages in schools and universities has fallen dramatically in recent years. “One of the reasons British monolinguals find foreign language learning difficult is because we don’t tend to have the same exposure to other languages outside the classroom, so that we generally hear the language we are learning relatively little compared with what happens elsewhere in Europe, where notably English is present on the TV, in pop songs and so on. \n“As a society, we undervalue multilingualism and the positive impact it has on individuals, their health and their wellbeing as well as on our economy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T16:48:29.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
