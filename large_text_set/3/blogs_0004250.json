Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAitor Karanka insists he has the same mentality as mentor Jose Mourinho as he attempts to drag Middlesbrough to Premier League safety. \nThe Spaniard cut his teeth as a coach under Mourinho at Real Madrid before stepping into the limelight on Teesside in November 2013. \nOn Sunday, the Manchester United boss added the EFL Cup to the Community Shield his new employers collected in August to counter the critics who were less than impressed by his start at Old Trafford. \nKaranka knows exactly what makes Mourinho tick and is adamant that he is driven by the same forces as he looks to keep Boro out of the relegation zone, a process which will continue at Stoke on Saturday. The pair were both at Madrid (Photo: Getty) \nHe said: \"I was with him for three years. We are different, but the mentality that we have about our job is the same. We think 24 hours per day, 100 per cent every day about our job. \n\"At the beginning he was criticised and, at the moment, he has two titles in his pocket.\" \nThe pair, who will go head-to-head at the Riverside Stadium on March 19, still speak on a regular basis, and Karanka admits that the advice he receives from one of the game's highest-profile managers is invaluable. \nHe said: \"Always, especially in this situation, when you have help from your friends, it's good.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T17:35:01.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
