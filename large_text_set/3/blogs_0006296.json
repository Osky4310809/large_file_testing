Nick Solares/Eater NY Brace: Bonafide ramen celebrity Ivan Orkin is opening a pizzeria today . Eater NY reports that Orkin — who is sometimes referred to simply by his restaurants’ name, Ivan Ramen — has, along with his business partner, partnered with chef Michael Bergemann to open Corner Slice , a stall in the same food hall where Orkin debuted in New York City in 2013 . Orkin first announced his pizza plans in the fall, and the pizzeria is his third restaurant in the city and fifth worldwide (his other restaurants are in Tokyo). Bergemann’s pizza philosophy, perhaps not surprisingly, jives with Orkin’s place-based approach to ramen-making . “We’re not trying to be super Italian,” Bergemann told Eater NY editor Melissa McCart. “ We’re trying to be super New York .” Similar to how Orkin uses rye flour in his New York ramen shops (but not in Tokyo), Bergemann is using a unique blend of spelt and durham wheat, making Corner Slice one of only a handful of pizzerias in the city to use “entirely artisanal” flour. Along with pizza, the stall will also serve sandwiches and baked goods, with special attention paid to the coffee program. It’s an undeniably exciting time for pizza in America. Iconic deep-dish joint Burt’s Place has just reopened in Chicago , which will also soon be home to legendary Roman pizzaiolo Gabriele Bonci’s first American outpost . On the West Coast, pizza savant Chris Bianco is bringing his signature pies to Los Angeles, in partnership with the master bakers of Tartine Manufactory .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:40:52.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
