Kennedy) and southwest (Newark Liberty). It also has a high-density flow of traffic — roughly 17 hours per day —owing to its location as the closest of all three to Manhattan. If you’re flying into LaGuardia, grab a left-side window seat—that’s where to get the better look at the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan on approach. Grab a right hand seat in the summer time and you might get a way-too-close-for-comfort look at sunbathers on Queens rooftops just before touchdown. \nLaughlin/Bullhead International Airport, Bullhead City, Ariz. \nThis west Arizona airport has mountains on three sides, north, east, and southeast, including what pilots call “terrain” on both ends of the 8,500-foot runway. As a result, departures require a steep rate of climb. Laughlin/Bullhead landed commercial service last month with a daily flight from Phoenix, so more pilots — and passengers — are holding on tight. \nMammoth Yosemite Airport, Mammoth Lakes, Calif. \nMammoth Yosemite lies in a box canyon hard east of several major peaks in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, including the namesake ski resort. In winter, the season that garners most of the commercial air service, inclement weather can present a perpetual challenge. \nRonald Reagan Washington National Airport, Arlington, Va. \nThe District of Columbia has plenty of restricted, heavily guarded airspace. Veer off course or ignore air traffic control near the Capitol and you’ll quickly find a fighter jet on your wing. These defenses also require some sharp 30-40 degree turns along the Potomac River when flying the “River Visual” approach to Reagan National Airport. (Passenger tip: Sit on the left for views of many of the major national monuments.) \nSan Diego International Airport, San Diego \nPilots report frequent gusty tailwinds that can require quick adjustments on approach. Arriving flights typically land to the west, which means passengers get a view of downtown office buildings and parking decks. Peer out the window when flying into the former Lindbergh Field — it’s a landing you won’t forget. \nTelluride Regional Airport \nAt 9,070 feet, Telluride is the highest-elevation commercial airport in America. It also features 1,000-foot cliffs on both ends of the runway and strong vertical turbulence during winter months caused by the mountain winds. There are several videos of the approach into Telluride showing the sharp plateau on which the strip is perched. “Nothing you want to do tomorrow is worth risking your life and the lives of your passengers today!” the Telluride airport says in a notice to pilots. \nYellowstone Regional Airport, Cody, Wyo. \nThis airport has a few mountains in the vicinity, but no control tower. It also requires pilots to perform what is called a “non-precision” approach, a standard procedure for a pilot but one that doesn’t offer any vertical guidance, requiring the aviator to calculate the rate of descent.
