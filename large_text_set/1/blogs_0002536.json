Up to five finalists will make it to Canton, Ohio. \nRing of Famer safety Steve Atwater and linebacker Karl Mecklenburg, both multiyear semifinalists, were not selected to the final round. \nFor Davis, advancing to the final list has been a four-year routine. The last three, of course, have ended in disappointment. \n“You showed me the doughnuts. You brought me in a doughnut store and you’re walking me around. I can see the glaze — I’m a glazed doughnut person — but you got the glass in front of me,” Davis said last August. “You’re letting me just smell it as they’re baking them. Now I can smell it, but I can’t taste them. That’s where I am. Just imagine that feeling.” \nThe biggest obstacle for Davis, the Broncos’ all-time leading rusher with 7,607 yards and 60 touchdowns, has always been time. His career was short (seven seasons, 78 games) but oh so sweet. In 1998, he tallied a league-high 2,008 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns before capping it the team’s second consecutive Super Bowl title. He was the game’s MVP in the first Super Bowl win. \nOnly Jim Brown (124.2) averaged more scrimmage yards per game than Davis (118.1). No player has as many consecutive playoff games (seven) with at least 100 rushing yards. \n“I took pride in being at my best when the moment was big,” Davis said before Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara, Calif. “That’s one thing that I can live with. I don’t know how to compare stuff to players and whether I was the best in the game when I played. I just knew that for whatever my team needed me to do or whatever the coaches asked me to do, I think I delivered.” \nLynch, one of the newest members of the Broncos’ Ring of Fame and Buccaneers’ Ring of Honor, is also a finalist for the fourth consecutive year. Lynch played the bulk of his career in Tampa Bay (1993-2003) but finished in Denver (2004-07). He was selected to the Pro Bowl every year he was in Denver and nine total in his career. \n“I think you take not only what kind of player he is, but what kind of person he is, what kind of leader he has been for two franchises — I think if you sum that up, if I were a Hall of Fame voter, I would probably take that into consideration,” Broncos president and CEO Joe Ellis said in May, when Lynch was selected to the team’s Ring of Fame. \nDawkins, who was one of three first-year eligible finalists, played his last three seasons (2009-11) of his career in Denver after spending 13 in Philadelphia. All told, he earned nine Pro Bowl selections and five first-team all-pro honors. \n“Blessed By The Best!!” he tweeted Tuesday evening. \nThe modern-era finalists plus one senior finalist — former safety Kenny Easley — and two contributor finalists — Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue — will be up for vote by the selection committee during their meeting the day before Super Bowl LI.
