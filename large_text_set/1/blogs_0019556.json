Skeptics said the guarantee against so-called ransomware was a marketing gimmick.\nOther cybersecurity companies claim they can block almost every attack, Grossman said in an interview with Fortune . But they fail to put their money where their mouths are.\n“Let them warranty it,” Grossman said. “I want to believe it.”\nNow SentinelOne is landing millions of its own. On Wednesday the firm said it raised $70 million in new venture capital funding. The company, which sells a product to supplant traditional antivirus software, has raised $110 million since its founding in 2013.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nRedpoint Ventures, a Menlo Park, Calif.-based venture capital firm that has also backed Stripe stripe , Netflix nflx , and cybersecurity company Fortinet ftnt , led the latest round. Also joining the series C round were actor Ashton Kutcher and rock musician manager Guy Oseary’s venture capital firm Sound Ventures, as well as existing investors Third Point Ventures, Data Collective, Granite Hill Capital Partners, Westly Group, and SineWave Ventures.\n(Full disclosure: Time Inc. time , Fortune’s parent company, is a SentinelOne customer.)\nTomer Weingarten, CEO of SentinelOne, backed up Grossman’s money-in-mouth philosophy at the recent meeting with Fortune in New York. “There’s a lot of marketing out there,” he said of his company’s competitors, mentioning that the industry will benefit from more companies insuring their claims.\nSo far SentinelOne has not had to cough up funds to cover any breaches, Weingarten said . That is good news because the firm is continuing to place more corporate networks under its protection. Today, the 175-person team, with offices in offices in Palo Alto, Tel Aviv, and Paris, has about 400 customers worldwide.\nSentinelOne competes with a number of companies in an area of cybersecurity that is often dubbed, with a healthy dose of marketing brio, “next generation antivirus.” In addition to unseating incumbents like Symantec symc and Intel Security’s intc spinout McAfee, the company goes head-to-head with rivals such as Cylance, Carbon Black, CrowdStrike, and Invincea.\nLike its competitors, SentinelOne has been growing primarily at the expense of traditional antivirus vendors. As more companies migrate to the cloud, network defense has required rethinking, leaving an opening for upstart challengers.\nFor more on cybersecurity, watch: \n“This is a $10 billion global market opportunity that is ripe for disruption,” said Tom Dyal, a Redpoint partner who joined SentinelOne’s board as part of the deal, in a statement. \nWeingarten said that he plans to use the latest round of funding to aggressively boost SentinelOne’s sales and marketing in the coming months. Though he declined to reveal his company’s revenue figures, Weingarten said that he is aiming to grow sales by 400% this year.
