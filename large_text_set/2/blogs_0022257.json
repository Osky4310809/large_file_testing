If the 76ers don’t get the pick this year, it conveys into two second-round picks – one in 2017 and one 2018. So Philadelphia might end up trading a lottery pick (Noel was taken sixth in 2013) for a former first-rounder (Anderson was picked 21st in the 2015 draft) and two second-round picks. \nNoel, who is a restricted free agent after this season, is playing just 19.5 minutes per game, but his per-36 minute averages are enticing: 16.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, 2.7 steals and 1.7 blocks. He will be able to help Dallas offensively and defensively.

He’s a quality rebounder, can develop into an even better defender, but he needs to improve his shot. He’s shooting just 40.2% from the field and 30.3% on three-pointers. \nIt is possible Bogut will be bought out by the Sixers. \nThe Vertical was first to report the deal.
