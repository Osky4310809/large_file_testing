It looks wild . The further into this trailer you get, the crazier the effects and animations become. \nI don't really understand most of what I'm seeing here -- and the story is densely layered, to say the least -- but the feeling it evokes is special. Can the game possibly be this cool? That'd be something. \nCreator Studio Koba describes Narita Boy as \"inspired by retro pixel adventures ( Castlevania , Another World , Double Dragon ) with a modern touch (Superbrothers, Sword and Sorcery ) and an 80s plot homage ( Ready Player One , He-Man , The Last Starfighter ), accompanied by the retro synth touch of the old glory days.\" Also it has \"Boy\" in its name, and I'm all about that.
