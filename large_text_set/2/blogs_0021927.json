It has to stop,” Trump told MSNBC’s Craig Melvin on Tuesday.\nAsked if he was denouncing it once and for all, Trump replied, “Of course. I do it whenever I get a chance, I do it.”\nTrump continued addressing the issue after taking a tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC.\n“The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” he told reporters.\nThe recent spate of bomb threats began on Jan. 9; other incidents were recorded on Jan. 18 and 31, with more taking place Monday. All were found to be hoaxes.\nThe Jewish Community Center at Delaware and Summer is evacuated, Buffalo Police on the scene.\n— John Hickey (@jhickeyBN) ID: 10567308 In addition to the bomb threats, vandals knocked over and damaged more than 100 headstones on Monday at the Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery in St. Louis.\n\nOfficers responded to a report of vandalism around 8:30 p.m., according to CNN .\nBuzzFeed News has reached out to the University City Police Department for more information related to the act of vandalism.\nThe specificity of Trump’s comments Tuesday differed from those offered by White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday after the bomb threats.\n“Hatred and hate-motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom,” Spicer said in a statement . “The President has made it abundantly clear that these actions are unacceptable.”\nMany people were critical of the White House for neglecting to mention the Jewish community in its statement, including Hillary and Chelsea Clinton .\nJCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS.\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) ID: 10567287 Funny how you HAVE TO call it \"radical Islamic terrorism\", but with Antisemitism, you can't even mention the Jewish… https://t.co/mPW8zduANZ\n— Amarnath Amarasingam (@AmarAmarasingam) ID: 10567289 Ivanka Trump tweeted Monday that society “must protect our houses of worship and religious centers #JCC.”\nThe Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect released a statement shortly after the president’s comments, calling his late acknowledgement late and insufficient.\n“The President’s sudden acknowledgement is a Band-Aid on the cancer of Antisemitism that has infected his own Administration,” the statement read.\n“His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting Antisemitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record. Make no mistake: The Antisemitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration.”\nRead the full statement here:\nFacebook Post .
