Sadly you (probably) won't be able to participate. Photo: Apple \nApple will celebrate Chinese New Year by giving away pairs of Beats Solo3 headphones in its Product (RED) variant — which just so happens to also be a color associated with good luck and prosperity in various Asian cultures. \nUnfortunately, if you’re reading this in the U.S., the giveaway isn’t available to you — but rather to customers in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. Which we guess makes total sense, given the occasion! \nTo be eligible, customers must buy select Mac or iPhone products as part of a one-day sale, which will take place starting 8AM on January 6. The products in question include any iMac, the MacBook Pro (minus the new model with Touch Bar), MacBook Air, Mac Pro, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, or iPhone 7 Plus. \nThe offer is available in both online and brick-and-mortar stores. \nApple tends to be pretty good at localizing its services to local markets. It has done this particularly well in China, which Tim Cook has previously said he expects to soon represent Apple’s biggest global market — and has noted the company designs its new products with the Chinese audience in mind . \nLast year, Apple did a similar giveaway in China, as well as introducing a well-timed Apple Watch red color option for the occasion. It has also previously offered Chinese New Year sales in select Asian markets, which is something it rarely does in the U.S. \nWill 2017 be a year of good luck for Apple in China? We’ll have to wait to find out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T18:51:15.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
