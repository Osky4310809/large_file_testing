To the extent that they are saying that the only way to God is through Jesus, that cannot be a truth.”. . . \nMichael Overd and Michael Stockwell have been ordered to pay £2,016 each, in fines and costs. They will appeal the conviction. \n[Keep reading. . .]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T12:27:23.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
