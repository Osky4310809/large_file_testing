The Atlanta rapper claims that the reason he and Breezy are on the path to fisticuffs is the R&B singer’s ex-girlfriend, Rihanna. \nSitting down for an exclusive interview with Hollywood Unlocked, Soulja Boy was flanked by his trainer for his upcoming boxing match with Brown. An animated Soulja explained from his vantage point on how their issues originally began and not over Karrueche Tran . \n“What he really mad about is I was with Rihanna,” said Soulja. “Ain’t nobody woulda never knew that, nigga, if he ain’t call my phone trippin’ over Karrueche. I was with Rihanna, son. Rihanna, nigga!” \nSoulja continued by saying that he was at the same 2009 Grammy Awards party that Brown and Rihanna attended and was blown away by the news of their domestic violence incident the next night. Soulja explains that shortly after the event, he was on tour with Lil Wayne and Rihanna’s management reached out to him to have her attend the show. \nHowever, the wrinkle in the tale is that Soulja was dating Teyana Taylor (yes, that Teyana Taylor ) and allegedly kicked her off the tour bus while Rihanna visited so he could console her. He adds that Taylor called Brown in anger and told him that Rihanna and Soulja were together. \nSoulja then says that Rihanna invited him over to her New York hotel for a movie night with her and some friends, which he claims Brown called and questioned him about. \nThe “Crank That’ star didn’t try to present facts that he and Rihanna were an item, but there are many moving parts in the bizarre tale. Soulja turned the heat up on the matter by way of a series of tweets on Sunday (January 8), including clowning Brown for using Mike Tyson as his trainer for their event and throwing even lower blows. Peep the chatter below. \nCheck out the tweets below and the video above. \nDon’t miss DX’s latest Breakdown about Soulja Boy, Nicki Minaj and 2017’s thirsty beginning.
