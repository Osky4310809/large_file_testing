Brown is quickly becoming one of the hottest names in Hollywood. Brown experienced a breakout role in The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story as Christopher Darden, and continued his success on the small screen by joining NBC’s This Is Us , one of the biggest new series of the past year. With television conquered, Brown has set his sights on bigger projects. Not many can quite match the ensemble of his upcoming superhero related project Black Panther , and yet one superhero role is not enough for him as he is also campaigning to play John Stewart in the Green Lantern Corps movie.\nSuperhero franchises aside, Brown is continuing to build off his incredible string of performances over the past year. Now, it looks like he will be the latest member to join Shane Black’s highly anticipated alien assassin flick The Predator .\nTHR is reporting that Brown is in talks to join the cast of The Predator as a government agent. The conflict of his character will reportedly come after he locks away the film’s lead Boyd Holbrook and must then let him go free so he can fight off the Predator epidemic that is tearing through the suburbs.\nAfter initially losing Benicio Del Toro in the lead, Black has rebounded in an impressive way to bring in quality talent for every role so far. While none of the attached cast members are the prototypical headliners in Hollywood, it is hard to say this isn’t a cast that has come together nicely. Outside of Holbrook now in the lead, Moonlight star Trevante Rhodes , comedian Keegan-Michael Key , and Olivia Munn are set to fill out the cast in different aspects.\nThe report from THR also mentions of multiple Predators making an appearance in this film, so it could be all hands on deck to stop them. Brown’s description of a government agent does not do a great job at showing how involved in the action he could be. For all we know, he could be a special operations leader trained in combat that makes him a viable addition to this mini-army so far assembled. However, he could also fall into the category that is not uncommon with big action films of being the terrified and unqualified government man that is roped in. Based on Brown’s track record, the former is much more likely and would suit his talents better as an actor, but there is no telling what Black has imagined. With production reportedly beginning later this month , these details could become official shortly.\nSource: THR", "external_links": ["http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sterling-k-brown-calls-black-panther-something-special.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sterling-k-brown-calls-black-panther-something-special.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sterling-k-brown-calls-black-panther-something-special.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sterling-k-brown-calls-black-panther-something-special.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sterling-k-brown-calls-black-panther-something-special.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1417&h=708&fit=crop", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sterling-k-brown-talks-join-shane-blacks-predator-966205", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sterling-k-brown-calls-black-panther-something-special.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://omegaunderground.com/2016/11/06/predator-begins-filming-february-ends-mid-may/", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sterling-k-brown-calls-black-panther-something-special.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sterling-k-brown-calls-black-panther-something-special.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-20T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T08:54:19.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
