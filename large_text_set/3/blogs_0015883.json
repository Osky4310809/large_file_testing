The natural progression of thoughts then ensued. \"Maybe he should have recused himself from the case. Just a maybe? Were they best friends in Hawaii? Were they part of the Choom Gang, smoking pot and hanging out and doing a little bit of weed and maybe even a little blow?\"   Hannity's segment echoed the right-wing conspiracy theory circulating in recent days that Obama's recent trip to Hawaii was somehow connected to the judge's ruling. \"Now, just to put a fine point on this, Obama made a surprise visit to Hawaii 48 hours before the judge blocked the Trump travel ban,\" Hannity said. \"Did he see his buddy? I'm not saying he did.\" No, of course he's not. That would be preposterous, and certainly beyond his knowledgeâ€•unlike the whole drug thing, of course. Most Popular The suggestion that the timing of Obama's trip was beyond mere coincidence surfaced earlier Thursday in an article published on the conservative news site Independent Journalism Revie w. The post, which mapped out connections between the former President and the judge as well as the details of Obama's trip itinerary, was later retracted . \"IJR published an article that does not meet our editorial standards or represent IJR's vision or values. We have retracted the story, and we deeply regret the error.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T06:23:42.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
