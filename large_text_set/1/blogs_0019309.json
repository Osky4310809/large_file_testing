She served as President Obama's Deputy State Department spokeswoman from July 2013 to May 2015, often providing the press updates on the White House's efforts to combat terror abroad. One of the most memorable moments of her tenure, however, was in 2015 when she told MSNBC's Chris Matthews that the U.S. could not defeat ISIS by killing them and suggested that poverty is what led terrorists to the battlefield in the first place. She received plenty of criticism for the remark, but shrugged it off by saying they were simply too \" nuanced .\" \nFollowing her highly public role Harf became the senior advisor for strategic communications to Secretary of State John Kerry and we hadn't heard much from her for the past couple of years. Now it appears she'll be on our TV screens again. Fox News has hired Harf to provide analysis on national security and politics, according to the network. She will appear on both Fox News and Fox Business. \nHarf's first chance to provide some expertise on Fox will be Monday at 7 p.m. ET on Martha MacCullum's new show, \"The First 100 Days.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:38:21.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
