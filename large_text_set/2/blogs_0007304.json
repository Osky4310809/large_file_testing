King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 9 hours ago 0 \nProminent metal journalist and host Eddie Trunk offered a rant against metal musicians and fans praising Lady Gaga, saying that if she really loved metal so much, the pop star would be making metal music.He said: \"Who would have thought this woman cured cancer yesterday during the Super Bowl? People are falling all over themselves, like, what the hell happened? I saw some clips online, it's a nice pop show, but really? Again, talented woman, all good, but here's the thing that makes me bonkers when it comes to Lady Gaga in my world. \n\"People saying, 'Hey, lets support her. Metal fans, let support her, 'cause she's a metal fan.' We've been hearing this narrative about this woman for years because she showed up at a KISS show or an Iron Maiden show. OK, that's great, but stop with the metal thing! \n\"If you were truly into hard rock and metal, you'd play it! You'd support it, you'd embrace it! I can't comprehend how people can say this. Please stop with this! If she was truly, truly into metal, she wouldn't be playing pop music! She's a pop artist. \n\"Great, maybe she likes an Iron Maiden song, maybe she likes ' Run to the Hills ' or she's heard it one time. Maybe she knows ' Rock N' Roll All Nite ,' but something tells me I can't sit down with her and talk about the guitar solo in ' Plaster Caster ' off [1977 KISS album] ' Love Gun .' \n\"So everybody calm down with this whole 'She's a rocker, so let's get behind her' thing. All due respect to her and what she does, but I'm not gonna sit there and run around screaming at the brilliance of Lady Gaga! She's good at what she does in that realm, but stop trying to make her a rockstar! What, 'cause she wore a Metallica shirt once?! I hate that! Sorry, sorry everybody, I just gotta tell it like I see it. \n\"I see these metal guys on Twitter tweeting, 'Remember, she's a metalhead.' Then play it! If you call yourself a metalhead and you live and die to support this music, then how the hell do you make music that you make?! It doesn't make any sense! Nothing against that music; if that's what you're into, great!\" \nTrunk concluded: \"So which one is it? You're gonna tell me you really like that diverse spread of music that one minute you're listening to ' Hell Awaits ' by Slayer and the next minute you're making music that sounds like Madonna? C'mon! So again, I'm sure she likes some rock or whatever, but we gotta stop with this 'She's into metal.' C'mon! \n\"Until we see her make a metal record, it ain't metal to me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:49:30.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
