If you can entice the opposition out a bit, by let’s say knocking it around in your own area for a bit instead of hammering it up to Diego (Costa) from the keeper every time, then maybe they will creep forward.\n‘If the Arsenal attackers then chase into your area, their midfielders must back them up and then their defenders must push up to the halfway line. Now to be fair, Arsenal had to win this game so they were keen to get control, but leaving half of Stamford Bridge free for our players to attack seemed to be bordering on naive.’\nChelsea fixtures Burnley (A) – Sun 12 Feb\nSwansea (H) – Sat 25 Feb\nWest Ham (A) – Mon 6 Mar\nWatford (H) – Mon 13 Mar\nStoke (A) – Sat 18 Mar\nCrystal Palace (H) – Sat 1 Apr\nManchester City (H) – Wed 5 Apr\nMORE: Exposed: Ozil and Sanchez laziness highlighted in Chelsea defeat \nMORE: Courtois on the key Conte quality that has improved Chelsea ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:30:23.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
