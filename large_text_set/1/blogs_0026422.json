We came here with hope of peace and love,” Ati Ramani said. \nRamani says she was waiting at the International terminal at Logan for her friend Sona for several hours. Friends Sona and Ati (left and center) reunite at Logan Airport Sunday. (WBZ-TV) \n“Although she’s a green card holder, I was not really sure if I could see her again,” Ramani said. \n“I was worried for everything and now I’m okay,” Sona said. \nBoth women are Iranian natives now living in Boston. \nAti Ramani is a doctoral student at UMass-Amherst. \nTheir native country, along with six others that are predominantly Muslim, are part of a travel ban in a new executive order signed by President Trump. \n“I really don’t have a good feeling right now,” Ati said. \nSona went to Iran to visit her family for vacation. She was supposed to return on February 10th. But after the president’s ban and as of early Sunday morning, a federal judge’s imposed temporary restraining order, she took the opportunity to return to the United States. \nSona says through it all, she held onto her faith. \n“I thank God, think about everything and I praise God,” Sona said. \nIn addition, an Iranian woman who lives in Hopkinton waited four hours Sunday for her husband to get through customs at Logan. He traveled back to Boston from Iran for his father’s funeral. A volunteer immigration attorney said detaining someone for that long after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order is questionable. \n“Clearly, these practices are unconstitutional, they’re unjust. They go against what America stands for,” Emily Amara Gordon said. \nAttorney Howard Silverman has been at the airport helping families at the airport since 7 a.m. \n“I’ve been doing this for 32 years. I’ve never seen anything like this. I think it’s dangerous. I think it sets a dangerous precedent,” Silverman told WBZ. \n“I believe everything will be all right. People really support us here and I really appreciate them,” Ramani said. \nAti’s positivity is reassured by protesters, showing solidarity for all immigrants entering the U.S. from Boston. \n“My father came over to get away from persecution in Nazi Germany. So it’s very important to us to feel that this country is still welcoming,” David Hoffer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:47:44.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
