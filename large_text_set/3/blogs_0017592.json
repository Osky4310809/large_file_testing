Goode” and “Roll Over Beethoven,” inspiring teenagers Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who later covered Berry’s songs along with countless others, ranging from the Beach Boys to the Kinks to Judas Priest to Phish to the Sex Pistols. As Richards said when inducting Berry into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame:“I’ve stolen every lick he ever played.”\nBerry also had some difficulties with the law, and in 1961 he was convicted of violating the federal Mann Act prohibiting the transportation of a minor across state lines for “immoral purposes.” He received a three-year jail sentence for employing an underage Texas prostitute in his St. Louis club.\nFrom Variety :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:43:39.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
