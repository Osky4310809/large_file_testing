Thanks for your reaction Don’t forget to share this with your friends! ← Use Arrows Keys → 1 Gabby Douglas's New Lipstick Collection Will Have You Doing Backflips \nGabby Douglas may have earned the most prestigious Olympic honors, but she can now add \"beauty boss\" to her flourishing list of credentials. The athlete has teamed up with indie cosmetics brand Beauty Bakerie to customize her very own collection of lipsticks deserving of its own gold medals. In an official press release, Gabby shared that she's always wanted to create a line of lipsticks, and we're psyched that her first dabble into the cosmetics world is with a fun brand like Beauty Bakerie. \nIf you aren't already familiar with the label, prepare to be obsessed. The entire range of cosmetics is cruelty-free, is vegan, and serves up the most delectable iterations of our favorite products. Some of its sweetest offerings include highlighting powder served in mini ice cream tubs, \"flour\" to bake your face, and the line's Insta-famous \"Lip Whips,\" which come in a variety of hues from muted nudes to oceanic blues. \nFor her exclusive collection, Gabby created five lipstick shades with equally enticing names: \"Cherry Flambe,\" a bright crimson; \"Triple Berry Mousse,\" a mauve nude; \"Hazelnut Swirl,\" a metallic gold; \"Plum Sorbet,\" vampy royal purple; and \"Sangria Splash,\" a vibrant berry. Each lipstick delivers insane color payoff and a matte finish. They're also outfitted in the signature Lip Whip bottle (that looks like a unicorn horn) with red, white, and blue decals. \nFans of Gabby and Beauty Bakerie will be able to snag all five shades for $80, which is a steal considering each Lip Whip retails for $20. But while the official launch date has not yet been revealed, you can expect an announcement this March in Beauty Bakerie's Neapolitan Newsletter . We'll also be sure to update you with more information as it becomes available. In the meantime, read on to get a closer look at the insanely adorable set.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:18:22.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
