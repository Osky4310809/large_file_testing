Voss tested positive for the antibodies present in AD-36. Though the virus does eventually leave the body, “the damage is permanent,” Dhurandhar told WTMJ-TV . \n“We call it hit-and-run phenomenon,” Dhurandhar said. “It is possible it comes in and turns something off or something on.” \nDhurandhar says that while there’s not a specific treatment for obesity that stems from a viral infection, the treatment for cases like Voss’s can be similar to those used for any type of obesity. For Voss, the discovery turned out to be “absolutely liberating.” After having a gastric procedure in his late 50s, Voss had more energy. Now he’s 64 and down to 165 pounds thanks to a strict eating regimen and exercise routine. “It was just such a miracle that I found out about it when I did,” Voss said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:19:43.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
