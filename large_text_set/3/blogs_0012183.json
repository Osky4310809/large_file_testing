So this change should mean that Netflix viewers will rate more shows more often – resulting in more data for Netflix. \nNetflix also announced that some of this data will be used for a new percent-match feature – designed to indicate how good of a match a show or movie is for you. So if Netflix thinks you’ll really like a show you could see a 95% or even 100% match. It’s almost like a Rotten Tomatoes rating customized for your liking. \nThe company also shared some interesting stats surrounding ratings – at one point more than 50% of all members had rated more than 50 different titles on Netflix, including over 10 billion total 5-star ratings. \nThe changes will roll out within the next month or so for users globally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T08:21:04.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
