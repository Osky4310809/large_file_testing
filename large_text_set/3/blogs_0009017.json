The company has been offering some great discounts on both handsets recently. It shaved off $250 on the Sprint variant of both models and also offered a similar discount for the T-Mobile Galaxy S7 edge . It also threw in a free 128GB microSD card with both offers. \nWhile those offers are still running, Samsung is out with a new offer that provides a flat $100 discount on the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 edge. It doesn’t matter if you purchase the handset on Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint or just go with an unlocked variant. \nSamsung will give you $100 off on both models if you purchase one from its online store . That’s not all, Samsung will also give customers a free 64GB microSD card with each purchase of the Galaxy S7 and a 128GB card with the Galaxy S7 edge. \nThis is a great way for Samsung to clear some inventory of last year’s flagship as it gears up to launch the Galaxy S8 later this month . It’s very beneficial for those who’ve always wanted to purchase a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge but remained on the fence because they didn’t want to spend too much on a smartphone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:15:39.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
