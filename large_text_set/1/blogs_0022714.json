This Ad About a Boy’s Oversized Glasses Has the Most Heart-Wrenching Twist Watch More Videos > \nIf you’ve been in need of a good cry lately, then you’ve come to the right place. Pearle Vision has just released a tearjerker of an ad called “Ben’s Glasses,” and well, let’s just say you might want to grab some tissues before you watch this one. \nReleased on YouTube earlier this week, the short commercial features a boy named Ben, whose glasses are in serious need of an upgrade. \nHis oversized spectacles regularly slip right off the ridge of his nose and onto the floor. \nThey make it hard to read … Image Source: Pearle Vision/YouTube \nAnd to see what he’s doing … Image Source: Pearle Vision/YouTube… \nAnd … well, they pretty much make it impossible to do just about anything with ease. Image Source: Pearle Vision/YouTube \nBut the truth is, Ben loves his glasses, and everything they represent. \nThey help him see the world in a unique way. Image Source: Pearle Vision/YouTube \nAnd they’ve become something of a constant companion, as he moves through the world alone. Image Source: Pearle Vision/YouTube \nBut the real reason why Ben won’t part with them is revealed at the end of the clip — and it will melt your heart. Specifically, at the 0:58 mark. But it’ll be so worth it. \n(Just don’t say I didn’t warn you!)
