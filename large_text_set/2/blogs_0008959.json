Underwood’s is covered in sparkles, while Hill’s feels more classic. Both blonde bombshells are involved in tonight’s ceremony. Hill and her husband fellow country crooner Tim McGraw are presenting awards tonight. Meanwhile, Underwood is performing with Keith Urban, and she’s also up for a Country Solo Performance Grammy for her hit “Church Bells.”\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images Country music is well-represented at this year’s awards . Nashville rebel Sturgill Simpson is nominated in the Album of the Year category for his record “A Sailor’s Guide To Earth,” and he’ll also perform. Also on the performance schedule are Maren Morris (who’s playing with Alicia Keys), Little Big Town, and Kelsea Ballerini (who’s nominated for Best New Artist).\nJohn Shearer/Getty Images Coincidentally, Hill and Underwood have chafed before, at another awards ceremony, way way back in 2006. When Underwood won female vocalist at the CMA Awards , Hill was recorded throwing her arms up in the air and frowning. She later apologized, calling it a joke gone wrong. No bad blood to see here, folks.\nGood luck to both these blonde bombshells! Both legends in their own right no matter what they’re wearing.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:43:09.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
