The whole episode is an outrage, including the fact that while police were called to the scene of this birthday party, they made no arrests. \nBut what especially appalled me after watching video of the two racists crying in court during their sentencing was the repeated claim by one of them, in the course of an apology, that her criminal behavior “wasn’t me.” \nSorry ma’am – that was you. \nDon’t blame the booze, your friends, politics or anything else. \nAll sorts of people get angry, nurse grudges, and suffer from problems. But you chose to terrorize innocent people, and now you can pay the price, blubbering apologies in court notwithstanding. \nRemember – actions have consequences.
