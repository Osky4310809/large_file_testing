He will be dancing during THON 2017 representing Springfield. \nEveryone has a different reason to participate in Penn State THON, and that is no different for Michael Makowski, a THON dancer and Springfield’s canning captain. \n“I THON basically to pick up this fight for all those who had to put it down,” Makowski (senior-biochemistry and molecular biology) said. \nAbout three years ago one of his very good friends, Kelcey Hallinan, passed away due to Hodgkin’s lymphoma. \n“She was one of the most beautiful and talented souls I think I have ever met in my entire life,” Makowski said with a cracking voice. \nHe recalled a quote by the late ESPN host, Stuart Scott, who said someone does not lose their battle with cancer. It is not a win-lose situation. A person wins by how they live. \nHe said she was one of the strongest people he had ever seen go through this. \n“I vowed after that to do everything I could to make sure nobody has to go through that again,” Makowski said. \nMakowski continuously pointed to Kelcey’s “strength.” Because of this, he joined the THON special interest organization, Springfield, his sophomore year. He said he fell in love with both the organization and the cause. \nMakowski said when Kelcey was just 18, she was stronger than he would ever be. \n“One of the coolest parts about THON to me is that on every canning weekend, every fundraiser I see in the HUB and that one weekend in February I get to see a bit of her, and her love and her courage in all of the volunteers,” Makowski said with pause. “That’s why I keep fighting.” \nMakowski also talked about what THON weekend does for families. He mentioned in his previous four years of going to THON he had seen people smile who “hadn’t smiled in months.” He said the weekend shouldered the load of the kids who are impacted by cancer. \nHe said every day he tries to live in Kelcey’s honor, and he will be applying to medical school to study pediatric oncology. \nIt is still hard for him sometimes, though. \n“The same thing that gets me up in the morning and gets me going is just trying to do her justice,” Makowski said. \nKeeping the fight going for those who can no longer fight is what he said will keep him going during those 46 grueling hours on the floor of the Bryce Jordan Center. \nHe met Kelcey in high school in their hometown of Dunmore, Pa. He was two years older than her. They would hang out during marching band. They were both alto saxophone players. They also acted in school plays together. \n“I thought she was just a shy unassuming freshman,” Makowski said. “I was sort of like in a pseudo-leadership [position] within the band. \nWhen the band travelled to Disney World the two became much closer. The two spent the school year together surrounded by friends, but over the summer they noticed a change. \n“She’d be sick, and not up to all of the crazy high school shenanigans we would be up for,” he said. “I saw her less and less, and she would be, more often than not, too tired or too sick. At the end of the summer, I kind of moved on to bigger, maybe not better things — going to college. I lost a little bit of contact with that group of friends. \nThis loss of contact with his friends is something that Makowski says he would never forgive himself for. \nEarly on in his freshman year while in class, Makowski received an urgent call from his friend saying Kelcey had been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. \nHe immediately ran back into his class, Googled the disease and tried to learn as much about the disease as possible. \nThroughout the year, Makowski said he stayed glued to his phone waiting for updates. \nHe then recalled the “second worst” phone call he ever got in his life, about how Kelcey’s health was in decline. \n“The way it looked, they were going to stop treatment, which I imagine is an awful decision to make,” he said with glassy eyes. \nA few months after this, Makowski got “the worst” phone call he had ever gotten. \n“I got the call in the middle of the night that she had passed away surrounded by her family and everyone she loved,” Makowski said. “That kind of rocked my world.” \nThe news hit him hard, and it was around that time that he “aligned” himself with both THON and Springfield, because he saw from the beginning to the end how hard going through cancer is and how hard it was for her family. \nMakowski now wears a bracelet around his wrist that spells out “Kelcey” along with a few others. \n“I’m kind of corny like that. I like to keep mementos that are important to me that kind of keep me grounded,” he said. +1 \nMike Makowski (senior-biochemistry and molecular biology) wears a bracelet honoring his friend, Kelcey Hallinan. \nA friend of his made the bracelet for him for the first THON after she passed away. \n“She surprised me at the beginning of THON. This is after a year of just kind of not knowing what was going on,” he said. \nMakowski said this was the moment when he realized the members of Springfield and THON as a whole were “his people.” \nHe also has a thin blue piece of yarn wrapped around his wrist, which he explained was part of a bonding moment between him and his organization. \n“The lesson is that we’re all kind of intertwined in this fight,” he said. “That was really the first time I kind of looked around and recognized that this was really special to me. It kind of reminds me to stay grounded and keep doing what I’m doing, and to keep fighting. \nHis third bracelet is from when he was a dancer relations committee member last year. He said it was the closest he had ever felt to “that love.” \nMakowski recounted walking into the BJC for the last shift. He was the last one out. \n“My captain stops, he puts his arm around me, he looks around and he says ‘welcome home,’” he said. “I looked around, and I looked at the Springfield section — everyone was going wild at hour 36. People had been there for 20 plus hours. Dancers are still dancing, people are still picking up kids — squirting them with water guns. People are smiling that haven’t smiled in months, and I realized I was home. This is home.” \nOne of the first things many may notice about Makowski is his long hair, which he plans to make long enough in order to donate it to someone who lost their hair due to cancer. \nHe credited this idea to Kelcey, saying she was always self-conscious about her hair because she had been losing it. Makowski said it was the one thing she was nervous about until she had a wig donated to her. \n“She thought it was the coolest thing in the world,” he said. “It looked exactly like her hair. She had long, black, really nice hair. \nMakowski said he thought it was the “coolest” thing in the world to him — the fact someone gave up their hair “to make my friend feel as beautiful as we knew [she was].” \n“[I want to] grow it out until it’s ready to donate in the hopes that I can have that kind of impact on someone,” Makowski said. \nEven though he originally applied to, and was admitted to, Penn State as a creative writing major, he is now studying biochemistry. \n“I redid all of my stuff and came in as a biochemistry major not really knowing where I was going to go with it,” Makowski said. \nHe added medical school was a more recent goal of his, only happening in the past two or three years, but what he has witnessed greatly impacted his decision. \n“I have a personal stake now in this fight, not just for my friend but for pretty much everyone. That’s why I want to continue my involvement in THON in a way,” Makowski said. \nHe wanted to help, to do anything he could. So now, for his fifth and final THON, he will be dancing, representing Springfield, their families, Kelcey and the memories of all those who could no longer fight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:00:44.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
