With five holes left, Yang was 17 under and had a four-shot advantage over 2011 US Women's Open champion Ryu So Yeon, whose completed third-round 68 gave her the clubhouse lead at 13-under 203. The tournament was already behind schedule after rain and unplayable course conditions saw the unfinished second round postponed to Saturday at the Siam Country Club Pattaya Old Course . The 2015 champion and 11th-ranked Yang was among five players to start their second round in the morning, including second-ranked Ariya Jutanugarn. Yang had six birdies and a bogey for a second-round 67 and overall 11-under 133 and heads into the third round with a one-shot lead over Jutanugarn (68) and Chinese Shanshan Feng (67). In less than an hour, Yang went back for the third round and had two birdies - and an eagle on the seventh - for 15 under after eight holes. Play was stopped again because of lightning for more than an hour and Yang sank more birdies on Nos. 10 and 11 on resumption before bad light caused a suspension. Jutanugarn is 10 under overall with five holes to complete. Feng is also 10 under with four holes left from the third round. Play resumes at 7 a.m. local time on Sunday.
