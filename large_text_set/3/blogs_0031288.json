We call on the United States government to utilize whatever resources it deems necessary and effective to help the spiders in their noble cause. We're sending our petition to Sen. Al Franken because he's one of the few people in Washington who we sort of half-trust to not initiate surveillance on us or flag our tax returns for signing such a petition.\"\nThe WaPo piece that kicked off Darnielle's bid for swift human extinction bases its analysis on a study published this month on the global spider population's eating habits.\nResearchers Martin Nyffeler and Klaus Birkhofer found that spiders the world over consume, in total, between 400 and 800-million tons of prey per year. It's a set of numbers large enough to trigger a fear-induced blackout for anyone with arachnophobia.\nAfter a bit of numbers crunching, WaPo guesses that the world's spiders could end us all in a year, if they really felt the need. So far, they've taken mercy on us.\nIf this is the prologue to the human vs. spider war I've gotta say, its characters are way overdrawn\n— Alanna Bennett (@AlannaBennett) March 28, 2017\nHow about not every human but I'll recommend some names via DM to @hiwearespiders ? https://t.co/COCPGRXQNH\n— man on spider (@Tony_Pumilia) March 28, 2017\nAnd while others were grappling with the concept of death-by-spider, Darnielle chose to take an active approach to the issue.\nI started a petition to help the spiders eat every human on earth https://t.co/X0rAc35m8T via @Change\n— The Mountain Goats (@mountain_goats) March 28, 2017\nWith 335 supporters and counting, others have embraced his cause with enthusiasm.\nHappy 2017.\nPlease give https://t.co/nqhQG2BaWq\n— Reyhan Harmanci (@harmancipants) March 28, 2017\nIt's going to be a great year! https://t.co/mLtUpg3Dp4\n— Maura Judkis (@MauraJudkis) March 28, 2017\nGuys, @mountain_goats made the only petition worth signing. https://t.co/bczvAiIzKZ\n— Paul DeBenedetto (@pauldebenedetto) March 28, 2017\nchange you can believe in https://t.co/zedUZITEwD\n— Shane D.
