It's unacceptable for Las Aguilas to have finished Saturday's Clasico Nacional without a single shot on goal . \nHeading into next weekend's Clasico Joven , Jemez and La Volpe's jobs could well be on the line. \n2. Pumas come from behind in six-goal thriller vs. Xolos \nAfter coming back from a 3-0 deficit against Club Tijuana, Pumas' midfielder Abraham Gonzalez admitted that sometimes his team gives the impression that it likes to suffer. \nBut in the second half, Pumas made it look easy, scoring three times in 16 minutes to earn a point. It was a resounding response after Xolos had given a first 65 minutes that suggested they may be the first visitors to walk away from Ciudad Universitaria with a win this season. \nAfter a strong start to the Clausura, Miguel \"Piojo\" Herrera's Xolos have only been able to get one point of a possible six. Sunday's tie in Mexico City certainly felt like a loss. Nicolas Castillo struck first for Pumas in the 72nd minute as 'Paco' Palencia's team came from 3-0 down to draw Tijuana 3-3. \n3. Pachuca falls at Monterrey, puts focus on CONCACAF \nOver at Pachuca, there's one main objective in everyone's mind: winning the CONCACAF Champions League. Walking away victorious this campaign would earn Los Tuzos their fifth such title, and so great is their obsession that coach Diego Alonso decided to rest Jonathan Urretaviscaya, Hirving \"Chucky\" Lozano, Erick Gutierrez, Omar Gonzalez and Franco Jara in their visit to Monterrey, a repeat of the 2016 Clausura final. \nThe decision to leave the team's attacking force on the bench had its risks and Monterrey made Pachuca pay by grabbing a 1-0 win. What's worrying at Los Tuzos' camp is that in their last six Liga MX matches, they have only scored three goals. Against Rayados , Pachuca only took one shot on goal. \nNow, Alonso's team has its eyes set on Tuesday's trip to Saprissa, one of the giants of Costa Rican football. \n4. Violence in stands mars Tigres' trip to Veracruz \nAndre-Pierre Gignac, Luis Quinones and Jurgen Damm scored their first goals of the Clausura to give Tigres a much-needed 3-0 win over Veracruz, but there was much more to the story. \nNewcomers Eduardo Vargas and Luis Advincula went the full 90 minutes, as they continue to adapt to their new teammates and Liga MX. The latter played as if he's been in Mexico his entire career, while Vargas looked out of position, which caused him to have a quiet performance. \nAfter the final whistle, the weak and small police force at Estadio Luis \"Pirata\" Fuente was unable to break apart the heated scuffles between Veracruz and Tigres fans that took place in the stands. On the ground, Gignac and Tigres manager Ricardo \"Tuca\" Ferretti were infuriated at what they perceived as the passivity of the police amid the chaos. Â¡Se volvieron locos! brutal golpiza a aficionados de Tigres, explota \"Tuca\" y Gignac con la policia de Veracruz @AztecaDeportes pic.twitter.com/C6p8m9XFbz \nVeracruz could receive a significant fine for proving incapable of keeping order at a sold-out event. \n5. Puebla gets vital win over struggling Chiapas \nChiapas' three wins this season have come against Tigres, Toluca and America. You would suspect these type of results to solidify the team's character as it goes head-to-head against direct relegation rivals, but this has not been the case. Three of Chiapas four losses have come against Morelia, Veracruz and Puebla. \nPuebla hadn't won a single Clausura game until Chiapas came to Estadio Cuauhtemoc. Coach Jose Saturnino Cardozo, who wore a cap throughout the whole game, left the pitch pleased after his team's 3-0 win. At the same time, Sergio Bueno looked down at the ground worried, knowing that his team had lost to three direct opponents in the relegation race. \nNayib Moran covers Liga MX and the Mexican national team for ESPN FC.
