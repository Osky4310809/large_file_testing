Keep in mind, more than two-thirds of communities in Colorado – the first state to legalize fully – voted to ban pot sales in their towns. \nAnother big issue – does the law allow for a black market that could override local control, make it much harder to keep pot away from minors, and cut into the tax revenues we’ll realize from legal pot? \nCurrent law lets you grow up to 12 pot plants per household, and one group calling for tighter control says that could yield up to 12,000 joints, raising the prospect of a situation where legal sales compete with a black market from home growing. \nAnd the biggest pending issue speaks to what this new law is all about – money. \nThe measure written by the pot industry and approved by voters sets a ridiculously low tax rate, well below what other states charge. We’re talking about a billion dollars or more in revenue each year from this, and if the state doesn’t get a fair cut of that, the damage of legalized pot might well outweigh the benefits. \nBetter buckle your seat belt. The road to fully legalized pot in Massachusetts is going to be a bumpy ride.
