Under the pretense of national security, it still targets immigrants and refugees,” said Hawaii Attorney General Douglas C. Chin, a Democrat. “It leaves the door open for even further restrictions.” Advertisement - story continues below \nNeal Katyal, an attorney working with the state, implied Trump’s words would be used against him, noting that in the first ban, Trump said announcing the ban in advance of its effective date would limit its effectiveness. \n“Of course, this time not only did he take a week but he took 10 days,” Katyal said. “So I really think it just underscores the lack of national security justification here — this isn’t about protecting us from bad guys rushing into the country, this is about politics.” \nAlan Dershowitz , a Harvard law professor emeritus, told Fox Business Network, however, that the new order may be hard to beat. \n“From a view of constitutionality, they have dotted their I’s, they crossed their T’s (and) they will probably prevail in court proceedings.” Advertisement - story continues below", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T18:06:56.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
