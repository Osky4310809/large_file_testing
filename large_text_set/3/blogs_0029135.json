It has over 30% share now. \n“Online and offline markets will contribute nearly equal shares to Xiaomi’s sales in China in a couple of years, a balance that the company may achieve in India over time. The short term goal in India would be to grab about 50% share of the burgeoning online market,” said Lei Jun. \nXiaomi said that it sold 4 million smartphones smartphones in India last year. This month the company said that it sold 1 million Redmi Note 4 smartphones in just 45 days of launch. It also recently said that it sold 250,000 units of the Redmi 4A in just 4 minutes in the first sale on Amazon.in last week. \nXiaomi at the Redmi 4A launch in India last week said that over 95% of its phones sold in India are made in India. The company also opened a second manufacturing plant in India recently in Sri City. Reason for ramping up manufacturing and opening the second plant is supply-demand mismatch, said the company. It will expand manufacturing in India to resolve issues around shortage of supply in the face of high local demand. It may even look at exports from India.
