GameStop says weak sales of certain blockbuster video games released during the critical holiday season and \"aggressive console promotions\" by other retailers contributed to the plunge. \nNew hardware sales declined 29%, while new software sales dropped nearly 20%. \n\"We encountered stiff headwinds as we completed the third year of the console cycle,\" said CEO Paul Raines. \nWhile growth in video games shrinks, GameStop says its Technology Brands business, which includes cell phone retailers like Spring Mobile, posted a 44% increase in sales during the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, its Collectibles business, which features the apparel retailer ThinkGeek, rose 28% due to strong interest in Pokemon toys and gear. \nThis year, GameStop says it will open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores, and will close between 2% to 3% of its GameStop stores, which amounts to at least 150 stores. \nLarry Perkins, CEO and co-founder of SierraConstellation Partners, says the gaming market is following the path of other specialty retailers in moving toward more diversified offerings. \"Not only are they getting hammered by the online retailers and big box that have an inherent cost advantage through no retail real-estate footprint or a much larger footprint that they can leverage with other products, but the movement to mobile-based games is creeping up mightily,\" he says. \nA potential bright spot for GameStop's gaming business is the launch of the Nintendo Switch earlier this month. Mizuho analyst San Q. Phan says GameStop has indicated \"its multiple replenishments since launch have sold out in hours.\" \nMeanwhile, Microsoft will introduce a new console later this holiday, dubbed Project Scorpio, an upgraded Xbox One which will support native 4K gaming and virtual reality. \nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .
