The current tuition is $5,472.\n“CSU is doing more with less,” said spokeswoman Toni Molle, adding that the additional dollars would be used to hire 400 new faculty, add 3,000 of the most highly demanded course sections and expand academic and student support services.\nAssemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva, D-Buena Park, with bipartisan support from seven fellow legislators, sent a letter Tuesday urging the CSU trustees to vote against the tuition increase.\n“It is my belief that funding our systems of higher education should not be done on the backs of students and their families,” Quirk-Silva wrote. “For this reason, we strongly oppose this tuition increase which would continue to put a burden on low-income and middle-class families.”\nWednesday’s vote comes before CSU receives its final budget from the state in July. The provisional budget indicates CSU will receive $157.2 million in additional revenue, but that would still leave a shortfall of $168 million, Molle said.\nCSU said in a statement that nearly 63 percent of California State University undergraduate students, or about 255,000 undergraduates, have their tuition fully covered by financial aid and would not be affected by the increase.\nMany students and several trustees have voiced concerns about a tuition increase, saying that tuition is only part of the expense of attending college, which costs thousands more after factoring in housing, books and living expenses.\nStudents, who protested outside the CSU Chancellor’s Office in Long Beach last November, gathered there again Wednesday, wearing signs that say, “Cause of Death DEBT ” and “Debt $50K.”\nCal State students say they can't afford a tuition increase or take on more debt. @CBSLA @KNX1070 pic.twitter.com/IX66LtJwzf \n— Jon Baird (@KNXBaird) March 22, 2017 \n\n\n(© Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
