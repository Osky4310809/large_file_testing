Seriously,” she said. “There was a progression of like, this size boob, this size boob and then, like, gigantic. I was like, ‘This is insanity.’ And different pregnancy pads, yes. I was most interested in the different-sized cutlets that I had to put on.”\nNBC Since the show takes place in both modern-day and back in the time throughout the Pearson children’s ’80s childhoods — and in the nine months leading up to their birth — Moore has already played everything from Rebecca’s delivery to the moment she first found out she was having triplets to, of course, the steamy conception. \n“All the shades of pregnancy — from it being fun to being miserable,” Moore continued. “Yeah, it was a lot of fun.”\nMoore, who hasn’t been pregnant in real life, also told reporters that in order to nail late-stage-pregnancy Rebecca, she focused on slowing down her breathing, adding that she would “imagine lugging around an extra 60, 70, maybe more pounds” to get each take just right.\nObviously she’s done a pretty great job, as her heavy breathing, her fake ta-tas, and so much more landed her a Golden Globe nomination just last month. And of course, just in case you happened to miss it, Moore officially has two years and 36 episodes more of facial prosthetics and cutlets to look forward to, as This Is Us just got a two-season renewal from NBC. \nAs expected, they were completely freaking adorable when they first found out.\nThis is Us getting the good news!!! #ThisIsUs pic.twitter.com/pOJpqvTbPH \n— Dan Fogelman (@Dan_Fogelman) January 19, 2017 THANK YOU ❤️ #ThisIsUs \nA video posted by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm) on Jan 18, 2017 at 2:51pm PST \nIs it too much to ask to be adopted into this family, ASAP?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:42:15.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
