On Thursday, Ian Rapoport of NFL.com reported the Bears are expected to sign the 2009 No. 5 overall pick. This comes after Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reported Tuesday Sanchez was planning to visit Chicago. Adam Schefter of ESPN confirmed the news and noted it will be a one-year deal. The Bears already signed Mike Glennon this offseason, so Sanchez will presumably be the backup. Sanchez threw just 18 pass attempts in 2016 as a member of the Dallas Cowboys , but he has appeared in 77 career games and adds more experience behind Glennon than Connor Shaw as a primary backup. Schefter noted that adding Sanchez makes it unlikely that the Bears will take a quarterback early in this year's draft: Adam Schefter @AdamSchefter Bears QB depth chart will be something like this: Mike Glennon, Mark Sanchez, David Fales, Connor Shaw. Hard to imagine them going QB early. 3/24/2017, 1:28:12 AM Sanchez has played for the Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles and New York Jets and has 86 touchdowns and 86 interceptions in his career. His most notable stretch came during the 2009 and 2010 seasons when he helped lead the Jets to the AFC Championship Game two years in a row. However, he had just 29 touchdowns and 33 interceptions during that span, so he wasn't exactly the primary reason New York enjoyed that success. As for the Bears, they are coming off an abysmal 3-13 season and haven't been to the playoffs since the 2010 campaign. Sanchez—who has never lived up to the No. 5 pick designation since he left USC—doesn't seem like the signing to turn things around in the immediate future, but he does provide experienced insurance should Glennon suffer an injury. That is something the Bears didn't have before this reported move.
