So don't be troubled or afraid.\" John 14:27 (NLT) Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. 2 Thessalonians 3:16 (ESV) \"I will lie down in peace and sleep, for you alone, O LORD, will keep me safe.\" Psalm 4:8 (NLT) You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.

I invite you to come into my turmoil and take these heavy burdens from me. I have reached the end of myself with nowhere else to turn. \nOne by one, I consider each burden now and lay them down at your feet. Please carry them for me so that I don't have to. Father, replace the weight of these burndens with your humble and gentle yoke so that I will find rest for my soul today. \nReading your Word brings so much comfort. As I focus on you and your truth , I receive your gift of peace for my mind and heart. This peace is a supernatural peace I cannot comprehend. Thank you that I can lie down tonight and sleep. I know that you, dear Lord, will keep me safe. I am not afraid because you are always with me. \nHoly Spirit, fill me to the depths with a heavenly calm. Flood my soul with your presence. Let me rest in knowing that you, God, are here and in control. No danger can touch me. There's nowhere I can go that you are not there already. Teach me how to trust in you completely. Father, keep me daily in your perfect peace . \nIn the name of Jesus I pray, \nAmen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:58:48.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
