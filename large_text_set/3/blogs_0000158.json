You do not just forget how to play football, it's like cycling. \n\"Mario's next challenge will be to find consistency. I have no doubts about it that he will bounce back. He has no reason to worry.\" \nWhile Klopp thinks Gotze is just an unlucky player whose career has been hampered by injuries, there are others who feel that the 62-time Germany international has not reached his potential. \nGotze's namesake, Mario Balotelli, also has the same Super Mario nickname and has seen his prodigious talent amount to nothing. \nIf the German cannot turn things around, he could end up like Balotelli, just with a better trophy cabinet. \nMichael Ballack is one pundit who has not been impressed by Gotze. The former Germany and Bayern midfielder can see his potential, but is annoyed that he never got to that level. \n\"When I see Mario Gotze, his development does not go in the right direction,\" Ballack told Sport Bild . \n\"He has outstanding qualities, but he has not reached his potential for whatever reason. \n\"His charisma is not so good, fellow players, coaches, fans and the media do not feel that he is fighting against his current situation. He's more an introvert player.\" \nWATCH: Oscar nets stunning team goal \nLow's Germany are set to face England on March 22, but Gotze will not be named in the squad due to his current absence. When he scored the winner in the World Cup final three years ago, nobody would have believed the way his career would turn out. \nBut at just 24 years of age, Gotze still has time to turn things around. A lot of people still believe in him. He has been backed by team-mates, coaches, even players who never worked with him. \n“Götze is the best German footballer,” Luis Figo told Bild . “He has such an incredible talent and can do everything with the ball.\" \nUnless he can get the help he needs to turn things around, Gotze will be little more than a faded footballer who never lived up to his talent.
