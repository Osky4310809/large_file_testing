Thus, Friday’s request to resign blindsided him. \nBy refusing to step down, Trump will be forced to fire him in a “public standoff,” CNN reports . \nThe move was applauded by Brian Kolb, the New York State Assembly's Republican leader, who tweeted, “Good for Preet, he is doing the job he was appointed to do!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T07:21:50.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
