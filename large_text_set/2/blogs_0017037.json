And then he up and went ahead and did it. Unfortunately, he only got Punk’s voicemail, but the moment was still amazing.\n. @TheRock leaves @CMPunk a voicemail! #WWE pic.twitter.com/twHtDFqC5z \n— NoDQ.com – WWE News (@nodqdotcom) February 21, 2017 \n\nSince Monday was National Love Your Pet Day (in addition to some other holiday), Punk’s excuse for not answering was pretty understandable.\nI'm walking Larry. It's his birthday.\n— Coach (@CMPunk) February 21, 2017 \n\nAs for the scene they were shooting, Paige was being played in the ring (as the stunt double) by wrestling legend Tully Blanchard’s daughter Tessa .\n. @teamTblanchard dressed as Paige for stunt work on #FightingWithMyFamily pic.twitter.com/bbm9ryO90l \n— ProWrestlingSheet (@WrestlingSheet) February 21, 2017 \n\nWhile AJ Lee was being played by Thea Trinidad in an outfit that in no way looked like AJ Lee.\n. @TheaTrinidadTMT as AJ Lee #FightingWithMyFamily pic.twitter.com/LxOQ6Ejmvo \n— ProWrestlingSheet (@WrestlingSheet) February 21, 2017 \n\nGuessing that there were some legal reasons for that outfit knowing the history between Punk, Lee and the WWE.\nAt least WWE still owns her music though…\nSo bizarre hearing this song play again at a WWE event as the actress playing AJ Lee comes out to the ring to film #FightingWithMyFamily ! pic.twitter.com/QU9CNfRo9d \n— Eric Goldman (@TheEricGoldman) February 21, 2017 \n\nCan’t wait to see in the movie how they somehow try to convince people that’s how AJ Lee actually dressed.\nH/T Uproxx \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:24:23.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
