So I’m guessing that doesn’t exist.” \nIn case Flynn was speaking to a foreign official — Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in this case — Nunes said there should have been a process to mask Flynn’s identity. \n“Unless it’s a high-level national security issue, and then someone would have to unmask the name, someone at the highest levels, they’d have to unmask that name,” Nunes said. “It’s a very high threshold to unmask an American citizen’s name, that’s a very high threshold, almost unprecedented. And if you were going to unmask it, it seems like you would immediately go get a warrant.” \n“If they did that, how does all that get out to the public which is another leak of classified information,” he added. “Whoever did it, it’s illegal.” \nThis was deep state sabotage . This is exactly what Chuck Schumer threatened would happen last month . \nThe deep state has come out of the shadows and is now openly working to sabotage our democratically elected president. \nThe New York Times just ran with another leak, which they suggestively titled “ Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence .” \nThe article contains nothing incriminating nor seemingly new, yet is titled and written in such a way to imply Trump and his entire staff are Russian agents. \nThe traitors controlling our alphabet agencies are openly staging a coup to overthrow our president and the Democratic party and entire leftist establishment is cheering them on. Gotta admire #TheResistance 's courage, defying Trump with no one on their side but the media, corporate world, DC, Hollywood, deep state… \n— J Burton (@JBurtonXP) February 15, 2017 \nIt’s hard to even believe they’re committing this treason so openly. The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017 \nWe desperately need to purge the criminals who’ve taken over these agencies. There’s no question they’re going to keep escalating the situation and I’d bet they’re currently plotting to assassinate Trump just like they did with JFK.
