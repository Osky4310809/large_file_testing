It cannot be business as usual.” \nHe added that Nigerians are entrepreneurial in nature, but needed to have the right infrastructure to unlock the potential that have been talked about for decades. \n“It is easy to see that we export timber, but import toothpicks simply because we do not have a steady and reliable supply of electricity to allow SMEs manufacture goods locally at competitive prices, thereby creating jobs for the growing unemployed population. \n“The population worries about tariff increases, but do not realize that they actually pay much higher tariffs by generating their own power with petrol or diesel powered generators,” he argued. \nOn renewable energy, he said that what Nigeria still needs are large baseload plants, with the capacity to generate from 100MW and above. \nAccording to him, renewables are essential to help preserve the environment, and sources such as hydro are definitely good to have in the power mix. \nHowever, he explained that currently available gas turbine technologies come with higher efficiencies, which make them a sustainable source of power without negatively impacting the environment. \nHe also stated that gas-fired gas turbine plants operating in open cycle or combined cycle mode are currently the best option for Nigeria to quickly boost its baseload power output to a reasonable number because they can be developed, built and commissioned in three to six years. \nIn addition, he explained that Century Power Limited, like the other organizations in the Obijackson Group, is keen on contributing to the development of Nigeria, stating that the country needs all the power it can get to pull it out of the doldrums of suppressed organic economic development. \nHe added that, “Much work needs to be done, and can only be achieved if the government sees private sector investors as the true catalysts for economic development that they are, and creates appropriate policies to aid sectoral development, as well as provides a favorable climate for such investments. \n“Without a robust power industry, providing a steady and reliable supply of power to the country, the much talked about potential of Nigeria will never be realized.” Tony", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T10:03:46.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
