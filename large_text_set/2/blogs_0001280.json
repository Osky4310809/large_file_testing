Michael Bennet says he will oppose Jeff Sessions’ nomination for AG \nMichael Hancock raised nearly $77,000 in contributions last year as he prepares a likely campaign for a third term as Denver mayor. \nThat’s still two years away. Hancock hasn’t yet reached the midpoint of his second term, and he wouldn’t stand for election again until May 2019 — if he makes his run official. \nA spokeswoman said this week that running again was “absolutely” his intention. \nHancock and his supporters put on a handful of smaller fundraisers in 2016 and solicited donations from his regular cast of donors — including developers, lobbyists and business leaders — who often wrote checks for $1,000 or $2,000. Only one donor, Walmart Stores Inc., gave the maximum $3,000 allowed for the entire 2019 election cycle under Denver’s contribution limits. \nAs of Dec. 31, Hancock’s campaign had $263,026.48 on hand after raising $76,950 during the year, according to a report filed Friday with the Denver Elections Division . The report includes itemized lists of contributions and expenses. \n“It’s not an astronomical number. I regard it as a keeping-oneself-in-the-game number,” political analyst Eric Sondermann said about Hancock’s 2016 donations. \nHancock started 2016 with just under $261,000, so the year’s fundraising to was designed more to maintain his war chest rather than grow it. The fundraising enabled the campaign to spend nearly $74,600 last year on consultants, events, fundraising costs and other expenses. \nHis campaign was able to conserve a healthy chunk of the $1.3 million he raised for the 2015 election because he faced an unfunded field of citizen challengers. He ended up winning with 80 percent of the vote. \nThat contrasts with the 2011 election, in which Hancock nearly depleted his cash on hand after a bruising run-off, requiring a fresh fundraising start for the next cycle. \nHancock spokeswoman Amber Miller said in e-mail: “Serving the city he loves in a job he loves is something Mayor Hancock looks forward to every day, and he’s humbled for the considerable support he’s received as we move Denver forward together. We have much more work ahead, and he is absolutely seeking a third term so we can continue to bring the city’s prosperity within reach of all of our people.” \nFor 2019, no potential challengers — among City Council members, business leaders and other possible contenders — have publicly stated an intention to run against Hancock. It’s likely still too early. \nBut Sondermann sees Hancock as more likely to face an aggressive, well-funded challenger next time. An opponent could try to tap into areas of brewing discontent over the pace of development, the resulting traffic and congestion, and the mayor’s projects and initiatives. \n“I think this will be a contested reelection,” Sondermann said. “Hancock would certainly be the favorite, probably a heavy favorite. … (But) there are people with ambitions who are tired of putting those ambitions on hold. And perhaps more importantly, there are movements festering within this city that are just waiting for somebody to give voice to them.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:43:01.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
