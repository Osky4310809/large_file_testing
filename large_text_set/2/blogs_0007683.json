Now, though, it's getting its just desserts and going on the road for a February British tour with the London Contemporary Orchestra. \nCheck out this 360-degree video of a recent rehearsal. \nGreenwood has collaborated with P.T. Anderson on each of the director's films since Blood. Greenwood has also scored several other films, including the adaptation of Haruki Murakami's best-selling novel Norwegian Wood , and has worked with luminaries of modern music like Krzysztof Penderecki, the Polish composer whose piece Polymorphia was famously featured in The Shining .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:43:16.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
