Would you be interested in 'sexual' stuff?\"\nPolice were first notified by the boy's father, who had been contacted by his son's girlfriend, the Oklahoman adds.\nThe son told his girlfriend that he was \"going to get paid tonight,\" which made her fear that he might be \"involved in illegal drugs.\" So she decided to follow him.\nAccording to what she told police, she witnessed a man get into her boyfriend's vehicle, and then she trailed them to the Super 8 Motel.\nWhen police arrived at the motel following the father's tip, the front desk manager told them that Shortey had rented the room for two adults. When Shortey was confronted by police at his room, he initially claimed to be alone, but eventually confessed that the teen was with him.\nPolice later discovered that the boy had a history of drug abuse, and had previously been involved in \"soliciting himself on Craigslist for sexual conduct.\"\nShortey potentially faces three charges: soliciting prostitution of a minor, prostitution within 1,000 feet of a church and transporting for the purpose of prostitution. Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn is awaiting the investigator's final report before pursuing criminal charges.\nOn March 15, Shortey was suspended by the state for disorderly behavior and has been stripped of his political privileges. \nIn a statement, Oklahoma GOP Chairperson Pam Pollard said: \"We condemn the actions of Senator Ralph Shortey to the strongest degree. While we believe in the right to a fair trial and that all people deserve their day in court, the accusations against Ralph Shortey are in no way in line with the principles of the Oklahoma Republican Party.\"\nShortey, a father of two was first elected in 2010, was a leader in President Donald Trump's primary campaign. After news of the incident became public, he deleted a picture of himself and Donald Trump Jr from his Facebook page.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T16:11:47.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
