If you ask us later on in life and we hadn’t won a trophy with the squad we have now, the players we’ve got and the basis we have to do that - if in five years’ time [that hadn’t happened] everyone would be disappointed. Spurs young side are eyed as one for the future - but Dier stresses the future is now (Photo: Reuters) \n“We’ve got to keep working hard and improving as there is still a lot we can work on before we reach that level, and the whole squad is desperate to win trophies. \n“Every game we play we want to win, no matter the competition or opponent, which means winning something at the end of it. That’s our aim no matter what team is out there. \n“We’ve got a very good squad, lots of very good young players as well, coming through the academy getting a chance and proving they deserve one. It only helps us we have competition for places and everyone is ready whenever needed.” Spurs are at the heart of the title picture (Photo: Richard Heathcote) \nTottenham are still in the FA Cup, the Europa League and are firmly in the Premier League title race. \nDier admits it will be difficult to keep fighting on three fronts but firmly believes they can end the wait for silverware this season. \nTottenham have not won the FA Cup since 1991, have lost six semi finals and won two League Cups since then but their aspirations are clearly higher this season and says Alli will be key to their success. Alli has been in outstanding recent form (Photo: Reuters) \nDier said: “It’s very difficult. FA Cup difficult, knockout, play lower-league teams with nothing to lose, they will throw everything at you and in a one-off game anything can happen. \n\"But that is our aim, to stay in every competition as long as possible and fight on all fronts. \n“Dele is scoring a lot of goals which has put him in the headlines but I’m not sure if it’s the best form he’s shown. Last season there were times when he was fantastic as well but he can do better as well. I’m sure he can.” Davies was the Spurs hero on Sunday, breaking down Aston Villa (Photo: Clive Rose) \nMeanwhile, Tottenham full back Ben Davies - given a rare chance in the FA Cup - is happy to stay and fight for his place against Danny Rose despite strong interest from Crystal Palace. \nDavies said: “There’s always going to be competition for places here and the standards have been set by all four of us, really (Rose, Walker, Trippier, Davies). \n“We’ve been playing well when we’ve had the chance. So when you get in the team, when you get that opportunity, you have to try to make a mark. \n“I like to think competition makes you better. When you’re competing with someone, you have that drive to do as well as possible. \n“I like to think it works both ways, that we’ve both improved in the time that we have been competing with each other to be as best as we can. You can see with Danny, some of his performances have been superb this year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:51:37.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
