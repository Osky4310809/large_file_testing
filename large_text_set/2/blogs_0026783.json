He was used sparingly by the Canadiens even after the recent coaching change from Michel Therrien to Claude Julien. \nDallas general manager Jim Nill calls Pateryn a solid defender with a physical presence who brings size and a right-handed shot. \nThe 29-year-old Benn has two goals and 13 assists in 58 games this season. He’s the brother of Stars captain Jamie Benn and is signed for two more seasons at a salary-cap hit of $1.1 million. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:25:12.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
