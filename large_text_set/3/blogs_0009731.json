(Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty   Terrelle Pryor signed a 1-year contract with the Washington Redskins Friday after leaving millions in guaranteed money on the table from the Browns. \nPryor leaves the Browns after 1 season that saw him lead the team in catches with 77 and receiving yardage with 1,007 yards. He also added 4 receiving touchdowns and another rushing. \nThe Browns offered Pryor a multi-year deal that was comparable to the 4-year, $32.5 million deal they signed veteran receiver Kenny Britt to on Thursday last week in Indianapolis, but it was turned down and ultimately cost Pryor millions in guaranteed money league sources told 92.3 The Fan. \n“[He] overestimated the market,” one source said. \nAs a result, Pryor gets a “prove it” deal with Washington that includes a $6 million base salary and $2 million in incentives. \nNo doubt that Pryor will be counted on to help replace the production lost with the free agent defections of receivers Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson on Thursday. \nBritt, who had 66 catches for 1,002 yards and 5 touchdowns last season for the Rams, isn’t coming to Cleveland looking to replace Pryor. \n“I’m not filling in anybody’s shoes,” Britt said Friday. “I have my own shoes to fill to tell you the truth and walk around in. Whatever he did here was on him, and good luck to his career and his success that he had here, but right now, it is moving forward.” \nAs for the Browns, they’ll move forward with Britt and continue with their plans this offseason to turn the franchise around by continuing to add to the roster through free agency and the draft.
