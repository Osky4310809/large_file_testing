This is Checks and Balances 101.” \nExperts say federal law authorizes the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation to examine individual tax returns. \nThe two other panels are headed by Senator Orrin Hatch , a Utah Republican who dismissed the idea of seeking Trump’s returns last week. \nHouse Republicans contend that the authority to examine tax returns was meant to ensure the proper administration of the tax code. Brady said his panel was doing just that in 2014, when it released confidential tax data during a probe of IRS treatment of conservative group applications for nonprofit status. \nPascrell’s letter said Trump’s business empire involves state-owned enterprises in China and the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Saudi Arabia. “It is imperative for the public to know and understand his…financial positions in domestic and foreign companies,” Pascrell wrote. \nBrady said the letter misrepresented the law’s intent to promote confidentiality and privacy. “I’ve read his letter and I disagree with all of it,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:40:05.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
