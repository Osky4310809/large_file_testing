CIA Director Downplays Chatter of Mass Resignations Under Trump 6:39  embed/853667907713\"   \n\"No CIA Director in history has ever been confirmed on Inauguration Day. The importance of the position of CIA Director, especially in these dangerous times, demands that the nomination be thoroughly vetted, questioned and debated,\" Senators Ron Wyden of Orgeon, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Patrick Leahy of Vermont said in a statement. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the Democrats are playing a dangerous game. \n\"It's critical for the president to have a full national security team today, day one,\" he said. \n\"Earlier today the director and deputy director of the CIA resigned. They left; they're gone. The director's job is open and unfilled. We need to confirm a new director today,\" McConnell added. \nDemocrats point out that a new President Barack Obama asked Preisdent Bush's CIA director to stay on until his nominee, Leon Panetta, was confirmed. \nBut Trump has made no such request and the CIA will be without a director at least until Monday. \nTrump will enter his first full day in the White House with fewer confirmed Cabinet secretaries than any incoming administration since George H.W. Bush's. \nIn a statement, Trump said he was \"pleased\" that Mattis and Kelly were confirmed. \nAnd he urged the Senate to move forward on the rest of his picks. \n\"I call on members of the Senate to fulfill their constitutional obligation and swiftly confirm the remainder of my highly qualified cabinet nominees, so that we can get to work on behalf of the American people without further delay,\" he said. \nDespite the pomp and circumstance and lawmakers' vocal celebration of a peaceful transition of power after one of the most divisive elections in modern history, the polarized electorate is representative of Washington.

Rob Carr / AFP - Getty Images \nAt a bipartisan luncheon after the inauguration honoring Trump, former presidents, former presidential candidates, former leaders of Congress and current members of Congress mingled at a carefully orchestrated seating at tables of eight made up of both Republicans and Democrats. About 200 attendees dined on lobster in saffron sauce and Angus steak with dark chocolate and juniper jus. The mood from the balcony seemed jovial, but tough conversations were had. \nA person familiar with the conversation said that Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who sat at the head table with Trump, told Trump that his cabinet nominees are too extreme. Schumer pointed to Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a tea party Republican nominated to be director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Rep. Tom Price to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. \nFormer presidential candidate Hillary Clinton attended the luncheon with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Upon entering, the former secretary of State was surrounded by a gaggle of people, both Republican and Democrat, wanting to shake her hand, give her a hug and take her picture. \nSen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, Clinton's challenger in the primary, waited in the periphery until he made his way to her. She shook his hand briefly and turned to his wife where she held her gaze for a few moments longer. Clinton then quickly moved on. \nTrump gave brief remarks at the end of the lunch that were much more unifying than what he said in his inaugural address. In the luncheon, Trump acknowledged, and even praised, Clinton, allowing the attendees of dignitaries give her a standing ovation.
