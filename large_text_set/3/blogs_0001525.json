Starc's double strike 1:43 \nIt hasn’t gone unnoticed, of course, that Starc’s Test average of 25.36 and top score of 99 are both superior to the team’s designated all-rounder Mitch Marsh, who averages 22.79 and has a career-best of 87. \nStarc is continuing a strong history of Australia fast bowlers excelling with the bat, but the most recent — and arguably most successful — of that lineage has urged selectors and fans alike not to burden Starc with an official all-rounder tag. \n“It would be unwise to lump that pressure onto Mitch — most importantly he’s there to bowl,” Mitchell Johnson, owner of a Test century, 11 50s and more than a handful of match-turning knocks. \n“All the tailenders work on their batting and it was something we’ve always been proud of in Australian cricket. \n“I know when I was playing it was something we worked on a lot. \n“But you can’t detract from what he is best at — bowling — and the team won’t put that pressure on him either. They just want him to play the way he does.” Mitchell Johnson admires a cracking cover drive. Source: Getty Images \nJohnson was regularly the subject of discussions about whether he could move up the order or take on a greater role as a batsman. \nIt’s not hard to understand why: when in the mood Johnson could swing for — and clear — the fences. \nAcross 73 Tests, he averaged 22 but hit his high point on Australia’s 2009 tour of South Africa when he hit an unbeaten 96 in the first Test — robbed of a century by a Ben Hilfenhaus golden duck — and backed it up with a majestic 123 not out off 103 balls in the third Test of that series. \nBut a funny thing happened whenever the debate filtered through to the excitement machine. \n“I suddenly thought I was a batsman first, bowler second,” he added. \n“It was really weird — every time that all-rounder tag came along, I was just like ‘oh yeah, I can bat a bit’ and I started trying to bat like a batsman and didn’t do too well.” \nAfter that breakthrough century, 12 of Johnson’s next 18 innings were in single figures — and included five ducks. \n“The role at no.8 is really important so first and foremost when I was playing I was a bowler. That was my job,” he said. \n“Any runs I could get on the board that was a bonus. \n“I didn’t put any pressure on myself, especially in the second part of my career. \n“I just went out there and played my natural game — didn’t put that pressure of being an all-rounder. \n“That’s where Mitchy needs to keep his head on and I’m sure he has. He just goes out, sees the ball and hits the ball.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
