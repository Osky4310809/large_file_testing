Penned by Pierre Havet, Jean Renard and Carl Sigman, \"Losing You\" is a heartbreaking ballad beautifully suited for Krauss' delicate, pristine vocals. Originally recorded by Brenda Lee for her 1963 album â€¦\"Let Me Sing\" , the bittersweet tune was a Top Ten pop and Adult Contemporary hit, also reaching the R&B charts and achieving success in the U.K. and Australia, making it Lee's most-charted record of all-time. Windy City features two tracks originally recorded by Lee: \"Losing You\" and \"All Alone Am I,\" a 1962 AC chart-topper. Related Alison Krauss on Nostalgic New Solo Album 'Windy City' First solo LP in 17 years finds the music icon covering country and bluegrass classics \nBluegrass, a genre for which Krauss is perhaps best known, is represented by the title cut and \"It's Goodbye and So Long to You,\" which Bobby and Sonny Osborne recorded in 1979 with another bluegrass icon, Mac Wiseman. Produced by Buddy Cannon, distinguished for his decades of production work with Kenny Chesney, among others, Windy City is Krauss' first solo LP since 1999's Forget About It . It's also her first apart from Union Station since 2007's multiple Grammy-winning Raising Sand with Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. \n\"Buddy's nickname in town is 'Ears,'\" Krauss tells Rolling Stone Country of her acclaimed producer. \"In a town full of people who are all so talented, he got the nickname 'Ears.' He has such an instinct for music and is so interested in the personality of the musicians in the room. Getting to work with him again made me so inspired.\" \nWindy City will be released February 17th. Pre-order of the LP is available now, with the deluxe version featuring live renditions of three of the album's tracks: \"Losing You,\"\"River in the Rain\" (by Roger Miller) and \"I Never Cared for You,\" written and originally recorded by Willie Nelson.
