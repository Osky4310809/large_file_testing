Both Sharjeel and Latif admitted to a breach of discipline, but vehemently denied spot-fixing charges. \nWhile Sharjeel and Latif were placed under immediate suspension, two other players, Irfan and Shahzaib Hasan, who were also linked to the mess, were allowed to continue playing in the league. The four Islamabad United players were accused of allegedly meeting the bookie soon after the season's opening game between Islamabad United and Peshawar Zalmi ended in Dubai, on February 9. \nIrfan met with the PCB authorities in Lahore on Monday wherein he's said to have admitted to have not reported meeting with the bookie during the second edition of the PSL. In unconfirmed reports, Irfan is said to have told that he was disturbed over the sudden passing of his parents last year and hence wasn't in a position to disclose the information to the higher authorities. \nLahore based newspaper 'The Dawn' has also reported that Irfan was asked to handover his mobile phone and other relevant information to the anti-corruption unit and has given him 14 days to respond to the suspension notice. \nThe fourth player, Shahzaib Hasan, is expected to appear before the unit on March 14. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T12:12:43.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
