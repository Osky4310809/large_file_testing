Check out the latest deals here . Monaco's most wanted men \nIt looks like it could be a long summer for Monaco. First Kylian Mbappe and Tiemoue Bakayoko have been linked with several sides across Europe, and now, according to the Mirror , Chelsea are lining up a £40 million double swoop for Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva . \nBoth 22 years old, Mendy, a left-back, and Silva, a midfielder, have caught Antonio Conte's eye as they have helped Monaco storm to the top of Ligue 1 and into the Champions League quarterfinals. \nIt is widely reported that Conte is keen to add depth to his Chelsea squad ahead of a return to European football next season, but Monaco will be keen to avoid too much upheaval. Iniesta snubs China interest \nAndres Iniesta rejected the opportunity to leave Barcelona and move to the Chinese Super League in a €35 million-a-year deal, according to AS . \nThe midfielder, who is contracted to Barca until 2018, turns 33 soon and despite being offered a two-year extension which would enable him to finish his career as a one-club man at Camp Nou, is said to be unsure because of reduced playing time this campaign. In addition, the Catalan club may ask him to take a pay cut in order to afford Lionel Messi's demands. \nHowever, the report adds that Iniesta's best chance of going to the 2018 World Cup with Spain is by staying at Barca, meaning Iniesta is likely to see out the remainder of his contract. Three clubs monitoring Roma's Manolas \nLiverpool want to strengthen their defence with the signing of Kostas Manolas , the Mirror claims, but if Roma decide to sell then Arsenal and Manchester United could firm up their long-standing interest. \nJurgen Klopp sent scouts to watch £35m-rated Manolas in Europa League action against Lyon this week and received a good report back, leading to speculation that he is readying a move for the 25-year-old. \nBut Arsenal, who saw a bid for Manolas rejected last summer, and United, who are also said to be monitoring proceedings, could make it a three-way battle for the Greece international who would stand to earn a big pay rise should he swap Serie A for the Premier League. STAR ON SUNDAY: Plane Crazy #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/rimjV40l4O - Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) March 18, 2017 Tap-ins \n- Manchester City have lined up Leonardo Bonucci as a £50m replacement for Vincent Kompany , according to the Star . \nThe Belgium international has started only five games under Pep Guardiola this season, and it's believed that he is considering his future at the Etihad . \n- Barcelona remain keen on Ousmane Dembele , despite missing out on the 19-year-old forward to Borussia Dortmund last summer. Mundo Deportivo reckons Dembele chose a move to the Bundesliga in order to gain more playing time but, having reportedly made contact again before Christmas, Barcelona will make another play to sign the France international next summer. \n- The Mail on Sunday claims Chelsea are ahead of Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain in the race to sign £50m-rated striker Romelu Lukaku this summer. \nBut Everton retain hope of convincing their top goal scorer to reverse his decision and remain at Goodison Park. It is said uncertainty around the future of Diego Costa is behind Chelsea's desire to land the Belgium international, whom they sold in 2014. \n- Arsenal and Manchester United both want to sign 14-year-old Leicester forward Terrell Pennant . The Mirror claims that Pennant, who has already trained with Leicester's first-team squad, will be available when his contract expires in the summer but Arsenal are trying to push a move through sooner after watching him in action on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T05:50:10.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
