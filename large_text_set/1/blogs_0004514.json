Something as simple as smiling at a stranger can make them feel good. The many stories of random acts of kindness go out to show how something that may amount to nothing to us, can mean the world to someone who is at the receiving end of it. But, it's not just the person who receives kindness who benefits from it. Acting kindly has numerous benefits too. Kindness releases dopamine , the hormone which is one of the happy hormones that our brain secretes. When people say that it makes them feel good to do something nice for another person, what they mean is that it makes them happy. This happiness feels kind of like a high, and for this reason it has been called 'Helper's High.' It doesn't stop here. Treating someone with kindness also releases oxytocin, which is the hormone responsible for building attachment. Recently, it has been discovered that oxytocin is also a cardio-protective hormone, which means that it protects our heart from diseases, and improves our overall cardiovascular health. Not only this, but being kind can also help a patient recover from cardiac issues faster. So, more kindness = lesser heart troubles. It is said that kindness and compassion help us stay younger, and live longer. Research suggests that there might be some truth to this. In a study conducted using Tibetan meditation for loving kindness, and compassion, the participants had lowered inflammation in the body, possibly due to how meditation impacts the vagus nerve. Inflammation is the root cause of many chronic illnesses. The study goes out to show that kindness can be a buffer against diseases. Kindness is contagious. It makes us feel good, and that's why we are drawn to it. We are all hard-wired to be kind to each other, but because of fear, or insecurities, or this illusory division of \"us\" and \"them,\" we forget to be kind to each other. But, if the habit is formed, it can be great for our health! Studies show that we are at our healthiest when we are kind. So, what holds us back?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:15:09.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
