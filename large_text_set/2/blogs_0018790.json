Vanessa Hudgens just donned a daring hair makeover , and if it isn’t a wig, it’s SO bold.\nIn Hollywood, you never really know if someone has actually changed their hair, or if it’s a fakeout, and this is definitely one of those times.\nOn Tuesday, Hudgens showed off a very different ‘do on Instagram, and we’re in love. We’re not one hundred percent sure that it is the real deal — it could easily be a wig — but we are major fans.\nIn the photo, the Grease Live! star has much shorter hair. In fact, it’s a totally unique and new style for the actress, who is known for switching up her ‘do.\nHudgens is rocking a short bob and blunt bangs, and it’s giving us major Chicago vibes.\n“Curious & curiouser,” the Powerless actress captioned the funky and fun photo.\nCurious & curiouser \nA post shared by Vanessa Hudgens (@vanessahudgens) on Feb 21, 2017 at 5:44pm PST \nCurious, indeed! Seriously, doesn’t she look like she should be on Broadway or dressed as a flapper?\nWe know that Hudgens can pull off any look, and this just proves it.\nmellow yellow \nA post shared by Vanessa Hudgens (@vanessahudgens) on Feb 20, 2017 at 1:53pm PST \nThe look above screams ’60s, while her new bang’d style is giving us a ’20s vibe. Usually, the 28-year-old actress opts for the hippie vibe, but this choice is still very retro and vintage, so it totally works with her #brand!\nWhat do you think about Vanessa’s new haircut? Is it is a wig or real?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:17:46.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
