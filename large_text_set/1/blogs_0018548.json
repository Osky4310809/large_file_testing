Bush ‘s 2001 inauguration. \nLewandowski insisted that Trump would not hold the boycott against any Democrat, because there will be times in the future when their districts will need help and he won’t tell these Democrats’ constituents they’ll suffer because of this decision by their elected representatives. \nYou can listen to the full interview above (the relevant discussion starts at the 8:15 mark), via The Takeout . \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T18:43:32.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
