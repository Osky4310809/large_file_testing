Any hopes of that were dispelled Thursday evening with a bombshell report in the New York Times.\n“American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of J. Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, current and former senior American officials said,” report the Times’ Michael S. Schmidt, Matthew Rosenberg, Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo.\nInaugural festivities — and just what Trump lays out in his address — will likely push the report to the background today. But one thing is clear: Russian interference in the election will continue to hang over the new administration.\nNOW WHAT? : “No one knows. Everything in Washington is a question — what kind of bills are going to come through Congress, how radically Republicanism and conservatism are going to be reshaped, what the Democratic Party is going to do in an attempt to be relevant again, how much is going to be dictated by the president’s mood on any given day, what would constitute everything going right, what will happen when something inevitably goes wrong, how much America is going to change with each day, with each minute. The clock’s going to tick over to 12:01, Donald Trump will be the president, and no one knows the answers,” writes POLITICO’s Isaac Dovere.\nWHO IS IN CHARGE? : The transition effort was lauded as a success by Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Thursday, but a slew of key senior positions remain unfilled. And with both Trump and Pence touting Monday as the real Day One of the new administration, some are left wondering who is minding the shop this weekend. Yours truly takes a look with Eli Stokols at an incomplete transition.\nHAPPENING TODAY: Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Five things to watch, from POLITICO’s Eli Stokols. And here’s a full schedule of events for the day and weekend, from the New York Times’ Nicholas Fandos. After a coffee and tea reception with the Obamas, Trump will give his inaugural address around noon with opening remarks by Sen. Roy Blunt and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Jackie Evancho will perform the National Anthem after the ceremony, and by 3 p.m. the parade will begin with the inaugural ball kicking off at 7 p.m.\nALSO HAPPENING TODAY: The Senate looks poised to confirm two of Trump’s Cabinet picks: James Mattis for secretary of Defense and John Kelly for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\nTRUMP TWEETS: The soon-to-be president fired off an optimistic message this morning: “It all begins today! I will see you at 11:00 A.M. for the swearing-in. THE MOVEMENT CONTINUES - THE WORK BEGINS!”\nCONFIRMATION PACE IRKS TRUMP’S TEAM: The incoming administration is growing increasingly frustrated that its Cabinet picks aren’t moving through the Senate more swiftly. Sean Spicer has lambasted Democrats for allegedly slow-walking the process, accusing them of putting politics ahead of the nation’s well-being. Incoming senior adviser Kellyanne Conway joined in the assault on Democrats Thursday, calling the confirmation hearings “show trials.”\nWE’RE STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS? : Trump enjoys regaling friends, donors and fans alike with tales of his victory, even as it fades — for some — in the rearview mirror. POLITICO’s Josh Dawsey on Trump and one of his favorite conversation topics.\nHAPPENINGS AT TRUMP HOTEL : The Washington Post’s Matea Gold and Jonathan O’Connell with a look at the scene at Trump’s D.C. Hotel , which got a big plug from Spicer on Thursday. On that note, the New York Times’ Eric Lipton and Susanne Craig on how the hotel is an ethical “minefield. ”\nWITH HIM FROM THE START : POLITICO’s Annie Karni on “the mean 15” — “a small group of loyalists … who were with Trump on the basement floor of his barebones campaign, enamored by the businessman from Day One.”\nCLASHES, AS EXPECTED: A combustible mix of fervent Trump fans and anti-Trump protesters met in D.C. Thursday night, and the results were nasty. The dispatch from the Washington Post’s Clarence Williams : “Anti-Trump protesters jeered and screamed at supporters of the president-elect who were attending the ‘DeploraBall’ at the National Press Club Thursday night, in one case throwing an object that struck a partygoer in the head. … Officers deployed chemical spray at the crowd around 9 p.m., after protesters began throwing trash at Trump supporters who were leaving the building.”\nTRUMP GREETS A FAN : A 24-year-old single father and security guard who volunteered on Trump’s campaign, and was profiled in the Washington Post, got the chance to meet the president-elect Thursday night — he left with photos, autographs, the promise of $10,000 and having enjoyed a presidential hug. The story from the Post’s Justin Jouvenal.\nIF IT RAINS TODAY : Rain is in the forecast today, and that’s okay with Trump. \"If it really pours tomorrow, that's OK, because people will realize it's my real hair,\" he told a candlelit dinner at Union Station Thursday night.\nEAST WING WATCH : From the Wall Street Journal’s Natalie Andrews: “Melania Trump, the incoming first lady, may turn out to be just as unorthodox in her new role as her husband is expected to be as president. For one thing, she isn’t likely to be in Washington with president-elect Donald Trump very much, at least initially. Mrs. Trump, who was rarely seen on the campaign trail, says she plans to stay in Manhattan with her son, 10-year-old Barron, who is in the middle of the school year in New York.”\nWHAT DEMOCRATS ARE DOING : POLITICO’s Heather Caygle on how Democrats who are boycotting the inauguration ceremonies are spending their day.", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/trump-supporters-opponents-clash-outside-national-press-club-downtown/2017/01/19/b2918bac-dead-11e6-918c-99ede3c8cafa_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_fstreetclosure930p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.ebacfc467cb2", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/this-is-the-greatest-guy-trump-meets-fedex-courier-offers-him-10000/2017/01/19/e227a8fc-de98-11e6-acdf-14da832ae861_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_take515p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.3021ae49b3db", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-washington-hotel-is-hub-of-inaugural-action--and-potential-conflicts/2017/01/19/df4f20a0-de85-11e6-918c-99ede3c8cafa_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_trumphotel650p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.934e90e068d1", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-long-distance-first-lady-1484843721?mod=e2twp", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/us/politics/trump-inauguration-schedule.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-international-hotel-ethics.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-abc-region&region=span-abc-region&WT.nav=span-abc-region&_r=0"], "published": "2017-01-20T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T15:46:02.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
