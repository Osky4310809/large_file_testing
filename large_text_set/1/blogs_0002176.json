their 100th birthday, the Football League put on a naff tournament that was unloved by fans and forgotten quickly by the winners   11.57   \nT here have been a number of awful football competitions organised throughout the history of the sport, from the Anglo-Scottish Cup to the Zenith Data Systems, taking in such delights as the Texaco Cup, ScreenSport Super Cup and Watney Cup along the way. Fortunately my club, Arsenal, have managed to steer clear of most of these, but in 1988 the club qualified for a cup competition that was organised by the Football League to commemorate their 100th anniversary. \nThe Football League were naturally eager to celebrate their 100th year as the 1987-88 campaign kicked off. In August 1987, a Football League Representative side defeated a World XI 3-0 at Wembley . Maradona was roundly booed every time he touched the ball, with the majority of the 61,000 crowd unable to forgive or forget his Hand of God goal from the previous summer. But this would not be the only chance to mark the Football League’s centenary. \nIn April 1988, a whole set of League fixtures were cancelled to allow the staging of the Mercantile Credit Football Festival, which turned out to be as naff as it sounded. Hosted at Wembley and contested by 16 teams that had qualified through a pre-defined set of matches, attendances were low; 41,500 on the Saturday and only 17,000 for the Sunday. Matches played between 40- and 60-minute periods resulted in nine of the 15 contests going to penalties, as the party fell flat in a big way. The Joy of Six: flawed sporting competitions Read more \nThe Football League were determined to stretch out their landmark anniversary, though and, as the 1988-89 season commenced, there was one final tournament to mark the occasion. The Mercantile Credit Centenary Trophy, involving the top eight Division One clubs from the previous season, would bring the curtain down on the underwhelming centenary celebrations. \nStuart Jones put it well in the Times when he described the Mercantile Credit Centenary Trophy as “the closing debacle of the embarrassing League centenary celebrations.” Arsenal went on to win the tournament, beating Liverpool and Manchester United along the way, but the fact that it isn’t listed on the club website honours page says a lot. \nArsenal’s first match in the eight-team tournament was away at Queens Park Rangers, who had finished fifth in the First Division in the 1987-88 season , making them London’s top club. Arsenal had just beaten Wimbledon 5-1 on the opening day of the campaign and came to Loftus Road – which had lost its skin-shredding artificial pitch in the summer – as favourites. QPR boss Jim Smith said it was good to be in the tournament but the “vast sea of upturned blue seats,” to quote Jones again, told a different story. Just 10,019 people attended the match, which Arsenal won 2-0 thanks to goals from Tony Adams and Brian Marwood. \nSquad rotation was still a distant concept back in 1988 and there was no European football to overload the players, so strong teams were fielded. Nevertheless, fans voted with their feet. Only 16,439 people watched Manchester United beat Everton in their quarter-final; only 17,141 went to St James’ Park for Newcastle’s 1-0 win over Wimbledon; and Liverpool could only bring in 20,141 for their 4-1 victory against Nottingham Forest. \nThe semi-final between Arsenal and Liverpool attracted the highest gate of the tournament, with 29,135 fans coming through the turnstiles at Highbury. In truth, Liverpool were massively weakened by injuries – Bruce Grobbelaar, Alan Hansen, John Aldridge, John Barnes, Steve McMahon, Jan Molby, Nigel Spackman and Barry Venison were all missing – but in a season when the two clubs battled it out for the league title , Arsenal took the opportunity to score the first blow. \nBoth Arsenal goals involved key components of the glorious season ahead. A near-post flick-on from a corner resulted in the opener for Perry Groves and a Marwood volley secured Arsenal’s place in the final. It may not have been the most significant Arsenal victory ever but any win over Liverpool was to be enjoyed in the 1980s. Great goalkeeping gaffes: from John Lukic to Erik Thorstvedt via Pat Jennings Read more \nManchester United beat Everton and Newcastle United en route to the final and, with their feisty FA Cup tie at Highbury earlier that year still in the memory, the contest developed into a committed and sometimes bruising affair. This was the case off the pitch too, with fans involved in a number of running battles in and around the stadium, as Andy Townsend might put it. \nUnited originally wanted the final played at either Highbury or Old Trafford, but Villa Park was chosen as the neutral venue. “The whole point is that William McGregor, of Villa, was the instigator of the Football League, which is the reason for the competition,” George Graham pointed out before the match. It wasn’t as if the stadium was ill-equipped to deal with the final; the match would be watched by just 22,182 spectators. \nWatching the highlights , it is impossible to ignore the empty terraces, although the atmosphere inside the ground still sounds better than any stadium you will visit in England now. Played in wet conditions, the match was ultimately settled by two contributions from Paul Davis. For a man who entered the match heavily under the media spotlight, the final proved a welcome positive. \nA few weeks before, Davis had been caught punching Southampton midfielder Glenn Cockerill squarely on the jaw , breaking it in the process, and earning a nine-match ban for his troubles. Davis signed off in style, though. He volleyed home a Marwood cross after 36 minutes to give Arsenal the lead and then, four minutes later, spotted Michael Thomas charging through the midfield and set him up for the second goal. Thomas’ goal may not have been as important as the one he scored on 26 May 1989 , but his flip celebration was a lot better on this wet Sunday in Birmingham. \nUnited had the better of the second half, Clayton Blackmore halving the deficit after 84 minutes , but Arsenal held on to win an exhilarating match. Tony Adams climbed up what looked like temporary scaffolding to lift the strange trophy and the players looked slightly embarrassed passing it around, but Steve Curry was spot-on in his assessment in the Express: “The League’s centenary celebrations have, overall, been a shambles, but this rousing finale at least left one worthwhile memory.” Michael Thomas and Paul Davis kiss the trophy. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images \nArsenal were awarded £50,000 in prize money but perhaps the biggest bonus was that it kept the winning habit going. “I know it’s been criticised. But if you’re going to enter a competition, win it,” said Graham firmly. Very true. Brian Clough said Nottingham Forest’s triumph in the Anglo-Scottish Cup in 1977 started something big at the club. The Mercantile Credit Centenary Trophy was not as important to Arsenal under Graham but winning the competition didn’t hurt. \nI’ve visited the Emirates for a couple of stadium tours in recent years and can’t recall seeing the Mercantile Credit Centenary Trophy in the trophy cabinet. Maybe I’ll take my son again and see if we can spot it. He’s bound to ask me a few questions about the competition and I can proudly say this is a trophy that cannot be taken from us. However, I might just be able to stop myself from singing: “We’ve won it one time, we’ve won it one time, the Mercantile Credit Centenary Trophy, we’ve won it one time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T14:17:23.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
