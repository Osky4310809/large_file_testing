By Heather Caplan Wednesday, March 1, 2017, 10:03 am Photograph courtesy of Starbucks \nWhen you’re pressed for time or on the road, fast food may not be your first choice, but sometimes it’s the only choice. While calorie counts are frequently available at most chain restaurants, they don’t tell the whole story, and in some cases, the lowest-calorie item isn’t your best bet because it’s missing runner-friendly vitamins and minerals. \n“I tell clients to look beyond total calories, and focus on protein and fiber, so they feel full and satisfied,” says Kim Hoban, a registered dietitian and runner. When that information isn’t readily available, look for items with animal or plant-based proteins such as meat or poultry, fish, or beans, legumes, cheese, yogurt, nuts, or tofu. And menu items that have whole grains, fruits, or vegetables will be higher in fiber. \nFat is also important for satiety — but you won’t struggle to find plenty of that in many fast-food menu items. The more important thing may be what type of fat they have. Kelly Jones, a certified specialist in sports dietetics (C.S.S.D.), cautions athletes to avoid items too high in saturated fats, especially for recovery meals. You’ll find the highest amounts of saturated fats in animal proteins (especially beef and dairy), fried foods, and desserts. This means skipping the chicken nuggets, burger patties, and dairy-heavy options like cream-based soups, quesadillas, or a side of sour cream. 1/8 Photograph courtesy of McDonald's McDonald’s: Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad, 320 Calories (Without Dressing) \nA hamburger may be McDonald’s lowest-calorie option (250 in a regular), but it’s missing a lot of nutrients. Order the 320-calorie Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad instead, because unlike the hamburger, it’s packed with nutrients. This salad piles on the protein with grilled chicken breast, corn, beans, and cheddar cheese. You also get a quarter of the recommended daily intake for dietary fiber (five grams), which helps with weight maintenance, and lowers risk of heart disease. The vitamin and mineral content is where the salad really shines: It provides 180 percent of your daily needs for vitamin A, 45 percent for vitamin C, and 20 percent for calcium. If you skip the cilantro lime dressing, you’ll avoid four grams of sugar and 250 mg of sodium. Ask for an extra lime, instead, and squeeze the juice over your salad to help draw out the flavors without adding calories. If you’re having this as a postrun meal, add a McDonald’s side of Cuties clementines (35 calories) or apple slices (15 calories) for few more carbohydrates. Nutrition Information 320 calories per serving, 37 g protein, 27 g carbs, 5 g fiber, 5 g sugar, 10 g fat, 4 g sat fat, 33 mg sodium 2/8 Photograph courtesy of Panera Panera: Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich (on Whole Wheat), 460 calories \nPanera may be home to a plethora of baked breads and pastries, but it’s also a soup, sandwich, and salad powerhouse. The lowest calorie menu item, the Low-Fat Garden Vegetable Soup, is a measly 110 calories. “This wouldn’t come close to satisfying a runner’s nutrition needs,” says registered dietitian Cara Harbstreet. Instead, order the 460-calorie Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich on Panera’s Whole Wheat bread. This sandwich, packed with cilantro-jalapeño hummus, feta cheese, vegetables, and whole grains, provides 18 grams of plant-based protein and six grams of fiber. It also has 70 grams of carbohydrates, and 50 percent of your daily needs for vitamins A and C. All good things for either refueling after a workout or a few hours before an evening run. Pair it with a fresh apple (80 calories) for added fiber and something sweet. Nutrition Information 460 calories per serving, 18 g protein, 70 g carbs, 6 g fiber, 9 g sugar, 12 g fat, 3 g sat fat, 1190 mg sodium 3/8 Photograph courtesy of Starbucks Starbucks (Breakfast): Spinach, Feta, and Cage-Free Egg Whites Wrap, 290 calories \nStarbucks could improve its breakfast selection by including the whole egg, not just the whites—yolks contain the egg’s vitamins A and D, half of the total protein, and choline, which is important for eye health. Instead of the low-calorie Sous Vide Egg Bites (170 calories), the wrap has a little more than double the calories plus nutrients, veggies, and flavor variety. The wrap has 45 percent of the recommended daily intake for vitamin A, and 15 percent of your calcium and iron needs. And thanks to its 33 grams of carbs, 19 grams of protein, and 10 grams of fat, it’ll help refuel your muscles after a morning run. Up the calories with a fresh banana (100 calories) or a couple handfuls of trail mix (215 calories) to round out the meal. Nutrition Information 290 calories per serving, 19 g protein, 33 g carbs, 6 g fiber, 4 g sugar, 10 g fat, 3.5 g sat fat, 830 mg sodium 4/8 Photograph courtesy of Starbucks Starbucks (Lunch): Hearty Veggie and Brown Rice Salad Bowl, 430 calories \nYou’d be hard-pressed to find a vegan fast-food option, but Starbucks offers an animal-free Hearty Veggie and Brown Rice Bowl. It stands out as one of Starbucks’ higher-calorie salads, with 430 calories (compared to the Zesty Chicken and Black Bean salad, with 360). This bowl is indeed hearty, with a mix of greens, beets, broccoli, butternut squash, peas, and roasted tomatoes. The vegetable medley is served on brown rice, which accounts for most of the bowl’s carbohydrates and dietary fiber, and some of the protein. All together, this bowl provides more than 100 percent of the daily recommended intake for vitamins A and C, and is a good source of both calcium and iron. For extra protein and unsaturated fats, ask for a package of chopped nuts (70 calories; they normally go with Starbucks’ Hearty Oatmeal). Nutrition Information 430 calories per serving, 10 g protein, 50 g carbs, 8 g fiber, 8 g sugar, 22 g fat, 3 g sat fat, 640 mg sodium 5/8 Photograph courtesy of Wendy's Wendy’s: Power Mediterranean Chicken Salad, 360 Calories (Without Dressing) \nLike the McDonald’s hamburger, you won’t get much besides fat and sodium from a Wendy’s Junior Hamburger (240 calories). For a more nutritious meal, order the Power Mediterranean Chicken Salad, a blend of hummus, quinoa, chicken, feta, and vegetables. Before dressing, this salad has 360 calories with a whopping 40 grams of protein, and 11 grams of fat, which will help you feel full. The suggested light vinaigrette dressing is worth skipping, with 10 grams of added sugar and more than 200 mg of sodium. Instead, mix the hummus around, and ask for a fresh lemon to squeeze on top. With or without dressing, this mix of vegetables, lean protein, and quinoa is an excellent source of vitamins A and C (120 percent and 90 percent of your needs, respectively), and a good source of calcium (20 percent) and iron (15 percent). Bonus points for introducing quinoa and hummus to Wendy’s traditionally meat-heavy menu. Nutrition Information (without dressing) 360 calories per serving, 40 g protein, 29 g carbs, 8 g fiber, 8 g sugar, 11 g fat, 3.5 g sat fat, 1070 mg sodium 6/8 Photograph courtesy of Subway Subway: Rotisserie Chicken Sandwich on 9-Grain Wheat, With Avocado, 400 calories \nSubway is one of the healthier fast-food options, with its spread of fresh vegetables, variety of dressings and condiments, and build-your-own-sandwich approach. But the chain’s salad options leave something to be desired and usually don’t meet a runner’s nutrition needs for protein, carbs, fat, or fiber. For example, the Turkey Breast Salad has just 210 calories (dressing included), half of which are fat. Instead, go for a full spread of nutrients with the Rotisserie Chicken Sandwich on 9-Grain Wheat. Order the six-inch and top with fresh avocado slices, and you’ll get 400 calories with 30 grams of protein, almost 50 grams of carbohydrates, and 11 grams of fat (a mix of saturated and unsaturated fats). You can add vitamins and minerals to the sandwich by piling on the extras, like tomatoes, green peppers, and spinach. Nutrition Information 400 calories per serving, 30 g protein, 47 g carbs, 7 g fiber, 7 g sugar, 11 g fat, 2 g sat fat, 540 mg sodium 7/8 Photograph courtesy of Tacobell Taco Bell: Power Menu Bowl, Vegetarian, 460 calories \nBelieve it or not, Taco Bell can be one of the better fast food options for vegetarians. Its website says the chain is the “first quick service restaurant to offer American Vegetarian Association (AVA) food options.” And on a rural highway, that’s a rare find. The bad news? Many of these low-calorie picks are just beans, cheese, and a corn or flour tortilla. Take the Spicy Tostada, for example: Only 210 calories with almost no micronutrients (less than 10 percent of the daily value for all vitamins and minerals listed). But the vegetarian Power Menu Bowl ups the ante with 460 calories and an impressive nutrient profile. It provides 16 grams of protein and 58 grams of carbohydrates (almost nailing that preferred 4:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio for post-workout recovery), and 13 grams of dietary fiber (50 percent of your daily needs). You’ll also satisfy your vitamin C needs for the day, and get 45 percent of the recommended intake for vitamin A, 20 percent for calcium, and 25 percent for iron. Plus: The combo of rice and beans provides a complete source of protein. Nutrition Information 460 calories per serving, 16 g protein, 58 g carbs, 13 g fiber, 3 g sugar, 19 g fat, 5 g sat fat, 1040 mg sodium 8/8 Heather Caplan Chipotle: Salad Bowl (Sofritas or Steak, Brown Rice, and Black Beans), 510 calories \nWith Chipotle’s mix-and-match menu options and DIY toppings, one meal could be anywhere from 200 to 1,000-plus calories. But you can land somewhere healthily in the middle. Start with a salad bowl, add brown rice and black beans, and either steak or sofritas (tofu). Add the fresh tomato or roasted chili-corn salsa, in lieu of the vinaigrette dressing, and you’ve got about 500 calories of nutrient-dense food. The sofritas are a great vegetarian option, and actually provide a little more calcium, iron, and vitamins A and C (compared to steak). The steak adds 13 more grams of protein compared to the sofritas and some variety to the usual chicken, turkey, burger, or bean options at other fast-food joints. By skipping the sour cream and cheese blends, you’ll avoid up to 10 grams of mostly saturated fat.
