That’s because it’s the fine-dining restaurant’s ninth annual, Kentucky Derby party, and, in FOMO news, it’s also the last. Along with the restaurant’s art, furniture, and more , out goes this annual tradition of getting drunk on mint juleps in your best Southern finery. For this final soiree, the crew has teamed up with Philadelphia’s Michael Solomonov (Zahav, Dizengoff), who, alongside chef Daniel Humm, will be offering variations of fried chicken from Federal Donuts . Also look for snow cones, a raw bar, and plenty of whiskey and bubbles. EMP mint juleps Eleven Madison Park “We started the party because as the restaurant was becoming more refined, we wanted to make sure we still had a chance to let loose. And we feel so grateful to all the people that came each year and went crazy cheering for a two minute race that most hardly understood,” owner Will Guidara told Eater. “May 6 will definitely be the end of an era.” Entertainment includes live music, a gif photo booth, and a best dressed competition. So if you want in on this guaranteed debauchery, $275 per person tickets are now on sale here , with a portion benefitting Saratoga WarHorse Foundation. There are a lot of changes going on in EMP world, besides the retiring of this party — though Guidara hinted it may be resurrected in different forms — including a major renovation (and therefore temporary closure) of the three-Michelin-star restaurant, as well as a Hamptons pop-up in the meantime .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:38:03.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
