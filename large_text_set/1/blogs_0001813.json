And now it seems clear that this was not just some holiday fluke but the beginning of a romance that will only continue to blossom in the new year, as evidenced by the fact that the couple absolutely went out of their way to spend New Year’s Eve together.\nWhich, in case anyone’s counting, that means the two artists most definitely were kissing, because that’s what one does at midnight on New Year’s. And not only did the pair spend the holiday together, but they took great pains to do so. Lopez was initially scheduled to appear in Miami for a performance she went on to cancel for “personal and family time.”\nBut next we knew she was in Vegas with Drizzy for his appearance at the Hakkasan night club. Which, tbf, that still kind of counts as personal and family time. 2017 is still very young, but DraLo seemed poised to be the internet’s favorite couple.\nFor more really entertaining celebrity news, look at how horribly Mariah Carey screwed up her New Year’s performance! Watch her go nuts right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T11:49:23.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
