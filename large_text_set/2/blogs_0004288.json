The plea deal requires that she undergo a psychological evaluation.\n“There wasn’t a lot of proof,” defense attorney Scott Lewis said of the allegations.\nNoonan reportedly went with the 13-year-old into his bedroom, where she got undressed and climbed into bed. Her attorney, Kirk Anderson, said that she knew the boy through his mother.\nShe told the boy to keep their sexual relations a secret, but he told his siblings they had intercourse. The soccer coach was charged in July 2015 after the boy’s siblings told police about their tryst, according to CBS .\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:57:34.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
