And we're starting to see it...You look at the wall...you look at the immigration banâ€”everything seems rushed.\"\nRelated: Mark Cuban: Through the years \n\nHe later added, in part , \"The question is, what is his approach...what is his management style...Just tweeting is not communicating.\"\nCuban also said , \"I think that communication is the biggest issue right now. Look, we all want to be safe. Tell us why this is going to make us safer. Don't just give us headlines.\"\nSEE ALSO: Trump launches into morning tweetstorm defending immigration order \nThese comments add to a series of tweets Cuban posted over the weekend where he raised concerns about the disruptions Trump's sudden executive order caused companies, families, and authorities.\nHowever, Trump has defended the lack of warning, tweeting Monday morning, \"If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad 'dudes' out there!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T11:06:29.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
