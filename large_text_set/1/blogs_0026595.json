By Matt Apuzzo and Eric Lichtblau New York Times January 30, 2017 — 6:12pm Zach Gibson, New York Times Sally Yates, who is now the acting attorney general, speaks during a news conference at the Department of Justice in Washington, June 28, 2016. Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, ordered the Justice Department on Monday not to defend President Trump’s executive order on immigration in court. Purchase: Order Reprint WASHINGTON – Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, ordered the Justice Department on Monday not to defend President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration in court. “I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,” Yates wrote in a letter to Justice Department lawyers. “At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful.” The decision is largely symbolic — Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is likely to be confirmed soon — but it highlights the deep divide at the Justice Department and elsewhere in the government over Trump’s order. Trump has the authority to fire Yates but, as the top Senate-confirmed official at the Justice Department, she is the only one authorized to sign foreign surveillance warrants, an essential function at the department. “For as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so,” she wrote. She was expected to inform the White House of her decision early Monday evening. There was no immediate response from the White House. But Trump is certain to react strongly to the open defiance to his authority. Yates’ letter transforms the confirmation of Sessions as attorney general into a referendum on the immigration order. Action in the Senate could come as early as Tuesday. The decision by the acting attorney general is a remarkable rebuke by a government official to a sitting president that recalls the dramatic “Saturday Night Massacre” in 1973, when President Richard Nixon fired his attorney general and deputy attorney general for refusing to dismiss the special prosecutor in the Watergate case. That case prompted a constitutional crisis that ended when Robert Bork, the solicitor general, acceded to Nixon’s order and fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor. Yates, a career prosecutor, is different because she is a holdover from President Barack Obama’s administration, where she served as deputy attorney general. She agreed to Trump’s request to stay on as acting attorney general until Sessions is confirmed. Several federal judges blocked part of the Trump’s executive order over the weekend after lawyers representing some of those detained at the airports quickly filed lawsuits. The judges ordered the government not to send detained people back to their home countries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:16:19.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
