Anti-Trump activists designed cardboard boxes highlighting issues they want the future first daughter and her father to address when she moves to Washington D.C., the Daily Mail reported.\nDozens of protesters were seen carrying boxes that urged Ivanka to not forget about civil rights, Planned Parenthood, climate change, abortion rights, nuclear regulations, freedom of speech, etc. One sign even read: \"Dear Ivanka, please don't forget to pack human decency.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIvanka, who was on a night out with her husband, Jared Kushner, appeared unbothered by the demonstrations. She posted a photo to her Instagram account, captioning it: \"Bright lights, big city #datenight.\"\nThe demonstrations were organized by the Halt Action Group. They called for protesters to gather with boxes that contained messages for President-elect Donald Trump and his family.\n\"The boxes represent freedoms that people are fearful of losing,\" the group said in a press release.\n\nIvanka will soon be moving to Washington D.C. with her husband and children. Kushner will be taking a senior advisor position in the White House alongside Donald Trump.\n\"My husband, Jared, and I will be moving with our family to Washington, DC, where Jared will serve as Senior Advisor to the President,\" Ivanka Trump explained in a Facebook post. \"I plan to take time to settle our three young children into their new home and schools.\n\"I'm grateful for the overwhelming amount of outreach I've received from people all across America who have shared their stories and offered to extend their ideas and expertise in the areas I am deeply passionate about, including the education and empowerment of women and girls; leveling the playing field for female entrepreneurs and job creators and unleashing the potential of women in the workplace.\n\"I am eager to hear more from them as I determine the most impactful and appropriate ways for me to serve our country.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T17:42:01.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
