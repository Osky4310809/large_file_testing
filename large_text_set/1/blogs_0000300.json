Glenelg earned two of them and entered the final match of the night at 132 pounds — a match-up of two of the state’s best in Glenelg sophomore Jared Thomas and Oakland Mills junior Kyle Farace — up by 11 with the dual meet already clinched. \nThe win keeps Glenelg tied atop the county with undefeated Mt. Hebron. \n“I thought we wrestled well. I would have liked to see us persevere, but we got challenged and we had a couple guys who were out of our lineup tonight,” said Oakland Mills coach Brad Howell. “So we had to try and look at it and try to persevere with what we’ve got; let’s go make it happen. I thought we had a couple opportunities to hold off some [pins] that could have made the difference in the match. We won all the matches we were eyeing to win. \n“We won where we were supposed to and they got their forfeits. We just had to go after not giving up a couple of bonus points, and they had an edge there.” \nBichner pointed at a pair of early matches that, even though the Scorpions won both, the Gladiators benefited from. Ben Goldfein (138 pounds) and defending county and regional champion Johnny Rynn (145) won via major decision to give Oakland Mills an early 8-0 lead, but Bichner said just not giving up pins there were key, especially with the heart of Glenelg’s lineup being between 152 and 195 pounds. \nThe Gladiators reeled off three straight wins from returning county finalists Jacob Jones (152, pin) and Max Sotka (160, decision), and county champion Garrett Murray (170, pin) to take a 15-8 lead, one they wouldn’t relinquish. \nA forfeit to Sam Alsheimer (195) after Oakland Mills’ Paul Johnson won a tightly contested decision at 182 pounds extended the lead to 10, but the Scorpions made it a one-point dual meet with a 1-0 decision and pin from Aaron Smith (220) and Khalil Abdul-Malik (285), respectively. \nA team-by-team breakdown of what to expect from the 2016-17 Howard County wrestling season.

The Glenelg sophomore that competed at 113 for the first month of the season dominated Oakland Mills freshman Jalen Cornelius at 106 pounds in a 12-0 major decision victory. \n“Kevin’s been doing really well,” Bichner said. “He’s finally down at weight and I think he’s going to do big things at 106 pounds. He’s wrestled some of the top guys in the state down at 106 and he’s battled them tough.” \nThe trio of forfeits followed, as Logan Gwin (113) and Tino Campanile (126) had their hand’s raised for Glenelg and last year’s state finalist Daiquan Anderson (120) had his go up for the Scorpions. Campanile’s forfeit gave the Gladiators an insurmountable 11-point advantage when Thomas and Farace stepped onto the mat in the most anticipated showdown of the evening. \nThomas, who won the 126-pound title at the Damascus Holiday Tournament Dec. 28, started the match with a takedown but Farace answered with a reversal and two near-fall points to take a 4-2 edge into the second period. Howell thought Farace may have secured the fall in the scramble, though Bichner thought the points were awarded too quickly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T06:05:50.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
