In an announcement about the new season, Bravo executive vice president Shari Levine remarks: “We are always on the hunt for the next great culinary destination and Colorado is fast becoming a hot spot for young chefs and foodies, making it an ideal backdrop for our upcoming season.” This is the first time the program has filmed an entire season in the Centennial State. The show will be shot in Denver, Boulder and Telluride this year. No word yet on whether one of the challenges will involve cooking with legal marijuana, but that sounds like good, or at least somewhat amusing, television. The show has fallen into a steady rhythm over the years, and some mild psychoactive drugs might be just the thing Top Chef needs to shake things up a bit. Bravo has not released any information about who will be competing this season, but expect a few details to leak before the to-be-announced premiere date at the end of 2017. Top Chef wrapped up its 14th season earlier this month, with LA chef Brooke Williamson taking home the gold . Stay tuned for more details (and casting rumors) as they become available, and if you hear any hot gossip about who’s competing, please let us know via the totally anonymous Eater tipline .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:42:56.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
