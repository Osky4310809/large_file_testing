These last few years, I accepted the fact that we were never going to find him. In my heart I had put him to rest.\"\nThe Sorry writer was also shocked to find him in California, considering it was across the country from their childhood home in New York:\n\"Los Angeles has a population of nearly 10 million people. How is it that he was sitting alone at a bus stop less than a few miles from my home? Also we are all from New York, so it is a surprise to find him here.\"\nThe \"Becky with the good hair\" lyricist recalled that David didn't recognize her when she approached him, and realized he had developed mental health issues, adding: \n\"As I continued to talk to him, I quickly realized my brother who had once built computers and gadgets out of spare parts has suffered severely in ways I have only begun to understand. His memory is fragmented. His spirit defeated. He has only had his own thoughts to comfort him during this long stretch of time and because of that, a form of mental illness has set in.\"\nDavid is the oldest of Diana's five siblings, and would earn money for their family by helping out at the supermarket, even before he was old enough to actually get a job.\nMiz Gordon contacted her family to share the good news, and even convinced her brother to stay at her home:\n\"After showing him some old photographs of us in my phone and FaceTiming my sisters in New York, I convinced him to come back with me to my house with the promise of a warm bed and food. He was hesitant, thinking it was a trick. He is not used to any sort of kindness.\"\nAfter calling hospitals, counselors, and social workers, Diana learned what needs to be done to give her sibling the help he needs, and has turned to the crowdfunding site to raise money for medical care, psychiatric help, and assisted living.\nYou can see a sweet snap she posted of their incredible reunion (below):\n\nShe even threw him a birthday party a few days later!\nWe're so glad these two were reunited!\n[ Images via GoFundMe , Diana Gordon/ Instagram . ] \nTags: amazing , beyonce , brother , charity , crazzzzy , diana gordon , family , gofundme , heartwarming , homeless , lemonade , los angeles , mental health , music minute , new york , sorry , viral: news", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T02:29:56.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
