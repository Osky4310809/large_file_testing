Shares \nAs part of Humble Bundle's monthly subscription service, you can get XCOM 2 today for $12 . You'll have until February 3rd to grab it, along with all the other mystery games that will be revealed once the entire bundle is released. It's still a bit of a gamble, but even if the other games don't float your boat, a 100 percent chance to grab one of the best strategy games released last year for a fraction of its normal price are pretty great odds. \nOn Steam, XCOM 2 is currently listed at its usual $60 price, so if you've been on the fence, now might be the best time to give it a shot. It means signing up for Humble Bundle's subscription service, but you don't have to commit to anything more than single month since you can cancel at any time. Personally, I've kept a subscription since the service launched. Even if every month isn't a banger, for $12, I almost always get a few games I'd never played before, and on occasion, there's a big surprise game nested inside a la XCOM 2. \nIf you do commit, be sure to check out our guides for decking out soldier s and getting your base up to a professional commander's standards . Once you're feeling cozy, check out our selection of the best XCOM 2 mods and get to saving the world exactly how you want to. \nSome online stores give us a small cut if you buy something through one of our links.
