The North obviously has no interest in America’s well-being; however, it is eager to turn the gun back on the “aggressors,” as it often refers to the U.S. \n“The U.S. is the worst-ever tundra of human rights in the world and the ringleader and the mastermind of human rights violations,” the Rodong Sinmun argued in a separate article. “Wherever the U.S. sets its bloody foot in, there follow endless streams of blood of humankind.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:24:43.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
