This is officially a full-on Twitter war.\nA pre-existing feud between former NBA star Shaquille O'Neill and Golden State Warriors center JaVale McGee flared up again late Thursday night with a series of hot tweets, the content of which included violent threats, nut emoji and not-so-savory photoshopped images.\nSEE ALSO: In pep talk fail, Jameis Winston tells elementary school girls they're 'supposed to be silent'\nFirst, some context.\nShaq â€” an analyst on TNT's Inside the NBA â€” hosts a segment called \"Shaqtin' a Fool,\" which essentially exists to troll NBA players. McGee â€” who has found new life with the Warriors this season â€” has long been known as a walking lowlight reel, with a wealth of missed free throws, botched dunks and just general clumsiness to his name. He's a consistent target of Shaq's segment but isn't too happy about it.\nMcGee threw some shade at the segment in October, and the two had a minor exchange on Twitter in January, but things really went south this week.\nAfter the Warriors' 123-113 win over the Clippers on Thursday, Shaq aired a hilarious Dr. Strange parody â€” featuring all of McGee's worst gaffes â€” to troll Golden State's center once again.\nDoctor Strange JaVale McGee #DubNation pic.twitter.com/L55So9WDcZ\nâ€” CandidSkeptic (@candid_skeptic) February 24, 2017\nMcGee had enough.

And EAD! #thatisall\nâ€” Javale McGee (@JaValeMcGee34) February 24, 2017\nIf you're curious what EAD means, might we suggest the Urban Dictionary definition. It was enough to really rile up Shaq, who took things in a violent direction.\n@JaValeMcGee34 don't be acting like u a g I'll smack the s**t out yo bum ass u da one that be looking stupid with your dumb ass #bumass\nâ€” SHAQ (@SHAQ) February 24, 2017\n@JaValeMcGee34 now since you on a good team u wanna act like you a player now stop it u will only be remembered for shaqtin a fool #bumass\nâ€” SHAQ (@SHAQ) February 24, 2017\nMcGee's frequent burn for Shaq is his age. He resorted to that one again.\nForget being on a good team...
