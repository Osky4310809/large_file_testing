Their source indicated user growth slowed in the second half of 2016. That could in part be due to the rise of Snapchat Stories clone Instagram Stories, which we reported this week has been stealing Snapchat usage, according to analytics providers and social media talent managers. \nRevenue looked brighter, reaching $400 million in 2016, which is in line with what analysts had estimated and was reportedly higher than the $350 million high-bar set by Snap’s team internally. That shows Snap is finding ways to squeeze a lot of money out of its relatively small user base, thanks to highly engaging sponsored animated selfie lenses and full-screen snap ads. \nSnapchat isn’t trying to sell the story of scale with a flashy monthly user count, since people who only open the app once a month aren’t very monetizable. Instead it’s touting its high time-spent per user and average revenue per user, which The Information pegs a $2.70 per user. It’s also relying on strong initial international growth in Western Europe and Australia to show it still has plenty of users to add. \nLater today we’ll hopefully be back with the official S-1 IPO filing with much more detail on Snap’s progress as the camera company prepare to become a public company. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T20:38:14.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
