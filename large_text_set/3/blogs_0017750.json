Hmm... 1. Should I let my dog lick my face? Wash your hands after petting (Photo: Getty) \nAs much as we love a good snuggle with our pooches, we know our four-legged friends aren’t the cleanest of things. \n\"There’s a big difference between letting a dog lick your face and letting it lick your mouth,\" says Dr Christian. \"Remember that dogs do eat and lick things that aren’t so clean.\" \nIf you’re prone to illness or have a weakened immune system, then avoid letting dogs lick your face and always wash your hands after petting. \n\"But you don’t need to be too obsessed,\" adds Dr Christian. \"Sterilising everything has given us a generation of sickly kids.\" 2. After a certain age should we worry about having vigorous sex in case we pull a muscle, break a hip or have a heart attack? \nWe’ve all seen those movies where the overweight business man has a heart attack mid-thrust. \n\"This is a myth – the amount of strenuous activity we undergo during sex is not that great,\" says Dr Christian. \"Plus, you can pull a muscle lifting a bag, so it shouldn’t stop you having wild and enjoyable sex. We don’t talk about sex in a positive light enough – it’s good for you, so go for it!\" 3. Does cracking your knuckles give you arthritis ? It might be more annoying to other people than your health (Photo: Getty) \nIt’s an annoying habit that 54% of people are guilty of, while the rest of us flinch. \n\"It’s a myth that it gives you arthritis ,\" says Dr Christian. \"The clicking is caused by small bubbles of gas in the synovial fluid being released, and it doesn’t cause damage to the cartilage. But it is likely to irritate your neighbours!\" 4. Is eating pudding really that bad for my health? \n\"Dessert is concentrated calories with not a lot of additional nutritional benefit,\" says Dr Christian. \"But denying yourself something you really like is likely to start a destructive and negative cycle.\" \nRather than kissing goodbye to pud altogether, take a look at your overall calorie intake and how much you exercise. \n\"The myth that sugar feeds cancer is completely untrue – it’s a gross misunderstanding of biology,\" adds Dr Christian. \"It leads to weight gain, which in turn increases your risk of cancer, but sugar itself is not the culprit.\" 5. How can you tell if you’ve got bad breath? Have a check-up with your dentist (Photo: Getty) \n\"The best way to tell is by asking someone who’s close to you, who you know will give you an honest answer,\" says Dr Christian. \"If you’re worrying about smelly breath, you’ve probably got legitimate concerns.\" \nThere are a couple of tricks you can try: lick the inside of your wrist, let it dry for a second and then smell it. You can also try flossing the teeth towards the back of your mouth and sniffing the floss. If it smells bad, your breath will smell the same. \n\"Halitosis can be caused by some more serious health conditions,\" adds Dr Christian. \"A dentist is a good first port of call, but you could also talk to a doctor, as it could be pointing to a bacterial infection, a liver condition, or diabetes.\" 6. Should I squeeze the huge spot on my face? \nWe all know you’re not supposed to squeeze your spots, but if you have a massive pus-filled one on your face it can be hard to avoid the temptation to squeeze. \n\"It’s fine to squeeze a spot, as it will never heal while it still has pus in,\" says Dr Christian. \"Gently and cleanly pop it when it’s ready, with a piece of tissue – but don’t go digging away at it with tweezers, as you’ll risk scarring.\" 7. I have a problem with BO, is it better not to shave my armpits? Shaving too much could be adding to the problem (Photo: Rex Features) \nArmpit hair is there to wick away moisture and help it evaporate, but it also traps smell and pheromones to help you attract a partner. \n\"It’s not so much shaving your armpits but the over-washing that can be a problem,\" explains Dr Christian. \"It’s the constant stripping of the skin’s protective layer that tends to worsen the problem. The smell is caused by bacteria feeding on the sweat and breaking it down into odoriferous compounds.\" \nTry shaving your armpits and using an antibacterial deodorant, and reduce the amount you sweat by wearing natural fibres. 8. Sex is painful – is it because of the menopause? \nYour levels of oestrogen drop during the menopause, and this can cause the delicate tissue in your vagina to shrink. \n\"If it is because of the menopause, oestrogen cream applied locally can be very effective and you may have to start using lubricant,\" says Dr Christian, \"but don’t assume it’s tied into the Change. There are lots of other causes of painful sex, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, skin complaints, or infection – so if in doubt, get it checked out.\" 9. Should you pluck mole hair? Just be wary of any changes in moles (Photo: Getty) \n\"If you don’t like it, get rid of it,\" says Dr Christian. \"Moles have the potential to change, but plucking the hairs won’t cause this. Look out for it getting lighter, darker, bigger or smaller, itchy, crusty or raised.\" \nIf you have a mole that you’re worried about, take regular, well-lit photos of it, with a ruler for perspective. You can keep track of changes and show your GP.  10. Should I clean my ears out? \nWe’ve all heard horror stories of eardrums being burst by cotton buds, but it can be hard to resist the urge to give your plugs a good clean out. \n\"Don’t do it!\" says Dr Christian. \"Everything works its way out eventually, cotton buds act like a plunger and ram everything in. Wipe your ears with a flannel in the shower, or use olive oil drops to shift impacted wax.\" Dr Christian Will See You Now, starts Monday 20 March, 9pm on W Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T09:09:11.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
