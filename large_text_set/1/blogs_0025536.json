Reality is less fun though, because the clouds that are rolling over the wings of the airplane are caused by the lift forces that let our planes fly. Advertisement \nFlugsnug , the guy who took the video of all the takeoffs and landings with clouds forming around the wings, says: \nThese are a by-product of the lift forces which hold aircraft up in the sky. Lift comes about because the air pressure is low above the wing, and a drop in air pressure (and temperature) tends to cause invisible water vapor (gas) to condense into the visible water droplets (liquid) we see as clouds. \nMy theory on the wing clouds would be cooler, I think.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T03:07:08.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
