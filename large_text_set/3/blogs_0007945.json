Miss you!\nOn Tuesday, Hillary Clinton received the Champion for Girls Award from Girls Inc. (because of course she did!) — and she accepted the honor by saying that although she's experienced some \"set backs\" (*cries*), she's hopeful about the future of women in politics.\nRelated: Trump Surprises White House Tour Group — Right In Front Of Hillary Portrait! \nThe first woman to win the presidential nomination of one of America's two major political parties said:\n\"Let us hope there is a wave of young women running for office in America, and let's be sure we support them in every way we can. Let's help them shatter stereotypes and lift each other up. They are the history-makers, the glass-ceiling breakers of tomorrow. They are among the reasons I am so optimistic about our future. Women are both smart enough and good enough to be considered for anything they choose to pursue. … We have to teach every girl that she is valuable, powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity to pursue and achieve her own dreams. If we are serious about building a better, stronger and fairer America, we need to be serious about supporting and nurturing our girls. Our country can only fulfill its potential when every single child — particularly, every girl — can fulfill hers.\"\nYasss!!\nObviously, losing the election to Donald Trump wasn't the outcome the longtime public servant wanted — but she's spent her time since the election doing a lot of \"soul searching\" and, yes, taking \"long walks in the woods\"… and now it seems she's ready to get back in action: \n\"The truth is, life hands all of us setbacks. I've had my ups and my downs. In the last months, I've done my share of sleeping, a little soul searching and reflecting, long walks in the woods. In those moments, I am thankful for my own village, my community of family and friends who have supported and encouraged me.\"\nShe continued:\n\"‘It's OK to be OK sometimes.' Everybody gets knocked down. What matters is that you get back up and keep going. Practice the discipline of gratitude. It is easy to be grateful when things are going our way. But to exercise the mental discipline to be grateful in the face of setbacks, I have found, is one of the great experiences that give you that resilience and opportunity to see your life, to see your community in the world much more broadly, and to keep going. The inner strength, even the stubbornness, to keep showing up every day, to refuse to quit or give up in the face of any setback.\"\nRelated: A Sad Timeline Of Trump's First Month In Office \nBefore leaving the stage, she said:\n\"We have to keep fighting. We have to remain stubborn. We have to look for ways to mentor and support. And we have to understand that despite setbacks and stumbles on our long march to full equality, everywhere I look, there are signs of hope.\"\nConsidering this acceptance speech is the most inspirational thing we've heard from a politician in a while… we highly encourage you to listen to the full address (below)!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:55:15.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
