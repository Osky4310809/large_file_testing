The rectangle shape and modest size not only encourage a baby to remain on his or her back, the limited size prevents the child from flipping over on its stomach, which reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. According to the Center for Disease Control, there were 3,700 cases of SIDS in 2015.

Los Angeles-based organization called Baby Box Inc recently announced a partnership with local hospitals to provide free boxes for families, which include bedding and other basic supplies.\n\nOther states, including Ohio and New Jersey, are also testing a similar program, according to NBC News.

Frilly bedding is also an added hazard for potential SIDS cases.\nFor more on baby boxes and national programs, check out the Baby Box Company’s site . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T05:25:26.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
