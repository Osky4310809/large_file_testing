Her language was sl ghtly more colorful than that, but it got me thinking: why reserve that instant gratification for physical goods? Why not push a button and do some real good?\"\nSo, Pryor set out to build one.\nWith no donation API from the ACLU to work with, his wrote one that could automatically pull up the ACLU's donation form and instantly enter his personal information and credit card number.\nAfter a successful test-run on Amazon's website, Pryor linked his script to an AWS IoT Button , an Amazon Dash Button that's completely customizable. He even designed and printed a slick ACLU label to make it look more like a traditional branded button.\nAnd guess what? It totally works. Now Pryor keeps the button by his laptop for whenever he feels like the ACLU could use a little extra help.\nFor those looking to hack their own Dash Buttons, Pryor included his script (though he makes no promises as to its effectiveness or security).\nYou were planning to donate more to charity anyway, right?\nBONUS: This device can make any pair of headphones wireless", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Vqw2ZFrs.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Vqw2ZFrs.m3u8", "https://medium.com/@nathanpryor/the-aclu-dash-button-16719e446363#.t2jy3e93z"], "published": "2017-02-08T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:08:20.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
