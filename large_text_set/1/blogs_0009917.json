Klopp takes his side to Old Trafford on Sunday (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nIt’s over 16 years now since former United captain Roy Keane delivered his infamous “Prawn sandwich” tirade towards the corporate clients within their stadium, but Mourinho feeling compelled to gee up Old Trafford’s rank and file supporters ahead of such a powderkeg fixture against their greatest rivals represents a whole different ball game. \nWith increased demands of dealing with agents, sponsors and media, the remit of high-profile Premier League managers is continuing to expand. yet having to resort to such remarks in a post-match briefing for the Hull game had an air of desperation about it. \nWhat next, Jose donning full Toni Braxton cheerleader costume and whipping the Stretford End into a frenzy with his pom poms? \nAs someone who has felt the full force of the Anfield crowd when it comes to big games, Mourinho knows how crucial a partisan and vociferous home support can be on such occasions. \nAnd that’s where a crucial difference between Liverpool and United seems to lie. View gallery \nNo top-flight English side seems to be immune from the problem of sterile atmospheres for run of the mill matches. Anfield is no different in this respect. \nIn his time at the club so far, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp has already gone on record on more than one occasion when it comes to trying to cajole certain elements of the stadium into being more proactive. \nBut you can guarantee whenever Liverpool’s players need them, and certainly each time Manchester United are in town, the Kop and company are guaranteed to deliver. \nThe task this weekend from Klopp’s troops will be to ensure the Old Trafford patrons remain silent. \nIf they accomplish that for 90 minutes, you might just be able to hear the cheers from back on Merseyside. poll loading Who will win Sunday's clash at Old Trafford? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T18:59:25.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
