\n\n\nstudio job: building a brand is like building an autonomous identity. all aspects of the field are triggered… I mean we work in architecture, design, art, music and TV…. we developed several identities for other brands. why not start our own fun brand? \n\nDB: why did you choose the name ‘blow’ for the design collaboration with seletti? \n\n\nSJ: the word blow carries many connotations… blow your mind, blow up, blow job… it made us laugh really! \nhot dog, BLOW neon wall lights \n\n\nDB: your work is full of iconography — what were the industries or motifs that influenced the ‘blow’ collection the most? \n\n\nSJ : blow is a pop-brand. fast creativity… fast action… fast communication. fresh, young and fun. it feels like like street art or the ready to wear label of an exclusive haute couture fashion house… \n\n\nDB: sense of humor is a large part of your work, transmitting a feeling that you have fun while you create. can you guide us through your creative processes? \n\n\nSJ: how do you approach art and design projects that vary greatly in terms of scale and function? in the end its all the same….you analyse and react in the best possible way giving the circumstances. \nsausage department, BLOW rugs \n\n\nDB: why do think it’s important that design remains affordable and accessible to a wider audience? \n\nSJ: to me its all about the speed and the atmosphere… \n\n\nDB: what do you think are the similarities between your own practice and the seletti philosophy? \n\n\nSJ: we are both fast thinkers and dare to take steps…also when they are not obvious. stefano seletti’s mind works as the mind of an artist. that’s what we need in design! we don’t need another established brand with boring pre-fab targets… there are enough of those around. \nthe hamburger armchair, fast food furniture collection: the open hot dog bun is the actual structure of the sofa and it hosts an upholstered sausage \n\nDB: in your opinion, what is the current state of design? \n\n\nSJ : since few years I see a renaissance in italian design. an innovative approach that to me could become as important as the invention of post modernism and memphis back in the seventies and eighties. but this time it’s the open approach that makes it so energetic. brands like gufram, seletti, toiletpaper, design pride and blow are all artistic driven initiatives carried by innovative brains with an unconventional approach. there is no concurrence. there is no commercially driven structure or boring formalities…all friendship based, open minds working together sending good vibes into the air. it’s about the product, yes, but its even more about being part of the artistic magic. its about freedom….. \ntiffany tree lamp and banana lamp, UN_LIMITED EDITIONS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:59:02.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
