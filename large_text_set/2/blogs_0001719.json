He dissented in a decision that removed roadside crosses from rights of way, and when the 10th Circuit voted not to rehear a case removing a Ten Commandments monument from a county courthouse in Oklahoma. Gorsuch advocated removing the “reasonable observer” test, used to determine whether religious displays appear to involve government endorsement of religion. \nCommenting on the nominee, FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor said : \nIn short, Gorsuch is no friend to the separation of state and church. \nIn the Hobby Lobby case Gorsuch argued that corporations can have religious beliefs, and thus corporate management should have a say over what kin d of contraception, if any, employees may purchase with company insurance. \nIn addition to the Hobby Lobby decision, Gorsuch has indirectly indicated that he would oppose abortion rights for women. Think Progress comments on a 2009 book entitled The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia , Gorsuch wrote: \n(The book) is heavy with the kind of political rhetoric opponents of abortion deploy in the battle over reproductive choice. “Human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable,” Gorsuch wrote in his book, adding that “the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.” \nAs Ed Whelan, a former law clerk to Justice Scalia who writes frequently on the courts puts it, “ Gee, might that principle have any application to abortion? ” \nDiscussing Gorsuch’s legal approach to cases involving religion, SCOTUS Blog notes that the judge provides conservative Christians with “a sense that the government can permit public displays of religion – and can accommodate deeply held religious views…” \nFollowing the announcement of Gorsuch’s nomination to the court, Amanda Knief, American Atheists’ national legal director, released a statement noting that “Americans deserve better than a judge who would prioritize the ‘religious beliefs’ of a corporation over the right of a woman to make healthcare decisions for herself and the bigotry of some over the fundamental human rights of vulnerable communities.” \nThe following is an excerpt from that statement : \nAmerican Atheists has grave concerns about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve a lifetime appointment on the United States Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch’s expansionist view of religion as a ‘Get Out of the Law, Free’ card is fundamentally at odds with the history of American jurisprudence and would allow religion to be used as a weapon against women, LGBT people, atheists, and others. \nI strongly urge members of the United States Senate to fulfill their Constitutional obligation to look deeply at Judge Gorsuch’s record and determine whether or not his views about religious liberty are in line our American values. \nHaving examined his record myself, it is clear to me that Americans deserve better than a judge who would prioritize the ‘religious beliefs’ of a corporation over the right of a woman to make healthcare decisions for herself and the bigotry of some over the fundamental human rights of vulnerable communities. \nKnief is right – Americans deserve better. \nAs for the process, it looks to be a long road to confirmation for Gorsuch. Democrats are promising to filibuster the nominee because Republicans refused to hold a vote on President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. For example, an animated Senator Jeff Merkley told Politico : \nThis is a stolen seat. This is the first time a Senate majority has stolen a seat. We will use every lever in our power to stop this. \nBottom line: As a Supreme Court Justice, Gorsuch would threaten the separation of state and church, and the cherished secular values upon which this nation was founded. \nWatch: Trump Announces Neil Gorsuch as Supreme Court Nominee Trump Announces Neil Gorsuch as Supreme Court Nominee (Image via Screen Grab) Stay in touch with Progressive Secular Humanist on Facebook:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:52:00.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
