Former Knicks forward Charles Oakley was spotted shouting at Knicks owner James Dolan before he started shoving members of the responsive security team. Keep in mind that Oak is 6’8” and weighed a rock-solid 225 pounds while he was one of the NBA’s premiere enforcers, backing up guys like Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing during his playing days.

Last night, people tangled with Charles Oakley. \nOakley was eventually escorted from his seat by—no joke—seven men, but his temper stayed hot all the way to the tunnel, where members of the New York Police Department took him to the ground and handcuffed him , according to the New York Daily News . Oakley was charged with three accounts of misdemeanor assault and one of criminal trespassing. He was released from the Midtown precinct around midnight.
