Instead, the internet is ablaze after Trigga’s interview with The Breakfast Club . \nThe conversation includes Trey’s history with Drake, who brought him out at a recent stop on his Boy Meets World Tour . The two have a long history together, going back a decade to 2007’s “Replacement Girl” and Trey recalls his early support for the Toronto star. \n“Drake wanted to sign to me at a time when I wasn’t even Trey Songz yet,” he says. “We had arguments about Drake like, ‘You can’t sign to me.’ At that time, I felt like me and my label weren’t even in a good place whereas though they fully believe in my potential. I took Drake to many executives and a lot of people said no. I had to fight to get ‘Replacement Girl’ on BET 106 & Park . So just to see him become what he is is dope. It’s probably just reassuring that I believed in something that much.” \nHe says he knew Drizzy was destined to be something two years before So Far Gone and Trey was still living with his manager trying to figure out his own career. He says he and Drake will always be good friends and have hit the studio recently, but have some things to catch up on personally. \n“We just friends, so it’s things that we haven’t talked about that we should as men talk about versus we just been going our own way staying out of each other’s way,” he says. “It’s never no bad blood. He’s never spoke down upon me or I’ve never spoke down upon him, but it’s obvious you see we haven’t made music.” \nIn regards to Nicki Minaj, the claims from Remy Ma on “SHETHER” that he had sex with her were nothing new. \n“Everything’s alleged with me, baby,” he says, before proclaiming that Nicki hasn’t apologized to him for lashing out at him on Twitter for not addressing the situation how she wanted. \n“Nicki said she gave me a six-pack, but let’s keep it real, Nicki had shit before ‘Bottoms Up.’ She had the song with Sean Garrett,” he says. \nThat song, “Massive Attack,” is referred to by Charlamagne as “Anxiety Attack” and everyone shares a good laugh before Trey continues to make his case for why he skyrocketed Nicki’s career out of Lil Wayne’s shadow. \nReleased in 2010, “Bottoms Up” is Trey’s highest-charting song on the Hot 100 list, peaking at #6 and is certified four-times platinum. \n“After that, she did ‘Monster’ and then (slaps his hands upward) we could say that,” he explains. “All before it was like, look she’s hanging with Wayne. Who’s the wild girl with the wild hair? I love you, Nicki. I love you. You came at me wrong. You disrespected me. But I love you.” \nHe says the situation was extra frustrating because he says Nicki’s initial reactions to “SHETHER” were misdirected and points out that she took a week to put out “No Frauds,” her response to Remy. \n“Definitely need to be mad at Remy,” he says. “You gonna be petty, I’m gonna be petty, too. You ain’t said nothing to Remy. It still took you a week to say something to Remy.” \nTrey then explains why he thought he did the right thing in clearing the air on Instagram by saying he never had sex with Nicki Minaj. \n“I went out my way to say I didn’t and I don’t do that,” he says. “I just had a conversation up here with y’all about that two weeks before this happened that I don’t feel a need to say nothing about a woman to promote my career whether I’ve been with her or not and I don’t feel the need to denounce things when people say they are true. But because this was Nicki and because we do have a history, because I respect her, I went out my way to do that. What that got me?” \nHe had even more rumors swirling around him after the incident when he met up with Nicki’s ex Meek Mill and posed for a pic with the MMG rapper. Then, he ran into The Game (one of Meek Mill’s rivals ) in the club. \n“Trey ain’t got no loyalty to anybody,” Angela Yee jokes. \n“I just think it’s crazy that people have all these beefs and nobody doing nothing,” the singer says, sharing some words of wisdom, “Live your life for you.” \nTwitter clearly didn’t get to that part of the interview and quickly offered their commentary on Trey’s claims that he put Nicki on. trey songz is trending and it's not because of his new album that dropped today lol \nSeveral laughed at the thought that the leading lady of the Hot 100 chart needed Trigga to be successful. I want whatever Trey Songz was smoking when he did that interview. He basically said he put Nicki Minaj on", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T05:28:13.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
