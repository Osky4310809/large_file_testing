Governor Obaseki, I am told, is saying he has to be left alone to frame his own style and calibre of people he would conveniently UNDERSTAND and UTILISE to run his government, not spoilt hangers-on who had a field day during the past administration. \nThere is of course abundant evidence to prove that this cabal did gain a lot in the past. If I was in their its shoes, I would have taken a step backward to munch what I was able to gain in the past and allow Obaseki shape his own specific style without being forced to inherit hunt dogs from the past who had never in the real sense of it hunted in the bush. Obaseki’s kinsmen must demonstrate an acceptable aporeciative attitude to the Almighty God in producing one of their own to lead, not by asking for what they generally don’t merit in the state. \nThis clique or cabal can be sober and let there be peace in the state for the good of all citizens so as not to create a situation that would compel others to form a BRIGADE OF GUARDS, not only to protect the Governor and government, but also their votes that numerically framed his success at the election. Comrade Adams Oshiomhole was a very diplomatic and productive Chief Executive who had that style of keeping the cat andmouse around without any of them knowing, he did utilize them to enhance his style of governance. \nAny upright Edo citizen trying to paint Oshiomhole in a different coat of negative governance, must get his or her head re-examined as majority of right thinking Edolites are of the view that Oshiomhole was too kind, considerate and he indeed enhanced some paupers who now want to turn the heat on Obaseki because he is quoted to have said his administration would not be “business as usual”. \nGovernor Obaseki, from all indications, means business for the good of all Edo people, but the signals from some of his people, who ordinarily are actually not woth the salt, are the ones blowing hot. \nTheir ELDERS should sound a note of warning to them to please let their son get along with the state assignment given to him. In African traditional setting, there are moments when the BAD BOYS ARE USEFUL, but not within, as they are always needed to scare away INVADERS, not brothers. \nGovernor Obaseki is quite set to improve the project he began with Oshiomhole. So, one is tempted to ask, why this in-house cabal? \nI hope the Edo State Government is not benn pushed to the extent of identifying idle lazy ingrates as well as as enemies of the state in general. No issue is too complexed for ELDERS to handle. Governor Obaseki’s kinsmen should report themselves to ELDERS repenting, so that this ugly plan to hinder his administration would be nibbed in the bud because other senatorial districts in Edo state also have a stake in Obaseki’s success . \n*Mr. AUsman Abudah, a journalist and founder of Afenmai Heritage & Cultural Studies, wrote from Benin City, Edo State. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:00:54.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
