Among the organization’s many heartwarming rescues, you may remember the story of Rhea , an elephant who lived in chains for 53 years before Wildlife SOS saved her. While many of the sanctuary’s residents have come from horrific backgrounds, they are all able to find peace in the care of these amazing people. \nAnd we have yet another rescue story from Wildlife SOS to share with you today! Recently, a female sloth bear and her ten week old cub were electrocuted on the outskirts of the Sanjay-Dubri Tiger Reserve, located in Sidhi district of Madhya Pradesh. Miraculously, the baby bear survived the shock and was heartbreakingly found clutching his dying mother while nursing from her. \nBut thanks to Wildlife SOS, the baby bear was transferred to the Agra Bear Rescue Facility, which is a specialized medical and cub weaning facility. Expert veterinarians will be able to help the orphaned cub overcome his trauma and will go on to grow into a healthy, happy bear. Even though the above video is only 16 seconds long, it is sure to be the sweetest 16 seconds you’ll have today. \nSadly, sloth bears have remained under their “ vulnerable ” IUCN status since 1990. Many of them were kidnapped from the wild over the years to become “ dancing bears ” in India. Thankfully, this cruel tradition ended in 2009 with India’s last dancing bears retired to sanctuaries. However, other threats still loom for sloth bears. Their habitat has become increasingly threatened because of the over-harvesting of forest products, expansion of human settlements, and the establishment of monoculture agricultural activities. The bears are also poached for their parts and fat, which are used to in folk medicines and to ward off evil spirits. \nIf you would like to help Wildlife SOS continue their life-saving efforts, you can donate via their website . Together, we can make a difference in the lives of these amazing animals. \nLead Image Source: Wildlife SOS /Facebook   some recent posts below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:08:38.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
