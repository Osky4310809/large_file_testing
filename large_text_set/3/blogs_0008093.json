Despite claiming that Tyrone Mings “jumped into his elbow”, Zlatan Ibrahimovic has accepted the FA’s charge of violent conduct and will thus miss three games with immediate effect. That includes Monday’s showdown at Stamford Bridge, in the FA Cup quarterfinal between Chelsea and Manchester United. Zlatan: \"You have the TV, you can see the images. I jump up and jump high and Mings jumps into my elbow.\" #MUFC . Ahhaah — Philip Neville (@fizzer18) March 4, 2017 The charge was accepted without an appeal. Zlatan Ibrahimovic will serve a three-match suspension with immediate effect after he admitted an FA charge of violent conduct and accepted the standard penalty. Meanwhile, AFC Bournemouth are appealing the stamping charge with which Tyrone Mings was hit. Presumably, they will be claiming that it was accidental as the defender tried to jump over the prone Ibrahimovic who had fallen over his own teammate. BREAKING: Sky Sources: @afcbournemouth to appeal @FA charge of violent conduct against Tyrone Mings. #SSNHQ — Sky Sports News HQ (@SkySportsNewsHQ) March 7, 2017 For Jose Mourinho’s men, the ban means that one (or two of) Wayne Rooney, Marcus Rashford, and Anthony Martial will play at striker on Monday against Chelsea. We can only hope it’s Rooney, as the two young kids might actually pose some danger.
