Rosie O’Donnell wants to come on the show and do an impression of Steve Bannon First, Saturday Night Live gave us the hilarious Alec Baldwin as President Donald Trump. Then, Kate McKinnon began killing it as White House Counselor KellyAnne Conway. And just this weekend, we had the amazing Melissa McCarthy as White House Press Secretary (and gum enthusiast) Sean Spicer. And now? Get this. Rosie tweeted that she’d play Steve Bannon on SNL . WHA . Here’s what happened.\nIn response to the news that Melissa McCarthy’s Sean Spicer impression hit a nerve with the Trump camp, Parks and Recreation veteran Nick Offerman tweeted “Ok so please do Bannon next? Fish in a barrel, Lorne”.\nOk so please do Bannon next?\nFish in a barrel, Lorne. https://t.co/rSmTc4zSZ4 \n— Nick Offerman (@Nick_Offerman) February 7, 2017 Some random human chimed in suggesting that the legendary Rosie O’Donnell (who also, we should add, has a longtime feud with Trump) should play Trump’s controversial Chief Strategist Bannon. According to this Politico article, the president is more upset that Spicer was played by a woman than by the skit’s assertion that his press secretary makes up facts.\n@JohnFugelsang @Nick_Offerman Someone suggested @Rosie play Bannon on #SNL & I am here for it!\n— sarah (@sarahhyland87) February 7, 2017 And lo and behold Rosie responded. She says, “available – if called i will serve !!!”\navailable - if called i will serve !!! https://t.co/LT84EJjfsw \n— ROSIE (@Rosie) February 7, 2017 Oh, my god.\nThen, she added: “ @ calvininsf – i am here to serve – alec has trump – melissa has spice – i would need a few days to prepare – so if called – i will be ready.”\n@calvininsf - i am here to serve - alec has trump - melissa has spice - i would need a few days to prepare - so if called - i will be ready\n— ROSIE (@Rosie) February 7, 2017 A .\nRosie has had a very public feud with Trump . He called Rosie a “fat pig” during one of the Republican debates and later defended his name-calling in a 2016 debate against Hillary Clinton. “I said very tough things to her,” Trump explained, “and I think everyone would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.” O’Donnell once said in an interview with People that her worst experiences with bullying involve Trump.\nAt any rate, people are digging the idea of O’Donnell as Bannon.\nHey @nbcsnl : @thismyshow has a GENIUS idea: @Rosie as Bannon! Pleeeease make this happen.\n— comedyfilmguy (@comedyfilmguy) February 7, 2017 @comedyfilmguy @nbcsnl @thismyshow @Rosie Rosie has now tweeted that she's game... Please oh please\n— SaraSuze (@tragedythyme) February 7, 2017 @Mattlan12 @calvininsf she could save this country. Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country @Rosie ! pic.twitter.com/jxE67pY2Uz \n— Crooked Butters 2.0 (@ButtersV2) February 7, 2017 But, Rosie was clear on Twitter that, for now, this is just a fun rumor. In response to a fan who said, “The fact that there is a pretty good chance that Rosie O’Donnell is playing Steve Bannon on SNL makes me so happy,” Rosie responded:\n“no – that’s an alternate fact – someone tweeted it as an idea – after Melissa was so brilliant…just a funny idea # truth “ @2020fight - no - that's an alternate fact - someone tweeted it as an idea - after Melissa was so brilliant ... just a funny idea #truth \n— ROSIE (@Rosie) February 7, 2017 Your move, Lorne.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:56:25.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
