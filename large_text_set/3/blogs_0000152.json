And then all of a sudden all the smoke alarms went off, and I went outside my back, and stuff was coming off the roof. It was the insulation,” Kimball said. \n“We just got out, we automatically got out. We smelled smoke. You couldn’t stay in, because the noise from the smoke alarms. They all went off the 12 units.

It looked like he had done a nice job with the airplane and I said ‘Yeah, I think it’s ready,” Di Meo told WBZ. \n“He was a level headed guy. He was soft spoken, just an all around nice guy, courteous, willing to help anyone out, really nice guy,” Di Meo added. \nIn 1999 a plane with four people on board lost power after takeoff and crashed in the same apartment complex. The plane came to a rest against the building and no one was seriously injured. \nCheck back with CBSBoston.com for more details on this breaking news story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:51:32.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
