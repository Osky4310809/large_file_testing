But it was the first one he’s held in the province of Quebec.\nHe held another town hall Tuesday morning in the officially bilingual province of New Brunswick but no one at that Fredericton town hall put any questions to him in French.\nHe did get a French-language question at a town hall last week in Peterborough, Ont. and, there, chose to respond in English.\nThe tradition on Parliament Hill or in press conferences is that bilingual politicians, like Trudeau, will answer a question in the language used by the MP or a journalist who asked the question.\nAccording to the most recent data from Statistics Canada, about 42 per cent of the approximately 200,000 people in the Sherbrooke area are bilingual, able to speak and understand both official languages. \nOf the 10,000 in the region who listed English as their mother tongue, 77 per cent were also able to speak French.\nSherbrooke is also home to Bishop’s University, where English is the language of most instruction.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T15:41:32.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
