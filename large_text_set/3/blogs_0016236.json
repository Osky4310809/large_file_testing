Police and CPS policy offers no protection to those wrongfully accused and many lives are left in tatters.\n‘It is a problem that has to be acknowledged and not ignored for fear of putting genuine victims off reporting.’\nMr Varney claimed there was an ‘awful stigma’ surrounding sexual allegations and said the impact of having his name in the media associated with abhorrent allegations, despite being innocent, had been nightmarish.\nHe continued: ‘It impacts future prospects and you are never allowed to fully move forward when the fact that you have been accused is one click away on Google.\n'Homeless' man found dead in burning van had a full-time job ‘The pendulum has swung too far and fairness and balance needs to be restored so that the presumption of innocence is not completely eroded.\n‘I’d like to finish by saying a big thank you to my family, my friends and everyone who has stood by me.
