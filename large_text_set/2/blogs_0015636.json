It was originally made by Siemens, a German conglomerate that, along with several other companies, has faced lawsuits for allegedly using concentration camp labor during World War II. \nThe device was recovered from the Führerbunker (an air-raid shelter where Hitler spent his final days) in 1945 by a British officer named Ralph Rayner.

It’s a fairly sinister bit of kit and I’ve always lived in fear of someone trying to steal it. I’ve also been told it’ll bring me bad luck,” Ranulf told CNN. \nAside from the Soviets, it is believed that Rayner was most likely the first on the victor’s side to gain access to Hitler’s official bunker. \n“He could still smell burning flesh … a dreadful hellhole,” Ranulf said, recalling his father’s telling of the underground shelter. \nWhile the top bidder is not yet known, Ranulf hopes that the phone will ultimately be featured in a museum as “to remind the world of the horrors of war.” \nFollow Eric on Twitter \nSend tips to .
