And these cereal-covered cones from Soft Swerve are just the thing for 60-degree spring days. A post shared by vivianüêòüçç (@veedang_) on Feb 23, 2017 at 8:57am PST \nThe Lower East Side shop opened last November, but foodie Instagrammers have just begun blowing up your feed with these colorful cones now that it‚Äôs nice out. The store serves hipster-ish flavors including Matcha, Black Sesame (that‚Äôs the gray one) and Ube (that‚Äôs a purple yam, thus the purple one). \nAnd the best part: cereal toppings! You can get a cone dunked in Reese‚Äôs Puffs, corn flakes, Lucky Charms marshmallows or Fruity Pebbles. You heard it here first: Kiddie breakfast foods are in the midst of a serious comeback in NYC.
