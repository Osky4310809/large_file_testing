It was, too – although David Wagner did not see it quite like that. The German likes to rotate as a matter of course, to use the whole of his squad, and his policy was fully justified in earning a replay at the Etihad Stadium while keeping players fresh for a key game in the push for promotion on Tuesday. Pep Guardiola’s eight changes were less successful. Most of the creativity had been stripped out of his team and at times it felt as if Sergio Agüero was playing Town on his own. The striker is back in the side through necessity after the injury to Gabriel Jesus and City will be looking to his finishing ability against Monaco, although here was evidence that the attacking ideas normally provided by Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva will be just as important. Paul Wilson \n• FA Cup sixth round draw 5) Middlesbrough face Premier League versus FA Cup dilemma \nThis was the ‘Robbie Mustoe derby’. Remember Mustoe? Now the accomplished US-based face of NBC’s Premier League coverage, he was an intelligent, industrious midfielder who represented both clubs with distinction and was part of Middlesbrough’s class of 20 years ago – also featuring Juninho and Fabrizio Ravanelli – who reached the 1997 FA and League Cup finals but were relegated. With Aitor Karanka’s side embroiled in a relegation skirmish, it might have suited Boro to have been knocked out by now but a kind draw (Sheffield Wednesday, Accrington and Oxford, all at home) dictates they are one game from a Wembley semi-final. Does Karanka envy Rafa Benítez, whose Newcastle team lost at Oxford in the previous round ? Or does Boro’s manager reflect on flying into London before taking the job and, from his window seat, spying Wembley. “I want my team to win there,” he recalls.

Everyone knew he would field a team of reserves against Millwall, and his remarks beforehand suggested the first XI will return to face Sevilla in the Champions League on Wednesday. His reserves may have lost but they also showed fight as well as capability and players such as Ben Chilwell, Daniel Amartey, Molla Wagué and Bartosz Kapustka looked as if they could yet offer something different as the Foxes scrap for every league point. Furthermore the largely overlooked Shinji Okazaki may have missed two chances but his commitment stood out, even against an opposition defined by hard work. Ranieri should remain open to giving his second-choice men a chance to turn round the season. Paul MacInnes Leicester City’s Shinji Okazaki missed two chances against Millwall but showed commitment.

It was not just the visit of the Premier League leaders that brought the fans out; it was mainly admiration for their own team, which is young and enterprising. Paul Lambert spoke a few weeks ago about a trip he made to watch a Borussia Dortmund match last season. “I wasn’t in a job, so I just became a fan and loved it,” he said. “I had my hat, scarf and a few German beers. Jumping around, absolute magic.” There was a little bit of that at Molineux on Saturday, despite Wolves’ defeat (and the lack of German beer). Hopefully it intoxicated the club’s new owners, who had travelled from China to watch a match at the ground for the first time. “I think it’s important for the owners to see what this place can be like when it’s full,” Lambert said. “If you get in the Premier League, we’ll have many more nights like that.” Paul Doyle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:23:13.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
