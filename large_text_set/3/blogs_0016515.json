The House Intelligence Committee will hear from FBI Director James Comey on whether U.S. officials believe Russia tried to bolster Trump's chances in the election and if there were any connections between Moscow and Trump's campaign aides. \nTrump tweeted Monday: \"The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!\" \nA separate tweet referenced James Clapper, the director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama, who has said that Trump's allegation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower is false. \"James Clapper and others stated there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it.\" \nTrump also tweeted that the \"real story\" is the leaking of classified information. \n___ \n3:30 a.m. \nA congressional inquiry into Russian interference in the presidential election that has so far unfolded behind closed doors moves into the open with a public hearing featuring FBI Director James Comey. \nA hearing Monday before one of several congressional panels probing allegations of Russian meddling, the House Intelligence Committee, could allow for the greatest public accounting to date of investigations that have shadowed the Trump administration in its first two months. \nComey has been invited to testify, along with the director of the National Security Agency, Michael Rogers. \nThe committee is investigating, among other things, Russian hacking that intelligence officials have said was meant to influence the election. Also of interest to the committee are any connections between Russia and associates of President Donald Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T13:26:52.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
