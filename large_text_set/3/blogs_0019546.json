However, they were faced with regret upon receiving the replies. \"Instead of upfront compliance with what was primarily a request for information/status update on the implementation of the Reforms, they have used the pendency of various applications before this Hon'ble Court as an excuse to avoid necessary compliance,\" the Committee said \n\"Various State/Member Associations affiliated to the BCCI have addressed a number of letters seeking release of funds by BCCI for various purposes including payment of electricity bills, payment to players etc. This has been done despite the said State/Member Associations not having complied with this Hon'ble Court's orders dated October 7, 2016 and October 21, 2016,\" it added. \nThe CoA also hinted that the stand taken by the State/Member associations \"is part of a well thought out strategy of refusing to comply with the orders\" of the Court and hence allowing the players, employees and the cricketing operations to suffer. \nThe Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA), which will host the fourth Test between India and Australia in Dharamsala, has sought funds for the smooth functioning of the same. But the Committee points out that \"HPCA had an amount of Rs. 6,26,92,755/- (Rupees Six Crores Twenty Six Lakhs Ninety Two Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty Five only) in current/savings accounts and deposits as on March 31, 2016 and a further amount of Rs. 59,44,30,724/- (Rupees Fifty Nine Crores Forty Four Lakhs Thirty Thousand and Seven Hundred and Twenty Four only) was remitted by BCCI to HPCA between April 2016 and October 2016. This is without including an additional amount of Rs. 16.73 crores that was remitted on October 1, 2016 and has been directed to be kept in a term-deposit subject to further directions of this Hon'ble Court.\" \nMuch like the HPCA, the Saurashtra Cricket Association too has addressed more than one letter to the BCCI seeking release of funds including for the conduct of IPL matches. \"As per the audited accounts submitted by the SCA for financial year ending March 31, 2016, the SCA had an amount of Rs. 213,59,47,064/- (Rupees Two Hundred and Thirteen Crores Fifty Nine Lakhs Forty Seven Thousand and Sixty Four only) in current/savings accounts and deposits as on March 31, 2016 and a further amount of Rs 42,66,97,149/- (Rupees Forty Two Crores Sixty Six Lakhs Ninety Seven Thousand and One Hundred Forty Nine only) was remitted by BCCI to SCA between April 2016 and October 2016. This is without including an additional amount of Rs 16.73 crores that was remitted on October 1, 2016 and has been directed to be kept in a term deposit subject to further directions of this Hon'ble Court.\" \nFollowing strong resistance from the state cricket associations, CoA has also released the respective letters from the state bodies, revealing their reasons to not implement the reforms. Most of the state bodies didn't submit any undertakings or affidavits sought by the governing committee. Andhra Cricket Association raised its concern about the nine-year term rule for an office bearer, stating that there was no order in effect for the same. Cricket Association of Bengal, Jharkhand State Cricket Association, Karnataka State Cricket Association among others didn't produce the requisite documents, while Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association declared that it bode by the orders of the Supreme Court and appointed a three-member interim committee until fresh elections were held. \nThe Maharashtra Cricket Association objected about its applications regarding the disqualification lying pending before the apex court, and also claimed that it hadn't received any grants since October 2016. The Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association went along the same lines, also stating that the obligations upon the state bodies would come only after the national body adopted the reforms itself. \nApart from issues like the non-receipt of grants and websites not having the required information, the majority of the bodies didn't submit the undertakings. \nHyderabad Cricket Association though submitted all the necessary documents, besides stating all details on its own website. It also complied with the directives of the Lodha committee, while being in the process of implementing the reforms as of November 20, 2016. The Railways Sports Promotion Board directly declined, stating that it will not be able to entrust the functions of the board to anyone other than government functionaries, since it came under the aegis of Ministry of Railways. \nWhile the deadlock regarding the compliance of the reforms continues, the state associations await the proceedings on March 27, when the apex court is expected to hear their plea again. But prior to this, the apex court will hear out CoA's side of affairs on March 24. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:47:27.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
