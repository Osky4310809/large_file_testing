She says the crowds love it and often join in. \nThe video has been viewed by millions of people since it was released and when asked what her son thought of all of the attention she said, “He thinks it’s so cool,” Paige told CTVNews.ca. “I’m just kind of in shock.” \nWatch and share this dancing goalie with your friends and family!
