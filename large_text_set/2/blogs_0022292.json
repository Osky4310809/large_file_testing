With five fours and three sixes in his entertaining innings, Starc's effort from no 8 arrested the slide that saw Australia lose eight wickets for the addition of 86 runs. At stumps, Starc was unbeaten on 57 while adding 51 with Josh Hazlewood (1*) for the 10th wicket. 08:06 AM (IST) Hello and welcome to our live coverage from the Day 2 of the first Test between India and Australia being underway in Pune. So.... That didn't take long. Took Ravichandran Ashwin only 5 deliveries to wrap things up. The ideal start for Virat Kohli and his men. Now, they trail by 260 runs and their main objective will be to post a big first innings total. Stay tuned as the Indians will be coming out to bat soon. 94.5 OVERS Australia: 260/10 R Ashwin to Starc, OUT! India have got a start they would've liked. Floated delivery, outside off, Starc kneels and slog sweeps to go over deep mid-wicket. He gets the connection but the elevation wasn't quite there. Jadeja takes an easy catch. AUSTRALIA ARE ALL OUT FOR 260. 94.4 OVERS Australia: 260/9 R Ashwin to Starc, Starc goes forward to defend but is beaten by the turn. 94.3 OVERS Australia: 260/9 R Ashwin to Starc, Bowls this outside off, Starc looks to defend but gets beaten. 94.2 OVERS Australia: 260/9 R Ashwin to Starc, FOUR! Attack straightaway. Starc doesn't want to waste any time. Looped up delivery around off, Starc lofts it over mid on for a boundary. 94.1 OVERS Australia: 256/9 R Ashwin to Starc, Ashwin initiates his ball with a tossed up delivery outside off, Starc prods forward and defends it. We are ready to get underway as the players and umpires have made their way out in the middle. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood to continue with the bat, their objective will be to score as briskly as possible. Ravichandran Ashwin to start off with the ball first up... Pitch Report - There are cracks and rough areas, somewhere around a short of a length, that will cause the batsmen to think about what to do. The key is to play as late as possible, as it was shown by Matt Renshaw yesterday. Playing late will allow the batsmen to play any kind of shot they want, either attack or defend. It's a dry surface, there's a bit more turn, a bit more exaggeration. So the advice from the centre is to play as late as possible. Hello and welcome to the coverage of Day 2 of the 1st Test between India and Australia. As expected, the Pune deck started spinning from the word go. Despite that, the Australians showed grit and determination to score 256 runs at the loss of 9 wickets. At one stage, it seemed like they would be bundled out below 250 but Mitchell Starc played a counter-attacking innings and slammed his 9th Test fifty. Starc and Hazlewood are still at the centre and their aim would be to take their total close to 300. Can they do so or will India will bundle them out in the first few overs itself? We will find out soon... ... DAY 2, SESSION 1 ... For India, they had their moments but would be ruing the fact that they let the advantage slip. They had a golden chance to bundle out the Aussies today itself but some great fighting spirit from Starc and Hazlewood denied them. Umesh Yadav was the best bowler, picking up a 4-fer. Ashwin was good in parts while Jadeja had a tough outing today. The track isn't easy to bat on and with the total that the Aussies have got on the board, they should fancy their chances to have a go at the Indian batsmen tomorrow. How much more will Starc add? Join us tomorrow to catch all the action from day 2. Until then, it's goodbye from us. Cheers! Earlier in the day, Australia did well in the first session as openers Warner and Renshaw played with a calm head. But once the opening stand was broken, the middle order couldn't capitalize. Smith, S. Marsh, Handscomb all got starts but none of them could convert it and were trapped against a wily attack. Renshaw who was retired ill came out in the second session and registered his first fifty in the sub-continent. When he was looking to up the ante he fell prey to Ashwin and the Aussies were on the mat. That brings us to the end of what has been an intriguing day of Test cricket. Mitchell Starc and his striking will be the talking point of the day as he has taken apart the Indian bowling attack and has not only registered his fifty but has also taken his team's total past the 250-run mark. Take a bow, Mitchell! 93.6 OVERS Australia: 256/9 I Sharma to Hazlewood, Ishant Sharma comes steaming in and arrows it on a fullish length, it's going across Josh Hazlewood who plants his front foot forward and withdraws his bat to let it go past him. A day which has ended well for Australia, THAT'S STUMPS ON DAY 1! 93.5 OVERS Australia: 256/9 I Sharma to Hazlewood, Fires this way, way outside off, it's so far out that Josh doesn't bother himself with it. 93.4 OVERS Australia: 256/9 I Sharma to Hazlewood, Another play and another miss. It's outside off and Hazlewood misses to connect. 93.3 OVERS Australia: 256/9 I Sharma to Hazlewood, Sprays this well outside off, on a length, Hazlewood just throws his bat at this. Once again doesn't make any contact. 93.2 OVERS Australia: 256/9 I Sharma to Hazlewood, Angles across a back of a length delivery, around off, Hazlewood with absolutely no foot movement looks to cut it away. Misses though as Wriddhiman Saha behind the stumps collects it safely in his gloves. 93.1 OVERS Australia: 256/9 I Sharma to Starc, Marginally ahead of a length, in that off stump channel, it's pushed square of the wicket on the off side for an easy single. 92.6 OVERS Australia: 255/9 R Ashwin to Hazlewood, Sliding down with the angle, raps Hazlewood on the pads as he attempts to flick. No way that would have ever been given lbw. 92.5 OVERS Australia: 255/9 R Ashwin to J Hazlewood, On the fuller side this time, driven to mid off for nothing. 92.4 OVERS Australia: 255/9 R Ashwin to Hazlewood, Length ball outside off, it's cut away to the point region for no run. 92.3 OVERS Australia: 255/9 R Ashwin to Hazlewood, Good line from Ravi Ashwin. Floated on off, turns ever so slightly and whiskers past the outside edge as Josh attempts to block off the front foot. 92.2 OVERS Australia: 255/9 R Ashwin to Hazlewood, Flighted on a driving length, outside off, Josh makes a watchful leave. 50-run stand between Starc and Hazlewood! 92.1 OVERS Australia: 255/9 R Ashwin to Starc, From around the wicket, it's pushed quicker through the air outside off, Starc pushes it square of the wicket on the off side for a single. 91.7 OVERS Australia: 254/9 I Sharma to Hazlewood, On a good length, on the stumps, defended back down the track solidly to end the over. 91.6 OVERS Australia: 254/9 I Sharma to Starc, No ball! Good length ball on middle and leg, a bit too straight as the batsman tucks it in front of mid-wicket. No ball signalled as Ishant overstepped his line. 91.5 OVERS Australia: 252/9 I Sharma to Starc, Takes some of the pace off and bowls a cutter outside off, Mitchell Starc is initially tempted into the shot but then withdraws at the last second to let it through. 91.4 OVERS Australia: 252/9 I Sharma to Starc, Full ball well outside off, Starc just slaps it to covers. The fielder at extra cover, who is standing right at the edge of the circle, does well to run to his left and make a tumbling stop. 91.3 OVERS Australia: 252/9 I Sharma to Starc, Length delivery aiming the top of off stump, Mitchell Starc stands firm and pushes it back down the track. 91.2 OVERS Australia: 252/9 I Sharma to Starc, Shaping away from Mitchell Starc, from around off, it's left alone for the keeper to collect. 91.1 OVERS Australia: 252/9 I Sharma to Starc, Back of a length delivery angling across, blocked off the back foot. 90.6 OVERS Australia: 252/9 R Ashwin to Hazlewood, Fuller around off, defended easily by Hazlewood. 90.5 OVERS Australia: 252/9 R Ashwin to Hazlewood, Quicker through the air on middle, raps him on the pads as Josh comes forward to play. Although, the leg before calls are shut down as the ball took the inside edge first before hitting the pads. 90.4 OVERS Australia: 252/9 R Ashwin to Hazlewood, Some drift and some dip on that occasion as Ashwin floats it right up there, Hazlewood comes ahead and blocks. 90.3 OVERS Australia: 252/9 R Ashwin to Starc, From around the wicket, Ashwin bowls a slider on middle and leg, Starc goes back and punches it to long on for a run. 90.2 OVERS Australia: 251/9 R Ashwin to Starc, Tossed up outside leg, Starc pads it away. 90.1 OVERS Australia: 251/9 R Ashwin to Hazlewood, Loopy and on a fuller length, on the pads, worked away behind square on the leg side for one. 89.6 OVERS Australia: 250/9 I Sharma to Starc, Plays it safe. Doesn't move much and keeps this length ball out to end the over. 9th Test fifty for Mitchell Starc! 89.5 OVERS Australia: 250/9 I Sharma to M Starc, FOUR! Back of a length on the hips, Starc swivels and pulls it through backward square leg for a boundary. Brings up his fifty with that and he's done so in style, at brisk pace too. Lovely stuff. And with this, Australia have reached the 250-run mark as well. 89.4 OVERS Australia: 246/9 I Sharma to Starc, The batsman has driven the full ball straight back. 89.3 OVERS Australia: 246/9 I Sharma to Starc, FOUR!
