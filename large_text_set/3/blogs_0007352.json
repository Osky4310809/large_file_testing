I was caught between nerves and excitement knowing very well you’d be there. \nThen you walked in and our eyes met only you weren’t alone. \nI tried not to stare but I couldn’t help myself when you took her hand leading the way. The smile on the face hid a bit of heartbreak and disappointment. \nAnd with one introduction and an awkward glance your way, I knew in no words at all we both said everything we needed to. I looked down and tried to look away in hopes that everything I felt wasn’t written across my face. \nBut I knew you knew. \nWe did a little dance avoiding each other but I was simply in the wrong place again at the wrong time, left looking at another person whose story came to a dead end on a road I stood on alone. \nI hated that her presence and hand in yours, made me question myself and not you.\n\nBut a reel of questions ran through my mind I couldn’t control. \nWas she prettier? Was she smarter? Was she more successful than me? Was she more fun to be with? And why wasn’t I enough? But instead, I laughed and smiled and engaged in a conversation like it wasn’t hurting me to do so. \nI was stronger than I wanted to be.\nI walked home alone that night when I didn’t have to. \nI was met with goodbye as he kissed my cheek entering a cab asking again if I’d change my mind. \nBut the truth was I would have rather been alone than in the wrong company using someone to fill a void you left. The truth is I would have still picked you if only you would have done the same. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:57:18.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
