Have something you want discussed? . This week’s topic: spreading out development in Detroit. Every time we make a map of development or construction, it’s very concentrated in one small part of Detroit. We know that creating density in the core is important, and there’s still a lot of work to do in Downtown and Midtown. But it’s such a big city, and we’d all like to see more development in the neighborhoods. Dan Gilbert says he needs more office space ? There’s a lot of room out there! So we’re asking you this week, where would you like to see the next wave of development in Detroit? We’re seeing a lot of buildings getting redeveloped at the end of the QLINE in New Center ; there’s certainly plenty of room down the Woodward corridor. Perhaps if the State Fairgrounds project gets off the ground this year, that could spur more development in that area? Peter Cummings has invested some cash into the Old Redford/Brightmoor area; perhaps a few other investors could pitch in up there? So much is happening in the Live6 neighborhoods to help businesses and housing; are there surrounding areas that could see a boost from strategic, inclusive development? It’s a big city out there with a lot of land and a lot of buildings. Where would you like to see more investment, Curbed readers? Where do you see the most opportunity in the city?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:04:00.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
