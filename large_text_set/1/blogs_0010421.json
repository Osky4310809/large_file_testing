Breakfast (till 11 a.m.) will include egg and cheese biscuits; sticky buns; biscuits and gravy; and rice, grits, homemade chorizo, and eggs. \nLunch will include four soups, four salads, and four sandwiches, while dinner will include a nightly blue-plate special - steak frites, beef stew, meat loaf. \nThere's a touch of Jewishness in a few dishes. Cook said O'Shea has developed a smoked matzo ball soup. (Smoked? It's the schmaltz.) The take on a BLT will sub a latke for the lettuce. Chicken pot pie will be made Yemenite-style. \nThere will be a vegetarian item in each category, including a lentil sloppy Joe with avocado and fried onion. \nDesserts will include coconut cream pie, Dutch apple pie, and shakes. \nSince there's a liquor license, expect four beers on tap, canned wine, and classic cocktails. \nThe idea for Rooster Soup sprang from a conundrum faced at Federal Donuts, which specializes in doughnuts, fried chicken, and coffee from Bodhi: What to do with unused chicken backs? Rooster Soup, therefore, will use FedNuts' leftovers. \nBoxwood Architects' design includes a 18-seat counter and bar, booths and tables in the rear accommodating up to 40.
