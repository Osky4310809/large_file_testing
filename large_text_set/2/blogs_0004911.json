I'm lucky I have East facing windows that overlook a pretty stellar viewpoint of the neighborhood, and all my furnishings fit in just right. I love being home, it's tranquil, full of plants, and steps from some of the best views in the Bay. \nThanks, Kirstie! \n• Interested in sharing your home with Apartment Therapy?
