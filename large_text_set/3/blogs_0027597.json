Lukas Podolski celebrates scoring the decisive goal on his big day (Photo: REUTERS) It was one of Podolski's final acts in international football (Photo: REUTERS) Germany \nGermany’s No.2 but still a superb keeper. Busier than Hart, good saves. \nKimmich 6 \nGot exposed down his flank, especially with Sane offering little protection. \nRudiger 6 \nRoma defender who has been watched by Chelsea and Man City \nHummels 6 \nDidn’t relish Vardy’s pace or runs which stretched him. Solid though. Hummels challenges Vardy for the ball (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nHector 6 \nTried to get forward, but little chance to overlap. Solid defensively. \nKroos 7 \nNormally runs the entire shooting match, still supplied nice pass for Podolski. \nWeigl 6 \nHigh on a few Premier League wish lists, solid enough, but didn’t catch the eye. \nSane 6 \nThe Man City wideman was well taken care of by both England full backs. Sane challenges Bertrand for the ball (Photo: Lars Baron) \nPodolski 7 \nIt felt like Podolski’s testimonial, and what a goal to remember it by. \nBrandt 5 \nOffered very little, slashed one chance wide, subbed early. Poor. \nWerner 6 \nEnjoying prolific season for RB Leipzig, did not really grasp his chance. \nSubstitutes \nSchurrle, for Brandt, 59 mins, 6 \nCan, for Wiegl, 66 mins, 6 \nMuller, for Werner, 77 mins \nRudy, for Podolski, 84 mins Podolski scored on his farewell match (Photo: Lars Baron) England \nHad quieter night of the two keepers. Note to Pep: played out from the back. \nWalker 7 \nPlenty of energy and forward runs down the right flank. Excellent. \nKeane 7 \nWhat a place to make your debut and looked comfortable in his surroundings. Michael Keane and Julian Brandt battle for the ball (Photo: PA Wire) \nSmalling 7 \nEnjoyed being the kingpin in the middle, great pace and tenacity. \nCahill 7 \nWore the armband with pride, looks so comfortable in a back three. \nBertrand 7 \nLooked composed and solid, put a strong case in Rose’s absence. \nDier 7 \nWent close with a header and a free kick. Bossed midfield very nicely. Dier played in a slightly more attacking role for England (Photo: Michael Regan - The FA) \nLivermore 7 \nHis first start for England and was not intimidated, strong and composed. \nAlli 8 MOTM \nEngland’s best player, has the makings of a world class talent. Superb. \nLallana 7 \nFabulous run and shot in the first half deserved a goal, but hit the post. Lallana hit the post for England early in the game (Photo: Bongarts/Getty Images) \nVardy 6 \nLucky not to be booked for an early dive. Worked and pressed hard. \nSubstitutes \nRedmond, for Lallana, 66 mins, 6 \nRashford, for Vardy, 70 mins, 6 \nLingard, for Alli, 72 mins, 6 \nWard-Prowse, for Livermore, 83 mins \nShaw, for Bertrand, 83 mins Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:54:13.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
