After having working with a couple of ads with Ranveer, both are signed to play the main leads in Zoya Akhtar’s Gully Boy. Meanwhile Alia Bhatt will star opposite Ranbir Kapoor in Ayan Mukherji’s next, Dragon . Whenever Ayan and Ranbir have joined hands, they have produced magic in their last two collaborations, Wake Up Sid and Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani. Now with Alia Bhatt having the best run of her career, Dragon seems even more special. \nThere have been reports that the movie belongs to the superhero genre, with both Ranbir and Alia Bhatt playing superheroes who can shoot fire with their hands (Hence the title Dragon!). But during a recent media interaction, while promoting her upcoming movie Badrinath Ki Dulhania, Alia Bhatt clarified the genre for us. She said Dragon is more of a supernatural kind of flick, and she also went on to say that it will be like nothing you have seen before. Wow, that’s surely made us more excited about the project. \nDragon is produced under the umbrella of Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions. Amitabh Bachchan is said to play an important role in the movie. \nAlia Bhatt will be next seen in Badrinath Ku Dulhania, a sort of sequel to Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania. Varun Dhawan again plays her romantic interest in the romcom which is directed by Shashank Khaitan.
