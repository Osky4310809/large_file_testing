As soon as the beat comes in, you know you’re in for something totally different. It’s wonky and funky, weird and cool at the same time. Staples’ raspy chill verses are perfect on top of the track’s otherworldly nature. \nIt’s dark, but it’s also pretty uptempo, so when Party Favor was approached for the official remix, he saw a good opportunity to slow things down — the wonk turns down in favor of some grungy trap sounds. \nThe remix is one of a few in a full package that sees official release Friday, Jan. 25, but you can listen to it’s sludgy goodness below exclusively on Billboard Dance .
