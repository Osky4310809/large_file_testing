Well. \nThe Clippers have already been playing without Blake Griffin for almost a month, and now they will be without their full-strength starting lineup for even longer. While L.A. has treaded water just fine sans Griffin, Paul is a much more foundational player. The bulk of his minutes will now go to Austin Rivers, who, while no longer completely butt, is nothing close to the all-around puppet master that Chris Paul is. It’s like replacing the engine of your car with a papier-mâché model of a car engine.   \nThe Clippers are currently fourth in the west, only a few games ahead of the now-healthy Utah Jazz, but that doesn’t seem too likely to hold, since the team is about to get into the roughest portion of their schedule . Paul will almost certainly be back for the playoffs, but the team may not have home-court advantage in the first round, and may even face one of the three truly elite teams in the west.
