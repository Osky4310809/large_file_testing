Saraki \n“His predecessor, Issa Hayatou had served the organisation well; now, we look forward to the new leadership to usher in an era of change and effectiveness to raise the standard of African football across all levels.” \nSaraki also urged Football Associations (FA) across the continent to rally support for the new CAF president to deliver on his electioneering promises for the good of African football. \n“This is a new beginning and we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. \n“African football has been yearning for a new direction and now that this opportunity to inject fresh blood into the management of CAF has been realised, it is time for stakeholders to extend the frontiers and fortunes of African football at the global level,” Saraki said. \nHe commended the outgoing President of CAF, Issa Hayatou, for his services and contributions to the development of football in Africa in his 29-year headship of the body.
