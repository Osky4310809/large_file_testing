Because it feels like HBO has been promoting Big Little Lie s for two full years. Or maybe I’ve just been following Reese Witherspoon for too long (she essentially live-Instagrammed the show’s entire production). \nAdvertisement \n\nBy the time the seven-episode series premiered on Sunday, I’d somehow convinced myself the show had aired, won a few Emmys, and been forgotten. But whoops! It hadn’t. Big Little Lies , based on the Liane Moriarty book of the same name, has just gotten started—and appears to be a sharper, smarter version of American Beauty, one that’s a little lighter on its feet and filmed with a wider lens.\nThe setup is simple, and instantly compelling, thanks in part to a gorgeous production helmed by Wild director Jean-Marc Vallée. Someone from an affluent Monterey, California neighborhood has been murdered, and just about everyone in town (or at least every A-lister in the cast) seems to have been capable of doing it. The series begins immediately following the murder, which occurred during a fundraiser, and flashes back to the moment those being interrogated by police say everything changed: when a working-class newcomer, Jane Chapman (Shailene Woodley), meets Madeline Mckenzie (Reese Witherspoon), one of the mothers in town vying for the title of queen bee.\nAdvertisement \n\nMonterey, we soon learn, is filled with people who are as rich as they are ruthless. But, like so many HBO characters before, they’re privately very sad. Sad about their kids not liking them. Sad about other moms not liking them. Sad about not having the families or careers they dreamed of. So maybe the ones who seemed mean at first are actually pretty OK and incapable of murder! And maybe the ones who seemed nice at first are actually monsters and quite capable of murder! This ambiguity is how the show hooks you, and everyone involved is talented enough to make sure it goes in deep.\nI’m going to focus on Reese Witherspoon for a moment. Oh, Reese Witherspoon. Reese Witherspoon is amazing in this. After watching her spend the past few years of her career (you know, the ones following that incident when she got super hammered and yelled at a cop), the book-loving Draper James founder has done a phenomenal job convincing the public that she’s just a nice, old-fashioned, southern gal. (Not the racist kind, the sweet tea-drinkin’, y’all-sayin’ kind). \n\nA text sent by the author while watching episode one. This has been especially frustrating to me, because I simply don’t buy most of it. There is something about Witherspoon’s rehearsed smile that suggests she’s covering up a sort of... delightful nastiness. To me, Witherspoon seems like a generally positive, friendly woman whose meanness definitely exists, but is careful to never expose itself beyond the safety of a dinner table with close friends, or anywhere there’s free-flowing champagne and zero cameras. Thank god she was cast as Madeline Mackenzie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:42:33.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
