Actually, it’s not technically CES until tomorrow morning either way, but here we are at the Las Vegas Convention Center, nonetheless. \nThis week is always a big one for the hardware giant, hitting a broad spectrum of the company’s various hardware categories. It’s always a big show for TVs/video for the company. Bigger, skinnier flat screens, blu-ray players galore and 4K, 8K and all the various other Ks. \nIt’s also been a fairly big show for Sony’s offerings in the past, so maybe some news on the speaker and Walkman front. Phones are a possibility, but most manufacturers seem to be holding off for MWC in a month or two to make their big announcements on that front. \nWhatever the case, join us here live at 5PM ET to find out what the future holds for Sony.
