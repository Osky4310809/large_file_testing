From Green Lantern to Deadpool, Ryan has had a lot of different super powers throughout his acting career.\nEven though he already packs a lot of superhero cred, somehow, he recently upped the ante by assembling the most impressive team of heroes we’ve ever seen.\nRyan Reynolds joined up with Hugh Jackman and Pierce Brosnan to bring us the superhuman squad we didn’t know we needed, and we are all eyes. That’s right: the actors that play Wolverine, pre-Daniel Craig James Bond, and Wade Wilson posed for a ver special photo together. And now we can’t stop thinking about the amazing things these three could do for humanity.\nWolvie. Bond. Wade. \nA photo posted by Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds) on Jan 17, 2017 at 2:03am PST \n“Wolvie. Bond. Wade,” is how Ryan describes the iconic trio in the caption. We love their “hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil” poses. Very appropriate for a team of superheroes.\nAnyway, now that we’ve seen it (thanks, Ryan), we can’t help but wish it into being. So, question for all you big Hollywood producers: how do we get a Wolverine/Deadpool/007 movie in the making? Because it totally seems like these guys are down, and we would DEFINITELY go see it.\nOf course, until this universe-crossing trio can come into being (and we would very much like it if that happened) we do have Hugh Jackman’s final outing as Wolverine to look forward to in Logan . It may not be a Bond/Wade/Logan team-up, but it looks awesome nonetheless.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:30:27.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
