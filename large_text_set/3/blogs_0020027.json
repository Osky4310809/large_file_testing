They were OK, they was players, but the fact that the old Curry wasn’t no All-Star, he wasn’t cold. He could shoot the ball though. Kobe Bryant, his dad wasn’t all that, that’s why he’s such a monster.”\nYou got LeBron, it’s gonna be so hard for his kids, cause they gonna look at them like ‘you gotta be just like your dad. And after a while that pressure starts sitting on you like ‘why do I gotta be like him, why can’t I just be me?’ And then they’re gonna be like ‘aw, you’re soft, you’re not that good.’ Because the expectation is very, very high.”\nMy sons are good, they’re great,” Ball said. “But let’s say I really excelled in football and made millions of millions of dollars. Do I spent that time with them now? — No, I have to worry about the offseason and I just buy you a trainer and hope that you turn out okay. Whereas the fact that I wasn’t all that, allows me to take the time to make my boys all that.”\nLeBron caught wind of LaVar’s comments and delivered a very serious message for the elder Ball. \nVia ESPN \nKeep my kids’ name out of your mouth “Keep my family out of your mouth.”\n“This is dad to dad. It’s a problem now.” \nWell, that escalated quickly. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:11:57.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
