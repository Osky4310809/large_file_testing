Nearly every episode had an explosive fight or a visit from “Tequila Katie.” But, passion prevailed, and they tied the knot—in front of the cameras, of course.\nOn Monday’s season finale, their wedding episode will appear on Bravo, sans big fights and blowouts (which may be a first for the series!). So, we caught up with Maloney to get the real scoop of exactly what went down on her big day, starting with all the details on her $15,000 wedding dress.\nWhen it came to dress shopping, she hit up the infamous Kleinfeld Bridal store in N.Y.C. (home of Say Yes to the Dress ) with her family and bridesmaids (including Stassi Schroeder, Kristin Doute and Scheana Marie). After trying on five other dresses , she knew she had a winner when the stylist brought out her Zuhair Murad long-sleeve lace design. The designer is beloved by celebrities, such as Jennifer Lopez, Adele, Chrissy Teigen and more.\n“The minute I put it on there were goosebumps all over,” she tells PeopleStyle. “I thought, ‘This is it. This is the dress I’m going to marry Tom in.’ You just know. I had such a visceral reaction it was awesome.”\nShe says she did try on a few others to be sure, but says her dress just “felt” like her. “The lace and the detail was so perfect,” she says. “It felt like it was vintage, unique and special.”\nThe beautiful @musickillskate and @twschwa were married! #pumprules Congratulations #vanderpumprules #twobubbs Katie is wearing a beautiful #wedding gown by @zuhairmuradofficial @lisavanderpump married the couple #photooftheday by @theparisienneinla \nA post shared by Laced in Weddings (@lacedinweddings) on Aug 18, 2016 at 8:13am PDT\nFlashback of @musickillskate when she said yes to the dress at @kleinfeldbridal stunning @zuhairmuradofficial #wedding dress #pumprules #vanderpumprules #twobubbs \nA post shared by Laced in Weddings (@lacedinweddings) on Aug 18, 2016 at 12:57pm PDT\nRELATED PHOTOS: The Bride Wore What ? Unconventional Celeb Wedding Dresses \nWhen it came to her bridal beauty, she left it to the professionals on her big day so she could relax and enjoy the moment, despite the fact she’s a total pro at doing her own makeup and hair (remember Pucker and Pout ?). “I love doing my own hair and makeup; it’s my favorite time of the day,” she explains. “But my whole thing was work my a—s off to get everything finalized so I can sit and enjoy my day. So the last thing I wanted was any kind of anxiety about how my makeup and hair would come together.”\nShe knew exactly what look she was going for — something very simple for her makeup (she wanted to still look like herself) and an updo, which she knew Tom would love. “Tom likes my hair up so I wanted to wear my hair up and have it loose and ethereal so it would match with the vibe of the dress and the vibe of the wedding.”\nAs for their wedding bands, they went to their friend and jeweler, Kyle Chan, for matching designs. Both feature a rose gold band accented with champagne diamonds, which matches the 14 karat rose gold setting of her pear-shaped diamond engagement ring (also designed by Chan).\nSo I said… YES!!!! \nA post shared by Katie Maloney-Schwartz (@musickillskate) on Jul 7, 2015 at 10:12pm PDT\nLooking back, she says there isn’t one thing she would do differently on her big day, but she would advise other brides-to-be to give themselves ample time to plan their nuptials. “I don’t recommend planning a wedding in 12 weeks,” she explains, noting the reason she pushed the planning process was because that was the date available at their venue.\nDancing in the moonlight! I want to relive this every minute of everyday. Thank you @pandoravt for this boomerang! @twschwa ❤️❤️❤️ \nA post shared by Katie Maloney-Schwartz (@musickillskate) on Aug 25, 2016 at 5:12pm PDT\nEven though Maloney says the entire wedding went off without a hitch, it is a bit surprising given how many dramatic fights the couple has had throughout the season. Their tensions came to a head during their joint bachelor/bachelorette parties in New Orleans when Doute brought up Schwartz’s cheating allegations.\n“It was something that doesn’t sit well with me and it’s a source of my frustrations and anxiety and overall mood when it comes to Tom sometimes,” Maloney says. “As much as I tried to move past it, he did really betray my trust and it’s something I’ve had a hard time restoring in him.”\nShe says after that trip she felt like their relationship “hit rock bottom.”\n“I just knew we either needed to turn things around and really recommit and change our attitudes or walk away from it all,” she says. “The one constant thing in our relationship has been our commitment and how much we’ve fought for our relationship because we believe in it and love each other so much. So we had this revelation and we said in New Orleans we had to burn our relationship down to the ground so it could grow back healthier.”\nSo before the wedding Maloney says they “reconnected and recommitted” to each other. “We decided that all of the resentment and negative things we’re hitting the delete button. We made sure we weren’t bringing that into our future and into our next chapter. It was a quick turn around but because we both wanted it so badly we both took the time to connect with each other.”\nThese days she says married life is “amazing” and while their day-to-day routines haven’t changed, their relationship is much more relaxed now. “Nothing has changed our dynamic or we’re not different people, but overall our approach to our relationship is very different. There’s not as much pressure or ultimatum, we’re just settling in to spending the rest of our lives together.”\nPart of that future may include kids pretty soon. “The talks about kids and when to start a family have become way more real. It’s not just hypothetical anymore. Now we’re asking, ‘When?'”\nWhat did you think of her wedding dress? Did you have any doubts they would tie the knot?
