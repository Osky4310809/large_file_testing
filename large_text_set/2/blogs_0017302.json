Officials in Parachute, the small town in western Colorado where the drive-thru will be located, granted the license yesterday.\nThe group behind the venture, Green Cross Colorado LLC, hopes to open in March, 2017. However, the drive-thru will still need to follow the strict rules governing the substance, including barring anyone under 21-years-old from the premises, even if they are in the backseat of the car.\nParachute had previously banned all legal selling of marijuana, despite the state’s liberal stance on the substance. Officials repealed the ban in June 2015, and now roughly 30 percent of Parachute’s sales tax revenue in 2016 came from legal marijuana, reports USA Today .\nWe suspect this will be the first of many across marijuana-friendly states. Stay tuned for more information.\nIn other news, this solar-powered catamaran gives us a look at the future of “green” yachting.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:39:50.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
