No doubt countless artists have expressed similar aspirations; few have been as consistently successful in achieving them as the celebrated painter from Yorkshire. Tate Britain’s extensive retrospective, staged in honour of Mr Hockney’s upcoming 80th birthday, testifies to plenty of uninhibited experiments over a six-decade career. Yet while his methods and style have altered almost continuously, his eye has remained trained on the people and places he has known and loved. This humanism, as well as his fidelity to representation, has given Mr Hockney a broad popular appeal from the get-go. He was a celebrity by the 1970s, known for his bleach-blond hair and thick-rimmed glasses as much as his virtuosic painting skills. (“Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy” [1971], the decade-defining portrait of designers Ossie Clark and Celia Birtwell, was purchased by the Tate just months after it was completed.) Already, the record-breaking advance ticket sales and lengthy queues snaking into this retrospective are confirming his status as Britain’s best-known living painter. Plans for the show to travel on to the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York will be strengthening, not establishing, his considerable reputation abroad. Given that Mr Hockney has been in the public eye for so long, this retrospective is surprisingly revelatory. There are few better ways, for instance, to appreciate the impact that America had on his work than to step from an aggressively grey February day in London into a room of his paintings from the late 1960s. For here, at the heart of the exhibition, is fantasy California: sunny, sexy playground of louche-living stars. Landing in Los Angeles for the first time in the winter of 1963, Mr Hockney sent a postcard to his dealer, Paul Kasmin. “Arrived in the promised land 2 days ago,” he wrote. “The world’s most beautiful city is here—L.A.” His sleek pairings of tanned naked men and aquamarine water, such as “Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool” (1966), are the antithesis of post-war austerity England in which he had been brought up. Mr Hockney’s discovery of California, where he lived for large periods of his life, changed the way he saw. An enduring attraction to clear space and undiluted colour became manifest; a few paintings from this time, such as the beautifully spare “Savings and Loan Buildings” (1967)—a glass building block set against an unvaried cyan sky—appear almost abstract. Though this level of formal restraint has long disappeared from his compositions, California’s intense colours have never left his palette. Some of his later paintings are so bright, their colour clashes so relentless, that they are hard to look at for long. The work that predates Mr Hockney’s love-affair with America tends towards fantasy and is characterised by a knowing naivety inspired by Picasso, Dubuffet and Bacon. Like them, the ease with which he can capture a likeness—most evident in a room dedicated to works on paper, and in his double portraits from the 1960s and 1970s—freed him to unpick conventional picture-making from early on in his career. It is significant that the first room of pictures, all dating from different decades, are collected under the heading “Play within a play”, after a strange 1963 painting (pictured, above) of the same name. Depicting Mr Kasmin standing on a theatre stage, pressing his face up against an actual piece of glass covering the canvas, the painting teases the viewer’s expectations of what is an illusion and what is real. Pictorial tricks such as this recur throughout his career; even some of his most straightforward paintings integrate a Polaroid-like frame as a reminder of their artificiality. A group of brazen and inventive paintings from 1960-62 show this painterly cheek transformed into extraordinary courage. Homosexuality was illegal in Britain until 1967, and yet Mr Hockney unambiguously comes out in these pictures. Filling the canvases with a disquieting synthesis of childish figures, audaciously phallic imagery, consumer packaging and provocative words, he mobilises the language of the dominant artistic movements of the day—abstract expressionism and pop—to express highly personal experiences, ranging from the troubling to the ecstatic. This difficult, daring side to Mr Hockney has for so long been subsumed by the friendly landscapes, still-lifes and portraits that have dominated his output in recent decades, that its reappearance provides a stimulating shock of surprise. While his gift for painting the sun-kissed surfaces of his life may be well-known, this retrospective reveals that he can also capture something of its darker depths. “David Hockney” is showing at Tate Britain until May 29th 2017.
