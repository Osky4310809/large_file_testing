AP/File \nMANILA, Philippinesâ€”The Department of National Defense on Friday blamed communist rebels for a hitch in peace talks, which were resumed last year after breaking down during the Aquino administration. In a statement, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana criticized the New People's Army for extortion, abduction and attacks on government forces that he said caused the deaths of civilians and soldiers. \nLorenzana blamed the violence instigated by the rebels as the reason the \"promising start to achieving peace has ended.\" \nThe secretary of defense also said that he had already instructed the military to be on high alert and to continue protecting the communities under their respective jurisdictions. \n\"I have instructed the chief of staff to place our troops on high alert and to continue their protection of the communities under their care, wherever they are,\" Lorenzana said. \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte announced earlier Friday that the government was lifting its unilateral ceasefire with the NPA. He said that rebels were asking for too much by demanding the release of some 400 political prisoners even before parties sign a more permanent bilateral ceasefire agreement. \nThe president ordered government troops on Friday afternoon: \"Go back to your camps, clean your rifles, and be ready to fight\"   \nThe NPA, which is on the US State Department's list of terrorist organizations, recently declared that it was ending its unilateral ceasefire effective Feb 11. The group blamed the failure of the government to release political prisoners and the intrusion of security forces into areas \"within the authority of the revolutionary government.\" \nThe government and communist rebels are currently engaged in peace talks in Europe in a bid to end the 48-year insurgency, the longest in Asia. \nRounds of negotiations failed in the past due to unmet rebel demands and to distrust on both sides.
