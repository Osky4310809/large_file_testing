What else is there? \n“There isn't much else. What else can you do? He's not going to compromise the government's reputation on fiscal integrity and we're not going to be borrowing more. That's very clear.\" \nPension relief means that people saving for a private pension get paid back money for every pound based on what level of tax they pay. \nThis means that for every £1 basic rate taxpayers put in pensions the government pays 20p back but higher rate taxpayers get 40p and 45p back. GETTY In total Mr Hammond needs to raise £325 million in 2018/19 and £645 million in 2019/20 \nBaroness Altmann, a leading pension expert who also served in David Cameron's government, warned that Mr Hammond's predecessor George Osborne had balked at hitting pension tax relief. \nShe said: “You have to remember that George Osborne was very nervous about this because it affects core Conservative voters. “It also potentially hits public sector workers so it can cause problems there. \n“So the Chancellor really does need to tread very carefully with this.\" \nBut she also accepted that “he does not have many options\" available to him.
