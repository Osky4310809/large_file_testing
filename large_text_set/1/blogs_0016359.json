Academy Award-winner Octavia Spencer just put her money where her mouth is, when it comes to inspiring tomorrow's greats.\nThe Hidden Figures star took to Instagram recently, letting her fans know that she'd joined in on the effort to send disadvantaged communities to see the film for free.\nSEE ALSO: Why 'Hidden Figures' — and its unsung heroes — is the ultimate NASA story\nThe actress who plays NASA genius Dorothy Vaughan in the film, bought out an entire cinema in L.A. so low-income families can watch the critically-acclaimed box office-smasher.\nTomorrow I've bought the 8pm showing of #hiddenfigures the rave Baldwin hills. If you know a family in need that would like to see our movie but can't afford it have them come. It's first come first served. My mom would not have been able to afford to take me and my siblings.

Honouring the true story of NASA experts that sent the first man into orbit? That's worth a whole lot more than a movie ticket — and it's a story these young people won't forget anytime soon.\nBONUS: The best and most underrated movies of 2016", "external_links": ["https://www.gofundme.com/hidden-figures-outing", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPMCLodA3Yq/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Mg12XEpF.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Mg12XEpF.m3u8", "https://www.gofundme.com/hidden-figures-triprdc%20"], "published": "2017-01-18T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T08:37:11.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
