Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian Elizabeth Watts Friday 13 January 2017 13.03   Share on Messenger Close \nA thud echoed through the house, as if something with purpose had landed in my porch. It had. The postie had delivered my score of Ligeti’s Le Grand Macabre . Let’s be clear about this: we’re not talking a thin, limp excuse for a score; we’re talking a chunky presence, an I-mean-business score that you have to make space for in your house, its bright yellow cover constantly demanding attention. Like an evil personal trainer, this score was going to take control of my life for weeks to come. Ligeti's riot through history | Tom Service Read more \nI have some experience with music that those of us in the business often naughtily refer to as “squeaky gate”. By that I mean music that doesn’t conform to the confines of harmony and tonality, like the classical music you hear when on hold to your favourite insurance company. I once attempted the feat of memorising an hour of Kurtág , a fine composer of this type of music, and the process nearly broke me. I surgically attached myself to a piano, lived off tea and biscuits for several days and spent three hours working on just one bar. Given the piece was settings of Kafka texts , perhaps this was all part of the intention. By the time I got to the last song – which was about 10 times longer than any other, had no time signature, was full of quarter tones and required a GCHQ code-breaker to read the rhythms – I was, to quote Spock, emotionally compromised . But I survived and lived to learn another score. ‘I was, to quote Spock, emotionally compromised. But I lived to learn another score.’ Elizabeth Watts Photograph: PR \nI opened the Ligeti and looked through the opera. I thought of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy . Not only because of the surreal world the work conjures up which cleverly cocks a snook at our own (but with more sex and swearing than Douglas Adams’s), but also because I thought it might be appropriate to write DON’T PANIC on the cover. \nSet in a absurdist land of despots, debauchery and drunkenness, Le Grand Macabre premiered in 1978. Its score is a riot of quotations and pastiche and a huge percussion section that includes “a duck-quacker”, a wind machine, a saucepan and a “large alarm clock”. Ligeti wasn’t sure his work could even be classed as an opera, and despising the then-trendy term anti-opera, Le Grand Macabre thus became the first – and possibly the last – anti-anti-opera. \nOn an initial assessment Ligeti’s work didn’t seem to promise total mental meltdown, but there were tricky patches. A patch of semiquavers may not seem too difficult for a woman who has conquered music written for Farinelli , but when you’re also looking at a tempo marking of 120 crotchets per minute things start to get interesting. I used an old trick of singing the notes staccato (very short) and then, with the help of a metronome, getting faster and faster until I was at the right speed. Only I never was. All that happened was that I ended up sounding like a crazed chimpanzee (and I should know, having recorded the vocalisations of the great apes in a former anthropological life). The only solution: more practice. And then, more practice. Repeat, repeat, repeat. You have to cut out the emotion because the frustration of not being able to get it right is self-defeating. Our characters were originally named Clitoria and Spermando. So, yes, sex is definitely the order of the day \nThen occasionally there was a longed-for eureka moment. There is one page where I sing the syllable “per” of per ish several times in different rhythms mostly in tones and semitones. The thrill of finally being able to do this was actually quite addictive. My husband put on earphones during the process. \nAlongside all of this technical note-learning is the matter of characterisation: thinking about my function in the piece and imagining different ways of perceiving the part. I don’t know what director Peter Sellars and conductor Sir Simon Rattle may end up wanting, but one starting point is my character’s name. Amanda is what’s written in the score, and my lover Amando (a mezzo) and I sing much of the music together, it being rather sensual in places. Then I learn that our characters were originally named Clitoria and Spermando . So, yes, sex is definitely the order of the day. \nAmong the detailed dynamics, articulations and complicated rhythms I try to add a layer of irresistible legato and lustful colour in my voice. For me, that’s the thing about “modern” music: trying to get down to the music; to communicate the meaning in a truthful, honest way, getting beyond the often terrifying dots on the page. I am no musicologist, and I leave the analysis of such great works as Le Grand Macabre in the hands of such experts as Tom Service , but to me, as well as the irreverent thrill of 12 car horns in the opening prelude, the use of an unconventional musical language helps to transport us into another world. Once transported it allows us to look back in on ourselves through a parallel universe. Ligeti’s absurd panoply of foul-mouthed tenors, dominatrix mezzos, hell-raising basses and weak countertenor politicians casts a light on our own absurdities. \nLigeti’s opera is an inexorable gallop towards the destruction of Breughelland (its setting), and it may be that the only thing that halts armageddon is a large amount of alcohol. Now there’s something we can all relate to. \nSo think of me, as I sip my medicinal glass of wine after a long day smashing notes out, not with pity for someone working hard to learn seemingly impossible music, but as someone with a mission to pick up a musical hitchhiker and transport them to another musical planet.
