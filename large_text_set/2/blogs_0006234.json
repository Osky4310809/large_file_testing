The song is the official anthem of the European Union. \nThe famous piece was composed by Beethoven in 1824 as part of his 9th Symphony and uses words from an earlier poem by Friedrich Schiller. It was adopted as the official EU anthem in 1972. All the MPs who voted in favour of the Government's Brexit bill \nA small group of SNP MPs began whistling the tune as the Commons voted on the crucial third reading of the Government’s European Union Bill. As other MPs joined in, the whistling developed into humming and then outright singing, with one MP even standing in front of the SNP benches to conduct their colleagues. \nThe bizarre choral protest led Lindsay Hoyle, the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, to intervene, yelling: “Order!” \nAddressing Patricia Gibson, the MP for North Ayrshire and Arran, he added: “Ms Gibson, it’s very good that you’re the choir but what I would say is, I personally don’t mind singing but I certainly can’t allow it in the Chamber.

It will now pass to the House of Lords. More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:25:03.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
