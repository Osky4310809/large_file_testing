When you consider the speed of sound is 1,263km/h, you can understand why they are referring to it as \"near-supersonic.\" \nThe new train, being called a hyper-tube train, is being developed at the Korea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI) in conjunction with Hanyang University and a number of other unannounced research groups. The initial goal is to allow travel between Seoul and Busan in half an hour. Currently that journey takes around two-and-a-half hours. \nThe hyper-tube train works by floating a pod inside a tube that is a near-vacuum. This drastically lowers friction and air resistance meaning travel can be much faster. For comparison, Maglev trains only reach 500km/h. \nIf this all sounds familiar, it's because you've probably heard it before under the name Hyperloop , which was initially proposed by Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX. This is just Korea's own take on the idea. Related Hyperloop One Teases 12-Minute Ride From Dubai to Abu Dhabi \nThere are many hurdles to overcome before such a high-speed train becomes a reality. Cost is a major concern, as is safety. When you are shooting down a tube at 1,000km/h you really need to have 100% confidence in the tech and infrastructure. If something goes wrong, it's going to go very wrong! \nWith that in mind, the South China Morning Post reports that KRRI isn't setting a launch date beyond \"the not-too-distant-future.\" However, the viability of the technology will be looked at \"over the next three years,\" suggesting a Korean hyper-tube train won't become a reality until at least the mid-2020s, and even that's optimistic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T15:34:03.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
