Gen. (Ret.) Michael Flynn as national security adviser. \nThe president has addressed both of these issues in recent days with plans to submit a new executive order tailored to address the court’s objections and the naming of Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster to replace Flynn. \nTrump told White House reporters at a press conference last week, that despite the headlines of many of their stories, the new administration is running well.

There’s zero chaos,” Trump said, referring to the plethora of negative stories. “We are running — this is a fine-tuned machine,” the president contended. \nHe continued: “We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done.” “This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my cabinet approved.” — President Trump pic.twitter.com/U8HZHa6mAq \n— CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) February 16, 2017 \nLewandowski agreed that the president has accomplished a lot in less than a month. \n“The president is implementing the promises he made on the campaign trail. Twenty-six executive orders signed into law. Four visits from foreign leaders already. He has nominated a Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy,” the former campaign manager told ABC News This Week host Jonathan Karl on Sunday. \nLewandowski also noted, “For the first time since October 2009, the right track, wrong track in the country is actually a positive that people think we’re actually going in the right direction.” \nAccording to Rasmussen Reports , nearly half of Americans believe the country is on the right track, which is the highest percentage since 2009.
