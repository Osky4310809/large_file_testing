Listen to “Chained To The Rhythm” here After a week of disco balls appearing in random locations around the world, Katy Perry has released her new single , “Chained To The Rhythm,” and it’s a woke reggae disco bop that we never knew we needed.\nWe reported earlier this week (February 7th) that rumors that Katy Perry was about to release a brand new song had begun to swirl. Things began to get exciting when the singer changed all her social media pictures and banners. She then announced that she was performing at the Grammys this Sunday (February 12th), and Billboard accidentally let slip that Perry would be performing her new single at the awards show.\nNew life who dis \nA photo posted by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Feb 6, 2017 at 6:52pm PST \nWell after some immense global teasing , Katy Perry has finally shared her new single “Chained To The Rhythm,” and it’s EVERYTHING. The track, which was co-written by Sia and co-produced by pop music maestro Max Martin, is a reggae tinged disco song (much in the vein of Ace of Base) featuring Skip Marley (Bob Marley’s grandson) that deals with waking up to the trouble that’s building in society. As Perry said in a tweet, this new era for her is about “Purposeful Pop.” \nWe gonna call this era Purposeful Pop. https://t.co/fCllqtlRTm \n— KATY PERRY (@katyperry) February 10, 2017 “Are we crazy?” Perry sings. “Living our lives through a lens/Trapped in our white picket fence/Like Ornaments/So comfortable, we’re living in a bubble.” The singer then goes on to suggest that people in society are “stumbling around like a wasted zombie.” \n@JessiAmbriz we can break the cycle, if we want to...\n— KATY PERRY (@katyperry) February 10, 2017 Katy Perry also shared the lyric video for the track, which cashes in on the tiny food trend that is everywhere on social media. The tiny food then gets fed to a hamster, and we’re pretty sure it’s a message about being force fed stuff by society, but WHO KNOWS!?\nWatch the video and listen to “Chained To The Rhythm” below.\nOver the past few years, Katy Perry has become what some might describe as “woke.” The singer was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton during the run up to the election, and was recently involved in a PSA taking a stand against anti-Muslim rhetoric. She was also recently awarded for her humanitarian work with UNICEF .\nIt’s unclear yet whether “Chained To The Rhythm” is the first taste from Perry’s upcoming fourth album. However, given that she’s also been sharing Instagram Stories of herself in the studio with what sounds like new music blaring in the background, we think it’s a safe bet to assume that an album will be out sooner rather than later!\nMeanwhile, you can stream and download “Chained To The Rhythm” on Spotify and on Apple Music .\nWatch Katy Perry perform at the 59th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday February 12th, on CBS at 8 p.m. EST/5 p.m. PST.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:19:15.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
