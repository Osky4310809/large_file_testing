But you’re not there to take in deliveries during the day and you don’t trust your good-for-nothing neighbours when it comes to taking in precious cargo. And as for getting the postman to leave boxes of wine by your bins…don’t even go there.\nDo video 'feasters' help or trigger those with eating issues? So you limp on, buying bottles of over-priced plonk from any off licenses you pass between the tube and your miserable, alcohol-free apartment.\nIf only wine bottles could be delivered through your letterbox, to be deposited safely on your doormat until you come back from the office.\nWell, my thirsty friend, you’re in luck.\nGarcon Wines is a London-based vintner who have invented a plastic wine bottle that squeezes through letterboxes.\n(Picture: Garcon Wines/BNPS Wine) The bottles have been flattened and made longer to be able to hold the standard 750ml, and Garcon Wines hopes to launch a subscription service in February.\nMore: Food How many calories are in your favourite gin? 18 gins ranked \nJust so you know, Monster Munch aren't meant to be claws \nThe size of your mug changes how your coffee tastes \nLong and slim, they look a bit like olive oil bottles, and come in postbox-friendly packages that are about the same size as contact lense boxes.\nPrices will start at £10 a month for one bottle, and plans can be cancelled at any time with discounts for multiple deliveries.\n&&&&& To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSo that means no more having to stay in for deliveries or having to schlep over to the depot with your ‘Missed Call’ card. Garcon Wines say they hope to begin shipping wines from March this year.\nApparently the wines that will be offered won’t be the kind that you’ll want to put in a cellar for years on end – the company says that you’ll need to drink them within six to 12 months.\nI’m sure that’s doable for most of us.\n(Picture: Facebook/Garcon Wines) Good bye depressing post.
