It’s not like you’re allowed to bring drinks from home through airport security… that is, until now. \nYes, really. Thanks to The Points Guy, we now know you can freeze your favorite drink before going through airport security and TSA will let you through. \nMy mind is blown. \nAccording to TSA’s rules , you’re allowed to bring your drinks through a security checkpoint at an airport as long as they’re frozen solid upon entering. \nHowever, if it’s beginning to melt in the slightest way, it won’t be allowed through because the liquid must meet the 3-1-1 requirements. \nThe exact rule from TSA’s website explains the specifications in detail: \nFrozen liquid items are allowed through the checkpoint as long as they are frozen solid when presented for screening. If frozen liquid items are partially melted, slushy, or have any liquid at the bottom of the container, they must meet 3-1-1 liquids requirements. \nHow excited are you guys?! Giphy \nThis means you can freeze your favorite drink from across the world and bring it with you on the plane ride home. Talk about a souvenir. \nThere are still a few things you should keep in mind if you plan on taking your favorite frozen drink through security, though. \nFor starters, make sure you’re aware how long you’ll be standing on line for. It’d be a total bummer if your drink melted before you get to the checkpoint. \nTo help solve that problem, you could always use an ice pack to keep your drink frozen solid, but if your ice pack melts before you make it to TSA, it won’t be allowed through. \nOf course, bringing your frozen drink through security doesn’t mean it won’t be screened or questioned further — especially if it appears to be hazardous. \nThat’s a no-brainer, though.
