There are only four more episodes left of This Is Us ‘s first season. And if you’re anything like us, you are already fretting about what could possibly fill the void that the Pearson family vacation will leave in your TV-viewing schedule and your heart until fall. One way to ease the pain is to follow the social (media) lives of the folks who play the family, as they are basically providing a second show with all the feels online. We’ve collected some of the cast’s best Twitter and Instagram moments to get you started. Related: Our This Is Us Recaps Milo Ventimiglia: “Jack” Superdad, meet superfan! On an early February night, Ventimiglia was filming with the teenage version of his onscreen kids in a Los Angeles neighborhood when he walked by and noticed some guy catching up on This Is Us through his big front window. He decided to drop by to thank him for watching and, of course, take a few photos. When your filming #ThisIsUs & the neighbors are watching… #ThisIsUs while you're filming #ThisIsUs !!! TONIGHT we're back!! 9/8c on @nbc MV pic.twitter.com/XPixJS1j8J \n— Milo Ventimiglia (@MiloVentimiglia) February 7, 2017 Mandy Moore: “Rebecca” Parents just don’t understand. Both Moore’s real-life mom and dad had some kind and harsh words about last week’s episode and her character’s lingering desire to hit the road after her husband’s big romantic gesture to save them from the same fate as Shelly and Miguel. Sterling K. Brown: “Randall” One of the show’s greatest moments so far was when Jack took part in the dad-son push-ups ritual with a young Randall at the martial arts class he’d enrolled him in as a way to meet more people who looked like him — and to reiterate that Jack will always have his adopted son’s back. One of the greatest moments IRL was when Brown proved he was just as committed to his onscreen dad (and brother)! \n— Sterling K Brown (@sterlingkb1) November 30, 2016 Brown also proved his commitment to fans when he posted an apology for missing his live-tweeting duties because his infant son Amare’s sleep schedule made his life as unpredictable as his character’s. \n— Sterling K Brown (@sterlingkb1) January 25, 2017 Chrissy Metz: “Kate” Stars, they’re just like us! Metz has never said no to a good time with a Snapchat filter. Justin Hartley: “Kevin” Kevin usually keeps his emotions locked, but Justin Hartley has no problem sharing his joy and pain with the people. And just as on the show, some situations are happy and sad simultaneously, like when his beloved pet passed away. But that meant he got to rescue two new furry friends. Presley,You were the sweetest animal I ever met. Made me laugh every day. I'll celebrate you forever! \n— Justin Hartley (@justinhartley) December 13, 2016 Baths and haircuts. Looks like I'm now the only one left that needs to go to the groomer. Pulling it together now. pic.twitter.com/rUcLpcmZOR \n— Justin Hartley (@justinhartley) December 30, 2016 Like his character, though, he does like to goof around with his bro. \n— Justin Hartley (@justinhartley) October 31, 2016 Chris Sullivan: “Toby” You should monitor Sullivan’s account for his wild fashion choices alone. (That People’s Choice Awards ensemble, though!) If you need another reason, he and Metz have more fun together than Kate and Toby. Like that time they practiced ugly crying. \n— Chris Sullivan (@SullivanTweet) November 15, 2016 Susan Kelechi Watson: “Beth” Watson clearly believes knowledge is power as she promised to “learn something new everyday” of Black History Month, which she in turn tries to share with her followers. But sometimes, you get (old) schooled by unlikely sources. Lessons learned from #NewEditionBET 1. Always read ur contract2. Don't come for #JohnnyGill 3. Casting is everything \n— Susan Kelechi Watson (@skelechiwatson) January 27, 2017 Jon Huertas: “Miguel” Poor Miguel. Everyone is mean to him. Kevin never lets him play Pilgrim Rick. Kate rolls her eyes at him. Randall is annoyed when he and his mom just pop by unannounced. Even Jon Huertas’s adorable pup Bruno thinks he’s shady for ending up with his best friend’s girl.

This is the look he gave me… #ThisIsUs #mansbestfriend #teammiguel pic.twitter.com/3f94QJDZ3M \n— Jon Huertas (@Jon_Huertas) November 16, 2016 Dan Fogelman: Creator, writer, executive producer That time that the cast was just as surprised and happy to get the news that NBC ordered two more seasons before the first one was even completed. This is Us getting the good news!!! #ThisIsUs pic.twitter.com/pOJpqvTbPH \n— Dan Fogelman (@Dan_Fogelman) January 19, 2017 This Is Us airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on NBC.
