Krikorian also claimed Puzder would “put Americans last” when it comes to labor policy. \nPuzder appeared to be dismissing the report Monday night with a tweet expressing his anticipation of his upcoming Senate confirmation hearing. I am looking forward to my hearing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:40:44.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
