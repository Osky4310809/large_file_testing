B’nai Brith Canada said it had notified Calgary Police. The incident comes amid concerns over rising hate crimes, including Holocaust denial posters at the University of Calgary.\nChabloz allegedly posted a mocking song about the Holocaust on YouTube last year, prompting the charity Campaign Against Anti-Semitism to take action in the U.K. courts.\nShe has denied the allegations.\nAccording to a post on the Facebook page of white nationalist Paul Fromm she is on an eight-city tour of Canada that began last Friday in London, Ont.\n“This news is particularly unnerving during a week when swastikas were found at York University (in Toronto), and Chabloz is scheduled to speak in Calgary tonight — just days after Calgary‘s Jewish Community Center was evacuated due to bomb threats,” said Avi Benlolo, president and CEO of the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.\nThe Canada Border Services Agency said it would not speak about specific cases but that it took its “border and national security responsibilities very seriously.”\nRelated ‘There are certain battles that you can’t turn away from’: Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt on truth vs lies Police eject Holocaust denier , 87, as trial begins for one of the last Nazis, a former Auschwitz guard, 94 Jim Keegstra, Holocaust denier who took hate speech battle to Supreme Court, dead at 80 Ottawa human rights lawyer Richard Warman, who first raised concerns about her visit, said Chabloz should be removed from Canada if she was not forthright with immigration authorities.\n“By referring to Auschwitz as a ‘theme park’ and the gas chambers as a ‘hoax,’ British Holocaust denier Alison Chabloz has earned her place at the very margins of society,” said Martin Sampson, communications director of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs.\n“Her ignorance would be laughable but for the pain her lies cause our survivor community and their descendants,” he said. “Her views are repugnant and I am surprised she gained entry into Canada.”\nNational Post \n• Email: sbell@nationalpost.com | Twitter: @StewartBellNP \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:40:25.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
