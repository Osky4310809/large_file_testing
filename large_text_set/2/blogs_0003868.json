On Sunday, Mandy Moore posted a sweet selfie with her onscreen love interest Shane West and the director Adam Shankman, who also shared his own picture on Instagram. \"Welp. These 2 gentlemen are still some of the best around,\" she captioned the snap. \"Loved catching up with ya, @theshanewest and @adamshankman. My ‚ù§ is full. #awalktoremember #reunion.\" This isn't the first time Moore and West have made us emotional over the movie's anniversary. Aside from posting a number of throwback shots on social media, they recently opened up about their most memorable moments on set , in which the This Is Us star admitted to kind of, sort of, falling in love with her costar while filming. I mean, do you blame her? Hopefully Moore and Shankman will share more pictures from their reunion soon!
