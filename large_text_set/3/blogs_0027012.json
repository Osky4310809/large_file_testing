Seven Pittsburgh firefighters suffered injuries, including burns and broken bones, after rescuing an 86-year-old woman. \nPITTSBURGH — Fire department officials in western Pennsylvania say more training is planned after a review of actions at a New Year’s Day blaze in suburban Pittsburgh last year in which five firefighters jumped out of a second-story window. \nThe Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire released a report Tuesday on an after-action review of the blaze in Wilkinsburg. An 86-year-old woman was rescued, but five firefighters had to jump from windows, and one of them struck two other firefighters. \nA public safety spokeswoman said more training will focus on “improving decision-making when it comes to bailing out of a burning structure.” \nRecommendations also included sessions on “reading smoke” and proper ventilation, radio communications, multi-casualty procedures and group sessions on issues such as “stress-induced tunnel vision.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:57:28.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
