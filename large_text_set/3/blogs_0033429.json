Never running from a real fight, she is the one named Sailor Moon fan club member! Okay, so that’s a little different than the dubbed opening song you probably remember. But it works, right? Got your attention? Good, because you’re going to want in on this. The official Sailor Moon fan club is now opening for a second round of English applications. That means you can join!\nLast spring, the Pretty Guardians, the Japanese-administered Sailor Moon fan club, opened registrations that were good for one year. Pretty Guardians is about to star recruiting a whole new group of members this time around, and if you consider yourself a true Moonie, you’re going to want to go ahead and join.\nIf you do, you get a numbered membership card with an illustration of Princess Serenity. You also get a swath of cool swag like a necklace that looks like Sailor Moon’s Crescent Moon Wand. If this is your second year in the club and you want to renew your membership, you’ll get a Sailor Moon stationery set. It’s actually a reproduction of one given out to subscribers of the Nakayoshi manga anthology when Sailor Moon was in its infancy, serialized in the pages of the magazine.\nYou also get a quarterly newsletter, access to members-only merchandise, opportunities to go to special fan events, and plenty of other goodies that only members get to use. It costs $50 to join the club for a year, and it will run from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. Applications will be accepted from all over the world, including the US, Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Australia, and even Singapore.\nIf you’re a true Sailor Moon fan, you’re just going to have to bite the bullet and become a card-carrying “official” fan going forward, or we’re just not going to be able to accept you in our coven. Just kidding. It’s still an awesome club to join. I’m going to do it myself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:16:20.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
