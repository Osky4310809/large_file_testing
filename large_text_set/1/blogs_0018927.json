Developers behind the plan got the necessary zoning variance project but were unable to proceed. \nPearl Companies , of Indianapolis, is behind the new proposal for the site formerly occupied by a lumberyard. Brad Richey, a company principal, said Friday that he was aware of neighborhood opposition to the earlier plan. His company’s proposal includes garage parking and commercial space, elements lacking in the previous plan, he said. \nPearl’s $20 million proposal is for 100-market rate apartments, compared with 63 units in the earlier, failed proposal. \nThe new proposal includes nearly 15,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space that would probably include a restaurant. Garage parking would fill the remainder of the floor and an underground level with 123 parking spaces. Richey said Pearl had the site under contract. \nHe said Pearl’s project would have a different appearance than the earlier proposal even though St. Louis architect Joe Klitzing designed both. \nKlitzing’s design for Pearl includes a broad sidewalk on the Clayton Avenue side of the building and a garage parking entrance around the corner on Graham Street. \nPearl representatives are scheduled to present their plan next week to members of the Clayton-Tamm Community Association. The neighborhood meeting is set for 7:30 p.m. Thursday at St. James the Greater School.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T03:53:44.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
