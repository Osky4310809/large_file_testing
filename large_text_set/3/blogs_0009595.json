She receives a total of 45 ml of Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) oil along with the feeds in order to meet her calorie values. \nIt is said that at present her total calorie intake is approximately 1,750 kcals and total protein intake is 200 gms. \nDoctors hope Eman who is currently on post-operative care will lose another 200 kg during the course of 6-8 months so that she can sit up. \nEman will return to her hometown within few weeks and her weight loss progress will be tracked by the team of doctors. \nFirst Published: Saturday, March 11, 2017 - 08:53 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T07:36:53.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
