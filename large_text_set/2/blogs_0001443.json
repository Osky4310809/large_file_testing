First Budweiser kowtows to snowflakes by running a Super Bowl ad implying that being shitty to immigrants is wrong, and now even Hooters has fallen prey to the PC cultural agenda by opening restaurants whose themes don’t revolve around objectifying the person bringing you plates of fried food. The death of the red-blooded American male has a name, and that name is Hoots. \nThe Tampa Bay Times has details on the new fast-casual chain, which will feature an abbreviated one-page menu revolving around Hooters’ famous chicken wings (which The A.V.
