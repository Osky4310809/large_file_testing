New Device Guarantees to Teach You to Play Guitar in 60 Seconds It's called Fret Zeppelin, demonstration video available. UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 2 hours ago 0 \nAn interesting new guitar gizmo called Fret Zeppelin is 5 days away from wrapping up quite a successful Kickstarter campaign. \nComing with a slogan of \"Play Guitar in 60 Seconds,\" the device is a LED-driven system that highlights the frets that should be pressed for various chords and songs. \nIt is operated via iOS or Android app, offering a selection of chords and fingerings, along with custom songs, tunings and improvisation techniques. \nThe company noted: \"Many want to learn to play, but don't ever get there due to time constraints, cost of lessons, and struggling to learn proper technique on their own. Fret Zeppelin replaces frustration with fun, giving players a digital learning tool right on the neck of their guitar.\" \nAt the moment, the gizmo reeled in almost $170,000 via Kickstarter , easily smashing the initial goal of $48,000. You can check out the demonstration video below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:29:49.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
