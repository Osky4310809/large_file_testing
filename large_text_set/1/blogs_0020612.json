I was just like : ‘I can’t do this.’ \n“She broke my waters at 8.30pm and a tiny trickle came out and the pain trebled. Finley shot out 20 minutes later and I couldn’t stop shaking from the shock.\" The happy couple welcomed Finley two weeks ago Rebekah described her latest labour as \"agony\" (Photo: Will Johnston Photography/PA) \nThe couple also open up in the magazine - out now - about how Finley required an incubator because of jaundice and imbalanced sugar levels. \nTheir interview came after Rebekah was trolled with vile tweets about little Finley, including one that wished he'd been stillborn. That disgusting tweet was posted beneath Rebekah's recent comment about Finley turning two weeks old. \nA source told The Sun : \"Becky is used to getting trolled and can give as good as she gets when the abuse is about football or attacking her personally, but when it’s about her children she takes it very seriously. \n\"She is a ferociously protective mother and her children are everything to her, she will not tolerate this kind of abuse and has been advised to report him to the police as trolling is now illegal.” \nA rep for the WAG added: “Becky is absolutely disgusted with this horrible man. Football banter on Twitter is one thing but to say that about a new born baby is evil and I hope that Twitter deals with him accordingly.” Rebekah shared this snap of her post pregnancy body last week (Photo: Instagram) \nMeanwhile, Rebekah shared a picture last week of her post-pregnancy stretch mark in a bid to show how having a baby changes your body. \nShe took to Instagram to post before and after snaps, showing herself as heavily pregnant and revealing the stretch marks left behind. \nKeen to send out a strong message, she wrote: \"Our bodies go through so many changes growing a baby, it's not easy it's tough on women! The trauma of childbirth, the sleep deprivation that follows, the ups and downs! We never fully recover! Learn to love the wrinkly skin, the stretch marks, the deflated once perky boobs... Perfection doesn't exist... it's just an illusion! Imperfection is beautiful! #nofilter #childbirth#pregnancy #reality #imperfection#postbabybody\" Becky was praised for her strong message about body confidence \nFans praised her for the image and the message behind it. \nOne wrote: \"You should take on a job for standing up and speaking about women what we go through and how we should cope with this you speak highly about women\" \nAnd another complimented her, saying: \"You look bloody amazing for only having bubs 2 weeks ago!!!\" \nLeicester City and England footballer Jamie, announced the arrival of their second child together on Twitter. \nHe wrote: \"Over the moon to announce the arrival of our gorgeous little boy on Sunday evening! Mummy and baby doing great! @RebekahVardy #blessed.\" \nRebekah has two children, Megan, 11, and six-year-old Taylor, from previous relationships. \nFootballer Jamie has a six-year-old daughter Ella with his ex Emma Daggett. \nThey are both also parents to Sofia, 22 months.
