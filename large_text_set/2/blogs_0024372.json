Not that we even own ball gowns.) But since the world is a little different, we need to be a little more pragmatic. This is why wardrobe basics are so needed. Basics may not be as glamorous as bold, statement pieces, but they are the foundation of a versatile, stylish wardrobe. And because, you would be a fool not to take advantage of a crisp white shirt, a perfectly hanging t-shirt, a pair of great jeans, a structured sweatshirt or shoes that won't make your toes deeply unhappy! \nYou see, basics are the potatoes of fashion. They're easy and you can do a million things with them. But who like bland potatoes? A little masala is always good! The key is knowing just how to style them. Here's how to keep your basics in the not-so-basic territory! 1. Make sure the fit is right \nFor basics, it is quite important that they do not look shabby. A good fit is quite important. And even if the item in question is oversized, make sure it is done tastefully. 2. Pay attention to detail \nLittle details matter. Simply folding your jeans or the sleeves on your tees adds a bit more attitude to a basic outfit. \n3. Accessories rule the showAccessories are the Holy Grail when it comes to uplifting any kind of outfit right away. Throw on a scarf, a belt or some jewellery to add to your basics. 4. Let the shoes talk \nShoes add personality to your whole look. So if your outfit is basic, make sure your shoes are not! 5. One basic at a time \nToo many basics together make for a dull outfit. Pair your basics with statement pieces, like a sequined skirt or embroidered pants to mix things up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:28:33.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
