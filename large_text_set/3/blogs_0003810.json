The gunman allegedly shouted \"Go Back to Your Country\" while attacking the 39-year-old Indian. \nIn a span of 10 days, this was the third time Indians were attacked in suspected cases of \"hate crime\" in the United States. HOW ARE INDIAN LEADERS REACTING TO THE ATTACKS: \"Since the number of Indians studying, working, living in the US is very large, such incidents are causing a situation of panic amongst their family members living in India,\" Mamata Banerjee wrote. She requested the Union minister to see that \"the matter is taken up at the highest level\" so that such incidents do not recur and that Indians living in the US feel \"safe, secure and worry-free\". Earlier on Sunday, Mamata had tweeted, \"Two more shocking killings of Indians in the US. GoI must take this up with the US govt on an urgent basis\". Last month, a 32-year-old Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla was shot dead in Kansas by a US Navy veteran who allegedly yelled \"Get Out of My Country\" before opening fire. An Indian-origin businessman Harnish Patel (43) was found dead with gunshot wounds in the front yard of his home on Thursday. Condoling the death of Harnish Patel, Sushma Swaraj tweeted, \"I am pained to hear about the killing of Harnish Patel, a US national of Indian origin in Lancaster, South Carolina. Our Consul has reached Lancaster and met the family of Harnish Patel. The investigation of the case is in progress\". Reacting to the attack on a Sikh man in Kent, Washington, Swaraj said, \"I have spoken to Sardar Harpal Singh, father of the victim. He told me that his son had a bullet injury on his arm. He is out of danger and is recovering in a private hospital\". \nALSO READ:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T16:28:50.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
