But as of Saturday, the once-popular retailer has closed all 250 of its locations. This news came hot on the heels of Macy’s announcing it was shuttering 68 stores , and Sears stating it would be closing 160 locations (108 of those being Kmart stores). The Limited Will Continue to Operate Online \nFor those who still shop at The Limited, not all is lost. A message on the company’s website states that it will continue to sell items online. But only time (and sales) will tell how long that will last. So shop, shop, shop, especially because right now, everything is 50 percent off! \nIt would seem that the convenience of buying all things online (hi, Amazon) continues to play a part in the extinction of more and more brick-and-mortar stores. Fast-fashion houses like Forever 21 , Zara and H&M also are also to blame. Who will be up next on the chopping block. Rumors seem to point to Claire’s .
