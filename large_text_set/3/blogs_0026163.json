Samoylova said she still hopes to perform at Eurovision in Kiev. \n“It is very funny to watch [the situation] from the sidelines, because I don’t understand what they have seen in me. They have seen some kind of threat in me, in such a little girl. By and large, I’m not feeling down. I keep on practicing, as for some reason I believe that everything can still change,” the singer said, as cited by TASS news agency.

Kiev says Samoylova did not request permission from the Ukrainian authorities to enter the peninsula, in violation of Ukrainian law. \nThe SBU announcement was met by a wave of indignation from Russian officials, lawmakers and music industry professionals. \nMaria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, highlighted what she described as the hypocrisy with which Kiev insists that the law should apply to everybody, while at the same time undermining this rule by imposing restrictions on Russian media and allowing vandalism toward Russian banks. \nREAD MORE: Russia announces last-minute entry for Eurovision in Ukraine, ending boycott rumors \n“For some reason, this principle has been invoked on the territory of Ukraine only in respect to the Russian singer. In respect to other people, including Ukrainian citizens, Kiev does not intend to show any adherence to principles,” Zakharova said, adding that the way Europe reacts to the ban on Samoylova will show its true face.
