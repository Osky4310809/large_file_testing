Close The Young Mummy shares the reality of parenthood UP NEXT \nJust days after she was targeted by anti-vaxxers for immunising Florence, the mum has hit back, saying their behaviour is disgusting. Sophie has had enough of being bullied by other women over her parenting. Photo: Instagram/theyoungmummy \n“It’s something that I don’t normally let get to me, but there’s only so much someone can take,” Sophie told The Morning Show . \n“I’ve had extremes – on one hand I’ve had anti-vaxxers criticise me for immunising my child and on the other side I’ve had women tearing me to shreds on social media.\" With over 200,000 followers on Instagram, Sophie has shared intimate details - including live streaming her daughter Florence's birth - with the world. Photo: Instagram/theyoungmummy \nWith her husband Jaryd by her side, the overwhelmed mum has decided to speak out claiming although she makes the choice to share intimate details of her family, that doesn’t make it okay for people to say whatever they want. \n“They can just get so personal. It’s really nasty and it’s bullying,” she said. “They use the excuse ‘I’m entitled to my opinion’ but I think an opinion is much different to using disgusting and derogatory language towards someone. That’s actually just being nasty and bullying.\" Sophie and husband Jaryd have spoken out together against the bullying against the popular blogger. Photo: Instagram/theyoungmummy \nThe 26-year-old, who admits she’s guilty of aiming negative comments towards others as well having stood “on both sides of the bullying fence”, now refuses to accept that kind of behaviour – especially from other normal mums. \n“I've been thinking about the ladies who were teeing off on me on Facebook the other day,” she captioned a recent Instagram post. \n“How would they feel if their daughters came to them and showed a group conversation of fellow girls at their school speaking about her like that? Using the same language they used towards me. How would they feel reading similar insults about their daughter from strangers? Would they say to her 'suck it up princess, everyone's entitled to their opinion' like they said to me? No.” The mum has slammed others who post 'disgusting' comments about how she decides to parent her young family. Photo: Instagram/theyoungmummy \nDespite the bullies, Sophie is refusing to let the comments detract her from moving onwards and upwards when it comes to her six-week-old daughter Florence and Bobby, two. \n“I’m launching a new kids product in June this year, it’s a product I struggled to find when I had my first born… it’s been in the works for over two years now,\" she told The Morning Show . \"We’re trying to get it perfect at the moment., that’s all I’ll share for the time being.\" Close Mum on pain meds forgets her baby UP NEXT VIDEO Mum on pain meds forgets her baby Mum on pain meds forgets her baby \nWant more celebrity, entertainment and lifestyle news?
