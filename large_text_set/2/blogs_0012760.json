They falsely claimed they had seen the gun tucked into his waistband shortly after someone had claimed they were threatened at gunpoint, the DA's office said. \nThey were indicted Thursday for lying about these details to officials and in written documents, according to the DA's office. \nThe false statements were written in a search warrant application used to justify the seizure of the firearm, according to the District Attorney's office, while Cordoba repeated that version of events in a criminal complaint and before a grand jury, leading to the man's indictment. \nBut prosecutors discovered their account was false after combing through interviews, surveillance video, and text messages between Desormeau and someone else, the DA's office said. \nInstead, the officers had illegally searched the man's apartment and seized the weapon inside, according to the indictment of the two officers. \nDesormeau was indicted on one count of offering a false instrument for filing and one count of official misconduct. \nCordoba was indicted on two counts of offering a false instrument for filing and one count of official misconduct, and has also been charged with perjury and making a punishable written false statement for lying in a criminal complaint and before a grand jury. \nThe officers were arrested in the District Attorney's Office in Manhattan's 5th Precinct on Thursday morning and were arraigned that afternoon. The DA's office announced their indictment shortly thereafter. \nInformation on the officers' attorneys was not immediately available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:22:02.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
