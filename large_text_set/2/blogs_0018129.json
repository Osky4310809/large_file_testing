We’re iFun4all and we’re super excited to announce that our wacky, fast-paced stealth game, Serial Cleaner will be making its way onto your favourite console! Working on this game has been a blast, and we want to share some of the things that make it unique with you today!\nSerial Cleaner’s premise is simple – you’re a professional cleaner, the guy who’s tasked with taking care of the mess left after mafia shootouts and other, more gruesome killings. Your job is to remove the evidence from the scene – bodies, murder weapons, and blood – so that nobody can connect the crime to your clients. The police force is on the scene as you move through it, but luckily this is the 1970s, and most cops aren’t too motivated and won’t pursue you to the ends of the Earth. Don’t think this is going to be easy, though, as a single mistake can lead to your arrest and questioning, putting a black mark on your career!\n\nIn essence, the idea of Serial Cleaner came from dynamic, lose-fast/reload-fast games that demand that you retry a level several times to learn how enemies react, and figure out which zones of the map are safest. Each time you are caught, the level restarts, but elements of it will get randomised, ensuring that you can’t rely on just muscle memory to get through a stage!\nThe Cleaner is resourceful, but he’s also got years of experience under his belt – his trademark Cleaner Sense allows you to have a look at each location from a bird’s eye view, and figure out how best to proceed. The game is tough, but fair, so plan your moves right, or just get in there and improvise: both approaches are valid!\n\nSerial Cleaner includes a fleshed-out story campaign that takes you inside the 1970s, a decade of funky music, disco dancing, crazy haircuts, outta-sight clothes… and serial killers. Join the Cleaner as he takes missions from the mafia and a new, mysterious Client, whose influence will put our anti-hero in harm’s way. Learn new tricks and escape new enemy types that are added into the mix as you progress through the story, and see the game change as it modifies your experience based on real-world data! Then check out one of our many Challenge Modes to see if you can beat your friends’ score while playing under a different set of rules!\nWe haven’t yet mentioned the game’s unique, angular artstyle, and a 70s-inspired soundtrack full of beats to make you bounce in your seats. Expect to hear a lot of funk, mixed with disco, hard rock and smooth tunes to soothe the soul. Add to that unlockable alternative clothing and movie-inspired bonus levels, and you’ve got yourself one groovy package! Can you dig it?\n\nIf you are lucky enough to be going to EGX Rezzed come and say hello and try Serial Cleaner for yourselves! Hopefully see you there!\nThe post Destroy active crime scene evidence this summer in PS4 stealth game Serial Cleaner appeared first on PlayStation.Blog.Europe .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:30:55.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
