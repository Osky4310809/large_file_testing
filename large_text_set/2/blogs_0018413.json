Do you think Tim Cook ever gets bored of winning? \nApple stock has long been a great investment, but things have been looking particularly rosy since the company’s impressive latest quarterly earnings figures , which showed incredibly strong holiday iPhone sales and a booming Services division. \nPrior to closing time yesterday, Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty issued a note to clients in which she raised her target price for Apple from $150 to $154. \nThe reason?
