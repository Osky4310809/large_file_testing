But what would Ghostbusters be without Twinkies? Twin Peaks without pie? Goonies without Baby Ruth? Pixar without Pizza Planet? One artist has decided to celebrate this crucial link in a very unique way.

Here are just a few of our favorites from this show. We’re pretty sure you’ll get them all instantly. \nAnd that’s just the start. The show will also feature pieces based on food from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Simpsons (a lot of Simpsons , actually), Ghostbusters, Pulp Fiction, Spongebob Squarepants, Lost, and many more.

Online sales will start on January 28 and the show remains open until February 11. \nAnd yes, this being Fictional Food 2 , there was a Fictional Food 1 , much of which is still on sale.
