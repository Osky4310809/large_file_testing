There is also an understanding with Celtic that they will let him go when the time is right. \nBoss Brendan Rodgers persuaded Dembele to move to Scotland to get regular football and they only had to pay £500,000 for him last summer, so a big-money to Chelsea would represent a fantastic piece of business for the Glasgow side.

Costa has stayed for now, but Chelsea are eyeing up long-term replacements (Photo: Getty) \nThe 24-year-old Spain striker, who was also a target last summer when Costa was being pursued for a return to Atletico Madrid, understood to be open to a switch with doubts over his place at the Bernabeu. \nDutch centre-half van Dijk is in demand, with Man City also keen, and Southampton are bracing themselves for the latest in a long line of star departures. \nChelsea will have big money to spend if Costa does go to China, having already cashed in on midfielder Oscar with his stunning £60m switch to the Chinese Super League side Shanghai SIPG in December.
