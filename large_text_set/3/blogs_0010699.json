For the longest time, it has brought injustice to our people,” Duterte said, adding that he is willing to step down from his post if a federal system of government is adopted. \nThe President said he noticed during the campaign that no lawmaker was talking about problems in Mindanao, which strengthened his belief that a federal system of government is necessary. \n“We can bring peace to Mindanao with federalism,” Duterte said.   \nAmong those who took their oath were Cabinet members, congressmen, governors and mayors. \nParty president Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III reported to Duterte that PDP-Laban is leading the campaign for federalism, which is one of the ideologies being advocated by the party. \n“We will be holding a summit on federalism to come out with a mode of federal government for the country,” Pimentel said. \nHe said that the party is now mobilizing its political machinery nationwide in preparation for the 2019 midterm elections. \nPimentel said PDP-Laban would be fielding a complete slate of candidates from senators to mayors nationwide. \nHe also reminded those who want to join the party that PDP-Laban would no longer be accepting new members. \n“We will be shutting our doors once the PDP train will start moving,” he said. \nBenito Ranque, PDP-Laban founding member, said the party founded by former senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr. in 1982 has finally attained its political objective in having a President, Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives. \n“This is the ultimate objective of the party, to take the lead in promoting and supporting the advocacy of President Duterte against illegal drugs and federalism,” Ranque said. \nHe said this year the theme of the party’s anniversary is “No to Drugs, Yes to Federalism.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:54:11.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
