Cricket Australia have got to start saying ‘listen if things don’t improve we will stop with the invites’,” Chappell was quoted as saying by ESPN. \n“You can’t continue to [play poor] cricket. You can’t bowl poorly, have conservative field placings and field sloppily and expect to play decent cricket in Australia,” he added. \nThe flamboyant all-rounder also praised Mohammad Hafeez’s captaincy —who captained the side in the absence of Azhar Ali— and also applauded performances of Junaid Khan and Shoaib Malik.
