Photo by Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net \nAsi Taulava has signified his intention to remain with NLEX after reconsidering his trade demands, an executive confirmed on Tuesday. \nRoad Warriors team manager Ronald Dulatre shared that the 2003 PBA Most Valuable Player and the team have already settled their differences after holding a meeting with the management and coach Yeng Guiao on Monday. \n“When I met him, that’s his first option – to stay. Then we met coach Yeng yesterday after practice and he told us he will be staying,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT \nUsed sparingly under the new system Guiao installed in NLEX, Taulava has voiced his frustrations over his diminished role. \nBut the turn of the year seemed to have changed the 43-year-old’s mind, now armed with a renewed sense of motivation to help NLEX, which sits at the cellar with a 1-5 record this 2017 PBA Philippine Cup. \n“Basically, that’s his frustration. He wants to contribute more to the team, but he cannot because he’s not yet recovered 100-percent from his previous injuries,” said Dulatre. \nTaulava has had his fair share of injuries this conference, which also contributed to his dip on minutes with the Road Warriors. \nAlready dealing with a bruised heel, the Fil-Tongan center also battled with migraine and was forced to sit out NLEX’s 107-97 loss to Rain or Shine last December 23. \nWith the parties now in sync, NLEX, Guiao, and Taulava could are looking to move on from this debacle and come up with a late push to the playoffs this new year. \n“(Taulava) just wants to be 100-percent in shape and try help our team more. And coach Yeng is much willing to find other ways for him to contribute. Coach Yeng added, though, that he needs to accept his role in the team,” said Dulatre. \nNLEX springs back to action on Saturday against TNT in Angeles City, Pampanga.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T14:25:13.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
