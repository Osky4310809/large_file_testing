File photo \nMANILA, Philippines – President Duterte has deferred ordering the release of funds for the increase in the pension of Social Security System (SSS) members until his office finds a workable compromise to prevent the eventual bankruptcy of the agency. \n“With the impasse at the SSS, we had a long debate but the economic managers are having their doubts and they want to talk about it again. I promise it will come your way before the year ends. I am very sorry but that is how it is. I do not own the money,” the President said over state-run PTV 4. \n“The problem here is that the government assured everybody that SSS will remain solvent at all times,” he said, noting that the guarantee requires the government to shoulder the burden should anything go wrong with the funding. \nFor now, Duterte is not amenable to using taxpayers’ money, especially of non-SSS members, should there be a misstep in the implementation of the increase in SSS pensions. \n“That’s the problem. It is not the fault of the entire country. I would really give in but the memo of (Finance Sec. Carlos) Dominguez, (Budget Secretary) Ben Diokno and (Economic Development Sec. Ernesto) Pernia – they had a very bleak assessment of what’s in store for us in the days ahead and the risk is not really that good,” the President pointed out. \nDuterte said he needed to address the issue because there have been many calls seeking for updates on the matter.   \nHis administration, he added, is seeking for an alternative, win-win solution to solve the impasse. \n“Let us give them (members) the best we can,” he said.
