Ms Sturgeon said: “Is Scotland content for our future to be dictated by an increasingly right-wing Westminster Government with just one MP here – or is it better that we take our future into our own hands? It is becoming ever clearer that this is a choice that Scotland must make.” Watch | Sturgeon: Hard Brexit not in interests of Scotland 01:35 \nB usinesses and opposition politicians have warned against a new vote, and the polls do not favour another referendum, but Ms Sturgeon's predecessor Alex Salmond predicted last week that a new referendum could be held as early as autumn 2018, in order to have a vote before the UK leaves the EU. \nThe First Minister welcomed the ruling that Article 50 could not be triggered without an Act of Parliament and said her MPs would seek to work with others in the House of Commons to “stop the march towards a hard Brexit in its tracks”. \nShe also described the outcome as a “damning indictment of a UK Government that believed it could press on towards a hard Brexit with no regard to Parliament whatsoever”. \nMs Sturgeon said in her statement that it was vital that Westminster was now given the “fullest possible opportunity” to debate the triggering of Article 50 and the terms of the UK's negotiating position. \nShe added: “We are obviously disappointed with the Supreme Court's ruling in respect of the devolved administrations and the legal enforceability of the Sewel Convention. \n“It is now crystal clear that the promises made to Scotland by the UK Government about the Sewel Convention and the importance of embedding it in statute were not worth the paper they were written on. \n“Although the court has concluded that the UK Government is not legally obliged to consult the devolved administrations, there remains a clear political obligation to do so. Indeed, the court itself notes the importance of Sewel as a political convention.” \nShe said that regardless of the Supreme Court ruling, the Scottish Government would bring forward a Legislative Consent Motion and ensure that the Scottish Parliament had the opportunity to vote on whether or not it agrees to the triggering of Article 50. \nRuth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, said the SNP had been using the court case “to hold the UK to ransom”, and the party must now say whether it wanted Britain’s negotiations to succeed or fail. \nShe added: \"All parties should now respect the ruling that the court has given. Yet typically, Nicola Sturgeon has decided to ignore it by stating - even before the verdict was in - that she would still seek a separate vote at Holyrood. \n“Whatever side people were on last year, Scotland wants to get on with the negotiations so we can start to leave the uncertainty of the last few years behind us. We have all had enough of the nationalists using every diversionary tactic they can to try to use Brexit to manufacture a case for separation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T14:07:00.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
