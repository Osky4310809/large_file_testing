But anyone who's seen the movie knows this was the right call. Shannon's work as a no-B.S. investigator was a standout.\" \nA Fantastic Surprise for Lead Actor \n\" Viggo Mortensen is a minor upset for Captain Fantastic , but he got the SAG nom and Golden Globe nom as well. More people should see his wonderful performance. Stream it now! He got the vote over Tom Hanks ( Sully ), Joel Edgerton ( Loving ) and Michael Keaton ( The Founder ).\" \nJustin Timberlake Is on His Way to an EGOT \nThe singer-actor already has multiple Emmys and Grammys, and he now has a Best Original Song Oscar nod for “Can’t Stop the Feeling” in Trolls . \"He'll vie against Sting ('The Empty Chair,' in Jim: The James Foley Story ), Lin-Manuel Miranda ('How Far I’ll Go,' in Moana ) and maestros Benji Pasek and Justin Paul (two-time nominees for La La Land with 'Audition (The Fools Who Dream)’ and 'City of Stars'). This is a stacked category.” PHOTOS: Oscars 2016 Red Carpet Fashion: Most Outrageous Accessories \nNo Love for Pixar’s Animated Features \n\"No Sing or Finding Dory ! It’s shocking that a well-regarded Pixar movie did not even get a nomination. Finding Dory was the biggest box-office hit of 2016. Zooptopia will win.” The Disney film is up against Kubo and the Two Strings , Moana , My Life as a Zucchini and The Red Turtle . \nAnother Speech for Meryl Streep? \nThe Lead Actress category had quite a few surprises. \"No Amy Adams for Arrival ! Wow. I wonder if Meryl Streep took her spot after the Golden Globes speech. The role as a vain opera singer (in Florence Foster Jenkins ) was very slight compared to Adams’ heavy lifting. (AA, after all, literally saved the entire world in her performance.) Ruth Negga was easily the best part of Loving — that nomination wasn't such a surprise. I thought Taraji P. Henson ( Hidden Figures ) might slip in there, as well as Annette Bening for 20th Century Women . It’s nice to see so many strong contenders in this category.\" \nScorsese Snubbed for Best Director, Mel Gibson Is Forgiven \n\" Mel Gibson for Hacksaw Ridge over Martin Scorsese for Silence ! Both are heavy, faith-based dramas. Oh, my goodness, this never would have seemed possible 10 years ago.” In 2007, Scorsese won for The Departed, and Gibson’s career took a hit after his misogynistic, anti-Semitic rant while getting pulled over for a DUI. \nBest Picture Shocker \n\" Hacksaw Ridge ! This has to be considered a big upset considering that Mel Gibson was a pariah as recent as a year ago. Hidden Figures got that nomination too. It had to help that the movie is a crowd-pleasing hit.\" \nSuperheroes Still Don’t Stand a Chance \nDeadpool, starring Ryan Reynolds — who received a Golden Globe nod — was thought to be an Oscar contender, but after \"unlikely buzz, it got shut out entirely. It will have to comfort itself in the money it made at the box office.\" \nWant stories like these delivered straight to your inbox? Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter!
