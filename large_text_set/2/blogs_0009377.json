As alcohol accumulates in your blood, your blood vessels enlarge. “This, in turn, makes the skin warm and triggers the sweat glands,” says Cidambi. \nBut here’s an important point: Sweating alcohol won’t help you clear your hangover faster. Cidambi says that your liver processes about 90 percent of the alcohol. Breaking down that booze takes time—especially if you over-imbibed. \nIn fact, trying to sweat it out may even make your hangover symptoms worse. Alcohol cues the kidneys to produce extra urine, which results in dehydration. Sweat like crazy during a set of intervals and you’ll compound that dehydration problem and may even worsen your hangover symptoms. Here’s the smarter way to cure a hangover. \nCidambi says that a single instance of drinking so much you smell like a trashed mini bar isn’t a sign of a problem. But if you’re regularly getting whiffs of whiskey during your Saturday morning workouts, you may want to rethink how much you drink—and why.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:30:51.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
