The ex-couple's divorce finalization is imminent, according to court documents obtained by ET. WATCH: Amber Heard Claims Johnny Depp Is Delaying Final Divorce Proceedings: 'I Want My Life Back' The documents show that on Friday, a judge rejected Heard's request to delay the final divorce in order to take Depp's deposition. Additionally, the $7 million the 53-year-old actor is to pay Heard, 30, who requested renegotiation, will stand. The judge also rejected Depp's request for $100,000 from Heard for delaying the proceedings, and both parties are responsible for paying their own attorney's fees, despite Heard's request that Depp pay hers. Heard's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, tells ET that the actress' divorce from Depp will be finalized once the judge enters the judgment of dissolution, which is expected to happen at some point on Friday. Heard and Depp married in February 2015. The actress filed for divorce in May 2016, when a nearly eight month-long battle between the two would ensue. Watch the video below for more.
