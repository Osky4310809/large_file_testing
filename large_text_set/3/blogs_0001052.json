Attorney General Jeff Sessions even went so far as to say that marijuana is responsible for rising opiate use despite the statistics showing otherwise. \nAs the Free Thought Project has previously reported, a JAMA Internal Medicine study looked at ten years of data in all 50 states, concluding that states with medical cannabis laws had significantly lower rates of opioid overdose mortality. \nAlso, a second study has confirmed the powerful effect that medical cannabis has on reducing opioid abuse. \nIn 17 states with medical cannabis laws in place by 2013, the researchers “ found that the use of prescription drugs for which marijuana could serve as a clinical alternative fell significantly, once a medical marijuana law was implemented .” \nThe new policy suggestions drew widespread backlash, considering that a majority of the country is now in support of legalizing marijuana. \nFBI director James Comey even admitted during a speech recently that the drug war is a failure, but conceded that he still plans on pointlessly throwing people in jail anyway. During a talk at the Glen Allen High School in Virginia, Comey said, “We cannot arrest our way out of this problem. We will do our part and we will try to lock up as many drug dealers as we can and alert people to the dangers, but the problem is not going to be solved unless it is done is a holistic way.” \n“The answer is what is represented in this room, which is attacking that problem from all different dimensions. It’s done by bringing in the faith community, the education community, the medical community. I have come back many times in my mind over the last 16 years seeking centering, seeking escape, seeking a reminder of what a healthy public community is like. I’ve especially made those trips in my mind over the past 12 months,” he added.

However, very few people in Washington seem to have the courage or initiative to actually make a stand and put the breaks on this terrible drug policy.

From the Prison Industrial Complex to vice cops who want to keep their jobs, there are some seriously wealthy/powerful people with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. It isn’t a matter of failure or success – it’s a matter of extortion, power, and profit… all of which is fueled by cheap fear mongering. “Legalize drugs and your children will be sucking (black) dick for their next hit.” Mark Skinner \nCat, I really enjoy your input into various subjects. And here, once again, you are right on the money. OneGoodDeed \nAs the CIA controls the poppy fields in Afghanistan while Border Patrol regulates the supply to the United States. Got it Comey or is that Commie? Americans are stupid… Mark Skinner \nInstead of declaring war on the poppy fields of Afghanistan, why not allow them to grow their poppies then we buy them from the farmers to use in the legal manufacture in the western world. Result: We have a supply of hospital grade morphine purchased from happy farmers who are paid decently and who don’t have to worry about the DEA burning their crops, and because it is all purchased legally, there is none left over for street (illegal) use by junkies in America and the rest of the World.
