Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush will attend president-elect Donald Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, according to a statement from the former president . \n\"They are pleased to be able to witness the peaceful transfer of power -- a hallmark of American democracy -- and swearing-in of President Trump and Vice President Pence,\" Bush's spokesman Freddy Ford said in a written statement. \nNo other information was released. \nBush will not be the only former president in attendance. According to Politico , former President Jimmy Carter also announced he will attend. \nBut a spokesman for Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, told Politico the 92-year old 41st president will not be attending the inauguration, citing his age as the reason why he was skipping the event. \nThe relationship between Bush and Trump has been complicated. Both George W. and Laura Bush did not vote for either Trump or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, instead voting for Republicans down ballot. The former president and his father sat out the 2016 general election. \nBut after Trump's surprising victory, Bush released a statement saying he had called Trump and congratulated him on his election. \nBill and Hillary Clinton attended Trump's third wedding in 2005, but the former president and Trump's rival in 2016 haven't said whether they'll attend the inauguration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T20:39:33.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
