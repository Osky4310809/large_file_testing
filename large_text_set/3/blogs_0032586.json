By Dan Gigler / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nTender Bar + Kitchen in Lawrenceville will close on April 22. \nThe upscale cocktail lounge opened in 2013 in the former Arsenal Bank building that dates to the 1890s but for many years was a vacant albatross on the Butler Street corridor. \nSpeaking on the phone from a business trip in London, owner Jeff Catalina joked that he is trading one kind of bottle service for another, a reference to his three-month-old daughter. He also cited an increasingly competitive eating and drinking scene in the city. \n“What a great cocktail scene we have here. The bar has been raised and the talent we have in this city is incredible,” he said. \n“We’re proud of that. I think we’ve had a tremendous amount of success — I’m biased but we are the best cocktail bar in Pittsburgh. I’m proud of our concept and of the talent brought in be part of the Tender family. We’ll hang our hats on that.” \nMr. Catalina and building owner and developer Brian Mendelssohn rehabbed the building and created a stunning and sophisticated cocktail lounge, the centerpiece of which is a massive 25-by-12-foot walnut and glass backbar. Designed by neighboring Moss Architects and built by National Woodwork in Windgap, it is complete with a library ladder and it showcases 300 often rare spirits from around the world. \nThe bar top itself is fashioned from an original marble wainscoting that was removed and repurposed. Adjacent to the bar, a bundle of checks found in the attic dating from 1895-99 were added to the wall decoupage mural. Other furnishings and decor reflect the period. \nThe Post-Gazette named it among the 15 most beautiful bars in the city in 2015. \n“It’s great to have been at least a small part of the continued revitalization of Lawrenceville,” Mr. Catalina said. “It’s great to have been a part of that story and we are very interested in making sure there is another strong concept and tenant to fill that space.” \n“We want go out with a bang,” he said. “We have nearly a month for our fans to come by and enjoy the place, until we’re ready to polish last that last glass.” \nDan Gigler: dgigler@post-gazette.com; Twitter @gigs412.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:59:53.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
