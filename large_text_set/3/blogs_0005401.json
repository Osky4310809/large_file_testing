Similar rallies were held in 32 other states and Washington, D.C., to “show support for President Trump’s ‘Contract with the American Voter,’” according to the organizers’ website . \nAustin American-Statesman reporter Taylor Goldenstein live–tweeted the event, which drew about 300 people, according to police. When an invited speaker and recently naturalized Mexican–American Trump supporter—identified only as María de Jesús—took the megaphone, the #March4Trump crowd responded by loudly calling for a border wall. \nMaría de Jesús, who apparently represents a group called Latino Trump Coalition USA , appears to have quickly pacified the situation by getting everyone to sing the National Anthem. \nWatch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T02:59:46.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
