Steve Jurvetson/Flickr.com Updated January 22, 2016 . \nWhen Barack Obama became the first African American elected president on Nov. 4, 2008, the world viewed it as a boon to race relations. But after Obama took office, he was the target of racist illustrations, conspiracy theories and Islamophobia. Can you name any of the tactics used to attack him on the basis of race? This analysis covers three blatant acts of racism against Obama. The Birther Debate \nThroughout his presidency, Barack Obama has been dogged by rumors that he’s not an American by birth. Instead, the “birthers”—as the people spreading this rumor are now known—say that the president was born in Kenya. Although Obama’s mother was a white American, his father was a black Kenyan national. His parents, however, met and married in the United States, which is why the birther conspiracy has been deemed equal parts silly and racist . \nThe birthers have also refused to accept as valid the documentation provided by Obama that proves he was born in Hawaii. Why is this racist? New York Times columnist Timothy Egan explained that the birther movement “has little to do with reality and everything to do with the strangeness of Obama’s background — especially his race.\" He continued, \"Many Republicans refuse to accept that Obama could come from such an exotic stew and still be ‘American.’ …So, even though the certificate of live birth first made public in 2008 is a legal document that any court would have to recognize, they demanded more.” \nWhen Donald Trump repeated the claims of birthers in April 2011, the president responded by releasing his long form birth certificate . This move did not completely quiet the rumors about Obama’s origins. But the more documentation the president has released about his birthplace, the less ground the birthers have to suggest that the black president did not belong in office. Political Caricatures of Obama \nBefore and after his presidential election, Barack Obama has been depicted as subhuman in graphics, email transmissions and posters. While turning politicians into caricatures isn't new, the ones used to criticize Obama frequently have racial overtones. The president has been portrayed as a shoeshine man, an Islamic terrorist and a chimp, to name a few. The image of his altered face has been shown on a product called Obama Waffles in the manner of Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben. \nThe depictions of Obama as ape-like have arguably sparked the most controversy, considering that blacks have been portrayed as monkey-like for centuries to suggest that they’re inferior to other groups. Still, when Marilyn Davenport, an elected official in the Republican Party of Orange County, Calif., circulated an email portraying Obama and his parents as chimps, she initially defended the image as political satire. Mike Luckovich, Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist for the Atlanta Journal Constitution , had a different take. He pointed out to National Public Radio that the image wasn’t a cartoon but Photoshopped. \n“And it was crude and it was racist,” he said. “And cartoonists are always sensitive. We want to make people think—we even want to tick people off occasionally, but we don’t want our symbolism to overwhelm our message. …I would never show Obama or an African American as a monkey. That’s just racist. And we know the history of that.” Prev", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T05:57:19.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
