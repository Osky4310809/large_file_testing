Faced with environmental disaster and plunging birthrates, Gilead is ruled by a totalitarian leader, who, citing a return to traditional values, forces women into sexual servitude to repopulate the earth.\nThe chilling trailer begins with The Handmaid’s Tale ’s lead character, Offred, played by Elisabeth Moss, describing how regular society descended into chaos. “I was asleep before, that’s how we let it happen. When they slaughtered Congress we didn’t wake up, when they blamed terrorists and suspended the constitution we didn’t wake up then either.” We then see Offred and other women lose their jobs, their bank accounts, and their rights — and the beginning of their resistance.\nThe book’s adaptation has resonated with activists in America. Just this week pro-choice activists in Texas donned the shows recognisable cloaks and bonnets in protest against the attempted rollback of abortion access in the state.\nWatch the full trailer above and the previous teasers below. Look out for the series, which also stars Samira Wiley and Alexis Bledel, premiering April 26 on Hulu.\n\n\nIn lighter news, celebrate national puppy day with streetwear for your pup. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:02:40.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
