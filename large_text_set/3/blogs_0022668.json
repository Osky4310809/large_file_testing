Hollins made things official with a post on Twitter: A boogie @_AlfredHollins I would like to thank everyone for supporting me throughout this process and finally deciding to attend Oregon St next year #GoBeavs https://t.co/UZJl6IWlcO 3/21/2017, 11:51:00 PM According to Scout.com , Hollins is the 28th-ranked player overall and 11th-ranked small forward among all class of 2017 recruits. Furthermore, Hollins clocks in as the top-ranked player at his position in the state of Arizona. Prior to Tuesday's announcement, Hollins had reportedly narrowed down his list of prospective schools to Oregon State, Florida State, Oregon and Virginia Tech. However, the Beavers ultimately won out over more established ACC and Pac-12 powers after Hollins came away impressed by the way the program presented itself during his visit. \"The coaching staff and players were really open and showed me around,\" Hollins said, per the Oregonian 's Andrew Nemec . \"It was very honest. They didn't sugarcoat anything and kept it upfront. I liked that. Honesty really helps you as a player. You don't want to go somewhere where the coaches tell you you're doing good when you're really not.\" Hollins was also encouraged with the way the student body at Oregon State embraced a team that finished 5-27 overall and dead last in the conference. \"Even though they had a bad season, they still had almost 10,000 fans (against Oregon),\" he said, per Nemec. \"Everybody is getting back healthy and that's good to see. They are excited and are still hungry and not giving up. No one pointed the finger. They take pride in what they do and just want to be a better team.\" With Hollins officially in the fold, the Beavers now have a core in place that could vault them up the Pac-12 standings as soon as the 2017-18 season. Not only does the Hillcrest Prep product project as a prominent piece of the Beavers' rotation, but head coach Wayne Tinkle will have 4-star shooting guard Ethan Thompson and 3-star swingman Zach Reichle at his disposal as well. Factor in the return of Tres Tinkle —who broke his wrist in November and missed all but six games —and the Beavers could make a big leap as they attempt to make their second NCAA tournament appearance in three years.
