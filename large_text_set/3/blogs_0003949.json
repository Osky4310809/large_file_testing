(GeekWire Photo / Alan Boyle) WASHINGTON, D.C. —Jeff Bezos announced satellite provider Eutelsat as the first customer for his Blue Origin space venture’s New Glenn orbital rocket, and showed off a new animation depicting the rocket taking off, delivering a payload to orbit and landing on a barge at sea.\n\nRodolphe Belmer, Eutelsat CEO, said he expects the first satellite launch to take place in 2021. \nThe billionaire Amazon founder made the announcement at the Satellite 2017 conference here this morning, delivering a broad outline of Blue Origin’s ambitions in commercial space. The vision, he reiterated, is to have “millions of people living and working in space.”\nAlso in his remarks, Bezos stressed the importance of “true operational reusability” in spacecraft, saying the company will not only recover rockets through vertical landings but aim to use them again with minimal work. “We need to get to a place ultimately that is much more like commercial airliners,” he said.\nHis comments came a week after he acknowledged floating a proposal to NASA suggesting that Blue Origin could make payload deliveries to the lunar surface, starting as early as 2020. The aim would be to build a permanent base for humans in the moon’s south polar region.\nSuch a base on the rim of Shackleton Crater could theoretically take advantage of water ice deposits for manufacturing fuel and oxygen, and nearly constant sunlight for energy. \nThe plan is a previously undisclosed step in Bezos’ long-held vision of having millions of people living and working in space. \nIt was to pursue that vision that Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, only a few years after founding Amazon in Seattle. Today more than 900 employees work at the company’s headquarters in Kent, Wash., and at its test range on ranchland owned by Bezos in West Texas. Blue Origin is also building a 750,000-square-foot rocket factory and leasing a launch complex in Florida. \nFor now, the top projects on Blue Origin’s agenda are the New Shepard suborbital spaceship and the advanced BE-4 rocket engine . \nOne New Shepard craft has made five successful uncrewed test flights to space and back from the West Texas launch site. If the development process continues according to plan, an upgraded New Shepard could start carrying test astronauts late this year, and start flying paying passengers next year. \nMeanwhile, Blue Origin’s BE-4 engines are expected to go through full-scale testing soon and could start putting payloads in orbit within the next couple of years. The BE-4 is slated to be used on United Launch Alliance’s next-generation Vulcan rocket as well as Blue Origin’s own New Glenn rocket, whose name pays tribute to the late space pioneer John Glenn. \nBezos has also talked about an even more powerful rocket, the New Armstrong, which is named after moonwalker Neil Armstrong. That rocket, which hasn’t yet gotten off the drawing boards, would take on deep-space missions. However, Bezos said last week that a beefed-up version of the New Glenn would have enough oomph to get payloads to the moon.\nBezos is funding Blue Origin from his personal fortune, not Amazon revenue. Last year he acknowledged that he’s put well more than half a billion dollars into the company. His current net worth is estimated at $73 billion, or nearly four times NASA’s annual budget. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:02:48.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
