Ross confirmed that one employee, hired in 2009, wasn’t able to provide proper US documentation and that he was fired within the past month or so.\nThe issue came up at the start of Ross’ hearing, when committee chairman Sen. John Thune asked Ross to clarify what had happened. Thune said Ross had informed the committee of the issue during the vetting process.\n“Upon your nomination and as part of this nomination process, my understanding is that you determined that you had hired a household employee in 2009 who presented a Social Security card in the employee’s name along with a valid driver’s license,” Thune said. “But he recently was unable to provide similar documentation again.”\n“Those are the facts and we did the best that we thought we could do,” Ross said.\nThune thanked Ross “for being forthcoming about this particular matter,” as did ranking Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:48:14.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
