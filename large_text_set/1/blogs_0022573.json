He was caught in an FBI sting operation after attempting to purchase grenades and bomb-making materials from an undercover informant. \nHe was recorded telling the informant, “I’m gonna do the backpack, that’s for sure, I’m gonna do the backpack”— a reference to the bomb he intended to create. The bomb would have been packed with nails to inflict maximum carnage. He had already purchased the nails at the time of his arrest. \nProsecutors say his objective was to rig bombs under police cars or kill police officers with a car bomb attack. He also talked about staging attacks on beaches in Key West, Marathon, or Miami during the Fourth of July holiday. \nAnother undercover video has Suarez declaring that “Muslim brothers” should buy “AKs, knives, and machetes” and prepare to fight. \nHe said the same thing in one of his Facebook posts: “Stand up with us my brother. Stand up with the black flag and the AK with 10 mag, fight with us, be a gangster with us, kill our enemies and convert to Islam now in USA.” \nSuarez has proven to be quite a headache for his legal defense team, which has twice asked for permission to withdraw from his case. He once wrote to the judge and asked for all the charges against him to be dropped because his record showed that he was a “responsible gun owner.” (In fact, he legally purchased an AK-47 rifle before his arrest, but he never picked it up, because he did not fill out the paperwork correctly. That is one of the details the magistrate instructed the jury not to consider.) \nNot surprisingly, his counsel has attempted the insanity defense. As the Broward-Palm Beach New Times reported in November 2015, they were able to marshal some evidence to support the claim: his friends and family have said he believes in vampires, zombies, Bigfoot, mermaids, and the Smurfs. He has repeatedly been described as having the mind of an 11- or 12-year-old. His defenders accuse the FBI of taking advantage of a man with serious mental problems. \n“What I’ve observed is a young man who is very immature for his age, has a very low intellect, and I think that that plays into what happened to him,” defense attorney Richard Della Fera said after a court appearance in August 2015. \nAt Suarez’s trial Monday, Della Fera declared, “There’s no action, it’s just talk. Harlem Suarez is not even a practicing Muslim and knows very little, if anything, about the Islamic religion.” \nThe Miami Herald reports Della Fera “stood up to say his client was goaded, intimidated, and directed into trying to buy explosives from a paid FBI informant.” \nSeveral undercover informants testified on the first day of the trial, including one who quoted Suarez saying, “Everyone against us must die. We are ISIS Muslims. One day I will cook Americans.” \nCBS News reports the trial is expected to last about two weeks, and Suarez could face life in prison if convicted.
