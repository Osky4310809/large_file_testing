Of course you don’t, and that’s because it’s been a very long time since anything was good. I was pretty sure that portion of my brain that feels joy or pleasure or even mild contentment was removed by psychic surgeons in the dead of night sometime back in November.\nAdvertisement \n\nI’m confused, then, because today almost feels like it might be... pretty good ?\n\nLet’s look at two and a half pieces of evidence:\nFirst: Republican leaders withdrew their terrible replacement healthcare bill after Donald Trump first pressured them to vote on it, then decided he didn’t want them to vote on it. (In between, Paul Ryan rushed to the White House to tell him they didn’t have the votes to pass the thing.)\nAdvertisement \n\nThe vote is dead, the ACA will stand indefinitely and provide people with lifesaving coverage, and the president is probably very embarrassed. Failing to secure a vote on this terrible bill is a rebuke to his entire agenda and a stunning indicator of his incompetence and failure to secure consensus even among his own party. \n\nThat seems... quite good?\nSecond: Media Matters reports that Alex Jones has apologized for fanning the flames of Pizzagate , the conspiracy theory that alleged that a ring of DC elites are sex-trafficking children from the basement of a pizza parlor. Jones specifically apologized to Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis, the restauranteur he previously implied was probably keeping children in the basement.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:06:31.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
