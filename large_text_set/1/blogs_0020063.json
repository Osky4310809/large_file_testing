I can only say that I am with you 1,000 percent. And the reason that you’re my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media. They are among the most dishonest human beings on Rarth. [Chuckles and applause] And they sort of made it sound like I have a feud with the intelligence community . And I just wanted to let you know, the reason you’re the No. 1 stop, it is exactly the opposite. Exactly, and they understand that too. \nBolding inserted to highlight a true point: The media made it sound like Trump had a feud with the intelligence community — precisely because Donald Trump started a feud with the intelligence community. After intelligence officials concluded that Russia had attempted to swing the presidential election in his favor, Trump’s transition team in December put out this statement : “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s now time to move on and ‘Make America Great Again.’ ” \nAs the transition wore on, Trump suspected intelligence officials of leaking stuff to the media, and he tweeted his concerns to the whole world: Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 . @FoxNews \"Outgoing CIA Chief, John Brennan, blasts Pres-Elect Trump on Russia threat. Does not fully understand.\" Oh really, couldn't do… \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2017 about that…Those Intelligence chiefs made a mistake here, & when people make mistakes, they should APOLOGIZE.\" Media should also apologize \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017 The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia…… \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nSo there are a couple of possibilities here. One is that Trump genuinely feels that he can trick a roomful of spies into believing that his hard feelings about the intelligence community really were a concoction of a corrupt media. Another is that media-blaming is actually Trump’s way of saying, “I’m sorry for my childish behavior.” Choose your weapon. opinions", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T01:28:20.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
