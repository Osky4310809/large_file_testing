\nREPORT: Roar torn apart in South Korea \nWhile there is no simple, standalone answer, one thing is clear: The current A-League system - aimed at creating a competitive domestic league - is hurting Australian success in Asia, a contradiction that is difficult to correct. \nOne of those major factors involves the schedule of games A-League teams are forced to endure when competing on two fronts. Plus the salary cap system which levels the competition in the A-League, but hurts teams playing in Asia. \nHere are the main reasons for our struggles in the Champions League \nIMPOSSIBLE TRAVEL SCHEDULE \nBoth Brisbane Roar and Western Sydney Wanderers played on Saturday night in the A-League. Then, with just two days rest - which included hours of travel within them - they played again on Tuesday night. \nThat alone put them at a significant disadvantage to their opponents. \nHow? \nTHE FALLOUT: ‘The darkest day in Australian club football’ \nA 2012 study analysed how different times between matches impacted results. Looking at 27,002 games from European domestic competitions and the UEFA Champions League and Europa League, the findings were stark – playing with only two days rest drastically impacts the likelihood of doing well. \nA team with only two days recovery was 39 percent less likely to win at home and 42 percent less likely to win away from home when they faced a team with three or more days recovery. \nAlso, with only two days rest, a team would score 70 percent less and conceded 75 percent more goals in the final 30 minutes of matches. 'This is the darkest day' 12:07 \nBrisbane and Wanderers had two days off between games, while their opponents, Ulsan Hyundai and Shanghai SIPG, had six. \nThen, take into account the travel requirements of A-League teams playing in Asia – where the best away trips could lead to 10+ hour direct flights. \nOne A-League club last season had to endure a 30 hour trip from Australia to their destination – a trip which included staying overnight at an airport hotel and multiple coach trips in addition to two flights. \nFor years, A-League clubs have been crying out for FFA to make concessions for clubs competing in Asia, but to do that, the governing body would have to put at jeopardy the domestic competition. \nWhereas in England, league schedules are released six weeks at a time, allowing for changes based on televised games and cup commitments, the A-League does not have that luxury. \nInstead, the season’s draw is released in full in advance of the first game — locking in venues and allowing teams and fans to prepare for the greater travel required. \nWe’ve seen with the difficulties in booking out a venue for the 2014-15 Grand Final, imagine that on a monthly basis in the A-League, with no club owning their own stadium. \nWHY IS IT DIFFERENT TO OTHER COUNTRIES? \nBut how is this different to Chinese, South Korean and Japanese teams coming to Australia in the Champions League, especially considering Japanese giants Urawa Red Diamonds had to travel to Campbelltown last week, where they emphatically beat the Wanderers 4-0? \nUrawa were in the same boat as Australian clubs for that game – playing a Japanese Super Cup game on Saturday before playing in the ACL again on Tuesday. \nYet for the most part, A-League teams compete against Asian giants whose season doesn’t commence until the weekend – meaning their sole focus is to win early group stage matches. \nThey also have to travel to Australia only once, then enduring easier away trips, while Australian teams have to take long away trips three times in the group stage. SIPG dismantle Wanderers 1:51 \nSALARY CAP PUNISHES SUCCESS \nAdelaide, Western Sydney and Brisbane were the country’s best three teams in the A-League last season. \nNow, competing in Asia almost a year on from their best form, Adelaide have lost Craig Goodwin, Stefan Mauk, Bruce Kamau, Bruce Djite and Pablo Sanchez, all crucial to their championship success. \nWestern Sydney have lost foreign contingent Alberto, Andreu, Romeo Castelen as well as Mark Bridge and Dario Vidosic. \nBrisbane Roar lost Henrique, James Donachie, Steven Lustica and Corona. \nThe reason for losing so much key talent, according to Fox Sports football expert Mark Bosnich, is simple – the salary cap. \n“It’s ridiculous,” said Bosnich, who declared the salary cap “archaic”. \n“Forget other sports (and what other Australian clubs do) ... they have not got an international market. We are playing against the rest of the world and you’re continually punishing people for success.” Roar embarrassed in Ulsan 0:54 \nThe purpose of the salary cap is to provide competitive balance to the A-League. Based on that premise, the salary cap does its job. \nComparing the first 10 seasons of the A-League to four European leagues (Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga and Ligue 1) and the J1 League, the A-League had: \n— Almost no correlation from one season’s performance to the next. The percentage chance of repeating your position from year to year in the A-League is 5%. That means success or failure in one season means next to nothing once you begin the next campaign - great for fans who want to have hope for their team that year. \n— Half of the competition (five teams) has finished in the top two in the last three seasons and no team has had back-to-back top two finishes \nSo in achieving competitive balance, the salary cap does act as a leveller in the A-League. \nIt doesn’t, however, help teams trying to compete in the ACL the following season – having undoubtedly lost some key players. \nFormer Western Sydney Wanderers assistant coach Ante Milicic believes some of these factors play a major part in how A-League teams go in Asia, with no club likely to replicate the Wanderers’ 2014 triumph unless changes occur. \n“Western Sydney Wanderers have shown you can match it in Asia but, gee, it was difficult,” Milicic told Leopold Method . “And until we make things easier for clubs, and I don’t know if this is for FFA or AFC to solve, with the way our seasons are aligned, with the travelling, the size of the squads, the budget – it’s going to be difficult for a club to sustain that level of competitiveness. And I think that level of competitiveness is important because we’ve seen, with the Wanderers’ success, the exposure and the respect Australian football has got as a result, it makes it worthwhile to invest more into the Champions League. \n“It’s going to be very difficult to see something like this happening again. That’s not to say it can’t be done, but under those circumstances, what an achievement. A lot of things have to fall into place if we are to remain competitive and we need to make adjustments because the value of doing well in Asia is now there for everyone to see.” \nCLUBS FORCED TO PRIORITISE \nThis difficulty with travel and recovery between A-League and ACL matches inevitably means teams are forced to prioritise. \nIn an interview with foxsports.com.au in December , Graham Arnold admitted Sydney FC focused too much on the ACL last season, to the detriment of their entire A-League season. \n“Last year we tried to improve things: we were in two competitions, one we were successful in (ACL), one we weren’t,” he said. \n“We made the last 16 of Asia, maybe my focus was too much on that. Even on the recruitment side of things – I recruited players who could deal with both types of situations.” \nContrast that with teams competing in the ACL this season and you see both Brisbane and Western Sydney fielded severely weakened teams, in an attempt to avoid injury to key players which would impact their run to the Top 6 domestically. \nThe Fox Football Podcast gang are back as Adam Peacock, Simon Hill and Daniel Garb run the rule over the game’s big issues. \nARE WE GETTING WORSE? \nFour of the top 10 worst ACL results for an Australian team have come in the last eight days. \nThat doesn’t make for pretty reading, no matter which way you look at things. \nBut these kind of results have happened before, just not this many so close together. \nIn the 2009 Group Stage, Central Coast Mariners lost 5-0 at home to Kawasaki Frontale. Almost two months later, Newcastle Jets copped six away to Pohang Steelers. \nAnd in 2012, the Mariners were on the receiving end of 5-0 and 3-0 losses to Seongnam and Nagoya Grampus in the group stage. In the same year, the all-conquering Brisbane Roar side under Ange Postecoglou were winless in the group stage, picking up three draws and three losses. \nSo while we have witnessed the miraculous anomaly of Western Sydney winning the ACL in 2014 and Adelaide United reaching the final before the competition’s reformatting, these prove to be the exception to the rule.
