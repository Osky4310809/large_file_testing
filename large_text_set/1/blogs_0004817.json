Both players have signed a Kolpak deal with English county side, Hampshire. While Abbott's contract with CSA has already been terminated, the board is in the process of doing the same with Rossouw. \n\"I don't agree with it but I respect it,\" South Africa captain Faf du Plessis after the second Test against Sri Lanka in Cape Town. Abbott, who was one of the most promising fast bowlers for South Africa in recent times. He has called it quits after playing just 11 Tests for South Africa, picking 39 wickets at an average of 21.31. He also played 28 ODIs and 21 T20Is for South Africa. \n\"Making the decision to commit my long term future to Hampshire was undoubtedly the most difficult one I have ever had to make and I leave with more than a little sadness knowing that I won't represent the Proteas again. Representing my country was undoubtedly the biggest honour in my career and I am very thankful for the opportunity to have represented South Africa and the Proteas,\" said Abbott in a statement released by Cricket South Africa. \n\"I can confirm that I have agreed and signed a 3 year deal with Hampshire Cricket. Deciding to leave South Africa is something I have thought long and hard about and moving to England will give me and my family the long term career security that I believe is important at this stage of my life. I have loved representing the Proteas and will watch from afar with great affection every time they take the field from now on but I am hugely dedicated to making Hampshire cricket successful on the field,\" said Rossouw in a similar statement. \nThe development came as a shock for CSA, who will now be bracing themselves for more such similar exits . \nMore to follow...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T13:51:18.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
