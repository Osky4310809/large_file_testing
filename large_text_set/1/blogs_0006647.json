'Damn it', I said, 'today this had to happen?' \n\"I am very happy at Juventus and until they kick me out, I'm content to stay.\" \nJuve reached the final of the Champions League in Allegri's first season in charge, losing 3-1 to Barcelona in Berlin. \nThe 49-year-old confirmed that securing a sixth successive league title is the team's priority, but he remains hopeful the club can progress in Europe, where they face a last-16 tie against Porto. \n\"Our primary objective is the Scudetto and it is absolutely not easy, because Roma are pushing, so are Napoli, and we need at least 85 points to be sure of the title,\" he said. \n\"The Champions League is a very different type of tournament where one incident can make all the difference. \n\"Over a league season, these things even themselves out, whereas in Europe you've got one chance.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:49:30.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
