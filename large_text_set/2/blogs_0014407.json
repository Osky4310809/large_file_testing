Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com \nJUPITER, Fla. • With a whole year off to recover from Tommy John elbow surgery in 2011, Adam Wainwright went to Home Depot and wandered the aisles, shopping for a hobby. \nHe found a mission. \n“I was trying to figure out what am I going to do?” Wainwright said. “I started thinking I’m going to take up woodworking. I always wanted to do carpentry. I started thinking about how hard that would be with one arm. Realized that wasn’t very good. I passed the row of seeds and some planter boxes and thought, ‘Maybe I’ll get some pots.’” \nAs he rehabbed his elbow, Wainwright found a challenge and solace in gardening and, he explained, uncovered the roots of his charity work. The Cardinals’ starter intends to run a farm after he retires and use it to feed “thousands who are in need.” That doesn’t happen, that idea doesn’t find him, he said, if he doesn’t get a green thumb while healing his elbow. \nCardinals rookie Alex Reyes had reconstructive surgery on his right elbow ligament Thursday in Jupiter, Fla., and will officially miss the entire 2017 season. Dr. George Paletta rebuilt the ruptured ligament, and Reyes is expected to need 12 months to rehab. They can be a grinding, boring, numbing, repetitive 12 months, according to pitchers who have gone through the process. But, of those still in the Cardinals’ clubhouse, they can also be rewarding — if the pitcher finds other things to improve beyond his arm. \n“Pick a hobby,” lefty Marco Gonzales was told as advice. “Make goals.” \n“Take something good out of this,” said Kyle McClellan, a former Cardinals pitcher who had Tommy John in the minors. “Don’t just take a year. Learn something from it. Look for something. Find something to get better at.” \nFormer Cardinals pitcher Jaime Garcia returned from his rehab year with a sinker that now defines his career. McClellan said his year helped him mature and realize the game offers no promises. Lance Lynn, who is set to return this year from elbow surgery, said he didn’t change much but he had more time to build strength in his legs because “what else are you going to do?” \nWainwright became a gardener, and Gonzales spent the past year realizing the value of the types of food Wainwright now harvests. The lefty, who had Tommy John surgery last spring, rethought his nutrition and conditioning. \n“The blessing that I’ll have from this year is taking charge of my fitness and nutrition goals, and also just having that final rest that allowed me to recharge my arm,” Gonzales said. “Lord knows that through college, through pro ball I was used quite a bit. For me to take six months — also the longest I’ve ever gone in my life without touching a baseball — it will work wonders for my career down the road.” \nThe challenge that comes with the timing of Reyes’ surgery is the same one Gonzales faces, Wainwright faced, but Lynn won’t. Springtime surgery puts the pitcher on a program that has him throwing, building strength through next winter. \nLynn had surgery in November 2015, which allowed him a normal offseason. \n“Mine worked out perfectly so I could end my rehab when I was supposed to end it, then go into the break,” Lynn said. “That’s why you see guys wear down in that first year back. They never have a break. They rehab and then go straight into the season and now you’re throwing 18 straight months or something. They’re nonstop all year.” \nThe Cardinals intend to have rookie Reyes do his rehab in St. Louis all summer. In that atmosphere, and around the team, the idea is that he’ll continue to develop and find some interest, some strength, something to improve. \nHe can do as Wainwright and the others did: grow mentally, physically or agriculturally. \n“Any kind of tomatoes you can think of. Zucchini. Yellow squash. Apples. Pears. Blueberries. Blackberries. Watermelon. Corn. Peas. Carrots. Literally everything,” Wainwright said, detailing his current garden. “It’s something I can do until I’m old and gray. ... Gardening somewhat changed my life. It gives me a way to compete when I’m done playing baseball. Feeding people, something I always wanted to do, just fits. Like where God’s leading me.” Extra bases \n• Lynn rejoined camp Thursday after attending a family funeral. He is set to throw for the first time Friday. ... To add pitching depth for spring games, the Cardinals added righthander Corey Baker as a non-roster invite. Baker, who is getting ready to pitch for Team Israel in the World Baseball Classic, spent last year in the minors. \n• The Cardinals voided the contract of pitcher Kendry Flores. Flores, a righthander, was unable to get medical clearance to pitch this spring because of an issue within his shoulder. Flores had a 4.15 ERA as a starter in Miami’s system last year. \n• The Cardinals’ logo on batting helmets will have a raised look as the team switches from a flat sticker to a rubber, 3D “STL” that gives it an embossed look.
