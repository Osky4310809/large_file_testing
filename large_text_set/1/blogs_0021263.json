(Missed the earlier details on A4cade’s cocktail program? Find those here. ) As previously reported , A4cade is the Area Four team’s half of a collaboration with Roxy’s Grilled Cheese. Roxy’s Central will fill the front of the Central Square space ( check out the menu here ), while game lovers of all experience levels can pass through a set of swinging double doors to a bit of a secret entrance — “what appears to be an inconveniently placed walk-in fridge,” per a rep — to reach A4cade and its boozy offerings and eclectic mix of games. The space features a variety of high- and low-top tables, as well as lounge seating and ledge shelving, so there are plenty of places to snack and drink while gaming. There are also Tetris shapes on walls, providing more shelving. As for the games, the selection includes Galaga, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Deluxe, Mortal Kombat 2, Cruis’n Exotica, foosball, Skee-Ball, an Xbox console, pinball, and an 18-foot shuffleboard table. “My favorite game is Doctor Who pinball,” says Area Four co-owner Michael Krupp. “‘80s pinball with all the doctors up to Sylvester McCoy. Shoot balls at Daleks! Stare at Tom Baker’s face! What more can I say?!\" Meanwhile Roxy’s owner James DiSabatino counts shuffleboard, Skee-Ball, and NBA Jam among his favorites. Stay tuned for an opening date. Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T09:49:12.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
