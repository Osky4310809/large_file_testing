However, applying make-up while wearing your lenses is a lot tougher as even a small speck of your eye shadow could easily irritate your eyes. Plus you could end up destroying your precious lenses in just one day. Having experienced all this first hand, here is what you need to be mindful of, if you are mixing make-up and lenses. Wash your hands \nBefore you start with anything, make sure you wash your hands. You should insert your contacts before you do anything, like putting on moisturiser or make-up. Anything that's left on your fingers can transfer onto the lenses, so you want to make sure your hands are squeaky clean. Also, make sure they're hundred percent dry. Stay away from the lid ledge \nWhat is the lid ledge, you might ask? It's the part of the lid that touches the surface of your eyeballs (your waterline), and it's where the oil glands of the eyes open up. If you block those glands with make-up, it can lead to dry eyes, dirty lenses, and even sties. Basically, keep tightlining to a bare minimum. Choose your mascara wisely \nNo one likes clumpy mascaras, but you need to be extra careful. Clumps and excess particles can fall and get into the eyes, and become trapped underneath the lenses, which can lead to discomfort. Also, avoid fibre mascaras. They can cause infections. Stick with oil-free products \nAt least around your eyes. The oils found in creams and eye shadows can sometimes work their way into your eyes. We all know oil and water don't mix, and your lenses will attract oil. While it will not harm you in any way, it can make your lenses cloudy, and we don't want that. Clean your lenses properly \nGo for daily or bi-weekly disposable lenses to be safe with hygiene, but you have to care for them properly. That means that every night, clean your lenses with your lens solution, rubbing them for 15 to 20 seconds to dissolve the grime left on them from the day, and then place them in a case with fresh solution. It's also important to clean your case on a daily basis, using contact solution and make sure to clean both the bottom and the top.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T06:07:44.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
