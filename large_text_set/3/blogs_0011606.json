Brown, AFP/Getty Images) 1 CONNECT 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented workers has turned “sanctuary” into a rallying cry for both sides in the immigration debate. Facebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar: \n“Sanctuary cities” should lose all federal funding. Government leaders who promote illegal immigration should be sued by the federal government, and the city leaders who agree with these policies should be arrested. \nCharles Edward Brown \nLiberals still haven’t figured out the difference between legal and illegal immigration. They are trying to shield and protect undocumented immigrants with criminal records. What an insult to all of those who came here legally, did everything by the book to become a citizen and didn’t ask the government for assistance. I agree that federal funding should be withheld from sanctuary cities. \n— Bea Liberatore When 'sanctuary cities' go too far: Our view \nIn the past, I have worked hard, with only some minor successes, to help a refugee family come to this nation. My experience with Immigration and Naturalization Services was generally frustrating. Always looking to legal immigration, we were often thwarted for over a decade. It seemed that every change in their lives over that decade made the process start over. I would be in favor of a complete overhaul to assist and allow more legal immigration. \n— Douglas Miller \nUSA TODAY’s Editorial Board is taking the middle ground saying: What is illegal is illegal, that sanctuary cities should follow the law. However, that is not the same thing as a wholesale endorsement of President Trump’s policies. \n— George Orwell \nIt’s a crime to enter the U.S. illegally. Sanctuary cities must understand that if these individuals commit murder or other felonies, the cities have already been harboring a criminal. \n— John W. Smith \nFor more, follow @USATOpinion and #tellusatoday . 1 CONNECT 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:34:50.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
