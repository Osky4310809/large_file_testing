She’s a style maven whose look is so on-point that even her everyday outfits scream polished perfection. Of course, her red carpet looks are always a hit as well, but there’s just something so quintessentially chic about Reese’s street style that it ~must~ be emulated .\nWhich is exactly why, if your spring wardrobe budget allows, any style-minded fashionista looking to expand her investment pieces should invest in this little frock.\nOkay, so Reese didn’t exactly invent street style, but she might as well have.\nWhat she did invent, however, was Draper James . @reesewitherspoon #dress #draperjames #bag #dolcegabbana #shoes #ysl #reesewitherspoon #draperjames #summerdress #shortdress #ysl #saintlaurent #heels #dandg #dolceandgabbana #handbag #dolcegabbana #hollywood #moviestar #biglittlelies #redcarpet #redcarpetready #redcarpetfashion #fashion #fashionlove #fashiondaily #chic #springlike #colorfuldress #glamour #glamorous \nA post shared by @celebsbrands on Mar 14, 2017 at 3:28pm PDT \nIf you’re already a learned fan of Reese Witherspoon’s preppy style, then you’re probably familiar with Draper James. But just as a refresher, we’ll recap: Draper James is Reese’s ladylike store filled with sweet southern charm, “y’all” inscribed accessories, and perfect spring frocks. The Nashville-based boutique’s been around for a few years now, and its fearless founder is no doubt their best advertiser. (Reese loves stepping out in one of the brand’s charming frocks or preppy totes.)\nDoggone, the weekend is just about over But this #draperjamesblue picture @blakesandbaze took in Nashville makes it a little bit better \nA post shared by Draper James (@draperjames) on Jan 8, 2017 at 11:21am PST \nAnd while each and every one of her Draper James looks is stylish, this dress is crème de la crème.\nThis Bellamy Floral Persely Ponte Dress is designed to look good on basically every human body, with its classy crew neck and A-line shape. A pop of yellow constitutes a contrast stripe designed to zap the waistline a few inches without comprising comfort. And the ponte fabric basically translates into comfy and adorable.\nCourtesy of Draper James And if you fear florals, then this is the perfect starter dress — the blue and yellow pattern looks more like a pretty painting than a regular print.\nNow, at $195 this dress isn’t exactly a steal by non-celeb standards. But considering most celebrity looks start north of the thousands, this ain’t bad. And given the natural versatility of this dress — perfect on its own or paired with a blazer, cardigan, or denim jacket — this is a statement-making dress that will carry you from easy errands to springtime soirees.\nAgain, this is more of a splurge than a save. But if you’re looking for that right spring dress to invest in, this one’s certainly the winner.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:41:44.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
