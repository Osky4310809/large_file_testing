She was presented with a clock emblazoned with the Texas state seal, by Texas governor Greg Abbott.\nSEE ALSO: Ted Cruz issues China an epic eye roll, saying it can't tell the U.S. what to do\nTo the Chinese, giving a clock to someone is considered a huge no-no, as the words for \"give a clock\" (送鐘) sound like the ones for \"attending someone's funeral.\" (送终)\nTimepieces are also considered symbols of time running out for the other party, and a suggestion of an end of a relationship.\nSome Taiwanese and Asian-Americans are reacting in annoyance:\nFuji Chang says: \"Giving her a clock? This is so humiliating — I don't like Tsai Ing-wen, but I don't like other countries screwing her like this! Terrible Americans.\"\nPema Hsu says: \"Heavens, it's so inauspicious that the Texas governor gave Tsai a clock.\"\nBut plenty more people have shrugged it off, saying it's a dated superstition:\n我也覺得都什麼時代了還信送鐘實在是很無聊。\n— Soo Jū-hông (@speaktaiwanese) January 9, 2017\nSoo Juhong says: \"We're living in modern times — being superstitious over a clock is lame.\"\nSun Chyi-an said sarcastically: \"Tsai goes to America, meets the Texas governor who gives her a clock — this is really sending her administration to its end! Even the Americans want to sound a death knell to the Tsai administration. Hopefully they don't drag the whole of Taiwan down with it.\"\nThe cultural gaffe echoes the one committed by Susan Kramer in Taipei, who was then the British Minister of State for Transport. Last year, Kramer gave Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je a timepiece, which he responded to by calling it a \"piece of junk.\" Ko later apologised for his reaction, saying it was a joke in bad taste.\nBONUS: Ultimate food porn: Delectable dumplings from scratch (just take a seat)", "external_links": ["http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taipei-mayor-ko-wen-je-apologises-to-british-minister-over-scrap-metal-gaffe", "https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=757308831084891&id=100004173431065&match=6YCBIOmQmA%3D%3D", "https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=688748527964877&id=100004892076628&match=5pmC6ZCYLOmAgQ%3D%3D", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/78AXzrja.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/speaktaiwanese/status/818367667782369280", "http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2060637/time-not-right-texas-governors-gift-tsai", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTexansForAbbott%2Fphotos%2Fa.269781890087.322345.181888625087%2F10158071494460088%2F%3Ftype%3D3%26comment_id%3D10158073646075088&include_parent=false", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/78AXzrja.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCTfans%2Fposts%2F10154569452987479%3Fcomment_id%3D10154569723807479&include_parent=false"], "published": "2017-01-10T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T08:36:50.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
