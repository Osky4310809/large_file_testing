Chargers gift jersey to all season-ticket holders Posted by Michael Gehlken  54 PM EDT Getty Images \nThe Chargers are trying. \nNo one can accuse them of less. \nThey’ve run the Los Angeles Marathon as a relay team. They’ve eaten a team-themed chili dog at Pink’s Hot Dogs, a Hollywood staple. They’ve made a gaggle of L.A. radio and TV appearances, including “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Tight end Jeff Cumberland, who missed all of 2016 to injury, wore his Chargers jersey during a Kingdom Day Parade appearance. He also attended a Clippers-Lakers game where we was jeered and the club’s logo was booed on the big screen. \nAnd this is all since the Jan. 12 move. \nOn Tuesday, the franchise made the latest effort to endear itself to its new market, gifting all season-ticket holders a Philip Rivers powder-blue home jersey. The jerseys are available in both male and female classifications. \n“Fight for L.A.” is the former San Diego franchise’s marketing slogan. \nThis is the newest round. \n“To show our appreciation for you, we are offering exclusively to all 2017 Season Ticket Members a Philip Rivers powder blue Nike Game Jersey for each Season Ticket Member,” the official notice to customers reads , via Vincent Bonsignore of the L.A. Daily News. “Yes, a Nike Game Jersey for you to wear at all home games at StubHub Center! \n“This is our way of saying thank you from your Los Angeles Chargers.” \nFor some, this may do little to soften the astronomical season-ticket prices. \nBut it’s a gesture, and however desperate at times it may seem, the L.A. Chargers haven’t lacked for those. Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:30:14.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
