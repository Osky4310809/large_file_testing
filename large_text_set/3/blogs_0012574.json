Fifty-eight percent of the 1,500 people surveyed for the poll have an unfavorable view of the president’s job so far. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\nThe numbers mark a sharp dip from the previous weekend, when President Trump’s approval rating sat at 45%, with just under 50% disapproving. At the same point in President Obama’s first term, his approval rating was around 62%, an AOL analysis finds.\nFox News also found President Trump’s approval rating to be about 43% in a March 19 poll. In that survey, 51% of surveyed registered voters now say they do not approve of the president’s performance. A recent Rasmussen poll shows slightly better numbers for Trump: In that survey, 48% of likely voters like how things are going while 52% disapprove.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T14:05:51.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
