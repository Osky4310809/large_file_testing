Actually, yes, that’s definitely number one. But a 6-foot tapeworm isn’t too far behind. In 2014, doctors pulled one of those suckers out of a 48-year-old Indian man, and wrote about their horrific discovery —complete with pictures and video!—in the latest issue of the New England Journal Of Medicine . (That’s the tapeworm above.) \nThe man had been complaining of some pretty bad abdominal pain that lingered for 2 months, so docs performed a colonoscopy to discover the source. That’s about the time they found “an undulating, moving piece of the worm ,” Dr. Cyriac Phillips told CNN , and uncovered the rest of the creature during a follow-up endoscopy, a procedure that doctors use to look at your intestines. So they sedated the man and extracted the worm by pulling it out through his mouth with a pair of forceps, because what else are you going to use to dig up a 6-foot tapeworm? Your bare hands? “We pulled at it softly and steadily, and ultimately the job was done after maybe around 1 hour and 15 minutes,” Phillips said. “I have never seen a tapeworm this long before this particular case.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T04:49:01.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
