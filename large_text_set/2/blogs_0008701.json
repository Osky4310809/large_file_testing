But who could've guessed that meant introducing a new series full of buxom ladies? Announced at Japan Expo 2017, Bombergirl is an arcade release with four-on-four co-operative gameplay where teams try to destroy each other's bases. \nKonami's description of the title is especially hilarious. Emphasis is my own: \nAs  Bombergirl , not  Bomberman , this is an enjoyable new title with new game elements that is not only fun to play, it is also fun to watch. \nBased on the block-destroying gameplay of  Bomberman ,  Bombergirl  tasks players with destroying the opposing team’s base before the other team in four-versus-four cooperative battles. By adding new game properties such as this, it is not only fun to play, it is also fun to watch . And with the button that pops out at the end, a match of  Bombergirl  is a sight worth seeing. \nBy raising strong and cute Bombergirls, you can make use of not only bombs, but various other skills. You can proceed through the match with the upper hand by strategically using skills.  Bombergirl  will have exciting matches that you can’t take your eyes off until the very end. \nWe get it, this game has cute anime girls. It'll be playable during the Expo in Japan this weekend, but there's currently no word of a release date. I hope it releases in the West in some form. Cute Bomberman is my aesthetic. \nKonami announces Bombergirl for arcade [Gematsu]\n\nRead more...
