Barely a few hours old, his name divided net citizens into two - the ones who loved his name and the ones who felt it resembled a highly violent ruler. The pressure only seems to be building, from here on . \nIn a recent interview with Filmfare , Saif Ali Khan spoke about how he didn't care how his son looks as long as he is a good person. \n\"There is so much pressure on kids these days to be good-looking. I just hope he is a good guy. He is not the only star kid in town, there are so many. But sometimes people make it difficult and some sections of the press pay too much attention. So, it's hard to be normal but I guess that goes with the territory.\" \nWe agree with you there Saif. But we also have to agree with Kareena Kapoor Khan who has gone on record to say that her baby boy is simply gorgeous. He is, just look at these pictures", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T08:55:19.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
