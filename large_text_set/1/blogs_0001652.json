He's putting the focus on domestic travel, after past years spent traveling to other parts of the world and after a difficult year for the United States.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook's Safety Check feature was the latest victim of fake news\n\"Going into this challenge, it seems we are at a turning point in history. For decades, technology and globalization have made us more productive and connected. This has created many benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more challenging. This has contributed to a greater sense of division than I have felt in my lifetime. We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\nZuckerberg's post didn't mention the role many believe Facebook played in that division.\nZuckerberg's yearly resolutions have become a bit of a thing. In 2016, Zuckerberg challenged himself to run 365 miles during the year. He's also built an artificial intelligence tool for his home, read 25 books in a year and devoted time to learning Mandarin.\n\"My work is about connecting the world and giving everyone a voice. I want to personally hear more of those voices this year,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"It will help me lead the work at Facebook and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative so we can make the most positive impact as the world enters an important new period.\"\nBONUS: People read their first Facebook post and it gets really awkward", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Efpav9sn.m3u8", "https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103385178272401", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Efpav9sn.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-04T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:26:45.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
