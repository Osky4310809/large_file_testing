The focus is on analogies rather than traditional definitions — for example, BitCoin is “like digital gold,” while a zero-day vulnerability is “like medics discovering a new virus.” \nOf course, these analogies risk being too simplistic, but the explanation doesn’t stop there. On Sideways Dictionary, the analogy is the starting to help readers wrap their heads around the concept, and it’s followed by a (slightly) longer explanation. \nIn addition to looking technical terms up on the Sideways Dictionary website, you can also download a Google Chrome extension, and they’ll also be used on The Post website. \nBy the way, both of the analogies mentioned above were contributed by writer Nick Asbury . You can also contribute your own, and vote for the ones that are most helpful. \n“The more we can create a shared vocabulary around technology, the better we’ll be able to understand how it’s reshaping our world,” said Jigsaw head of marketing Alfred Malmros in a statement. “The innovation emerging from the technology industry is staggering, but too often we fall back on jargon to explain new concepts. Sideways wants to change that.” Featured Image: Trevor / Flickr UNDER A CC BY-SA 2.0 LICENSE 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T15:37:28.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
