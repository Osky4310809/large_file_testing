The lawmen and the outlaws were sometimes indistinguishable from each other, and those who made their names in the late 1800s are today legends that still invite awe and curiosity today. They just don’t make them like this anymore. Here are eight historical badasses of the Wild West. 1. Bass Reeves \n(source) \nOne of the possible inspirations for The Lone Ranger, Bass Reeves was born into slavery. During the Civil War, he beat up his owner and fled to Indian Territory, where he lived with the Cherokee, Seminole, and Creek until the end of the war. His knowledge of the Indian Territory and several Indian languages made him an asset, and he was recruited as the first Black Deputy U.S. Marshal west of the Mississippi. Reeves was a deputy for 32 years and brought many of the most fearsome criminals of the time to justice. He arrested over 3,000 felons, including, once, his own son. 2. Stagecoach Mary \n(source) \nDelivering mail in the Wild West was an important, yet extremely, difficult job. Stagecoach Mary – real name Mary Fields – was the first Black woman to work for the U.S. Postal Service. She won the job at age 60 because she was the fastest applicant to hitch a team of six horses. She drove a horse and wagon through outlaw territory, and was known to travel with a rifle in her lap and a bottle of whiskey at her feet. Western star Gary Cooper wrote of her, \"Born a slave somewhere in Tennessee, Mary lived to become one of the freest souls ever to draw a breath, or a .38.\" 3. Annie Oakley \n(source) \nAnnie Oakley – born Phoebe Ann Mosey – was an impoverished orphan when she beat a renowned marksman in a shooting match when she was only 15. That marksman became her husband and the two of them joined Buffalo Bill’s Wild West traveling show. Her incredible skills with a rifle made her the first female superstar in America. She tried to enlist in the military for the Spanish-American war, but wasn’t allowed to join because of her gender. She was partially paralyzed in a train accident in 1901 but managed to recover and become a better shot than ever. She taught 15,000 women to shoot guns and famously said, \"I would like to see every woman know how to handle guns as naturally as they know how to handle babies.\" From her childhood to when she died in her ‘60s, her skills with a gun blew audiences away. Encyclopedia Britannica said of her, \"At 30 paces she could split a playing card held edge-on, she hit dimes tossed into the air, she shot cigarettes from her husband's lips, and, a playing card being thrown into the air, she riddled it before it touched the ground.\" 4. Davy Crockett \n(source) \nDavy Crockett – known as the \"king of the wild frontier\", was a larger-than-life folk hero and politician eventually felled at the Battle of the Alamo. He was a political foe of the racist President Andrew Jackson, and voted against Jackson’s Indian Resettlement Act – a stance so unpopular at the time that he was voted out of office. He died fighting in the Alamo at the age of 49. Can you imagine a Congressman today going to battle himself? Paul Ryan suiting up and riding out to battle? LOL, me neither. 5. Geronimo \n(source) \nGeronimo was a leader of the Apache tribe who fought the US and Mexican armies for 30 years. Geronimo was largely seen as a pretty unlikable dude who was so skilled in battle he was thought to have supernatural powers. Leading only a small band of 16 Bedonkohe Apache warriors, Geronimo defeated hundreds of Mexican soldiers. He was known for his daring escapes, and at the end of his career he and his group evaded thousands of American and Mexican troops for over a year. He was known as the \"worst Indian who ever lived\" to the white settlers because he was one of the last leaders to completely refuse the U.S. occupation of the West. Geronimo was the most famous Native American of his time and lived the last years of his life as a prisoner of war until he died after falling off a horse at almost 80. 6. Wild Bill Hickok \n(source) \nWild Bill was one of those people who could only exist in the Wild West — he was alternately an outlaw, a lawman, and a showman. Hickok joined a vigilante group in Kansas at 18 and started calling himself \"Wild Bill\", because he could, and that’s what badasses do. He survived being mauled by a bear in an incident that was 100 percent his own fault, and then reportedly worked as a Union spy in Confederate territory during the Civil War. After the war, Hickok killed a man in a duel and got off the murder charge because the jury declared it a fair fight. After escaping the murder charge, Hickok became a deputy U.S. Marshal in Kansas. He basically spent the rest of his life killing people in duels, gambling, and drinking, until he was shot while playing poker in Deadwood. 7. Jesse James \n(source) \nJesse James is possibly the most famous American outlaw. He and his brother Frank James fought for the Confederate Army, and after the war turned to a life of crime. They robbed trains, stagecoaches, and banks. They received a \"Robin Hood\" type reputation, although there’s no evidence they actually gave their money to anyone in need. People just love badasses who break the rules, even when those badasses are pretty evil, like Jesse James was. James was murdered by the coward Robert Ford, who was then hated for the rest of his days. 8. Calamity Jane \n(source) \nCalamity Jane — real name Martha Jane Canary — was certainly not what women of the Wild West were supposed to be. She was a scout, a gunslinger, and a storyteller in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show who wore men’s clothes all throughout her life. She claimed she was part of several military conflicts with Native American tribes, although she may have been lying. Calamity Jane was infatuated with Wild Bill Hickok, who did not like her back. After she died, she was buried next to him, because someone thought that would be a hilarious prank to pull on Wild Bill. She was an illiterate alcoholic who managed to become one of the most famous women in the Wild West. It’s impossible to know how much of her life was fiction and how much of it was fact, but she was a legend even when she was alive. \nWho are your favorite historical badasses?
