At the colloquium were notable Yoruba politicians from all the political parties, including representatives of the South-West governors and former interim chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Bisi Akande. \nAsked if the politics of the geopolitical zone was part of their discussions, Ladapo said it would be improper to divulge all that they discussed at the meeting to the public. \nHe, however, said the meeting looked into various measures to be taken in order to reposition the failing economy of the South-West through an economic summit. \nLadapo said, “We looked at various studies that have been done on the economy of the geopolitical zone and we came up with some measures. The studies show that the South-West is the poorest zone in the country. This is because by 2009, most banks and industries in Nigeria were in the hands of South-West people but because of one policy or the other, today, we virtually have nothing again. You cannot build your economy if you are not an entrepreneur because you will lack the capital to develop a good idea. \n“In the production line and agriculture, the zone is behind. We rely too much on food from the northern part of the country even though we have arable land in the South-West. We have youth population that derives meagre income from riding commercial motorcycles even though some of them are graduates. \n“We have formed a committee which has Obanikoro, Bankole, Adejumo, Adetokunbo and Dr. Bayo Orire as members. I will coordinate the committee. Another meeting will be called soon. We are reaching out to captains of industries in Nigeria and abroad, present and past governors and politicians in order to move the South-West forward.” \nLadapo said more consultations would be made after a stakeholders’ meeting to discuss other issues bothering the region. \n“Bankole and Obanikoro have offered good advice on how we can move the zone forward from their own perspectives. We are happy for their presence and acceptance to work with us and look forward to bring more resourceful Yoruba sons and daughters to work with us at YPM,” he added. \nCopyright PUNCH.

himself in the position of president due to the death death of the elected president A position he never prepared for,a position he,in his widest dream,never imagined Jonathan though appears a gentle man,a good family man,a nice guy to hand out with Yet he does not look like someone with the assertiveness to handle those band of repeatedly recycled political manipulators that surround him,seems he has inadvertently allowed these self serving breed to hijack his government These political crooks,unfortunately,are much more clever and experienced than him,he is dealing with them like gentlemen but he doesn’t seem to realise what he is really up against Sometimes I pity him,most times I blame him since he has executive power to run his government ashore even though those desperadoes around him are doing everything possible to steer his ship adrift fatai \n@sunday well let me say i agree with you on your comment but just imagine if you are in his position right now,wat will you do?now take a look at wat happened yesterday on the sack and appointment of the new service chiefs,some concerned Nigerians are criticising his actions and whereas maybe he is trying to curb corruption or their incompetence nobody knows…so let me just say he can do some many things like we all suggested but he can also be hindered by some challenges we may not know about,all we are saying is that we need change for better in this country sunday322 \nDear Fatai,let me go straight to the point,you asked me if I was in Jonathan’s position what will i do I will embark on an unprecedented purge of the polity I will swiftly appoint a board of inquiry made up of well renounced social critics drawn from across the nation with their main duty being to recover as much as possible all public fund stolen by politicians both past and present,including top government and private sector officials To this end all past presidents,past and present governors and all political and top government officials shall be genuinely and aggressively probed They all shall be made to account for all the money and properties they posses at both home abroad and any one who cannot justify the source of his or her possessions wil promtly have them confiscated and be also made to face a well committed trial I will announce to the public all illgotten possessions recovered and i will form some commissions to diligently utilize the money for the provision of essential infrastructures,the effect of which must be visibly noticed by all,such as no pot holes in any Nigeria roads ,foreign companies to ensure constant power supply with a strictly specified time frame State of the art healthcare institutions with ultra modern equipments to be made available within a time line,hence everybody including the president must take treatment here in Nigeria,standard education system with all our children schooling here and a lot more developmental needs of this nation to be pragmatically addressed I must ensure that,with the enormous oil money available to this nation,we must utilise it to turn this potentially great nation around to be able compete with any advanced nation I am so sure that with real commitment and sense of purpose,this nation will become a role model for other nations to emulate isiaka \nBefore you sideline other arm of Government to take such decision unilaterally, I advice you prepare your will and buy your coffin before you imagine rulling Nigeria like a millitary junta. sunday322 \nHahahaha’isiko pele,I really understand what you mean But,you know what,if I have the chance to rule this nation,I would have been fully ready for any eventuality It’s either Nigeria moves forward at a very fast rate to compete with any advanced nation or I face whatever consequences For how long are we going to proceed at this present snail speed due to the massive looting of a very large chunk of public fund,that if channeled towards national development,would have made Nigeria as beautiful as UK and other advanced nations The money is there,only it is confined to within some few clique For any nation to make it,some people have to sacrifice Martyns Oghene (AIT – Abuja) \nNow is the time for us to put IN PLACE a strong & strict SYSTEM backed by LAW… A SYSTEM that emphasizes & empowers on the HUMAN RESOURCES… A SYSTEM that will enforce that whoever takes a post, be it political or private will have to take a oath… Oaths of if money meant for that post is being embezzled or mismanage will warrant a 24 years imprisonment & assets seized… Oaths of if at the 3rd quarter certain target percentage of what was promised base on manifestos submitted b4 assuming office was not met, that person will be relieved or removed from office… The greatest asset of a NATION is the HUMAN RESOURCES etc CHINA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, BRAZIL… Nigeria is blessed with OIL & other untapped mineral resources, but the greatest resources we have is the HUMAN RESOURCE (the people, population)… Yes, they say our politicians took oath of office, but how strong is it? What kind of oath?… The way they are acting is not reflecting on the oath they took to represent their constituencies… We need a SYSTEM now… A system that will checkmate everybody… That’s what this generation should be clamoring for… If this strong SYSTEM is being put in place, kidnapping, terrorism, corruption & other crimes will reduce drastically… Now is the time… We need a strong SYSTEM backed by a very strong LAW… Uko Sunday James \nI pray for a hard steel leader that will trample on our rights. Then we will learn to appreciate. I wonder if buhari will condone criticism ALANI \nThe problems outlined are NOT GEJ’s problems, nor are they caused by him, they are the problems caused by the political class who are both despirately greedy and seek power for selfish reason. PDP and APC are both involved neck deep with these problems and definitely neither is the solution. Shifting the power base closer to the masses by devolution of power to the states or regions, empowering the Courts of law and State Assemblies by ensuring their total independence of the executive, improving security by community and state policing will go a long way cobing the menace of corruption and insecurity. Bh sponsors must be exposed and punished by law. No one should be a sacred cow. \nGood luck is not running out of Jonathan, it is however runing out of NIGERIA ESPECIALLY if the National Conference fails. Let no one deceive themselves that things will be alright because it wont’t, or it will be bussiness as usual. He is as best a President Nigeria will ever get and he personally has nothing to lose. Bestman \nNO, President Jona is running out of Goodluck kwango \nJust ponder on this: National Conference would have been more appropriate if the opposition party had also ruled with their ideas and failed. To disorganise or destroy Nigeria because of the failure of the ruling PDP is unjustified. National Conference should not be a party affair. This is equivalent to an estranged lover pouring acid on his/her ex just to prevent him/her from living a happy and useful marital life afterwards. When has the failure of PDP become the failure of Nigeria? Just as some states experience leadership from opposing parties, so shall Nigerians want to experience same before we conclude that the foundation must be restructured?. The same military that produced an Abacha also produced a Murtala. The same judicial system that acquitted Ibori also jailed Tafa Balogun. The same democracy that produced a Governor Ohakim also produced a Governor Fashola. The same federal government that is covering the abuse of office of an Aviation Minister -Stella Odua is the same that sacked an Internal Affairs Minister -Afolabi. The same Nigeria that had 20 airplanes at Nigeria Airways in 1982 is the same that couldn’t manage an airline in 2007. Only leadership makes the difference. It is wrong for PDP to alter the federal structure simply because they lack the capacity to provide solution to its problems. The same USA that produced eloquent and motivating leaders like Kennedy also produced uninspiring leaders like Bush. If some intelligent Nigerians devoid of selfish ambition at that time could not produce a better constitution than 1999, I do not imagine this crop of selfish leaders can produce a credible amendment. THE NIGERIAN CONSTITUTION IS NOT PERFECT BUT GOOD ENOUGH TO EMPOWER A DEVOTED AND CHARISMATIC LEADER TO PRODUCE A MODERN SOCIETY WHERE EVERY CITIZEN CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND PROVIDED FOR. The N11 billion budgeted for a National Conference anticipated to last for 6 months can provide unemployment allowance for all unemployed graduates in Nigeria for not less than 3 years. What a wasteful country? I am afraid we may end up proposing solutions that don’t solve. What we need is a leadership conference involving a meeting between PDP and APC chiefs with the governors and the president to discuss the leadership question and make a joint statement and declaration condemning terrorism, corruption, ethnic bigotry and encouraging citizens to freely belong to any political association they wish in line with the tenets of freedom and democracy; enjoining the security structure to defend and protect every Nigerian irrespective of where he lives in the country.
