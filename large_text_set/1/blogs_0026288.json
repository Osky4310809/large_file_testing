Now, just in time for my Oscar movie marathon, Apple is prepping a watchOS update, version 3.2, that will include Apple's own version of Theater Mode (note the spelling difference).\nThis is how Theater Mode on the Apple Watch might look. The screen are not yet official.\nImage: Apple\nInformation about how Theater Mode will work. Also not final.\nImage: Apple\nTheater Mode will let Apple Watch owners keep the screen and sounds off for the duration of the movie â€” even if you raise your hand, the watch screen won't wake. You will still, however, feel notifications through haptics. If you want to view one, you can tap the screen or press the watch's digital crown.\nWatchOS 3.2 will offer some other updates including access to SiriKit . Introduced last year, SiriKit will give developers direct access to key Siri functions like calling, messaging and photo search. App developers will be able to tap into these calls through their apps, which means Apple Watch users can, when in these apps, utilize Siri for voice-activated functions.\nWhile Apple is not saying when watchOS 3.2 will come to Apple Watch users, I just hope it's before the Academy Awards ceremony on Feb. 26.\nBONUS: Transform your smartphone into a tiny boombox with this speaker phone case", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/70SVl9J2.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/99fJSF3_R09gycZDIYQA2xr8uIc=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366492%2F439682ba-74f1-427e-84e9-20866ab42d4e.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DcqlGorCuMz1WGeAwsfwKJCrra0=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366489%2Fa1259952-5193-4ed0-b358-71b7a7cbd270.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/70SVl9J2.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-31T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:32:46.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
