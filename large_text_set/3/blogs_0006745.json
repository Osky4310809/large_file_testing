They grabbed victories over West Germany in 1973, beat Croatia at World Cup 2006, and played out a 1-1 draw with Germany at the Olympiastadion in 2004. \nNext year’s matchup will be the Selecao’s final friendlies prior to the announcement of their squad for Russia 2018, providing they secure qualification. \nBrazil could do that this month in matches against Uruguay and Paraguay after coach Tite led the side to six consecutive victories following his June 2016 appointment. \nLast month, Brasil Global Tour announced upcoming friendlies against Australia and Argentina in Melbourne. \nChevrolet Brasil Global Tour", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T20:41:58.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
