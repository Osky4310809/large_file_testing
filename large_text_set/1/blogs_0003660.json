That changes now with the new Notebook Odyssey.\n\nSamsung is stepping up to the portable gaming PC in a big way with the new Notebook Odyssey. This purpose-built machine is Samsung's first proper gaming laptop, and it makes quite the statement in both the design and technology departments.\nInside the Samsung Notebook Odyssey you'll find the latest 7th-generation Intel Core i7 processors, the brand-new NVIDIA GTX 1050 GPU, and at up to 32GB of RAM on the 15-inch or a whopping 64GB on the 17-inch. Both offer dual-drive storage, with your choice of dual SSDs (up to 512GB on the 17-incher) or an SSD + a 1TB HDD. It's not the most powerful gaming laptop we've ever seen, but it's also no slouch. Port-wise you're looking at USB-C/Thunderbolt 3, full-size USB-A (2 on the 15 and 4 on the 17), HDMI, Ethernet, combo audio, and an SD card slot.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:31:45.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
