The matter has been brought to the notice of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), and “remedial action” is being taken.\nThe NSG was raised in 1984 as the federal contingency unit to undertake counter-terror and counter-piracy operations. Its website gives out basic information about the force, its origin and operations.\nToday’s hacking of the NSG website isn’t the first high-profile hack in recent times. Just days ago, cyber attackers from Pakistan compromised the websites of the Cochin and Trivandrum airports. A group of hackers from Kerala responded by hacking Sialkot airport’s (in Pakistani’s Punjab province) website.\nIn addition, a group of hackers called Legion was in the news last month for compromising email and Twitter accounts of several major public figures, including beleagured liquor baron Vijay Mallya and Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi.\nShow hurled at Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in Haryana", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T14:38:42.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
