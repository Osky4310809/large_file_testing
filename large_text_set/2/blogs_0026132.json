Is mediocre coffee so important to you that you need a permanent reminder of the coffee shop you frequent? Is your memory just that bad that you might forget? I can’t understand why people would pay an artist to put a corporate logos on them. So here’s a bunch for you to judge. Maybe you can explain it to me? 1. Oct 30, 2014 at 11:22am PDT 2.
