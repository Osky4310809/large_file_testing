After it was reported that Feist’s new album is called Pleasure and will be released April 28th, the artist took to Twitter to explain her hesitation and inspiration for her first album since 2011’s Metals .\nWhile six years feels like a long time for new music, Feist hasn’t been out of the music scene . As NPR noted, she was in Jenny Lewis’ music video for “She’s Not Me” and she was featured on Peaches’ 2015 album Rub . Plus, she is contributing to Broken Social Scene’s upcoming album .\nBut we are SO excited for something directly from Feist — even if she was apprehensive to share it with the world.

But now that the word is out, she decided to give some intel on the new album.\nSo here's what I can tell you....\nI made this record last winter with 2 of my closest friends, Mocky and Renaud LeTang.\n— Feist (@FeistMusic) March 14, 2017 Feist wrote that she made the album with Renaud Letang , who she has been working with since 2004’s Let It Die . And Mocky started working with Feist during her 2007 breakout album — The Reminder — which featured songs “1234,” “My Moon, My Man,” and “I Feel It All.” So we know Pleasure is gonna be good.\nShe also used Twitter to explain how she was “raw” while recording this new album and says that’s where the name came from.\nI titled the album Pleasure like I was planting a seed or prophecising some brightness.\n— Feist (@FeistMusic) March 14, 2017 You can read her whole message (and admire the gorgeous cover art) about Pleasure on her Instagram.\nMuch to my surprise, I woke up this morning to see the word is out for P l e a s u r e But as Leonard Cohen once said \"the devil laughs at those who make plans.\" I've been so inward facing during the making of this record that I hadn't quite prepared myself to face it, and myself, outward again. So here's what I can tell you.... I made this record last winter with 2 of my closest friends, Mocky and Renaud LeTang. I was raw and so were the takes. Our desire was to record that state without guile or go-to's and to pin the songs down with conviction and our straight up human bodies. I titled the album Pleasure like I was planting a seed or prophecizing some brightness. The experience of pleasure is mild or deep, sometimes temporal, sometimes a sort of low grade lasting, usually a motivator. If the way you look at things is how they look then my motivation is to look with a brighter eye. So there it is, in a nutshell. I'm grateful for your curiosity, the music is en route. Best and soon, Leslie \nA post shared by feist (@feistmusic) on Mar 14, 2017 at 1:34pm PDT \nWe need some brightness planted in our lives, so Feist’s new album coming out in April will certainly help cheer up our spring.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T03:19:34.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
