Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nWe’re seeing more amazing sub-$400 fares to Europe — this time you can fly from Boston (BOS) or New York City (JFK) to Barcelona (BCN), Madrid (MAD) and Porto (OPO) with fares starting at just $376 round-trip. Flights are available for departures from February through May 2017. Although fares in April and May will be a tad bit higher, they’re still a steal for spring travel. This is a great opportunity to visit Portugal, which was listed on TPG’s Best Places to Visit in 2017 ! Make sure you use Google Flights to find your desired itinerary and book fast as these prices will likely go quickly! \nAirline: American, Iberia Route: BOS and JFK to BCN, MAD and OPO Cost: $376+ round-trip in economy Dates: February – May 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T18:01:55.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
