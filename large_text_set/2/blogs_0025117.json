Most Popular By Aaron Goldfarb Feb 22, 2017 In early 1977, in the small village of Brora in the Scottish Highlands, a man named Eric Edmeades put a heavily peated whisky into some American oak hogsheads and European oak butts. Two years later, in the giant town of Manhattan, a baby named Aaron Goldfarb was born at NYU Medical Center. When it was 38 years old, that whisky was finally pulled from its dusty barrels and placed into 2,984 bottles. In February 2017, that boy celebrated his 38th birthday by drinking Brora 38.   Many people will never be fortunate enough to drink a whisky older than them. Once you get into whiskies more than 20 years old, the price often becomes too prohibitive, the availability too sparse. I'm sure some pishers just past bar mitzvah age have secretly raided their parents' liquor cabinet and swigged some Lagavulin 16 Year, and I'm also guessing that was a crummy experience for all involved. But that's not what we're talking about here. For whisky enthusiasts, of which I am one, there are few things more thrilling than celebrating a significant life milestone by drinking a whisky as old as that event. Most Popular So what is it like to drink a whisky older than you? For one, it's going to be costly. Brora 38 goes for $2,200 a bottle, so you can guess what a mere one-ounce dram could run you (I didn't purchase mine). The color of old whiskies might surprise you too—mainly because it's hardly relevant. While you would think the older the whisky the darker the color, that's not always true. Whisky color is mostly determined by barrel char—not to mention some distilleries discreetly using caramel coloring—and Brora 38 has a fairly light golden hue, like a reposado tequila. As for what you most care most about, flavor, I've found that old scotches tend to be very smooth. Now, so-called \"smoothness\" is not usually a positive attribute for whisky drinkers, but there's something about spending an exceedingly long time in barrels that manages to whittle off a whisky's rough and inharmonious edges, that calms all the alcohol heat despite the higher proof (97.2 for Brora 38), and ultimately creates a completely refined spirit that demands sipping slowly. Such is the case with Brora 38, which presents a soft fruitiness backed by earthy campfire notes, but with absolutely no bite.   Of course, you're not drinking old whisky purely for flavor. There's also the philosophical nature of the beast. And that's what I actually like best. While 38-year-old whisky is almost never 20 years more flavorful or $2,000 better than teenaged whisky, its power to affect the mind certainly is. It's utterly humbling to think about what was going on in the world when the whisky in your hand was born. What did the town of Brora look and feel like back in 1977? What was Edmeades doing as he drove to work that day? Was he worrying about the Soviet Union's nuclear program? Was he wearing polyester? Was he listening to the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack on 8-track? \nWhile 38-year-old whisky is almost never 20 years more flavorful or $2,000 better than teenaged whisky, its power in affecting the mind certainly is. Brora 38 had already been resting in its barrels for a year and a half when I entered the world some 3,200 miles away. As I grew, the whisky continued sitting in those 1800s-era warehouses . I'm sure its barrels were moved occasionally, spun and rotated, placed on higher racks and lower dunnages, maybe even tasted every so often. In 1983, the Brora distillery was shuttered for good. In 2005, Edmeades died. But the whisky lived on, a liquid ghost trapped in the barrels of its mothballed distillery. By the time I was 21 and able to legally drink, I'm guessing the Brora 38 tasted pretty good (but I probably still would have still preferred a vodka tonic). It aged on through presidential elections and parliamentary changes, Carter through Obama, Callaghan through Cameron. Through multiple owners even, with Guinness acquiring the dead Brora brand (along with Distillers Company Limited) in 1986, and then industry powerhouse Diageo forming from the merger of Guinness and Metropolitan in 1997. All this to end up in my glass in my Brooklyn apartment some 38 years later. Related Story How to Drink at Every Single Brewery in One State That's what you're getting when you taste old whisky. That's what I was thinking as I savored each tiny sip, my mind filling up like a Wikipedia page. Louis Pasteur once said, \"A bottle of wine contains more philosophy than all the books in the world,\" but he could have just as easily been speaking of old whisky. When you think about all that whisky went through just to get to you—surviving history but in no way affecting it—why, its price almost seems a damn bargain. So how are you going to find an old whisky for yourself? It's going to almost certainly have to be scotch. There are some 20-year-old bourbons on the market, but quite frankly, most aren't very good. The hot summers in Kentucky all but assure bourbon becomes over-oaked and astringent past, let's say, 15 years of age. (Yes, believe it or not, most whisky geeks don't particularly care for the vaunted Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year). Ryes seem to have a lot more staying power at an older age, but very few make it to market in their twenties. (I'd recommend most Willetts in that age range if you can afford and find them.) We're just now starting to see older Irish whiskies, like the new Teeling 24 and 33 Year , both quite good. And there are some super-exclusive Japanese whiskies nearly a half-century old . Getty Unfortunately, I'm now entering an age range where drinking whisky older than me is becoming trickier to find and a hell of a lot more costly (see: 75-year-old scotch for $30,000 !). But old whisky need not have been aged for 38 years exactly. You could also drink a bottle that simply came from a past era. If you can find one. I was once fortunate enough to try a Hannisville Rye, which was distilled in 1912 and put into this giant glass demijohn in 1922. At $300 an ounce, I wish I could tell you it was a disappointment, but it was probably the best thing I've ever drunk. Not a lot of people realize that while wines and beers are constantly changing as they age—losing flavors, gaining oxidization—whisky never changes. So when you're drinking a 1922 rye, you're literally tasting the same thing a person from that era would have tasted had they snatched a brand-new bottle on the way home from, oh I don't know, watching Babe Ruth hit a homerun against the Boston Braves in a game played at the Polo Grounds. You're literally drinking the past as you contemplate your future. Which is the best part of drinking an old whisky on your birthday.
