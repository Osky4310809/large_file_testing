If you’re wondering how safe the bridges in your area are, this web tool can tell you. \nThe tool, from Denise Lu and Dan Keating at The Washington Post , covers every single bridge-covered county in the United States. Mouse over the map to find your county, then give it a click. You’ll be given some quick stats about the county overall, but you can click “See county details” to get an in-depth look at all the bridges in your neighborhood. You’ll see a map with all the bridges in your area, each with their own rating of either “good,” “functionally obsolete,” or “structurally deficient.” Bridges considered “functionally obsolete” or “structurally deficient” aren’t necessarily about to collapse, but they could be unsafe, and bridges in those categories are in need of repair and may have posted load limits.
