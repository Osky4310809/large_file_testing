They began the season at a frantic pace, cramming in more games than any Eastern Conference team consistently over the season’s first two-plus months. \nThey played six sets of back to backs in their first 24 games – and that’s exactly how they’ll end the season. In the middle 34 games of their schedule, the Pistons played only four sets of back to backs. With 46 days left between Sunday’s visit by Boston and the April 12 finale at Orlando, the Pistons will play 24 games – more than one every other day. \n“It’s a tough stretch coming up,” Marcus Morris said after Saturday’s practice. “We’re NBA players. We’re playing for something. At the end of the day, you’ve just got to come and do your job. We’re not the only team that’s got back to backs.” \nIn the last three of those six back-to-back sets, the Pistons will face an opponent on the second night against whom they’re competing for the final three playoff spots in the East: at Chicago on March 22 after playing at Brooklyn the previous night; home against Miami on March 28 after playing at New York; and at Milwaukee on March 31 after hosting Brooklyn. \nIn five of the six back to backs – all but the March 22 game at Chicago – the Pistons play an opponent on the second night of the set that will be fresh, not playing the previous night. And that game at Milwaukee will cap a stretch of four games in five nights, the most grueling schedule test the NBA presents. So in five of their final 24 games – 21 percent of their remaining schedule – the Pistons will face a scheduling disadvantage. \nIf a coach could arrange his own schedule, he’d eliminate back to backs altogether. The ideal is a game every other day, keeping a team on a rhythm and eliminating the duress of back to backs, or three in four nights to the dreaded four in five. \nBut if you had to pick when to play back to backs, the middle of the schedule would be preferable to the start – when coaches covet practice time, which back to backs make all but impossible – or the end, when teams in the playoff hunt need to scratch out every win and teams expecting to be in the playoffs look for every conceivable way to keep legs fresh. \nFor Stan Van Gundy, it requires trying to balance precious practice time to prevent slippage with the need to keep players off their feet. \n“Like Monday, we’ll have to adjust, going a day after a game and headed into a back to back,” he said. “The thing you want to make sure is you’re getting in good work on a fairly regular basis – hopefully at least practice a couple of times a week, hopefully at least one of ’em we’re getting some actual work. That’s important.” \nThe Pistons go into Saturday’s games with a two-game lead on both Milwaukee and Miami for the final playoff berth in the East. At 28-30, they’re one game behind their pace of last year when they finished the season on a 16-9 sprint. At least they go into the condensed final 46 days of the regular season fresh off of the All-Star break. \n“Personally, it helps a lot,” said Morris, who last season smashed his previous career high for minutes played by more than 800 minutes – or the equivalent of nearly 17 full NBA games. “These last couple of games, it means a lot. The last thing I’m worried about is how tired I am or how my body feels.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T09:23:23.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
