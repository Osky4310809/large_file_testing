This year, he teased the audience with the possibility of a tattoo or piercing at a New Orleans bar. In the end, Lemon chose a piercing because Jan. 1 regret is a terrible thing. \nSadly for the viewing audience, Brooke Baldwin made Lemon keep his shirt closed, so Kathy Griffin’s shouted request for a nipple piercing was not granted. So, Lemon took a shot (was it real?) and prepared for pain, which came in the form of an ear piercing. He took it like a champ, grimace and all.\nOne year ago, Lemon made headlines by complimenting Kathy Griffin’s “rack” while drinking away the evening near a hot tub . This year, Lemon was even more ready to rumble, and this prep photo is pretty darn great.\nSo the tattoo/piercing artist is here w/ me & @brookebcnn . Which will it be & where?

Anything is possible on an evening when Van Jones plops a kiss on Jeffrey Lord’s cheek.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T06:53:31.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
