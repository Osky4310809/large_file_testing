He was three years without holiday. He’s fit, young, he was just two or three weeks not training so I don’t think we’re going to need to spend too much time to get him fit.\" \nVIDEO: Giroud scores sensational scorpion kick for Arsenal \nCity travel to West Ham for an FA Cup third-round clash on Friday night, which could provide Guardiola with an opportunity to put Jesus in his squad for the first time. \nThe Blues then face Everton away and Tottenham at home in the Premier League, before a potential fourth-round FA Cup game at the end of January.
