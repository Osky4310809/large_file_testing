Under the new Google review system, material supporting the current president of the United States could well be flagged as “offensive” simply because a liberal “quality rater” disagrees with a political point of view.   \nAnd that, right there, is the problem. It is so easy to move from actual offensive stuff — pornography, actual racism, religious extremism, promotion of violence — to stuff that only is offensive to the reader, like voting for President Donald Trump and/or supporting his policies. (Or supporting any ideas that happen to be outside the liberal agenda of the moment — say, traditional marriage, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, the list goes on.) \nThat’s just plain scary. \nWe have seen what liberals can do when they’re given the freedom to punish what they consider to be “ offensive .” And it’s not good. \nStay vigilant. Whether it’s the Conservative Tribune or otherwise, keep an eye on your Google searches. If you can’t find us on stories we run, let Google know how you feel about being manipulated; you can do that here .
