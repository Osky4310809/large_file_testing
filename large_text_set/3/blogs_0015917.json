In particular, one woman there shocked everyone by admitting she was close to 40 years old, when most people there thought she looked closer to 25.\nThe group then started taking turns around the table sharing their ages, and after I sheepishly muttered, \"31\" — bracing myself for the gasp and \"Oh, but you look so young!\" response it usually elicits — they all just nodded their heads, and someone said, \"Yeah, that makes sense; I would have guessed that.\"\nImage Source: MTV\nI wish there had been a hidden camera to capture my utter and complete shock. I was quite literally stunned into silence for a good 15 minutes. This had NEVER happened before. It was like my entire identity had just been flipped upside down with a single sentence. I know I'm being dramatic, but let me give you a little background.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media2.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/de8-La7SIPrTRSdSSQJIZvSIsQM/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/04/18/046/n/1922398/42b11e27684f88b5_IMG_5671.jpg", "http://www.mtv.com/", "https://media2.popsugar-assets.com/files/2016/04/18/938/n/1922398/e896e430b20579c5_surprised-zoom.xxxlarge.gif"], "published": "2017-03-20T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:43:11.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
