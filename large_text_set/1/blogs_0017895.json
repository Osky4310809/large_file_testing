While many of these checks are currently in use at existing plants, including visual and durability inspections and a process for ensuring that voltage leaks are not prevalent, the company is implementing four brand new tests, including the very uncommon and expensive task of X-raying all of its phones prior to shipping them to consumers.\n\nSamsung believes that any and all of these four new tests, which will run across its entire phone lineup and not just its flagships, would have caught the manufacturing defects present in both sets of Galaxy Note 7 batteries. The company also plans to run what's known as an \"accelerated aging\" test on its phones, which will \"simulate two weeks of real-world usage in five days,\" according to the Wall Street Journal .\nThe fact that Samsung experienced such a broad series of battery misfortunes in a short period is both disconcerting and frustrating, but based on a survey Android Central performed in October , many customers feel comfortable putting the debacle behind them, and look forward to future Samsung devices.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 7 Galaxy Note 7 fires, recall and cancellation: Everything you need to know Survey results: Samsung users stay loyal after Note 7 recall Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review The latest Galaxy Note 7 news Join the Note 7 discussion in the forums!
