Dumlao (philstar.com) | Updated February 13, 2017 - 10:09am The Army's 54th Infantry Battalion said the guerrillas were part of the Ifugao-based Nona del Rosario Command. File photo BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – A soldier and several communist guerrillas were hurt in fresh clashes in remote Asipulo town in Ifugao Sunday evening. The Philippine Army’s 54th Infantry Battalion said a soldier, whose name is being withheld, was wounded in a gunfight with communist rebels that lasted for more than an hour at Barangay Namal in Asipulo at around 6 p.m. Sunday. Army Capt. Jefferson Somera, civil military operations officer of the 54th IB, said government troops seized an M653 assault rifle and a magazine from the guerrillas of the Ifugao-based Nona del Rosario Command of the Ilocos-Cordillera Regional Committee (ICRC). Government forces believe the New People's Army fighters, who were caught unaware when they closed in, suffered more casualties based on blood stains in the encounter area. Retreating rebels who might have taken their wounded comrades away managed to evade the pursuing government troops under cover of darkness, Capt. Somera said. Army Lt. Col. Nicolas Quemado Jr., battalion commander, lauded his soldiers and told them to remain vigilant. \"Our troops only responded to a tip given by civilians that a group of rebels was conducting banditry in their community causing fear among the tribe, the military commander said, adding, \"this is part of our mandate to secure the people, and we are committed to do it.\" Even after nightfall, government troops undertook clearing and pursuit operations tracking the fleeing rebels towards nearby Mount Capan.
