The US Secretary of State only managed to say that he was also glad to meet his Russian counterpart when the US delegation signaled the media to leave the room, Russian media reported. \n“Why did you shush them out?” Lavrov asked of the unfair treatment of the media by the Americans, Bloomberg quoted him as saying. \nAfter the meeting had concluded, Tillerson gave a short statement, which lasted less than a minute, and refrained from answering any questions. On his way out, the Secretary of State ignored a journalist, who wanted to know if he and Lavrov have met before. \nREAD MORE: Russian FM Lavrov expects to talk to US counterpart Tillerson soon on Ukraine & bilateral relations \nBoth parties described their maiden talks as “productive” and said they were eager to try finding ways of mending Russia-US relations. \n“As soon as the teams in the State Department and the relevant agencies are formed, we expressed readiness to establish contacts,” Lavrov said. \nTillerson, on his part, emphasized that “the US will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical cooperation that will benefit the American people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:48:55.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
