Ward admits Bale is a 'step up' from everything Ireland are used to \n“That shows how far he has come in the last six or seven years. But I think that someone got injured at Spurs and the deal fell through.” \nBale had struggled to make an impact during his first couple of years at Spurs after moving from Southampton but went on to make 23 appearances that season in a more advanced position. \nThe Republic of Ireland are currently top of Group D with 10 points, four more than Wales who are back in third place, having been guilty of cheaply surrendering points from winning positions on more than one occasion. \nBale will be looking to end Ireland’s unbeaten start to qualification, whilst maintaining Wales’, and Doyle is just glad he finds himself at the opposite end of the pitch to the Real Madrid forward. \n“He's an unbelievable player — I would hate to have to mark him!” Doyle added. \n“It's just that natural speed. But you watch all of Wales' highlights and he is in the box heading them as well, stuff that you would not think about. \n“He's got everything, so he's a class player.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:27:59.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
