There's open-area exploration on foot and in your land vehicle, a chance to try combat and complete side-missions. You can meet squadmates, crew and other more nefarious characters. You can even start flirting if someone has already caught your eye. \nOnline reaction to the trial, however, has crystallised around the animation of certain characters and the appearance of graphical bugs. \nBrowse social media today and there are galleries of GIFs and YouTube compilations - some highlighting bugs which are genuinely distracting, some pointing to instances where players haven't liked the game's animation quality: i dont think ill ever get tired of trashing the new Mass Effect pic.twitter.com/jwXxdaRCtU — Nathan Ranney (@RatCasket) March 16, 2017 whos even making this pic.twitter.com/nYzqAX1sb1 — Nathan Ranney (@RatCasket) March 16, 2017 More like Mass Effect: Androids because", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T19:51:03.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
