They also foreshadow that a flower similar to Alice, although red and with thorns on her head, has been this way, hinting that the villainous Red Queen may be ahead.\nAccording to artist Ashley Taylor, it makes sense that Alice would want the scoop from some of the loveliest flowers on Walt Disney World property, those at Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort .\n“The outside of the Polynesian Resort is so beautiful! I’ve always loved the tropical flowers that surround it,” she said. “It’s easy to imagine Alice spending time talking to those flowers.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T16:16:48.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
