They’re the chorus line. Bad form that, BBC 1.’\nSo the band who won Let It Shine are not even the stars of Gary Barlow's Take That musical?

We never said we were casting actors. But they will be front and centre of the musical.’\nRepresentatives for Gary Barlow have been contacted for comment by Metro.co.uk.\nLove this as much as we do?
