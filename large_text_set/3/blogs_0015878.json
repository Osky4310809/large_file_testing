Often in the form of placing a warm, meaty hand on his back and going: pat, pat, pat. \n“My colleagues have generally been coming by and patting me on the back,” King told The Hill late on Thursday . “And a surprising number have said that they pray for me. And, meaning they support me and they agree with me, a surprising number.” \n“I don’t often have members come up and say at the end of the day, ‘I prayed for you this morning,'” he continued. “So they must think I’ve got a lot of arrows in my back.” \nThat said, a handful of King’s colleagues in the House did try to put some distance between themselves and his comments. As a particularly rousing example, when confronted with his colleague’s white supremacist talking points, House Speaker Paul Ryan said, through a spokesperson, that he “clearly disagrees” with King’s remarks.

Carlos Curbelo, a representative from Florida, said he approached King: “I saw him down at conference, and I said, ‘Hey, I just want to know if I’m somebody else’s baby.’” \nThey apparently exchanged phone numbers to talk it over. \n“So he sent me his number and we agreed we’d talk whenever we both have time to sit down and talk about it,” Curbelo said. \nIf they do chat, Curbelo may want to bone up a little on King’s record of saying extremely racist things in public and somehow getting repeatedly reelected anyway .
