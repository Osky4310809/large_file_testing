In the movie, Johanssen, who plays Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg with enhanced neural and physical capability, rides the NM4 Vultus on the streets of Tokyo in pursuit of the Puppet Master. \nDeveloped under the keywords of “neo-futuristic” and “cool”, the Honda NM4 was launched in April 2014. Using a 670 cc EFI parallel-twin engine mated to a dual-mode six-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) gearbox, the NM4 is claimed to put out 54 hp at 6,250 rpm and 68 Nm of torque at 4,750 rpm. \nAn LCD instrument panel that changes colour to suit rider preference, cycling through a range of 25 shades, the NM4 Vultus can have the screen matching the paint-job. The adjustable rider back-rest allows for the rider to customise the seating position. \nComing with dual 16-litre integrated storage compartments, the Honda NM4 also features a flip-down passenger seat, giving the scooter a sleek single-seater look. Weighing in at a fairly substantial 245 kg, the NM4 puts the rider a low 650 mm off the ground. \nAs depicted on-screen, the Honda NM4 Vultus will be on display at the 33rd Osaka Motorcycle Show 2017 on March 18. It will make a second appearance at the 44th Tokyo Motorcycle Show on March 24.
