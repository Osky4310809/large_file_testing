Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nKhloe Kardashian's ex James Harden has slammed their relationship, saing he \"didn't get anything\" out of it. \nThe NBA star dated the Keeping Up With the Kardashians beauty for eight months in 2015 - a year he's now branded the \"worst\" period of his life - but has admitted he hated the unwanted attention he attracted because he was dating the reality TV star. \nWithout naming the reality star, he said: \"I didn't like all the attention. I feel like it was for no reason. I wasn't getting anything out of it except my name out there and my face out there, and I don't need that.

I like knowing I'm not going to see myself [on the cover of tabloid magazines]. It feels good.\" Read More When does Keeping Up With The Kardashians return for season 13, what happens and how can I watch in the UK?

It's really good. I feel really happy and secure and I'm just in a really positive, healthy relationship.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:25:05.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
