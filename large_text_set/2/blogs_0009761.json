Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDanny Dyer has a lot to get off his chest on his upcoming episode of Parenting for Idiots. \nThe man who plays Eastenders pub landlord Mick Carter has three children he dotes upon in reali life: daughters Danni, 20 and Sunnie, 9, as well as a three-year-old son named Arty. \nHe talks about wanting to have a son after two daughters because he found getting bikinis onto Barbie dolls impossible - \"Honestly, it's graft mate.\" \nHe also accidentally reveals the truth about Father Christmas in front of at least one watching daughter. Danny Dyer is totally flummoxed by doll's houses, and also their swimwear (Photo: Channel 4) Danny CANNOT get his 'nut' round homework. We think that means 'head'. (Photo: Channel 4) Read More \nHomework leaves Danny almost incandescent with confusion: \"I was like, I can't do it! I cannot get my nut around it.\" \nHe cites one particular piece of take-home study, which asked his child to \"Name seven magnets.\" \nDanny almost melts down at this, claiming: \"There's only one, there's a fridge magnet and no other magnet!\" Danny can't stand the small talk he has to make on the school run (Photo: Channel 4) Read More \nIt seems unlikely that this would be a homework question, so it's likely that Danny's remembering the question wrongly - making his meltdown all the funnier. \nHe then demands that the interviewer names seven magnets. Alright, mate. \nLastly, Danny lays into the pure horror of the school run, where making small talk is mandatory. He hates that. \nPoor Danny.
