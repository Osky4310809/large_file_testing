The wounded were taken to hospital. \nAt the checkpoint, two officers survived unharmed, the officials said. There were unconfirmed reports that a number of security personnel were seized and abducted by the gunmen. \nThe garbage truck had been stolen days earlier from the municipality of el-Arish, the officials said, adding that the militants had built in metal plates to enforce the truck. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters. \nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which bore all the hallmarks of Egypt's Islamic State affiliate. \nThe Sunni militant group has carried out scores of attacks against security forces in the volatile northern Sinai and elsewhere in the country. \nThe Egyptian army has struggled over the past few years to contain the insurgency.
