More had been filed since the program started in 2006. \nThere will also be an expansion of compromise settlement program to cover those cases still pending, while BIR works to become “more aware of the benefits” of exchange of information. \nMeanwhile, under taxpayer satisfaction, the ongoing review of previous issuances and tax rulings as well as simplification of tax forms will continue. \nThe Duterte government embarked on a review of past regulations that it believes put “unnecessary burden” on taxpayers. Most of those reviewed, however, were retained after study and after revenue growth slowed. \nIn addition, improving BIR information technology systems will also be continued, the circular stated. \n“Provide taxpayers additional options or facilities to pay taxes using credit/debit/prepaid cards and mobile payments,” it said. \n“Strengthen registration database in order to allow taxpayers to register and update their registration data online,” the circular said. \nBetter stamps to monitor excise taxes from tobacco and liquor products will likewise be put up. \nLooking inward to “recapture public trust,” BIR will also push for legislation to exempt its officers and employees from the Salary Standardization Law to avoid corruption. \nRecruitment of 996 new staff personnel will also be fast-tracked, while an “integrity management program” will be applied to “relieve/transfer” or “remove” erring personnel. \n“All bureau offices are therefore enjoined to align their respective activities and projects to these priority programs to reduce the opportunities for corruption in the revenue service...,” the circular said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:29:04.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
