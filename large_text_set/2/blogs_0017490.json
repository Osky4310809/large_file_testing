Rene Saguisag. Philstar.com/ AJ Bolando, File \nMANILA, Philippines — The government’s decision to hold a subdued anniversary celebration of the EDSA People Power Revolution should not come as a surprise considering that President Rodrigo Duterte was not really part of the opposition during the time of the Marcos regime, former Sen. Rene Saguisag said. \nSaguisag said that he never heard of any “Atty. Digong Duterte” who was part of the resistance movement from 1972 to 1986 even if his mother was a member of it. \n“That is unfortunate but it’s not unexpected. Pero I never heard of Atty. Digong Duterte. He was not part of the opposition nun the mother was. Among the many prominent lawyers from Davao, not a word we heard about him,” Saguisag said. \nMalacañang earlier announced that the rites commemorating the 31st anniversary of the 1986 People Power Revolution would be “very simple and very quiet.” \nREAD: EDSA revolt rites to be ‘simple, quiet’ \n“It’s time to move on from just celebrating the past, remembering the past and to move on into the whole aspect of nation building, to give it a more positive outlook and... a more positive understanding,” presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said.   \nMalacañang also announced a shift in theme from remembering to moving on. This year’s celebration’s theme is “A Day of Reflection: Celebrating People Power for Nation-building.” \nVice President Leni Robredo was saddened by the decision of the government, saying that the celebration deserves more than a simple and quiet commemoration. \nREAD: Palace allots P1 M for EDSA rites; Leni saddened \nThis year’s simple celebration comes months after the surreptitious burial of the remains of dictator Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. Despite protests from human rights groups and victims of martial law, Duterte still allowed the burial, arguing that since Marcos was a former president and commander in chief, he deserved to be interred there. Duterte to skip EDSA rites? \nMalacañang also announced that the celebration would be held at military headquarters Camp Aguinaldo and not at the People Power Monument as was done in the past. \nThe Palace, moreover, could not confirm the chief executive’s attendance in the commemoration. \n“Well, I suppose so… I haven’t heard anything to the contrary,” Abella replied when asked if Duterte would show up at the event. \nFor Saguisag, however, it will neither be a surprise if Duterte decides to skip the celebrations. \n“Siya ang nagdala sa libingan ng mga bayani without changing the name. Dahil 'yun nga wala siya dun sa movement ng anti-dictatorship. One of the first things he did was to move the remains. Kaya salamat sa kanya nabuhay itong anti-Marcos, anti-dictatorship movement,” Saguisag said at the relaunch of the book “Conjugal Dictatorship.” \nFormer human rights commissioner Etta Rosales offered a different explanation for Duterte’s possible non-attendance. She said that probably the president didn’t feel happy because Marcos, a person he admired, was ousted by the Filipino people. \n“If he doesn’t go to Camp Aguinaldo, medyo halatang-halata na siguro na talagang ayaw niya makibahagi sa isang national recognition,” she said. Rosales said that the government should be celebrating instead of reflecting on the lessons of the Edsa Revolution. \nShe said that the peaceful uprising that toppled Marcos resulted in the ratification and promulgation of the 1987 Constitution should be a cause for celebration. \n“We have been reflecting over the past 40 years. Right now we should be celebrating and we should celebrate the voice of the people,” she said. \n“The Edsa Revolution was the will of the people and the people’s aspirations were written in a framework called the 1987 Constitution which was ratified by some 76 percent of the entire population. That in fact should be celebrated and should be made known to our people,” she added.
