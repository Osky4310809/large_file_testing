Recognising this, Honda has premiered its Riding Assist motorcycle, that reduces the possibility of falling over at zero forward speed. \nShown during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, USA, Honda’s Moto Riding Assist is part of its “Cooperative Mobility Ecosystem” that also includes the NeuV – new electric urban vehicle – automated vehicle concept. Technology for Riding Assist is derived from Honda’s UNI-CUB, a self-balancing personal mobility device. \nEschewing the use of gyroscopes for balance – which add weight and complexity to a machine – Riding Assist lowers the angle of the front fork when the bike is moving at less than five km/h. A servo makes minute adjustments to the handlebars to ensure the bike always stays upright, with or without the rider. \nWhile it is doubtful that Riding Assist will make its way to the mainstream – part of the reason why motorcycles are motorcycles is the amount of rider involvement – such technology could play a part in the development of future robotics. In the meantime, watch the video below for the weirdness of a motorcycle following someone along like a puppy. Coming with diverse and extensive experience in heavy engineering, Mohan enjoys making anything with wheels go fast, especially motorcycles. His weapon of choice is the Desmoquattro engine, and he has a penchant for anything with a dash of Italian design. Strangely enough, he insists he's a slow rider.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T11:05:13.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
