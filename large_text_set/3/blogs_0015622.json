And while many wrestling fans thought this was a possible — and welcome — move, nothing had been confirmed in stone. \nNow, however, the story has changed completely, as Forbes has confirmed that AJ Styles, while fired from the company, is heading over to Monday Night Raw . \nResults from the WWE live event in Amherst, MA: John Cena vs. AJ Styles, Bray Wyatt vs. Luke Harper https://t.co/S6lkBmNn6j pic.twitter.com/DAiGN8znKV \n— WreactDown (@WreactDown) March 20, 2017 \nAccording to their WWE news report, the goal of the company was to make this firing happen towards the end of WrestleMania promotion season. This, then, would make it easier for AJ Styles to transfer easily to Raw , while allowing Reigns to transition over to SmackDown without much fanfare. \nAnd there’s an added benefit to bringing Styles into the Raw stable, too: for Stephanie McMahon to spite her older brother. Escandalo! \n“If Stephanie McMahon kicked off Monday’s Raw by announcing she has signed Styles to spite her older brother, it would capture the spirit of the memorable first episode of Monday Nitro.” \n???? CM Punk \n— ???? Batalla Épica???? (@Batalla_Epica) March 17, 2017 \nAnd the Forbes report is confirmed by the latest WWE news from WhatCulture , who suggested that while the move may be good for Styles, it wouldn’t necessarily be good for Reigns. Reigns, according to the site, would be moving to the blue brand that — dollar for dollar — has fewer numbers in terms of viewers than the red brand. \nThe idea, however, is that Reigns would take the viewers with him when he moves to the Tuesday night lineup. \nFor AJ Styles, too, this would be a perfect opportunity for him to get in front of a larger audience, and to turn face in the company . \n“If the move goes down, Reigns would have the likes of The Miz, Baron Corbin, Randy Orton and Bray Wyatt to work with. Styles would have Kevin Owens, Seth Rollins, Sami Zayn, Braun Strowman, and perhaps a money match with Brock Lesnar to look forward to. If they turn Styles face, he could be the top star on the brand in no time.” \n— AJStyles-Source.Ꮯom (@AJStylesSource) March 10, 2017 \nBut in order for all of this to get pulled off without a hitch, according to the latest WWE news report from Bleacher Report , AJ Styles’s face-off against Shane McMahon must be the headlining match at WrestleMania . \nAccording to the outlet, Styles’ career — and his resume — lend themselves to him becoming deserving of a headlining spot on wrestling’s biggest night. And while Shane McMahon’s wrestling style leaves much to be desired — especially now that he’s older, and doesn’t have a good style — his name, of course, would be enough for him to coast by on wrestling’s biggest stage. He is a McMahon, after all . \n“Not only does Styles deserve that spotlight, he also would help guarantee that ‘Mania had a headline match worthy of the show’s history. Just as Shawn Michaels was always the man WWE turned to for a fantastic match, Styles could certainly take on the role of Mr. WrestleMania with ease.” \nWhat do you think of this latest round of WWE news?
