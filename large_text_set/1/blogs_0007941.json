The company and its bombastic CEO John Legere made these announcements today at CES 2017 .\nSee also: Best T-Mobile Android phones 3 weeks ago Starting on Jan. 22, the carrier will only be selling its T-Mobile ONE unlimited plan to new customers (existing customers can still stick with their current plans if they want). T-Mobile also promises that if they advertise a $40 a month plan, it will cost customers $40 a month, with all taxes and surcharges included in the advertised price.\nEven if you don’t really need unlimited data, the new T-Mobile ONE plan will also offer those customers something called KickBack. If a customer uses 2 GB of data or less in a month, they will get up to $10 in credit in the next bill cycle. These changes are supposed to simplify bill payment at T-Mobile.\nOf course, all of this sounds good, but you can bet that if customers do see an odd surcharge on their next bill under this new setup, it will look like T-Mobile is just hyping up something that doesn’t really exist. Hopefully, Legere will make good on these claims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:53:50.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
