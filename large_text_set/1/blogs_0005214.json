An E! video took us behind the scenes of her dress fitting, and both of them are stunning. \nMetz says she was really excited to work with Siriano on her dress, and who wouldn't be? He's made beautiful gowns for quite a few Hollywood stars— famously for those who aren't sample-sized —and both the final results and the women wearing them should make other designers envious that they weren't the ones dressing these ladies. After all, who can forget the sleek, sexy gown he designed for Leslie Jones at her Ghostbusters premiere? \nSiriano says that \"one is more classic, more elegant, and the other is maybe a little bit more fashion,\" which is designer code for \"fierce AF.\" As Metz models them, it turns out the classic one is long and crimson, with lace sleeves and a beaded bodice—totally red-carpet worthy. Her second option is a blue-green, one-shoulder dress with a cape-like, accordion-pleated drape over the left shoulder (the pleating is echoed by part of the skirt beginning at the waist). \nCheck out both looks here: \nFrankly, we don't know how she's going to decide—but Metz will definitely be looking gorgeous tomorrow night. \nRelated Stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T01:29:34.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
