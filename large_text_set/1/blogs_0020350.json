The rest of the passengers see this sort of thing on a daily basis, so the wow factor of it has evaporated. Things get a bit nerve wracking when the villain damages the tracks, but luckily, the red-clad heroine is there to catch the derailed train. \nEmily Locke lands her dream job as Director of Research and Development for Wayne Security in Charm City, home to super heroes and villains and citizens fed up with the collateral damage of their constant fighting. Full of confidence and big ideas, Emily quickly learns that her aspirations far exceed those of her new boss and officemates, so it will be up to her to lead the team toward their full potential and the realization that you donâ€™t need superpowers to be a hero. \nThe cast: Vanessa Hudgens, Alan Tudyk, Danny Pudi, Christina Kirk, and Ron Funches. \nJustin Halpern, Patrick Schumacker, Len Goldstein, Marc Buckland and Dean Lorey are executive producers of Powerless . Buckland served as the director of the pilot. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television and is based on the characters from DC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:40:44.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
