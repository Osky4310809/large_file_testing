Skanska, a Swedish firm that is one of the construction industry’s largest, publicly snubbed the project. “We believe in openness and equality,” declared its chief executive, Johan Karlstrom. The big American bidders try to downplay the politics. Howard Nye, the boss of Martin Marietta, a materials giant based in North Carolina, says simply that his company has “a general interest in large infrastructure projects”. Its shares and that of other construction firms have risen as a result of Mr Trump’s pledge to lavish $1trn on infrastructure across the country. Those plans may be delayed, but not, it seems, the wall. For some smaller bidders, business and personal views are aligned. Michael McLaughlin of Greenfield Fence, a contractor based near San Diego, says the barrier is needed to keep “dangerous drug dealers” out of the country. The general requirement is for a wall that is at least 5.5 metres high, preferably 9 metres, with anti-climb and anti-tunnelling features, and which—on the American side, at least—is “aesthetically pleasing”. The few dozen firms that make it to the second round will later present detailed drawings and technical specifications as well as their best price. At the end of the process a still unknown number of winners will each be awarded a contract with a maximum value of $300m. The rules of the game clearly favour large engineering and construction firms such as KBR, which helped build the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay and which will probably bid, or Kiewit, from Nebraska. These companies have the best design expertise, top-notch construction-management teams and the ability to strong-arm materials suppliers. But smallish players could still turn a profit by signing up to be subcontractors to bigger, prime contractors. Andrew Dorfschmidt of McDirt Excavation, a family-owned business in South Dakota, hopes to sell digging services to whichever companies are awarded the government contract. Other firms are not interested in building the wall itself but are looking to sell border-wall accessories that are known as “tactical infrastructure and technology”. These include lighting, standing platforms and remote video-surveillance systems. One such firm, 2020 Surveillance, assumes there will be cameras placed every 60 metres along the wall. At a licensing fee of a few hundred dollars per camera per year it would expect to make $10m in revenue every year the wall is in place, if it supplied surveillance for the whole length required, or about 1,000 miles (1,610km). Despite the strong expression of interest from potential bidders, the construction schedule could be unpredictable. For one thing, company bosses note that the wall will run through many parcels of private land. Although eminent-domain laws, which force the transfer of private property into public hands, may be invoked by the government, agreeing on adequate compensation for evicted landowners often becomes a legal headache. Receiving payment could also take time. Only a small fraction of the estimated total cost of building the wall has been ring-fenced under Mr Trump’s “skinny” budget proposal. Mexico has disobligingly ruled out paying for it. Delay may not matter to everyone, however. Working on Mr Trump’s pet project is probably a good way to get a slice of a broader infrastructure splurge, if and when it comes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:32:05.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
