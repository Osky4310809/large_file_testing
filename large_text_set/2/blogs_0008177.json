He was 95. \nTipper received a Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for his service during World War II and D-Day. In 2011, the French government bestowed on him the French Legion of Honor medal , the country’s highest honor. \n“We didn’t talk about the war,” his daughter, Kerry Tipper, wrote on Facebook on Feb. 3. “This is the piece I want those of you that didn’t know him personally to understand. His greatest sense of pride and accomplishment came from being a loving son to his mother. It came from his near 30 years of teaching. From his years traveling the world. And finally, from the 34 years he gave to his small, but adoring family.” \nBorn in Detroit in 1921, Edward Tipper was raised in one of the city’s working-class neighborhoods, although he spent a brief period living in Ireland with his parents. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he tried to enlist in the Marine Corps but was denied because he had an overbite. So he volunteered for the 506th parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. The adventures of the Easy Company became the basis of “Band of Brothers.” \nOn June 12, 1944, Tipper was clearing a house when a mortar shell exploded near him, injuring his right eye and breaking his legs. He spent a year in army hospitals. \n“(Easy Company was) in a way a little embarrassed that their group got attention, that theirs was spotlighted when there were so many other groups that did incredible things and made sacrifices,” Kerry Tipper said during a phone interview. \nWhen her father was discharged, he was severely injured and obviously disfigured, she said. Doctors gave him a list of activities he couldn’t do, such as driving and sports requiring depth perception. But for Edward Tipper, that became a checklist. \n“He was defiant above all,” Kerry Tipper said. “He just refused to accept people’s limitations.” \nAs an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, Edward Tipper became an avid handball player. “He didn’t really care about handball,” she said. “He just wanted to be able to do it.” \nTipper earned a master’s degree in education at the University of Northern Colorado, then the Colorado State Teachers College. Kerry Tipper said her father loved Colorado and was an avid skier well into his 80s.
