Barcia/Rappler \nLIGAO CITY, Philippines – A Catholic bishop is calling on the youth to speak out online against the death penalty and the spate of extrajudicial killings in the country. \nBishop Joel Baylon of the Diocese of Legazpi addressed participants of the 8th Diocesan Youth Way of the Cross at Kawa-Kawa Hill in Ligao City, Albay on Saturday, March 11. \n\"Use your capacity to post on social media against extrajudicial killings, death penalty, and be online missionaries of God,\" Baylon said. \nFrom July 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017, there were 7,080 people killed in the Duterte administration's war on drugs , both from police operations and vigilante-style killings. From March 6 to 12 this year, or when the campaign was relaunched, 14 more deaths were recorded. \nBaylon said the killings are not the solution to the country's drug problem. \n\"We do not wish the sinners to die... because they [can be brought] back to the fold of law and of God. We are hoping that peace should reign again,\" he said. \n\"To the youth, don't welcome drugs because it will not help you, but destroy you. So, influence your friends not to take drugs,\" he added.

It was recently approved by the House of Representatives on 3rd and final reading, but is expected to be challenged in the Senate . \nLeaders of the Catholic Church in the Philippines have been vocal about opposing both the death penalty and extrajudicial killings.

Barcia/Rappler \nThe bishop conducted a dialogue with the youth instead of the usual homily during Mass to allow selected participants from various parishes to ask questions. \nThe 8th Diocesan Youth Way of the Cross had the theme \"United in Faith, Restoring All Things in Christ\". \nThe event is held every year during the first week of the Lenten season, with devout Catholics from all over Albay trekking to Kawa-Kawa Hill. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
