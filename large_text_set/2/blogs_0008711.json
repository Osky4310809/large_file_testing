The allegations have since been disproven. \nLast April a jury found that the 96 victims had been “unlawfully killed” after a 27-year campaign by the families of those who died. What happened at Hillsborough? \nTotal Eclipse of the S*n campaign group have long campaigned for a widespread boycott of the newspaper, which is not stocked in many Merseyside newsagents. \nThey tweeted: “Further to conversations with LFC Directors we are happy to inform you that s*n journalists no longer enjoy access to all club premises.” Further to conversations with LFC Directors we are happy to inform you that s*n journalists are no longer enjoy access to all Club premises — TotalEclipseOfTheS*n (@totaleclipse96) February 10, 2017 \nA spokesperson for the newspaper said: “The Sun and Liverpool FC have had a solid working relationship for the 28 years since the Hillsborough tragedy. Banning journalists from a club is bad for fans and bad for football. The Sun can reassure readers this won’t affect our full football coverage. \n“The Sun deeply regrets its reporting of the tragic events at Hillsborough and understands the damage caused by those reports is still felt by many in the city. A new generation of journalists on the paper congratulate the families on the hard fought victory they have achieved through the inquest. It is to their credit that the truth has emerged and, whilst we can’t undo the damage done, we would like to further a dialogue with the city and to show that the paper has respect for the people of Liverpool.” Tony Evans comments on Hillsborough disaster's verdict \nThe Sun has not conducted an exclusive interview with Liverpool staff over the past 24 years but have been able to attend matches and press conferences. Last year Jurgen Klopp refused to answer a question from one of the publication’s journalists. \nThe ban is expected to be in place for tomorrow’s visit of Tottenham to Anfield.
