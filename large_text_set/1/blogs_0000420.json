READ MORE: Who are the Rohingya? \n\"Now, according to the initial reports, three police officers were detained,\" Zaw Htay, chief government spokesperson, told DPA news agency on Monday. \"We have rules and regulations for police ... They will be punished according to that police law.\" \nThe video , which contains images some viewers may find distressing, shows police hitting a young boy around the head as he walks to where dozens of villagers are lined up in rows seated on the ground, hands behind their heads. \nThree officers in uniform then start attacking one of the sitting men, beating him with a stick and kicking him repeatedly in the face. \nA Rohingya activist contacted by AFP news agency said the footage had been verified by a refugee from the nearby camp, Shilkhali. \nMyanmar security forces have been accused of extreme violence during security sweeps of villages throughout northern Rakhine, near the country's western border, following deadly attacks on police in October. \nThousands of Rohingya have since fled across the border into Bangladesh.
