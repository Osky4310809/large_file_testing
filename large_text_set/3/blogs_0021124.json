It doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re doing holiday films with the family or working behind the scenes on a multi-million dollar mega-hit – your iOS device can be a major help.\nThough you&apos;re unlikely to see Christopher Nolan&apos;s next film shot on an iPhone, there&apos;s a real chance you might see something at a film festival taken on a 5S, or a local documentary uploaded to sites like YouTube. If you&apos;re just filming something that&apos;s happening around you, the Camera app and iMovie might be all you need to turn it into a great little video. \nThe 30 best iPhone apps for designers But we&apos;ve set our sights bigger in this feature, offering the best apps to help you improve not just the filming of cool stuff, but planning shoots and coming up with ideas.\n01. Horizon Camera Price: Free Works with: iPhone, iPad There&apos;s a special circle of Hell reserved for people who film video in portrait mode. There&apos;s no need for it but still they persist, recording their horrible vertical slices of footage and then posting it online as if it&apos;s somehow acceptable. \nWith Horizon, though, portrait video becomes a thing of the past. Whichever way you hold your device as you film, it&apos;ll record in landscape mode at up to 2K resolution, and as an added benefit you can zoom in and out by tilting your device. New features include 60 and 120FPS slow motion that you can activate with a simple tap and hold, and eight real-time video filters.\n02. Adobe Premiere Clip \nPremiere Clip is a lightweight but useful video editor Price: Free Works with: iPhone, iPad, Android How much of Creative Cloud &apos;s Premiere Pro can you squeeze into a free app? Not a lot, it transpires; Premiere Clip might share a name with Adobe&apos;s mighty desktop editor, but it&apos;s actually a pretty lightweight app for stitching photos and video together on the go.\nWhich is no bad thing. Actually, Premiere Clip carries it all off rather well, with a straightforward drag-and-drop interface that makes it easy to add media as well as transitions and music, and the ability to import custom effects from other CC tools. When you&apos;re done, you can export your finished work to Creative Cloud.\n03. Pinnacle Studio Pro \nFine control of video on your mobile device Price : £12.99/$12.99 Works with : iPhone, iPad As the name suggests, this app pitches itself as a tool for professionals and it definitely lives up to the title. Just like in a desktop video app, you can arrange and rearrange your clips in a storyboard and add transitions, effects and a soundtrack. \nPinnacle Studio Pro gives you precise control over your creation – you can trim individual frames of your video, create slow and fast motion segments, add motion titles, pan and zoom on your photos and edit audio. \n04. Hyperlapse from Instagram \nRocky video gets smoothed out by Hyperlapse Price : Free Works with : iPhone, iPad Hyperlapse uses impressive stabilisation technology to enable you to shoot high quality time-lapse videos without a tripod. It's so good at smoothing out shakes that you can even use it to polish footage taken while you're walking, running or riding on a bumpy vehicle. When your video is complete you can make it up to 12x the original speed.\n05. SloPro \nGet dramatic and create super-slow motion action Price: Free Works with: iPad, iPhone SloPro&apos;s concept seems simple – to let you create slow-motion video – but in practice it&apos;s a little more complicated than that, as all good cinematographers will tell you.\nLet&apos;s start with the easy part: if you have an iPhone, it lets you record video at 60 frames per second, instead of the usual 30. This means you can slow the video down to half-speed, and it&apos;ll still look as smooth and fluid as normal. It works really well, and is superb for mid-speed motion (think people playing football rather than swinging a golf club)\nBut using various clever techniques, it can also slow down video from other devices to that speed – just not as crisply – or slow the video from any device to other slower speeds, including to a ridiculous 500 or even 1000 frames per second, making every move appear to run at positively glacial speeds. The results will never look as good as the true high-speed recording that you see in sports coverage on TV, but it can be impressive.\nGetting to grips with what the app means by settings such as &apos;Slow&apos;, &apos;Slower&apos; and &apos;Slowest&apos; can takes some fiddling, but it&apos;s generally quite easy to use. There&apos;s a mini editing suite in the app too, so you can trim your footage and decide what speed it should be, then export it to your Camera Roll to use elsewhere if you want.\n06. iMovie \nIt may not be a professional-level video editor, but it’s great for getting a movie into shape Price : £4.99/$4.99 Works with : iPhone, iPad You&apos;re unlikely (to put it mildly) to see iMovie being used to make the next Hollywood blockbuster, but Apple&apos;s video-editing app is ideal for home movies, or short films to go online.\niMovie is a little picky about video formats, but if it&apos;s something you&apos;ve filmed on your iPhone, it should have no problems letting you import the movies files, choosing the bits you want and creating a quick cut of your movie.\nFrom there, you can use the Precision Editor tool, and the Themes and Transitions, to craft and fine-tune your movie. You can add titles, choose from a range of sound effects to add some texture to your film, and add background music from your own library (or compose your own in GarageBand).\nThough iMovie doesn&apos;t do everything, it&apos;s capable of some truly impressive results in a very short amount of time. The interface is intuitive, it&apos;s reliable, and it&apos;s got a great range of export options, including uploading your finished film straight to the net, or sending it to iTunes so you can continue editing on a Mac.\n07. Celtx \nWrite screenplays anywhere with this clever scriptwriting software Price: Free, $8.25 or $16.58 per month Works with: iPad, iPhone, Android There are a few contenders for the scriptwriting crown on iOS, but Celtx&apos;s combination of universal support, cloud support to link to the desktop version of Celtx and useful context-sensitive buttons to quickly build your script means it gets our pick. You can create screenplays, theatre scripts, comic scripts and more, with the on-screen options and layout tailored for each different kind of work.\nThe various buttons make sure that you&apos;re always working in the right way, with different elements of the script laid out in the right place, without you having to worry about alignment or anything like that.\nYou can add notes to areas of your script, which are preserved across the desktop and iOS versions of the app, and if you want to send the script to someone else, it can easily be emailed as text or a PDF, or printed with AirPrint.\nThe scripts themselves are easy to read, and can be resized quickly with just a pinch. The only downside is a lack of support for Final Draft format, but this is more than capable of letting you create an Oscar-winning script on your iPad.\n08. Storyboard Composer \nGet the look and pace of your film right before even picking up a camera Price: £14.99/$14.99 Works with: iPhone, iPad The best films require meticulous planning and preparation, and one of the most important stages in that is storyboarding. Getting the composition of your shots right before you start filming makes a massive difference to their eventual quality, but it&apos;s a lot of work. \nStoryboard Composer makes it slightly easier by enabling you to take photos and import into the app, and then add arrows and notes to indicate what should be happening on screen. You can also indicate what camera moves will be made – such as a zoom or pan – and it will actually animate those on your photo.\nYou can specify how long each shot should last, eventually building a complete skeleton for your film. Storyboard Composer can actually play back what you produce as a video, and you can export the file to use elsewhere.\nIt&apos;s a great way of not just planning your movie, but of getting an idea of the scope involved in making it. It&apos;s not cheap, but for amateur filmmakers it&apos;s very useful.\nNext page: 5 more movie-making apps, including our top pick... \n09. iStopMotion for iPad \nCreate amazing stop-motion and time-lapse video on your iPad Price : £11.99/$11.99 Works with: iPad Stop-motion is a great way of making animations without having to learn to draw, and a good way to make films if you don&apos;t have any actors. In the case of stop-motion, you normally have some models (or toys – stop-motion Lego films are particularly popular) and move them a little on each frame before snapping a picture.\nTime-lapse is a similar idea, but slightly different – you&apos;d normally set up a camera and take a series of photos a set time apart, which you build into a video to show how things change over time.\nThis app offers everything you need to get cracking with this kind of filmmaking, offering crucial features such as a camera overlay, so when you&apos;re lining up the next frame in your stop-motion video, you can see exactly where everything was in the last frame.\nIt&apos;s packed with other features, but perhaps the best part is that you can use an iPhone as a remote-control camera for the main iPad app, which means you can use the iPad&apos;s far superior sensor to get better shots (although obviously not with the original version). It can also export at up to 1080p, so the results look great.\n10. CollabraCam \nCreate a multi-camera studio setup using just iPhones Price : £5.99/$5.99 Works with: iPhone, iPad If you&apos;re trying to film an event live, whether it&apos;s as large as a rock concert or as small and personal as a school play, the best way to ensure you always get a great shot is to have several cameras filming the action all at once.\nCollabraCam creates a professional, multi-camera studio-style setup between iOS devices over a Wi-Fi network. You have one Director, with up to four cameras filming the action and streaming their video to the Director. The Director then chooses which camera should be active, switching between them to ensure that what’s recorded is always from the best angle.\nCleverly, the Director can send cues to the cameras with a tap of a button – for example, to let a camera know that it will become the live one imminently, or to tell the camera to move or capture a different angle.\nThe ideal setup would be to have the Director on an iPad and a new-version iPhone as each camera, but you can mix and match devices as needed. The downside is that final saved video can only be up to 640×480 in size, so you can&apos;t create HD videos. It&apos;s still an extremely clever app, and a potentially powerful one.\n11. FiLMiC Pro \nThis iPhone video camera comes packed with features Price: £14.99/$14.99 Works with: iPhone, iPad, Android FiLMiC Pro is, quite simply, the answer to the frustrations filmmakers have with Apple&apos;s default camera app. The most obvious and immediately useful features are the ability to set the focus and exposure separately, to lock them individually, and to lock the white balance. This is all vital for getting the tone and mood of what you’re filming right, and FiLMiC knows that.\nVideo nuts will find wide-eyed glee in the ability to specify not only what resolution the app films at, but also the frame rate and, best of all, the bitrate, so you can record at quality far beyond the Apple defaults – great if you&apos;re filming lots of motion.\nThere are plenty of other options too, such as framing guides, an on-screen audio meter, colour bars or a slate at the start of each clip, and even the ability to upload your videos to an FTP server or Dropbox, so they&apos;re immediately available.\n12. Vizmato \nMake working with videos more like fun than hard work Price: Free Works with : iPhone, iPad, iPod touch Vizmato is a clever ploy to make video editing less daunting, letting you play clips and use a simple series of buttons and options to apply effects on the fly.\nPlay back a snowboarding video and you can make a section slow-motion by just tapping a button when you get to that part of the video; or add other video filters such as echo or sound effects.\nIt comes across as light and toy-like, but there&apos;s a surprising amount of precision on offer. Every edit you make is displayed in a little timeline, so you can go back and change things if you wanted to do anything slightly differently, or just delete your edit if it&apos;s not working. You can even do some light editing in the app: splitting clips and adding new ones in.\nThis app has a bunch of features that iMovie&apos;s missing, though it&apos;s hardly a replacement when it comes to editing video. It does work with live video though.\n13. Action Movie FX \nGet a bit Michael Bay on your home videos with this simple VFX app Price: Free Works with : iPhone, iPad It should come as no surprise that this app is from the production studio of JJ Abrams, director of The Force Awakens, Star Trek and Super 8. It&apos;s basically a ridiculously easy way to shoot video with some added special effects. The free app comes with a few effects in it, but there are more available with an in-app purchase.\nThe free effects include a missile strike (and subsequent explosion) and a car crashing to the ground. The extra packs include things like flash floods, tornadoes and electrical strikes, so you can put yourself in all sorts of exciting/terrifying situations.\nSadly, you can&apos;t add effects into videos you&apos;ve already shot; you actually have to record from within the app. However, you can export the video to use elsewhere and combine it with other footage, although the output is limited to 720p.\nFurther reading: \n7 free Android apps for creatives The best music videos of 2016 10 creative free iPhone apps for designers ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:00:14.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
