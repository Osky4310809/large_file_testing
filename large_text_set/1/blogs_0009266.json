That was cemented tonight when he picked up the Golden Globe for Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy, and went onstage to issue his usual humble speech of gratitude for everyone who watched the show and for honoring it. \nBut, because he’s Donald Glover, he had one special amendment to the list of usual suspects — he thanked local Atlanta rap trio Migos , not for anything related to the show, but for the creation of “ Bad And Boujee .” Honestly, considering how prevalent “raindrop / drop top” has been in my entire Twitter feed the last couple months, he has a point. Though I do have one quibble, which is over the spelling of “boujee” — now accepted as the standard — due to the popularity of the song. \nAnyway, a lot of people in the room probably had no idea what Glover was talking about, which, of course, is what makes the shout out way better. And the internet had plenty to add to Glover’s somewhat random pronouncement of greatness upon the track.\n\ndonald glover thanked migos so now there's a room full of rich white people so fucking confused right now\n— Shea Serrano (@SheaSerrano) January 9, 2017 \n\"I would like to thank the judges for picking me. The Migos who I love. I love you, Atlanta.\" –Donald Glover\n— Heben Nigatu (@heavenrants) January 9, 2017 \nDonald Glover won a Golden Globe & gave a shoutout to Migos for making Bad and Boujee in his acceptance speech 2017 off to a legendary start\n— Nathan Zed (@NathanZed) January 9, 2017 \nDonald Glover just solidified his place in Black History. Not for winning the award but for shouting out The Migos at the #GoldenGlobes \n— Charlamagne Tha God (@cthagod) January 9, 2017 \nBad & Boujee is so good I'm mad Donald Glover is the only person who thanked Migos tonight\n— clipping (@clppng) January 9, 2017 \nHe went up there and thanked black people & Migos for Bad & Bougie.
