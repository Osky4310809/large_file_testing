But I can tell you that N7 billion was paid to PENCOM at the end of December,” the source said. \nAlso, a source at PENCOM told our correspondent that a lot of retirees blamed the commission because they did not understand that the funds were not managed by the commission, thus its not its fault. \nHe clarified that only people that worked for the Fedaral Government before 2004 had such set back, thus it did not affect the private sector retirees. \n“Whenever we get the money, we compile our list and give the names and money to the PFAs. \n“The simple truth is that it is the Federal Government that is delaying the payment of accrued rights of retirees. \n“Initially we were owing from October 2016, but some funds were released recently and two weeks ago we were able to pay workers that retired from November to December 2016,” the source said. \nThe source revealed that the biggest challenge right now was not just having the bonds cash backed, but rather, how to calculate the accrued pension a retiree was owed. \nHe said that a worker was “retired” at the level he or she was as at 2004 and that whatever was determined to be the person’s accrued pension rights was then converted to bonds which was expected to mature when a worker retired. \nThe source said the bonds were supposed to yield interest and boost the expected amount, yet no significant interest was reflected in the amount remitted for each retiree. \nThe source said each retiree was paid exactly or a little more than what was determined to be his accrued rights as at June 2004. \nMr Mohammed Julde, who worked with the Ministry of Education from 1984 to 2016, called on the Federal Government to heed the cry of its former workers. \nHe said it was not fair for them to suffer this after judiciously serving in the public service. \nHe urged public servants still in service in key departments to assist in resolving the issue as it affected every government worker that had been in the employment of the Federal Government before 2004.
