You might want to check in with me around 2023.\"\nThe Fox News host went on to play audio of Peskov's remarks with a translated voiceover.\nO'Reilly finished his statement by mentioning Washington Free Beacon senior editor Bill Gertz' new book , iWar: War and Peace in the Information Age , as a good source to learn about Putin.\n\"One footnote, if you'd like to know more about the violent history of Vladimir Putin, you might check out the book iWar by Bill Gertz.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:06:58.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
