This is Julie Hirschfeld Davis, and I’m a White House correspondent at The Times. \nToday is White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s first official on-camera briefing with reporters since President Trump was sworn in. It’s always a high-stakes event in the life of any new administration. But this one is particularly fraught, because of an extraordinary episode on Saturday night, when Spicer went to the podium to angrily berate the press for their reporting on the size of Trump’s inauguration crowd. \nHe gave a series of demonstrably false data points pushing back, and didn’t take any questions that night. Today, he will field plenty, and I’ll be here with my White House teammates Peter Baker, Maggie Haberman and Mark Landler to decode and analyze. Julie Hirschfeld Davis To the extent that there was a plan to take advantage of the first days of his administration, when a president is usually at his maximum leverage, President Trump threw it aside. The New York Times White House Correspondent 1:03 PM ET \nAnd good afternoon, everyone. This is Michael Shear, and I’m in the briefing room today, ready for the first briefing. I’ll send some updates once it begins about what it’s like here. Julie Hirschfeld Davis \nLooks like a standing-room-only crowd over there, Mike. What’s the vibe? Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 1:38 PM ET \nYeah, Julie. It’s totally packed. Not like the Josh Earnest briefings toward the end of the Obama era. Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 1:39 PM ET \nLots of anticipation here. No one is quite sure how Sean is going to approach the beginning of the briefing. Will he make reference to Saturday? Will he just jump right into questions? Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 1:41 PM ET \nWe definitely have plenty of them, by the way: health care, trade (T.P.P., Nafta), immigration, ethics and businesses, relations with Congress, the C.I.A. visit, Russia… Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 1:43 PM ET \nIt’s interesting that Kellyanne Conway, the senior counselor, and Hope Hicks, the director of strategic communications, are both in the room for this, in seats usually reserved for junior press staff. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 1:47 PM ET \nSean kicks it off by trying to puncture the tension with some self-effacing humor, saying that he emailed his predecessor, Josh Earnest, last night after checking his Twitter feed and reassured him that his title as most popular White House press secretary is secure at least for the next few days. Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 1:47 PM ET \nWell, there’s the answer: a quick couple of jokes to cut the tension and then right on into the news of the day. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 1:48 PM ET \nWhen Spicer talks about trade policy, it’s worth recalling that he once served as a spokesman to George W. Bush’s trade representative, Susan Schwab. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 1:49 PM ET \nHe made only a glancing reference to the crowd-size fight he picked on Saturday night, saying he had planned to start by recapping the inauguration, but we’ve already been over that quite a bit. But there’s been no acknowledgment of having given false information from the podium or any offer of conciliation. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:52 PM ET \nSpicer’s joke did not seem to get many laughs, as best as I can tell watching remotely. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:53 PM ET \nThe message that Spicer is delivering now about the holdup of Mike Pompeo’s confirmation was the message that Trump was supposed to deliver at the C.I.A. on Saturday. Peter Baker \nHumor is usually a good way to defuse tensions but it felt a little forced. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:53 PM ET \nThis is quite a long topper. Almost as if he realizes that once he stops talking, he’s going to lose control of this forum and have to field a lot of tough questions. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:53 PM ET \nAnd it felt as if it’s going to take a little more than a glancing self-effacement to move on. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:54 PM ET \nThat was the warmest readout of a phone call between an American president and an Egyptian president in years. Maggie Haberman \nJulie, you are so right. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:54 PM ET \nMore joking allusions to the weekend episode from Spicer as he announces the addition of four “Skype seats” in the briefing room: “As you know, we are all about big viewerships and large audiences here…” Maggie Haberman Chief White House Correspondent 1:54 PM ET \nAlways the least candid part of any White House briefing — “I look forward to taking your questions.” Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 1:55 PM ET \nSpicer breaks with the tradition of granting the first question to The Associated Press, and instead goes to The New York Post. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:55 PM ET \nThis is going to be a real test of Spicer’s level of granular knowledge of policy. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 1:55 PM ET \nAnd not just skipping the A.P. but moving off the front row, which in recent years has tended to dominate the first half or more of each briefing. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:55 PM ET \nHe dodged the question from Daniel Halper from The New York Post about whether they will enforce the mandate. Peter Baker \nThe front row includes the big networks and wire services. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 1:56 PM ET \nSecond question goes to the Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent, who asks about the anti-abortion language Trump signed this morning. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:57 PM ET \nOne of Trump’s favorite things is watching how his aides do on TV. He was displeased with how Spicer sounded and looked and the overall performance on Saturday. He is almost certainly watching this right now. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 1:57 PM ET \nHe’s going to reporters on a list, something presidents usually do but press secretaries don’t. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 1:57 PM ET \nCan I confess to being happy we’re not enduring 25 minutes of questions from TV networks? Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 1:57 PM ET \nYes, for all the attention on what will happen in the briefing room, there are some things that could be done to make the briefing better, one of which is to spread the questions around. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:00 PM ET \nGlenn Thrush and I did a podcast before he left Politico in which we characterized Trump as the Page Six President, in honor of the gossip page at The New York Post that he has thrived on and nurtured for decades. The Post got the first question. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:01 PM ET \nAsked what Trump will do about the so-called DREAMers, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. by their parents whom Obama shielded from deportation by executive order, Spicer strongly hints that rescinding that policy is not a priority. He says Trump wants to focus on undocumented immigrants with criminal records or “those who pose a threat to the American people.” Peter Baker \nWhich is pretty close to the Obama policy, right? Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:01 PM ET \nYes, although saying they’re not a priority for deportation is not the same as affirmatively shielding them from it, so it’s still an open question whether he will narrow or remove that protection, and what if anything Trump would do to replace it. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:03 PM ET \nYes, for sure. But it’s interesting that the philosophy undergirding it — that it’s not a wholesale sweep but targeted mainly on those who have criminal issues — is similar. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:04 PM ET \nThe Sean Spicer we are seeing here is a completely different person from the irate, reading-from-a-script, unwilling-to-take-questions person who appeared in the briefing room on Saturday night. He started out seeming a bit nervous, but seems to have relaxed into this. But nobody has directly challenged him yet either. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:06 PM ET \nJulie, that is absolutely true. I’m a little surprised that there haven’t been questions about Michael Flynn and the debacle of Saturday. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:06 PM ET \nAnd Julie, to your observation about what they’re saying on DACA, they seem to be channeling pretty clearly that they don’t have a clear plan yet. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:06 PM ET \nSpicer refers questions on joint U.S.-Russian action in Syria to the Pentagon, but in general says if there’s a chance to work together, “Sure, we’ll take it.” Maggie Haberman \nPeter, he certainly bounced off that rather fraught statement quickly. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 2:08 PM ET \nA reminder: The Trans-Pacific Partnership originated under George W. Bush, when Spicer worked at the trade representative’s office. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:09 PM ET \nJon Karl welcomes him to the job and then drops the hammer: “Will you always tell the truth?” Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:09 PM ET \nSpicer says, “It is.” This doesn’t quite get to how he didn’t do that on Saturday. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:10 PM ET \nJust one more thought on Spicer’s initial joke about Josh Earnest’s position as most popular press secretary being safe: It is a softer-edged way of making the argument he and the Trump team have been for months, that the press loved Obama and was never willing to give them a fair shake. By calling attention to Earnest’s good rapport with the media, he is driving that home while seeming to brush off the sour start. Maggie Haberman \nHe literally said sometimes we can disagree with the facts. Maggie Haberman \n“It was the most-watched inaugural,” Spicer says. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:12 PM ET \nIn his discourse on honesty as press secretary, Spicer just said, “Sometimes we can disagree with the facts.” \nThat sounds remarkably like Kellyanne Conway’s statement on Sunday that he was offering “alternative facts.” And now he is defending the false statements, saying he was given inaccurate information on Metro ridership from the Presidential Inaugural Committee, and when he talked about the largest audience ever, he was also counting internet streams that are unquantifiable. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 2:12 PM ET \nJon Karl is an appropriate person to kick off this phase of the briefing. He was combative with Jay Carney after Benghazi. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:13 PM ET \nThe alternative fact that Spicer appears to be trying to hold to is that Trump’s inauguration viewership was biggest, “period.” Maggie Haberman \nThis is going a bit downhill. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:14 PM ET \n“Where was the apology to the president of the United States?” Spicer asks of Zeke Miller’s mistake (an honest one that he apologized for) about the Martin Luther King Jr. bust being moved from the Oval Office. Maggie Haberman \nThis is ultimately what this is about, guys. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:14 PM ET \nAnd if someone is watching this on television, I imagine that their sympathies lie with Spicer, not the press. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:15 PM ET \nThe White House has made the mistake about the bust, quickly corrected, far more prominent than it ever was originally. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:15 PM ET \n“Over and over again, there is this attempt to go after this president,” Spicer says. “There’s a rush to judgement every time.” He is back to talking about the King bust flap. This is the White House putting journalists on notice to watch what they report. Maggie Haberman \nThis is Spicer channeling Trump pretty purely. Trump genuinely believes he’s been treated unfairly. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:20 PM ET \nI’d like to make the point, by the way, as we await the visit by the British Prime Minister Theresa May later this week, that Trump has been politically wise to make trade his kickoff issue. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:20 PM ET \nIt was the heart of the concern for most of his voters. And meeting with unions is part of an effort he’s made since the spring to draw Bernie Sanders supporters from the left into his populist coalition. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:22 PM ET \nIt also reinforces Trump’s status as a more independent president, going against longstanding Republican orthodoxy from the start. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:22 PM ET \nSpicer’s background at the trade representative’s office is useful for arguing trade issues, which are arcane. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:24 PM ET \nAnd Peter, on making this bust mistake prominent, it really is a reminder of how asymmetrical covering this administration will be. Any mistake by the press, no matter how quickly it’s addressed, will be amplified to Trump’s supporters, even as the press secretary makes untrue statements. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:25 PM ET \nGood thing Spicer used to be the spokesman for the Budget Committee. He is practiced at answering detailed questions about the economy and fiscal policy, like the one about unemployment numbers he just fielded. Glenn Thrush White House Correspondent 2:25 PM ET \nSpicer seems both more broadly conversant with policy than most press secretaries and more willing to freely discuss policy than other flacks. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:25 PM ET \nNever a bad thing politically to make the media the enemy. That’s one area where Americans can agree. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:25 PM ET \nYes, he seems to be pretty fluent in aspects of policy, and able to think on his feet. Peter Baker \nNone of which is actually making news, however. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:26 PM ET \nAnd yes, Peter, this is the challenge. We are equal-opportunity offenders in the minds of voters. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:28 PM ET \nSeeing this version of Spicer is a reminder, if I may, of how most people tend to change the closer they get to the ring of power in Trump’s orbit. This was a constant throughout the 2016 campaign. Glenn Thrush White House Correspondent 2:28 PM ET \nWhat a difference between Sean today vs. Saturday — Dr. Banner vs. the Hulk — staff-prep vs. Donald prep. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:29 PM ET \nOn the other hand, Spicer didn’t really answer the question of what metric this White House will use to measure the unemployment rate. Trump routinely said during the campaign that the rate could be as high as 40 percent (it was 4.7 percent in December and around there for most of 2016). Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:29 PM ET \nNo, he did not. He completely deflected it. But that kind of elision from one thought to another, without answering the question, is not endemic to him! Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:30 PM ET \nThe argument, of course, being whether people who aren’t counted in the 4.7 percent — people who have stopped looking, people who hold down two part-time jobs but want one full-time job, etc. — should be counted, too. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:33 PM ET \nSpicer is now asked whether the president has spoken to the intelligence agencies about the investigation into potential Russian contacts during the campaign and after by his advisers. He said he didn’t believe they had spoken. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:33 PM ET \nAlso says he has made no indication that he would stop an ongoing investigation, but that’s not exactly the same as saying he won’t stop one. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:35 PM ET \nPretty quick brush-off of the question of whether when Trump says he’ll work with anyone to defeat ISIS, he is including President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Spicer said let’s not take it too far, but doesn’t give a flat “no.” Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:36 PM ET \nThis is the way this White House will work: “We’re done with executive orders for today — but as I say, stand by.” Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:36 PM ET \nYes. And leaving options open for almost everything, while then appearing to close them off when they aren’t. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:38 PM ET \nSpicer came back to the briefing room on Friday just a couple of hours after Trump was inaugurated and basically said, for the next eight years, stand by. Essentially telling the press corps they can expect little of the usual concrete guidance on logistics and planning that they have traditionally relied on to cover the White House. It’s a new day. Maggie Haberman \nOur colleague Michael Shear is now getting a question. Peter Baker \nI actually gave Spicer credit for conceding the obvious out of the gate. Maggie Haberman \nIn terms of how much spur-of-moment Trump has always done and will do. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 2:39 PM ET \nSpicer reiterated a tough line on the South China Sea, saying the U.S. will defend areas that are in international waters. But he didn’t repeat Rex Tillerson’s comment during his confirmation hearing about denying China access to islands. China’s argument is that these islands are in Chinese waters. Maggie Haberman \nI wonder how what Spicer said about China will be received there. Maggie Haberman \nThe news on ending DACA is quite something. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:41 PM ET \nHe’s taking a number of questions from foreign reporters, which White House press secretaries don’t always do. Foreign reporters in Washington are usually given the back of the hand; more willingness to engage by the White House would go a long way to building good will. Mark Landler \nSpicer underlines how Trump views China almost purely through an economic/trade prism. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:42 PM ET \nMaggie, that concession about Trump’s unpredictability is important for Spicer’s own credibility. He’s setting expectations low on whether he will be able to accurately forecast what his boss is going to do. Which is quite a position to be in as the White House press secretary. Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 2:42 PM ET \nI tried to pin Sean down on what Trump thinks about legislation on immigration, and in particular the Dreamers. It seems clear that they are not going to end the DACA program right away, but not clear what they will do in the long run. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:43 PM ET \nAbsolutely true, Julie. I’d also argue that Sean needs to earn credibility back after Saturday’s mess. Today is a step, but it will take awhile. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:43 PM ET \nThat said, Spicer has one of the hardest jobs in Washington traditionally, and all the more so under a president like Trump. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 2:45 PM ET \nSpicer is right that General Flynn has met with lots of counterparts in his National Security Council prep. Obama folks complained that he met with too many foreign officials, not enough with their staff. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:45 PM ET \nSpicer seems to be conceding a non-alternative fact, that Trump did not have the biggest in-person inaugural crowd. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:46 PM ET \nThis is extraordinary. Spicer, who literally put up pictures of the crowd size on the National Mall as he talked on Saturday about how this was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, is saying he actually meant total audience including on TV and online. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:46 PM ET \nAnd explained in grassy-knoll-level detail how many factors colluded against Trump that he claimed the media was unfairly characterizing. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:49 PM ET \nThis is a good example of why you take questions. If reporters had gotten a chance to ask, they could have pinned Spicer down on Saturday about precisely what he meant on the inaugural crowd size. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:51 PM ET \nSpicer is dissembling about what Trump has said about about the intelligence community. Trump compared them to Nazis . Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:52 PM ET \nIn denying what we have all heard and seen with our own ears and eyes about the degree to which Trump has publicly disparaged the intelligence community, Spicer is back to what Trump perceives as a vendetta against him in the media. “There is this constant theme to undercut the enormous support that he has.” Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:52 PM ET \nSpicer is now taking on the entire American tradition of second-guessing and speculation. Discussing whether it makes sense for a candidate to go to Michigan is not really delegitimization. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:52 PM ET \nThe kind of things that he describes are pretty typical of any White House. When he says he’s never seen anything like this, it’s because he’s never been the White House press secretary before. My guess is his predecessors felt the same. Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 2:53 PM ET \nIt’s really remarkable how Spicer is acknowledging what we all know — that Trump and his top people are obsessed by the coverage and the sometimes negative reaction to what he says and does. Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 2:54 PM ET \nAs Peter says, much of this is the normal back and forth. But normally presidents and their aides litigate the coverage behind closed doors, yelling at reporters but not taking the fight public. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:55 PM ET \nNo question it must be “demoralizing” for people in the White House to wake up and read all the media, but that’s hardly new or unique to this president or White House, not even close. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:56 PM ET \nSpicer says “it’s a little demoralizing” to see the coverage Trump has received since being inaugurated and argues that “the default narrative is always negative.” The White House press corps is skeptical of every president and challenges assertions all the time. It seems he is suggesting that the media is responsible for bucking them up and providing coverage they consider “positive.” Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:56 PM ET \nThis recalls the old saying: The media doesn’t report on the planes that land safely every day.
