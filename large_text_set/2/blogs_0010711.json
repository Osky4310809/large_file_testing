They have assumed responsibility of the team and their interest in football and Inter can be seen. \n\"They know where to take the club. You can see that they want Inter to be back among the biggest clubs in the world and they are on the right track. \n\"Top players are already there, although in the future, as a fan, I can always hope for the best players. \n\"Stefano Pioli has overseen a big change in recent weeks. He is doing an extraordinary job and proving to be very capable. \n\"Do I miss our champions of the past? There are many players that remain in my heart, but Inter are a top team again. There are no regrets but only hopes for the future.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:06:03.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
