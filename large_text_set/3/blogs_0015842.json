It was originally published on March 27, 2013. Enjoy! \nThere’s really no such thing as a weed in nature. As Dwight D. Ligenfelter of the Department of Agronomy at Penn State University points out, weeds are simply plants “whose undesirable qualities outweigh their good points” in the eyes of human beings. \nIndeed, it is our human activities — farming, gardening, creating golf courses and parks — that create “weed problems.” \nWe tend to think of weeds as pests — plants that grow where they are unwanted. As weeds produce an abundant amount of seeds — which can survive for long periods of time in a dormant state – they are, says Ligenfelter, “naturally strong competitors” for the “water, light, soil nutrients and space” needed by the plants that humans want to grow. \nWeeds certainly have their drawbacks: they can be hosts for crop diseases, provide shelter for insects and produce substances toxic to plants, animals and humans — think about poison ivy. Not surprisingly, humans spend billions of dollars annually to control and eradicate weeds. \nAs Ligenfelter notes, however, weeds — which of course aren’t trying to push out human-planted crops — have numerous benefits, from stabilizing the soil to providing habitat and food for wildlife, as milkweed does for monarch butterflies . \nThese are some good weeds that can be welcomed in a yard rather than viewed as the archenemy: 1. Pennycress Photo Credit: benet2006/Flickr \nHelen Atthowe of Vegan Permaculture observed that pennycress , a common roadside plant, did not compete with her crops and, indeed,, attracted beneficial insects. She started to allow pennycress to spread, hoping that it would prevent other weeds more likely to compete with her crops from doing the same. Rather than eradicating weeds, “ editing ” them can be beneficial. \nPennycress has other potential uses, as well. Researchers are investigating whether field pennycress might be a source of biofuel , as its seeds contain an oil that has uses in producing biodiesel. 2. Lamb’s Quarters Photo Credit: Forest and Kim Starr/Flickr \nLamb’s quarters are just one type of weed — another is goldenrod — that protect your plants by luring away insects that can cause damage. Lamb’s quarters can also be eaten — though be careful, lest they’ve been planted in contaminated soil — and can provide up to twice as much nutrition as spinach or Swiss chard. \nAs one urban forager notes , they’re not so tasty raw. Bu t sauté the m with a little olive oil, and you’ll wonder why the plant is even called a weed! 3. Clover Photo Credit: Paul Williams/Flickr \nWhile many seek to uproot it from lawns, clover actually used to be included in grass seed mixes, as it helps to fertilize the soil. A legume , clover fixes nitrogen and adds it to the soil. \nClover also attracts earthworms and can lure rabbits away from eating your grass and other crops. Clover helps to retain more moisture than it consumes, acting as a sort of “green mulch” or “ green manure ” for surrounding plants. 4. Dandelion Photo Credit: Sarah/Flickr \nThis weed may irk those who want their lawn to look like a carpet, but it has numerous uses . Dandelions have strong tap roots that extend far under the ground, breaking up hard soil and bringing up nutrients that plants with shorter roots can’ \nDandelion leaves are edible — Photo Credit: \nMugwort – also known as “felon’s weed — grows in lawns, waste places, golf fairways, shores, roadsides and along railroad tracks. As it is resistant to mowing and has ” strong and persistent rhizomes ,” \nPeter Del Tredici, a senior research scientist at Harvard University’s Arnold Arboretum, calls mugwort the “quintessential urban weed.” \nAs Ralph Waldo Emerson said, a weed is a plant whose virtues have not been discovered. Indeed, we might even say, in the words of Del Tredici , that “weed” is a “politically incorrect term” and an unfair “value judgment”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T03:03:09.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
