A U.S. international with 124 caps to his name, Beasley is the only American to have played in four separate World Cup tournaments. He most recently appeared for the United States in a 1-0 win over Jamaica last week. \n“I feel that DaMarcus is the best left back in the country, and he not only has experience but also has a great level of talent,” Houston head coach Wilmer Cabrera said. \"He can continue to bring that level to the team and to his teammates, and he’s motivated to do that. We’re really excited to have him back, and hopefully he starts to have an impact on the field and off of it right away.” \nHouston kicks off its MLS campaign on March 4 at BBVA Compass Stadium against the Seattle Sounders.
