Alexis Bledel’s Rory confessed to Lauren Graham’s Lorelai that she’s pregnant. Nobody knows who the father is (it’s totally Logan), and it seemed like a really awkward place to end the show in the event Netflix decided not to pick it up for a second season. There’s a good chance we’ll find out who the dad is, as well as see more of Luke’s weird hairline and that pig that Kirk has for some reason .\nNetflix’s COO Ted Sarandos recently told UK’s Press Association (via Deadline ) that they’ve started having talks with Gilmore Girls creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino about another season. The first season of GG: A Year in the Life was considered a success; the first episode got 5.99 million viewers in the first three days of streaming.\nIt sounds like a second season wouldn’t be a total waste of time. Except that Vanity Fair points out there’s a lot of people involved with Gilmore Girls that might be too busy to commit to more episodes. Lauren Graham is starring in a pilot for Fox called Linda from HR and has a recurring role on the upcoming season of Curb Your Enthusiasm . Milo Ventimiglia is busy with This Is Us . Amy Sherman-Palladino has a new show premiering this month on Amazon called The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel . And we all know how full Chad Michael Murray’s schedule is.\nThe obvious solution here is to just write the whole second season around Kelly Bishop . One, because DUH. But two, because I’m sure everyone would watch a whole year’s worth of Emily Gilmore volunteering at the whaling museum.\nOne ticket to the Nantucket Whaling Museum please. pic.twitter.com/V4sH7WeqYt \n— Gilmore Girls (@GilmoreGirls) December 30, 2016 \n\nPics: Splash , Vanity Fair", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T10:13:28.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
