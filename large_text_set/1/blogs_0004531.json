Comments \nPhoto Credit: www.facebook.com/CongressionalBlackCaucus \nThe vast majority of congressional Democrats don’t want to take a final stand against Donald Trump’s election, even if it is a symbolic move telling Americans why they believe his presidency is illegitimate during Friday’s ratification of the 2016 Electoral College vote.Despite GOP-led voter suppression that civil rights activists say deterred millions of Black and Brown voters, despite Russian actions that helped Trump and hurt Democrats, and despite a new report that 50 or more of Trump’s presidential electors were illegally seated—amounting to vote fraud by a party that bludgeons Democrats on that very issue—grassroots activists said they could not find one senator on Thursday willing to commit to signing a formal Electoral College challenge.The activists said several House members were willing to sponsor a formal challenge—as Rep. Stephanie Tubbs-Jones, D-OH, did in 2005, then opposing ratification of Ohio’s 2004 Electoral College votes. But they could not find a senator, like Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-CA., who in 2005 led that body's challenge. If one House member sponsored the objection, and a second House member and one senator signed on, the joint session of Congress convened to ratify the results would adjourn and the House and Senate would hold a two-hour debate.That’s what happened in 2005. Tubbs-Jones and Boxer lectured their colleagues on GOP voter suppression efforts in Ohio and other partisan efforts targeting presumed Democrats and their ballots. It didn’t stop President George W. Bush’s re-election, but it made a symbolic point that Democrats were willing fight for voting rights. Boxer said she did it because she was disgusted with happened in Florida in 2000—when the Supreme Court stopped a recount and awarded the presidency to Bush.Notwithstanding any last minute changes of heart or courageous impulses, it’s not likely Democrats will make a parallel high-profile stance protesting Trump’s election. Skeptics will say, ‘what is the point if it changes nothing?’ But that is not how the activists pushing for an Electoral College challenge see it.Ruby Sales, who as a teenager active in the 1960s civil rights movement in Alabama was nearly assassinated by a county deputy—a white minister was killed instead—has been lobbying the Congressional Black Caucus to seize the moment to tell Americans that they will stand up for voting rights. Ryan Clayton, part of the Hamilton Electors movement that urged Republican Electoral College members to pick a more fit president, was promoting the research that 50-plus Trump electors were illegally seated—underscoring GOP hypocrisy on policing voters. And even as the country is still learning about Russian hacking, Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-CO, issued a statement Thursday saying he would address foreign interference in elections. But as Ann Massaro, co-founder of Women and Allies and part of the coalition seeking to a challenge on voter suppression grounds, said, the push for telling the nation why Trump has an illegitimate presidency is not coming from elected Democrats.“All of this is happening as a result of a grassroots movement of people, of grassroots movements, on the phones, and letters,” she said. “We hand delivered letters to members of Congress who were most likely, because of their voting record, to stand up and do this—Democrats… There is going to be a very large grassroots movement growing in this country—like we haven’t seen since the war in Vietnam or the Civil Rights Movement.”As Clayton said earlier this week, you can be sure the Republicans would be screaming constitutional bloody murder if the opposite were happening—Congress was convening joint session to ratify Hillary Clinton’s election after 50 Democratic electors were found ineligible to cast the Electoral College votes making her president. The arguments, information and analyses that he, Massaro, Sales and others are citing are not being embraced by Democrats at large or by Republicans of conscience.Just as the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign did not lead the recount in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the party’s congressional leaders are showing that they are not prepared or willing to take on Trump and the GOP with the urgency that grassroots progressives say is required.We will see what unfolds on Friday afternoon—after many in Congress spend the morning hearing more intelligence agency testimony on Russian actions. Perhaps one senator will step forward and join with House members to protest Trump’s election.The press secretary of the one Democratic senator that many grassroots activists were pinning their hopes on, New Jersey’s Cory Booker, did not respond to an e-mail inquiry seeking his position. At 5 PM EST Thursday, another staffer in Booker’s office said that he had not yet taken a position. \n\nSteven Rosenfeld covers national political issues for AlterNet, including America's democracy and voting rights, campaigns and elections, and many social justice issues.
