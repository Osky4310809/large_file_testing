Picture: Thinkstock \nAccording to The Sun the woman wrote: “I know bodybuilders are supposed to go nuts for it because of how quickly you can bulk on it. \n“Anything else you want to do with it is totally up to you.” \nThe woman added in her ad that “no other services” were being offered and the buyer would not be able to get the milk direct from the source. \nShe continued: “I was thinking twenty bucks per bag (enough for me to buy more bags). \n“And if it’s of any interest, I am good looking, late 20s, big boobs (at the moment anyway).” \nBut, while the milk may have benefits, buying it in this way would also come with a number of risks. media_camera The woman selling her breast milk said bodybuilders “go nuts” for the product (generic image).
