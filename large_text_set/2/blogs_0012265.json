Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro holds an image of the late President Hugo Chavez at a meeting with governors Tuesday in Caracas. Reuters \n\"The procedure is done in light of the content that the mentioned news station has systematically been broadcasting, which presents a clear aggression against the Venezuelan homeland,\" said CONATEL, which also silenced a national TV broadcaster a decade ago . \nThis time, the catalyst was CNN's investigation that allegedly uncovered \"serious irregularities in the issuing of Venezuelan passports and visas, including allegations that passports were given to people with ties to terrorism.\" The accusations came from Misael Lopez, the former legal adviser to the Venezuelan Embassy in Iraq. \nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodríguez said CNN aired fake, manipulated information in its passport investigation. And she alleged that the report's main source was \"a delinquent who tried to steal Venezuela's money.\" \n\"CNNE started a psychological war, an operation of war propaganda, based on falsehoods,\" Rodríguez said. \nAs the CNN decision was coming down in Venezuela, President Donald Trump was meeting at the White House with Lilian Tintori, the wife of imprisoned Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. Trump tweeted asking for the release of Lopez, who has been detained since February 2014 by the government of President Nicolás Maduro.

With a discredited and divided opposition at home, Tintori — a mother of two — has become one of the leading figures opposing Maduro.

Carlos Garcia Rawlins / Reuters \n\"People are going crazy about the blockage, they urgently need an alternative. CNN was a glimmer of hope. It can't be taken from people,\" Gustavo Díaz, head of the website DolarToday , told NBC News. \nThe CNN report pointed to Vice President Tareck El Aissami as one of those responsible. \nThis week he was also in Washington's crosshairs. After accusing El Aissami of drug trafficking, the Trump administration imposed sanctions that block U.S. entities from doing business with him. \nMaduro responded to what he called \"defamation\" by saying the Foreign Ministry would send a \"protest letter\" to the U.S. business attaché in Venezuela demanding a retraction. \nThe U.S. sanctions against El Aissami and his right-hand man, businessman Samark Lopez, target 13 companies, including five in the United States. Properties in Miami were worth tens of millions of dollars. \nEl Aissami responded via Twitter, saying: \n\"Personally, I view this dreadful and miserable aggression as a recognition of my condition as an anti-imperialist revolutionary…WE WILL BE VICTORIOUS\" En lo personal recibo esta miserable e infame agresión como un reconocimiento a mi condición de revolucionario antiimperialista!!VENCEREMOS — Tareck El Aissami (@TareckPSUV) February 14, 2017 \n\"They won't be able to handle our unwavering resolution to be FREE. Long live Chavez,\" he also tweeted, referring to Hugo Chavez, the revolutionary leader who founded the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and died of cancer in 2013. No podrán con nuestra resolución inquebrantable de ser LIBRES para siempre!! Viva CHÁVEZ!! Viva la REVOLUCIÓN BOLIVARIANA!! VENCEREMOS!! — Tareck El Aissami (@TareckPSUV) February 14, 2017 \nMaduro's government is under increased pressure because of a crumbling economy, one of the highest inflation rates in the world and a nationwide shortage of food and medicine.
