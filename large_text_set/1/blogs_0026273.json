That directive has also spurred nationwide protests and lawsuits in several states, in addition to condemnations in many foreign capitals. \nThe reaction has been especially strong from the U.S. technology industry , which counts on foreign workers to fill positions that don’t have enough American applicants with the necessary skills. In a memo to employees , Apple ( AAPL ) Chief Executive Tim Cook said he shared their concerns about Mr. Trump’s actions and promised the company would do all it can to help employees affected by the action. \n“It is not a policy we support,” wrote Cook, who’s a member of Mr. Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. “Apple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship.” President Trump took to Twitter to defend his controversial executive order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the... \nCook didn’t specify how many employees are affected. A spokesperson for the Cupertino, California, company couldn’t immediately be reached. \nAbout 200 employees of Alphabet’s Google ( GOOG ) business are affected by the move, according to the search engine giant. Co-founder Sergey Brin, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union, reportedly joined protestors denouncing the move at the San Francisco International Airport. Google also formed an immigration crisis fund that could raise as much as $4 million for groups that are helping immigrants, such as the American Civil Liberties Union. \nAbout 76 Microsoft ( MSFT ) workers were affected as were three IBM ( IBM ) employees according to the companies, which both raised concerns about the new policies. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, himself an immigrant from India, told the software giant’s employees that he has experienced the benefits of immigration, a point he has made in private meetings with government leaders .
