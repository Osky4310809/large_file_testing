If that’s the case, it makes more sense for Owens to drop the title prior to WrestleMania 33 — but it might say something about how the WWE Universe views the red brand’s belt versus John Cena’s WWE Championship belt on SmackDown LIVE . Will Brock Lesnar leave WrestleMania 33 as the Universal Champion? [Image by WWE] \nInevitably, the team of Jeri-KO will have to split, ending in a marquee match between Kevin Owens and Chris Jericho. Rather than having Owens drop the title to Goldberg at Fast Lane , wouldn’t it make more sense for Lesnar to prevent Goldberg from winning the title at Fast Lane — with Goldberg returning the favor a week later at MSG — setting up a champion vs. champion match between Kevin Owens and United States Champion Chris Jericho? Then, WrestleMania 33 could have four main event-level matches that include: Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg Kevin Owens vs. Chris Jericho — Universal Championship & United States Championship Match John Cena vs. Randy Orton vs. AJ Styles — WWE Championship Triple Threat Match The Undertaker vs. Roman Reigns \nOn top of that, there is the rumored Big Show vs. Shaquille O’Neal match, and the definite possibility that Triple H will return the ring. Charlotte Flair will likely be putting her PPV championship defense streak on the line, and names like Finn Balor, Shane McMahon and even Kurt Angle aren’t out of the question. \nGoldberg vs. Lesnar doesn’t need the Universal Championship for the match to be worthy of a WrestleMania main event. Leaving the title around the waist of Kevin Owens would make his match at WrestleMania 33 one of the main events. However, if the WWE is trying to show their fans that the Universal Championship is as good as, if not better than, the WWE Championship, then perhaps the smart move is to have Goldberg and Lesnar fight over it in the final match at this year’s biggest event.
