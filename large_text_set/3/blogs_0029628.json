News exclusively, \"My Hollywood dream was to move to Los Angeles, live openly as a gay man and own my own business. For more than 25 years, I've lived that dream by making The Abbey a place where everyone is welcome and has an opportunity to follow their dreams. Every night at The Abbey is a different adventure. There are people visiting a gay bar for the first time, celebrities cutting loose, the staff hustling to fulfill their Hollywood dream, and all kinds of people looking for love, whether, gay, straight, lesbian or still figuring it out. There is something at The Abbey for everyone.\" \nCooley continues, \" What Happens at The Abbey is an action-packed sneak-peak into what it is really like to work at The Abbey. You'll see celebrities, love, heartbreak, comedy, and a whole lot of partying. I wanted to make this show with E! because E! loves Hollywood success stories. The team at E! is pulling back the curtain on one of the most popular nightclubs in Los Angeles and is showing the world that making your way in Hollywood is filled with glamour, fun, success, setbacks and drama. E! knows sexuality is a fluid concept and has done a great job capturing the complicated nature of modern romance. Each cast member has a unique story that grows out of their experience from The Abbey.\" \nTake a look at the gallery to meet the cast of the new E! series and watch the supertease above to preview all of the drama ahead this season!
