The Steelers don’t prepare that well defensively. They just throw the same scheme out there from 2001 and hope it works. Jan 24, 2017 10:27 AM \nBottom line is Pittsburgh played zone……….Brady was salivating at zone look alan226 says: Jan 24, 2017 10:27 AM \nRead between the lines. Tomlin and Dupree basically just said they weren’t prepared as well as the Patriots and were out coached and couldn’t adjust. Maybe Bradshaw was right. \nTime for some new coaches in Steeler country….. latrobe21 says: Jan 24, 2017 10:28 AM \nTerry was right about Tomlin. patriottony says: Jan 24, 2017 10:29 AM \nB H ,,,,who is the A**HOLE NOW TOMLIN??? WHO? abrasion says: Jan 24, 2017 10:30 AM \nTomlin might be a good cheerleader/motivator but his game-planning and in-game adjustments are terrible. Pittsburgh would have at least one or two more Super Bowl wins over the last decade if they had a better coach. mrkbuilders says: Jan 24, 2017 10:33 AM \nI wonder why? In head to head games, they have an excellent record against you and they always put up points. \nThey came into the game with the best record in the league this season, Brady was 2nd in passer rating to Ryan and he has a monster sized chip on his shoulder. \nIf you were surprised by their offense, you clearly didn’t do your homework this week….. Jan 24, 2017 10:34 AM \nCheerleader. mataug says: Jan 24, 2017 10:37 AM \nall about the current matchup on that Sunday, cannot believe how many times Belichick emphasizes this to the media and none of the other 31 head coaches seem to pay attention to it… fundamentals >>>> offensive/defensive philosophy givetheballtoantowainsmithletsgo says: Jan 24, 2017 10:41 AM \nTomlin is terrible, there is no way that team should be struggling to make the playoffs every year. How they could watch the Houston game and then come out with that soft zone D is beyond me. stillworker says: Jan 24, 2017 10:42 AM \nDefensively and offensively, ‘the inability to adjust quickly on the fly’ is the hallmark of the Steelers. It has been since Cowher. factschecker says: Jan 24, 2017 10:42 AM \nMy favorite “got out coached” moment was when Pitt had the ball first and goal 1 foot (not 1 yard but 1 foot) spot. \nAfter the whole “worst call in Super Bowl history” hot take everyone in the world knew it was going to be a run. Including the Patriots. The result was a loss of a yard. Now comes second down. The down that was publicly mocked. I knew Tomlin didn’t have the sack to pass like Seattle did so everyone (Including the Pats) knew this was also going to be a run. And a run it was and the result was a loss of 3 more yards. Jim Brown himself wouldn’t have gotten in on either of those carries. \nThe public debate helped NE in that situation. Then on 3rd down instead of risking anything that could be Malcom Butler’ed they pass to the flat 4 yards shy of the enbdzone. \nThat was the ball game IMO. Tail tucked up between their legs. Not prepared for the moment. To me that falls back on the coaching staff and team captains. firegoodellnow says: Jan 24, 2017 10:43 AM \nI’ve said it for years now. Horrible record against sub .500 teams. Horrible special teams play. Seriously flawed game & clock management. Tomlin gets that “deer in the headlights” look during games and we go down in flames. Steeler fans, you will never see another SB ring with Tomlin at the helm. It’s just the way it is. Too bad, because we are literally wasting Ben’s prime years. Once he retires, we won’t see the SB for a LONG time. The fish rots from the head down. It starts with bad ownership and goes south from there. Admit you made a mistake and can Tomlin before it’s too late. patfanken says: Jan 24, 2017 10:43 AM \nThere WILL come a time when fans start to realize that there is never a huge talent gap between NFL teams, especially the good ones. There could even be a case made that the Steelers have more INDIVIDUAL talent than the Pats. Compare WR’s, OL, DL, LB’s lRB’s In all those groups the Steelers had more of the “big names. \nFootball is a game where the sum CAN be better than the inidividual parts because COACHING is such a critical part of the game. There wasn’t a talent gap in that gap in that game, but there WAS a coaching gap, and a big one. \nEventualy even the haters are going to come to realize that the secret to the Pats consistent long term success is not cheating, but the fact that most of the time they are better prepared, with better game plans, are more unselfish than their opponents. \nThey win because they work a bit harder and are better coached. Everyone who makes it to an NFL team is a great athlete. The lucky ones get to teams where they are coached well. \nBTW- I don’t think Tomlin is a “bad” coach, but just not one on BB’s level. He’s a great checker player, but BB is playing elite level chess footballboozer says: Jan 24, 2017 10:44 AM \nYa know, this is really the first time that i’m thinking Triplin has lost the locker room. cheapseater says: Jan 24, 2017 10:45 AM \nWhy is Belichick the only coach that switches it up depending on the opponent? It’s no wonder they are in their 7th Super Bowl. He’s unreal. Jan 24, 2017 10:46 AM \nWow, MF seems pretty upset about his favorite team’s poor performance. \nBut the Pats do this to everybody. Why blame Tomlin? blah773 says: Jan 24, 2017 10:47 AM \nthey were clearly surprised. but worse than that, they made no in-game adjustments. of any sort. on either side of the ball. and that’s coaching. thelastwordyaheard says: Jan 24, 2017 10:47 AM \nIt must’ve been that one day head start that those A-holes had, right? Memo to Tomlin: Belichick is so many moves ahead of you, you could’ve had an extra year of preparation and it wouldn’t have mattered.. Jan 24, 2017 10:49 AM \ntwo, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate… pastabelly says: Jan 24, 2017 10:49 AM \nBasically, he just called out coaching for lack of preparation. He’s probably right, but the Steelers have bad match up problems on the defensive side and it was pretty much a given that for the Steelers to win, they would have a great day on offense. ths17 says: Jan 24, 2017 10:49 AM \nSERIOUSLY?!? Maybe it’s time for the Steelers to stop ignoring the media. One hour of listening to sports talk radio last week would have prepared you better than your coaches did. micronin127 says: Jan 24, 2017 10:52 AM \nZone defense isn’t necessarily a problem. Seattle plays zone nearly every play and they gave us fits. \nThe key is that you must be able to generate pressure with your 4 down linemen so that you can make the windows really tight. \nPittsburgh checked out to a 2-deep zone and the seams were wide open for Hogan. \nSeattle plays a lot of single high safety and floods the short zones underneath. Forced Brady to hold the ball because the quick out and screens weren’t there and then the pressure got to him. logast says: Jan 24, 2017 10:54 AM \nWhen a player admits the team was ill prepared and outcoached, there is legitimately a problem. There is not an excuse for that in today’s NFL. realdealsteel says: Jan 24, 2017 10:55 AM \nTomlin has proven time and time again that he is not a good coach when coaching against the higher level coaches. \nLook at his record against Bellichek the last 5 games he coached against him; look at his record against John Harbaugh (coach of the Ravens) the last 5 games. \nTomlin won Super Bowls with Cowher players; but the only Cowher players left is Ben. The team is undisciplined and the players really don’t respect him or they wouldn’t be taking games off or video taping locker room meetings. \nIt’s a shame that the Rooney’s are still stuck in a time warp where they don’t fire a coach who is clearly not at a championship level. Just wasting the final years of Big Ben. fsstnotch says: Jan 24, 2017 10:56 AM \nIt was surprising that a 2-3 man rush sloppy zone would get you beat by Brady?! If this is true, every coach in that locker room needs fired because it surprised nobody else! realpatsfan says: Jan 24, 2017 10:56 AM \nI watched a lot of replays and Steelers defenders had no idea what to do when TB changed plays. Steelers offense was in panic mode from the start. I wonder if Steelers will be penalized for not letting the league know about Bells injury? kevpft says: Jan 24, 2017 10:57 AM \nHas this Pittsburgh team ever out-coached, out-strategized anyone? \nReally talented roster, only seems to live up to its potential when all the skill players are there together, comes up small in big games, inconsistent on the road. \nThat sounds like a group of guys overachieving and counting on their top guys to win a footrace rather than a unit with a plan. \nJust as Manning should have had more rings with the Colts than the poor surrounding cast and timid coaching allowed, Ben & co. should have had more for similar reasons. \nIn such a QB-focused sport, how can a team with Roethlisberger not have been to the SB in 8 years and counting? 6ball says: Jan 24, 2017 10:57 AM \n. The no huddle offense has been a staple of the Patriots since Brady took his first NFL snap. It’s one of their strengths. How could it surprise anyone? . robertbonn2013 says: Jan 24, 2017 10:58 AM \nThe definition of insanity is repeating your past errors and expecting different results. Our 3 man rush and zone coverage on Brady borders more on incompetence then insanity, insanity can be dealt with but incompetence in the Steeler higher hierarchy ie Art Rooney is something we will have to live with. Dont ever expect the Steelers to beat New England in a playoff game EVER … Our coaches and owners are incompetent .. mistrezzrachael says: Jan 24, 2017 11:02 AM \nWas so obvious by 1st series that Steelers were not prepared. \nTheir talent level strong…but I question their IQ…No way a safety stays w/Hogan. \nPittsburgh thought that NE would dink them w/running backs vs. linebackers…..NOT….Dion Lewis was a very small part of game plan. \nShame on Steelers….And they didn’t even need to defend Gronk. bencoates57 says: Jan 24, 2017 11:04 AM \nI would have loved to seen the video feed from THAT locker room after the game. truths4all says: Jan 24, 2017 11:07 AM \nYeah, anything and any excuse to avoid giving any credit to a team that executes its game plan better than the other team as well as dominating the other team in the trenches. \nUnsophisticated football fans tend to focus on this failure by one team over another, but the team that controls the line of scrimmage can dictate the flow of the game. \nIf the Steelers dominated the line of scrimmage, no amount of No Huddle by Brady would have worked, pure and simple. After all, that is still Football 101. Jan 24, 2017 11:07 AM \nDoes this shock anyone? Pitt doesn’t draft for IQ. \nDupree is one trick pony and pretty much a bust, who is worthless other than tying to dive into the backfield on every down or rush the passer. \nJarvis Jones is a true bust. \nShazier is overrated as well, but his athleticism masks his low IQ and overrated status as well. \nTypical Baltimore or Pittsburgh or even NY Jets style player. Jan 24, 2017 11:07 AM \nThe entirety of Tomlin’s game plan was “RAH RAH SIS BOOM BAH!” pats777 says: Jan 24, 2017 11:36 AM \nIt was so bad, they gave a 20 yard cushion to a fullback split wide left! Talk about running scared and clueless. steelforce43 says: Jan 24, 2017 11:36 AM \nI am perplexed. New England runs the SAME EXACT offense EVERY SINGLE TIME we play them. How in the world can you be caught off guard? Play man press at the line of scrimmage with safety help over top and blitz up the middle. Houston gave you the game plan. How can I see that and the coaching staff can’t? What am I missing? 700levelvet says: Jan 24, 2017 11:37 AM \nAt this point… Tomlin is a rich man..with nothing to lose…the hood rat persona has been exposed for what it is…but he’s cashed in..Think he really cares? Jan 24, 2017 11:38 AM \nkevpft says: Jan 24, 2017 10:57 AM . \nIn such a QB-focused sport, how can a team with Roethlisberger not have been to the SB in 8 years and counting? - \nFWIW, the Steelers were in SB XLV, so less than 8 years. Since then the AFC QBs have been Brady, three times this year, Manning twice and Flacco once. \nRavens were the only surprise hot team to make the Super Bowl for the AFC in that period. Jan 24, 2017 11:39 AM \nWho would guess the Patriots would use a hurry up ? nhpats says: Jan 24, 2017 11:39 AM \nOf course Dupree was surprised. Did anyone expect Tomlin to actually have his team prepared to take on BB and the Patriots? \nTomlin should not even be allowed to be in the same conversation as BB. navyvandal says: Jan 24, 2017 11:39 AM \nPatriots fans had a good idea, hell NFL fans should have had an one. With our “meh” C- offensive game plan for Houston, you HAD TO EXPECT what was coming. I watched Hogan get wide open because of busted coverage all over the place. Unbelievable. No disrespect to Billy O’Brien, RAC, Vrabel, Izzo, and Vince. They had a beautiful game plan defensively, but Pittsburgh looked like the jets on xmas eve. We had “walk thru’s.” oh what?! Martin says: Jan 24, 2017 11:40 AM \nI don’t think the no-huddle offense was the reason why every completed pass was to a WR with no one at least 5-yards around him. Just look at Hogan’s first TD and Edelman’s TD. I’ve never seen WR so open in the endzone! Jan 24, 2017 11:43 AM \ncheapseater says: Jan 24, 2017 10:45 AM \nWhy is Belichick the only coach that switches it up depending on the opponent? It’s no wonder they are in their 7th Super Bowl. He’s unreal. \nThat is how you win in this era of salary cap. Make your players multi dimensional in terms of style and skill set. Prime example is Bennett and Gronk…they have to be linemen on occasions, and do it well. They have to be quick to line up for huddle or no huddle game (they were snapping ball with 20seconds on game clock). And they were changing pace with the huddle game. As soon as Brady confirmed their protection he audibled, and snapped the ball before Steelers knew what hit them. They are one of the few teams that can morph on the fly, especially after first half (like their last SB win against Seattle – Bennett was killing them, but second half, he was a non issue). Pats play calling is never vanilla like so many teams who go with virtually the same play call after play call hoping things get better, or have a coach (Andy Reid) too engrossed in play sheet to see what is happening on field. Belichek has two superb play callers. He ‘consults’ with them throughout the game. He is watching the game. Pats purposely throw in many wrinkles to see if the other team is smart. Usually they miss something, like Develin all alone…easiest first down he will ever get. Actually, that play summed it up. A guy who runs about as fast as Tom being a wide out. Jan 24, 2017 11:54 AM \nkevpft says: Jan 24, 2017 10:57 \nIn such a QB-focused sport, how can a team with Roethlisberger not have been to the SB in 8 years and counting? \n15 1 Report comment \n– \nProbably because Brady and Manning went to 7 of those 8. Ben is good, really good, but not even in the same conversation as those two. The other guy was Flacco and from what I’ve been told he may be elite. barryblogs says: Jan 24, 2017 11:55 AM \nI am so happy no ones is blaming the fire alarm! mmack66 says: Jan 24, 2017 11:56 AM \ncheapseater says: Jan 24, 2017 10:45 AM \nWhy is Belichick the only coach that switches it up depending on the opponent?

The Patriots can beat you in anyway it requires. \nPittsburgh and most teams for that matter can only win if they can dictate the style of play and play on their terms within their comfort zone. \nChess and checkers. fwippel says: Jan 24, 2017 12:04 PM \nAt some point, you’d think it would dawn upon the Steeler’s coaching staff and players that the game-plan they continue to use to prepare for the Patriots isn’t working. \nIs it wrong to ask this question of the Steelers: How bad do they want it? Jan 24, 2017 12:13 PM \nYep it sounds like he threw the coaches under the bus unintentionally harrisonhits2 says: Jan 24, 2017 12:14 PM \n“The no huddle offense has been a staple of the Patriots since Brady took his first NFL snap. It’s one of their strengths. How could it surprise anyone?” \nNot really in 2001-2006 as much. I think it was 2007 Belichick went to visit Chip Kelly while he was still coaching college and incorporated chunks of his offense into the Pats that they really started using the no huddle as a staple. \nBut since then its as often as not been the normal modus operandi for the Pats offense. \nAnd the Steelers are still running out that tired old Dick LeBeau defense that Belichick and Brady solved years ago. That’s the biggest problem. Especially since the people running it now aren’t as good as LeBeau. patsfan4lifesbchamps says: Jan 24, 2017 12:25 PM \nThey should give Rex Ryan a call.

I’m stumped. mmack66 says: Jan 24, 2017 12:36 PM \nWasn’t it the Steelers, a couple of years ago, that said that they were going to be ready for Gronk, and then they left him completely uncovered? bfindeisen says: Jan 24, 2017 12:38 PM \nmmack66 says: Jan 24, 2017 11:56 AM cheapseater says: Jan 24, 2017 10:45 AM \nWhy is Belichick the only coach that switches it up depending on the opponent?

This man has been in the NFL since the 60’s. He’s been on the coaching staffs of the some of some of the innovators that created the offenses that many teams run. Bill is not only a phenomenal coach and GM, but he’s also an amazing NFL historian. I just saw an interview where he diagrammed an old Navy play from the 50’s or 60’s, just from his head. He was sitting with the RB for that Navy team and the guy was blown away. bfindeisen says: Jan 24, 2017 12:39 PM \nAs a Pats fan, I can tell you that the teams that give the Pats’ offense fits are the ones that employ press-man coverage, while getting pressure with only 4 down lineman. takeyourpunishmentandquitwhininglikeababy says: Jan 24, 2017 12:40 PM \nWhat do the other draft busts have to say?

But, as you go on to say, it’s not entirely about talent, it’s about how well you’re coached, situational football, fundamentals etc… \nWe’ve seen a very serious step back in quality of play in the NFL this year, and I think the problem is more with the recycling of garbage coaches, and the gap between them and the GREAT coaches. It’s very much like the issue with getting a franchise QB. There’s only so many to go around, but when you find him, you latch onto him for as long as you possibly can. walldefender says: Jan 24, 2017 1:29 PM \nNice to see a player say they were out coached rather than the lame standard “filmed practice”“Spygate”“deflategate”“headsetgate” b.s. that most butt-hurt losing players, coaches, and talking heads espouse. If you want to beat the Patriots you have to outwork them and most teams won’t. fishyinalittledishy says: Jan 24, 2017 1:52 PM \nDidn’t watch the game for two reasons. I hate the Patriots and I knew they would rinse the Steelers. But what surprised me about this is that the Steelers were surprised. As a fan of the Dolphins you are never surprised by what they do and as a professional player nor should you have been surprised. Even if you were and I have no reason to think you are telling lies you don’t say you were surprised because in my eyes that makes me think you were not prepared. Still if it’s any consolation it would not have mattered. tedmurph says: Jan 24, 2017 2:02 PM \nThe steelers probably weren’t sweating the Pats. According to Keith Butler, their passing gm is next to nothing without Gronk. According to Butler, a lot of stuff the Pats do is ‘borderline legal’. He was probably busy looking out for that. He sounds like a steeler fan boy. By the way, anyone heard from any of the usual suspects? Don’t worry, if the Pats lose the SBowl, they’ll be back. That will be their big victory. diehardfootballfan says: Jan 24, 2017 2:27 PM \nBottom line: Tomlin’s coaching was downright pee-wee league. He’s really lost control of his team.
