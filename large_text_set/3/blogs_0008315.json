[Video] \nIn the video, Tillerson can be seen shaking hands with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin and posing for photographs. \nMitchell then asks about China’s and Russia’s relationships with Ukraine, but both diplomats refuse to give her an answer.   \n“Are you sure that the Trump administration will be strong against (Russian President) Vladimir Putin? Can you assure us that Russia will not be able to move forward in Ukraine?” Mitchell asks Klimkin. \nShortly thereafter, she’s asked by State Department staffers to leave the area. \n“We haven’t had any time in here,” Mitchell says to the staff. \n“I’m so sorry, but you’re going to have to leave,” one staffer responds.   Gowdy: Evidence So Far Lacking To Support Trump’s Wiretap Claim \nAfter playing a clip of the exchange, Mitchell said the State Department is “taking a back seat on national security and is now facing massive budget cuts.” \n“This afternoon I’ll be at the first State Department briefing, the first in six weeks since the inaugural,” she continued, “an absence of public diplomacy not seen since 1953 when Dwight Eisenhower was president, when this tradition started of speaking out from the platform here at the State Department to the rest of the world.” \nA similar situation required Mitchell to be escorted out of the State Department building last Friday. \nDuring a meeting between Tillerson and International Atomic Energy Agency Director Yukiya Amano, Mitchell asked repeatedly about potential budget cuts to the State Department. \nAfter not receiving an answer, Mitchell was confronted by staffers and asked to leave.
