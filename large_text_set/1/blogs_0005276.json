If you‚Äôve given AirPods a try we want to hear how they fit and if they fall out or stay in your ears. This week we‚Äôve also seen the first app released to help you locate your missing AirPod(s) . \nA new app called ‚ÄòFinder for AirPods‚Äô priced at $3.99 has become the first tool to help you find your missing AirPod(s). As of this writing it has 4.5/5 stars in the app store. The app gives you the ability to locate even individual AirPods with a clean UI. \nBecause the app utilizes the the wireless signature of your AirPods to pin them down, you‚Äôll need to be in decent proximity to them. It seems this app will be most helpful for misplacing your AirPods indoors. \nOut of the mostly positive reviews, users shared success finding AirPods lost in beds and around the house with good accuracy. A couple negative reviews shared experiences of poor accuracy. Your results could vary depending on your environment and potential interference. But for $3.99 compared to a $69 replacement through Apple , this app could be worth a shot. \nOne frustrating way to misplace your AirPods is if they just fall out. While many people are finding them to be a solid fit (myself included) that‚Äôs definitely not everyone‚Äôs experience. Apple‚Äôs AirPods sport a lot of great features and some impressive tech in such a small package. And even though many people who are holding out are doing so because of price , the $159 cost in line with the competition. \nHowever, like Jordan shared today , ‚Äúif they don‚Äôt fit, the rest doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Here at 9to5 we‚Äôve had mixed experiences and it seems it comes down to how close you are to having ‚Äòaverage‚Äô size ears. Here are two examples from Seth and Greg: I won‚Äôt share the slo-mo (embarrassing), but this GIF should be enough. Shaking violently isn‚Äôt enough to get them out of my ears.

My left ear is bigger than my right, so the left usually falls out sooner. I‚Äôve been using EarBuddyz to keep them firmly in place. Even though it‚Äôs an extra step, the comfort, sound improvement, and function has been worth it. \nSpigen also has the AirPods Strap to supposedly prevent the loss of your investment, although I‚Äôm not sure if the weight of strap would create more tug on your AirPods. \nAs Jordan reported after his extensive testing , he named AirPods the top cord-free earphones and the Samsung Gear IconX the runner-up if AirPods don‚Äôt fit or stay in your ears. Whatever experience you‚Äôve had, please share with our poll below!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:14:32.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
