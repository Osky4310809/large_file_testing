However, this year's survey respondents are skeptical,\" the survey, released on Monday evening at the World Economic Forum in Davos , said. \nThe survey by PwC was carried out between September and December 2016 with 1,379 CEOs responding from 79 countries with a range of online, postal, face-to-face and phone interviews. Forty-four percent of respondents said that globalization had \"not at all\" closed the gap between the rich and poor. Just 13 percent agreed that it had helped this inequality \"to a large extent\". The rest implied that it had had some effect. \nPwC contrasts the latest results with its survey from 1998 when CEOs were positive about the drivers of globalization. It also highlighted in the 2017 survey that only 60 percent of CEOs believed that globalization has had a largely positive impact on improving the movement of capital, people, goods and information.

The real challenge here though, isn't just one of how CEOs navigate, it's about the need for CEOs to have a deeper, two-way relationship with stakeholders, customers, employees, and the public,\" Bob Moritz, the global chairman at the company, said in the accompanying press release on Monday. \n\"Understanding the root cause of the potential discontent or perception is a critical first step towards communicating the benefits of business for society. There's a lot at stake if we do not achieve inclusive global growth.\" \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .
