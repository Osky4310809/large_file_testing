Their source says he died of a heart attack, although an autopsy will happen later today. \nQ, who grew up in Queens, New York, started WorldStarHipHop in 2005 as a platform for mixtapes. The site evolved to become a hub for music videos and outrageous clips. WorldStar has been criticized for the graphic nature of its content, but Q explained his vision for the company in a 2015 interview with the New York Times . \n“Hip-hop is for the sex, the drugs, the violence, the beefs, the culture,” he said. “That’s the competitiveness of Hip Hop, so I felt like the site needed to be R-rated.” \nReports of Q’s death come just ahead of the February 3 premiere of Worldstar TV on MTV2. The weekly show will feature comedians and Hip Hop personalities reacting to clips from the site. \nHe leaves behind three children. \nHere are some of the initial reactions from around the Hip Hop community. Wow, RIP World Star Q. As as complicated of a legacy as it gets, but easily one of the most influential hip-hop figures of the millennium. \n— Otto Von Biz Markie (@Passionweiss) January 24, 2017 Rip Q from Worldstar damn I'm mad sad right now god bless the family", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T05:25:48.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
