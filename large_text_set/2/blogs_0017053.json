(Photo: Sherree Lewis-De’Vaughn) \nElijah “E-Jayy” De’Vaughn, a high schooler from Compton, California, is headed to Harvard this fall. And, while Harvard is giving De’Vaughn’s family financial aid, there are still a lot of uncovered costs. \nMoving from southern California to Boston will require good winter clothes. And money for food and textbooks and much more. \nCollege is expensive — even if you get a scholarship. \nAfter getting into Harvard, De’Vaughn said he was worried that it would be too expensive. \n“I don’t want the financial reasons to stop me from getting there,” De’Vaughn told USA TODAY College in an interview. “I’d be lying to you if I said I hadn’t worried about it.” \nThings started looking up when his mom, Sherree Lewis-De’Vaughn, heard about GoFundMe. The family set up a campaign to help raise money for school expenses. To date, they’ve raised over $20,000. \nIf you’re strapped, you have considered crowdfunding like De’Vaughn’s family did to help ease your financial burden and make your college dreams a reality. Thinking of starting a GoFundMe. Nothing wrong, I'm just a broke college student Related: As college costs skyrocket, more students try crowdfunding \nKnowing that many students are intrigued by going this route, GoFundMe just released a guidebook to help college students — or prospective students — set up a campaign to raise money. It includes step-by-step instructions for setting up a campaign and some insider tips (Provide updates! Create a wish list so people can donate to cover specific items!) for how to try to get more donations. \nAccording to GoFundMe CEO Rob Solomon, this is the first step-by-step guidebook for college cost crowdfunding with explicit instructions. The website does have other guides and other help for users. \nSince 2014, GoFundMe users have raised $60 million just for college-related expenses. Across Alabama, 1,506 university students have created tuition campaigns on GoFundMe in last 3 yrs. https://t.co/DeZgODcM3q \nGoing to college isn’t getting any cheaper , so it might be the right time. \n“We started seeing a lot of different education fundraisers on GoFundMe,” Solomon said in an interview. “We thought we would harness our knowledge of it to help out college kids.” \nGoFundMe collects a 5% fee from each donation, and there’s a 2.9% processing fee to donations, too. The fees are subtracted from the campaign total, rather than being tacked on, Solomon said. \nNot everyone is 100% on board with crowdfunding, however. Michelle Singeltary, a Washington Post columnist, once noted that crowdfunding, which makes it “trendy to give,” ignores the root causes of problems and instead funnels money only toward people with compelling narratives. \nSolomon stressed that crowdfunding shouldn’t be used as a replacement for financial aid and scholarships, but as a “complement.” \n“Aid, loans, that’s not where [the costs end],” Solomon said. “Traveling to school is expensive, books are expensive.” \nDe’Vaughn isn’t sure yet what he wants to study at Harvard. He calls himself a writer, but he also likes biology. He’s interested in politics, and when he got on the phone for an interview, he had just gotten out of rehearsal for In the Heights , a musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda of Hamilton fame. \n“I don’t think there’s a concentration that’s writing-microbiology-political science,” De’Vaughn said. \nEven if he’s not sure what he wants to study yet, though, he does know one thing for sure: his life has been changed by the strangers who have donated to his campaign. \n“They’re a life saver,” De’Vaughn said. “They’re life changers.” Cody Boteler is a Towson University student and a USA TODAY College correspondent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:53:32.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
