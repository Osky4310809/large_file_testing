All trains entering and departing Chicago Union Station are presently stopped and delayed. Update will be posted as soon as Amtrak has corrected the problem and trains are on the move,” Metra said in a statement on its website. \nThe computer problems were affecting all trains on the Milwaukee District-North, North Central Service, BNSF, Milwaukee District-West, SouthWest Service and Heritage Corridor lines, according to Metra. \nSeveral Metra riders have shared pictures on social media after they were allowed to exit trains bound for Union Station, so they could find alternate transportation. Here we are @OnTheMetra . Exiting the train. Just told not going any further. Nowhere near Union Station. They do apologize though. #fail pic.twitter.com/VlwdswDZB9 \n— Brett Ward (@tterbdraw) February 24, 2017 #Metra let riders get off at Western.
