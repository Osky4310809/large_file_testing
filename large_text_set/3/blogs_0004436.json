Building a Democratic bench. Want to help? hello@runforsomething.net Mar 7 Why We Run: Levar Stoney Levar Stoney has worked in Democratic politics for more than a decade, including as Executive Director of the Democratic Party of Virginia, and serving as Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia under Governor Terry McAuliffe. In 2016, at age 35, Stoney was elected as the youngest ever mayor of Richmond. He ran a campaign on progressive principles and transparency in government, including an emphasis on education and economic equality. Below, he shares some insights from his experiences campaigning. (Photo credit: Ned Oliver, Richmond Times-Dispatch) I see you worked more behind on the scenes on campaigns early in your career. Was there a particular event or issue that made you want to run yourself, or was that always a goal? As a kid, I always thought I’d get involved in politics, run for office one day. My father passed away at a young age. Before he passed away, he’d always say to me, “You’re gonna run for office one day, right?” and I’d say to him, “You know I’m kind of getting jaded with the whole process.” But after he passed, that was New Year’s Eve of 2011, I kind of redoubled my efforts and it kind of rekindled my interest in running. I think more and more young voices need to be heard in the process. The last few years I’ve been able to work behind the scenes with a lot of elected officials, and I thought it was time for a millennial to jump into the fray. What surprised you most about campaigning as a candidate? How exhausting it was. I’ve been the political director on campaigns and I was always a 24/7 guy. I basically slept with my iPhone on my chest, but that does not compare with how exhausting the job of a candidate is. You have to be on 24/7. You have to be prepared at all times. There’s a discipline you have to have as a candidate that I didn’t have to have as an operative. But you get your sea legs under you. What made me a good director — that I was disciplined and responsive — made me a good candidate. I’m lucky to have had prior experience, because a lot of people don’t start in the same place. What was the best advice about campaigning that you received? The best advice I got was: “Run like you’re 10 points down.” It keeps you on your game, it keeps you sharp. In August, public polling had me at seven percent. I could have given up there. I could have decided to go outside the plan. (That’s a discipline thing.) Instead I stuck to the plan and, on November 8, we won outright. It’s a testament to work ethic and bringing the best version of yourself to work every day. Making calls and knocking on doors is not a sexy thing to do, but it’s necessary and you have to be the best version of yourself in doing so. What do you wish you’d known before you ran? Since I’d run so many campaigns there wasn’t a lot. I will tell you this — I ran one local race in the past. Those sorts of races are different because not only do you have to raise money, but you have to be just as dogged in your outreach to the community at the grassroots level. You have to put just as much time into that as into raising money. What was the most gratifying part of campaigning? What about of governing/serving in office? Well, number one: Winning. Number two: Seeing the surge. That’s when you know your message is reaching the people. In those last three weeks, I just saw us rise and rise and rise. There’s nothing more gratifying than seeing the message you crafted reaching people everywhere, in every neighborhood. They can repeat your message, your story, verbatim back to you without you even asking. The most gratifying part of holding office at this moment has been all the items we spoke about during the campaign — putting some meat on those bones and putting them into action. People want politicians who say what they mean and mean what they say, and that’s what we’re doing. We’re doing everything we said we’d do. We’re not surprising anyone. We said we’d be progressive leaders and that’s what we’re doing. You know, we’re creating meaningful change and that’s gratifying. What is the thing you least expected? We had about 30 different forums and debates. It surprised me that there were that many. You could probably spend more time knocking on doors and reaching people in their homes, but that sort of practice was so helpful. I felt like I got better forum by forum. I got to hone my skill in public speaking. They were all challenging, and I couldn’t take a day off just because I had a forum that night. The media actually covered many of the forums. Which was kind of astounding. In your experience, what do you think makes a strong candidate? Versatility. You have to be versatile. You go into so many different situations. From one minute knocking on doors to the next spending two hours doing call time. Both utilize one’s talent to promote their message, but they’re two different actions. You have to be a candidate for all people. You can’t just be a candidate for certain people, you gotta be a candidate for all people and that’s versatility. That makes a good candidate. And eventually that creates a good leader. I’ve had moments here in this office where I had to go from the scene of a homicide to announcing that we’re bringing in hundreds of jobs to the city, and that takes versatility as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:33:36.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
