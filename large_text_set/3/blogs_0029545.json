But there's another possibility to consider: carrots. Lots and lots of carrots. If Trump ate 16,000 carrots over the last 15 years , it could have been enough to give him that distinct Trump glow. (To the carrot lobby: it’s truly a shame you missed out on your dream spokesperson before he was elected president.) You May Also Like Skin The Best Peel-Off Masks to Try Right Now A little skeptical about Trump’s theoretical fondness for vitamin A? You have every right to be. During the campaign , he was said to be more of a Domino’s, KFC, McDonald’s kind of guy, but just imagine Trump dipping baby carrot after baby carrot into hummus on Air Force One for a moment. “No celery,” he might snarl at an intern nervously offering a colorful crudité platter. “Celery is sad!” It’s about as bizarre and on-brand as he could get. This isn’t the first time that Trump’s tan has been compared to produce. Last Halloween, the world got Trumpkins , A.K.A Trump pumpkins, A.K.A. the ultimate prop for scaring neighborhood children into indefinitely avoiding your porch. But back to the carrots. It may sound like an urban legend, but there’s science to back up our carrot theory. Carrots contain organic pigments call carotenoids that can travel through your bloodstream and make their way to your skin, where they can build up — and then, bam, you’re orange. And here we all were religiously exfoliating and moisturizing when we could have simply eaten carrots for a bioluminescent glow. Of course, it takes a lot of carrots for this phenomenon to occur. “You need to eat consistently high levels of carrots for about four weeks or so for that to happen,” says Joshua Zeichner , the director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. “But in some cases, it can give skin the same kind of yellowish-orange color you’d get from some self-tanners.” (The operative word there being “some” — it goes without saying that these are not the bronzers we’d ever recommend.) And it’s not just carrots that can discolor your skin, according to a study that was recently published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes also contain carotenoids that can turn skin yellowish or orange,” says Zeichner. Just a little something to consider if you ever need to camouflage into Carson Daly’s Orange Room on the Today Show. Until we get our answer, let’s be honest: This may be one of the weirder theories about Trump, but it certainly isn’t the scariest. #", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:53:32.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
