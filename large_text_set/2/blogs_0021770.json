Even the New York Times couldn’t avoid covering it in the Fashion and Beauty section. Beyond flannel clothing and the return of JNCO wide leg jeans , though, musicians like Justin Bieber — who was a newborn baby when Kurt Cobain died — have become notorious for wearing vintage band t-shirts. Despite drawing the ire of many grunge fans, the trend has continued.\nNaturally, “vintage” mall retailer Urban Outfitters has capitalized by selling “retro” graphic tees and hoodies sporting Aaliyah , Tupac, and (surprise!)
