You can talk about anything you want to: movies, music, your deepest desires. Idris is a great listener. He’s also a great talker. He’s pretty much great at everything. I mean, have you seen Luther ?” \nOne caveat: the dinner won’t take place on February 14 precisely, it will be slightly belated, but you will be flown to whatever city Elba happens to be in at the time, with all your airfare and hotel expenses included. And, if you're in a sharing kind of mood, you’ll be allowed to bring along a friend. \nBest of all, all donations will benefit W.E. Can Lead , a nonprofit organization that, according to its mission statement, ensures \"young girls receive the educational opportunity, leadership development, and mentoring support necessary to become the new generation of female leaders who are able to impact every area of society across the continent of Africa.” Which means that everyone who takes part will come out a winner.
