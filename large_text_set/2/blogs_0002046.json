[Photo by Lindsey Thoeng of UN Publications/Provided to chinadaily.com.cn] Over 20 Chinese young people are attending a forum at the United Nations today and Wednesday to discuss with their worldwide counterparts the role of youth in promoting a sustainable future for all. The Chinese representatives are from the UN System in China, the government of China, NGOs, universities and high schools. Among them, six delegates, including Wang Yuan, a member of the well-known band TFboys, Sun Hairuo and Zheng Bozhong, both students at the High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, will participate in the forum on behalf of the UN Country Team in China. They will participate and speak in various discussions related to issues such as health, education, gender equality and environmental protection. The 6th UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Youth Forum, which will focus on \"the Role of Youth in Poverty Eradication and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing World,\" provides a critical global platform where youth ministers and other government leaders, youth delegates, representatives from civil society and youth-focused organizations can contribute to discussions on issues affecting young people. This year, more than 500 youth advocates from around the world will participate in the forum to look at how young people can play an increasingly significant role in advancing implementation of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At the two-day annual event, participants will focus on several key areas, including poverty eradication; youth employment and economic empowerment; gender equality; health and wellbeing; climate change and the importance of technology in implementing the SDGs, as well as the need to identify regional priorities for youth development. The UN System in China consists of 25 UN funds, programs and specialized agencies resident in China. All UN entities in China work in partnership with governmental and non-governmental organizations at various levels to support the government to implement its national development objectives, as well as Internationally Agreed Development Goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals. The UN in China focuses its work on poverty reduction and equitable development, improved and sustainable environment, and enhanced global engagement. On Oct 24, the 71st anniversary of the UN, the UN System in China launched the UN China Imagine 2030 Campaign. The theme of this campaign is Imagine 2030, which aims to bring more young people's attention to development as well as SDGs, and calls on them to take action in implementing SDGs.
