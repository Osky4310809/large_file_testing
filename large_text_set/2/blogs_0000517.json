No US soldier was involved in the raid, though the Americans helped us track down Marwan and provided real-time intelligence on the day of the raid,” Napeñas said in a recent television interview, referring to terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir who was neutralized by the SAF troopers in an operation in January 2015. \nDuterte recently said the Mamasapano raid was a CIA operation, which former president Benigno Aquino III denied. \nNapeñas also said earlier ex-Philippine National Police chief Alan Purisima, who was suspended at the time, told him after a meeting with Aquino that he should inform then acting PNP chief Leonardo Espina about the operation much later. \nHe said Purisima was left inside the official residence of the former president after their meeting and only told him about the order to coordinate with other police and military officials after Purisima came out. \nAquino has been saying he told Purisima and Napeñas to coordinate the operation with Espina and then Armed Forces chief Gregorio Catapang Jr. but was not followed by his subordinates.   \nThis time, Napeñas recalled that in one of their meetings with Aquino, Purisima told him, “I will take care of General Catapang,” implying that the order was given in front of the two of them. \nHe said he took that to mean that Purisima would take care of coordinating with Catapang. \nBut Napeñas is denying he received orders directly from Aquino on the SAF operation, where 44 troopers were killed in ensuing encounters with Muslim guerrillas mostly belonging to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). \nHe said Aquino was dealing with Purisima and that they “were texting each other before and during the operation.” \nBoth Purisima and Napeñas have been slapped with charges in court in connection with the incident that Duterte blamed on Aquino. \nIn a statement last week, Aquino tossed the blame to Napeñas, claiming that had the then SAF chief coordinated their operation with the AFP as he had ordered, the commandos would have received support from mechanized and artillery units and even from the Air Force. \nHe said the massacre would not have happened.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:41:40.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
