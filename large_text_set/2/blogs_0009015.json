In this case, based on the brand’s performance we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.” \nPresident Trump wasn’t convinced, taking to Twitter where he blasted the retail chain for being “unfair” to his daughter. \nBaio made headlines back in March 2016 when he officially endorsed Donald Trump for president on Fox News’“Justice with Judge Jeanine Pirro.” \n“It’s very simple,” Baio said while explaining to Pirro why he supported Trump. \n“When he speaks I understand him. He speaks like I speak. He communicates with people very well,” Baio added, CNN reported .
