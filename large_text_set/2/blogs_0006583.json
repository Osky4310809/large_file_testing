Ahead of the unveiling, the rumour mill has already revealed a number of their key specs. Now, a report citing an unnamed Samsung official has revealed the battery information of the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. \nAccording to The Investor , the Samsung Galaxy S8 will feature a 3,000mAh battery, while its bigger sibling, the Galaxy S8 Plus will get a beefier 3,500mAh battery. It appears that the latter will be offering the same battery capacity as the failed Galaxy Note7 flagship. The report suggests that the Galaxy S8 will rock a 5.7-inch display, while the Galaxy S8 Plus will feature a 6.2-inch screen. \nIn related news, some renders and a 360-degree video of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus leaked recently. The images revealed that the upcoming phones will not feature physical home buttons, and their fingerprint sensors will be moved to the back panel.
