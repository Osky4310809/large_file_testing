The younger actor took on the role of Professor X years ago in X-Men: First Class and has continued to play the psychic mutant in various films since. Last year, the actor reprised the role in X-Men: Apocalypse , and rumors have swirled that McAvoy is attached to 20th Century Fox’s New Mutants project. And, now, the actor is dropping hints about his X-Men future over on Instagram. (Photo: 20th Century Fox ) \nTaking to social media, McAvoy shared a touching picture taken by Simon David Kinberg, a noted X-Men producer. The actor grabbed dinner with the creator, and Kinberg’s split image also shows him drinking with Stewart at another venue. \n“Dinner last night with the man who’s in a multi generational three way relationship with two professors.thanks for dinner @simondavidkinberg and @hutch.parker ,I can’t wait for the summer,” McAvoy captioned the image. \nOf course, fans are honing in on one particular point of McAvoy’s caption. The actor confesses he can’t wait for the summer, hinting his involvement with one of the X-Men films heading into production at that time. \nHowever, fans are now debating which of the projects McAvoy may be referring to. In the past, Kinberg has all but confirmed McAvoy’s involvement with X-Men: The New Mutants . He told Collider the film would include Professor X, so McAvoy has some security there. Still, fans are wondering if McAvoy will be pulling double-duty when it comes to filming this summer. \nReports have long said another X-Men movie will delve into production in May, and Sophie Turner said the project would being filming shortly not long ago. While much about the film remains a mystery, its various working titles have led fans to speculate Turner’s X-Men film will somehow adapt the ‘Dark Phoenix Saga’ from the comic canon. Kinberg, who is also scripting the feature, has said before the saga could possibly revisited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:00:09.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
