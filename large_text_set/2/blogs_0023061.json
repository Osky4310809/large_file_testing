But good news for viewers—unlike TV, you won't see the (up to 20 second) ad until at least 4 minutes into the live video. After that, publishers can take additional ad breaks \"after a minimum of 5 minutes between each break,\" says Facebook. \nFacebook's main video rival, YouTube, offers video creators 55% of the ad revenues generated, and creators have been waiting for Facebook to respond with a monetization offer. \nFacebook said in June that it would come up with a plan for video creators to monetize. In the blog post today, Facebook didn't specify how it would split revenues, except to say, \"The broadcaster will earn a share of the resulting ad revenue. \" \nThe ad breaks are only available to U.S. broadcasters, but Facebook says it hopes to expand to additional countries in the future. \nFor video publishers who want to test out ad breaks in their non-live videos, Facebook says it's working with \"a handful of partners,\" on a beta test for this now, and will open it up to others in the coming months.
