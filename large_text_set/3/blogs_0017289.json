Fees are paid on a module-by-module basis – you won't have to pay for the whole of your qualification up front. A qualification comprises a series of modules, each with an individual fee.

Our current fee for 60 credits is £2,864*. Our current fee for 120 credits – which is equivalent to a year's full-time study – is £5,728*. At current prices, the total cost of your qualification would be £17,184*. \n*The fee information provided here is valid for modules starting before 31 July 2018. Fees normally increase annually in line with inflation and the University's strategic approach to fees.
