In front of scouts from all 32 teams as well as 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan and Panthers coach Ron Rivera, McCaffrey ran routes with receivers Michael Rector and Francis Owusu and fielded passes from Chris Bonner. After showing out at the combine, McCaffrey decided to not do any testing, such as the 40, bench press and vertical leap. He didn’t need to. \nIn the months preceding the combine and Thursday’s pro day, McCaffrey trained at Landow Performance in Centennial, where he worked with multiple former Broncos, including slot receiver Brandon Stokley . \nMcCaffrey’s versatility has made him an interesting prospect for multiple teams, especially the Broncos, who own the No. 20 pick in the first round and need help in the return game, in slot and at running back. \nIn Indianapolis, McCaffrey had an informal interview with head coach Vance Joseph and general manager John Elway , both of whom sung his praises. \n“This kid is a really good football player,” Joseph said. “If you watch the tape, he’s a pro’s pro.” \nThe McCaffrey connections to the Broncos run deep with his father Ed’s storied career in Denver as a receiver alongside Elway, a Stanford grad. \n“That would be awesome. That would be great,” McCaffrey said at the combine of potentially playing for the Broncos. “I would love to play there. But it’s kind of hard to be a fan of anywhere anymore cause you start to wind down things and you don’t know where you’re going to end up. I’ll be happy to play for anybody.” \nSome highlights of McCaffrey at Stanford’s pro day: A post shared by Christian McCaffrey (@run__cmc) on Mar 23, 2017 at 5:16pm PDT McCaffrey showing off his hands doing wr drills. pic.twitter.com/Ori4d3XdZ9 \n— Alex Flanagan (@Alex_Flanagan) March 23, 2017 Christian McCaffrey almost catches 3 out of the Jugs machine pic.twitter.com/lJgpfNCgde \n— Courtney Cronin (@CourtneyRCronin) March 23, 2017 Christian McCaffrey returns kicks from Conrad Ukropina at Stanford pro day. pic.twitter.com/3rPmFiP9Og \n— Courtney Cronin (@CourtneyRCronin) March 23, 2017 NFL scouts seated at the 50 yard line for Stanford’s pro day.
