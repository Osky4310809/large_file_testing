Michael Flynn \n“Regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology,” read Flynn’s letter, a copy of which was released by the White House. \nThe White House said Trump has named retired lieutenant general Joseph Kellogg, a decorated Vietnam war veteran who was serving as a director on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to be interim national security advisor. \nFlynn’s resignation so early in a US administration is unprecedented, and comes after details of his calls with the Russian diplomat were made public — increasing pressure on Trump to take action. \nSeveral US media outlets on Monday reported that top Trump advisers were warned about Flynn’s contacts with the Russians early this year. \nQuestions will now be raised about who knew about the calls, and why Trump did not move earlier to replace Flynn. \nFlynn’s resignation will also fuel calls for an independent investigation into Russia’s influence during the 2016 US presidential election. \nEarlier in the day White House spokesman Sean Spicer insisted Trump was not consulted about Flynn discussing sanctions, nor did he task Flynn to do so. \nAsked if Trump was aware Flynn would discuss sanctions with the Russian envoy, Spicer said: “No, absolutely not. No way.” \n– Blackmail? – \nA former head of defense intelligence, Flynn’s encounters with Russian President Vladimir Putin had already drawn criticism. \nUS media reported Monday that the Justice Department had warned the White House that Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the contents of his talks with Kislyak, and that it could make him vulnerable to Russian blackmail. \nThe message was delivered in the last days of Barack Obama’s administration by then-acting attorney general Sally Yates — who Trump sacked after she instructed Justice Department lawyers not to defend his contested travel ban. \nCNN said then director of national intelligence James Clapper and John Brennan, the CIA chief at the time, agreed the White House should be alerted about the concerns. \nIn the hours before his resignation, some Trump aides suggested that Flynn had the full support of the president. \nUntil now, Flynn had been an instrumental player in Trump’s inner circle. \nHe was an early supporter of Trump’s improbable bid for the presidency and has encouraged tougher policies on Iran and a softer policy on Russia. \nThat was a sharp break with the Obama administration, which introduced sanctions over Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea, support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, and what US intelligence says were its attempts to sway the 2016 election in Trump’s favor. \nWashington and Moscow had also clashed over alleged war crimes in Syria, where Russia is accused of aiding the bombing of hospitals and other civilian targets. Despite this, Flynn had argued for rapprochement. \nA few of Trump’s fellow Republicans had joined their Democratic foes in urging Flynn to resign over a situation that had become a major embarrassment for the ruling party. \n“It is his duty to be fully transparent and forthright in his actions — anything less is unacceptable,” Representative Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, said in a statement. \n“If in fact he purposely misled the president, he should step down immediately.” \n– Moscow links probed – \nFlynn’s resignation took place just days before his first official talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussions in which the president’s national security advisor would normally have a key role. \nThe Justice Department and Congress are both investigating possible links between Trump campaign advisors and Moscow, and US intelligence has concluded that Putin personally directed an operation to interfere in the US election. \nOn December 29, the Obama administration sanctioned four Russian individuals and five entities, and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation.
