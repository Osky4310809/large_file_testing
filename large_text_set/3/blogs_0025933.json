I wasn't frustrated that I was all square,” Johnson said. “I came back, made a nice birdie on 13 and won that hole and then birdied 15 and 16 to win, too. Came back strong after losing three holes in a row.” \nJohnson will face Hideto Tanihara in Sunday’s semifinal round and can become the first player to win all four World Golf Championships and his third consecutive start.
