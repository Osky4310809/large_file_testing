Devin Nunes said at a press conference Wednesday. Nunes emphasized that he believes it was all obtained legally, and noted that none of the information was related to Russia.\nThe details about the people associated with the Administration had “little or no apparent foreign intelligence value” he said, but were widely disseminated in intelligence reporting.\nThe House Intelligence committee will conduct an investigation following these revelations to see if any procedures were violated. Nunes said he expects the NSA to provide more information by Friday. He is still waiting to speak with FBI Director James Comey.\n“It was a lot of information on the President-elect and the transition team and what they were doing,” Nunes said.\nSources came to him legally with this information, he said.\nNunes said the Trump Administration wasn’t aware yet, and he was heading to the White House later in the day to brief the President about the new information.\nHe did note that this does not change his belief that there is no evidence a wiretap was ordered on Trump Tower.\n“But,” he said, “What I read was clearly significant information about Trump and his team.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:07:51.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
