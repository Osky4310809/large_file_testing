Our field operatives and colleagues, especially the NANS president and his executive, have come under constant threats and assassination attempts. \n“We will not back down or back out until our academic institutions become the Ivory Towers they are meant to be,” Obasi said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:59:53.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
