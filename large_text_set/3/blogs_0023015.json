By Jason Samenow By Jason Samenow March 21 at 12:21 PM Follow @capitalweather National Hurricane Center director Rick Knabb conducts television interview from in-house studio (AP/Alan Diaz) \nThe National Hurricane Center announced Tuesday morning that its director, Rick Knabb, is leaving and has accepted the position as on-air hurricane expert at The Weather Channel. \nKnabb joined the Hurricane Center in June 2012 and his last day will be May 12 this year, the Hurricane Center said. \nDuring Knabb’s tenure, the Hurricane Center’s accuracy in predicting the track and intensity of hurricane increased steadily. It also introduced new products for communicating the risk of hurricane hazards such as storm surge at the very local level. Average error in National Hurricane Center track forecast of tropical weather systems from 1990 to 2015 in Atlantic. (National Hurricane Center) \n“I want to personally thank Rick for championing innovation at the National Hurricane Center during his five-year tenure as director,” said Louis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service. “Under his watch, NHC launched several new decision support tools to help America prepare for and respond to hurricane threats.” [ The National Weather Service just issued its first storm surge warning ] \nKnabb led the Weather Service through the busy 2016 hurricane season, which produced 15 named storms and seven hurricanes, including Matthew. While he was fortunate in that no major hurricane, Category 3 or higher, struck U.S. shores during his tenure, Superstorm Sandy crashed ashore in coastal New Jersey in his first full season on the job. \nIn all, Knabb presided over four hurricane landfalls on U.S. shores: Isaac (2012), Arthur (2014), Hermine (2016), and Matthew (2016). \nColleagues described him as competent and effective. \n“My impression was that he was well-liked and respected there,” said Brian McNoldy, a tropical weather researcher at the University of Miami and Capital Weather Gang’s tropical weather expert. \n“I’ve heard nothing but exceptional things about him,” added Ryan Maue, meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics. “In the last five years, everything has improved markedly [at the Hurricane Center].” \nWhen Knabb moves to The Weather Channel, it will be his second stint there. He served as an on-air hurricane expert at the channel from 2010 to 2012, before joining the Hurricane Center. \n“I am moving on to a new and exciting opportunity that will not only allow me to spend less time traveling and more time at home with family, but extensive time in the studio at The Weather Channel focusing on hurricane and disaster safety communication that has become my greatest passion,” Knabb said. “In my new job, I look forward to utilizing all of the innovative products and warnings that we developed at the National Hurricane Center during the past several years.” Beyond excited to have @NHCDirector back @weatherchannel as our expert!His dedication to the science & protecting lives is second to none! \n— Jim Cantore (@JimCantore) March 21, 2017 Couldn't be more pleased to see my colleague @NHCDirector returning to @weatherchannel .

Ed Rappaport, a 17-year veteran of the Hurricane Center, will serve as the acting director while the National Weather Service conducts a search for the next director. EXCITING NEWS! Dr. Rick Knabb, Director of the National Hurricane Center returns to the @weatherchannel ! #expert \n— Mike Seidel (@mikeseidel) March 21, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:38:54.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
