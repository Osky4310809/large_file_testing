Though he was due to serve 70 years , he will be released on May 17.\nRivera was born in Puerto Rico and lived in Chicago after serving in the Vietnam War, where he earned a Bronze Star but became disillusioned by American imperialism. He became a member of the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional ( FALN ), a group responsible for dozens of bombings and several deaths. He was captured by the FBI and convicted of “seditious conspiracy.”\nHuman rights organizations and high-profile figures like Lin-Manuel Miranda and Bernie Sanders have called for his release, and Rivera maintains that he is a political prisoner. Though he was offered commutation by President Bill Clinton in 1999, he rejected it based on certain conditions of the deal.\nSanders and other supporters applauded the news on Twitter:\nI appreciate @POTUS listening to Puerto Ricans and people worldwide who believe Oscar Lopez Rivera deserves a chance to enjoy his freedom.\n— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 17, 2017 \nOscar Lopez Rivera has been pardoned 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷 #ComingHome \n— Gina Rodriguez (@HereIsGina) January 17, 2017 \n[ Telesur ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:56:51.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
