It's just that blemishes on your face don't go unnoticed, and get treated in time, for obvious reasons. On top of that, they are easy to camouflage compared to zits that pop up on your back. It's all okay in winters, but what about when the bikini-season comes and you can't wear that sexy halter dress. Here is how you can actually get rid of back acne (bacne), and be at peace with yourself. Use a pH balanced body wash \nDon't just focus on the right face wash. Pay attention to your body as well. Just like your face needs TLC, your body needs it too. Shower gels are usually harsher and less sophisticated than facial cleansers, so choose a body cleanser that is suited to your needs. Shower the bacteria away \nDo you usually skip the shower at the gym, and wait until you get home? Don't. The sweat that builds up between the skin and the gym clothes can awaken acne-causing bacteria, and can lead to a post-gym breakout. Shower right after your workout to avoid bacteria from clogging your pores. Invest in a body scrub \nA good scrub is an in-shower must-have for all skin types, but especially those suffering from body acne. A body scrub enables skin renewal, while resurfacing and refreshing your body's skin cells. Even if you have sensitive skin, use an exfoliator to help get rid of the dead skin cells, and to unclog the pores. Change your diet \nIt's all well and good treating bacne from the outside, but more often than not it's because of your unhealthy diet and lifestyle. So, try to eat healthy and follow a cooling diet. Drink plenty of water, and switch your lifestyle to get rid of those pesky zits. Protect yourself \nIf you're dealing with bacne, you likely have a few frustrating acne scars to show for it. And the only thing that can make acne bigger and long-lasting is sun exposure, which causes the pigment to deepen in your skin. If you're outside, or even near a window, with the acne scars exposed, the sun will make them worse, and permanent. So, you really have to wear sunscreen on your back if you want to fully treat bacne. It's not only to protect your back from the harmful rays, but to also prevent it from permanent scarring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T09:38:38.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
