Germany is top of Russian hackers’ list | Natalie Nougayrède Read more \nTrump’s policy towards Russia is the subject of intense interest in Washington amid a Senate inquiry into allegations that the Kremlin ordered a hacking operation against the Democratic party to help the billionaire politician win the November election. \nTrump – who has praised Vladimir Putin for being “very smart” – said he was willing to meet the Russian president in the months after he moves into the White House following his January 20 inauguration. \n“I understand that they would like to meet, and that’s absolutely fine with me,” he said. \nControversy also surrounds the Trump administrations’s attitude towards China, with soon-to-be secretary of state Rex Tillerson warning Beijing this week that China would “not be allowed access” to its artificial islands in the South China Sea. \nAsked if he supported the “One China” policy on Taiwan that has underpinned US relations with Beijing for decades, Trump said: “Everything is under negotiation including ‘One China’,” the Journal reported. \nTrump caused offence in Beijing when he took a congratulatory telephone call from Taiwan’s president in the wake of his election victory – a breach of the “One China” protocol under which Washington agreed to withdraw diplomatic recognition of the island nation as part of a deal to open up relations with the mainland. \nOn Taiwan, he told the Journal: “We sold them $2bn of military equipment last year. We can sell them $2bn of the latest and greatest military equipment but we’re not allowed to accept a phone call. First of all it would have been very rude not to accept the phone call.” \nDuring the election campaign Trump said he would label China a currency manipulator on the first day of taking office. The yuan has fallen steadily against the dollar in recent years, bringing accusations from the US that Beijing has deliberately forced its currency lower to gain a market advantage for its exports.

It’s not dropping. They’re doing it on purpose. \n“Our companies can’t compete with them now because our currency is strong and it’s killing us,” Trump said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T06:25:05.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
