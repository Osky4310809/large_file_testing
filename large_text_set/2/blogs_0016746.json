By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 22, 2017 6:08 PM While fake currency notes of the denomination Rs 100 is also in circulation, ISI will start printing high quality Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes. \nIn major alarm for the country, intelligence inputs has today confirmed that Pakistan’s spy agency ISI has activated its networks in Bangladesh and Nepal, to once again circulate fake currency notes across the country. According to a report by the India Today, there were intelligence inputs stating that the Pakistan spy agency has roped in absconding don Dawood Ibrahim’s men who function from Mumbai. While fake currency notes of the denomination Rs 100 is also in circulation, ISI will start printing high quality Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes. \nThe PM Narendra Modi note ban drive is under organised onslaught from Pakistan-based elements. Yesterday, a Pakistan fake currency note module that pumps high value Indian currency, consisting of Rs 2,000 notes, from Bangladesh has been exposed in the Malda District of West Bengal. An unidentified counterfeit currency runner has admitted to the fact in a video. The notes are of good enough quality to fool the common people and only an expert with the help of machines can tell the difference. Security agencies have arrested a gang that is working to push fake currency through Bangladesh into India via Malda in West Bengal. \nAlso Watch: \nIn another instance of demonetisation drive not being able to prevent or control the inflow of fake currency notes across the country, the Border Security Force (BSF), on Februray 20, has revealed that its men have arrested a resident of Nadia district with Rs 96,000 in duplicate notes. The fake notes were in the form of Rs 2000 denomination notes and the arrest was in in Malda’s Baisnabnagar. Analysts and political opposition had highlighted their concerns that the scrapping of the Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes were all very well to fight generation of fake currency and black money , but the printing of the Rs 2000 note is likely to increase, rather than decrease due to the availability of this high denomination note. However, the government has said that the new notes, both Rs 2000 and Rs 500 are quite secure as they carry a number of new high-security features. \nNevertheless, the increasing number of people being caught with fake currency also shows that wrongdoers are not being deterred from indulging in printing illegal currency. These fake notes are originating from Pakistan and that country has been pushing fake currency for decades now in an effort to foment terror and other extremist related activities in India.
