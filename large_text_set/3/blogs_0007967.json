As noted in a 1956 paper titled “Cerebral Manifestations of Vitamin B12 Deficiency” published in the British Medical Journal: 8 , 9 \n“In a series of 25 cases of vitamin B12 deficiency syndrome with involvement of the nervous system … I have encountered 14 cases with well-marked cerebral symptoms … \nThe mental symptoms are extremely variable and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, memory defect which may be gross, confusion, severe agitation and depression, delusions and paranoid behavior, visual and auditory hallucinations … violent maniacal behavior and epilepsy. \nNone of these symptoms is pathognomonic [ed.note: characteristic of the disease] , and in their absence of anemia or of spinal signs the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency may never be considered until the psychosis is far too advanced to respond to treatment.” B12 Deficiency Is Common \nWhile vitamin B12 is easily obtained from animal protein foods such as meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs, advancing age can diminish your body’s ability to absorb the vitamin from food. 10 Your body’s ability to absorb B12 depends on three factors: adequate stomach acid, the enzyme pepsin and gastric intrinsic factor. With age, stomach acid often diminishes. You may also have insufficient amounts of acid if you take acid blockers for heartburn. \nMany also lack gastric intrinsic factor. Pernicious anemia is an even greater concern, as this condition effectively prevents the absorption of B12. Vegans and strict vegetarians are also at high risk of B12 deficiency unless they take a high-quality supplement, since B12 is primarily obtained from animal foods. \nAs noted by Dr. Rajaprabhakaran Rajarethinam, a psychiatrist at Wayne State University School of Medicine and co-author of a 2009 case report on vitamin B12 deficiency and depression in the elderly: 11 \n“[I]t is estimated that 10 to 15 percent of individuals over the age of 60 years may suffer from B12 deficiency and it is believed that atrophic gastritis type B, which may afflict 20 to 50 percent of the elderly, may lead to poor absorption of B12 and folate … \nIn this report, we describe an elderly woman who suffered from severe psychotic depression who did not improve with conventional treatment but recovered significantly following administration of vitamin B12, illustrating the possibility that vitamin B12 deficiency may play a role in the development of mood disorder.” B Vitamins Also Protect Against Dementia and Slows Alzheimer’s \nVitamins B6, B9 (folate, or folic acid in its synthetic form) and B12 have also made headlines for their powerful role in preventing cognitive decline and more serious dementia such as Alzheimer's disease. In fact, mental fogginess and memory problems are two of the top warning signs of vitamin B12 deficiency, indicating its importance for brain health. \nHere, one of the mechanisms of action is the suppression of homocysteine, which tends to be elevated when you have brain degeneration. One study confirming this was published in 2010. 12 Participants received either a placebo or 800 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid, 500 mcg of B12 and 20 mg of B6. The study was based on the presumption that by controlling homocysteine levels you might be able to reduce brain shrinkage, thereby slowing the onset of Alzheimer’s. \nIndeed, after two years those who received the vitamin-B regimen had significantly less brain shrinkage compared to the placebo group. Those who had the highest levels of homocysteine at the start of the trial experienced brain shrinkage at half the rate of those taking a placebo. \nA 2013 study 13 took this research a step further, showing that not only do B vitamins slow brain shrinkage, but they specifically slow shrinkage in brain regions known to be most severely impacted by Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, in those specific areas the shrinkage is decreased by as much as 700 percent! As in the previous study, participants taking high doses of folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 lowered their blood levels of homocysteine, and brain shrinkage was decreased by as much as 90 percent. Where to Find These Valuable Brain Nutrients \nMood disorders, cognitive decline and psychiatric problems can have many underlying factors, but addressing your diet is often a good place to start. Not only can nutritional deficiencies wreak havoc with your brain function, your gut health also plays an important role, and toxic exposures from your diet or environment can also contribute. \nIdeally, you’d want to address all of these issues. I’ve written extensively about all of them. As for nutritional deficiencies, B vitamins appear to be very important, as are animal-based omega-3 , vitamin C and vitamin D . As a general rule, I recommend getting most if not all of your nutrition from REAL FOOD , ideally organic to avoid toxic pesticides, and locally grown. Depending on your situation and condition however, you may need one or more supplements. \nTo start, review the following listing of foods that contain the B vitamins discussed in this article. If you find that you rarely or never eat foods rich in one or more of these nutrients, you may want to consider taking a high quality, ideally food-based supplement. \nAlso consider limiting sugar and eating fermented foods . The entire B group vitamin series is produced within your gut, assuming you have healthy gut flora. Eating real food, ideally organic, along with fermented foods will provide your microbiome with important fiber and beneficial bacteria to help optimize your internal vitamin B production. Nutrient Supplement Recommendations \nNutrient: Niacin (B3) \nDietary Sources: Liver, chicken, veal, peanuts, chili powder, bacon and sun dried tomatoes have some of the highest amounts of niacin per gram. 14 \nOther niacin-rich foods include baker’s yeast, paprika, espresso coffee, anchovies, spirulina, duck, shiitake mushrooms and soy sauce 15 \nSupplement Recommendations: The dietary reference intake established by the Food and Nutrition Board ranges from 14 to 18 mg per day for adults. \nHigher amounts are recommended depending on your condition. For a list of recommended dosages, see the Mayo Clinic’s website. 16 \nFor pellagra, discussed above, doses range from 50 to 1,000 mg daily. \nNutrient: Vitamin B6 \nDietary Sources: Turkey, beef, chicken, wild-caught salmon , sweet potatoes, potatoes, sunflower seeds, pistachios, avocado , spinach and banana. 17 , 18 \nSupplement Recommendations: Nutritional yeast is an excellent source of B vitamins, especially B6. 19 One serving (2 tablespoons) contains nearly 10 mg of vitamin B6. \nNot to be confused with Brewer’s yeast or other active yeasts, nutritional yeast is made from an organism grown on molasses, which is then harvested and dried to deactivate the yeast. \nIt has a pleasant cheesy flavor and can be added to a number of different dishes. \nNutrient: B8 (inositol/biotin) \nDietary Sources: Meat, egg yolks, fish, liver, poultry, nuts and legumes. 20 \nSupplement Recommendations: B8 is not recognized as an essential nutrient and no recommended daily intake has been set. \nThat said, it’s believed you need about 300 mcg per day. \nVitamin B8 is sometimes listed as biotin on supplements. Brewer’s yeast is a natural supplemental source. 21 \nNutrient: Folate (B9) \nDietary Sources: Fresh, raw, organic leafy green vegetables, especially broccoli , asparagus, spinach and turnip greens, and a wide variety of beans, especially lentils, but also pinto beans, garbanzo beans , kidney beans, navy and black beans. 22 \nSupplement Recommendations: Folic acid is a synthetic type of B vitamin used in supplements; folate is the natural form found in foods. (Think: folatecomes from foliage, edible leafy plants.) \nFor folic acid to be of use, it must first be activated into its biologically active form (L-5-MTHF). \nThis is the form able to cross the blood-brain barrier to give you the brain benefits noted. \nNearly half of the population has difficulty converting folic acid into the bioactive form due to a genetic reduction in enzyme activity. \nFor this reason, if you take a B-vitamin supplement, make sure it contains natural folate rather than synthetic folic acid. \nNutritional yeast is an excellent source. 23 \nNutrient: Vitamin B12 \nDietary Sources: Vitamin B12 is found almost exclusively in animal tissues, including foods like beef and beef liver, lamb, snapper, venison, salmon, shrimp, scallops, poultry, eggs and dairy products. \nThe few plant foods that are sources of B12 are actually B12 analogs that block the uptake of true B12. \nSupplement Recommendations: Nutritional yeast is also high in B12, and is highly recommended for vegetarians and vegans. \nOne serving (2 tbsp.) provides nearly 8 mcg of natural vitamin B12. 24 \nSublingual (under-the-tongue) fine mist spray or vitamin B12 injections are also effective, as they allow the large B12 molecule to be absorbed directly into your bloodstream. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T09:45:18.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
