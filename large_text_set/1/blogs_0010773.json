This is Vishal Mehra, and I will be bringing you the live cricket scores and update of the play on Day Three. The opening Test of this two-match series is being played at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. It has been Bangladesh all the way so far in this Test, who will be resuming their first innings at a mammoth total of 547 for 7, looking to add a few more to their total and try and make New Zealand bat twice. \nNew Zealand were expected to continue with their domination over Bangladesh in the ongoing Test, especially after comprehensive victories in the ODI and T20I series. In the limited-overs leg of Bangladesh’s tour of New Zealand 2017, the hosts had emerged victorious by margins of 3-0 in both series. Everyone expected that the Test series will be a one-way affair as well. However, Bangladesh had other plans. They came out with a purpose, went after the bowling hard, and produced a memorable batting performance over the last two days to serve a more-than-gentle warning to New Zealand. \nFull Cricket Scorecard: Bangladesh vs New Zealand, 1st Test Wellington \nNot surprisingly, Bangladesh have found their heroes in Shakib Al Hasan and captain Mushfiqur Rahim. The two men have etched their names in the history books following their stunning performances against New Zealand. Shakib scored 217, the highest individual total by any Bangladeshi in Test cricket, while Mushfiqur got 159 to strengthen his team’s position in the contest. \nShakib and Mushfiqur added 359 runs for the fifth wicket, now the fourth-highest fifth-wicket partnership in the history of Test cricket. Their partnership is now the highest by any Bangladeshi pair for any wicket. Shakib also completed his 3,000 runs in Test cricket, and went past Habibul Bashar. Of his countrymen, only Tamim Iqbal has more runs. \nShakib batted aggressively. His 217 came off a mere 276 balls. He hit a total of 31 boundaries in the process. On the other hand, Mushfiqur faced 260 balls, struck 23 boundaries and a six to score 159. \nAt stumps on the second day, Bangladesh had the contest in their firm grip. Another 50-odd runs will take them closer to the 600-run mark — a total that would be more than enough to exert pressure on the New Zealand batsmen.
