However, a new report from The Hollywood Reporter makes it sound like this whole candy-ass feud is still going on. \nAccording to the story, Diesel and Johnson are being “kept from one another” during the Fate Of The Furious press tour, and Johnson is even skipping a big screening of footage from the film during CinemaCon in Las Vegas today. Universal, the studio behind Fate , says the two have simply been separated because of their busy schedules, but THR ‘s insider sources don’t buy that. They say the schedules could’ve easily been shifted around so they could both attend the screening and promote the movie together, but the studio (or whoever) wants to keep Diesel and Johnson apart. \nThis does absolutely nothing to disprove that theory that this is all being done for the movie, but it does seem like they’re dragging this out for a long time if that’s the case. Luckily, Fate Of The Furious comes out on April 14, so maybe these candy-asses will be friends again after that. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:54:27.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
