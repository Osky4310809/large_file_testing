Jonathan travelled to watch Rafa's men in action (Photo: Serena Taylor) \nJonathan and his girlfriend managed to save around £50 on their travel by using the Rail Easy fare-splitting website. \nBut the couple were issued with a whopping 56 tickets to complete their journey. \nFare-splitting passengers exploit a legal loophole to buy different tickets for each stage of one journey, even if they are staying on the same train throughout. That's a lot of tickets (Photo: Jonathan Heywood) \nThe pair actually missed the match - which Newcastle lost 3-0 - as Jonathan says his girlfriend fell over in the stadium concourse and had to be treated in hospital. \nOn Twitter, Jonathan thanked his friend who suggested he try out ticket-splitting. \nHe lightheartedly branded the tip as “the worst advice” he had ever received. \nOn Twitter, he added: “FIFTY SIX TICKETS ARE YOU HAVING ME ON?” \nBut, the Toon supporter says he would use the service again to save money. \nHe told Chronicle Live : “Absolutely, I saved hassle by organising the tickets into four envelopes and sitting on two unreserved seats to avoid having to swap seats every stop.” \nIn May, rail companies including CrossCountry and Virgin will trial out a new ticketing system which aims to eliminate overpriced fares and the need to fare split. \nThe aim is to offer customers the cheapest price available for their journey and make ticket machines less confusing. \nPrevious research has found one in 20 passengers have been sold overpriced fares by machines. \nTicket machines have been found to promote expensive fares and “bury” cheaper ones, according to an investigation by the Telegraph. \nRail Delivery Group - the body which represents Britain’s 23 operating companies - says the jumped-up fares are due to red tape and a complicated ticketing system which has too many ticket options and is riddled with regulations.
