At least one image included Weiner’s young son sleeping in the background . According to the New York Post , sources are telling them that not only is Abedin giving her estranged husband another chance, but that their separation was “more for optics” and done under pressure from Clinton during her presidential campaign. \nFrom NY Post : \n“Huma has been working hard on her relationship with Anthony,” said a source close to the Abedin family. “He has been spending 80 to 90 percent of his time at the [Irving Place apartment] they share . . . If there is a disagreement, he goes to his mother’s apartment in Brooklyn. \n“Both [his and her] families are hoping they will reconcile.” \nWeiner’s problems began in 2011 after revelations that he sent a picture of his genitals to a woman on Twitter. The imbroglio ultimately forced the New York congressman to resign from office. Weiner’s scandals came up again during his campaign for New York City mayor in 2013, and his most recent incident led him to check into a rehab facility for cybersex addiction. \n[Image via shutterstock]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T17:44:27.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
