If I'm all those things, maybe he should be the one wearing glasses? I can't believe @kimkardashian is BFF's with this guy? What if North grows up and doesn't want to get any plastic surgery like me? Would he says the same things to her? The Kardashian brand should not be about putting down women based on their looks and he is part of their brand. He is on their reality show and apart of Kim's Hollywood game. People need to call this guy out on body shaming.

What he's saying to her over her fur comments is full-on body-shaming. It's gross and unacceptable. \nBTW, this is not the first time Sidley has gone after the Kardashians. A few months ago she also called out the fur choices of Khloe Kardashian — though we're guessing the Revenge Body host didn't call her a \"fat meas\" over it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:19:26.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
