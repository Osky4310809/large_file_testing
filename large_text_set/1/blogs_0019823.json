You have to pull him aside and tell him why he’s wrong, and then you can get him to go along with you. These people don’t know how to get him to do what they need him to do.” \nThis insider also told Politico that Trump “gets bored and likes to watch TV,” so it’s important for his aides to check his tendency to respond impulsively when angered, as well as control what information reaches him and gets taken seriously. \n“The truth of the matter is he had a successful inauguration with a respectful crowd. The transition of power went off without a hitch. His supporters were amiable by and large,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told Politico. “But then he can never let go and stop watching cable TV. Now he’s off to the worst start of a presidency in a very long time.” \nIt appears that many members of Trump’s inner circle urged him to not give into his resentment at the media’s reporting of his inauguration’s attendance figures, according to a report by The New York Times on Sunday . This did not succeed, as Trump ultimately allowed his resentment of his inauguration coverage to bleed into even unrelated priorities, like patching up his relationship with intelligence communities, prompting other members of Team Trump to try to spin away the president’s behavior. \n“Ultimately this is about governing,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to The Times. “There are two things he’s got to do between now and 2020: He has to keep America safe and create a lot of jobs. That’s what he promised in his speech. If he does those two things, everything else is noise.” “The average American isn’t paying attention to this stuff,” Gingrich added. “They are going to look around in late 2019 and early 2020 and ask themselves if they are doing better. If the answer’s yes, they are going to say, ‘Cool, give me some more.’” \nWhile there is no polling data yet on whether Trump’s unorthodox conduct during his first days as president has hurt him, he had incredibly low favorability ratings before even being sworn in.
