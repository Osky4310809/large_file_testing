Caganer \nA Catalonia specialty, the caganer is a little porcelain gnome-like figure with his trousers down who is seen defecating somewhere in the nativity scene. Children enjoy looking for the little guy, who is usually hidden among the more traditional items.

Chris Oakley/Creative Commons 7. Grape Eating at the Stroke of Midnight \nIf you're out in a public place in Spain on New Year's Eve, you will notice that everyone around you is carrying a handful of grapes.
