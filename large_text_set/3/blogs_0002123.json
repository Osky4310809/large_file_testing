After that, Trump explained that he spoke with Secretary of Defense James Mattis , who assured him that “Ryan was part of a highly successful raid.” \n“Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity,” Trump noted. \nAt this point, Mrs. Owens was given an even more sustained and loud standing ovation, all while her emotions overcame her. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T05:33:19.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
