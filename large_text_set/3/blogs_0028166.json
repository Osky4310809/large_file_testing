Her journey from a college grad to a Youtuber to a now, superstar entrepreneur is incredible and is definitely applause worthy. She has fans all over the world and her last tour was sold out in every city! How does she manage that? Singh will be visiting India for her How To Be A Bawse tour and will be in Mumbai on the 19th. Guess which superstar is hosting her during the time? Shah Rukh Khan ! \nYup, you read that right. Shah Rukh’s daughter Suhana is a big fan of Lilly’s, and even met with her the last time she was in Mumbai in 2014. This time, SRK will host a private evening at Mannat with Lilly and his kids. Francis Coelho, the managing director of Event Spectacle issued a statement on the same. \nEvery time she (Superwoman) visits India, quite a few Bollywood celebrities want to meet her and be inspired by her story as she is a motivational figure in that sense. In fact, Shah Rukh Khan will be the first Bollywood celebrity who will meet her when she comes to India this time. Lilly Singh has been an inspiration to millions of people around the globe irrespective of the age, gender, community. Having risen from depression, she struggled in the real world to be the entrepreneur that she is today. \nWow. This is going to be epic! 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:12:02.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
