In the brief clip shown, Luke asks Rey: “Who are you?” Rey responds by skilfully handing him her lightsaber. \nOther characters who appear in the footage include Chewbacca, Finn ( John Boyega ) and the late Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa. Fisher completed filming for The Last Jedi six months before her death in December last year . \nBefore screening the footage, Disney CEO Bob Iger addressed the audience. “We make a point of revealing very little from our upcoming Star Wars films,” he said. “We want to keep them secret. But we’re making an exception today. We’re going to show you an exclusive first look at what happens right after that scene, and that lightsaber being handed to its rightful owner.” Star Wars: The Last Jedi – the five most outlandish fan theories Read more \nIger also took the opportunity to pay tribute to Fisher. “Carrie Fisher has been an iconic part in this franchise from the very beginning,” he said. “We all miss her. She had great talent and wit. We’re proud that this movie coming up is part of her legacy.” \nWritten and directed by Rian Johnson (Brick, Looper ), The Last Jedi is the second in the sequel trilogy of Star Wars films. It’s direct predecessor, The Force Awakens, became the highest-grossing film of all time in both the US and the UK , going on to take over $2bn worldwide. \nDisney’s annual shareholder meeting takes place after a hugely successful 2016, which saw the film studio become the first in history to take over $7bn in global ticket sales in a year . However, the meeting was not without its controversy, with shareholders questioning Iger’s participation on Donald Trump’s business advisory council . Iger defended his position at the meeting. \nThe Last Jedi is scheduled for release in cinemas on 15 December.
