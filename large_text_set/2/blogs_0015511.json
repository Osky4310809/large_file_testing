It worked. In those opening exchanges, Arsenal's players were second guessing the bounce, taking two touches where one would ordinarily suffice. Nacho Monreal and Alex Iwobi were particularly troubled. But that wet pitch would eventually do Sutton as much harm as it did Arsenal. \nThe Gunners had barely troubled goalkeeper Ross Wormer until the 27th minute when Lucas Perez cut inside and hit what may well have been just a powerful low cross. But in a crowded penalty area, the ball hit the wet surface, skidded, accelerated and whizzed into the bottom corner. It provided Arsenal with the relief and the security they so desperately needed. \nThe Premier League side only arrived at Ganders Green Lane a mere 70 minutes before kick-off, eventually negotiating the thick South London traffic to take their places in their tiny, sparse dressing rooms. When they appeared for their warm-up, they were roundly jeered by the home supporters. But that was nothing compared to the treatment the Sutton players handed out. They flew into challenges, frequently leaving a little bit in on every tackle. \nSimon Downer set the tone with a nasty dig at Iwobi and it wasn't long before everyone was getting involved. Granit Xhaka, of course, needed no encouragement to return fire. He was in the book after just 24 minutes. \nArsenal remained vulnerable after the first goal. Rob Holding dawdled on the ball on the half-hour and nearly cost his side dearly. David Ospina inadvertently presented Adam May with a glorious opportunity, only to see May blast into the side-netting. There was a scare early in the second half too when Bedsente Gomis twisted and turned in the box only to see his shot blocked by the sudden encirclement of red shirts. \nIt wasn't until 10 minutes into the second half that Arsenal scored their second. A neat exchange of passes -- a rare thing indeed here -- culminated with a close-range finish and Walcott's 100th goal for the club. But even then they couldn't relax as Sutton redoubled their efforts. Captain Jamie Collins headed over from a corner. Deacon smashed a shot off the bar. Sutton fought gamely throughout but squandered their few good chances, like when Adam May, right, fired wide. \n2. Clever Sutton were full of tricks \nThe wet pitch wasn't Sutton's only gambit on Monday night. Seeking to maximise every set piece, they used their goalkeeper to take every free kick in their own half. They were not above a little gamesmanship either, with former Gunner Craig Eastmond making the most of a Monreal challenge in the box. \nManager Paul Doswell had made light suggestions that he would be changing his routine for this game, but it was clear that he had left no stone unturned in his search for marginal gains. Unfortunately, while Sutton's players lacked nothing in terms of effort and desire, they just couldn't raise their game high enough to threaten the Gunners until they were two goals down. \nWhen they did break toward goal, as they did frequently through another ex-Emirates alumni Roarie Deacon, there was no final ball. When there was a final ball, as there was to Maxime Biamou after Arsenal's second goal, there was no composure in the finish. Jamie Collins came close but his powerful header was over the bar. In a match like this, Arsenal would have to be very bad and Sutton would have to be very good. Neither description was entirely accurate. \nNevertheless, Sutton's run has been an incredible story and a much-needed shot in the arm for the FA Cup. More importantly, it's served as a reminder of the strength, and the warmth, of the game at the non-league level. \nSutton failed to pull off the ultimate upset but if this cup run is enough to convince a few hundred more of the local residents to visit Gander Green Lane on a regular basis, then it has been an unqualified success. \nWenger will be thrilled to put last week's Champions League mess behind them and safely advance in the FA Cup. \n3. Where do Arsenal go from here? \nThe manner of Monday's victory is unimportant. Only the victory counts. Anything else would have been a disaster and it's enough for Arsenal that another one of those has been avoided. Nothing can be taken for granted, especially where the Gunners are concerned, but their only obstacle to an FA Cup semifinal at Wembley is non-league Lincoln City at the Emirates Stadium. \nThis competition is much derided but it may yet provide silverware, and perhaps a dignified exit from the stage for Wenger. \nThere's certainly nothing solid that can be taken from this to serve as evidence that everything is alright again. Shortly before their second goal, there were sarcastic chants of \"We've had a shot!\" from the away end. The sight of Alexis Sanchez midway through the second half was a sign of how seriously Wenger needed this, for there was never a point when Arsenal looked truly comfortable. But all recoveries require a starting point. \nPerhaps Arsenal can draw strength from their resilience in testing circumstances. Perhaps they can start to put Munich behind them.
