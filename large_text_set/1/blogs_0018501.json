Posted: 3 years, 4 months ago at Sep 5 2:33 You should check out \"Relax... it's just sex\". Posted: 3 years, 4 months ago at Sep 5 3:48 Add \"The Sum of Us\"... an Australian movie with Russell Crowe (before he became annoying) moviebuff15 Posted: 3 years, 4 months ago at Sep 5 12:30 This list needs \"Gun Hill Road,\" about a transgendered M/F teenager who's dad gets out of prison. Also \"Ma Vie En Rose\" (also transgendered) and \"Any Day Now.\" My favorite on this list is \"Weekend.\" Posted: 3 years ago at Jan 9 1:03 I haven't even seen most of these... Interesting.... Posted: 3 years ago at Jan 12 11:40 Another nice titles: ToonHead2102 Posted: 2 years, 11 months ago at Feb 2 0:31 Aww, so cute, love all the entries on here, and the images to go with them, that I've seen... except one! Anyone in their right mind who's read the book will know without a doubt the novel is w y better than the movie adaptation of \"Dream Boy\". The film could have been an indie masterpiece - instead...? I agree with a couple or so of the above mentioned suggestions. Off the top of my head \"Happy Together\" really needs to be here! Ones that DESERVE to be here: -L.i.E. (helped me through a lot of crap I was going through back in the day) -C.R.A.Z.Y. (epic story) Posted: 2 years, 1 month ago at Dec 14 22:21 Excellent list, mate! Posted: 2 years ago at Jan 14 19:00 Great work! Just one suggestion: ToonHead2102 Posted: 1 year, 9 months ago at Apr 12 5:44 Just have to say real quick how obsessed with this list I've become lately, being nearly 50% through it now (not determinately though), so far I'd agree with just about everything except a few titles. The most recent ones that have really surprised me would definitely be \"Silent Youth\"; \"Test\" and \"Children of God\" (except for the last 8 minutes should have been shaved off...) Wasn't pleased with \"Dream Boy\", \"Our Paradise\", \"the String\", \"the Normal Heart\" or \"Monster Pies\". Not that I need a say but I only mention all this cause I'm more or less shocked this doesn't include \"Strapped\", \"I Love You, Phillip Morris\", \"the Wild Reeds\" (somebody already mentioned it above), \"Nico and Dani\", or \"Gohatto\". If we're talkin' the best... Posted: 1 year, 9 months ago at Apr 12 12:10 Hi ToonHead2102, Thanks for your comment! The list is subjective, because it is only made by one person, in this case I, it contains the movies I think the best, but the list is not static and I will adding movies whenever I wish. Posted: 1 year, 3 months ago at Sep 28 3:34 My favorite is Floating Skyscrapers Posted: 10 months, 1 week ago at Mar 14 22:40 My fav is Latter Days. Vedran Bralić II Posted: 1 week, 1 day ago at Jan 12 4:44 looking for a gay thriller about a guy who work as a security guard (money escort for a bank) who's boy friend working in a dinning. A group of robbers want to rob the bank track full of money... This movie I watched late 80s or early 90s on TV. I was a teen then, and the time past, so I forgot the name, and actors. So I really wants to see him again. Posted: 1 week ago at Jan 12 5:21 I think the movie you are looking for is this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T07:23:51.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
