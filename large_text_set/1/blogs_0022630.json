I think we are seeing the best moment of Pedro, I think that this Pedro played this type of football when he was in Barcelona. \n\"I hope that he continues in this way and continues to improve. He is a really important player for us. In the same was as Eden and Willy.\" \nMarcos Alonso is another player who has impressed Conte, after his brace last week against Leicester City, and he has been a regular since Chelsea switched to a 3-4-3 formation. \nConte: Why I brought Ake back to Chelsea \n\"Alonso is another player who is doing very well but I think the reason we are top of the table is because all our players are performing very well,\" he added. \"We are a team and in a team every single player is exalting his talent. \n\"It is important to continue this way to stay at the top of the table.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T01:11:30.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
