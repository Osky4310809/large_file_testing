Now, itâ€™s no news that The Kapil Sharma Show is a mandatory promotional ground for most Bollywood films and many celebrities consider it an important platform. Kapil Sharma Shraddha and Aditya reportedly reached TKSS sets at the scheduled time, i.e. 4 pm. But on their arrival, there were no signs of the shoot commencing anytime soon, due to which they had to wait for five hours before the shoot finally started. \nAccording to an entertainment portal, Shraddha was quite upset and even threatened to walk out. A source was also quoted saying that Aditya and Shraddha initially waited patiently, but later they were quite miffed with the makers. The shooting reportedly finally began after 5 hours, around 9 pm, and went on till late night. 68", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:05:58.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
