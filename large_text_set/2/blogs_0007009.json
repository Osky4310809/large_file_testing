It is motivated by the need to negotiate a better deal for the ordinary Nigerian. \n”I therefore announce the cancellation of the planned protest. \n“We would share further information in due course. We appreciate the massive support . \n“I am convinced our voices have been heard. \nMay God bless you all, may God bless Nigeria,” said the singer, in the audio-visual message that has soon gone viral on the internet. \nWhile critics of the protest continue to praise him for taking a wise step by desisting from an activity they thought was shifting his focus from his music career, his supporters have been divided in there reactions. To some, it was an act of cowardice to bow to pressure from security agencies while to others, the singer’s outcry in the last two weeks has created enough awareness on the grievances of the people against some of the unfavorable policies of government. \nMeanwhile, indication emerged early Sunday that the protest may continue without 2Face, as a group called Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution (CDNDC) has vowed to continue with the protest, saying it was never about 2Face and his group alone in the first place. \nIn a press statement issued by one Ariyo-Dare Atoye, co-convener, CDNDC, “the cancellation of #IStandWithNigeria rally is not the consensus of Nigerians, majority of fellow planners and not a true reflection of the sincere plan to organize this rally in public interest.” \nHe said: “Let it be known that Mr. Idibia merely keyed into an ongoing public discourse over this protest to take a lead. It was never his singular idea but the concerns of the suffering masses. \n\n“Therefore, we wish to inform concerned Nigerians and the international community that there is a national and public consensus for this protest to hold as scheduled in all venues. There are hundreds of groups and thousands of Nigerians who are leading this initiative and we will not back down.” \n\nAccording to Atoye, “This is the time to separate real activists from emergency activists. Emergency activists seek mortality with the fear of man, while revolutionists and real activists seek immortality with the fear of God. \n\n“Consequently, in the exact opposite of what our brother, 2Face said; “Dear Nigerians, due to stomach insecurity and bad governance consideration, we hereby announce the continuation of the march as scheduled – on Monday, February 6, 2017,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T16:27:18.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
