This is exactly what happened recently to the two lucky baby leopards in this video. \nThe two cubs, only three weeks old, were rescued by the Wildlife SOS team. They were found amidst sugarcane fields in Somatwadi village in Junnar, Maharashtra, India, by farmers who were working there. After a careful medical examination carried out by the rescue’s vets in the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Center, the cubs were prepared for the reunion in a special way – they were placed in transfer crates and positioned near the spot where their mother had last been sighted . The process was filmed by camera traps, thanks to which we can see the very moment when the female leopard found her babies. Once she noticed her little ones, she got them out of the crates and carried them back home into the forest! \nClick here to visit Wildlife SOS’s website and learn more about their great work and what you can do to support them.
