But perhaps that criticism is coming from the 52 percent of women and 16 percent of men who admit to being envious of romantic gestures they observe from others on Valentine's Day. \nThough it is a day of love, most advise against making the ultimate romantic gesture — a proposal or marriage — on V-Day, as 63 percent of women and 69 percent of men call it cliché . \n\n2. Turns out men and women have different ideas of what the perfect Valentine's Day date entails. \nMSN \nThe majority of men and women (50 and 60 percent, respectively) think a romantic weekend away is the perfect way to celebrate. But if your pockets aren't deep enough to jet set to a luxurious vacation spot this February, there are some less-expensive alternatives to try. \nLadies, 32 percent of men say they'd be happy fooling around in bed all day and 57 percent would enjoy a special massage . No word yet on the expectation for a happy ending. \n\nGurl \nMany associate Valentine’s Day with some gift staples — a box of chocolates, a cuddly teddy or a single red rose, to start. But love this holiday doesn't have to come from a drug store, fellas — nor should it. \nForty-five percent of men think flowers are the way to say \"I love you\" on February 14, but only 4 percent of women agree. Rather, one-third of women want jewelry and 40 percent want to be treated to a day at the spa. \nLadies, when buying for your man, one-fifth would prefer tickets to the big game. However, a whopping 70 percent of men just want some sex . \nSo it’s safe to say men aren’t as interested in the traditional Valentine’s Day present, unless the gift is in the bedroom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:31:28.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
