The Counter-Strike players for the esports organization Team SoloMid have all left following a dispute with owners over which leagues they could play in. Instead, the squad have all joined with Misfits, an organization that just this week announced its new partnership with the Miami Heat .\n\nAdvertisement \n\nNews came by way of two announcements, first from TSM, acknowledging the departure, and later in the afternoon from Misfits, revealing the roster for its new Counter-Strike team. Sean ‘sgares’ Gares, Russel ‘Twistzz’ David Van Dulken, Shahzeb ‘ShahZaM’ Khan, Skyler ‘Relyks’ Weaver, and Hunter ‘SicK’ Mims, a week after the team earned a spot in the North America EPL, will all be outfitted in uniforms to match the Heat’s colors before long.\n\nThe rift between the players and their former team began late last year when the owners tried to restrict them from playing in certain leagues. TSM were partners in a newly formed league called the PEA, one that would be owned and operated by the teams themselves rather than a third-party. The teams involved were in talks to have their players compete exclusively in the PEA, rather than other, more established leagues like the ESL. A public letter from the players affected, not only at TSM, but from other teams as well, called out owners for not including them in the decision making process.\n\nCounter-Strike League Shuts Down After Players Organize Against Owners Counter-Strike League Shuts Down After Players Organize Against Owners Counter-Strike League Shuts Down After Players… Earlier this year, a new esports league, The Professional eSports Association (PEA), burst onto the … Read more Read more \nIn response, TSM owner Andy “Reginald” Dinh fired one of the players , sgares, for his role in organizing the team’s dissent . The situation only deteriorated from there, eventually leading the Counter-Strike organizations involved to abandon the PEA entirely. But for TSM and its players at least, the damage was already done. In the statement announcing the players’ departure, TSM said,\nAdvertisement \n\n“This decision was made after the relationships between the organization and the remaining players continued to deteriorate over the past few weeks, partly in due to the remaining squad’s explicit desire to continue playing together with sgares.”\nSgares had only joined TSM in late December of last year, arriving from Echo Fox along with ShahZaM. The vision for a new TSM going into the new year, however, was short lived.\n\nNow, both players, along with Twistzz, Relyks and SicK, will be playing on for Misfits as part of the organization’s newly formed Counter-Strike team. The organization was previously known mostly for its League of Legends team, and more recently its forays into shooters and fighting games, but as one of esports biggest games, entering the world of Counter-Strike presents a number of new opportunities for investment. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:00:12.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
