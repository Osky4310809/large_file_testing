Just because you have an inanimate object as a team name doesn't need you need to anthropomorphize it. \nb. Is the red sock really big or is his hat really small? Think on it - it's like that stupid dress that's totally blue . (Also, congrats to Bill Clinton for having the Wikipedia entry for \"The Dress\" not be about him. A nice upset there.) \nc. The batting stance is pretty good. \nd. I already used up my innuendo card with the Clinton mention, so use your imagination. \n9 Dallas Mavericks (2001-present, alternate) \nThis looks like a horse in utero, photographed by a colorized sonogram. \"There, Mr. Cuban, look, right there! Those are the fingers that'll soon be shaking hands after playoff defeats.\" 8 New England Patriots (2000-present) \nDespite the silver-faced John Kerry, the Pats logo at least kept red, white and blue in the color scheme. And that's the only positive thing that can be said of the Flying Elvis design. Don't be fooled into thinking it's good just because the Patriots are. 7 Philadelphia Eagles (1996-present) \nYou know why newspapers put their lead story on the top right corner of the paper? It's because that's where people's eyes naturally look. That's why almost every logo goes from left to right. But Philadelphia and our next entry opted for the Hebrew style right-to-left, which is fine for a written text but not so much for a logo, as it makes it feel like it's going backward. And the fact that the Eagle is plummeting down is a metaphor all too familiar for Philly fans. 6 Washington Capitals (1997-2002) \nAt least this dive-bombing bird has his talons exposed, ready for battle. Why is this worse than the defenseless eagle? We'll explain when we get to another Washington team with an ill-advised logo transition. 5 Columbus Crew (1996-2014) \nWhat can I say about this that I didn't about the New Kids poster my sister had on her wall for way too long? Show this to 100 people and 95 would say this depicted a boy band that won a reality show hosted by Diddy. The other five would say it was the cover of an objectifying \"men at work\" calendar. (I like the smoldering one.) 4 Cincinnati Reds (1954-59, alternate) \nWhat happens when you play catch with a dog that has rabies? The baseball turns into this mustachioed ether aficionado. But the weirdest part isn't how the Reds had a mascot that clearly wanted to kill you - it's that he's actually a decapitated version of himself. The previous logo was this dude with a body. Then one day they just decided to lop off the body and just make him a disembodied head. 3 Washington Wizards (1997-2007) \nThe five worst parts of the old Washington Wizards logo, ranked. \n5. Remember that Capitals logo? It was changed in tandem with the Bullets/Wizards', going to a black and blue color scheme that have nothing to do with Washington except for the beat downs administered when good basketball teams play the Wizards or the Caps make the playoffs. \n4. The Wizard's beard helping form a W on his shirt. Cloak? Smock? \n3. A finger roll? Dude's a wizard and he decides the coolest way to score is by doing something George Gervin did better 20 years before? \n2. The crescent moon is a basketball and represents the sun setting on the Wizards season \n1. It's not the old Bullets hand logo. 2 New England Revolution (1996-present) \nThe only way this would be remotely acceptable is it was for a specific event - say, the 1994 Women's World Cup. Its continued existence seems like an oversight, like how Warner Bros. never took down the original Space Jam website, only this doesn't have the misplaced nostalgia that makes people think it's cool. The Les Miserables poster ! Yes. That's what it looks like, except that there was an actual revolution in that play, not an intended soccer revolution that didn't really pan out. 1 San Francisco 49ers (1991, unused) \nThe Chargers aren't the only California NFL team to have introduced a logo, heard the feedback and were all \"my bad\" a few days later. In 1991, at the height of Bill Walsh's dynasty, the 49ers inexplicably released the comically bad logo that looked nothing like the classic Niners logo of the present and instead looked like a logo for a small-town restaurant you'd see on a sign while driving down I-95. Fans flooded the switchboards of the team's headquarters (switchboards operated landline telephones, landline telephones were phones with cords) and after six days the Niners capitulated, ditching the logo and announcing that of all the feedback they'd received, only a single fan liked the logo. Probably was the dude who designed that Revolution logo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:38:41.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
