With Sunrisers Hyderabad winning the title in 2016, the city is scheduled to host the opening fixture of the 10th edition on April 5, preceded by an opening ceremony. They've also been allotted the final of the tournament, to be played on May 21. \nHowever, the failure of the cash-strapped board to disburse salaries has led over 120 employees, including groundsmen, to go on strike since the first week of March. According to reports, the seven home games of Sunrisers could be shifted to Raipur if the stalemate continues. \nHCA's argument in the mess has been that the BCCI has not disbursed funds to them, without which they are unable to pay their employees. A similar situation had come up right before the India-Bangladesh Test, held earlier in February. \nIn a Hyderabad High Court hearing on Monday (March 20), however, the BCCI counsel refuted that claim as the board's counsel Priyadarshan said that BCCI had released money to cricket bodies in various states but could not give it to HCA as they failed to furnish details of vendors. BCCI also conveyed to the HC, names of two retired judges, asking it to appoint them as administrators of the troubled cricket board. \n\"We are not asking the court to abolish the existing managing committee, but to bring in fiscal discipline,\" Priyadarshan said. The bench too agreed and said: \"How the money should be spent and how to prioritise it are areas that are better left to the administrators.\" \nThe shifting of matches away from Hyderabad will not be an unprecedented move. In IPL 2010, the Hyderabad side played in Mumbai and Nagpur, owing to the Telangana movement that had caused a lot of unrest in the city. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:15:54.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
