The demolition followed an earlier warning by Governor Yahaya Bello that landlords harbouring criminals or even unsure of the source of income of their tenants would have their houses demolished. This, he said, was in line with the provisions of the Anti Kidnapping, Robbery and Terrorism Law formulated by former governor Idris Wada. And in fulfillment of his threat, Bello on Wednesday stormed Okene in the Central Senatorial District of the state and supervised the demolition of a building used by suspected kidnappers, terrorists and armed robbers. The governor was accompanied by the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Wilson Inalegwu, and heads of other security agencies in the state for the exercise. The building of a suspected kidnap kingpin, Alhaji Tijani Bakare, was the first to be pulled down at Oyunkoko Ward in Okene LGA of the state. The enforcement team also demolished the Ahlul-Sunnah Mosque in Inike, Okene LGA. The mosque was reportedly hijacked in 2015 by members of the Boko Haram terrorist group, who turned it to their operational base. Speaking during the demolition, Bello vowed to implement the Anti-kidnapping, Robbery and Terrorism Law in the state to the letter. He added that more of such buildings would soon be pulled down to serve as a deterrent to other criminally-minded people. The governor warned people who were in the habit of harbouring criminals in their homes to repent or have their structures demolished. Also, Inalegwu said it would no longer be business as usual for criminal elements operating in any part of the state. “This is a strong message to kidnappers and hoodlums that they must change their ways. They should work hard and earn a decent living. “We want to make Kogi State safe so that living here or travelling through Kogi will not be with the fear of being kidnapped,” he said.
