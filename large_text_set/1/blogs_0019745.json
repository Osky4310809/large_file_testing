Lazar Markovic was signed for Liverpool by Brendan Rodgers Hull City are in talks to sign Liverpool's Serbia forward Lazar Markovic, who has been on loan at Sporting Lisbon since the summer. \nThe 22-year-old could move to the KC Stadium until the end of the season, but his season-long deal in Portugal would need to be ended first. \nLiverpool, Markovic and Sporting are in talks to terminate that agreement. \nMarkovic joined the Reds from Benfica for Â£20m in 2014 and played 34 times before a loan move to Fenerbahce. \nHe made 20 appearances for the Turkish club last season and has played 14 times for Sporting, scoring two goals. \nHull manager Marco Silva managed Estoril in Portugal during Markovic's one season with Benfica.
