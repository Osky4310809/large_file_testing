The launch is the largest simultaneous expansion for the ride-hailing company, second to its earlier kick-off in 40 U.S. cities announced in January, which is also when it first made clear that this would be the year it sought to grow to 100 new markets. \nLyft’s actually already getting very close to that target, and it’s only February. It now offers series in 94 new cities where it wasn’t present in 2016, and its total reach now spans 300 markets across the U.S. \nIf I’m doing the math correctly and Lyft only has to add 6 additional markets to complete its 2017 expansion goal, then that gives the company plenty of time to focus on other things for the year – like maybe launching autonomous service in a few initial markets in partnership with GM’s Cruise.
