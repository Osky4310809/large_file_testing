The 1917 house was designed by Leonard B Willeke for Josephine Clay, Eleanor Ford's sister. The garden was designed by Jens Jensen, who designed the grounds at the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House . We’ve covered this Indian Village home extensively in past sales, and it found a new owner last summer . It had been on and off the market for a while, finally selling for $660,000. It’s back on the market and hoping for an offer closer to earlier asking prices. It’s now listing for $735,000. First of all, this is a big house — 7,300 square feet — on a lot that goes all the way back to Seminole. The house has been maintained through the years (you can read an account of it here ) and it has the charm found in some grand old homes — Ice boxes in the kitchen, wood paneled studies, tiled fireplaces. But the house has modern amenities many would find attractive — a gorgeous master bathroom, a huge dressing room, a beautiful sun room. It has six bedrooms, three full and two half baths, and a big garage out back. Do you like wine? Dogs? You’re covered here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T09:24:17.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
