Maddie went underwater and her mom and stepdad weren’t unable to get her out of her seatbelt. It took the paramedics two minutes to show up. They were able to get her out. Jamie Lynn’s condition was listed as stable, but critical. With each new update, the situation was looking more bleak, but today, the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Department delivered some actual good news (remember what good news was?). They said in a statement given to People that Maddie has woken up and is breathing on her own.\n“With her father, mother and stepfather by her side, Maddie regained consciousness mid-day Tuesday, February 7. The 8-year-old daughter of entertainer Jamie Lynn Spears was involved in an ATV accident at a family home Sunday in Kentwood, La. Paramedics resuscitated her and she was airlifted to a local hospital. She is aware of her surroundings and recognizes those family members who have kept a round-the-clock vigil since the accident.\nDoctors were able to remove the ventilator today and she is awake and talking. Maddie continues to receive oxygen and is being monitored closely but it appears that she has not suffered any neurological consequences from the accident.”\nShortly after the shitty news about Maddie’s accident came out, Brit Brit asked her fans to pray for her niece. I’m sure Brit Brit herself spent many hours praying in front of her Cheeto Jesus. So everybody should take a quick break from yelling at Jamie Lynn about letting her 8-year-old drive an ATV and praise the power of Cheesus !\nPic : Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:16:50.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
