Dalupang (philstar.com)   9:23pm SMB's Chris Ross calls for a play during Game 3 of the PBA Finals series, Wednesday at the Smart-Araneta Coliseum. | PBA Media Bureau \nMANILA, Philippines – San Miguel Beer leaned on a fourth quarter rally to upend a well-oiled Barangay Ginebra side, 99-88, and take Game Three of the PBA Philippine Cup finals on Wednesday at the Smart-Araneta Coliseum. \nBeermen's June Mar Fajardo, Alex Cabagnot and Chris Ross sparked for 12 unanswered points in the final four minutes of the game to wrest the lead from the Kings. The run was capped off by the latter guard, who sank a triple with the game already far from Ginebra's reach. \n\"I thought we will lose again because they came out strong,\" SMB head coach Leo Austria told the press shortly after the game. \"At the third, nag-scramble ang offense and defense namin. But we were able to recover. [The players] believed in our system.” \nRoss emerged as the top scorer for the Beermen, while three-time MVP Fajardo again posted a dominant double-double in 17 points and 18 rebounds. \nGinebra drew production from LA Tenorio and Kevin Ferrer. But their combined 14 markers in the final period weren't enough to make up for the dry spell in as the game wound down. \n\"We liked the way we were playing. But down the stretch we didn't execute defensively or offensively,\" Kings tactician Tim Cone said.   \nCone, who engaged Ross in a verbal joust right after the game, declined to comment on their exchange. \nAccording to PBA's stats chief Fidel Mangonon III, 24 of 40 teams which won Game Three of the PBA Finals has a 60 percent winning rate of emerging as champions. \nThe scores: \nSAN MIGUEL 99 - Ross 24, Cabagnot 20, Fajardo 17, Lassiter 16, Santos 9, Tubid 6, Reyes 3, Heruela 2, Espinas 2, Garcia 0. \nGINEBRA 88 - Tenorio 16, Ferrer 15, Aguilar 12, Ellis 12, Caguioa 11, Thompson 8, Devance 6, Mercado 5, Marcelo 3, Helterbrand 0, Taha 0. \nQuarterscores: 19-24, 44-49, 69-66, 99-88.
