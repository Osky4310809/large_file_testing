The Big Game is almost here. Yes, we’re about a month away from the launch of the Nintendo Switch and its hotly anticipated launch title The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild . Oh, and I guess the Super Bowl is about to happen, too. But even if I don’t care about football, plenty of other folks do. And lots of eyeballs will be glued to TV screens this Sunday for Super Bowl LI. In-between all that ball-tossing will be the biggest commercials of the year, including this new ad for the Nintendo Switch.\nCheck it out!\nThis ad is actually Nintendo’s first Super Bowl ad ever. Considering most of its big product launches in the past have happened in the holiday season before the game, that’s not too surprising. Still, Nintendo’s been around for a long time, and the fact the company waited until now to debut a Super Bowl ad shows it wants to market the console/handheld hybrid to as wide an audience as possible.\nSuper Bowl viewers will see the 30-second version of the commercial but there is also an extended, 90-second version. The first commercial only shows off Zelda but the longer spot features launch window titles like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe , Splatoon 2 , 1-2 Switch , Arms , and Ultra Street Fighter II . Here you’ll also hear an even longer version of the brand new Imagine Dragons song “Believer.”\nIf you’re thinking Imagine Dragons and Nintendo are an odd combination, remember that the band played alongside Mario/Zelda composer Koji Kondo during the 2014 Game Awards.\nConsidering most pre-orders have already been sold out, someone who sees the Switch for the first time during the Super Bowl might not be able to get one on launch day. They’ll just have to settle for their team winning.\nWant to learn more?
