I don't buy italian bread , instead I use the cheap white bread and it is still soooo good! I also sometimes use shredded italian cheese blend instead of plain mozzarella.\" MY REVIEW Jan1vikequeen User ID: 8392385 227059 Reviewed May. 27, 2015 \n\"I can't wait to try this recipe but I have a question. Do I use miracle whip or real Mayo?\" MY REVIEW gunslinger User ID: 544392 223479 Reviewed Mar. 24, 2015 \n\"A good deliciously different grilled cheese. I think it would also be good to make it hardier by adding ham!\" MY REVIEW wefarm2live User ID: 2555499 74459 Reviewed Oct. 12, 2014 \n\"These were so delicious!

I just use a little less mayo.\" MY REVIEW tstreich User ID: 1042559 69179 Reviewed Nov. 21, 2013 \n\"This was too rich for my taste. The mayo overwhelmed the flavor and I guess that's not what I want to taste in a grilled cheese. Maybe reducing or using sour cream would be better. For as much filling as this made, I could have easily doubled the amount of bread . The sandwiches were so overstuffed, maybe it was the size of my loaf, but that could be another reason they seemed too rich for me. But I love the idea of cream cheese and multiple cheeses for a grilled cheese.\" MY REVIEW angieherzberger User ID: 5719645 74454 Reviewed Aug. 25, 2013 \n\"Sooo good! My whole family has loved it for years.\" MY REVIEW Motorhomegal User ID: 2005041 26536 Reviewed May. 16, 2013 \n\" ukfan, just a heads up....an 8 oz. package of shredded cheese is considered 2 cups volumewise, 8 oz. by weight. Check your package. I think this is were your confusion comes in. A cup of marshmallows wouldn't weigh NEARLY what a cup of molten steel would, but they would BOTH measure ONE CUP. \" ukfan1231 User ID: 7263722 76733 Reviewed May. 16, 2013 \n\"just a heads up...1 cup is 8oz, not 4oz. so do you use 1 cup or 4oz??\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T07:18:32.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
