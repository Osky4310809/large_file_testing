Otherwise, you are free to resign and tell him he is wrong.” \nHe said he had no particular Cabinet member in mind in making his appeal.   \nHe made the call in the course of discussing his proposal to reduce the age of criminal responsibility from 15 to nine years old. \n“I was still in college studying law, that was already nine years. Society has advanced tremendously since then in terms of discernment, so it should be brought back to nine years,” he said. \nLeftist Cabinet members, including Judy Taguiwalo of social welfare and development, are reportedly against lowering the age of criminal responsibility, which Duterte, like Alvarez, has advocated. \nAsked if he has discussed his call on Cabinet members with the President, the Speaker said he did not have to because that was only what he felt about how they should conduct themselves. \nHe reminded them that they would be made to account for their actions when they appear before lawmakers in the future to defend their agencies’ proposed budgets. \nDuterte has publicly criticized at least one Cabinet member, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade. \nThe President said he has not seen improvement in Metro Manila traffic, and in the lack of vehicle license plates and driver’s license.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:50:47.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
