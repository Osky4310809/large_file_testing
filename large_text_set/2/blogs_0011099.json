Because that's what I used to do and it really worked for a minute, back, a while ago,\" she said. \n\"I just don't feel comfortable talking about my personal life. Me and my boyfriend don't want to do that.\" \nWhile she doesn't want to discuss her new relationship, she wasn't shy about sharing an Instagram on Valentine's Day showing her and Bryan in a hot tub. \nAnd Bryan featured in her E! docuseries Mariah's world. https://www.instagram.com/p/BQhZeF5Dk34/embed \nMariah’s last romance with Australian billionaire businessman James, rarely left the headlines, from their engagement in January 2016 until their split in October \nShe went on to date backup dancer Bryan, who featured in her E! docuseries Mariah’s World. In one memorable scene, filmed while she was with James and before she started dating Bryan, he asked about her engagement. \nIn the final episode of Mariah's World, Bryan pulled Mariah to one side. \nAnd after asking her if she's going to marry James, he tells her he just wants her to be happy. \nBryan asks her: \"Are you really going to marry this guy?\" Mariah Carey is now dating dancer Bryan Tanaka (Photo: E!)
