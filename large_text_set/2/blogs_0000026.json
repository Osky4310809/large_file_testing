TheKnot.com \nAfter surveying about 13,000 couples who tied the knot back in 2016, results showed all the combined costs that went into their special day (like guests, entertainment and location) totaled an average of $35,329. \nAnd 2017 may see an even bigger number, considering the 2016 total was $3,000 more than the average in 2015. Giphy \nThe takeaway (kind of unsurprising) was that while the price of a wedding continues to grow to outlandish proportions, the number of guests actually invited is on a steady decline. \nWith the average number of guests currently at 141, happy couples are set on making their wedding a memorable experience for everyone involved. \nAnd apparently, that means going apeshit when it comes to in-house entertainment, with photo booths (78 percent), games (18 percent), musical performances (12 percent) and fireworks (8 percent) on the list of common wedding activities. TheKnot.com \nI guess everyone’s gotta do it for the Vine (RIP), or do it for the ‘gram, as I always say. \nAre you still gagging from the five-digit price tag I mentioned earlier? Just wait. \nIf you’re hoping to wed in rat-infested Manhattan (that I’m allowed to criticize because it is, in fact, my home), you better start saving your loose change pronto. \nCouples are reported to have spent around $78,464 on weddings in NYC, with price tags at $67,831 and $62,606 for locations in Long Island and north and central New Jersey, respectively. \nAnd that’s just for a few hours out of the day. \nI understand getting married is the cool thing to do nowadays, but who are these people trying to impress? I could go to so many happy hours with a load of cash that large. SMH. Giphy \nI hope they plan on sleeping in the basement of the venue, too. \nAs expected, wedding dresses on the East Coast also cost a pretty penny. Manhattan and Long Island brides are spending close to $3,000 on a gown. \nDo these people realize TLC is not filming them? “Say Yes to the Dress” is s 10 years ago. Give it a rest. \nBut I mean, I just spent $20 on my goddamn corner-deli breakfast the other day, so I guess you gotta do what you gotta do. \nWhoever my future husband may be ( I’m looking at you, Liam Hemsworth ), I’m going to want is to spend time with him. As long as things feel special for us, I’m good. \nI’m sure when you’re in the moment, the urge to splurge is much higher, but c’mon now, 64 percent of couples, did you really need to create a wedding hashtag? \nGet off your phones and just get fucking married. If you’re looking to budget, maybe try in Arkansas (where the average cost was $19,522) or at a McDonalds Play Place or something. \nSounds pretty lit to me.
