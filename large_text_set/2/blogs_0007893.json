Snake \n“[The] Euchambersia developed a deep and circular fossa, just behind its canine teeth in the upper jaw, in which a deadly venomous cocktail was produced, and delivered directly into the mouth through a fine network of bony grooves and canals,” the university said in a statement. \n“This is the first evidence of the oldest venomous vertebrate ever found,” said Julien Benoit from Witwatersrand. \n“More and more venom-producing mammals are discovered every year, including shrews and primates,” the university said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:25:37.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
