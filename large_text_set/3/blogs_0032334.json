I'm 10 and I go to Springfield Elementary. I'm Bart Simpson, put 'er there, man,\" offering her hand for a fist bump. (Photo: Spotted Cow Entertainment) \nJames is clearly very confused by the whole thing and politely tells her it's a \"really good impression\" which, obviously, Nancy finds hilarious. \n\"Is it pretty good? Do you know the guy that does it? Do you know who the voice is on that show?\" she asks him. \nJames replies: \"No, not really,\" so Nancy offers her hand and tells him to shake it - again, in her Bart voice - but he still doesn't quite clock what's happening. Nancy Cartwright as Bart (Photo: Splash / Channel4) \nNaturally, if he didn't know who voiced the characters he would have had no clue Bart's voice was actually created by a woman - and so the thought wouldn't have crossed his mind it could be the real thing. \nAfter a few seconds, the penny drops and James has the sweetest reaction ever. (Photo: Spotted Cow Entertainment) \nCarry on watching for Nancy's kind gesture for the boy, who she describes as \"so cute\". \nHe really does have the most adorable reaction.
