(Photo: ITV Picture Desk) \nAs Will struggled to pick between hopefuls, Tanya, Lia, Hayley, Clara, he wriggled around his chair as he tried to come up with an answer. \nGurning, grinning and grimacing, Will was pushed by host Emma to decide, as the minutes started to tick down on the live show's remaining air time. \nApparently having decided, he said : \"This is for the show and has nothing to do with how I feel about you as an artist.\" Read More Will.i.am had to make a TOUGH decision in The Voice knockout stage as his six acts became three Emma Willis was left hurrying him, seemingly exasperated by his indecision on Saturday (Photo: Rex Features) \nHowever, it seem he wasn't able to choose and he paused yet again, before trying to foist the decision on his fellow mentor, Jennifer Hudson. \n\"Hold on! I’m going to let Jennifer pick,\" he shouted, as the four girls looked on dismayed at his inability to put them out of their misery. \nBut as Emma and Jennifer object, and Emma seemingly almost lost her cool, he mumbled that he'd picked Tanya. Will struggled to pick his third and final act, and even tried to foist the decision onto Jennifer Hudson (Photo: Rex Features) \nAsked to repeat his decision, Will confirmed that he'd picked Tanya, and with only seconds to sapre a flustered Emma gathered Will's chosen for a VERY brief video outro. \nIt was certainly a dramatic way to end what had been a series of knock-out performances to decided his final three. \nJason and Michelle were saved in the public vote, but it was up to Will to save his third and final singer going into the final.

Tanya was spell-binding (Photo: Rex Features) \nJennifer Hudson was in agreement, as was Sir Tom Jones, who declared she'd given a \"professional performance\". \nNext up was Hayley Eccles, who was given I Need You Now by Lady Antebellum to perform. \nImproving with every outing, the hopeful was heaped with praise - though the mentors help back with heaps of praise. \n\"I love how she can take something and put her own direction into it,\" gushed Will following the song. Hayley's rendition of I Need You Now left some mentors wanting a little more (Photo: Rex Features) \nTom gave her some guidance following her effort, telling Hayley: \"You could get a little looser, you did really well though.\" \nLikewise, Gaven said: \"I hear what Tom is saying. I think the audience really helped you.\" \nThough he added encouragingly: \"every time you keep getting better and better.\" \nJason Jones, Will's only male act left, was next up on the stage, and gave Arian Grande's Into You his very own spin. Jason blew all four mentors away (Photo: Rex Features) \nBlown away by the song, Will exclaimed: \"You’re voice is so incredible. if i had a voice like yours i would sing with no shirt on.\" \nAnd an admiring Tom said Jason had only got \"stronger\", while Jennifer praised him for his \"own unique smoothness\". \nFollowing the glowing praise, Jason himself said: \"That was the best feeling.\" \nLia White performed Cyndi Lauper's Girls Just Want To Have Fun, putting an acoustic spin on the '80s classic. Lia White was unsure about her stunning cover of Girls Just Want To Have Fun (Photo: Rex Features) \nAfter being initially unsure about Will's pick, she was heaped with praise - with Jennifer in particular giving her huge kudos. \nShe said: \"You are so adorable. you remind me of Solange [Knowles], and I don’t know if you know who Aliyah is, but you remind me of her.\" \nAnd Gavin was an equally big fan, simply stating: \"It’s been done to death, and you were really smart to do it your own way. In the short time you were on stage you went from super intimate to busting wicked moves.\" Clara Hurtado gave a sizzling performance, owning the stage with Alarm by Anne Marie (Photo: Rex Features) \nClara Hurtado gave a stand-out performance with Alarm by Anne Marie, but it wasn't just her voice wowing - as her stage presence bowled the judges over. \n\"That dress and the way you sang that, that is fire,\" panted Will after the exhilarating number. \nEven host Emma Willis was unable to hide her admiration either, as she chirped\" she’s so hot. \nGavin added that \"she is the entire package\", before adding: \"You look incredible, you sound great… it’s just so special. Will is right, the red dress is special.\" Despite battling against illness, Michelle managed to deliver a powerhouse act (Photo: Rex Features) \n\"I think it’s all been said. I loved it,\" gushed Tom. In response a humble Clara said: \"I was so nervous, so im glad that i powered through it.\" \nMichelle was the last act up, singing Bonnie Ray's I Can't Make You Love Me, but was nervous as a bad throat had been plaguing her all week. \nShe needn't have worried though as she received a standing ovation from the audience. \nTom declared that he \"really loved\" the song, while Gavin said: \"You’ve got this split personality. You have this tension when you come to rehearsals. You should know that when you come through- for you, your voice is extraordinary.\" \nWhile will told her: \"That performance felt like a lifetime of what people should be seeing.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T02:35:12.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
