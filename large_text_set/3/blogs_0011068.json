In particular, he sees a big opportunity to plug customer data platforms into the systems that actually manage email marketing campaigns — like Campaign Monitor.

At the same time, he said Campaign Monitor customers will still be able to work with other data platforms: “For us, whatever data our customers want to use, and wherever that data lives, we want to be able to bring that data into Campaign Monitor.” \nThe financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Bard said the Tagga team will be joining Campaign Monitor and will continue to work out of their office in Toronto.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:26:47.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
