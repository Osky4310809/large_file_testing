It's definitely a love-it-or-hate-it style of headphone. I've never been a fan, and while I'm not a convert, these headphones did surprise me.\nThey sound great. Especially for a small, compact pair of headphones. Whether I was getting through my audiobook queue, listening to Indie Rock, Classic Rock, or Jazz, the BTS Pro's presented the music accurately and without heavy compression or distortion.\nThese headphones also stay put. They're meant for athletes, and while I'm not the most physically active person in the world, they didn't wobble at all during my commute or when walking around the city. If you're a runner who dislikes earbuds and doesn't want to compromise on audio quality, meet your new headphones.\nAs is the case with many products, these headphones are also \"smart\" and can be used in conjunction with an app, called Motion Control. It has a bunch of useful information, but to be honest, I didn't use it much. It can tell you how much battery the BTS Pro has and it lets you adjust the EQ â€” there are presets, but you can manually adjust this.\nThe app's two useful features are giving you a detailed list of actions that can be performed by each of the BTS Pro's on-earcup audio controls, and a GPS feature which locates your headphones. The latter is particularly useful because it can show you a Google map on their last known location, and can send a chime to the headphones if they're connected and in range.\nOverall, there's a lot to like about these headphones, but there are a couple of caveats I noticed during my testing. The first is that the part of the headband that fits around your ear could use a light layer of padding; it's hard plastic that did get a little irritating during longer listening sessions.\nAmazon\nThe second is that these headphones disconnect very quickly when audio isn't being played. Almost all Bluetooth headphones turn off eventually to save power, but the BTS Pro is very stingy in this regard, turning off in only a few seconds. Once off, there where times where they refused to turn on for a couple of minutes.\nThe Music Connect app I mentioned earlier shows that these headphones can receive firmware updates. I'd suggest including a \"time to turn off\" setting be included in a future update.\nAs I mentioned earlier, these are an excellent pair of Bluetooth headphones for athletes, or people who've been using behind-the-back style headphones for years. They're definitely easier to recommend in their Bluetooth form than their wired counterparts. If you're active, and want headphones that are smarter than most, all the better.\n66 Audio BTS Pro Bluetooth Headphones, $129.99, available at Amazon\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
