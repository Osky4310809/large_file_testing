It was Nintendo's fastest-selling console in Europe , after all. \nNintendo claimed that since this \"manufacturing variation\" only affects a \"small number\" of units, that \"there is no design issue with the Joy-Con controllers.\" \nAs such, Nintendo said that \"no widespread proactive repair or replacement effort is underway.\" \nIf you're affected by this problem, Nintendo urges you to reach out to customer support to determine if it's a hardware issue. After all, it could be caused by aquarium interference . \nBut if it is determined that your controller is faulty, Nintendo will fix it. \"Consumers can send their controller directly to Nintendo for the adjustment, free of charge, with an anticipated quick return of less than a week,\" the hardware manufacturer stated. \n\"We have determined a simple fix can be made to any affected Joy-Con to improve connectivity,\" Nintendo said. According to CNET , that fix is none other than a smidge of foam.   Jeffrey Matulef \nJeffrey Matulef is the best-dressed man in 1984.
