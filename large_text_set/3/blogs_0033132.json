She totally put him on blast too with some whithering text. via Imgur Case closed, right? No way Peter can come back from that. WRONG. via Imgur Damn, son! Okay, so let’s recap. Girl cheats on boy. Boy catches girl. Girl begs boy to let her stay at his apartment. Boy has mercy and says okay for now. Girl tries to seduce him back into a relationship and then, when that doesn’t work, tries to get sympathy claiming she’s being cheated on but gets busted publicly. I don’t know that I’ve seen anyone play themselves this badly and this publicly. Bye, Patricia.
