It was an easy choice. \n\"Both parties were very happy and they wanted to give me a sign that they are satisfied with what I've done there. \n\"Much has been written [about Manchester United] but it's nothing I have focused on. I have always focused on what was important to me and that's the team [Benfica]. That [the rumours], makes no difference to me.\" \n\"As I've said I've been thriving at Benfica and that's where the focus has been. A lot has been written and I've said nothing, I've been focused.\" \nNeymar drops huge Man Utd hint \nQuestioned on whether a summer departure could be on the cards, Lindelof said: \"I have a long contract at Benfica and I'm thriving there. It's a big club and I'm developing every day. I'm only 22 years old and there is no stress [to push through a move].\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:55:39.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
