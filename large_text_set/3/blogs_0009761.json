However, I truly believe that a US immigration system that addresses the needs of the undocumented Irish, and provides for future legal flows, will be of huge benefit to America,\" he said. \nThe Friendly Sons of St Patrick is Americaâ€™s oldest Irish society but until this year was exclusively for men. \nHowever to mark its 245th anniversary in March the Philadelphia chapter has inducted Irish Ambassador to the US Anne Anderson as the first honorary female member. \nMr Kenny described the move as a \"just and courageous step forward\". \n\"I was delighted last year that your pioneering Irish American spirit and commitment to equality lead you to the historic decision to admit women members. I salute that decision,\" Mr Kenny say. \nHe added that Ms Anderson's record of service is \"stellar\". \nThe Taoiseach will attend the St Patrick's Day parade in Philadelphia today before moving to Boston.
