PUBLISHED: 15:35, Wed, Mar 22, 2017 | UPDATED: 15:48, Wed, Mar 22, 2017 EbS Michel Barnier said the EU will prioritise a trade deal with Britain \nThe French politician said that it was in the EU's best interests to secure the closest possible political ties in an extraordinarily conciliatory speech which was by some margin the most detailed that any senior Brussels figure has given on Brexit. \nHe told the EU's committee of the regions that he disagreed with Theresa May's assertion that \"no deal is better than a good deal\" saying a failure to secure a future economic pact would be disastrous for both sides. \nHe said: \"A lack of an agreement, a no deal scenario, this isn’t what we want. We want an agreement, we want to be successful, and we’re not just against the British but together with the British. \n\"That’s why speaking on behalf of the 27 member states I can say we want to reach an agreement on an ordered departure of the UK and lay the ground for a new partnership we will build togetrher with them. \n\"It’s not too early to sketch out its parameters. At the heart of that partnership there will be a free trade agreement that we will negotiate on in due course. That free trade agreement will be sui generis, it will be unlike any existing one so we need to prepare for that. \n\"We agree with Theresa May when in her recent speech she talked of a bold and ambitious free trade agreement. Yes indeed we can share ambition. \n\"There is no precedent in European history for such a free trade agreement.\" \nMr Barnier also insisted that there is no attempt to \"punish\" Britain for leaving the club, but said he will hit Britain with a £50 billion exit bill because it had to honour commitments it had already made. \nHe said: \"Each country must honour its commitments towards the others. When a country leaves the union there is no punishment, there is no price to pay to leave. \n\"But we must settle the accounts - no more, no less. We will not ask the British to pay a single euro for something they have not agreed to as a member.\" \nMore to follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:56:13.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
