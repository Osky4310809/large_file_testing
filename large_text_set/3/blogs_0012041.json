USC advances out of Dayton to meet No. 6 seed SMU in Tulsa in the round of 64.\nBennie Boatwright led all the night’s scorers with 24 points, and he added seven rebounds besides.\nCooley couldn’t last but a minute before needing a timeout to regroup his team and calm them down. After all, USC had stolen two straight possessions from the Friars and sunk a runner off a breakaway and then a three pointer to jump out to a 5-0 lead. The discussion helped, but only temporarily, as USC’s Bennie Boatwright caught fire from beyond the arc. By the first media timeout he had 10 points and was a perfect 2-of-2 from out in the yard.\nNot to be outdone, Providence guard Jalen Lindsey also rushed out to four quick three pointers, and by halfway through the first half, Providence had tightened the night’s proceedings up to just an 20-18 advantage for the Trojans.\nFrom there, the Friars took off, opening up a 9-0 run to take a 24-20 lead with seven minutes left in the half. Out of the under-8 media timeout, Lindsey was fouled on a three point attempt, hit all three, then teammate Rodney Bullock added a three of his own to extend the Friars’ lead out to 30-20. That flurry came in the service of a 15-0 run over the preceding four minutes. With two minutes to go it was a 26-6 beatdown, and USC could not find an answer.\nProvidence thus held a convincing advantage at halftime, 44-29, but that was not to last out the final buzzer.\nUSC’s cold streak continued into the second half’s opening minutes, failing to score a basket until the 17-minute mark. Still, the Trojans remained unfazed by the deficit, having come back from double-digit deficits 11 times this season, the most in the NCAA. They soon pulled to within nine at the 12-minute timeout, aided largely by Boatwright on both ends of the floor.\nThe Trojans’ push continued for the next ten minutes, with Nick Rakocevic taking off for a handful of buckets, and soon enough the score was 55-50 Friars with 10 minutes left to play. Emmitt Holt picked up his fourth foul with 7:45 to go, and the Trojans were back on top, 61-60. A 17-point deficit entirely erased in the space of 14 minutes.\nFor as hard as Cooley’s men fought, and considering how long they led only to fail out for their fourth-straight Big Dance surely smarts for the Friars. And if you’re USC, you avenged last year’s first-round heartbreak. Now, the Trojans get No. 6 SMU in Tulsa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T05:38:34.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
