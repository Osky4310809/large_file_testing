I handle the news around here. Posted 15 hours ago 5 \nSkrillex has officially reunited with his old post-hardcore band From First to Last on their latest single track \"Make War.\" \nThe announcement comes after a series of hints and rumors, including the latest photo of Skrillex and FFTL's Matt Good in the studio with Blink-182 guys. \nAs you may or may not know, Skrillex was a member of the gang between 2004 and 2007. During that period, he sang on two of the band's studio efforts - 2004's \"Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count\" and 2006's \"Heroine.\" \nWhether this is a one-off thing or something more remains to be seen.
