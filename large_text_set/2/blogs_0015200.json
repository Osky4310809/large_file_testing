It clocks in at $69.99, so it’s definitely reserved for gamers with a little extra scratch to spare.\nLike the Wii U’s Pro Controller, though, it also boasts a really strong battery life. The back of the box, as revealed by GameXplain in their recent vid and spotted by NeoGAF user Vic , reveals that the lithium ion battery within the controller lasts about 40 hours on a single charge. The Wii U Pro Controller, for reference, lasted me somewhere between 70 and 80 hours per charge.\nCompare that to the other rechargeable controller on the console market, the DualShock 4?
