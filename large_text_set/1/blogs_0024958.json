She just makes it seem like a pleasant place, is very professional, and left me feeling like my teeth hadn't been cleaner in years. Her new office on 57th Street isn't fussy but is packed with state-of-the-art equipment that just made everything easy. I especially liked the digital x-rays. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a trustworthy dentist who is experienced but also up to date.
