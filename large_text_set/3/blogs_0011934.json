A month later, Christina found out she was pregnant, and he screamed and demanded she keep the child a secret.”\nChristina Sanchez Liyah was born in May 2009, and, according to Christina, Reyes did provide “a small amount” of child support until 2015.\nThe next year, Christina blasted him on Twitter, “You’re a worthless piece of s - - t father to our child . . . Liyah just asked about you again & I had to explain to her that it’s a cruel world we live in. You are a cruel man !!!” Gildin said, “All Christina wants is for José to be a dad to their daughter. She has been pleading with José to be in touch. The child misses her father. She can only see him by watching him play baseball on TV.”\nHe added if Reyes — who earns $22 million a year — doesn’t make an offer for child support, and assume his role as a father, they’ll sue for $5 million a year.\nReyes’ attorney Eric S. Solotoff said, “We . . . are confident that when all of the evidence comes out, it will show that our client has more than met his obligations. It is unfortunate that the other side has chosen to deal with this in this manner.”\n  WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:09:00.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
