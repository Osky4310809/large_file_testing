Some are highlighting the benefits ACA has had on our country, including the financial advantages. Health care prices have risen at the lowest rate in 50 years since the Affordable Care Act became law. #OurFirstStand \n— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 15, 2017 Some say without the ACA, they would not have made it through their personal health struggles and that “the ACA saved my life.” \"I was 26 When I was diagnosed w/ Cancer.

We are one of the very few developed nations in the entire world that does not guarantee health care to all our citizens. #OurFirstStand \n— Rep. Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) January 15, 2017 \nThis point was a large part of Senator Bernie Sanders’ platform when he was running for the Democratic nomination in 2016. Some say this is a surefire way to put citizens’ health in jeopardy. Don't be fooled. No matter how you slice it, GOP's plan to repeal & replace is a scam that will #MakeAmericaSickAgain https://t.co/kybYS6Opn9 \n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) January 10, 2017 Some say it is time for everyone to have the rights they deserve. Health care should not be a privilege for the wealthy. Health care is a human right. Today we defend that right. #OurFirstStand \n— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 15, 2017 \nIn an event spearheaded largely by Senator Bernie Sanders and other Democrats across the country, like Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, people have come together to ensure that the health care afforded to Americans since the passing of ACA isn’t completely repealed. \nIn late 2016, Sanders, Pelosi and Schumer released a statement on Bernie Sanders’ website about “Our First Stand” and why people need to speak up. It reads, \nBeginning in January, it is likely that Republican leaders in Congress will follow through on their threats to ram a budget bill that will severely undermine the health care needs of the American people. \nMillions of Americans voted for Donald Trump after he promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. He must be held to his promises and should veto any legislation which cuts these vital and necessary health programs. \nOnly time will tell what the future has in store for our country’s health care system. \nWe cannot argue this week marks the beginning of a scary time in our nation’s history. Here’s to hoping everyone gets the rights they are entitled to , even under a Trump administration. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
