I hope the three can control the situation in those eight matches. \n\"I will try to rest one in every game. On Saturday I will rest one, against Hull another - and we’ll try to make a rotation between these three. \n\"We still have Daley Blind as the fourth defender in case we need him to play there and we also have Michael Carrick, so let’s try.\" \nMourinho also confirmed that Morgan Schneiderlin and Memphis Depay will not be considered for selection until their respective futures are resolved. \nThe Portuguese revealed the midfield duo looked certain to leave the club in December but now have no imminent moves on the table. \n\"I will allow them to leave if the right offer comes,\" Mourinho explained. \"Until this moment? No. \nMan City go from crisis to cruise control \n\"Is this a good situation? No. Why not? Because I don’t think about them as options in this moment. \n\"In normal conditions they would probably be selected for the match tomorrow and they aren’t because we're waiting for something that a couple of weeks ago looked like 100 per cent and at the moment looks like zero per cent, because we don’t have any offer that is close to the quality for the players we have.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:41:52.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
