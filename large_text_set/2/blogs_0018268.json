The final version of the policy covers illegals in the interior of the US, giving agents broad latitude to detain those suspected of being in the country illegally.\nWashington Times:\nHomeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly officially ordered federal agents this week to begin arresting and deporting more illegal immigrants, releasing them from the handcuffs the Obama administration had imposed, and making headway on one of President Trump’s chief campaign promises.\nWhile young adult illegal immigrant “Dreamers” are still exempted, agents were told there are no longer any other special classes of people that should be considered off limits for deportation.\nThose caught at the border are to be swiftly shipped back, Mr. Kelly said, and he freed agents to target a broader universe of illegal immigrants for deportation from within the interior of the U.S. The secretary said agents are still to give priority to those with criminal rap sheets, but are free to use discretion — taken away from them in the Obama years — to detain anyone they believe to be in the country illegally.\n“It is not intended to produce mass roundups,” a Homeland Security official said, briefing reporters on two new memos Mr. Kelly signed Monday.\nThe memos set the groundwork for building a wall and call for hiring 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and 500 more officers for the Air and Marine operations at Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Funding those priorities will depend on Congress.\nSecretary Kelly also said local police who want to help enforce immigration laws will be welcomed, rather than rebuffed, as they were under the Obama administration.\nDrafts of the memos had leaked in recent days, sparking feverish outcry from immigrant-rights groups who said they were a major step back in respecting illegal immigrants.\nOn Capitol Hill, Democrats vowed scrutiny and resistance.\n“We need an immediate public examination in Congress of these heavy-handed, anti-family policies,” said Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat. “The Senate should also pass the bill I’ve sponsored to repeal the mass deportation order. The Republican-controlled Congress has an urgent responsibility to do its constitutional duty and act as an independent check on President Trump.”\nThe two memos are watered down slightly compared to draft versions that leaked last week. Rather than being instructed they “should” arrest most illegal immigrants, as they were in an earlier version, agents are now told they “may” arrest anyone they deem a priority.\nDHS stressed that nothing was going to change immediately. The agencies have to figure out how to turn these policies into action without running afoul of laws already on the books. For instance, local police are limited in who they can stop on suspicion of being in the country illegally. Also, if an illegal at the border asks for asylum, it isn't clear under what circumstances they can be sent back across the border to wait for a hearing.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/21/dhs-orders-breathtaking-crackdown-on-illegal-immigration/\nload more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:47:54.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
