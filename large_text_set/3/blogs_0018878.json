Aitor Karanka parted company with Middlesbrough on Thursday, leaving the club in 19th place, three points from safety, with the league's lowest number of wins (four) and goals scored (19). A defensive record bettered only by Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea might have reflected more kindly were it not for the fact that 'Boro have been turgid to watch as a result. \nTheir slide down the table during a 10-game win-less run has coincided with a flicker of life in the teams who surround them, surges precipitated in each case by a change in the dugout. 'Boro became the fifth of the bottom six clubs to do just that but with just 11 games remaining, they will need the reaction they are praying for to be an immediate one, starting with the visit of Manchester United on Sunday. \nRelegation fights always yield casualties and though it does me no credit, such battles are something I know a fair bit about. I was relegated three times during my career in the Football League and on a further two occasions, my team survived on a frenzied final day of the season. I saw four managers lose their jobs during those struggles and it will come as little surprise to hear that it is never a pleasant environment to be in. \nDealing with defeat, with failure, is the hardest thing in football. Not just finding a way to change your fortunes on the pitch, but maintaining a harmonious environment and unity off it. In my experience, the former rarely arrives without the latter. Middlesbrough have finally decided to change managers but have they left it too late? \nThose still crying foul over Leicester City's dismissal of Claudio Ranieri despite their subsequent rejuvenation fail to comprehend that, rather than calmly attempting to redirect a ship veering off its course, Ranieri banished his crew, locked himself in the control room, span the wheel and very nearly capsized the ship. \nThe pressure that comes with failure is very different to that of the stresses in pursuit of success. A cup final or a race for a league title (I did win on the odd occasion, honest!) brings pressure that thrills and exhilarates; battling to avoid the drop feels sticky and claustrophobic, laden with consequence. \nHow you deal with that pressure will determine your fate. As a player, when the whistle blows on a Saturday, adrenaline washes away much of those inhibitions but the remnants are there in your mind. Managers often go through the same 90 minutes feeling a sense of helplessness instead. Failure becomes a burden whose weight becomes greater with every defeat. It can be painful to watch a manager agonise week after week over what he can do or change to halt the pattern of decline. \nAs passions flow, tempers often fray. I've seen plenty of rows and scraps: on one occasion it took four players to restrain a teammate whose commitment had been questioned after a heavy loss, such was his stature and state of distress! But afterwards you have to dust yourself down and focus on the next game, and do this together . \nWhen grudges are held and animosity festers, the atmosphere can become acrid and morose within a club, which is why reports of disharmony in the Middlesbrough dressing room are not surprising. Karanka's ultra-conservative approach to games has been questioned both in and out of the dressing room. There was a recent training ground bust-up with Stewart Downing and a similar episode this time last season saw Karanka placed on gardening leave, before being reinstated and leading 'Boro to the Premier League. \nKaranka is no shrinking violet and the pressure can sometimes get the better of you. His pointed remarks about the restless Riverside supporters back in January, who wanted to see a flicker of that vigour and attacking purpose shown toward their team's opponents, was another sign of the cracks beginning to appear. \nSometimes when the path becomes so familiar with little sign of a change in fortune, a change in the dugout becomes the only option. 'Boro need look no further than Leicester to see what can happen when the cloud that has enveloped your team is suddenly lifted. Aitor Karanka tried everything to keep 'Boro afloat but in the end, his conservative approach alienated him. \nYou may ask what changes to give rise to such an upturn, so quickly and so often? Imagine your boss made going to work every day something you looked forward to like a trip to the dentist; perhaps you do? Then imagine, suddenly, he was gone. You would have a spring in your step, a brighter outlook and in football those human instincts are no different. It doesn't last forever but it refreshes and along with new ideas, it revitalises too. That is not to say you might not hold the former manager in high regard or respect him -- like him as a person, even. But as cruel as it sounds, the atmosphere often changes in a heartbeat when they leave. \nThe incumbent always makes a point of saying what has gone before is forgotten. One January, I joined a club six points from safety shortly after a new manager had been appointed. He was upbeat and positive. He made sure we were well-prepared and organised, squashed any blame for past failures and focussed everyone, together, on the target: survival . We did survive, too. \nSam Allardyce has done the same thing time and again with the same basic tenets. He started slowly at Crystal Palace but you would always bet on his team to be above the red line come the end of the season. \nPaul Clement and Marco Silva have injected a new-found vigour to Swansea City and Hull City, giving them new direction and results have improved as a result. Sunderland under David Moyes, meanwhile, have been in the bottom three for all but two weeks of the season. They are the only club who have elected to stick rather than twist and his hope that \"our good run is yet to come\" hardly fills you with optimism. \nTime is running out. But to stay up, against the odds, can feel like winning a trophy. In this case, Premier League survival, and all the riches it bestows, is the prize. \nGregor is a former professional footballer who played over 300 games in the English Football League.
