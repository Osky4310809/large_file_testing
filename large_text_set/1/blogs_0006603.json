It was an impressive statue that many from Japan and around the world flocked to see. Not to be outdone, the Chinese created their own life-sized statue of another famous anime mech: Evangelion’s EVA Unit-01. The statue is so large that it has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records.\nThis statue was actually built last summer and revealed at the ChinaJoy gaming expo but was torn down and reassembled elsewhere on Tuesday. The original construction (created by Chinese mobile game developer, Heitao) had the mech’s weapon, the Spear of Longinus, on the ground next to it. The reconstructed version has Unit-01 holding the spear upright.\nこういうことだそうです https://t.co/2s8IEZ5udF pic.twitter.com/kDMUWLv3rw \n— 中国住み (@livein_china) January 4, 2017 \n\nThe spear is what helps this statue set a world record. With no spear, the statue is roughly 13 meters tall. With the spear in hand, it shoots up to 24.8 meters in height. If you think that is cheating, consider that antenna and other extensions are taken into account for tallest buildings in the world competitions.\nThe Unit-01 statue got the award in the category of world’s tallest Evangelion statue. Considering it is currently the only Evangelion statue on Earth, this seems unfair, but it’s probably a safe bet to assume others may try to outdo the size of this statue in the future. The actual award (which you can see below) lists Studio Khara as the statue’s owner, with cooperation from the China Shanghai Character License Administrative Corporation.\nThis statue is certainly an impressive feat. You can tell that a lot of love went into its creation since it looks like it jumped straight out of the anime. Hopefully, this will set off a sort of arms race between folks who want to build more of these giant mech statues. Personally, I want to see someone recreate Gurren Laggann — though it’ll have to be the mech in its first form… not the one that is 10 million light years tall.\nView as: One Page Slides 1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T04:19:42.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
