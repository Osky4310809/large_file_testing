Of these, the 14-inch ThinkPad X1 Yoga stands head and shoulders above the rest, because it combines light weight with solid battery life and a gorgeous display that can show over 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut. \nProfessional 3D modelers may want the P40 Yoga, which has Nvidia Quadro graphics but suffers from below-average battery life and plenty of fan noise. All of the ThinkPad Yogas come with very accurate styluses. \nIf you prefer a detachable design, go for the X1 Tablet, which comes with a removable keyboard and provides a gorgeous display, along with a thicker stylus than on Lenovo's bendback hybirds. However, unless you get its extended battery attachment, the tablet has just five and a half hours of battery life. Best Keyboards \nEven the worst ThinkPad keyboard is pretty good, but they aren't all created equal, as some have more travel and a better feel than others. The very affordable ThinkPad 13 has the best combination of deep travel and strong feedback of any laptop we've tested, though it doesn't have a backlight. \nThe T460 has really deep travel and a snappy feel also while the X1 Carbon offers a great response, even though its keys are a little shallower than the T series, P series and ThinkPad 13 lines. It's important to note that there are sometimes subtle manufacturing differences, even within the same product line. One T460s we tested felt a little mushy but two other units had pleasantly-strong feedback. Best Screen \nMany of Lenovo's ThinkPads are available with different screen options, allowing you to choose a resolution or decide between touch and non-touch panels. We strongly recommend that you get your ThinkPad with a minimum resolution of 1920 x 1080 and eschew the ugly 1366 x 768 and 1600 x 900 panels that come on a few of the base configs. To get the best battery life, eschew a touch screen if you're buying a traditional clamshell laptop rather than a 2-in-1. \nThe ThinkPad X1 series (X1 Carbon, X1 Yoga and X1 tablet), all have great color quality, with the ability to reproduce over 100 percent of the sRGB gamut. The pricey P50 and P70 have vibrant displays with optional 4K resolutions and color calibrators. Best Value \nThe ThinkPad 13 is a steal, starting at under $600 with two premium features, a 1080p screen and an SSD on board. Lenovo's small-business focsed ThinkPad E460 and E560 start at just $521, with very-basic components but you can configure them with SSDs, 1080p displays and Core i5 CPUs for a little over $200 more. \nDepending on how you configure them, the ThinkPad T460 and X260 give you good bang for the buck, with starting prices around (or sometimes below) $700, though prices creep closer to $1,000 when you configure them with 1080p screens, Core i5 CPUs and SSDs. Most Powerful \nMost mainstream ThinkPads come with a choice of low-voltage, dual-core Intel Core i3, Core i5 or Core i7 CPUs. If you want a lot more speed for tasks like 3D modeling, CAD or engineering work, get one of the P series laptops. If you want the most powerful mobile workstation around and size is no object, get the 17-inch ThinkPad P70 , which is available with an Intel Xeon E3-1505M CPU and Nvidia Quadro M5000M graphics. The P50 offers the same Xeon CPU but a slightly-slower Nvidia Quadro M2000M GPU. \nIf you want some more performance out of a mainstream, non-workstation-class laptop, consider the ThinkPad T460p which comes with mobile quad-core, H-class Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs. Several ThinkPads, including the X1 Carbon, T460s and P50 / P70 are available with a NVMe-PCIe SSDs, which provide three times the performance of a standard, SATA SSD. âœ–", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T06:39:03.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
