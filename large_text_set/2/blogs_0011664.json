He did it all his career at Liverpool, and he had another quality career and I think he's a great man. Steven Gerrard and Carroll head off to an England training session in 2012 (Photo: PA) \n\"He was fantastic for England and Liverpool and just a great career.\" \nCarroll joined Liverpool for a club-record £35m from Newcastle in January 2011 - the same week Suarez signed from Ajax for around £23m, and the tall frontman talked up his former strike-partner's attributes. \n\"His work-rate, his movement and his finishing was fantastic,\" said Carroll. \n\"He was just a great player and obviously that's why he got his move to Barcelona [in 2014].\" \nCarroll joined West Ham from the Reds on a permanent deal for around £15m in the summer of 2013 after a successful year on loan with the Londoners.
