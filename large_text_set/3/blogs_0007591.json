Me? I could really use about five grand for courtside Knicks tickets, but let’s be real, I need a miracle for that to happen. Someone else who needs five grand, and actually tried to make it happen, is mom-of-two Nikki Smith from Bristol, England. Nikki wanted to reward her two daughters for their good behavior by taking them to Disney World in Florida, so she started a GoFundMe page to raise £5,000 ($6,100) for the dream vacation. The problem is, she got absolutely destroyed by the internet. Facebook We’re talking mercilessly ripped apart. And not only that, but in total, she only raised an embarrassing £10 ($12) before she decided to shut down the page. She also got a tidal wave of abuse. One woman told her, Taking the absolute piss. There are plenty of families who struggle with money that save for holidays regardless of how long it takes. Absolute chancer. And another said, This just ruins the actual purpose of the page, there should be an admin who monitors it. Facebook Her appeal was shared 18,000 times on Facebook — but it wasn’t shared by people happily willing to donate. \nAll in all, it was a pretty rough time for Nikki, 33, who told Sun Online , \nIt’s so hard to save with two children as well as working part time, you’ve got the bills and shopping – it would probably take me ten years to save up that much and it would be too late then. It’s a wish list on the GoFundMe page – people can save up to travel around the world and everything, there are different funding ideas in there. I just thought it would be the only way it would ever happen. REX/Shutterstock She has since resurrected the fundraising page and updated it to read, I thought this section of the website was for funding hopes, dreams and wishes, and I believed GoFundMe was a chance to raise money for anything. I looked in the category and a lot of people were doing similar things, even raising money for breast enhancements and cars. I never meant to upset anyone. I’m traumatized by the abuse and negativity I have received. If anyone reading this has a spare five grand in their pockets, please consider giving it to me. Like, I really, really want courtside Knicks tickets. But I can’t afford it because I keep spending my money on booze, food and disappointing cups of tea . Venmo would be ideal. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
