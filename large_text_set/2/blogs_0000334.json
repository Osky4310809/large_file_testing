For the first big update of 2017, the company is adding a new curves tool to version 2.15 of Snapseed, among other things.\nSee also: Best Photo Editor Apps for Android 4 weeks ago \n \nMany PC photo editors have curves tools of their own, so it’s great to see something like that make an appearance on a mobile editor like Snapseed. As you can see in the screenshot above, the tool puts a straight, diagonal line on an image. Moving that line around can change a photo’s brightness level and colors to alter its overall tone with more precision. The tool in Snapseed offers up some presets that are designed as a guide for the more advanced photo editor to use Curves.\nIn addition, Snapseed’s Face filter now allows you to “ask” it to try harder if it has issues detecting a face (we assume if you ask nicely, you get better results). The Text tool has also been updated to let you choose where to wrap lines in all multiline styles. Finally, the grain quality in Black and White mode has also been improved in version 2.15.\nAll in all, this seems like a solid update for Snapseed, and we suspect the curves tool will be used a lot by more advanced editors. Be aware that the update is still rolling out so it may take a little while to reach your device.\nGet it at Google Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:52:16.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
