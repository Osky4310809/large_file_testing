Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images View more sharing options Close   00.05 GMT \nP resident Donald Trump’s hastily called press conference on Thursday struck many of those watching, in the US and around the world, as bizarre, even surreal. The president mounted a hyperbolic, rambling, fact-challenged defence of his administration and condemned the media as dishonest purveyors of “fake news”. At one point, he insisted: “I’m not ranting and raving”, a backhanded acknowledgement that many viewers would indeed think he was doing precisely that. \nTo Trump’s critics, the extraordinary performance was deeply unpresidential. Where was the sense of gravitas, bipartisanship and national unity that all presidents, Republican and Democrat, have tried to project? Wasn’t Trump’s attack on the media an obvious attempt to distract attention from the misfortunes of his administration, including the judicial halt to his immigration ban , emerging questions of Russian influence and the resignation of national security adviser, Michael Flynn ? \nAfter all, even the conservative Fox News anchor Shepard Smith called Trump’s attack on the media “absolutely crazy” and chastised him for “repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that are not true at all”. Surely, Trump’s critics thought, this would be the final straw for Trump’s supporters. \nIn fact, most of the people who voted for Trump seem to be responding with cheers, not boos. The latest CNN poll finds that while a majority of Americans disapprove of the way Trump is handling the presidency, 90% of Republicans approve. Trump’s supporters are likely to see his press conference as a welcome reversion to the style of his presidential campaign, which was light on policy detail, but juicy with populist attacks on the media and other “elites”. \nTrump obviously enjoys campaigning more than governing. He filed paperwork for his 2020 re-election bid on the day of his inauguration. Less than a month into his presidency, he held a campaign rally yesterday in Melbourne, Florida, revisiting the venue where he spoke to a packed and enthusiastic crowd last September. \nAs it happens, I’m from Melbourne, although I now work in Washington, DC. I know a lot of people who still live in Melbourne – once you’ve become accustomed to Florida’s humid, subtropical climate it’s hard to endure northern winters – and many of them are committed Trump supporters. I taught history at an “elite” university, where Republicans of any kind were scarce. But Trump supporters aren’t some distant, threatening “other” to me. Many of them are my friends and family members. \nMelbourne, a town of 76,000 inhabitants midway up Florida’s Atlantic coast, isn’t the sort of hardscrabble, sparsely populated rural area where political observers often suggest Trump’s base is to be found. It’s a mostly middle-class area, with pockets of considerable wealth and poverty. It’s in Brevard County, which became known as the Space Coast when the first Apollo flights were launched from what is now the Kennedy Space Center. (The telephone area code, 321, is supposed to suggest the rocket countdown – “3-2-1-liftoff”.) The county’s population doubled in the 1960s and has doubled again since 1980. Demographically, it’s around four-fifths white, one-tenth African-American and about 8% Hispanic. \nBrevard County voted for Republican president Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, Democratic president Lyndon Johnson in 1964, Republican president Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972, and Democratic president Jimmy Carter in 1976. Since Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980, however, it has consistently voted for Republican presidential candidates. \nEven so, when I was growing up in Melbourne in the 1980s, I wouldn’t have characterised it as an extremely right-leaning place. Its congressional representative during those years was Bill Nelson, a local boy made good, who was a moderate-to-liberal Democrat. We cheered him at my Melbourne High School graduation when, just after he’d returned from becoming the first sitting member of Congress to fly in space, he unfurled the banner of our alma mater that he took with him on the space shuttle Columbia. \nThe county is represented by Bill Posey, who’s one of the 40 or so members of the House Freedom Caucus, the most extreme of the right-leaning factions in Congress. Posey has demonstrated little ability to pass laws, but he did make headlines in 2009 by introducing a bill to require presidential candidates to provide a copy of their original birth certificate. This was widely interpreted as perpetuating the “birther” conspiracy, which falsely claimed that President Obama was born in Kenya rather than Hawaii. \nThe most prominent champion of “birtherism” became Donald Trump , who used the issue to launch the drive that led him to the White House. And Trump resoundingly carried Brevard County in 2016, en route to winning back Florida, which Obama had carried in 2008 and 2012. \nSo how did my home town go from a Democratic representative and restrained, Reagan-style Republicanism to extremism, birtherism and Trump? I tried to find out as I visited last week. The fashionable answer on the left would be to put it all down to racism, but I haven’t seen any overt racism from my Trump-supporting friends, several of whom have voted for Obama. Brevard is home to several export-oriented companies and the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer employs hundreds of people near the same hangar where Trump delivered his anti-trade message. Some of my Melbourne friends found conservatism after finding Jesus, but Moral Majority-type evangelical conservatism is a growing, but not dominant, presence. \nWhat does seem striking about my friends in Melbourne is the extent to which they’re disillusioned with both political parties and, indeed, most institutions of American life. An early indication was in the 1992 presidential election, when the populist third-party candidate, Ross Perot, received more than a quarter of the vote, more than in any other Florida county Brevard’s size. Some of this has to do with the perception that both Republicans and Democrats conspired to shut down the space shuttle programme, which was a source of pride, jobs and identity for the Space Coast. Some of it has to do with the rise of Fox News and social media-driven political echo chambers. \nBut the disillusion runs deeper. My Melbourne friend Tony is an articulate representative of the way a lot of my other hometown friends think and feel. He grew up in a Democratic household and as a child went door to door, handing out pamphlets for Bill Nelson’s first campaign. Now, he says: “I am absolutely more conservative than my parents were.” He became increasingly disenchanted with what he saw as the increasing liberalism of the Democratic party and its decreasing concerns for bread-and-butter, working-class issues. “Flash forward a few decades,” he says, “with politicians on both sides driving us into the ground, with little concern for anything other than themselves, and apathy set in.” \nThen Trump came along. According to Tony, Trump appealed to many Democrats as well as Republicans: “What he said resonated with, and woke up, many who had fallen into that apathetic rut. People who are just beyond tired of the constant talking with no results. Tired of the 1%, or whatever you want to call it, destroying us. Banks that caused the housing crisis and ensuing crash. Our education system sucks, vets not taken care of, homeless and hungry men women and children, money sent to countries that hate us, aid to people who refuse to work, aid to people who live here illegally… the list goes on and on and on and on.” \nTrump attracted a lot of my friends and family precisely because he didn’t seem like a typical politician. He said the things other politicians wouldn’t say and didn’t sound like a poll-tested, script-reading politician either. The many things that would seem to disqualify him came across to his supporters as evidence of his authenticity. And his hostility to his own party’s establishment resonated with voters who wanted results instead of the usual partisanship and political gridlock. \nFor his supporters, it’s not important that he didn’t sound presidential at his press conference, so long as he didn’t sound like another politician. \nIt may be that Trump’s inability to pivot toward a more conventional presidential role will be his undoing. The Republicans may control both houses of Congress, but it’s unlikely they will agree on huge, consequential legislation to reform tax policy, replace Obamacare or massively invest in infrastructure unless Trump takes leadership on hard policy choices, which so far he has shown no interest in doing. And it’s unlikely that Trump’s unorthodox candidacy has repealed the time-honoured political truism that the power of the presidency is the power to persuade, to win over supporters rather than destroy enemies. \nBut, absent any major debacle – another disastrous war or economic crash – Trump’s supporters will continue to believe that he represents the only solution to a broken political process and rigged economic system. The media’s criticism will only harden that belief. \nGeoffrey Kabaservice, the research director for the Republican Main Street Partnership, is the author of Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party \n• Comments will be opened later", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:11:45.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
