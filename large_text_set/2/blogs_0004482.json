(Photo: Phillip Marshall, 247Sports) \nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. – It was a day of joy, a day of celebration. With almost two dozen family members and relatives behind him Wednesday in the Jackson-Olin High School auditorium, Tadarian Moultry signed to play football for Auburn. \nMoultry grinned. He led a “War Eagle” cheer. He posed for pictures. He did television interviews and accepted hugs and handshakes. A hard-earned dream had come true. \n“The best part was to see my family smiling,” Moultry said, “to see how many family members were here.” Moultry was \"the best player on the field\" in all-star games, according to Gus Malzahn . (Photo: Tony Morano, 247Sports) \nMoultry, rated a 5-star linebacker by 247Sports, fulfilled the commitment he made last May to sign with Auburn. And he took another step in a journey toward greatness. \n“I can’t just be average,” Moultry said. “I’m doing it for my family, my community, my friends. It’s bigger than just me.” \nMoultry’s father, Michael Grant , and his mother, Lakisha Moultry , stood nearby, watched it all and were proud. \n*** \nGrant wasn’t thinking about football in July of 2014 when, while he was driving, he answered a call from his frightened son. It was \nMoultry, TD to his friends, had gone to Central Park on Birmingham’s west side in the summer before his sophomore year. He’d convinced his father he’d be OK. He played basketball and worked out. He was hanging around with others in the park when he saw trouble brewing and called his father. Gunshots rang out. A stray bullet ripped through his right calf. \nGrant found himsef in a real-life nightmare. \n“I heard the shots and everything,” Grant said. “He knew something was about to go down. It was crazy being on the phone with your child. He was like ‘They are shooting, they are shooting.’\" And the phone went dead. Terrified, Grant raced to get to his son. \n“Now I’m running red lights and stop signs and everything to try to get there,” Grant said. “I called back a little later and a police officer answered the phone. He said ‘I know you are wide open. Just slow down. He’s going to be all right.’ I was like ‘Thank the Lord,’ because I didn’t know how it was going to turn out.” \nMoultry was wounded badly enough that he would lose his sophomore season of football, but not badly enough to cause long-term damage. Looking back today, he says he wouldn’t change a thing. \n“A lot of people think I’m crazy when I say I’m happy I got shot,” Moultry said, “but it turned my life around as a young man.” \nEven before that life-changing moment, Moultry was driven to succeed. That drive grew only stronger. He wanted to make his family proud, particularly the mother who’d always been there. \n“At first, it was difficult,” his mother said. “But he was determined. He told me ‘Mom, we are going to make some changes.’ If he sets his mind on something, he’s going to do it.” \nAs he felt the burning sensation in his leg, Moultry thought about high school football. That was his dream then. He’d had to sit out his freshman season after transferring from Wenonah High School, and now he would have to sit out another. \nTwo and a half years later, the man they call TD was the star of the show at the Ensley high school that he will soon leave for the bright lights of the Southeastern Conference. \n“When I was younger, everybody was disrespecting their moms, walking away from them,” Moultry said. “My mom is my friend, my baby. We talk about everything. Being shot just changed my way of seeing everything.” \n*** \nTim Vakakes was in his first year as Jackson-Olin head coach in 2013. Though Moultry couldn’t play, he saw a special athlete. He saw a young man with uncommon drive to succeed, uncommon work ethic and uncommon humility. He would have made an impact in 2014. The gunshot wound only delayed the inevitable.

For two years straight, the only film we had was of him dunking in the gym about three months after his gunshot wound. He started at the top of the key, jumped over a kid, caught it with one hand and dunked it. I sent that to everybody.” \nMoultry played safety as a junior, and the college coaches began to take notice. He moved to linebacker as a senior, and the interest grew stronger. A lifelong Alabama fan, he committed to Auburn and linebackers coach Travis Williams . He says he never once wavered, never considered changing his mind. \n“It was family,” Moultry said. “I love the coaches. I love Coach T-Will. All my coaches are like my father figures, from middle school to right now. Coach T-Will, any problem I have I can call him. Football isn’t promised to anybody.” \nMoultry decided early in the process that childhood allegiances would not be part of his decision. \n“I just tried to handle it like a man,” Moultry said. “I crossed a few teams out and told them why. Georgia didn’t mention education. Football isn’t going to last forever, so tell me about education. I’m interested in that. Alabama didn’t treat me like family. I’ll just leave it at that. When you are a recruit you see how it is.” \nAs Moultry was surrounded by family Wednesday, Vakakes, an Auburn graduate, chuckled. “Just about every one of them is probably a Bama fan,” he said. \nBut strike his parents off that list. Their son fell in love with Auburn. And they soon followed. \n“When we got there on campus, it was a good feeling,” his mother said. “I said ‘Now I see why you are in love.' It’s family. It’s really family. I had never been there. It was a no-brainer from then on.” \nGrant visited for the first time only in recent weeks. \n“They showed a lot of love,” Grant said. “They hit a lot of key points I believe in – education first. If you fall off, you have somebody right there. I like that.” \n*** \nIt was fitting that there was no drama in Moultry’s signing, no caps in front of him, no hidden t-shirt. He has been an Auburn guy since last May. And he happily leaves the spotlight to others. His mission is his own. \n“I don’t do that social media stuff,” Moultry said. “I don’t blow up the videos. I’m low-key. I don’t disagree with guys who do that. I’m just not like that. I don’t want attention. I’ll get my attention on the field. I don’t say how good I am. I don’t have to prove anything to anybody. If I’m good enough, it will show.” \nVakakes says it’s not just talk. Moultry, he says, is a monstrous player on the field, a combination of elite speed, elite athleticism, strength, work ethic and a burning desire to succeed that never wanes. \n“He’s different,” Vakakes said. “He’s so humble. We knew from Day 1 we had something special with him. He was a big kid, a strong kid and the hardest worker in the building. He’s the best player every Friday night. I don’t care where you go, he’s the hardest worker. His whole family is good people. He’s got good people around him. \nJim Vakakes, in his 45th year as a high school coach, is his son’s defensive coordinator. He coached former Auburn defensive linemen Frank Warren and Anthony Jones at Phillips High School in Birmingham. He coached Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney at Pelham. Moultry, he says, is unique.

His closing time is just ridiculous, and when he gets there, he’s mad,” Jim Vakakes said. “He has so much upside. He’s going to go to class. He’s going to say yes sir and no sir. He works like a dog. We have to slow him down sometimes. We had to cut him back on squats. He might have gone to 1,000 pounds. \n“He’s a great, great kid. I know he’s the best recruit Auburn got this year. He’s the best athlete in Birmingham and maybe in the Southeast. If he screws up, he listens and he fixes it. This guy has more upside than anybody I’ve seen.” \nMoultry says Auburn coaches have told him he will play inside and out, lining up sometimes at Buck and sometimes inside. He wasn’t sure about playing on the outside until he met former Auburn and NFL great Kevin Greene at the Army All-America game. \n“He said ‘You are going to be an outside backer one day,’” Moultry said. “Even before saw me play, he told me what I’d be playing. He’s in the Hall of Fame. He knows something I don’t know.” \nMoultry played at 205 pounds as a junior safety and at 225 pounds as a senior. He’s a chiseled 230 pounds now. \n“He’s just something else,” Jim Vakakes said. “We are danged sure going to miss him.” \nAs Moultry prepares to leave the high school where he earned the opportunity of a lifetime, Auburn prepares to welcome him to his new home. \n“He was extremely loyal to us,” Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said. “He helped us recruit. He’s got a unique skill set. He’s got an explosiveness that very few have playing inside linebacker. He’s got the ability to rush the passer. He really was the best player on the field in the all-star games. We are very excited about TD and think he can come in here and help right off the bat.” \nMoultry says he expects it to be hard. He knows only that he’ll be ready to do his best to represent all those who helped him get there. \n“The next level isn’t promised, but I hope I can succeed in college like I did in high school and make history like I did here,” Moultry said. “I want to make history when I get to Auburn.\" Moultry with parents Lakisha Moultry and Michael Grant .
