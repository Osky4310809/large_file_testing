The feature marks the directorial debut of Drew Pearce’s (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Iron Man 3). \nAcademy Award nominee Marc Platt ( La La Land , Drive , Wanted ) will produce alongside Adam Siegel ( Drive , 2 Guns ), and The Ink Factory’s Simon Cornwell and Stephen Cornwell (“The Night Manager”, A Most Wanted Man ). \nPenned by Pearce and set in the near future, Hotel Artemis follows a nurse (Foster) who runs an underground hospital for Los Angeles’ most sinister criminals, and finds that one of her patients is actually there to assassinate another. \n“Mr. Bautista is a force to be reckoned with — a powerful presence who’s equal parts strength and soulfulness,” Pearce said. “I’m a true fan, and it’s a privilege to have him in the world of Hotel Artemis.” \nBautista can next be seen this May in Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , the sequel to 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and most recently starred alongside Brittany Snow in Bushwick , which premiered at Sundance. In addition, he can be seen in the upcoming films Blade Runner 2049 , opposite Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling and in Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War . \n(Photo credit: Getty Images)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T18:16:11.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
