Who and what people are wearing is always the topic of conversation on red carpets. And speaking of fashion, there was an adorable girl power fashion moment at the GRAMMYs on Sunday night, and it’s one of our favorite red carpet moments of the night.\nRapper ScHoolboy Q and his daughter Joyce showed up on the GRAMMY Awards red carpet wearing matching pink outfits, and our hearts just melted.\nThe father-daughter duo clearly won best-dressed of the evening. Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for NARAS ScHoolboy Q (AKA Quincy Hanley) wore a tie-dyed hoodie that reads “Girl Power,” and his daughter wore a pink Gucci suit. Even though he was nominated for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Performance, ScHoolboy Q said that he’s not usually into the whole awards show experience. But since his daughter really wanted to go, he brought her. \nAnd he didn’t just bring her, he wore a bright pink “girl power” sweatshirt to support and empower her.\nSo basically he’s Father of the Year. Headed to da Grammys wit 2 mucH sauce \nA photo posted by ScHoolboy Q (@groovyq) on Feb 12, 2017 at 2:31pm PST \nThe message he sent his daughter — and everyone else — by wearing the sweatshirt is truly beautiful, especially at a time when the safety of women’s rights are in question.\nJoyce wasn’t the only kid at the GRAMMYs to rock pink — Blue Ivy wore a very similar suit (if not the exact same one).\n. @S_C_ & #BlueIvy take their seats at the #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/jb1gT5G3BY \n— Recording Academy (@RecordingAcad) February 13, 2017 It’s probably safe to assume that the girls know each other and wore matching suits on purpose. But if not, then it’s a pretty cool coincidence. We have a feeling Joyce had a blast at the GRAMMYs and will remember the night with her dad forever.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:51:39.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
