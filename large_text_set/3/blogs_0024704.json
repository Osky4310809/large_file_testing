ADVERTISEMENT \nNU head coach Roger Gorayeb said their win against Ateneo, which gave them sole ownership of the third seed, was a huge step for them if they want to finish in the top four of the ladder. \n“This is a huge win for us because right now we have to beat everyone we play against,” said Gorayeb whose team struggled in the first half of the season. “We fell short early in the tournament so we have to accumulate wins to finish either third or fourth.” \nGorayeb, after taking out his liberos in the fourth set of their win against University of the East, started the game against Ateneo utilizing only attacking players. \nHe inserted Gayle Valdez in the final two sets to allow them to focus on the offense and keep them fresh in the fifth period. \n“I’m just happy they were able to deliver in the crucial moments,” said Gorayeb. \nNU, though, paid the price of leaving off its liberos in the first three sets as Ateneo scored 20 service aces compared to its nine. \nThe Lady Bulldogs, though, retaliated with an aerial assault, outscoring the Lady Eagles 13-5 in blocks. \nSantiago led all scorers with 25 points while Aiko Urdas and Jorelle Singh combined for 23 points for NU. \nJhoana Maraguinot had 18 points to lead Ateneo while Kat Tolentino added 17. \nJia Morado, who’s been the catalyst to Ateneo’s offense, finished with 47 excellent sets, nine more than NU’s Jasmine Nabor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:19:27.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
