And while I assume most of you Smosh readers out there are a couple years away from house-hunting (but hey Grandma , thanks for clicking the link I sent you!), there are still some common things we all know to look for when shopping for our castle made of sand (namely, that it’s not made of sand, or any other absurd material for that matter). BUT since we've watched a ton of TV and movies in our lives, if we could live anywhere, natural disasters and homeowner’s insurance aside, here are the places we’d choose! 1. SpongeBob’s Pineapple \nvia GIPHY \nThis one bed, one (sponge)bath home is the ultimate bachelor pad. Fruit flies have been a problem in the past, but regular maintenance will keep them under control. Boasting three stories and a magnificent library, in this home, you’ll feel like king of Bikini Bottom. 2. Berenstein Bears' House \n(source) \nReady to settle down? The wife dying to wear blue pajamas all day and live in a tree trunk? Then this is the perfect place for you! Yes, if the tree should die, your entire investment will die with it. But think of all the memories you and the little ones will share! 3. Seven Dwarfs’ Cottage \nThis charming fixer-upper is the perfect place for a couple looking to renovate, or at the very least, deep clean. It can comfortably house up to eight. Be aware that while this cottage seems secluded, strangers have been known to frequent the surrounding forest and come to the cottage seeking refuge. 4. Pride Rock \nvia GIPHY \nWe can't deny it — this lovely abode’s main support beam is a single rock propped underneath another rock. However, it's held up very well with the test of time, so like... it should be fine. Pride Rock is great for the multi-wife man or the multi-husband woman. Keep all your spouses under one roof. No more mistresses tucked away in a pricey penthouse apartment! 5. Gingerbread House \n(source) \nThis is the perfect house for the MasterChef in your family. Complete with industrial grade oven, you’ll never run out of ideas for your next delicious meal. You may encounter problems during the rainy season, as the foundation is made of old gingerbread cookies and will likely get soggy and collapse. 6. Shrek’s Swamp \n(source) \nThis charming property boasts a swimming swamp, shaded patio, mud waterslide, and mud shower. Perfect for a princess or an ogre, this swamp is simply marvelous. The dead tree that makes up the roof is rotting and breeds mildew like you’ll be breeding ogre-babies in this cozy pad, but as the kids say, YO-LO. (Did I do that right?) 7. White Rabbit’s Cottage \nWhile this house was structurally sound, a recent natural disaster by the name of Alice struck and the beams haven’t been the same since. But pop culture fans will appreciate its design inspiration from Sia. 8. The Burrow \nDon’t think we’ve forgotten about those looking to rent. The Burrow has had some famous residents-- we can’t say who, but a boy who lived here at one point definitely found it charming. During the Second Wizarding War, its owners had to abandon The Burrow, leading it to be turned into a cute condominium. Each unit is affordably priced and comes fully furnished in the style of shabby chic. \nWhere do you want to live?
