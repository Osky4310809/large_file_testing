Ortiz joked in a tweet to WBZ-TV’s Dan Roche that “I’m not playing baseball anymore.” @RochieWBZ yes bro my boy is so right😊.But lm not playing baseball anymore 🙂 \n— David Ortiz (@davidortiz) February 16, 2017 \nOn Sunday, Ortiz shared a video from the beach that proves he isn’t missing the grind of spring training very much. My spring training 😎 pic.twitter.com/6efcdohjlJ \n— David Ortiz (@davidortiz) February 19, 2017 \n“So good to be retired. At the beach … This is my spring training. How about that? Enjoy. See you when I see you,” Ortiz said with a laugh. \nSorry Red Sox fans.
