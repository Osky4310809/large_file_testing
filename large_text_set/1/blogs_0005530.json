I devour 90s movies like a fat kid, communicate via memes, and, most importantly, my breasts peaked during early 2000s. This makes me a certified member of the most controversial demographic cohort of all times – a purpose-hungry, feminism-shouting individual who multitasks like it’s nobody’s business. I rotate through my week, tackling work and relationships like a boss (meme alert!). I revolve around everything that’s trending like an observant bird-watcher. I have opinions on everything available online – the way a cat meows, body transformations, mass molestations, Bollywood trailers and… you get the memo, don’t you? I am virtually omnipresent. Things were on cruise control when, one day, my Insta-winning life came crashing down. After months of undermining continuos fevers and other obvious symptoms, I was diagnosed with Abdominal TB. I was informed that my low immunity yielded to the bacteria. What leads to low immunity, you ask? Improper meals, erratic schedules, and unsupervised fevers, was what I was told. It all came back to me. In the months leading up to the big reveal, I had been oblivious of the manner in which I continuously abused my body. Work-life balance has always been an obscure concept for me. Responding with a sneer was what I did when a worrying adult questioned me about it. Camping late nights in office is a habit, and meeting deadlines is my source of validation. My work is my adrenaline rush. The seasonal fevers were nothing but a distraction. A pill was popped, and life resumed as is. Gym-frequenting, sculpted colleagues of mine were jibed at. They made all of us, including me, look bad. Working out was perceived as an activity that was, still, ten years away; an eventuality, but not the need of the hour. The present demanded us to hug our laptops and wake up to the rhythmic beat of the first message of the day. Skipping meals was NBD (slang alert!) as long as the yearly appraisal ka-chinged. The kids were all right. We were all right. Except that we aren’t. You’re thinking the girl writing this has got no chill. Well, you are damn right. I don’t. My incident is not an isolated one. Our spines are bent, minds are crowded with the Internet fluff, and our food habits sucks. Our workout resolutions are more broken than celebrity relationships. And, before you come at me with the “chill-TB-is-curable” spiel, I’d like to remind you how ridiculous you sound. That we need an ailment to strike us, to evict us from our knowingly-unhealthy lifestyles, is deeply saddening. No, this cannot be another millennial thing. We all know better than that. Take a break. Take a break even when you don’t need to. When your body aches after a long day, it is trying to communicate with you. It is hinting that you need to stop. That muscle pull in your neck is beseeching you to work fewer hours, even if it lasts a week. Fevers aren’t something that you dismiss on a trying day. Popping painkillers is not cool. For that unassuming lump on your breast, visit a doctor. Choose to react to your body because it is hoping that you will. You’d be surprised how many dialogues our body attempts to have with us. And we, while trailblazing through our lives, choose to ignore every single one of them. Of all the dialogues that we begin online, there is a long pending one that you need to have with your body.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T08:27:21.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
