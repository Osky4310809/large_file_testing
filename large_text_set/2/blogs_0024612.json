On Friday, the administration pushed back on reports that the FBI refused a White House request to publicly deny news stories about the alleged communications. \nThe FBI and CIA also assessed last year that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to aid Trump's campaign. \nThose who advocate for a Congressional investigation of possible ties between Trump's team and the Russian government include 80 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of independents and 25 percent of Republicans. \nThe partisan breakdown is nearly identical among those who want Congress to probe Russian interference in the election more broadly. That includes eighty-four percent of Democrats, 51 percent of independents and 25 percent of Republicans. \nBipartisan members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee have pledged to look into possible interactions between Trump associates and the Russian government, while the Trump administration and many Republicans in relevant Committees in the House have suggested that the probes should instead focus on rooting out the sources of the leaks. \nThe poll also asked respondents to weigh in on Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Trump has repeatedly praised during the campaign and in the early days of his presidency. About four-in-ten — 38 percent — of Americans said that Trump's relationship with Putin is too friendly, while 29 percent said that the relationship is not too friendly. \nBut just seven percent of Trump supporters say that Trump and Putin are too cozy, while 70 percent of Clinton voters say the same. \nThe poll was conducted February 18-22.
