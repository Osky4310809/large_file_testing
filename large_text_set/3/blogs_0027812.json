He revealed that the act was not new, adding that in Maiduguri, Bornu State, where he usually bought bags of beans, chemicals were used to preserve them. \nAccording to Ebonyi State-born Faith, “I buy bags of beans in Maiduguri and bring to Lagos to sell. I saw when they use chemicals in Maiduguri to preserve beans. \n“When it is applied, it prevents ants from infesting the grains. Such bags of beans can last between three to six months. But I did not instruct my brother to use any chemical. \n“On the day in question, I was in a church in Ibadan, when I received a call that my brother had been arrested. When I got there, I was told he was mixing a particular insecticide with the grains of beans.” \nOn his part, the suspect that was caught in the act, Chijoke Ogbona, admitted to have applied chemical and insecticide on some bags of beans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:53:41.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
