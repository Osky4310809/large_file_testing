Get   READ: House Democrats’ Letter Demanding Donald Trump Rescind Steve Bannon Appointment Published Updated 4:13 pm EST, November 16, 2016 15 Comments By Brendan Morrow 5.3k Share Tweet Follow Steve Bannon arrives for a Donald Trump rally in Wisconsin. (Getty) \nAfter President-Elect Donald Trump announced that Steve Bannon will become his senior adviser, 169 House Democrats signed a letter today demanding that Trump rescind his appointment. \nRhode Island Representative David Cicilline leads the 169 Democrats, and he posted the full letter on his Twitter page this afternoon. The letter discusses the fact that Steve Bannon served as executive chairman of Breitbart News, a website that has published a number of offense, anti-Semetic stories and which Bannon himself once called a platform for the alt-right. The alt-right is a fringe movement characterized by White Nationalism and an opposition to diversity and immigration. \nThe appointment of Steve Bannon was announced at the same time as Reince Priebus was announced as the next White House chief of staff, and while Republicans praised the decision to appoint Priebus, they were mostly silent on Bannon, saying that they are not familiar with anything controversial he has said or done. \nHere is the letter signed by 169 House Democrats and addressed to President-Elect Donald Trump, urging him to rescind his endorsement of Steve Bannon: \nDear President-elect Trump, \nImmediately following your victory, many Americans were optimistic and hopeful that you would take the steps necessary to unify our country following the divisive and contentious election. In your election night speech you said, “Now it’s time for America to bind the wounds of division. It is time for us to come together as one united people.” Unfortunately, your appointment of Stephen Bannon, whose ties to the White Nationalist movement have been well-documented, directly undermines your ability to unite the country. As elected representatives of millions of Americans from diverse backgrounds, and ethnicities, we strongly urge you to reconsider your decision to appoint Mr. Bannon to White House Chief Strategist. \nSince the election there have been a number of incidents across the country in which minorities, including Muslim Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Jewish Americans, have been targets of violence, harassment and intimidation. Mr. Bannon’s appointment sends the wrong message to people who have engaged in those types of activities, indicating that they will not only be tolerated, but endorsed by your Administration. Millions of Americans have expressed fear and concern about how they will be treated by the Trump administration and your appointment of Mr. Bannon only exacerbates and validates their concerns. \nAs the Executive Chairman of Breitbart News, Mr. Bannon repeatedly and aggressively pushed stories that promote anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and racism. During an interview last summer, Mr. Bannon bragged that Breitbart was “the platform for the alt-right,” a movement that upholds White Nationalism while strongly rejecting diversity in any form. Under Mr. Bannon’s leadership, Breitbart has referred to a leading Republican who opposed your election as a “Renegade Jew,” suggested “Young Muslims in the West are a ticking time bomb,” declared the “Confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage,” and praised the alt-right as a “smarter” version of “old-school racist skinheads.” \nDisturbingly, leading white nationalists like former KKK Grand Dragon David Duke, American Nazi Party Chair Rocky J. Suhayda, Richard Spencer, Peter Brimelow, and Brad Gririn have praised the news of Mr. Bannon’s appointment. We believe it should concern you that civil rights groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, are widely opposed to Mr. Bannon’s appointment. \nWe strongly believe that Mr. Bannon’s appointment will not allow the country to heal and come together as one. As one of your top advisers, the White House chief strategist will help set the tone for your Administration. The person in this role must be prepared to serve the interests of all Americans, not those of a selected few. \nOnce again, we strongly urge you to rescind the appointment immediately and build a diverse White House staff who are committed to the core American values of inclusiveness, diversity and tolerance. \nVia The Boston Globe , here are all of the House Democrats who have signed the letter: David N. Cicilline (RI-1)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T15:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:03:33.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
