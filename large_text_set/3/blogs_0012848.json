But I have no symptoms at the moment, I’ve had no treatment for the past two and a half years and if I do happen to have the treatment, the success rate is particularly strong, so I’m very lucky,” McAvaney told Channel 7. \n“It’s a nasty word, leukaemia, there are a lot of people out there fighting it and I feel for them, because in a small way I’ve been in their shoes over the past two and a half years.” \nMcAvaney said he was getting “very tired” late last year, which is why he made the decision not to take part in the Australian Open coverage for the first time in over two decades. \n“Probably my immune system is not quite as strong as it once was,” McAvaney said. \n“But I am revitalised, rejuvenated and, as I said, I feel very well.” \nCumani said she was thrilled to again be working alongside McAvaney. \n“You look incredibly well and your energy is overflowing as always, so it’s great to have you,” Cumani said. \nMcAvaney then shifted focus back to the race meet, saying he was “looking forward to today, as we all do” before throwing to a colleague at the mounting yard. \nBruce was back — and more determined than ever to passionately bring viewers as close to the action as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T04:03:15.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
