The main payload is the indigenous Earth Observation Satellite, CartoSat-2D. The remaining co-passengers are all nanosatellites, mostly based on the CubeSat standard. There are 88 satellites on board from Planet Labs, which is a record in itself as the most number of satellites of a single constellation deployed at once.\nThe nanosatellites are piggybacking on a launch meant primarily for the CartoSat-2D, and Isro is using it’s “workhorse” launch vehicle to its full capacity. The commercial arm of Isro, was responsible for getting the nanosatellites on board, and more than half of the mission cost will be recovered because of the foreign satellites.\n\nThe live cast may use some unfamiliar terms and short forms, so here is a small primer.\nPSLV – Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, India’s most reliable rocket.\nXL – A configuration of the PSLV that has six additional strap on motors. The launch vehicle is then designated as PSLV-XL. If the rocket is used without the strap on motors, it is called the PSLV-CA variant, the CA stands for Core Alone.\nCubeSat – an easily configurable nanosatellite platform that was originally developed for academic purposes.\nINS – Isro Nano Satellite, an indigenous standard similar to the CubeSat\nSDSC – Satish Dhawan Space Centre, India’s main rocket launching facility. India still launches sounding rockets from its first launch facility, Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station ( TERLS ).\nSHAR – Sriharikota High Altitude Range, the particular facility in SDSC that launches rockets. Often used interchangeably with SDSC.\nFLP – First Launch Pad, the launch pad being used for the PSLV-C37 mission. There are two active launch pads at SDSC, and a third one is planned.\nSSO – Sun Sychronous Orbit is an orbit where satellites pass over a point at the same time every day. This orbit is particularly useful for imaging the earth, as it offers consistent lighting across many passes. A mid morning pass is ideal as it has the least amount of shadows.\nIsro – Indian Space Research Organisation\nAntrix – The commercial arm of Isro, responsible for getting marketing India’s launch services. Antrix negotiated the deals to get the 101 foreign satellites on board.\n\nThis story is a part of a series on the world record launch of 104 satellites on a single mission by Isro.
