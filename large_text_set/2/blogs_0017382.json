On February 15, Nokia performed at a charity fashion show for the school and ended her performance when a white male student \"harassed her during her performance\" and mouthed \"dirty obscenities like, show me your tits.'\" The event was recounted in a post on Fly, Cambridge University's forum for women and non-binary people of color. \nAccording to The Cambridge Student , Nokia threw a drink over the man and hit him three times in response to his remarks. She left the stage after performing three songs. Richelle George and Jason Okundaye, who wrote the post on Fly, met Nokia after the event where she expressed that she has a \"'zero tolerance' stance towards 'instances of sexism and sexual harassment.'\" She also passed on an apology to women of color in the audience, stressing that the incident was \"a disgraceful public display of sexism and misogynoir.\" \nPhoto: Taken from Princess Nokia's Instagram \nFollow Noisey on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:40:15.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
