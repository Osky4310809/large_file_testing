Doing this means you don't have to sort it out manually; your device is fresh each time you come to use it. There are several approaches you can take, which we'll outline here. Wallpaper Changer \nInstalling a dedicated app is perhaps the easiest way of changing your Android device's wallpaper on a schedule. Wallpaper Changer is the best-known app for the job, though there are others around on Google Play. \nFire up Wallpaper Changer to find the app's settings. You can choose a certain number of minutes, hours or days as your interval, set how the app resizes or crops images, opt to change the wallpaper every time you unlock your phone, and set your wallpapers to cycle through in a random order if you prefer. Wallpaper Changer lets you set your schedule and adjust a few other options. / © AndroidPIT Wallpaper Changer \nThere are a couple of other settings to tweak: you'll need to choose the Wallpaper Changer live wallpaper as the wallpaper on your device (press and hold a blank part of the home screen to do this) and then compile a group of images via the Albums tab. If you upgrade to the Pro version of Wallpaper Changer you can manage several different albums. IFTTT \nAnother way of rotating through several wallpapers on your Android device is via the always-impressive \"If This Then That (IFTTT)\". It connects apps and services using triggers that lead to actions — and one of the supported actions is switching the background on a connected Android device. We made an IFTTT recipe to change the wallpaper every time a new photo is posted to Instagram from within a certain area. / © AndroidPIT IFTTT \nOnce you've signed up to IFTTT and started work on your wallpaper-shifting recipe, you can choose all kinds of triggers: a new photo in a Dropbox folder, a newly liked image on Instagram, a new picture from an RSS feed, something from your Flickr feed, and so on. \nFor example, we created a Recipe to change the wallpaper on a Redmi Note 3 whenever IFTTT found a new public Instagram photo taken in a nearby city center. It's not as straightforward a solution as using a dedicated app, but it gives you a lot more flexibility when setting the routine. \nYou can find out more about the possibilities IFTTT offers here: 10 delightfully useful IFTTT recipes Arrow Launcher by Microsoft \nMicrosoft's sleek Arrow Launcher includes Bing wallpapers that are updated daily.
