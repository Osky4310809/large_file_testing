He is still in bed. \n\"He's not available and I don't think he will be available for the next game as he hasn't done anything for a week.\" \nOzil is not expected to feature in the 18-man squad taking on Preston North End in the FA Cup third round this weekend. \nArsenal return to league action on January 14 with a trip to Swansea City.
