Marc Stein of ESPN and Shams Charania of The Vertical reported the news. Jones, 25, played 51 games for the New Orleans Pelicans this season before being waived Feb. 23. He averaged 11.5 points and 5.9 rebounds in 24.8 minutes per game. The Pelicans and Jones mutually chose to move on after New Orleans acquired DeMarcus Cousins at the All-Star break. \"We released him because, obviously, if you look at the bigs situation we have now and there was not going to be a whole lot of minutes,\" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry told reporters when Jones was released. \"He wants to play. Obviously, he's going to be a guy in a contract year and things like that, so we thought it was best to let him go.\" The Bucks have a glut of bigs on their roster but have been ravaged by injuries. Jabari Parker is out for the remainder of the regular season due to an ACL tear, and Michael Beasley is out through at least Saturday's game against the Toronto Raptors after hyperextending his knee . Jones may temporarily step into Beasley's role while he recovers. He may also wind up getting minutes previously slotted for Mirza Teletovic and Thon Maker, with whom coach Jason Kidd hasn't been entirely comfortable. Jones performed well for the most part during his stint in New Orleans and should slot in fine as a rotational big. Having signed a minimum contract to come to the Pelicans last offseason—in part due to opportunity—Jones should be able to use the stretch run to get a raise as a free agent this summer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:04:35.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
