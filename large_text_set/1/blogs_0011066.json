Raymond Lopez (15th). \nAn assault-style weapon was likely used and almost 30 shell casings were found at the crime scene. \nThe four who were struck tried to flee, but they made it only to the parking lot of a vacant business at the southwest corner of Archer and Western, where an 18-year-old man who had been shot in the head died, according to Lopez and Chicago Police. \nTwo more men were taken in critical condition to Stroger Hospital, with an 18-year-old shot in the back and a 22-year-old shot in the face, according to police and fire officials. The fourth victim, a 25-year-old man, was in good condition at Mount Sinai Hospital with an arm wound. \nAuthorities initially said a fifth victim had been shot, but later said that person had suffered injuries from the vehicle’s shattered glass and was taken to a hospital in good condition. \nLopez addressed the media in the pouring rain with community activist Andrew Holmes, a regular presence at crime scenes across the city. \n“This is unacceptable,” Lopez said. “We have to get these guns off the street. We have to stop this senseless killing in our neighborhoods. We have got to come together to put an end to the retaliatory culture of conflicts on our streets.” \nLopez said there has been an increase in assault-style guns recovered in his ward. Recently, he said, a “machine pistol” was recovered by police. \nThe alderman chalked up the shootings to gang members looking solely to inflict as much damage as they can. \n“These are gang members who are on a mission to kill as many of their opposition as possible,” Lopez said. “There’s no rhyme or reason. They’re almost killing for sport, just so they can say that they killed that gang member or that gang member, for the bragging rights of saying they’ve killed people.” \nLopez said the targets of Wednesday’s shooting were likely in the same gang as the targets in another nearby shooting last month that left two dead and two wounded at 43rd and Rockwell. \n“Someone inside of their home, I can guarantee you, knows where these weapons [are] at, what garage they’re hiding them in, what abandoned car they’re hiding them in,” Holmes said. “Before it hits some baby or some child, that person needs to give this information up or they’re going to have blood on their hands.” Previously from Chicago News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T05:51:58.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
