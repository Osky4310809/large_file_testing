This year, among a few choice others , we were treated to a new Guardians Of the Galaxy, Vol.2 preview and, you guys, it was set to Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain.” Advertisement \nThe trailer itself tells us little about the much-anticipated sequel, but really, does it need to? We see each of the Guardians engaged in a brief moment of bad-assery. Dave Bautista’s Drax—the well-muscled blue dude perpetually befuddled by sarcasm—is funny, though not as delightful as he is in some of the earlier trailers. And then, of course, we have a fetching moment with Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel...somehow). Recent trailers indicate that Baby Groot sports a new tiny red jacket, and I die. \nAnd once more, Fleetwood Mac! Better yet, Rumours -era Fleetwood Mac! I’m pumped. Everybody enjoy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:37:06.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
