I would say, [he’d] have two paddles, you can stand by it or take it back. If you take it back, you take it back forever. If you stand by it, you’ve got to tell me why, and I felt like that was such a good game.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:09:41.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
