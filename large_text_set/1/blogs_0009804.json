They put plastic ties around her wrists but she managed to squeeze her hands out of the wrist ties by wriggling her hands,\" a source said. \n\"She was hysterical but not screaming as she knew she had to keep quiet to survive. \n\"The reports of her fear of being raped are real. She really did think she was going to be raped. She had a gun to her head the whole time.\" \nThe 35-year-old reality star, who was staying at the exclusive The No Address Hotel, was terrified as the men raided the luxury property, snatching two mobile phones and $10million worth of jewellery.

(Photo: Getty) \nAccording to Page Six, a source claims investigators believe the raiders may have known the whereabouts of the reality star from an employee at the hotel or someone in her team. \n\"French police suspect that the five alleged robbers had some contact with her security and were tipped off about her procedures,\" they claimed. \n\"They knew there was no security [with her inside her apartment that night]. All they had to do was go in, make contact with someone inside the hotel.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T14:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T09:53:06.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
