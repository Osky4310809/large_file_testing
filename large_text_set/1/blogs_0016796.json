Some may say that Hollywood has officially given up since they’re now making movies about school supplies, but I say that Hollywood has finally started brain-farting up original ideas. A Lisa Frank movie is what we all need and I hope this leads to a riveting and gritty biopic about every child’s first drug pusher Mr. Sketch .\nAbout three years ago, Jezebel did an expose about how the Lisa Frank company may look like a rainbow-coated wonderland of glittery panda queefs on the outside, but on the inside it was a torture chamber of craziness and abuse. Lisa Frank’s husband at the time was the company’s CEO and he was allegedly a real coke-snorting demon. Now THAT is the movie that really should be made, but that may have to wait. The Hollywood Reporter says that this Lisa Frank movie focuses on the raver unicorns and neon dolphins.\nLisa Frank is working with producer Jon Shestack to bring her world to the movie screen. Lisa released this statement about it:\n“I have always wanted to do a feature film that brings the world of Lisa Frank to life. We have so much backstory on our characters and they have been alive in my imagination since the beginning.”\nThere’s no script and there’s no director involved yet, so it’s probably far off from getting a release date. But the second it gets a release date, every dealer who specializes in acid better mark it down in their Lisa Frank planner, because that’s going to be the busiest business day in history.\nPic : Lisa Frank", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T03:13:54.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
