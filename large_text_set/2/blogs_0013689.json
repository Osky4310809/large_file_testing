I always worked really hard to have what I have today and thank God my life is NOT based around money. I have respect for myself and I don't depend on anybody to earn anything 'cause everything that I have comes from the Lord. Do not judge without knowing what happened. God bless you guys,\" he said.

She has since set her account to private and deactivated the comments section. \nDuring an interview, Erich was asked if money was the reason for her breakup with Daniel, who she was with for two years. She answered: \" Tungkol sa pera, ayoko na po magdetalye tungkol diyan . (With regard to money, I don't want to talk about it.) Like what I said, I just really wanna move on.\" \nDaniel's sister Vanessa later took to social media to ask Erich to clear up the issue, as people were accusing the Matsunagas of using Erich for her money. Erich responded to Vanessa as well.
