President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in the House of Representatives have for months assured Americans that their plan to repeal Obamacare would not leave millions uninsured. Take this promise on the House Republican website , which was still up as of Monday afternoon: House GOP website pic.twitter.com/f4sPOfZsgm — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) March 13, 2017 There were also the many times Trump promised, on the campaign trail and after he was elected, that he would “take care of everyone” and pledging “insurance for everyone.” On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) suggested those promises were wrong: The Republican-backed American Health Care Act would leave 24 million more people uninsured compared with current law by 2026. Republicans argue that the CBO estimate doesn’t tell the whole picture, because their current bill is only part of a “three-prong approach” for health care reform, with more bills coming down the line. But already, the American Health Care Act is facing a lot of opposition, including from key Senate Republicans . If this bill is on such uncertain ground, how can anyone be sure that future bills will pass? This really could be it for Republican health care reform, and, despite past promises, it could leave millions without insurance. Watch: The Republican health care bill makes no sense Was this article helpful?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:30:58.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
