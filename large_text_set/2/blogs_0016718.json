She is one of President Trump’s primary spokespersons, an almost daily figure on cable news shows. Some people admire her staunch advocacy for her client’s positions, and others applaud the fact that she was the first woman to manage a successful presidential campaign. But in fact, as is true of many of President Trump’s statements, her advocacy on his behalf is often at variance with the truth. \nMs. Conway invented the now-infamous phrase “alternative fact,” to defend Trump’s claims about the size of crowds at his inauguration, a thinly-veiled autocratic scheme to try to claim that the Trump inauguration drew the biggest crowd in history when, in fact, it was on the smaller side. Ms. Conway has been part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power. Perhaps the “Bowling Green Massacre” comment was truly a mistake, as she claims, but she repeated that canard on three different occasions as an explanation for why the travel ban, an executive order that clearly discriminates against Muslims, was necessary. \nWhen asked by the Washington Post what her response to the harsh comments was, Conway pointed out McGuire’s hypocrisy. \n“It’s a disappointment to have the president of the university lift up other Trinity graduates who have a casual relationship with the truth,” Conway told the Post, citing House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who also went to Trinity Washington, class of 1962. \nConway added that she is disappointed that McGuire is quick to “attack” her, yet “never have the courtesy of calling or emailing me to ask what I meant on any given occasion.” \nBut when it came to money, Conway said McGuire had no problem asking, explaining that she and her husband donated $50,000 to the university between 1999-2002 during a fundraising campaign. \n“My money was good,” Conway said. \nTrinity Washington University is a small, private, all girls, Catholic college located in Washington D.C.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:03:47.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
