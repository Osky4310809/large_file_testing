Flying out here was something I hadn’t done in a while.” Farmers Insurance Open: Articles, photos and videos \nWoods said it was a “long process” before each round, trying to get loose and stay warm when the temperature hovered around 50. He had four layers on during the opening round, then wore rain pants Friday on a clear, brisk morning. \n“That’s one of the things that I hadn’t dealt with,” he said. “We’re basically in a dome down there in South Florida.” \nWoods won’t face conditions like that in Dubai, with a long-range forecast that calls for sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-70s. After the European Tour event, he will have a week off before playing back-to-back weeks at Riviera and PGA National.
