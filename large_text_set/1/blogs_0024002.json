From relationships to break-ups, to fights and friendships, somebody or the other is always in the news. (Pardon us for sounding like a horrible gossipy aunty.) In light of that, there have been a LOT of celebrity couples in the recent past that we currently might not be able to recall, or have blocked out. If you're brave enough, refresh your memory, here. Sushmita Sen and Randeep Hooda \nPossibly the only relationship on this list we were genuinely happy about, we were hoping Sushmita and Randeep's love was permanent. But after being together for over three years, the couple called it quits, with Randeep even saying \"the break-up was the best thing that ever happened\" to him. Saif Ali Khan and Rosa Catalano \nThis odd, surprising couple met at a show in Kenya, after which Italian model, Rosa moved to Mumbai, where the two supposedly lived together for about three years. According to rumours, the couple broke up because Saif hid his marriage with Amrita Singh, and his children, from Rosa, which we find very hard to believe. But we're so glad they did, because otherwise the world would've been deprived of the perfection that are Saif and Kareena, and their little baby Taimur. Jacqueline Fernandez and Sajid Khan \nWe still can't believe that this was real, but Sajid and Jacqueline started dating after falling for each other on the sets of Housefull 2 . Supposedly, Sajid was over-possessive and was stifling Jackie, which was one of the things that led to their break-up. While Jacqueline never really commented on the relationship, Sajid seemed to have a lot to say, after their relationship ended. (And the world was restored to its original balance, and Jackie's career was SO much the better for it.) Kangana Ranaut and Adhyayan Suman \nAfter meeting on the sets of the film, Raaz , Kangana and Adhyayan began dating, but broke up soon after. But last year, in the midst of the horrible Hrithik-Kangana scandal, an interview of Adhyayan's with DNA about his relationship with Kangana, shocked everybody. Supposedly, during their relationship, Kangana abused Adhyayan, tried to cast some black magic spells on him, and basically ruined his life. We really don't know how to feel about these allegations, or if we believe them, but it almost seems like the plot for another instalment of the film, Raaz . Kim Sharma and Yuvraj Singh \nAn example of the common cricket-Bollywood crossover relationships, was one-time couple, Yuvraj Singh and Kim Sharma. The two dated for around four years, and were even set to get married. But the couple broke up, for two alleged, bizarre reasons - one, that Yuvraj's mother had a problem with Kim \"exposing too much\" in her films, and the other being Kim's \"obsessive and abusive\" behaviour. While we might never know what went wrong with their relationship, the two are now happily married. Priyanka Chopra and Harman Baveja \nHaving dated for five years, Priyanka and Harman broke up in 2009, but still remained friends, and even worked together in What's Your Rashee ? after their break-up. Harman's family too, was very close to Priyanka, and supposedly remained so. We think they were an oddly sweet couple together, though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T10:29:43.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
