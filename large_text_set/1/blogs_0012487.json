REAL Melody Pond - Doctor Who - A Good Man Goes to War - Series 6 - BBC One more memorable moment 04:11 \"Hello Sweetie!\" River Song Meets The Twelfth Doctor - Doctor Who The Husbands Of River Song - BBC Behind the scenes video Introducing the Pond Family - Doctor Who Confidential - Series 6 - Episode 13 - BBC Three Contents \nProfessor River Song (born Melody Pond ) was a \" child of the TARDIS \" and the wife of the Doctor , specifically his eleventh incarnation . She was human with Time Lord DNA, conceived by her parents, Amy Pond and Rory Williams , aboard the TARDIS as it traveled through the Time Vortex , and then raised and conditioned by the Silence . ( TV : A Good Man Goes to War ) This gave her great strength, the ability to regenerate and a great understanding of the complex principles of time and space . ( TV : The Time of Angels , Day of the Moon , A Good Man Goes to War , The Wedding of River Song ) She loved the Doctor, and shared a long-lasting relationship with him. River was one of the very few people who knew the Doctor's true name . ( TV : Forest of the Dead , The Name of the Doctor ) \nMelody was stolen from her parents as an infant by Madame Kovarian to become a weapon of the Silence in their war against the Doctor. After a later regeneration, she killed the Eleventh Doctor, but then broke her mental conditioning to give her remaining regenerations to revive his corpse. Before doing this, the Eleventh Doctor asked her - still using the name Melody Pond - to give a message to someone named River Song. When told the message, she replied with, \"Well, I'm sure she knows.\" She then asked who River Song was, and learnt that she was River Song. ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) \nThe Doctor and her parents left her to make her own way in the universe . With no connection to her family or the Silence, River became an archaeologist , ostensibly to track the Doctor through time. She crossed the Doctor's path on several occasions, generally with the result that she was meeting him at progressively earlier points in his own time stream . Hoping to avoid temporal paradoxes , the Doctor gave her a diary to keep track of their meetings and to prevent her from revealing \" spoilers \" to him about his own future. \nAgain forced by the Silence, she made a second attempt on the Eleventh Doctor's life. Though actually unsuccessful, she was convicted of his murder and spent many years in Stormcage Containment Facility for it — apparently to convince the universe that the Doctor actually was dead. This confinement was made more bearable by escaping frequently to go out on dates with the Doctor. ( HOMEVID : First Night , Last Night ) She was eventually pardoned, due to there being no evidence that the Doctor ever existed, and became a Professor of Archaeology . ( TV : The Angels Take Manhattan ) \nAfter a final adventure with the Twelfth Doctor which ended with them spending a twenty-four year long night at the Singing Towers of Darillium , ( TV : The Husbands of River Song ) she died saving the Tenth Doctor , Donna Noble , Strackman Lux , and the 4,022 people saved in the computer system in the Library . The Tenth Doctor saved her consciousness digitally to the Library's computer system CAL . ( TV : Forest of the Dead ) This data echo desired a true goodbye from the Doctor, and persisted for some time. ( TV : The Name of the Doctor ) Biography Conception and gestation \nMelody was conceived on or soon after her parents' wedding night, aboard the Doctor's TARDIS while transiting the Time Vortex . Melody's mother , Amy Pond was kidnapped during or shortly after her honeymoon and replaced with a living flesh doppelgänger . The ganger functioned as an avatar through which Amy perceived existence as if she was present in place of the Ganger. In reality, Amy was taken to a church marine base on the Demons Run asteroid in the 52nd century to gestate Melody. Through some combination of the circumstances of her conception in the vortex, plus interference by the Silence , Melody developed Time Lord characteristics ( TV : A Good Man Goes to War ) including regeneration . ( TV : Day of the Moon , Let's Kill Hitler ) Birth \nMelody was born on Demons Run. Melody's mother Amy insisted using her maiden surname, Pond, for Melody. Amy opined that \"Melody Williams\" was a name of a geography teacher, whereas \"Melody Pond\" evoked a superhero . Amy told the infant Melody that she would never be alone, that her father was coming for them and not even an army could stop him. The centuries-old Last Centurion would never let them down. ( TV : A Good Man Goes to War ) \nWithin a month, Melody was replaced with a ganger and taken by Madame Kovarian to the 20th century to be reared to kill the Doctor . ( TV : Day of the Moon , The Almost People , A Good Man Goes to War ) She was chosen for this task because of her conception in the Time Vortex. This gave her the potential for great strength and regeneration , to pilot the TARDIS and understand complex principles of time and space . ( TV : The Time of Angels , Day of the Moon , A Good Man Goes to War , The Wedding of River Song ) \nIt was through her ganger avatar that Melody first met her father and the Eleventh Doctor . The Doctor, claiming he could speak baby, told her that she should call Amy mummy, not \"big milk thing\", before correcting her by saying that his bow tie's cool. Melody's connection to her ganger was severed, and her ganger thus liquefied, while her father and others fought to save her from the Headless Monks . ( TV : A Good Man Goes to War ) A little girl lost \nMelody was kidnapped and trained by the Silence to kill the Doctor; she later claimed this part of her life was \"a bit of a jumble\" to remember due to their memory-erasing powers. ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) \nAs a little girl, she ended up in Graystark Hall Orphanage in 1969 Florida , under heavy security. ( TV : Day of the Moon ) Melody was forced into an Apollo astronaut suit that the Silence upgraded with alien technology. The suit could move autonomously and would insert Melody into itself both for control and to provide sustenance. The suit's artificial intelligence and communication faculties automatically put the frightened Melody in contact with the highest authority it could find: President Richard Nixon , at whatever telephone was closest to him at a given moment. Melody repeatedly rang Nixon, asking for help and describing the \"spaceman\" (the suit) going to \"eat\" her (autonomously place her within itself), but not knowing what help she needed or where precisely she was. ( TV : The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon ; WC : Prequel (The Impossible Astronaut) ) A young Melody escapes her space suit, and flees. ( TV : Day of the Moon ) \nThese telephone calls led to her first physical meeting with the Eleventh Doctor , and the earliest contact with him which she would presumably remember. From his and her parents' perspective, however, they had yet to meet via her infant Flesh ganger on Demons Run. She approached the Doctor whilst in the space suit, prompting her mother to shoot at her in fear of the Doctor's impending death; the suit's visor was damaged, but Melody was unharmed. ( TV : The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon ) \nShe returned to Graystark three months later, to discover her mother in her room. Melody begged her for help, but Amy was confused because of a picture of herself with Melody as an infant. With the arrival of the Silence , Melody forced her way out of the suit and fled; she lingered long enough to see the Doctor once more. ( TV : Day of the Moon ) Melody's first regeneration. ( TV : Day of the Moon ) \nDuring the next six months, she made her way to New York City . She developed a terminal illness but knew she could \"fix it\" by regenerating . She was in an alley when she finally succumbed to her ailment in January 1970 , and regenerated. ( TV : Day of the Moon , Let's Kill Hitler ) Mels \nGrowing up again, Melody went by Mels for short. With the Silence continuing her training, Melody grew up knowing that Amelia Pond and Rory Williams were her parents; she became good friends with them, despite often having outbursts of reckless criminal behaviour into her adolescence. Like Amelia, Mels often mistreated and bossed around Rory. ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) Mels fighting two of Krampus's goblins. ( COMIC : Imaginary Enemies ) \nMels attended Leadworth Primary School with her parents. During Year Three, she was the only person Veronica Stackmore was afraid of. One year, after Veronica stole Amelia's Raggedy Doctor doll, Mels dressed up in a mask and proclaimed herself \"the Sheep of Doom.\" She successfully scared Veronica into giving Amelia her doll back, but not before beheading it. Mels assured her mother that the doll could be repaired with some tape. When Amelia asked why adults did not believe the things Veronica did, Mels said she felt adults were dumb and that she might stay a kid forever. When Krampus and his goblins invaded Leadworth, the goblins told Mels they had heard \"many stories\" about her and then tried to attack her, but instead she used her super human strength to attack them. Afterward, Krampus trapped Mels, along with her parents, by wrapping them in Christmas wrapping. When Veronica denied Krampus, he and his goblins vanished, leaving only Mels with memories of the incident. After the school nativity play in which her parents played Mary and Joseph, Mels presented her mother with her repaired Raggedy Doctor doll and agreed with her grandfather that Amelia and Rory made a \"lovely couple.\" ( COMIC : Imaginary Enemies ) \nMels held the school record for confiscated property. She once had Amy and Rory cause a distraction so she could sneak her confiscated items out of the teachers' supply closet and then escaped over the roof and through the window of the teachers' loo. ( PROSE : Nothing O'Clock ) \nIronically, Amy largely reared Mels without knowing she was doing so. Amelia would wait for Mels outside of the headmistress' office and lecture her after these incidents much in the way a mother customarily would. Mels was obsessed over Amelia's \"Raggedy Doctor\", dreaming of marrying him and claimed in school that historical disasters were his fault because he did not intervene; all of these negative views of the Doctor came from her conditioning by the Silence. Mels was also involved in stealing cars and buses. ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) Mels finally meets the Doctor. ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) \nMels eventually helped Amy see that Rory loved her after she spent an entire decade thinking he was gay , as he never spent time with any other girl; she thus ensured her own existence, which would have ceased without her intervention. ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) Mels decided not to attend their wedding though, ( TV : The Big Bang ) citing that she \"[didn't] do weddings\". ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) Becoming River Song Mels regenerates. ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) \nIn Autumn 2011 , Melody stole a car (again) and followed her parents to a cornfield, where the Doctor had arrived due to their \"message\". They were trying to contact him in hopes that after several months he had found their infant daughter lost to them at Demons Run . Introducing herself, Melody held the Doctor at gunpoint to get away from the police. Demanding to be taken to kill Hitler , Melody shot the TARDIS, causing it to crash into Hitler's office in 1938 , inadvertently saving him from the Teselecta . She was then accidentally hit by a stray bullet Hitler fired at the Teselecta , forcing her to regenerate; her new form was recognised as River Song by the Doctor and her parents. As programmed, River killed the Doctor, using a lipstick containing an incurable poison. Cheerily calling herself a psychopath, Melody ran amok in Berlin , stealing clothes from patrons at the posh Hotel Adlon. Through a great sacrifice, Melody \"becomes\" River. ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) \nThe Teselecta (which had taken her parents on board) decided to punish her next, but the Doctor stopped them. When her parents were in danger of being killed by its antibodies , Melody was surprised to see the Doctor ignore his pain for the sake of saving them. She also became jealous of the \"River Song\" he kept mentioning, demanding to know who she was. However, the Doctor had her pilot the TARDIS (which taught her how) to save Amy and Rory. Melody then agreed to give a message to River Song from the dying Doctor, and he whispered it in her ear. Asking who River was, Amy had the Teselecta turn into Melody's new incarnation. Melody realised that she was the person the Doctor kept calling for help. Amy asked Melody what the Doctor whispered in her ear. Instead of answering that question, Melody asked her parents if the Doctor was \"worth it.\" Upon being told \"yes,\" Melody reawakened the Doctor and kissed him, using her remaining regeneration energy to bring him back to life. She passed out in the process. \nThe Doctor took River to the \"best hospital in the universe\" to recover. Knowing of her future as an on-and-off companion, he left a TARDIS-shaped diary as a gift, hoping to avoid \"spoilers\", foreknowledge that might wreck the universe. ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) The next morning River found the clothes her parents left for her; she believed Amy bought them as there were too many short skirts. However, they had not left River anything to write in her diary with. The nurses called the closest antique shop and were able to secure a pen for River, the latter of which were extremely rare in the 52nd century , and she used it to make the first entry in her diary. ( GAME : The Eternity Clock ) \nHoping to find the Doctor once again, River entered the Luna University in 5123 . When asked why she wished to study archaeology, River said she was \"looking for a good man\". Her studies led to her knowing some of the Doctor's locations in the past. ( TV : Let's Kill Hitler ) Adventures with the Doctor River under Lake Silencio , waiting for the Eleventh Doctor . ( TV : Closing Time ) \nThe day River received her doctorate, Kovarian appeared with agents of the Church and the Silence. They seized her, forced her into a modified astronaut suit, took her to Utah on 22 April 2011 and submerged her in Lake Silencio to await the Doctor. ( TV : Closing Time ) \nWhen the time came to kill him, River drained her weapon pack to defy a fixed point in time . Time shredded into a reality where all history happened at once. She initially refused to rectify her error. River confessed to Kovarian that she had fallen in love with the Doctor. She also confessed this to the Doctor himself. At the top of the Great Pyramid with the Doctor, Amy and Rory, River said to the Doctor that she could not let him die and it would be her who would suffer the most if she killed him. After marrying the Doctor and sharing a kiss, she went through with his apparent murder to restore the timeline , knowing he was really safe inside the Teselecta . ( TV : The Wedding of River Song ) Imprisonment \nRiver was sentenced to twelve thousand consecutive life sentences in the Stormcage Containment Facility in the 52nd century for the Doctor's murder. ( TV : The Time of Angels , The Pandorica Opens , HOMEVID : First Night ) She served the sentence to make the Silence believe him dead, but often escaped to spend time with her husband, then returned to her cell. They started on her very first night in the prison, when he paid a visit to bring her to Calderon Beta and explained to her the purpose of their diaries. ( HOMEVID : First Night ) \nDuring her imprisonment in Stormcage, the Doctor and River visited Easter Island and met \" Jim the Fish .\" ( TV : The Impossible Astronaut ) River attended a party with the Doctor and helped him search pet shops for a Queen of England who had become a goldfish . ( HOMEVID : Bad Night ) River and the Doctor had an adventure involving a euphonium , a biplane and someone named Marilyn. ( HOMEVID : Good Night ) \nRiver also escaped from Stormcage on her own using her Vortex manipulator . During one such adventure, five years after her imprisonment, she encountered several Sontarans who shot at and chased her halfway across the galaxy after she asked them if they were on a \"hen night.\" She escaped into the TARDIS where the Doctor returned her to Stormcage via her vortex manipulator to prevent her from interacting with her past self and her future self. ( HOMEVID : Last Night ) Picnic at Asgard This section needs a cleanup.\nThis paragraph is way too long for a character page; plot summaries go on story pages. In addition, some of this is written in the wrong tense. \nRiver was able to trade ninety-five sugar mice that arrived 4,600 years past their sell-by date and an incredibly rare and protective holy relic sent to her by Father Octavian years before for a Time Hopper from another Stormcage inmate named Frodene. Using the Time Hopper, River travelled back to before her jail cell was completed and escaped to meet up with the Doctor for a date on Asgard , a planet-sized theme park. While the two initially enjoyed themselves greatly, a mechanical dragon suddenly malfunctioned, forcing the Doctor and River to rescue a young boy named Mure. Afterwards, the Doctor and River visited the Command Center, where the Park Director Caius Roose insisted it was a minor malfunction, but a security officer named Postumus Fearne believed it wasn't. Following Postumus' directions, the two headed for the dining hall at Valhalla and used the park's subway system to sneak around undetected. Encountering Postumus again, River learned that the dimensional calibrator for the dining hall had been messed with, causing the dimensions to start to fold in on themselves, which would inevitably be fatal for those inside the hall. River and the Doctor led the Valkyries in rescuing the diners from the dining hall, and the Doctor demanded to know which of the diners messed with the dimensional calibrator. One made a break for it, but River caught the culprit, a fifteen-year-old boy named Tomith who had hacked the security system just to mess around and didn't intend any harm. While Caius initially intended to have Tomith executed for his crime as per the law, the Doctor convinced him to spare Tomith and instead give him a job fixing Asgard's security problems, and to pass off the incident as a major test of the park's security systems. Afterwards, the Doctor gave Mure a blunted sword that could shoot tiny fireworks, and Postumus kept the emptied park open for the two of them alone, allowing them to have a picnic and enjoy the park's attractions before the Doctor returned River to Stormcage to avoid her absence being noticed. ( PROSE : Picnic at Asgard , TV : Silence in the Library , The Husbands of River Song ) Return to the Battle of Demons Run \nOn one birthday, the Doctor took her to the last Winter Frost Fair on the River Thames in 1814 . Stevie Wonder performed, not knowing where and when he had truly been brought, before being restored to his proper time. Back at Stormcage, River met Rory in his Roman garb. She refused to come aid them at Demons Run, saying she couldn't be there \"until the very end\". ( TV : A Good Man Goes to War ) \nAfter Kovarian had fled with her infant incarnation at the end of the Battle of Demons Run , baby Melody's connection to her ganger was severed, and her ganger was liquefied, horrifying Amy. Minutes later, River appeared, announcing her presence with a prompt, \"Well soldier, how goes the day?\" and revealed her identity as Melody Pond, first to the Doctor and then to her parents. River uses a prayer leaf given to Amy on which Lorna Bucket had embroidered Melody Pond in the closest translation of the language of the Gamma Forests , River Song. ( TV : A Good Man Goes to War ) Silence in America \nOn receiving an invitation from the Doctor, River escaped from Stormcage to meet Amy, Rory and him in Utah in the United States on 22 April 2011. ( TV : The Impossible Astronaut ) The Doctor, inside a Teselecta double of himself, took them on a picnic where the Teselecta was shot by River's younger self. Amy, Rory and River went to a cafe to find a version of the Eleventh Doctor two hundred years younger than the one inside the Teselecta . ( TV : The Impossible Astronaut , The Wedding of River Song ) \nRiver secretly revisited her childhood when she accompanied her parents, the Eleventh Doctor, and Canton Everett Delaware III to Florida on 8 April 1969 to find the little girl who kept ringing Richard Nixon . Adhering to the Doctor's rule against \"spoilers\" which could collapse time, she feigned ignorance of her childhood self's identity. The only information she gave the Doctor about her old spacesuit was that which she could have reasonably determined by her inspection of it and she offered Amy and Canton no forewarning about what they would find in her old orphanage. Any knowledge she may have retained about the Silence she kept to herself. ( TV : The Impossible Astronaut ) River after killing a room full of the Silence.. ( TV : Day of the Moon ) \nRiver, Amy, Rory, Canton, and the Doctor split up to investigate the Silence over the next three months. By July, River was in New York City . She showed her reliance upon and faith in the Doctor and his TARDIS being in the right place and time to rescue her as she dove backwards out of the 50th floor of a building and into the TARDIS' swimming pool. She helped the Doctor defeat the Silence by using their brainwashing of humanity against them, while making sure she did not meet her first incarnation. River killed all of the Silence who were holding her mother hostage. At her request, the Doctor returned her to Stormcage, where she kissed him. He was shocked and she realised that from his perspective, it was their first kiss. ( TV : Day of the Moon ) The opening of the Pandorica \nIn 5145 , the TARDIS rerouted a phone call for the Doctor from Winston Churchill to River. She escaped to warn the Doctor of a prophecy of the TARDIS exploding. She blackmailed a Time Agent 's vortex manipulator off Dorium Maldovar and stole a Vincent Van Gogh painting from Liz Ten showing the TARDIS exploding and space-time coordinates. She graffitied a diamond cliff at the dawn of time with the coordinates, then travelled to England in 102 AD to meet the Eleventh Doctor and Amy. The Pandorica lay under Stonehenge , transmitting a signal to summon an alliance of the Doctor's enemies. The Doctor got them to back off and sent River to fetch the TARDIS. Instead, it took her to Amy's house on 26 June 2010 . When River told him the date, the Doctor realised the TARDIS was about to explode and told her to escape. ( TV : The Pandorica Opens ) Unable to leave, she was trapped in a time loop of the first moments of the explosion. ( TV : The Pandorica Opens / The Big Bang ) The Doctor rescued her in 1996 , told her his plan to use the Pandorica's restoration field to reverse the Total Event Collapse of the universe and was shot by a stone Dalek . River told the Dalek to look in its data banks for her, taunted it into begging for mercy, then killed it. \nAfter the Doctor had restored the universe by erasing himself, River left her now blank diary at her parents' wedding so Amy could remember him back into existence. After a brief conversation about her marital status and identity, River told the Doctor he was \"going to find out very soon now and I'm sorry, because that's when everything changes\", and left him wondering. ( TV : The Big Bang ) Temporal anomalies and the Eternity Clock River realises that her timeline is being rewritten. ( GAME : The Eternity Clock ) \nIn 5145 , River escaped from her cell in the Stormcage Containment Facility using her hallucinogenic lipstick, after receiving a phone call saying that the Doctor needed her help. She located her vortex manipulator and used it to travel to London in 2012 where she rescued her stranded husband. \nShe helped the Doctor fight off Cybermen , Daleks , Silents , and Silurians in different eras of London ; each had a piece of the fabled Eternity Clock to fuel their plans against humanity. She and the Doctor collected the pieces and brought them back to the TARDIS, which was at the heart of a temporal storm being caused by the Eternity Clock pieces trying to pull themselves together. \nRiver discovered, much to her shock, that there was an entry about the clock in her diary that she hadn't written; the Doctor explained that it was due to the temporal anomalies the clock was causing to time. No sooner had this been explained, the clock began tracking all fixed points in time and began attempting to rewrite them. Adding to the insanity, the TARDIS was towed away with them inside for the ride. ( GAME : The Eternity Clock ) The Crash of the Byzantium \nRiver was put in Father Octavian 's custody in the 51st century for a mission to try to earn her pardon. She infiltrated the Galaxy class Byzantium to find its Home Box , into which she carved \"Hello Sweetie\" in Old High Gallifreyan and her temporal coordinates. This attracted the Doctor's attention twelve thousand years later , leading Amy (who at this point in time had not met River before) and the Doctor to her and Alfava Metraxis . ( TV : The Time of Angels ) They defeated an army of Weeping Angels who had awakened in the planet's Maze of the Dead . She hinted they would meet again by the opening of the Pandorica. ( TV : Flesh and Stone ) \nFollowing this adventure, she visited Amy and Rory after they witnessed the Doctor's \"death\" in Utah and exposed some of the truth behind her many lies to her parents. ( TV : The Wedding of River Song ) A pardoned woman \nRiver was later pardoned and released from the Stormcage Containment Facility after it was discovered that there was no evidence of the man she had murdered having ever existed. This was due to the Doctor erasing himself from all databases as part of his return to the shadows. As a result of this, she returned to Archaeology and became a professor. ( TV : The Angels Take Manhattan ) \nAt some point, River had had an augmented lifespan, and eventually reached 200 years of age. She mentioned it was a \"long story\". ( TV : The Husbands of River Song ) Investigating the Weeping Angels \nRiver arrived in 1938 New York City via her vortex manipulator ( TV : The Angels Take Manhattan ) and set up the Angel Detective Agency where she was the sole employee, investigating the Weeping Angels ' invasion of New York. During this time she went by the alias \"Melody Malone.\" She was there for at least a month before a man named Rock Railton hired her to investigate what he feared to be a murder plot against him involving \"the kiss of an angel.\" The following day, while attending a Starlight Studios party, she encountered an old man claiming to be Rock Railton, but believed him to a bum. When she encountered the man she recognised as Rock, he had no memory of their meeting in her office the previous day. \nAfter dealing with two thugs that were hired to kill her, River returned to her office only to receive a call from head of Starlight Studios, Max Kliener . She agreed to meet him at his studio the next afternoon, where she was reintroduced to Rock, who claimed to remember their prior meeting. However, River knew he was lying when she asked about giving him coffee and he pretended to remember this although it never happened. She also noted that Giddy Semestre , Rock's co-star, also did not remember meeting her the day before at the party. \nMax then led River down a block from the main studio and revealed to her a room full of giant bell jars filled with what appeared to be clones of Rock Railton, Giddy Semestre, and of Max's bodyguard, Hank Sissy . Max explained that they were not clones so much as everyday people who had had their flesh redistributed in their bodies to make them look identical to their template bodies. To do this, he had used \"the kiss of an angel.\" The duplicates did not live very long, however, and were in fact growing old and dying out faster and faster because the Weeping Angel he was using to create his duplicates was growing stronger and therefore absorbing more and more of the victims' energy. Max planned to transform River into a copy of Giddy Semestre, but River kissed him using her hallucinogenic lipstick and managed to escape by killing the Hank copies and pushing Max into the arms of his Weeping Angel, who kissed him and turned him to dust. \nAs River was reversing the process to turn the other transformed victims back into themselves and escort them to safety, she was unaware that the Weeping Angel was being stolen from behind the curtain it was sitting behind via an escape hole that had been cut into the wall. She returned in time to see a van speeding off, presumably with the Angel inside. ( PROSE : The Angel's Kiss: A Melody Malone Mystery ) River in New York City on 3 April 1938 . ( TV : The Angels Take Manhattan ) \nAfter River's run-in with Max Kliener and his Angel, River met her husband in Manhattan, along with her parents. Rory was sent back in time to 1938 New York City by one of the Angels and met River. Amy and the Doctor had difficulty following him since all the time energy the Angels had consumed made time travel difficult. With the help of a Chinese vase as \"landing lights\", they managed to get through but found River trapped in the grip of one of the Angels; she had to break her wrist to escape and the Doctor used up some of his regeneration energy to fix it. Rory was locked in a cellar with a group of baby Weeping Angels but instead of sending him back in time, they just sent him to Winter Quay . When River, Amy and the Doctor found Rory, they also found an older version of him, dying in a bed. After that they heard loud thumps, made by the Statue of Liberty , which had become a Weeping Angel. \nWith the Angels closing in, River, her husband and her parents were forced to flee towards the roof and got separated on the way up. The Statue of Liberty was waiting for them and Rory and Amy decided to sacrifice themselves to create a paradox which would poison the Angels food source and kill them. River and the Doctor watched in horror as Amy and Rory threw themselves off the roof, and the paradox killed all the Angels except one, who somehow managed to survive. \nThe group found themselves in a graveyard that had a gravestone with Rory's name on it. As they were preparing to leave, a surviving Weeping Angel ambushed them and sent Rory back in time. Because of the paradox, and all the poisoned time energy, the Doctor couldn't take the TARDIS to find him. Amy decided to allow the Angel to touch her so that she could be with Rory. After a tearful goodbye to River and the Doctor, Amy turned away from the Angel and allowed it to touch her so that she could live with Rory for the rest of her life. \nThe devastated Doctor asked River to travel with him. River said she would go with him anywhere, but \"not all the time\", as there was \"only room for one psychopath\" on the TARDIS. Under the name \"Melody Malone\", River went upstairs to write the book that led the Doctor to 1930s New York and said that she would get Amy to write the afterword when she sent it to her for publishing, in hopes that the Doctor would listen to Amy. ( TV : The Angels Take Manhattan ) Meeting the Eleven on Syra \nRiver summoned the Eighth Doctor to Syra to stop the Eleven . Surprised that she had recruited the wrong Doctor, she called herself \"Melody Malone\" and teamed up with his companion, Helen Sinclair .

When she spotted that the Eighth Doctor was there she vanished. She then went to Prague Castle where Liv was and investigated the strange going ons at the forest. She realised that the metal deposits came from Syra and theorised that they came here on the outsides of The Eleven's TARDIS . ( AUDIO : The Eighth Piece ) \nRiver then took Helen from Rome in 2016 before Helen went to the exhibition, and got her back there as she was a much better driver than the Doctor. She took her to 17th century France to do some archaeology. She then took Helen on a trip through time to find a map to the Eighth piece, stealing pieces of art across time which lead her to the Vatican in the 1960s . She then rescued Liv from a burning building and took her to Rome. After the Doctor was affected by the Doomsday Chronometer she took him to the Clocksmith's TARDIS and rescued him from the collapsing building. She then aggreed to help the Doctor in his mission.

When they discovered that there were Chancellery Guards murdering the survivors of the cataclism. ( AUDIO : The Crucible of Souls ) Meeting the Twelfth Doctor \nRiver learned that King Hydroflax had the Halassi Androvar diamond embedded in his head. She purported to have married him as part of a plan to retrieve it. For this reason, she joked that she had actually married the diamond itself. At around the same time, she also claimed to have married her assistant Ramone . \nRiver planned to use a surgeon to remove the diamond. She sent her assistant Nardole to bring the surgeon to her but Nardole inadvertently found the Twelfth Doctor and brought him to River by mistake. River did not recognise the Doctor in this incarnation. River brought the Doctor to Hydroflax, as part of a ruse to steal the diamond from his head. The Doctor repeatedly tried to tell her who he was, but she did not understand what he was saying. Hydroflax revealed himself to be a cyborg and discovered her deception, removing his own head in the process. River and the Doctor snatched the head and escaped via teleport to a location near the TARDIS. River discovered the TARDIS and decided to take it for a ride without the Doctor's knowledge, indicating she had done it before. After a brief scuffle which trapped Hydroflax's body in the TARDIS with them, River and the Doctor piloted the TARDIS to the Harmony and Redemption . \nAboard the ship, with Hydroflax's body sealed in a cargo hold, River attempted to sell the diamond-studded head. Eventually, Scratch arrived to buy the diamond, but then revealed himself and every other person in the restaurant to be Hydroflax devotees. A fight ensued, during which Hydroflax's head was ultimately vaporised by the body. To buy time by \"keeping them talking\", River claimed to Hydroflax's body that while she loved the Doctor, the Doctor didn't love her back, and he wouldn't be stupid or sentimental enough to come rescue her. River then realised who the Doctor was, and quickly revealed to him that a meteor storm was about to strike the ship and kill everyone and she planned her position perfectly. As the storm struck the ship, the floor broke under River and the Doctor, dropping them to a lower floor, and breaking the standoff. \nThe ship descended, with River and the Doctor unable to bring it under control. As they argued about who would save the ship from crashing into the planet Darillium , they realised they were seconds from crashing and fled into the TARDIS. The TARDIS shielded them from the crash, but the impact knocked out River.
