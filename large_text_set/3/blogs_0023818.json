Tapping into her network of past and current LPGA stars, people such as Juli Inkster, Stacy Lewis and Cheyenne Woods, King has taken annual trips to Africa and worked to give clean water and improved living conditions to 220 villages. \nBut there’s more work to do. On World Water Day, which is Wednesday, King will announce her personal commitment of $1.3 million toward a goal of raising $10 million to continue the work needed to be done. \nIn a photo from the 2007 Solheim Cup, U.S. team captain Betsy King watches play in Halmstad, Sweden. (Photo: Scott Halleran, Getty Images) \nThere are 663 million people in the world that lack access to clean water; that’s a little more than twice the population of the United States. \nRELATED: LPGA golfers help bring clean water to Zambian villages \n“If there was just one thing you could do that would really change the world it would be to bring clean water to everyone,” said King, who is donating $100,000 a year for the next 10 years. “If the last 10% of the world had access to clean water, we would save nearly 1,000 kids’ lives every day. Girls would miss school 50% less often and women would have more economic opportunities because of time saved not having to walk for water.” \nGolf Fore Africa is partnering with World Vision to end the global water crisis by 2030. Golf Fore Africa has committed to raise $10 million over the next five years, which would provide clean water to 200,000 people in the Western Province of Zambia. \nTo learn more and donate to Golf Fore Africa, visit golfforeafrica.org 101 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T09:25:06.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
