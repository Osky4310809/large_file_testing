The team wanted him out. The manager, with the greatest reluctance, wanted him out. And as much as we didn't want him out, you can't go against the consensus of the team and manager.\" \nSullivan also revealed that negotiating the deal with Marseille had not been as smooth a process as he hoped. \n\"[Marseille] were very difficult to deal with,\" he added. \"They're lucky we accepted the £25m. I think he's worth more than that. The player's surrendered his January wages, which is another four or five hundred thousand so you get that there. \nArsenal to face Sutton United in FA Cup \n\"There's a little bit of dignity we got with that. That was a deal breaker to us. Our attitude was 'you've refused to play' - why should you get paid?\" \nWest Ham host Manchester City in their return to Premier League action at the London Stadium on Wednesday night.
