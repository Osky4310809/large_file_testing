As a sneaker line inspired by the art, influences, and sheer style of SUPRA team skater Chad Muska, the Skytop is one of the most recognizable silhouettes in the wider world of footwear. Fortunately, its forward-thinking design couples the best of sport with SUPRA’s history in skate to forge a sneaker that’s worth of carrying the Skytop name.\nWith a plan to fuse classic skateboarding details with the technical details found on a modern-day running shoe, the Skytop V meets the demands of skateboarders who aren’t willing to sacrifice style when looking for substance.\nAs the hybrid design implies, wearers can expect this recently unveiled Skytop to embody the best of both worlds. A four-part, encased rubber EVA midsole runs along the full length of the shoe, which pairs neatly with a cement cupsole construction. The overall effect improves flex, shock absorption and durability. Speaking of durability, the Skytop V also boasts a TUF sandwich mesh vamp—a detail which is 20 times stronger than suede with increased wear endurance and breathability.\nThe athletic influences are found throughout the shoe, but are especially prevalent when you notice the neoprene and Lyrcra-based bootie, that makes up the shoe’s midtop design. But while the Skytop V is technically sporty, SUPRA is still focused on shoes that can handle the rigors of riding. Skate-smart touches are delivered via the multi-piece, tread pattern rubber outsole, paired with an external toe wrap for stronger grip and stability respectively.\n“I really wanted to push the envelope on what’s considered a skateable shoe,” explained Muska in a press release. “The [Skytop] V’s are definitely disruptive in the best ways possible.”\nTo get a feel for the new Skytop silhouette, we’ve showcased the SUPRA model both on-foot and on-board. Scope the video above, and get ready for the revolutionary Skytop V—hitting Zumiez and SUPRA retailers around the globe today.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T19:11:27.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
