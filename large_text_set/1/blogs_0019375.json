Now Wayne becomes a legend of Manchester United.\" \nNike have also got in on the act, creating a custom pair of boots for one of their biggest clients – the Hypervenom WR250. \nWhile able to rest a little easier now that he has successfully chased down a target which had been hanging over him for some time, United still need Rooney to deliver over the coming weeks and months. \nThey remain outside of the Premier League’s top four at present, with four points separating them from the Champions League spots. \nMourinho’s men also have the second leg of an EFL Cup semi-final clash with Hull City approaching on Thursday, a FA Cup fourth round tie with Wigan on Sunday and a last-32 showdown with Saint Etienne to come in the Europa League in February.
