CBS Sports saw it going the other way with Brunson winning the bout 30-27 while controlling each round. \nSilva was incredibly emotional after the fight, breaking down immediately after his name was announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T12:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:04:35.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
