This new jailbreak solution will apparently not require any 7-day resigning of the jailbreak: “as solution to the 7 days thing, jbme102 may become a thing when 10.3 gets released” . \nHe further went on to confirm that he was in fact the “mystery man” behind Saurik’s now-failed Cydia Extender tool. \nAs you may already know by now, Cydia Extender was originally supposed to bring a solution for 7-day signing issue on IPA-based semi-tethered jailbreaks when installing through Cydia Impactor, only for Saurik and Luca to later realize that it worked with paid developer accounts only: “I was saurik’s “mistery man” for his thing, but didn’t find time to pull it off. Now I have time and 1day, so I’d rather do it jbme style.” \nIt’s currently unknown as to why is Luca waiting for Apple to drop iOS 10.3 to public before releasing jbme102. Maybe because he wants to see if Apple will patch the exploit or not in final version of iOS 10.3 before making it public? \nSpeaking of exploits, it’s likely that jbme102, if ever released, will be using an exploit which Luca only recently wrote for 1day WebKit: “Wrote an exploit for a WebKit 1day. And for f*ck’s sake PS4 unaffected because WebKit is too old.” \nThe type of devices supported by this new jailbreak is anybody’s guess at this point, but if Luca’s most recent yalu102 jailbreak is anything to go by, it is likely that most, if not all, 64-bit iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices will be supported by this jailbreak running iOS 10.2 firmware. \nAs always has been the case though, we will keep you updated as and when we get to know more about this jailbreak, including the time it drops for public consumption.
