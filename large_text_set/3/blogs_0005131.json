As there is a confirmed natural cause of death, being Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Myocarditis and Fatty Liver, the investigation is being discontinued and there is no need for an inquest or any further enquiries.\" Photos â€” Fadi Fawaz (@fadifawaz) March 7, 2017 \n\"No further updates will be provided and the family requests the media and public respect their privacy,\" it continued. \nAfter news of the Wham! singer's untimely passing broke in late 2016, an initial autopsy proved inconclusive. In the aftermath of George Michael's death, tweets posted to Fawaz's account claimed the 53-year-old attempted suicide on multiple occasions and wanted to die. Fawaz maintained his Twitter had been hacked, but a family member of Michael's cast doubt on their relationship. \n\"One thing is for sure this was not an act of suicide,\" Michael's cousin Andros Georgiou shared on F acebook in mid-January. \"If I was around this would never [have] happened and I have to live with that the rest of my life...I have to pray that the police come to the conclusion I have and justice will be served.\" \nSince his death, Michael has received several tributes from artists including Chris Martin , longtime friend Elton John and Adele .
