The trailer has just been released online, and I’m bowled over by how good it looks. Such an interesting concept– absolutely love! \nThe film stars Anushka, Suraj Sharma, Diljit Dosanjh and Anshai Lal and will release on March 24th. SO excited for this! 20", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T12:03:53.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
