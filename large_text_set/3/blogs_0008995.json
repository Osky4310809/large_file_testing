Experts suspect climate change and the related change in ice flows and currents are likely driving the phenomenon.\n“It’s a public safety concern,” said Jonathon Solomon, grand chief of the Mushkegowuk Tribal Council, which represents several Cree First Nations in the region.\n“You see the changes … in the travel patterns of bears. They’re coming inland. Ten years ago, there might’ve been a rare one, but not the way things have been (recently).”\nIn response, the council is sponsoring a workshop this week in Fort Albany First Nation to give Mushkegowuk environmental stewards advice on how to deal with future polar bear encounters.\nRelated The polar bears are fine: Certain populations coping with a warming Arctic better than expected Polar bears may only be able to survive in Canada’s Arctic islands and north Greenland as ice melts: report Russian scientists ‘besieged’ by 10 polar bears circling their remote Arctic island research station The workshop is being administered by Karen Cummings, manager of the Polar Bear Habitat, a polar bear reserve in Cochrane, Ont. She said Monday she was aware of at least eight polar bear encounters since December 2015 in places like Moose Factory, Kashechewan and Attawapiskat — all places that rarely see polar bears.\n“No one has a crystal ball. No one knows if it’ll happen again. But we suspect it will,” she said by phone as she was making her way up the winter ice road to Fort Albany.\nCummings said she and safety consultant Andy McMullen of BearWise will be giving advice to local residents on ways to deter polar bears from encroaching on communities — including the use of bangers, flares and rubber bullets — and how to safely lead them out of town.\nIn the event bears keep returning, residents will also get instruction in how to live-trap bears. Cummings was hauling a three-metre-long culvert trap on a trailer Monday to distribute to the community. Four more are being built, she said.\nLeslie Pine, a resident of Moose Factory at the south end of James Bay, recalled how he, his wife and mother-in-law watched with amazement in December 2015 as a polar bear picked through pieces of trash at the local dump.\nLeslie Pine A young and malnourished polar bear is spotted on a garbage dump in Moose Factory, Ont., in December 2015. It was put down by local police. The “poor bear,” he said, hardly had any fat on it. “He looked pretty skinny and sick-looking. He was a really young bear. It was probably his first year being away from his mother,” he said.\n“It was so rare for a polar bear to come this far down for food.”\nAfter consulting with the local band council and chief, police shot and killed the bear.\nThe bear was handled respectfully and its skull, bones and claws were used for ceremonial purposes, Pine said.\nBrandon Spence, a volunteer firefighter in Kashechewan, described to the CBC last July a tense encounter with a polar bear roaming the streets in his community.\nSpence parked his truck on one side of the road, while police parked on the other side.\n“It started to come towards us,” he recalled. “The police started to play their sirens and lights. So the bear stopped and turned around, and went back to the school portables … The bear was pushing the fence for a good five or 10 minutes, knocked the fence down and took off.”\nThe bear returned the next day and was shot by police. After the bear was blessed, it was eaten by locals, he said.\nKaren Cummings, Polar Bear Habitat A bear trap is delivered to Fort Albany First Nation Monday as part of a workshop for residents on how to deal with polar bear encounters. The polar bears that have been spotted in these James Bay communities belong to the Southern Hudson Bay sub-population, said Brandon Laforest, a senior specialist in Arctic species and ecosystems with the World Wildlife Fund-Canada.\nWhile the sub-population’s numbers have been stable, the bears have been getting thinner, Laforest said. With diminishing sea ice, the bears have been spending more time on land, away from their primary food source — seals.\nSome bears will ride the ice as long as they can in search of marine mammals, which could take them further south than they intended, he said.\nThe conflict between polar bears and residential communities has been growing not only in Canada but in Alaska, Greenland and Russia, he added.\nThis points to the need for communities to make sure their landfills are properly fenced in and for residents to properly store their garbage, a spokeswoman for Ontario’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry said Monday.\n“Public safety is a priority. As a last resort, black bears and polar bears can also be shot in defence of property,” she said.\n– With files from The Canadian Press \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:10:17.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
