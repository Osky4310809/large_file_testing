Even the most robust estimates fell some 25 percent short of the realized private sector employment gains. January was the fastest pace of job growth since June of last year. \nCan’t argue with that. \nThings are looking up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:40:58.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
