Not only did he lose his dream girl Nicki Minaj , but the world also saw him slip and fall down the stairs at his mom’s house like a clumsy fool. Watch out for the ice! Meek Mill slips and falls down the stairs To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nOn top of that , most people have already forgotten about his last album DC4 . The man needs a miracle! \nThat’s precisely why I was saddened to hear Meek Mill has taken yet another loss. This time, however, he was in complete control of his own fate. \nIn a recent video shared on social media by Meek Mill himself, the 29-year-old Philadelphia-born rapper forces a homeless man to perform pushups in exchange for a $20 bill. \nKeep in mind, Meek Mill is one of those rappers who still thinks fanning out cash in Instagram selfies is cool. You’d think he’d be grateful for his own success as a recording artist and just do a good deed for the homeless… NOPE. Giphy \nIt turns out Meek had another (disgusting) idea in mind: make the homeless man work for it. \nOf course, Meek must’ve forgotten that he is a well-known celebrity. The internet quickly exploded with criticism regarding the rapper’s tasteless actions, and people are PISSED. Here’s the disgusting video of Meek Mill forcing a homeless man to do pushups for money. WTF was he even thinking?! Here you go, Meek… You deserve it. Twitter It didn’t take long before Twitter erupted to call him out. Meek Mill told a homeless guy \"We not giving out free money\" and then made him do push ups for $20. I never respected him and never will now He might’ve lost whatever was left of his fanbase after that stunt! Meek Mill been trash. Telling a homeless person to do push ups for $ is so disgusting. \n— the Moon. (@ChazieHamilton) February 26, 2017 What if fans made Meek do pushups for song plays?! Meek Mill made a homeless dude do pushups for $20? Meek should have to do twice that for a download. \n— Jordan Carlos (@jordancarlos) February 26, 2017 Tsk, tsk, tsk. Meek Mill is a disgrace 4making a homeless man do 20 pushups for $20. If your going to give than don't degrade & 20 is nothin when your rich It’s almost like he forgot where he came from or something. Meek Mill got homeless people doing push-ups for money smfh cmon MeekDid Ross make you do push-ups before he signed yo ass @MeekMill ? \n— Tommie Belljr (@T__Rollie) February 25, 2017 He had TWO options… Meek mill really made a homeless man do pushups for money Give the man money or fuck off there are literally two easy options \n— high blood pressure (@juvsx) February 25, 2017 \nDespite his most recent demeaning stunt, it must be noted Meek Mill has done charity work with several youth organizations that aim to provide resources for the less fortunate. \nUnfortunately for the “Litty” rapper, forcing a homeless person to do pushups for $20 will overshadow ALL of his past work with those charity organizations.
