That’s not a big deal. It really isn’t a big deal.” \nLimbaugh said it was fine for Flynn to “get out of the way” if he lied to Vice President Mike Pence , he still didn’t understand why the media was asking what Trump knew about Flynn’s calls and when he knew it. \nThis segued into the conservative radio host then tying Flynn to the Obama Administration due to Flynn being the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama and saying that this was a “political assassination” set up by the former administration. He also explained that the media was part of this strategy. \n“The media’s gonna try as hard as they can not to let go of this, because now they’ve got their scalp,” he bellowed. “They think they have blood in the water, they’ve got a scalp and they think they can get another and then another and then another and then another until finally they get Trump.” \nYou can listen to Limbaugh’s entire theory about the plot against Trump above. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T21:30:32.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
