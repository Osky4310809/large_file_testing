Well, it sounds like we shouldn’t have worried. The new trailer features the actress giving voice to one of the film’s most famous tunes — the movie’s opening number. \nAlong with Watson’s melodic musings, we also get a better glimpse of the animated characters including Mrs. Potts, Chip, Lumiere and Cogsworth and a few scenes of Watson giving us serious Sound of Music vibes as she belts it out on the side of a mountain while wearing a frilly blue frock. \nThe one thing missing in all this? More scenes of Luke Evans as the dastardly Gaston and Josh Gad as his lovable crony Le Fou. Those two deserve their own evil buddy comedy flick. Get on it Disney.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:44:38.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
