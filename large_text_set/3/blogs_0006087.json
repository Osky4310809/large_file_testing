Good for them! tjacks7 says: Mar 9, 2017 5:58 PM \nAll those good moves the browns made are about to be washed down the drain for a guy who has played about 10 quarters in the NFL. You can‚Äôt take the browns out of the browns. packmangamble says: Mar 9, 2017 5:58 PM \nDon‚Äôt be stupid and give away a first and a second for a QB who has hardly played any football. Stupid is as stupid does!! pats14 says: Mar 9, 2017 5:58 PM \nKnowing how Bill Belichick thinks, Pats will probably keep Garoppolo and get two #1‚Äôs and two #2‚Äôs for Brady next year. Chess vs checkers. Mar 9, 2017 5:58 PM \nBB is a genius. Unreal. \nFare thee well, paisano. rob471773 says: Mar 9, 2017 5:59 PM \nCleveland is desperate, as the should be. If they really think Jimmy is their guy, you can‚Äôt knock them for pulling out all stops to go and get him. \nIt‚Äôs going to take the 12th overall pick plus a future 1st rounder OR the 12th overall pick plus a 2nd rounder this year and a second rounder next year. rugolin says: Mar 9, 2017 6:01 PM \nThe Browns are doing all this wheeling and dealing to only get 2 career back up Quarterbacks. Seriously. haslamdrinkshisownpee says: Mar 9, 2017 6:02 PM \nIs he healthy yet after these grueling two games he finished in 3 years? Great day until‚Ä¶..now. He has so much special ability, every team passed on him twice 3 years ago. tjacks7 says: Mar 9, 2017 6:05 PM \nThe more likely scenario is that the Pats trade Jimmy for picks. Trade those picks for player(s) like the Saints WR. Bill and Brady both know they only have a few years left and then they really don‚Äôt care about the Pats drifting back to mediocrity when they leave. They‚Äôre all in for now. chitowngronk says: Mar 9, 2017 6:05 PM \nBrilliant on the Brown‚Äôs front office staff. Used their cap space to get a 2nd and a team out of a bind. \nWish the Bears with all of their cap space had this foresight and a shot at JG. Instead we go from Cutler to Mike effing Glennon carrcoreyr87 says: Mar 9, 2017 6:06 PM \nGaroppolo to the Browns for the #1 overall will be Bellichek‚Äôs revenge on Cleveland for firing him way back when! phillypcp says: Mar 9, 2017 6:06 PM \nAt least they added some talent to the o-line first. They‚Äôre being smart at least minnesotablizzard says: Mar 9, 2017 6:08 PM \nThis would be the most Browns thing ever. Jimmy should refuse to play in Cleveland cuz he‚Äôs going to suck something terrible there. Stay behind Brady, when the time comes you will have a successful team and franchise around you. Cleveland will ruin you. harrisonhits2 says: Mar 9, 2017 6:08 PM \n‚ÄúSaw the report that they want #1 overall for garoppolo. Goodell would shut the patriots down if they somehow got garrett.‚Äù \nLol if the Pats somehow manage to fleece the top pick out of the Browns, Goodell will be seen shortly thereafter being led out of NFL HQ in little white straightjacket after having started gnawing off his own extremities. \nImagine the looks on Goodell‚Äôs, Mara‚Äôs, Irsay‚Äôs, Johnson‚Äôs, Bisciotti‚Äôs and several other owner‚Äôs faces. Can‚Äôt even imagine the vast rages that would be taken out on everyone around them. \nI can‚Äôt think of a Super Bowl winner that ever managed to get ahold of the top pick the following offseason. jscruisen says: Mar 9, 2017 6:08 PM \nWorse case scenario, the Brown‚Äôs can package all those picks next year to move up to pick #1 where the QB class is suppose to be much better than this year. They can keep Osweiler this year, cut RGIII. This would save $8mil from RGIII and cut in half the $16mil they acquired with Osweiler. Thus a 2nd round pick next year and Osweiler for $8mil. Pretty smart I think and I‚Äôm not a Sasha fan! pastabelly says: Mar 9, 2017 6:08 PM \nNot sure why all the hate on Garoppolo. He was highly rated coming out of college and has three years of being trained on an NFL level. He also looked great when he was in. I went to that Miami game and I was convinced that Jimmy‚Äôs got the arm and the head to be a great one. Belichick really likes him, but I guess many here know talent better than Belichick. If Bill keeps him, that tells you all you need to know about how good this kid is. hoyerthedestroyer says: Mar 9, 2017 6:09 PM \nMary Kay has no insight. The question two months ago was if Jimmy was even worth a 1st rounder. Then since Celeand had a #12, that was the new standard. Now it‚Äôs #12 and some 2nds might get it done. She just makes more stuff up as she goes. All for an unknown. D. Carter 1906 says: Mar 9, 2017 6:09 PM \nThe Pats are taking Osweiler, with a reworked contract, Browns eat $8 million of it, plus they get (2) 2018 Browns 2nd round picks and 2018 3rd round pick! Book it! laukkanen5 says: Mar 9, 2017 6:10 PM \ngreat‚Ä¶help fuel the Patriots next title runs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶cause we all know the Stains aren‚Äôt winning anything anytime soon Mar 9, 2017 6:10 PM \nA first and a second? \nLet‚Äôs resurrect all those annual predictable columns from the expert sports writers in Boston about what a terrible GM Belichick is ‚Äì yea you Borges and plenty others. \nThere is nothing to say that most of this year‚Äôs trades will work out. Never is. But Belichick knows he can‚Äôt stand pat and just pay up on the current roster to remain competitive long term under the salary cap. He has the guts to take his chances too early not too late! Mar 9, 2017 6:11 PM \nMatt Cassel part 2 Mar 9, 2017 6:11 PM \nThe pats don‚Äôt rebuild, they reload. \nSpeaking of reload, stock up on tears haters. mistrezzrachael says: Mar 9, 2017 6:11 PM \nBrowns #1 & #33‚Ä¶and maybe 1 other. \nPlus, Jimmy G would come back and sign w/NE next season justintuckrule says: Mar 9, 2017 6:12 PM \nKevin Costner killing it in the Browns F.O. stiffmcgriff says: Mar 9, 2017 6:12 PM \nIf ever given the reins to start, Garoppolo will become Osweiler 2.0. \nONLY the Browns would give up multiple 1‚Äôs & 2‚Äôs for an UNPROVEN QB. He‚Äôs no Tom Brady. \nGaroppolo ‚Äì 63-94 67% 690YDS 5TD 0INT Osweiler ‚Äì 488-815 59.9% 5,083 26TD 22INT \nEventually in Cleveland, Garoppolo will turn into Crappolo. deneb1973 says: Mar 9, 2017 6:13 PM \nIf the reports are to be believed, NE gets the best corner on the market, a replacement for Bennett via trade, Harmon is staying AND they still have Garoppolo and Brissett. Browns fans complain that the team is trading for a guy with 10 quarters of first team experience; I guess they would rather have a rookie who has NO NFL experience (and may not have ever taken a snap from center) at a time when 50% of the first round QBs fail. The Browns can draw even with the Steelers and ahead of Cincinnati if they bring in a winner like Garoppolo ‚Äì as time will tell ‚Äì but perhaps Garoppolo will make his point in NE. Those who object remember your objections when Garoppolo wins his first SB as the starting QB for NE.
