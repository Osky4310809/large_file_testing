As you’d expect, they don’t reveal anything new about the handset. In fact, they actually corroborate everything we’ve heard in the past, including that that it’ll sport on-screen navigation keys and a 6.2-inch panel. \nOther notable purported specifications include a Snapdragon 835 octa-core CPU, a 12MP rear-facing camera, an 8MP selfie shooter and a 3,500mAh battery. The 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 , on the other hand, will sport a 3,000mAh cell. Both handsets are expected to ship running the latest build of Android 7.0 Nougat skinned with Samsung Experience and will have the firm’s recently-announced Bixby virtual assistant on board. \nWe should note, however, that the shots of the packaging are slightly suspicious. Notice how it refers to a ‘Micro USB Connector?’ Well, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are set to feature a USB Type-C port. There’s a good chance it could be highlighting that there’s some form of adaptor in the box, though. Just something to bear in mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:07:13.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
