This excerpt from the documentary is about the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico. In 2014, radioactive waste spilled out from the plant during an accident. The facility has just now begun to accept nuclear waste deposits again . Moss and Galisonâ€™s film contains graphic novel and sci-fi elements, as they try to imagine a world thousands of years from now where this waste still exists. You can stream the full documentary on the PBS website until February 8, 2016.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:53:02.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
