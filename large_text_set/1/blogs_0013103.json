When two men approached her, she said, she jumped up, pointed to her subway seat and yelled, \"You're sitting on George!\" and then repeated, \"You're sitting on George!\" pretending to be crazy. \nTarighi, a third-degree black belt in Kenpo karate, said improvisation is often the name of the game if someone gets too close. \nShe said besides faking \"crazy,\" one can also pretend to have an asthma attack or use other methods to draw the attention of others or deflect the attention of a predator. \nBut if possible, she said, the first thing anyone should do is to \"get the hell out of there.\" If that can't be done, she said, they need to inflict harm. \"The one who creates the injury is the one who walks away.\" \nParticipants laughed as they practiced techniques such as \"the finger,\" which involves pushing two fingers against the lower section of an attacker's throat, or kneeing someone in the groin. \nTarighi encouraged them to get over the fear of using physical force. \n\"If people are more comfortable with it, they'll be less afraid to use it,\" she said. \nPassalacqua and Kmetz said the class left them in a better spot. \n\"I feel more empowered,\" Kmetz said. \"If I were to get into a situation, I feel like I would have more options.\" Passalacqua agreed: \"I feel way more comfortable.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T04:36:40.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
