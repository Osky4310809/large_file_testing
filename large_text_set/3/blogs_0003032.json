Jurgen Klopp gives his views on Liverpool's rollercoaster ride of a season. \nLiverpool's 3-1 win against Arsenal last Saturday was the latest chapter in the story of England's strangest fixture. \nGeorginio Wijnaldum raced 60 yards to clinically slide home the clinching goal in injury time, the 64th scored in a Liverpool-Arsenal game at Anfield in just over 10 years. \nThat includes 11 league games and three cup matches, averaging almost five goals a game. Given the clubs' fierce rivalry, their involvement at the top of the Premier League and even a Champions League clash, the goals rate is bizarre over such a long period. \nThe sequence began January 2007, with two cup ties in a week. The Londoners emerged victorious in both, the second a 6-3 win. Julio Baptista scored four times for Arsenal but did hardly anything else for them afterwards. It was not to be an isolated occurrence. Then there was the Champions League quarterfinal in 2008, with the Reds emerging victorious. The 4-2 second leg win saw shifts and turns in fortune, due to the away goals rule. That night another Dutchman, Ryan Babel, raced almost the length of the pitch to slot home the injury time decider. \nA year later, there was another ride on the rollercoaster with Liverpool's title hopes taking a dent after a 4-4 draw against the same opposition. Again, an Arsenal player scored four goals -- this time Andrey Arshavin, would not hit such heights after that, much in the same way Baptista fizzled out. \nAfter a brief lull in the craziness, it re-emerged with the Reds' famous 5-1 win in February 2014. Arsenal were top of the league at the time with the second best defence, but were 4-0 down after 20 minutes in an opening storm that Liverpool fans will never forget. \nGiven the fixture's recent record, 3-1 doesn't seem to fit with the highs and lows of recent seasons, but it had its peculiarities too. \nLiverpool's form is bewildering, capable of trawling the depths with a 3-1 defeat at Leicester where few players came close to mediocre. \nNow they were excellent everywhere, their huge energy levels driving Arsenal back and forcing them into multiple errors. It was hard to believe this was the team that was so embarrassing at King Power five days earlier. \nAs for Arsenal, they started a huge clash against a rival for a Champions League spot without their best player, Alexis Sanchez. Arsene Wenger was already under pressure with Premier League and Champions League hopes in tatters, and few understood what he hoped to achieve -- although rumours of unrest emerged later. Liverpool showed their big game mentality once again by beating Arsenal 3-1. \nAt 2-0 down, the Chilean striker was called upon and within minutes had created two glorious chances, one converted by Danny Welbeck. Game on. Liverpool just about survived and even added a third to seal victory but once again both clubs' fans were put though the emotional wringer. \nAfterwards there was much discussion about why these sides weren't ever title-winning material despite providing rich entertainment over recent seasons. The problems lay squarely in defence, complacency and game management. Liverpool are on course to concede 40 or more goals in a league season for the seventh year running. \nThey were bound to struggle containing a side which belatedly featured one of the league's most gifted players, but there were times when they simply had no idea how to close out their victory and poured forward in search of more goals, no matter the cost. \nIncredibly entertaining of course, but in marked contrast to table toppers Chelsea who aren't exactly boring but know better how to close out their wins. \nLiverpool's erratic form also stems from squad weakness, with players knowing they can't be dropped because there simply isn't the talent available at the secondary level to threaten their place. \nIdeally, Jurgen Klopp wouldn't have to use Lucas Leiva nor Ragnar Klavan in defence so much. In fairness, Klavan played well on Saturday, but isn't really good enough for a team planning to win a title. \nThis all sounds depressing but conversely, football is entertainment after all and Klopp and Wenger should perhaps be thanked for ensuring fans are always excited and intrigued by their teams' efforts -- good or bad. \nAmbitious groups of fans will, however, question whether a little pragmatism could go a long way towards curing their club's ills. Balance is key. \nIt's worth remembering the dogmatic, disciplined Rafael Benitez couldn't ever rein in the Liverpool-Arsenal fixture. It seems to have a life of its own. Long may it continue, but Liverpool fans will be hoping for more efficiency in their other 37 league games next season. \nKlopp has to make such games the exception rather than the rule without losing anything of what makes this Liverpool team so exciting. It will be a tall order. \nSteven Kelly is one of ESPN FC's Liverpool bloggers.
