Not so much. With how much the Internet loves old Nokia phones such as the Nokia 3310, you'd understand why the new makers of the Nokia phone want to trade in on that. \nBut nostalgia as a business proposition is risky and to be honest, ridiculous. \nIf the market wanted phones never to evolve or change, Nokia and BlackBerry phones would still be the leading names in the industry. Trends, however, change. Technology moves. Rose-tinted glasses don't help. \nUnless you truly want to be a Luddite, dumbphones or relics have no place in the modern world besides in displays or the occasional feature . \nSometimes, even the smallest iterative feature will make a difference - take last year's proliferation of dual-cameras and the continued, and boggling, success of Casio's mega-expensive selfie digital cameras. \nWhat's the point of bringing back old phones if they're not going to be a massive hit and, most importantly, make a lot of money. \nI count myself in the tiny majority unimpressed by Xiaomi's Mi Mix: smaller bezels, so what? I want to be amazed. I want more than shiny glass backs, rounded edges and blurred backgrounds in photos. \nPhones have proved life-changing in poorer countries - allowing for microstransactions, purchases and sales while allowing communication with family members working overseas without prohibitive IDD call rates. \nI think we're past due for another innovation - a different sea change. We've seen phones get bigger, the death of flip phones, the emergence of app stores and one model in particular using a stylus as a selling point. \nSo I hope 2017 will be a bigger surprise instead of the small, though arguably significant updates of the last few years. I think just wanting to be amazed for once isn't that tall an order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:08:16.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
