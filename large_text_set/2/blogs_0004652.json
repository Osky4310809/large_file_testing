I felt that Willy should play,\" the City boss told reporters. \n\"Of course confidence is important but I still have the same confidence in Willy and Claudio, but I thought it was time to play with Willy. \n\"I'll choose depending on how I see them. \n\"[Bravo] is a huge professional. He is not a young guy – he has a lot of experience. \n\"One of the biggest qualities of Claudio is a strong personality. If he wasn't he couldn't play as Chile captain and win the Copa America; playing in teams like Barcelona where the pressure there is 1,000 times higher than here and play there without any problem.\" Pep has a fully fit squad at his disposal for Sunday! #cityvswans #mcfc https://t.co/hDylZjQBGP — Manchester City (@ManCity) February 3, 2017 \nSwansea head to Manchester buoyed by back-to-back wins over Liverpool and Southampton that have lifted them out of the relegation zone. \nGuardiola believes the influence of recently appointed head coach Paul Clement, formerly number two to Carlo Ancelotti at Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, is clearly evident and he expects a tough test. \nDo Leicester need to sack Ranieri to survive? \n\"I am really impressed. I saw the game against Liverpool and this morning I started to see the game against Southampton,\" he said. \n\"I am trying to discover the way we can attack them and, wow, I cannot find it. It is so complicated. \n\"When I see their games, I see his hands in his teams. They are so well organised, there is no space between the lines and no space in the middle. \n\"When you attack out wide they defend the box really well. They can go to [Fernando] Llorente with the long balls and they have quality players for the counter-attack. \n\"It will be a real tough, tough game. I think one of the toughest games we can expect until the end of the season will be on Sunday. \n\"Now they are in a good moment. They won in Anfield and against Southampton – not against normal teams.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:42:22.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
