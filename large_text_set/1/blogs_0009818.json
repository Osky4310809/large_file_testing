It’s a brand new year and it’s time to step up your game. 2016 you is gone. 2017 you is smarter, harder-working, and more efficient. 2017 you gets straight As. Here are five tips to step up your school game this semester. 1. Use your planner! \n(source) \nI can’t believe how many people don’t actually use their planners. Most schools give you one. If you lost it, go buy one for 2017. Write down EVERYTHING. Write down your homework and when it’s due. Write down when you have tests. Write down when you’re going to study. Do not count on being able to remember what homework you have to do. That is nuts. Just write it down, and check it every day. No more missed assignments! 2. Get your work done ASAP \n(source) \nA great way to make school easier and more successful for you is to change your perspective on due dates. Instead of working backward from the due date to get it done in time, work forward from the moment it’s assigned. Do your homework first. Start it as soon as you get it. Then you’ll be done, and you’ll be free . 3. Make school work for you \n(source) \nYour grades don’t determine how smart you are, but they can affect your future. Instead of feeling like school is a big test you have to pass, or a judgement of who you are, see school as a tool to get you where you want to go. When it’s time to apply to colleges, you’ll want to be able to get into schools you really love. You won’t want to be limited because you couldn’t motivate yourself to try hard enough sophomore year. Good grades are a tool to get what you want. So just work as hard as you have to in order to get the grades you need, so that you can do what you really want to with your life. 4. Take notes in class \n(source) \nTake! Notes! TAKE NOTES! Write sh*t down with a pen or pencil on paper. You will remember it better, I promise you. Your memory is not that good and there’s no need to make life harder for yourself. My strategy has always been to take really good notes in class and then review my notes before a test. That’s it! Lots of people barely pay attention in class and then freak out before a test and spend hours and hours studying. You don’t have to spend hours studying if you pay attention the first time, I swear to God. 5. Talk to your teachers \n(source) \nSome teachers are dicks who want you to fail, but they’re in the minority — most teachers are actually hard-working people who want you to succeed. They’re a resource, so use them. If you need help understanding a concept, ask your teacher. See if they can go over it with you after school or during lunch. Just don’t make it sound like you’re all about grades. If you genuinely want to learn the material, most teachers will be excited to work with you. This is also a good skill to develop in high school before you go to college, when going to office hours is part of good study skills. If you're in college and you haven’t made a habit yet of going to your professors’ office hours, start this semester. Get to know your professors. They’ll be more inclined to give you extra help if you need it and write you letters of recommendation in the future. Most teachers are in education because they want to help people learn. See them as allies, not as enemies and your grades will benefit! \nDo you plan to do better in school in 2017? How do you plan to improve?
