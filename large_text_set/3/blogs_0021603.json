Giphy \nOddly enough, this kind of thing happens more often than we think it does. \nA Reddit user recently started a thread asking members to share their experiences of marrying the brother or sister of an ex, and one poor guy’s horrific story stood out from the rest. \nThe user, who goes by TaylorSchwiftyAMA , told a story about his brother marrying his ex-girlfriend, and the ending will make you cringe. Reddit \nHe explains how his ex-girlfriend loves his family so much she decided to stick around and date his brother. \nHe wrote, \nI dated a woman for a couple of months many years ago, then broke up with her. However, she adored my family, so she continued to hang around with them – parents, brothers, etc. Fast forward 10 years, and she’s dating my younger brother, and I have to invite them TO MY WEDDING. \nFast forward another year or two, and THEY get married… so now my ex-GF is my sister-in-law. So… yeah. His ex-girlfriend is currently his sister-in-law. \nIt gets worse, though. \nThe baffled guy explained his brother and ex-GF had a child and named their kid after him. \nYUP. \nHe said, \nBUT WAIT. I am named after my father (like a junior)… so I should give my son the same, right? Like TaylorSchwiftyAMA III… except I decide not to – He can become his own man, instead of living in his dad’s/granddad’s shadow. \nSo THEY name their first son TaylorSchwiftyAMA III… ergo my nephew has MY name. My ex-GF now shrieks my name every time Lil’ Taylor gets into shit. \nC’MON, NOW. THAT’S NOT COOL. Giphy \nNow, every time his ex-girlfriend yells at her child, she’s yelling her ex-boyfriend’s name. \nLuckily, his family isn’t too affected by the messy marriage. In fact, the Reddit user claimed his wife doesn’t even care too much that his sister-in-law is his ex-girlfriend. \nHe finished his Reddit post, \nMy wife is OK with things, because we don’t live in the same city (edit: as my brother’s family) and only see each other the rest of the family on holidays and special occasions. \nHowever, it doesn’t help stereotypes that we happen to be from a southern state. No Southerner wants to contribute to inbreeding jokes more than they absolutely have to. \nOOF. At least his wife is cool about it. \nIt might be hard to believe, but the other stories about inter-family relationships on the Reddit thread are just as crazy. \nOne person wrote about his dad dating his aunt before marrying his mom. \nHe claimed his dad was dating his mom’s sister because she was the “second best” choice before ending up with his mother. Reddit \nAnother person wrote about a similar scenario where his dad was dating his aunt back in the day. \nEventually, they broke up, and his mother ended up dating and marrying him. Apparently, his mom and aunt laugh about it now. Reddit \nSee? Lots of families experience this kind of thing. \nIf one of your exes starts to date one of your family members, rest assured you aren’t alone. 5 Stages Every Girl Goes Through When Her Friend Gets Engaged [5TAGES] To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
