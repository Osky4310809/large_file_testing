By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 18, 2017 9:43 AM MCD Polls: Amit Shah has appointed BJP supervisors for the upcoming elections. (Source: PTI) \nIn a major development, Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah has appointed V Sahasrabuddhe, Jitendra Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman, Sanjeev Balyan and Shyam Jaju to supervise Delhi Municipal Poll campaign for the party. The decision was taken on Saturday morning and on the same day party is scheduled to announce its Chief Minister face in Uttar Pradesh. After getting a massive mandate in the 2017 Assembly elections, BJP is looking to strengthen its position in Delhi too by winning the MC polls. The election for Municipal Corporation is scheduled to take place next month and BJP is likely to begin its campaign on 22nd April. \nYesterday, it roped in wrestlers Babita and Geeta Phogat, the Phogat sisters of “Dangal” fame and is in talk with several other personalities of different fields to change its fortunes in the high-stakes MCD elections. The party had also drafted Bhojpuri star Ravi Kishan and is also believed to be in talks with Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan for canvassing. \nYou may also want to watch: \n“We are going all-out in the MCD polls and have set a very high target for our party. Our triumphs in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have given fresh impetus to our workers and volunteers and to add to that strength we are bringing in big faces as well,” a source said told the news agency ANI. BJP party chief Amit Shah, General Secretary (Organisation) Ramlal and Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu are also scheduled to address a convention of polling booth in-charges at Ramlila Maidan on Sunday. \n“BJP had appointed Manoj Tiwari as party’s Delhi Chief who looks determined to achieve the task in hand. “Besides, sports and entertainment, achievers from other fields would also be seen during the campaigns. We want our biggest leaders and most famous faces to address the public. We also hope PM Modiji will address the crowd at least once. We are going to write to him requesting for his presence, but nonetheless, he is our guiding force,” BJP Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari told reporters.
