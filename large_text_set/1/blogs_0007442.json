Michael America, Victor de Souza and Zang Toi would all be thrilled to dress America’s first lady,” the paper added. \nAny designer who dresses her will get enormous press,” Shafiroff told the newspaper. \nMost designers would love to get the press of having the First Lady wearing one of their gowns, especially someone who is likely to be a fashion trendsetter like Melania Trump. \nBut imagine people on the left being so petty that they can’t even handle people dressing Melania. \nOne of Melania Trump’s favorite designers, Stefano Gabbana, has made it clear that he is not stopped by leftist tactics. \nHe proudly posted a picture of her on Instagram, taken at her New Year’s Eve party. \nHe said how thankful he was that she wore his dress. \nSounds like boycott attempt is going up in smoke. \nWho ever thought just the wearing of a dress would be part of a culture war?
