They were fine with his transphobia, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. They were fine with how he encourages his followers to harass women and people of colour and transgender people online.” The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion \nProtesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March Getty 2/10 Trump and abortion \nUS President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House Getty Images 3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' \nNancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.
