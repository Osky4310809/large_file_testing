Peter Wright reflects on sensational Premier League display in Exeter \nFinishes of 110 and 104 helped Wright into an early 3-0 lead, and he extended that to 7-2 before Wright claimed four of the next five to rally and reduce the gap to 8-6. \nA key 86 checkout from Wright, however, proved crucial as he regained a three-leg cushion before he punished missed doubles from Price to lead 10-6, and an 85 finish on the bull saw him claim glory over the emerging Welsh star. \n\"Fair play to Peter,\" said Gurney. \"What separates the men from the boys was his finishing, and week-in week-out playing on TV in the Premier League like he does showed there. That's where I need to improve and that's the standard.\" \nWright is the PDC's form player, having recorded the second highest televised average in history with a thrilling 7-2 defeat of Adrian Lewis in Exeter , as he joined Phil Taylor at the top of the Premier League table last Thursday. \nCoral UK Open - Sunday March 5 \nAfternoon Session Alan Norris 10-9 Kim HuybrechtsGerwyn Price 10-9 Ian WhiteDaryl Gurney 10-9 Simon WhitlockPeter Wright 10-8 Raymond van BarneveldBest of 19 legs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T01:43:03.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
