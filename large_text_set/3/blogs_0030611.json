Katie's story \nKatie, 25, posts Instagram updates about endometriosis and the treatment she's getting. \nKatie visited her doctor nine times before she was diagnosed with the condition. \n\"I went to the doctor so many times and I kept going back. \n\"There were things that they were throwing out there like IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) or saying some people just get bad periods and you're just one of the unlucky ones.\" \n\"One doctor told me to stop doing sit-ups because it was all muscular. \n\"So I struggled a lot when I was at school and I would just pray that my period would come at the weekend so I wouldn't have to miss school and I wouldn't have to miss work.\" Amy's story \nAmy is 23 and a student at Oxford Brookes University. \nIt took doctors five years to diagnose her condition. \nHer endometriosis got so bad last year she had to quit her job and had to stay in bed for several weeks. What treatment is there? \nAt the moment there's no cure for endometriosis but symptoms can be treated. \nAmy had a hormonal coil fitted which has helped her. \nOthers, like Katie, have had surgery to remove it - but it can grow back. \nFor many, it's just a case of treating the symptoms with pain killers. \nSome women in the past have been told a hysterectomy (removing the womb) or having a baby can cure it, but there's no evidence to back those claims. \nThe new report says that treatment for women with endometriosis is currently unacceptable - with women being often dismissed by healthcare professionals. \nIt said 42% of women interviewed claim they were not treated with dignity and respect by doctors. Why does it take so long to get a diagnosis? \nIt takes an average of seven and a half years to diagnose endometriosis. \nIn order to make a diagnosis, women have to have something called a laparoscopy. It's an operation in which a camera is inserted into the pelvis to look for any signs of endometriosis. \nProfessor Helen Stokes-Lampard from the Royal College of GPs says it's a tricky illness for GPs to identify. \n\"GPs face two major challenges here - both identifying condition that has very diverse symptoms and mimics lots of other things,\" she told Newsbeat. \n\"Also if we were to refer everybody with symptoms that could possibility be endometriosis, hospitals would be completely swamped and that wouldn't help the hospitals or the patients. \n\"Some patients would have operations they didn't need.\" Word is getting out... \nCelebrities like Girls creator Lena Dunham, Star Wars actress Daisy Ridley and singer Halsey have talked openly about their endometriosis. \nCampaigners are now calling for better education on menstrual health in schools and improved training for GPs. \n\"The report highlights some really practical things we can do to reduce diagnose time and support women with this condition,\" Emma Cox, from Endometriosis UK, says. \nThat includes \"education in menstrual health in schools\" and \"education for GPs and raising awareness with the public\". \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:33:46.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
