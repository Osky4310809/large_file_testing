He assisted and when the ambulance arrived was thanked and told he could move on.\" David Beckham (Photo: Rex Features) \nAnother woman, who also stopped to help the injured person, tweeted: \"Was helping an old lady who fell over on my lunch break and guess who drives up to help? David Beckham. That's who. What a gentleman.\" \nMeanwhile, David and his wife Victoria do a lot of work for various charities and David previously revealed how proud he was that their son Cruz, 11, released his debut single 'If Every Day Was Christmas', in December, for charity.

And Cruz came to us and said 'How about I do a Christmas song for charity? And all the proceeds go to charity.' There's nothing more to this than that at the moment.

That's the most important thing. But he wanted to give back and he's done this amazing little Christmas song that's got a lot of attention. And you know we are very proud of it. He came to us with the idea.
