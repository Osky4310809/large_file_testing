Full details will be made available on March 1, but from Land Rover's teaser, we know it's sized to slot between the compact Evoque and the slightly larger Sport . It's rumored that Velar is based off the Jaguar F-Pace , which would make sense, given its size. \nYou'll never hear me complain about a glass roof this large. It's gorgeous! Land Rover \nLand Rover's talking heads say that the car \"changes everything,\" but more likely than not, it's just a utility vehicle with a more coupe-like rear end, which is the current trend. That would put it in contention with smaller, sportier crossovers from the Porsche Macan to the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class Coupe and BMW X4 . \nLand Rover also says the car takes a \"visually reductive\" approach. That shouldn't be too hard, because Range Rover interiors are generally pretty simple, with lots of straight, clean lines, something I quite enjoy. \nThe name Velar comes from Land Rover's original Range Rover prototypes and is derived from the Latin velaris , which means \"to veil or cover.\" That makes sense for a prototype that's supposed to be under wraps, but on a production model, it sounds all exotic and mysterious. \nWe'll know more on March 1, and there's a good chance it'll show up at the Geneva Motor Show or shortly thereafter. \nThis infographic is a very complicated way to say, \"This is the first Range Rover Velar.\" Land Rover", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:40:15.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
