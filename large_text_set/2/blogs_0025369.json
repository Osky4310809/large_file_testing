Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nThis year’s iPhones may boast USB-C connectors, claims a new report from the Wall Street Journal . \nIf true, this would bring the next-gen iPhones in line with the company’s push to embrace the industry standard connector — as seen with recent MacBooks, which have ditched legacy connectors in favor of a single USB-C port for both power and data transfers. \nWhat’s not clear from the report is whether this would mean ditching the existing proprietary Lightning connector in favor of USB-C, or whether Apple might switch out the USB -A plug for a USB-C one. If the former, this would be the third change in connector for the iPhone, after it switched out the original 30-pin dock connector for the Lightning connector with 2012’s iPhone 5. \nThe WSJ report also adds another voice to the growing number of stories claiming that Apple will release three different iPhones in 2017: two LCD “s” cycle iPhones, and an extra high-end iPhone 8 to mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. Previous rumors have suggested the 2017 iPhone will come in three screen sizes : 5.8 inches, 5.5 inches and 4.7 inches. Of these, the 5.8-inch “10th Anniversary Edition” iPhone 8 will feature the most exciting innovations, including a curved OLED display manufactured by Samsung, as well as dropping the Home button for a Touch Bar-style “function area” in the bottom part of the smartphone’s display.\nAlthough the newspaper doesn’t mention a price point, one previous report claimed the high-end 2017-era iPhone cost cost as much as $1,000, or more . \nAre you optimistic about this year’s new iPhones?
