Late-night roundup: Jeff Sessions is 'the human antidote to the Voting Rights Act' Read more \nConway, who has previously expressed her distaste for the reality TV star turned president, was under fire for promoting Ivanka Trump’s clothing line on Fox News this week, violating ethics rules. \nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah joked about her aggressive selling tactics, in comparison with what we had been promised about the separation of politics and business. \n“I love how in less than three weeks we’ve gone from ‘the presidency and Trump businesses are totally separate’ to ‘come on down to the White House and buy buy buy’,” he said.

Trump responded by bringing up Blumenthal’s falsehoods over his time serving in Vietnam.

Trump’s tragic Nam story is captured in the film Apocalypse Ow.” \nOn Late Night with Seth Meyers, the comic examined the timing of Trump’s Nordstrom tweet, noting that it was just 21 minutes after he was supposed to be in his daily intelligence briefing. \n“I feel like the president’s daily intelligence briefing should take longer than an episode of Vanderpump Rules,” he said. \nHe also ridiculed Conway’s tactics regarding Ivanka Trump’s clothing line: “From now on the only network Kellyanne Conway should be allowed on is QVC.” \nHe went on to bring up Trump’s repeated assertion that America is experiencing its worst crime rate in 47 years, a figure that is wrong and one that the president says causes shock every time he repeats it. “It’s easy to surprise people if you just make shit up,” he said. \nFinally, in reference to Trump’s repeated use of the word on social media, he pleaded: “Please stop using the word haters. You’re the president of the United States, not a B-list rapper.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:44:36.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
