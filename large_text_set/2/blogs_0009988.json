Less Lady Gaga, and more old school Hollywood, Emma wore her auburn locks slicked back and pinned down with what seemed to be her own hair. The actress wore a jeweled gown with a plunging neckline and matching pants to the awards ceremony, and by keeping her hair and makeup simple, she really showed off her outfit. We love that although her hair wasn’t done in any over-the-top intricate style, the bow she wore added a really nice, interesting detail to an otherwise classic look.\n✨AAAAHHHH BAFTA winner right here!!!✨✨✨ \nA photo posted by Mara Roszak (@mararoszak) on Feb 12, 2017 at 1:31pm PST \nIt seems like Emma’s hair stylist wrapped a section of her hair around another section of hair before pinning everything down with bobby pins, hiding the pins as she worked. The resulting look feels like a mix between a hair bow and a knot, and we love how it makes such a simple and sleek style really pop. There’s still an element of play with this look, thanks to the pants and hair, and we love that about Emma and her style.\nSamir Hussein/Getty We also love that this style feels like a modern version of the mullet. Business in the front, party in the back, anyone? If there’s anyone who can effortlessly find the flow between work and play, while still looking gorgeous, it’s Emma. And that will always be something we love about her.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:22:26.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
