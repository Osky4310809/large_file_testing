As Shimkus questioned which “mandates” included in the popularly termed “Obamacare” might be unfair, he had this to say: WOW. The #GOP ’s reason to object to insurance covering prenatal care? “Why should men pay for it?” Watch: #Trumpcare #ProtectOurCare pic.twitter.com/Q55nG1Un8j \n— NARAL (@NARAL) March 9, 2017 \nAlright. Hold up just a sec. This is a man who likely benefited from prenatal care at some point in his life if we assume he’s not a Stepford-wife style alien plant. Shimkus also has 3 sons, all of whom were, presumably, beneficiaries of prenatal care. \nAnd yet this guy has the gall to stand up in front of Congress and say that children do not deserve the contributions of men (who, btw, HELPED CREATE THESE CHILDREN IN THE FIRST PLACE) because they were birthed by women . As a conservative Chirstian, I’m not sure why that idea is so hard to process for him. Well… no, that’s a lie. \nSomeone needs to give this guy a biology lesson, STAT.
