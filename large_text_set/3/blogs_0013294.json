They are required to pay for the procedure privately, which can cost £330–£410 up to 14 weeks and up to £1,350 at 20 weeks and beyond, as free NHS abortion services are not extended to women from Northern Ireland.\nView this image ›\nASN / Via justgiving.com\nID: 10712867 Abortion Support Network (ASN) is a UK-based charity that helps fund costs for women from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – where abortion is also illegal – who can’t afford to travel to England for the procedure. It launched an emergency appeal on Thursday and had surpassed its fundraising target twice over within hours of being set up.\nOne anonymous donor gave £1,000 to help women who might now be too afraid to order abortion pills online.\nMara Clarke, ASN’s founder, told BuzzFeed News: “When these things happen, it’s so outrageous that people want to make a difference. I love people!”\nShe added: “Arresting people for this, charging people, searching people’s homes is despicable, and we love being the beneficiary of the outrage. Our goal is to be made obsolete by law change.”\nWhen a woman in Northern Ireland was prosecuted in relation to the alleged online purchase of abortion pills last year, and another woman, who is currently appealing her conviction, was put on trial for obtaining the pills for her 15-year-old pregnant daughter, Clarke said the number of women from Northern Ireland contacting ASN for support grew by more than 10%.\nShe believes that as a result of the raids, ASN will again see an increase in the number of women contacting the charity, both from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, where there will be a knock-on effect of women fearing prosecution.\nClarke said the police crackdown could further endanger vulnerable women facing crisis pregnancies: “If the PSNI is saying don’t take safe-but-illegal pills, what they’re saying is leave the country or have a baby you don’t want, and it’s going to drive people for whom neither of those things is a possibility to do less safe things to try and terminate.”\nASN hopes to be able to fund as many of those women as possible to travel to England to access abortion safely instead, but Clarke said that campaigners lobbying the government for change will be vital in the long run.\n“We know that well over 1,000 women from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland use these pills every year,” Clarke said. “If 1,000 of those people come to us instead, even half those people, we’re going to run out of money!”\nUpset that the PSNI seeks to arrest people with SAFE but illegal pills?
