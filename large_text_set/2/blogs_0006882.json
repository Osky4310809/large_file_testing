Curtis Nicholson tells PEOPLE that DeLeon’s family was a driving force in their investigation.\n“They lost their loved one,” he says. “They help keep you focused. They help keep you moving on when sometimes things get rough, or sometimes when you’re not getting the results that you want, they help keep you going down the road. This family was very involved from Day 1.”\n• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

On Tuesday, her bond was reduced from $1 million to $500,000, according to a report in the Kansas City Star . If she posts bond, the judge ordered her to be placed on house arrest and she must hand over her passport.\nA preliminary hearing is scheduled for April 7.\n• Pick up PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: Cases That Shocked America, on sale now , for the latest on Casey Anthony, JonBenét Ramsey and more. \nStill, there are many unanswered questions. In the course of the investigation, officials believed they linked DeLeon’s case and another death in nearby Independence, Missouri.\nIn January 1994, Diana Ault was shot to death inside her home while her 4-year-old son and 8-month-old daughter were left unharmed. Investigators have long suspected that the two deaths were linked, but didn’t have evidence. No one has been charged in connection with Ault’s death.\nDateline speaks with family members from both DeLeon’s and Ault’s families.\nThe episode airs at 10 p.m. ET on Friday on NBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:51:40.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
