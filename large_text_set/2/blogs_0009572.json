The highly anticipated show follows Luke Cage to become Marvel’s latest standalone TV project, and it will see Finn Jones take on the mystical hero Iron Fist. However, after the trailer aired, the Internet began buzzing about how similar the character’s origins are to Arrow ’s Oliver Queen. \nBut, if you ask Stephen Amell about the overlap, it’s not something to worry about. \nOver on Facebook, a fan decided to ask the Arrow star about the noted similarities between Queen and Rand. After posting the curious comment, Amell responded to the inquiry, writing, “I couldn’t care less!” \nOf course, there are plenty of shallow similarities between the Arrow hero and Rand. The two boys came from wealthy, elite families who were ultimately betrayed by those close to them. Suddenly orphaned, the two heroes train in harsh, isolated conditions before returning back to their homes with a need for vengeance. So far, it looks like Netflix will be sticking closely to Iron Fist’s first origins while Arrow based much of its content on a recent limited comic series that reimagined Queen’s roots. \nStill, there seems to be ample room for the character’s to differentiate themselves. The characters may have common, overarching plots, but Oliver and Rand have completely different temperaments. And, obviously, one of the heroes is gifted with K’un Lun martial arts training while the other benefits from some serious hand-eye coordination. \nThis week, Arrow will return on Wednesday with “Spectre of the Gun.” You can check out its synopsis below: \nWILD DOG’S HISTORY IS REVEALED — A traumatic attack on City Hall triggers painful memories for Rene (Rick Gonzalez) about his family. Flashbacks reveal how Rene went from simple family man to a hero named Wild Dog. \nMeanwhile, Oliver (Stephen Amell) must deal with the perpetrator behind the attack and realizes the best way to do so is as Mayor Queen instead of the Green Arrow. Tensions run high in the Arrow bunker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:17:58.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
