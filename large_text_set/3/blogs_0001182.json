I’m writing every day. I got some shit, man.” \nA portion of the conversation between the three artists was shared in a video Trav uploaded to his Instagram page. \n“Me And Bro @meekmill On The Line With Lil Bro @bobby_shmurda #FreeThe9 Made Him Freestyle Real Quick,” Trav wrote in the caption to the short video. \nWith his writing claims, Shmurda was of course encouraged to let Meek and Trav hear something. \n“Hatin-ass niggas never going nowhere … They never wanna see you go nowhere,” he raps over the phone, letting loose a flurry of bars.
