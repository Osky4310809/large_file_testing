Abi Branning reckons that his ideal birthday gift might be Johnny Carter but is she right about there being sparks between them?\n(Picture: BBC) Elsewhere, Denise Fox and Kush Kazemi grow closer at the Queen Vic quiz night – which sees a competitive Kim square up to a team of die-hard trivia fanatics. Lauren, meanwhile, is still harbouring thoughts for the man she met at a photocopier (swoon!) and as the second episode gets underway, she finds herself taking Whitney Carter on a night out just so she can bump into him.\n(Picture: BBC) Back on the Square, oblivious Steven Beale is trying to build bridges with her dad Max, unaware that Lauren might be about to cheat on him.\nThe pressure is still on for Michelle Fowler but will Preston’s return ease or accelerate her stress? In other developments, Tina and Mick consider breaking the news to Sylvie that she might be going back into a home.\n(Picture: BBC) Temptation, sexual tension, dilemmas, anguish…that’s a lot to squeeze into an hour!\nEastEnders airs on Tuesday 21st March at 7:30pm and then again at 9pm on BBC One, with an hour of Holby City in between.
