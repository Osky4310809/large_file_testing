Cuomo’s helicopter made an emergency landing at Stewart International Airport after the cockpit filled with smoke on his way back to New York City from his last of six State of the State speeches.\nThe emergency landing occurred just before 4 p.m., when the cabin smelled like smoke and the pilot brought the chopper down safely in Orange County.\n“The cause of the issue is being investigated and the helicopter is currently undergoing maintenance,” said James Allen, communications director for the governor.\n“No one was injured and everyone has been safely transported back to the city.”\nState Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli recently denied a request for a $12.5 million helicopter to take Cuomo across the state.\nThe State Police argued it needs the used Sikorsky S76-D because its 13-chopper fleet is aging and and a new helicopter hasb’t been added since 2002.\nDiNapoli questioned the purchase because the aircraft was outfitted with a deluxe VIP interior that included a leather removable bench.\nDiNapoli’s office said at the time that he would approve the purchase if Cuomo’s office made a better case about it was needed.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:20:47.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
