I followed him to sell a family land. But instead of giving me money to open the shop, he took me to Okitipupa and bought Nokia phone for me,” Adegbohun narrated. \n“I told my friends that my brother had cheated me on our family land. I told them to get my own share of the money for me. \n“The total amount of money with him was N1.4million. But I told them to collect only half of the money. I told them not to kill him because he is my blood brother.” \nHis alleged accomplice, Sola Ogunyemi, confirmed that they were contacted by Adegbohun “to help rob his brother because he was cheated after a parcel of family land was sold” . Adegbehun \nOgunyemi, who claimed to be an ex-convict, said he robbed the brother and shared the money among his gang members. \nMeanwhile, 14 other suspected armed robbers were also paraded by the state police command. \nThe suspects were allegedly picked up in different parts of Ondo State by the police, acting on tip- off. \nPolice Commissioner in the state, Hilda Harrison, said the suspects were arrested in Akure, Okipupa, Oka-Akoko and Igbokoda. \nThe suspects include Amabami Monday, Enetufo Ajinde, Patrick Emmanuel, Daisi Enetufo, Anifowose Alaba and Segun Matowobunmi. \nOthers are Soji Akintokun, Olowolayemo Obebe, Olajide Olatayo, Amonimo Johnson, Tunbosun Ibitoye, Damilare Oyepo and Abiola Omolafe. \nItems recovered from the suspects, according to the commissioner, include guns, axes, live cartridges, charms and mobile phones. \nThe police boss said the suspects had confessed to crimes and that all of them would soon be charged to court. \nIn another development, a student of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, Tosin Olusanya, a.k.a ‘Target’, who was said to have initiated many of her secondary school mates into cultism, has been sentenced to seven years imprisonment by an Akure High Court for cultism and gang-rape. \nHis jail sentence came after weeks of trial. \nTosin, 22, who claimed to have belonged to the Eiye cult, was himself initiated when he was in secondary school. \nThe convict, according to the prosecution counsel, Mr Remi Olatubora, was notorious for arranging the gang-raping of any girl to be initiated by not less than ten boys and also in the habit of putting red pepper into the private part of the female convert, the act they called ‘baptism of fire’.
