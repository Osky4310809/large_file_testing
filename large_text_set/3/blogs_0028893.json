Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAshley Williams has revealed he felt \"sick\" when he realised close friend Seamus Coleman had suffered an horrific leg fracture as the pair went head-to-head with World Cup qualification at stake. \nThe Wales skipper faced Coleman's Republic of Ireland in Dublin on Friday evening, and has admitted he did not know how seriously injured the full-back was in a challenge by Neil Taylor until after the final whistle. \nWilliams told Everton's official website, www.evertonfc.com : \"I didn't really see the tackle. All I saw was the red card and my initial reaction was to go to the referee.

It took me a minute to realise, 'Actually, he hasn't got up,' and that it was Seamus who was down. \n\"At that point, I wasn't thinking about the game or us being down to 10 men. I started thinking, 'Is my mate okay?'. That was when I went over to him. \n\"Even at that point, I didn't know it was so serious. After the game, I went straight into their dressing room to speak to James McCarthy, and he told me Seamus had gone to hospital and had broken his leg.

Even people who don't know Seamus like I do were gutted. Neil Taylor was completely gutted. He was sitting on the floor virtually in tears. \n\"He asked me to check if it would be okay to go to see Seamus in hospital. He got his number off me and sent him a text straight away. \n\"When I found out it was a broken leg, it made me feel sick inside because it's someone who I like so much and is one of my mates.

And as I know him, he's one of the good guys in football, just an honest pro.\" \nEverton midfielder Yannick Bolasie, who is currently working his way back from a serious knee injury, has backed Coleman to make a full recovery.

The club have been supportive with me, especially the manager and staff, so I'm sure it's going to be the same outcome for him. \n\"He's a strong character so I can see him coming back better.\" \nIt proved to be a costly international break for the Toffees, with McCarthy having aggravated a hamstring problem during the warm-up before the Wales game, and defender Ramiro Funes Mori damaging a knee playing for Argentina. poll loading Will Seamus Coleman play again in 2017? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T18:53:43.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
