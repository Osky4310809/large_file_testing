For him these battles in the courts are important because they protect freedom of expression. \n\"He could only afford to pay the legal bills thanks to donations, mainly from people in Britain, who have given more than £50,000. With the support in Britain he obviously thinks his second book on the case would sell well if translated into English and he is actively looking for a publisher. \n\"He would also ask any publisher if they would be interested in publishing his first book in English.\" Read More Madeleine McCann vanished almost 10 years ago (Photo: Find Madeleine Campaign/PA) The three-year-old vanished from a hotel in Praia Da Luz (Photo: Philip Coburn / Daily Mirror) \nThe McCanns are understood to be prepared to sue if the book is sold in the UK. \nMr Amaral was in charge of the investigation when three-year-old Madeleine, then went missing from the apartment the McCanns were staying in in Praia da Luz as Kate and Gerry ate dinner with friends. \nThe judges' official ruling is set to be published later this week. \nThe McCanns said in a statement: \"What we have been told by our lawyers is obviously extremely disappointing. \n\"It is eight years since we brought the action and in that time the landscape has dramatically changed, namely there is now a joint Metropolitan Police-Policia Judiciaria investigation which is what we've always wanted. \n\"The police in both countries continue to work on the basis that there is no evidence that Madeleine has come to physical harm. \n\"We will, of course, be discussing the implications of the Supreme Court ruling with our lawyers in due course.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:34:05.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
