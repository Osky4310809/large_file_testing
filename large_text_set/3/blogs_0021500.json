REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Republican Voters Approve Of The Health Care Bill TOP 5546368 \nRepublican voters largely support the House leadership’s health care bill, according to a Morning Consult poll published Wednesday. \nSixty-two percent of Republican voters support the measure, compared to only 18 percent who disapprove. Democrats largely disapprove of the bill, with 57 percent against the Obamacare replacement. Forty percent of Democratic voters “strongly disapprove” of the measure. \nOverall, there is only 41 percent bipartisan approval — down from last week’s 46 percent in the same poll — and 38 percent of voters oppose the plan. \nA significant 22 percent of respondents indicated they aren’t sure, or didn’t have enough information to make up their minds about their level of support for the bill. \nThe House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill as early as Wednesday, with the major hurdle being the House Freedom Caucus. As many as 23 GOP members have indicated they don’t support the bill. \nMorning Consult surveyed 1,927 registered voters, and carried a margin of error of 2 percentage points in either direction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:25:30.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
