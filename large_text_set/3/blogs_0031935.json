The horrible things that the capitalist system forces people to do in order to survive within it. \n2. Zesty memes, videos and GIFs that critique the social, moral and ideological decay of western capitalist culture. \n3. The larger trend of corporate immorality and the increasing commodification and marketing of things that should not be commodified or marketed (such as social justice movements like the Starbucks 'race together' or Gay Pride). \n4. Mocking the general hypocrisy and irrationality of Capitalism as it accelerates the process of digging its own grave. Remember: \nBrigading from other subs, harassment, personal attacks on fellow users, bigotry, ableism, intolerance and hate speech are all bannable offenses. \nWe do allow links to threads and comments on Reddit as long as they are relevant to the content guidelines and follow the rules. Use np links or your post will be deleted . \nDo not post NSFL Content, it will be removed. \nSupport for capitalism--and the political parties which uphold it--is strictly prohibited; comments showing support for capitalism and capitalist parties and politicians will be removed and the user punished at moderator discretion. \nMods are getting stricter with content quality. Shit content that does not fit the content criteria (like posts about Basic Income) will now be removed. \nAll bans are at mod discretion for violating specific rules or the general anti-capitalist nature of the sub. Nobody, not even the mods, has an inviolable right to be here. We're not going to try to make people who don't belong feel welcome. \nThis subreddit is a safe space. Philosophy: \nThis subreddit has its roots in broad-based anti-capitalist thought, with an underlying Marxist tendency that is steeped in intersectionalist Critical Theory. \nWhen it comes to proposed alternatives to Capitalism, it is the general consensus of this subreddit that the contradiction between Capital and Labour must be eliminated; the working class should own and control the means of production. \nWe have a twitter account now, it posts links to new content here: @late_capitalism \nSidebar image credit: Barbara Kruger", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:23:54.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
