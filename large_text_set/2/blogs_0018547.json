Or treat yo’self? One mom decided to spend with purpose. (Photo: Getty Images) More Tax refunds are coming in, and while some of us will be spending our cash on frivolities, others are making responsible adult decisions with those extra coins. Case in point: Christina Knaack, who shared on Facebook how she spent her tax refund. The single mother of two posted an image of a receipt amounting to $5,400. “I got back $5,600 on my taxes. Instead of buying my kids the latest Jordans or fancy electronics I paid my rent for the YEAR,” she captioned it. “I’m a single mom and I do it all buy myself on a minimum wage job. I [know] that a roof over my kids head is what’s important. My kids don’t want for anything because my priorities are straight. And this also means I will have that extra 450 a month to do things with my kids.” In less than 24 hours, Knaack’s post had been shared more than 95,000 times, with more than 217,000 reactions and 27,000 comments, many of which were positive. “Great. You are a responsible mother. So many people blow that money rather than spending it on something they really need,” one person wrote. “It’s her money and she spent it in a wise manner. She now she has a roof over her and her kids heads. She now needn’t worry if she can pay the rent and all the monthly bills. It’s $450 of burden let off her shoulders. It’s $450 a month towards more groceries or $450 a month of getting other debt paid off. Bottom line, it was her money and she spent it how she saw fit on something important,” another commenter said. “Way to go mama. I’m paying bills on the computer right now. Single mom too… Jordans can’t pay to have a roof over your head…” someone offered. In spite of all the great feedback, there were also people who responded negatively to the post, criticizing Knaack for not having a lot of money and for having inexpensive rent. Some people complained that her refund was too high, and didn’t think that she deserved it, in spite of the fact that she is working to take care of two children on her own. “You should thank us who are paying your rent with the taxes we pay, I don’t understand how people get back far more than they put in,” someone commented. “Probably a section 8 place,” another snarky individual wrote. Essentially, some people took it upon themselves to chastise her for simply having a low income. Still, there were plenty of people commenting in defense of Knaack’s prudent decision. “I swear some people are just pathetic! If she had used that money to get her hair done and bought a new car and expensive shoes and purses y’all would [complain] she is a bad mother, yet she does something smart and secures a home for her children y’all STILL [complain]??? Get a life!!” one person said passionately. “It blows my mind that people can find a way to criticize a single mother doing something wise with her return. I mean seriously, wow! There are states with rental units that low it’s not something that is unheard of. I am more dumbfounded by the amount of people that are so critical. It doesn’t matter who you are, or where you’re from, or what you’ve done. People will always find a way to be negative. It’s sad really.” Another person commended Knaack for her decision, writing, “My mom used to take her tax return and blow it on things like gambling… it’s pretty cool how she paid all her years rent instead.” Knaack posted this morning to say how surprised she was at the overwhelming reaction to her post. She said she “never expected to go viral,” and also mentioned that in January, she reached a milestone of being clean for three years. She says she posted the image in hopes that her story would help other people in her position: “I didn’t share this for attention from the world. I just shared my accomplishments with people I [know]. I made it public so if anyone shared it others could see it in hopes a recovering addict would see it and see that life off the streets is possible and for any single moms to [know] it is possible to survive on ur own. As long as my post has inspired people I’m happy with that.” And it looks like she already has. Knaack shared a message she got from one of the commenters who has dealt with addiction in her family. “I’ve buried a son due to addiction and believe me when I tell you that you are the essence of hope for the multitudes who are suffering,” the commenter wrote. “I cannot fathom anyone who would say anything negative to you, but sadly, this world is becoming an ugly place.” Knaack is set to appear on Fox Carolina News today to talk about her story. We reached out to her for comment, and will update you when we hear back.
