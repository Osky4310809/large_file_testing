in England with the reputation as the best boss in world football after stellar results at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Reuters 8 Pep Guardiola has not delivered the goods so far for Manchester City – but Jurgen Klopp is doing well at Liverpool \nAnd he was tipped to lead the way in the shoot-out with some of the game’s most renowned coaches as he took on Jose Mourinho, Jurgen Klopp and co in the top flight. \nBut with half the season gone, Guardiola’s mystique is fast disappearing with his rivals all doing a better job with their squads so far. Watch the best action from the Premier League in our Weekend Round-Up EPA 8 Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is the biggest disappointment so far in the battle of the big Premier League bosses \nAntonio Conte, Arsene Wenger and Mauricio Pochettino are the other star names in the dugouts as England's big boys go toe-to-toe in the race for the title. \nTheir decisions over the next five months will play a major part in the destination of the league title, so SunSport runs the rule over their efforts so far. Antonio Conte - 9/10 \nWe knew he was good after the impact he made at Juventus and with Italy, but the speed at which Conte has taken to life in England has been mightily impressive. \nIt was an advantage that the Italian inherited a squad at Chelsea that, for all their problems last season, had been good enough to win the Premier League the year before, but there was still work to do. Getty Images Antonio Conte has made a big impact at Chelsea and also has Diego Costa firing again Chelsea 4 Stoke 2: Willian scores twice as strong Blues make it 13 wins in a row \nConte's initial approach was to ignore his tried and tested tactics from Juve to give his players a chance to prove themselves - only for the bright start to be ruined by crushing defeats to Liverpool and Arsenal. \nThat gave the boss all the excuse he needed to tell his players to do things his way, and the result has been 13 successive Premier League victories that leaves the club six points clear at the top of the table. \nConte has built a team and a spirit than can win with style or grind it out. Just as important, he has star men like Eden Hazard and Diego Costa believing in him. \nChelsea look unstoppable right now, but the test will come if they suffer two or three injuries in the next couple of months. Jurgen Klopp - 8/10 \nWith two transfer windows now behind him, it is fair to say Liverpool are now a Klopp side, and the results on the pitch are evidence of his impact. \nAll the players are fully tuned in to what the manager demands from them with his high-press tactics, and by and large the improvements have been drastic from last season. \nHe has Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana playing at the top of their games and the Reds currently look the most serious challengers to Chelsea in the title race. Getty Images Jurgen Klopp has Liverpool playing how he wants them but there are still questions over their defence Liverpool 1 Manchester City 0: Georginio Wijnaldum header seals victory \nBut there are still questions over Liverpool defensively which Klopp has to resolve, and his decision to buy Loris Karius in goal is not looking too wise at this stage. \nLiverpool are excellent when they hit top form, but there is still a feeling of vulnerability around them - as Bournemouth exposed last month. Arsene Wenger - 7/10 \nThird in the league and nine points adrift of the leaders is not where Arsenal fans want to be. And though there is much to be excited by at the Emirates, it is the same old problems which continue to haunt the Gunners. \nWenger made an astute signing in Shkodran Mustafi and Arsenal are certainly much harder to break down as a defensive unit than in recent years. Reuters Arsenal are better equipped under Arsene Wenger this season but old problems continue to haunt them Arsenal 2-0 Crystal Palace : Olivier Giroud's wonder goal puts Arsenal third \nBut mentality and delivering in the big games continues to be an Achilles heel that Wenger seems at a loss to deal with. If the first half of the season is anything to go by, it will cost them dearly again. \nWenger is managing his squad well, and has developed a real depth to his options now. But back-to-back defeats to Everton and Manchester City show he still has work to do. Mauricio Pochettino - 8/10 \nJust about out-performing his North London rival by virtue of the continuing signs of improvement of his young squad. \nTottenham's defence is again impressive and Pochettino has succeeded in turning Spurs from being a soft touch to difficult to beat. \nSupporters will point to the seven-week injury lay-off for Harry Kane as being key. But that also exposed poor judgement on Pochettino's front in signing Vincent Janssen as understudy - a player who looks as though he will struggle to make the grade in the Premier League. Watford 1-4 Tottenham : Spurs go into the top 4 for the first time this season Getty Images 8 Mauricio Pochettino is still doing well at Tottenham but they rely too much on Harry Kane \nPochettino is also operating on a fraction of the budget of his rivals, so gradual improvement is the order of the day at White Hart Lane and the Argentine is delivering in the league. \nThe Champions League campaign was a disaster, but only domestic form counts in this report, so Pochettino is performing well. Pep Guardiola - 5/10 \nFifth in the league, ten points off the top and three defeats from the last six matches - those stats are disappointing regardless of who would be in charge of the richest club in British football. \nThe fact that Guardiola was supposed to be taking City on to a different level only serves to increase the disappointment of how things are going at the Etihad. \nThe Spaniard spent big in the summer, but few of his purchases are making a major impact, and the decision to sacrifice Joe Hart for Claudio Bravo looks misguided. Reuters Pep Guardiola needs to scratch his head to come up with some more tactics at Manchester City Liverpool 1 Manchester City 0: Georginio Wijnaldum header seals victory \nDefensively City are vulnerable, and opposition teams look to have figured out a way to play against them. Pep needs to react when teams press high and do not not allow them to settle into the passing game they want to play. \nBut worryingly, Guardiola shows little sign of being willing to make changes to his approach. Some would say this is a brave boss backing himself, but it is a huge gamble. \nFor the money spent, the manager and the players, City's performances overall have been nothing more than average, Jose Mourinho - 8/10 \nThough Manchester United are the lowest of the big six in terms of league position, the job at Old Trafford was bigger than any other in terms of the work needing to be done at the start of the season. \nThe David Moyes and Louis van Gaal years had seen a steady decline in quality and morale which was never going to be reversed overnight. Reuters 8 Jose Mourinho now looks to be relishing the challenge at Manchester United \nMourinho had his problems early in the season, and for a while it looked as though he was struggling to get the results his reputation - and the fans - demanded. \nBut he has grown into the challenge, taken tough decisions, solved the Wayne Rooney problem and now has all his squad perfectly in sync with what he wants them to do. \nThere are more improvements to make, but Mourinho looks as though he is relishing life at Old Trafford and results are starting to come.
