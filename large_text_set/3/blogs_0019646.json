The Galaxy will cost around $860 while the iPhone is expected to cost around $1,000. 2 \nAndroid releases never garner the hype that Apple products do (did you know the new Galaxy comes out in just over a week? — I didn’t!), but this leak could turn some heads. There’s no swaying the Apple die-hards, but people fed up with the finnicky cloud or all their accessories becoming obsolete when the port was changed or Apple’s unfathomable to decision to remove the headphone jack might be willing to jump ship. \nOh, about that last part — rumors say the Galaxy won’t have a headphone jack either. WHY DO YOU THIS TO US, COMPUTERS!? \nSamsung will also offer a slightly larger Galaxy S8+ for $971. Both S8 models are rumored to include the ability to turn into an Android-based computer via dock, and eliminate the home button. \nMaybe Samsung’s price drop is due to careful engineering and an attempt to undercut the increasingly expensive iPhone. Or maybe they have to compensate because the last model would blow your dick off . 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:49:13.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
