That’s not counting five other New York stores in Roslyn, Manhasset, Bronxville, Rye and Woodbury Commons.\nAn industrywide slump has forced many chains, Macy’s include, to close hundreds of locations nationwide. Meanwhile, Bluemercury has been doubling down on growth — even within specific neighborhoods, with four stores on the Upper West Side alone.\n“People are inherently social beings who need interaction and love to be connected to each other, which will drive an increased need for local neighborhood shopping,” predicts operating chief Barry Beck, who co-founded Bluemercury with his wife, Chief Executive Marla Malcolm Beck.\n“The smart retailers will realize that there is actually a need for more well-placed stores, not less,” Beck said.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:24:20.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
