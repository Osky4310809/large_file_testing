But milkshakes can also be clumpy, lumpy, and difficult to suck up through a straw. \nNo more is the above true than with McDonald's shakes. They're thick, which is good, but troublesome. \nMcDonald's knows this, so tasked a specialist laboratory with inventing a straw to combat the issue in the hope of giving customers an easier ride. The tool has been likened to an Apple-style creation. \nYesterday, on Facebook Live , the company hosted a 20 minute session in which it unveiled a bizarre J-shaped straw. It has strategically placed holes on each side on the curved section, designed to aid suction.

Sucking, of course, being the primary stumbling block with milk-based products. \nThat's not the only reason for the new McDonald's straw. The 'Suction Tube for Reverse Axial Withdrawal' tool, or 'straw', was crafted with St. Patrick's Day in mind. (Photo: McDonald's) There are five things you should definitely never order from a coffee shop \nThe drinking aid is said to be perfect for the restaurant's Shamrock Shake, which is flavoured with both chocolate and mint . McDonald's says the straw allows the two flavours to be sucked up similtaneously. \nUpsettingly, the invention is only available in the US – and only 2,000 were made. It sucks (sorry). But the science behind it is interesting. Milkshake suction is something the fast food world has to contend with, so this, we hope, might be a step forward. (We've asked McDonald's if there are further plans). (Photo: McDonald's) Shoppers are raging after seeing Easter eggs on the shelves as early as Boxing Day \nThe straw was created at NK Labs in partnership with JACE. Principal engineer and managing partner Seth Newburg said: “It was a puzzling assignment but one with an ambitious goal. From a physics perspective, it's actually quite difficult to deliver a proportional amount of both chocolate and mint flavors with each sip. \n\"But that's exactly what we did. It's a marvel of fluid dynamics.
