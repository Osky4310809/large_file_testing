He was able to successfully exploit the bug, getting free rides in both locations. \nPrakash reported the issue through Uber’s bug bounty program , which rewards hackers with cash for finding and reporting security vulnerabilities. Many tech companies operate bug bounty programs as a way to strengthen the security of their products. Hackers can make between $100 – $10,000 at Uber depending on the severity of the bug and whether it impacts other users. The issue was reported and fixed in August, but Prakash waited until this week to publicly discuss the bug. \n“Attackers could have misused this by taking unlimited free rides from their uber account,” he explained in a blog post describing the issue. \nThe bug occurred when specifying a method of payment. Prakash showed in a proof-of-concept video that he could specify an invalid payment method, expressed in a simple string of characters like “abc” or “xyz,” and not be billed for the ride.

We appreciate Anand’s ongoing contributions and were happy to reward him for an excellent report,” an Uber spokesperson said.\nPrakash is ranked 14th in Uber’s bug bounty program, and frequently submits bug reports to other companies such as Twitter and Yahoo.
