As Barack and his family get set to vacate the White House, with Donald Trump lying in wait, last night saw the outgoing president deliver a highly emotive farewell address to the nation.\n\nSpeaking from Chicago, Obama delivered a wide-ranging speech which offered both optimism and caution for the times ahead. Trying to surmise the last tumultuous eight years in just over an hour is something over a Sisyphean task, but if anyone is able to do so in a laconic and elegant manner, it’s the outgoing Prez. Since taking office, Obama’s oratory skills have helped him transcend political status into something of a pop culture icon, and here was a reminder of the unparalleled steeze we’re all going to miss so much.\nTouching on issues such as race relations, terrorism, and of course, his own legacy, Obama’s words were met with hope, laughter, and tears. Loads and loads of tears — even from the president himself. If anyone was ever in need of a reminder that only real men cry, then this was it.\nGet your tissues at the ready and watch the speech in full above, before scrolling down to see some of the best reactions from social media.\nI can't even. #ObamaFarewell pic.twitter.com/Al4ctfnJ7Q \n— Kodi Gaddis (@KodiGaddis) January 11, 2017 \n\nMuch like this koala, I refuse to let go. #ObamaFarewell pic.twitter.com/u5Y9kPqWlZ \n— Marci Robin (@MarciRobin) January 11, 2017 \n\nI simply refuse to acknowledge that he is leaving and shall be in denial as long as trump is president #ObamaFarewell pic.twitter.com/KzsN44ZFVT \n— lil bri (@afemal3pr) January 11, 2017 \n\nDoes anyone else want to grab hold of Obama by the ankles & refuse to let him leave? #ObamaFarewell pic.twitter.com/PyxnUHxPCi \n— Amanda Buskill (@NeverKnitDrunk) January 11, 2017 \n\ni REFUSE to believe he's really leaving. 😭💔 #ObamaFarewell \n— erica {9 days} (@lovedwtspros) January 11, 2017 \n\nHe said Michelle's name and he's about to lose it.
