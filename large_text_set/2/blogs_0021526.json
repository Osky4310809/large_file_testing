Sun Microsystems seemed like a safe bet in the 1990s: Its motto was \" we're the dot in dot com .\" It later became infamous as the dot in the dot com bubble, after that bubble burst. \nSun's share price rose to $250 in 2000 before bottoming out at $10 just a couple of years later. The struggling business was acquired by Oracle in 2009. \nStocks are hit or miss. But when you hit, you can hit big, especially if you follow Warren Buffett's advice: You can make a lot of money in the market \" by owning good companies for long periods of time .\" show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:37:29.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
