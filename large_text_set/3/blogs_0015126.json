The brainchild of blade maker Green Beetle , the \"'Murica! Knife\" was, indeed, created using just iron, Tums, bacon, fries, beer, and \"dat large life,\" according to a video posted on YouTube: \nGreen Beetle turned iron into steel by carburizing it with Tums, which are made mostly of calcium carbonate. By \"baking\" crushed-up Tums and bars of iron together for two hours, you get red hot bars of steel. But don't try that at home, as you will need an oven that goes up to 1,900 degrees Fahrenheit. \nOnce the blade and handle have been forged and heat-treated, it's time to bring the temperature down. Turns out that steel likes to cool down the same way we all do: with a tall, cool pitcher of Budweiser. \nBut where do the fries and bacon come into play, you ask? Answer: in the handle, that's where. Green Beetle dipped the foods into a resin, providing users with a clear, sturdy handle. \nThis knife might not be razor-sharp, but it's ideal for cutting sheets of paper, Ã  la Chef Tony , and, of course, cheeseburgers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:57:25.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
