A century later, the cottage received a thorough renovation and a new wing, courtesy of Venice architect Michael Hricak. \nNow measuring approximately 2,800 square feet, the two-story home has four bedrooms and three baths. Features include hardwood floors, built-in seating and shelving, beveled glass windows, blindingly white walls, Carrara marble countertops, and high-end appliances. \nSliding glass doors lead to a backyard patio with built-in barbecue and fire pit. There’s also a rooftop deck offering picturesque palm tree-studded seaside views, a three-car garage, and space for up to four other vehicles. Last sold for $2.8 million in 2014, it’s now asking $2.985 million.\n16 Park Avenue [Halton Pardee + Partners] 16 Park Avenue [Estately] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:47:32.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
