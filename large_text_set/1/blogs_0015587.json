Liverpool fans think Man United’s goal was illegal \nBut, on the flipside, Liverpool fans felt Man United’s late leveller shouldn’t have stood. \nWhy? Because in the build up to Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s header, Antonio Valencia was spotted in an offside position on the right hand side. \nSee the tweets on Man United’s goal v Liverpool below.
