The data processing requires high calculation density and efficient threading distribution, followed by high speed, high bandwidth memory and disk subsystems. As a proprietary system, the cost would be nearer $50,000. Similar systems using a smaller version Supermicro Superworkstation SYS-7048A-T is possible for about $23,000. From HP or Dell it would cost over $30,000. \n“The CPU is a difficult choice given that the more cores the lower the clock speed, but the Xeon E5-2673 v4 20-core has a healthy 3.6GHz on the first two cores for a very good single-threaded performance and the all-core rate of 3.1GHz maintains a high-rate multi-threaded data stream that can benefit from a large amount of RAM. \n“GPUs today have substantial calculation density so the system integrating four GPUs will have a very high capability in the most demanding analytical and simulation applications. The GPU specification of this system can probably be improved by following the single Quadro P6000 driving the displays with three Tesla Pascal coprocessors, either P40 or P100. \n“The Supermicro X10DRG-Q motherboard is of a proprietary size to accommodate four double-height GPUs without covering the other PCIe slots, plus the volume of air required to cool the GPUs, the requirement for a substantial number of drives, and the need for this kind of system to operate quietly, meant that the Supermicro SuperWorkstation SYS-7048GR-TR is the ideal case/chassis for the system. It’s also convenient in that the user need only mount the CPUs, plug in the RAM, GPUs, and drives, saving substantial assembly, wiring, and configuration time. \nUpdate, 3/17/17, 7:00am PT: Fixed build name on $1,000 build.
