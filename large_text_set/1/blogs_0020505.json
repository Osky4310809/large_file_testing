(Scorecard) \nPreview: \nAs India switch gears to the shortest format, all eyes will be on the likes of seasoned campaigners Suresh Raina and Ashish Nehra -- making a comeback after almost a year's lay-off -- when the Men-in-Blue take on England in the three-match Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket series, starting with the first game at the Green Park Stadium here on Thursday. \nHaving pocketed the One-Day International (ODI) series 2-1, the Virat Kohli-led hosts will be aiming to make the most of their limited overs experience, as the T20I rubber is the last before the International Cricket Council (ICC) Champions Trophy from June 1.

Following that, will be the Indian Premier League (IPL) from April 3 to May 26, which will leave the national team very little time to regroup for the Champions Trophy in England. \nThe T20I series will also provide players, including the 30-year-old Raina and 37-year-old Nehra, a great opportunity to stake their claim for a berth in the 50-over side. ( Stats: England have edge over India in T20 Internationals ) \nBoth Nehra and Raina have been out of the national side since the ICC World T20 in March last year and will be eying the upcoming T20Is against England to stage a comeback. â€” BCCI (@BCCI) January 25, 2017 \nBesides the duo, the series will also be a test for the likes of promising batsmen Rishabh Pant, Mandeep Singh and Manish Pandey and the spin duo of Parvez Rasool and Yuzvendra Chahal. ( Dhoni's shot at redemption in T20 cricket ) \nGoing into Thursday's match, which will begin at 4.30 p.m. instead of the regular 7.30 p.m. start due to the prevailing dew and foggy conditions, the importance of the toss will be negated.
