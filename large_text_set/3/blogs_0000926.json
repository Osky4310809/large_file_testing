This has been true for all of Destiny ‘s DLC so far. Unfortunately, it appears that not all character progress will carry over to Destiny 2 .\n“Sequels represent the start of a new adventure for every player, with new worlds to explore, new stories to tell, new powers to acquire, new loot to earn, and much more,” said Bungie in a blog post . “This led us to a decision that would enable us to serve both the game and the player’s best interests: Destiny 1 power, possessions, and Eververse-related items and currency will not carry forward. They will, however, remain accessible to you in Destiny 1 .\n“We know that, just like us, you have grown fond of the Guardians you’ve created, so we do plan to preserve your character personalization. We are going to recognize the dedication and passion you’ve shown for this world. Specifically, the class, race, gender, face, hair, and marking selections for all characters that have achieved Level 20 and completed the Black Garden story mission will carry forward. We also plan to award those veteran accounts with honors that reflect your Destiny 1 accomplishments.\n“We believe this is the best path forward. It allows us to introduce the major advancements and improvements that all of us expect from a sequel, ensuring it will be the best game we can create, unencumbered by the past. We’re looking forward to sharing more details with you later this year for how we will honor your legacy in the future.”\nPowers, items, and currency will not carry forward to Destiny 2 . The blog post wasn’t clear on what “power and possessions” means. We’re going to have to presume it is abilities, light levels, weapons, and armor. The way your character looks will carry forward, but only for players who have reached level 20 and finished the Black Garden mission.\nDestiny ‘s final event will take place at the end of March. Bungie plans to hold a series of live stream showcases for “The Age of Triumph” to show everyone what it is all about. Dates for each of these events can be found at the bottom of the latest blog post .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T08:43:31.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
