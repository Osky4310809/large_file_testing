She preferred to be one-on-one with Taylor and didn't like being a part of the whole squad thing.\" \nAnd another added: \"Selena is not good friends with either Gigi or Bella. She knows them through other people, but they are just acquaintances. She is friendly with them, but not friends with them ... Selena and Gigi were never fond of each other, so Selena definitely doesn't have any stipulations about hooking up with or dating Bella's ex.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T05:37:21.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
