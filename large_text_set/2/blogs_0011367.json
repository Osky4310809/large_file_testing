Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA teenager was left looking like a 'frog' and almost blinded following a horrific allergic reaction to a hair dye. \nTylah Durie, 16, failed to do a patch test before applying the eyelash and eyebrow tint - leaving her eyes swollen to the size of 'balloons' and weeping with pus. \nThe terrified teen described the unbearable pain, which went on for four days, as 'like having beach sand thrown in your eyeballs and not being able to get it out, then a stinging like razorblades on my eyebrows'. \nHer peepers became so swollen that they shut, while at one point Tylah's family said she took on the appearance of an amphibian as medics warned she faced going blind.

Tylah is warning others to always perform a patch test before using a dye (Photo: Caters News Agency) \n\"I was hospitalised and was terrified, doctors said I had a very unusual but severe allergic reaction and could have gone permanently blind. \n\"I went through inexplicable pain just by tinting my eyelashes and eyebrows, I'm never using dye on myself ever again. \n\"I didn't realise I was allergic to Paraphenylenediamine, I did it to myself, I made a mistake and I'm now trying to protect others.\" \nThe teen says she was trying to tint her eyelashes and eyebrows – a beauty trend to make the areas look darker and fuller. \nShe admits her mistake was not doing a patch test on her skin. The manufacturers of the product clearly advise customers to perform an allergy patch test before using the kit (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nTylah said: \"When I applied the mixture I was fine, I waited 10 minutes and then washed it off – it looked really good and was really pleased with it. \n\"Because I didn't do a patch test, within half an hour the skin around my eyes became really itchy. \n\"No one really does the patch test in my family, so I thought I would be okay and hadn't suffered any reactions when dying my hair in the past, but those dyes didn't have PPD in them.\" \nThe next day, her reaction intensified and continued to worsen despite being prescribed antihistamines by her local hospital . Tylah described the pain as like 'razorblades' and having sand in her eyes (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nShe said: \"My eyes were swollen, but not as much as a couple of days later, they were bloodshot and all red. \n\"I was beginning to get blisters in my eyebrows which was really painful, then my eyelashes started falling out.\" \nAt her worst point, Tylah feared she was going blind while awaiting results of how badly the chemicals had burned her eyes. \nShe said: \"I had pus and tears coming out of my eye 24-seven and was left in a lot of pain and unexplainable discomfort. \n\"I was in shock, I was crying and really stressed, I was terrified of losing my eyesight at such a young age. \n\"An optometrist the next day told me how lucky I was not to have gone blind. \n\"Now I have to go to see them on a regular basis to monitor the lasting effects of the damage.\" Tylah was warned by doctors she faced going blind (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nAfter her horrific experience, the teen has vowed never to use any form of dye again and wants to stress the importance of patch tests to others. \nTylah said: \"I'm on a lot of medications to heal this and would never wish this pain on anyone, so please do a patch test. \n\"I was really scared by what happened, once you get one reaction from PPD it gets worse and worse each time. \n\"If it happens again it could either kill me or leave me permanently blinded. \n\"Now for my beauty course I will have to wear gloves in case I touch something that contains PPD. \n\"I tell everyone now to do a patch test and show them the pictures from my reaction as a warning.\" \nPPD can commonly be found in hair dyes and ink used for henna tattoos. \nGina Taro, a PPD allergy specialist, said: \"Reactions can be as small as redness around the edges of your face to itching of the eyes, all the way to chemical burns, blisters and your whole scalp feeling like it's melting off. \n\"Some people can suffer anaphylactic shock, where you have a small window before your throat closes and you die of suffocation, people have died because of PPD.\" \nOne unfortunate victim was teenager Tabatha McCourt, 17, from Airdrie, Lanarkshire, who lost her life after a severe reaction to PPD in 2011. \nGina, who writes a blog , says the amount of people at risk of a PPD reaction has dramatically risen over the years, with up to 75 per cent of women in the USA colouring their hair, and 6.5 per cent of those suffering an allergic reaction to PPD. \nJodie Phillips, from Chemcorp, the makers of the dye, said: \"Paraphenylenediamine or PPD is a common ingredient in hair dyes. \n\"It is well known that some people can be very sensitive to the ingredient and hence may find that such products are not compatible with their skin. \n\"The same is true for any ingredient used in cosmetics but more so with colouring agents. \n\"For this reason, all colouring products contain very specific and clear instructions that the consumer should carry out a patch test before using the product especially on sensitive areas such as eyebrows and lashes. \n\"We do advise to perform a skin sensitivity test 48 hours before every application of this product.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:42:26.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
