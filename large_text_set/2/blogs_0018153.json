While some of the pages were removed, others remained up but specific posts were deleted.\nSix of the 22 Facebook links in Warman’s complaint were no longer online, among them the Cultural Action Party, Canadians Against Justin Trudeau and Soldiers of Odin – Ontario South.\n“The reason I forwarded the list of Facebook profiles to their management in Canada is because they had been reported to me with concerns about hate speech,” Warman said.\nAccording to Facebook’s community standards code, the company removes content that “directly attacks” people based on their race, religion, sex or sexual orientation.\n“Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook,” it reads. “As with all of our standards, we rely on our community to report this content to us.”\nBut most of the links Warman had complained about were not taken down, despite having provocative names such as the Worldwide Coalition Against Islam and the Canadian Anti Islamic Force.\nNational Post \nsbell@nationalpost.com \nTwitter.com/StewartBellNP \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:37:52.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
