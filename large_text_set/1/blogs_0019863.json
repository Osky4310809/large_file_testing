Highlight of the day \nIn a spirited, confrontational interview on NBC’s Meet the Press , White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Chuck Todd that Spicer was using “alternative facts” in describing the inauguration crowd size, leading Todd to respond that the newly-coined phrase was just a euphemism for “falsehood.” Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway gets ready to go on television outside the White House, Sunday, Jan. 22, 2017, in Washington. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP \nPressed repeatedly on why Spicer was told to make easily disprovable claims about the inauguration crowd, Conway threatened that the White House would “rethink our relationship” with the media and continued to lambaste a pool reporter for mistakenly reporting that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. was removed from the White House — a report that he quickly corrected. \"Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods,\" Chuck Todd tells Pres. Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway this morning. WATCH: pic.twitter.com/Ao005dQ13r — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) January 22, 2017 \nConway also said that Trump will not release his tax returns because voters do not care what's in them, dispensing with a long-running line that Trump was not releasing the returns only because they are under audit. This Day in Trump, Day 2: All eyes on crowd size \nOn Fox News Sunday , Chris Wallace pressed White House chief of staff Reince Priebus over Trump’s claims that the crowds on the National Mall on Friday went as far back as the Washington Monument. Wallace said the entire premise of the conversation was “ridiculous” but demanded that Priebus explain Trump's and Spicer’s comments. Fact check \nA reporter for The Dallas Morning News stood directly at the foot of the Washington Monument as Trump took his oath of office Friday. While there were pockets of observers around the jumbotrons, the area was not “crowded” or “packed” by any definition of the words, as aerial photographs of the National Mall have confirmed. Here's a photo of a man near the Washington Monument yesterday watching the inauguration among the \"packed\" crowd: pic.twitter.com/Zi2huK90A5 — Jamie Lovegrove (@jslovegrove) January 21, 2017 By the numbers \nA former reality TV star known for his fixation on ratings, Trump boasted Sunday that more people watched his inauguration on TV than President Barack Obama’s second inauguration four years ago. Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017 \nWhile the 30.6 million that tuned in for Trump’s inauguration is more than the 20.6 million that tuned in for Obama’s second inauguration in 2013, 38 million viewed Obama’s first inauguration in 2009, according to Nielsen ratings. The record is held by President Ronald Reagan, who attracted a viewership of 42 million for his first inauguration in 1981. Tweeter in chief \nAfter millions of protesters took to the streets Saturday in women’s marches around the world, including hundreds of thousands in Washington, the president questioned whether the protesters even voted: Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017 \nBut then he emphasized that he respects the rights of protesters to demonstrate: Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017 Dissenting voices \nFormer Housing Secretary Julián Castro, who has become an outspoken social media critic of Trump , chided the president for his concern about the crowd sizes: Imagine if we had a president who cared more about improving the economy and education, instead of the size of his crowd. #TrumpPresident — Julián Castro (@JulianCastro) January 22, 2017 Texas ties \nFormer ExxonMobil chief executive and native Texan Rex Tillerson received a significant boost in his confirmation process for secretary of state on Sunday, as Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina — two of the Republicans most skeptical of Tillerson’s nomination — announced they would support him. \nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida is one of the last Republican holdouts on Tillerson’s nomination, at least on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But his concerns will no longer likely be enough to stop Tillerson’s ascent to the top diplomatic post. Star power \nAfter Spicer’s briefing room episode Saturday night and Conway’s “alternative facts” defense Sunday morning, Golden State Warriors basketball coach Steve Kerr joked in a postgame news conference that Spicer would inflate Kerr’s brief time as an Orlando Magic player to claim he was one of the best in franchise history.

San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich went on a lengthy tirade against the newly-sworn-in president before the team’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night. The rant — not the first time that Popovich has spoken out against Trump — prompted some to speculate that the five-time NBA champion may have a future career in politics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T03:03:58.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
