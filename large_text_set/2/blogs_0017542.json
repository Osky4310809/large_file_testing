I said: 'I don't know, I've eaten nothing all day, so I might give it a go later on,'\" Shaw admitted after the game. \n“As I say what is that, Sun Bets had us at 8-1 to eat a pie. I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it.

He said: “I think Wayne has become this global superstar on the back of being 23 stone. He’s made that a chance to make some more media coverage off the back of it. \n“The reality is I don’t know [if Shaw did it for a bet] but it wouldn’t surprise me. I don’t think it shows us in the best light.” \nThe FA refused to comment on a potential investigation. \nLucas Perez and Theo Walcott netted for the Gunners to set up a quarter-final match-up with National League side Lincoln.
