It is safe to say that the gator probably got the best catch of the day. \nThe video was captured by a woman named Norma Respess in Pasco County, Florida, and has subsequently gone viral. Nora was with her family to the Seven Springs Golf and Country Club in Trinity, when her husband pointed out the gator sighting. Norma grabbed her cellphone and began recording. \nIn the video, the gator can be seen walking nonchalantly across a sidewalk at the golf course with a massive fish in its grip. The fish is so big that it nearly drags on the ground as the gator walked clenching it in its jaws.
