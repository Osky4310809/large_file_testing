January 23, 2017 / 10:00 am By Munchies Staff \nOverrated: truffle oil. Accurately rated : tuna melts. Seriously underrated: onion dip. \nIs there anything more addictive? Throw us in front of a bowl of this stuff with a bag of Ruffles and we’re the hungriest and most helpless of binge-eaters. \nShould you choose to go deep on this party favorite, it pays to make your own instead of adhering to the old onion-soup-and-sour-cream version (though there’s plenty to be said about that, too). This recipe starts with real actual onion as well as onion flakes and onion powder. Hell, caramelized onions add a touch of sweetness and Worcestershire sauce add a serious pop of umami in this twist on a classic favorite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T18:39:52.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
