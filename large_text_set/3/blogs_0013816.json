(KFNS photo) \nTim McKernan has run a successful radio program, a company and even a sports-talk radio station. Full ownership of an outlet in that format could be next. \nRandy Markel bought 590 AM in a process that began in late 2015 when he in essence pulled it out of bankruptcy. Now Markel wants to sell the station to McKernan, who gained a 25 percent ownership stake in it in a transaction that took effect last September. Part of that deal included a provision that McKernan would receive $100,000 if the station is sold to another party, with the agreement he first would have the right to match that offer. \nBut Markel isn’t pursuing outside interests, as he has offered the station to McKernan — for $2.5 million he said, a substantial amount for a local AM radio station of that ilk. But Markel has invested heavily in the operation, including personnel and upgrading the towers that transmit the station’s signal . \n“The idea was to sell to Tim in four or five years,” Markel said this week. “But I thought, ‘Why not sell now?’ I will make a cool half a million dollars-plus in a (little over) a year. I’ve got $2 million in it, I want a half-million profit. That’s what I deserve.” \nSo talks have begun on the potential deal. \n“Having the right of first refusal to buy the station was and is one of the most important elements of my contract when we agreed to the deal last year,” McKernan said. “After we have been lucky enough to have a large group of people play a role in building this business (insideSTL Enterprises, LLC) over the last number of years, we wanted to make sure we would have the option to control our own destiny. From the beginning, Randy has said publicly that he expected me to be the majority owner one day. In his mind, it wasn’t ‘if.’ It was ‘when.’ That’s why he named the company (McKernan Radio Group) after me when he created the new business. \n“He called me Sunday night and said that if I would like to buy his shares now, he would be interested in discussing it. He said, ‘I’d be thrilled to see you own the majority of this station. At the same time, if you don’t want to do it yet, I’d be thrilled to keep my shares and keep building the station.’” \nMarkel owns the Chuck’s Boots stores in the St. Louis area, which he said he also is in the process of selling, and is building a youth baseball complex at the Lake of the Ozarks on a 239-acre site just west of Camdenton, Mo. \nHis point men for that project are former St. Louis radio talk-show hosts Bob Ramsey and Jeff Vernetti. Ramsey, still the radio voice of St. Louis University men’s basketball, said the facility is set to have nine fields and is intended to draw teams from all over the country as families can combine a vacation with the kids’ on-field activities. He added that the hope is to have some tournaments take place later this year, with the next phase to add soccer and lacrosse fields. \nOn a recent trip to Branson, Mo., Markel said he saw a similar facility that convinced him an additional investment was needed in his project. He said he originally committed $1 million, but now plans to double that. \n“Theirs are really cool, but ours will be the ultimate,” Markel said. “I had to make a decision — do I want to go all-in with the radio station or all-in with the ballparks? I couldn’t do both unless I sold Chuck’s Boots, but that still is in the works” and could take some time. “I thought about it, the radio station has the potential to be great, and in Tim’s hands. That’s what he’s always wanted (to own his own sports station). I said, ‘You come up with 1½ million (dollars), I will finance the other million at 6 percent, over 1-3 years, at interest only.” \nHow long can Markel wait for McKernan to complete the deal? \n“A month, two months,” he said. “A million and a half dollars shouldn’t be hard for him to come up with, especially with the circles he runs in. He knows some money people.” \nMcKernan, who said the financial aspects are “something that we would not want to discuss publicly,” sounds cautious in his approach to the situation. \n“A move of this magnitude would take time if we were to pursue it,” he said. “But based on the combination of the caliber of lineup we now have along with off-air elements such as the new studio Randy is building in Kirkwood next to our restaurant (that will be tied to station promotions) and the podcasts we will be launching this year, we have a variety of pieces in place that make the discussion an intriguing one.” \nMarkel and McKernan have not always agreed on the on-air lineup decisions, of which Markel has final say. In recent months, KFNS has added Martin Kilcoyne, Charlie Marlow, Cam Janssen and T.J. Moe, among others. \nAll of this for a station that once was the top sports-talk radio station in town before tumbling into turmoil and debt before going off the air until Markel took it over. \n“The hardest part in my opinion is done,” Markel said. “I like building things, I don’t like to maintain. ... The building is done, now it’s time to start selling” advertising for the station. “That doesn’t interest me, it’s time to move on and build the ballparks.” \nAnd Markel, a tall-talking Texan, had a wisecrack about McKernan: “He’s ecstatic, he’s probably glad to get rid of me.” DINO DEPARTS \nRound 2 of “Dino Days” in St. Louis was even shorter than the first episode. And a whole lot quieter. \nA year ago this month, Dino Costa rode into to St. Louis with the bravado of an old wild west gunslinger, vowing to conquer the local sports-talk radio landscape in KFNS’ morning drive-time slot. \n“If I don’t dominate this market in a year, I will crawl on hands and knees back to Wyoming,” he said then after being hired by Markel. “.... The worst thing that ever happened to other people in sports radio is the arrival of Dino Costa. The salad days are over. I have nothing personal against any of these guys but I have to destroy them, I will destroy them, and I will dominate this market. I will be No. 1. I’m so confident of this, it’s already happened in my mind.” \nHe took his cocky, take-no-prisoners approach to the airwaves and social media, as he issued personal attacks against hosts not only at other stations but also on KFNS. It certainly drew attention, but actually detracted from his delivery as a crisp, high-energy, well-read broadcaster who was able to juggle sports, politics and social issues — punctuating his many takes with an edge — unlike anyone else in the market and few in the country. \nBut like a sagebrush blowing across the Wyoming grasslands, he quickly disappeared. We don’t know if he actually headed out on his hands and knees, but six weeks later he was on his way back to the Cowboy State. \nHe didn’t like what looked like a pending change in KFNS’ management structure — something that came to fruition several months later when McKernan came aboard. When Costa came to town, McKernan was running the weekday operations at WGNU (920 AM), where the “Morning After” show he co-hosts was airing before moving with him to KFNS. \nSo Costa was gone — but not for good. After covering University of Wyoming football, he returned to St. Louis last month in a much more low-key manner, doing an online show from a studio in St. Peters. He was backed by Markel and Right Side Broadcasting Network in unrelated deals. Right Side pulled out first, then Markel did so recently. So by Wednesday Costa was heading back to Wyoming, less than 3½ weeks after launching. (The shows, which contain coarse language, are online at thedinoreport.com in the archives link.) \n“Doing this from scratch is a very difficult proposition no matter what,” he said. “Doing it without long-term capital and commitment is virtually impossible.” \nHe regrets that he wasn’t able to form a business partnership with Markel, whom he praises. \n“I understand where he’s coming from and what he wants to do with the ballparks,” Costa said. “But I still don’t know what it’s like to partner with Randy long term, and that’s the biggest disappointment to me. The man has an incredible ear for talent, he’s a renegade. He goes against the grain of the standard and conventional radio operators, and in this day and age it’s utterly refreshing” and he will be missed in the business. \nCosta originally came to St. Louis after being fired from Sirius XM Radio, and acknowledges that his two brief stints here might not look good for those “on the outside. It probably looks a lot more gloomy that what reality is.” \nCosta ultimately hopes to return to satellite radio. \n“My mission is pretty big,” he said. “I think I made several mistakes in the last few years, certainly at Sirius XM (where he complained about the company’s lack of promoting his show). The way I look at it, if Steve Jobs can find his way back to Apple — the impossibility of that — then why can’t Dino Costa some day find his way back to Sirius XM?
