We’ll see. \n“You know, I’m just going to enjoy the show. That’s what I’m going to do.” \nStone looked equally as unimpressed when Ball referenced the news that she is set to play Cruella de Vil in Disney's upcoming 101 Dalmatians spin-off. \n“I’ll just say the one word to you – Cruella,” Ball said. (Bafta) \nStone replied: “What about her?” \nAfter Ball asked whether or not it was happening, the actress remained tight-lipped and said: “We will see, it’s very early so we’ll see how it all pans out.” British Academy Film Awards 2017 British Academy Film Awards 2017 1/42 \nDuchess of Cambridge and Prince William Daniel Leal-Olivas- WPA Pool/Getty Image 2/42", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:45:12.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
