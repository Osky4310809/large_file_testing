This is great for those who don’t want to sift through hundreds of individual commits, and even better for those who wouldn’t understand the commits in the first place.\nEarlier this month we saw that LineageOS added a feature called Single Hand Mode , but these latest updates have focused on their custom Quick Settings tiles.\nWe’re told that these custom Quick Settings tiles are now back and we also get a list of what Quick Settings tiles we now have access to. So, if you have an updated version of LineageOS on your device then you can look forward to the following Quick Settings tiles: Caffeine, USB Tether, Sync, Battery Saver, Ambient Display, Heads Up, Volume Panel, and ADB over Network. These are right where you expect them to be and they should all work unless your device is having a specific conflict with said feature.\nWe also learned that since the March 6th builds of LineageOS, they have now been able to add the Android security patches for the month of March. Many Android devices haven’t even received these patches from their official OEM yet so that is always nice to see. Since the March 6th builds, we are also able to store contacts locally onto our device regardless of what contacts provider we have available. This month we even saw LineageOS pass the 1 million install counter (although this number won’t be 100% accurate).\nAs far as build roster is concerned, the maintainers are no longer active for the Huawei Ascend Mate 2 (mt2), HTC One (GSM) (m7) and HTC One (Verizon) (m7vzw) so they have had to remove these devices. On the other hand, the Galaxy S4 (Verizon) ( jfltevzw), Galaxy S4 (Intl) (jfltexx) , LG G5 (Intl) (h850), and LG V20 (T-Mobile) (h918) are now getting official builds of LineageOS 14.1. We’re also seeing the Droid 4 (maserati), Droid RAZR (CDMA) (spyder), Droid Bionic (targa), Droid RAZR (GSM) (umts_spyder), and Motorola Photon Q (xt897) receive official builds of LineageOS 13 now.\nSource: LineageOS ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:13:03.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
