Patients whose immune systems were permanently weakened by HIV before their treatment began, or those who had not fully adhered to treatment regimens when they were on them, would be among the first to die if their antiretroviral treatment was stopped. Only about half of European patients diagnosed with HIV when they had significantly weakened immune systems were able to survive more than a year in the 1980s, before antiretroviral treatment was available. That suggests a good chance some of the first deaths that could be directly linked with PEPFAR cuts would happen within a year of their passage. If PEPFAR ended antiretroviral coverage to a third of the 11m people currently receiving drugs, the death toll would head towards 3m. Many of those on treatment are pregnant women and new mothers. Cutting antiretroviral distribution would lead to an increase in HIV positive AIDS orphans—and it would be possible to name the people who died because of the cuts, as well as their children. This all suggests that direct consequences of cuts may be relatively hard to sell politically. Other aid-financed activities that might save more lives at a lower cost don’t share this feature of direct culpability for specific deaths. America is also a major financier of global efforts to fight malaria, for example. In Zambia, spending a dollar on bed nets to prevent malaria transmission is 33 times as effective as spending it on antiretroviral drugs in terms of death and disability prevented. But while malaria deaths will go up if America cuts funding, it will not be possible to point to an individual malaria sufferer and say that his or her illness is a direct and immediate result of a budget cut. That said, even the non-PEPFAR aid budget may not be as easy to slash as the administration hopes. Whatever is left of those aid programmes that have already survived a ten-year budget decline, from 0.23% of GDP in 2005 to 0.17% in 2015, are the parts that are harder to kill. Health aid as a whole is popular with the public even if unspecified aid flows are not. The $7bn in humanitarian assistance has bipartisan emotional appeal and there are strong constituencies for continued support to countries that include Afghanistan ($2bn) and Jordan ($1bn), for example. This is why Republicans including Senators Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio have come out against reducing the aid budget and why Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has predicted that a large cut shouldn’t make it through Congress. And if cutting the least popular part of government spending turns out to be harder than it looks at first, it suggests the complexity of other efforts to rein in spending. That is why the first budget of the Trump administration, due to be unveiled on March 16th, may end up looking less like its original design than it does like the last budget of the Obama administration.
