Greater L.A.'s rank on the all-new Global Traffic Scorecard is based on the estimated time the average local motorist spent stuck in traffic during peak commuter hours in 2016. That number is 104 hours. Moscow came in second place with 91; New York nabbed third place with 89. Traffic costs the average L.A. driver $2,408 a year in productivity and fuel, the firm found. \n\"This scorecard takes all roads into account to give a more accurate reflection of a the typical trip,\" says Inrix senior economist Bob Pishue. Traffic in other global cities can be \"more severe\" for shorter periods, \"but people in L.A. tend to sit in it longer,\" he says.

Gas prices have been more than reasonable in the last year, parking is relatively plentiful, particularly in the suburbs, and toll roads are still rare. \"If it costs more to travel, people do less of it,\" he says. \nLos Angeles shows up in the fifth spot on an accompanying list of the most congested roads in the United States, with the 10 east from the 405 to the 110 representing our worst. New York's 95 west is number one. Chicago's 90/94 took second place. \nEven though the United States made a strong showing on the congested global cities ranking, Thailand is the most traffic-ridden nation in the world overall, followed by Columbia, Indonesia and Russia, according to the report. The United States tied for fourth with Russia. \nInrix is not taking a stand on solutions, which could range from the expansion of public transportation to higher parking rates . \n\"We want public officials, transportation officials, drivers and employers to take a look at this to see how it effects the commute,\" Pishue says. \"Maybe an employer says we should shift our hours or do more telecommuting. Maybe bus routes are expanded. The solution is different for each city.\" Inrix", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:41:26.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
