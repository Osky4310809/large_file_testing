Michelle Williams’s peroxide pixie was worn slick and deeply side-parted—a delicate black bow at the neck and a porcelain complexion striking a deeply feminine chord. \nIt was a cool, not-a-hair-out-of-place notion echoed by Jessica Biel and Zoe Saldana’s ladylike tie-backs. Elsewhere, glistening drop earrings pulled focus to Emily Ratajkowski’s abbreviated waves, her chop offset by a makeup palette of warm, peachy tones. And celebrating Atlanta ’s nomination was Zazie Beetz, whose free-form textured mane, glinting modern jewels, and cheeky dots of onyx pigment beneath her lower lashes seemed destined to elicit a double take during her Golden Globes overture—a risk-taking approach we hope to see more of throughout the coming award season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T06:26:57.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
