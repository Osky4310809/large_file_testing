Like all of you, we are shocked and appalled. Despite earlier rumblings to the contrary, Marcus Rashford is alive and well and makes his return to the starting line-up. Mourinho obviously read Andi’s post and went for the last option. Here's how #MUFC will line up this evening... pic.twitter.com/VYZ5WMR4oN — Manchester United (@ManUtd) March 13, 2017 The 5 at the back formation that got a trial run during the thriller in Rostov rears its ugly head again tonight, with Phil Jones , Chris Smalling , and Marcos Rojo reprising their roles as accidents waiting to happen. Out wide, the always dependable Antonio Valencia is back in the side, with...*squints*...Matteo Darmian (?!) on the on opposite flank. Paul Pogba and Ander Herrera are tasked with the midfielding, as per usual. Up front, Henrikh Mkhitaryan is tasked with probably creating something out of very little, behind the aforementioned Rashford, and alongside utility man Ashley Young. Unless Young is playing in midfield. God alone knows. On the bench, Juan Mata is available for a bit of magic, and Marouane Fellaini is available for elbows and tallness. Chelsea line-up as expected. Hopefully N’Golo Kante is distracted by having left the stove on. Chelsea team tonight: Courtois; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Cahill (c); Moses, Kante, Matic, Alonso; Willian, Diego Costa, Hazard. #CHEMUN — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) March 13, 2017 You can get a Chelsea fan’s take on the match-up here , and also check out my Q&A over at We Ain’t Got No History .
