Jennifer Aniston introduced it, while Sara Bareilles performed a musical tribute. \nOm Puri , who has worked in several Hollywood films, was one of those honoured in the montage. Other legends like Carrie Fisher, Prince, Bill Nunn, Curtis Hanson and more were also remembered. \nHis family has now released a statement, expressing their gratitude: \nThe only Indian actor to have worked consistently in Hollywood and British cinema for the last 25 years, without a fuss and letting his work speak for itself, today the Academy of Motion Pictures acknowledged his contribution at its 89th Awards. The first and only Indian actor to be acknowledged thus. Thank you Academy. Thank you everyone. We miss you Om. We miss you lots. Ishaan and Nandita Puri. \nA great gesture indeed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:23:37.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
