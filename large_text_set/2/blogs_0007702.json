The vehicle will test the limits of Tesla’s production capability, since the company’s CEO Elon Musk has said they’re targeting production volume of 500,000 cars per year by 2018, in response to strong demand for the Model 3. Tesla is currently making around 100,000 vehicles per year, based on its production total for the final quarter of 2016. \nTest production of the vehicle could help the company finalize design details, a process which sources told Reuters is still underway. The stated production start date target for the Model 3 is July 2017, a date which is considered very ambitious given internal progress, according to Reuters’ sources. Musk himself has also noted that these dates may change depending on supplier ability to meet Tesla’s requirements. \nTesla faces more pressure than ever regarding getting Model 3 production underway, since Chevrolet has made good on its promise to produce and begin sales of its own Bolt EV with a 200+ mile range and price tag under $30,000 once you bake in green car incentives. The company also has a lot to prove in terms of investors, so any signal it can provide that it’s on its way to production at scale will be welcome. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:46:12.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
