But don't be alarmed, chaps – that also includes foreplay. Ten minutes, to be exact. \nPeople told sex toy retailer Lovehoney that just over half (52 per cent) of intimate moments lasted 'the right' amount of time. 19 minutes seems fair, no? Just enough time to order a pizza and wait for it to arrive, essentially. Works out well. \nJust 15 per cent of women polled said they'd prefer a bit longer in bed. As ever, though, the study was restricted to a limited pool – 4,400 people this time. Sizeable, but worth remembering.

Time constraints – maybe the pizza came early? – often force lovers to go in and out like the SAS . \nThe study also discovered that 89 per cent of couples have managed to orgasm at the same time. Quite a feat, especially considering a vast proportion of women (more than 11 per cent) can't orgasm by way of penetrative sex at all). \nStill. Researchers combated this point by saying that couples achieve shared orgasms by allowing one partner to get to the 'trigger point' and then waiting for the other to catch up. \nThree quarters of men said they orgasm almost every time they have sex, meanwhile, compared to 28 per cent of women.
