Image copyright Pinterest Image caption \"Chopsticks sticking straight up into rice or noodles can be seen as offensive in some Asian cultures,\" says Noche \nNoche added that established food blogs like that of Andrew Zimmern also fed into stereotypes. \n\"(His) recipe for Filipino short ribs is styled with chopsticks even though Filipinos traditionally eat with spoons and forks or their hands\". \nZimmern has not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing. \nSimilarly the food site Bon Appetit received some criticism for publishing a video last year about noodles claiming \"Pho is the new Ramen.\" Several commenters attacked the video for the \"simplification of Asian culture\" as \"pho is from Vietnam and ramen from Japan\". \nThe video was fronted by a white American chef who spoke on the 'correct way to eat pho\". Image copyright Facebook Image caption Messages under Bon Appetit's video \"Pho is the new Ramen\" \nAfter a little more than 24 hours on the website Bon Appetit removed the video altogether, both from their Facebook and YouTube channels, and apologised for any offence they may have caused. \nNoche's assertion comes at a time of much discussion about the so-called \"cultural misrepresentations\" of food. \nPembroke College of Cambridge university said they were taking complaints from ethnic minority students about their menu \"seriously\". \n\"Dear Pembroke catering staff, stop mixing mango and beef and calling it 'Jamaican stew',\" a student posted on the college's Facebook page. \"I'm actually half Jamaican, pls show me where in the Caribbean they mix fruit and meat.\" \nAnother complained about a \"Tunisian rice\" recipe which, well, doesn't exist in Tunisia. \nThe college said they would be \"going through the dishes on the menu to see if any are ones that are not very well named\". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pembroke College Cambridge \nHowever, not everyone agreed. \nEvening Standard journalist Sam Leith wrote \"And if, in an age when basic civilisational freedoms are under threat, the next generation of highly educated students is devoting its attention to complaining about whether their lunch is authentic enough, God help us all.\" \nSome Facebook commenters agreed with him, saying that the famous college had \"been blind sided by politically correct Nazis\". Image copyright Celeste Noche Image caption Celeste Noche \nNoche however, feels that the issue speaks to a wider discussion on the portrayal of minorities. \n\"We need to break away from the idea that white and western is the base standard for media portrayals - whether in food, film, literature, etc - and start trusting and hiring people of colour to represent themselves.\" \nBlog by ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T08:04:52.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
