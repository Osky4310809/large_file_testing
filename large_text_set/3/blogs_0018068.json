(HISTORY/Youtube)   3:00 PM \nVince Jones, from History channel’s “Big Rig Bounty Hunters,” passed away inside his Delaware, Ohio home Tuesday night from what family members believe to be a heart attack. He was 46. \nTMZ first reported the news, after speaking with Vince’s mother Kathy Smith on the mournful matter. \nKathy told the gossip site her son, who was diagnosed with sleep apnea last year — was heard making strange sounds in his bed around 4 a.m., when his wife noticed he was barely breathing and attempted to wake him from sleep. \nThe wife reportedly performed CPR with the help of her 14-year-old son, but the efforts were unsuccessful. \nChuck Barris, 'Dating Game' and 'Gong Show' creator, dies at 87 \nVince was not wearing his oxygen mask at the time, which the family believes could have prompted the pause in his breathing. \nCo-star and fellow bounty hunter on the show Shawn Zimmerman said Vince was like a brother to him. \n“Vince is my best friend,” Zimmerman said in a 2013 clip. “He’s a brother of mine. I mean, I look at him more like family than I do friend.” \nVince is survived by his wife and six children.
