We should remind our American friends of their own motto: United we stand, divided we fall.\" EU unsettled - by Damian Grammaticas, BBC News, Brussels \nDonald Tusk doesn't speak for European leaders. His role is to chair their debates and focus their minds on the biggest issues facing the EU. \nThe way he always does that is by speaking bluntly. \nWhat's striking is that he's added \"worrying declarations by the new American administration\" to his list of external challenges facing Europe. He does place it lowest, but in Donald Tusk's view the EU is under pressure from all sides. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump has alarmed some European leaders by raising questions about Nato \nAnd now, he's saying, the EU can no longer be sure of the support of its biggest ally too. \nDonald Trump has professed doubts about Nato, admiration for Russia's Vladimir Putin and support for Brexit. He has also criticised German Chancellor Angela Merkel, particularly her welcoming policy towards refugees. \nSo Mr Tusk's letter is a sign of how unsettled EU leaders are by Donald Trump, unsure about what his presidency heralds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T18:44:55.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
