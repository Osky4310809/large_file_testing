I can completely understand where North Melbourne are heading in that direction. \n“It doesn’t mean that I agree with it and, to be brutally honest, I didn’t agree with it at the time.” \nThat direction North took was one without Dal Santo and three other Roo veterans in Brent Harvey, Drew Petrie and Michael Firrito. \nThe quartet was surprisingly axed by the club just days out from the final round of the home and away season. They wouldn’t be offered a North Melbourne contract for 2017. Nick Dal Santo played his final AFL game in North Melbourne’s elimination final loss to Adelaide. Picture: Tom Huntley Source: News Corp Australia \nWhile the Roos’ actual decision to cut the quartet was expected to a certain extent, it was the timing of the announcement and the way it had been released to the public — via a mid-morning press release — that caught many off-guard. Some were even offended. \nSo, in hindsight, if Dal Santo had been in North Melbourne’s shoes, would he have done anything differently? \n“Given myself a new contract,” he laughed. \n“But apart from that, no. I was really comfortable knowing upfront. I wanted to know pretty much as soon as I could. \n“It was probably dragging out behind closed doors a little bit longer. I feel (the Kangaroos) were probably trying to work through a process and come to some sort of understanding internally about what direction they wanted to go in the future and whether that included the senior, older players at the footy club. But that’s fine, that’s their prerogative, that’s their choice. \n“I was shown a lot of respect by (coach) Brad Scott coming to my house and talking through it the way he did, so I have no issue with that at all. \n“I have got a really good relationship with Brad and was able to voice my thoughts with him and have a really good conversation. We both walked away comfortable with the work that we did together over that three-year period.” \nTHE CHANCE OF A SECOND CHANCE \nLike the rest of his teammates, Dal Santo had no choice. He had to move on — and move on quickly from the news, because the Roos had a crunch final to play in a few weeks. \nAt the same time, the thought of playing on at a third AFL club lingered. \nAfter featuring in 22 of North Melbourne’s past 23 games while averaging 24.8 disposals per match — ranked No. 1 at the club in 2016 — Dal Santo believed he had more left to give. \nAbove all, he was fit — both mentally and physically. \nTwo nights before North’s elimination final against Adelaide, Dal Santo admitted publicly that he was open to continuing his AFL career elsewhere. This particularly came in the wake of him being strongly linked to Collingwood. \nThe Dal Santo-Collingwood partnership made sense, too. The Pies desperately needed an experienced head to help guide a young list, as well as an accurate kick to address their glaring efficiency issues. \nBut things changed quickly following the Adelaide final and Dal Santo’s thinking shifted.

Flanked by his fellow axed veterans while cradling son Jude, he knew it was the perfect way to finish up. This had to be the end. \n“Walking off the ground after we lost that final in Adelaide, knowing that it was probably and realistically the last time I was going to play footy at AFL level, it was, in some ways, a nice closure to know that my wife, my son and my family were all there. It was a nice way to say goodbye and say, ‘That’s the end’,” he said. \n“I was conscious that that was probably the last time. I was still open to the idea of playing on, as I felt like my body and my mind could have gone on for at least 12 more months and I felt like I had solid football left in me. \n“But I remember (Adelaide on-baller) Rory Sloane shaking my hand and saying a couple of really nice words and I thought, ‘OK, that’s probably it for me’. \n“It had been 15 years, I’d played over 320 games, made some friends that will be friends forever, some memories that I will never forget. It’s been a pretty good ride.” \nPublicly, Dal Santo continued to be discussed as a potential free agent option for a rival club following North’s finals exit. \nPrivately, though, he knew his time was up. \nSo it was almost appropriate that as Dal Santo reflected on his final walk off the Adelaide Oval that Collingwood’s interest in recruiting him diminished. \n“There were definitely conversations early, but it just didn’t progress very far at all. And when they sort of died off, that was it,” he said. Nick Dal Santo averaged more disposals than any other North Melbourne player in 2016.

As that time went on, we just worked through it and I had to retire. That’s the way it goes. \n“There’s not that many guys that get to walk out on their own terms. It wasn’t necessarily on my own terms, but it was pretty close.” \nPOST-FOOTY LIFE \nSince retiring and enjoying a holiday with his wife and Jude, Dal Santo has found contentment. \nHe reckons he hasn’t “missed out on anything just yet” and believes he’s well prepared for post-footy career life. \nBut he’s also anticipating a time in the near future when he’ll have itchy feet. \n“It’s funny, because as hard as pre-seasons are, I never hated them,” he said. \n“The work is extremely difficult, you’re exhausted for pretty much three months in a row. But I always enjoyed going to training, being part of the group, training really hard with the boys and working towards getting ready for the season. \n“I absolutely miss that, I miss getting up and going to training and seeing 40 guys every day — 10 of them are your best mates. I really miss that camaraderie.” \nTo help ease those mini feelings of angst, he has kept in regular contact with some St Kilda and North Melbourne players. \nTrying to find a time to meet up with them, however, has proven to be a challenge. \n“It does feel weird when no one can catch up with me for a coffee or breakfast mid-week,” Dal Santo laughed. \nMOVING INTO THE MEDIA \nThings have quickly already fallen into place post-retirement for Dal Santo, who will form an integral part of the SEN and Crocmedia radio call teams in 2017. \nA naturally strong and confident communicator with ample AFL wisdom and stories to tell, Dal Santo should slot into the footy media landscape with aplomb. \nHe’s particularly looking forward to sitting in padded seats behind the third-level glass and watching close mate Leigh Montagna strut his stuff for the Saints. \n“I’ll be an armchair critic when it comes to Joey,” Dal Santo laughed. \n“I have always loved football, so to be able to stay involved in some small way with me being in the media, it really excites me to be able to go to football games and just watch the game from a completely different angle. Nick Dal Santo has joined the SEN commentary team alongside Anthony Hudson, Danny Frawley and Garry Lyon.

I’ve actually really enjoyed the tactics of the game and how it’s changed over the years.” \nDal Santo’s media commitments mean he won’t be able to play local footy in 2017, barring a few “social games”. \nBut there are other hurdles stopping him from having a regular kick. \n“I just feel like my body needs a bit of a rest. I’ve been doing it for a long time,” he said. \n“There are other things I love doing and my family is really important to me. We’ve got another child coming in seven or eight weeks, so I’ve got to try and balance that out as well.” \nPart of that balance, no doubt, will include some time for reflecting, especially on the good times. \nNick Dal Santo was speaking from Mercury Cider’s Tough Tap on Tour , which was launched at the Phillip Island Hotel on Saturday.
