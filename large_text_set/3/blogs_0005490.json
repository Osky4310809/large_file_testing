But when the partying ends up taking a dark turn and they accidentally kill a male stripper, the longtime friends are forced to put their heads together and cover up the accident.\n“It’s hilarious,” McKinnon tells PEOPLE of the script, penned by Broad City ‘s Paul W. Downs and Lucia Aniello. (Colton Haynes, Demi Moore and Ty Burell round out the film’s cast.) The Saturday Night Live Emmy winner also dishes on her costars — take a look at their individual posters (with clues about their characters) below!\nScarlett Johansson “Scarlett Johansson is a great actress — really funny,” McKinnon says. “She improvises really funny stuff and it’s really rare to find the two rolled into one. And it’s such a cool thing to watch her just work. I sort of just sit there and go, ‘Wow, look at that.’ ” Zoë Kravitz \n“Zoë Kravitz is a great lady. Blair is so uptight and Zoë is so cool in real life,” McKinnon reveals. “I think that her coolness in real life is adding another dimension to this character and it’s really cool to watch.”\nIlana Glazer “Ilana Glazer is what we call a spitfire,” McKinnon says. “You give her something to do and she just — it snaps, it crackles, it pops. She makes everything so much her own and she’s such a cool character in real life. I’ve known her for so long and she just always brings all of herself to it. And she’s so magnetic to watch.”\nJillian Bell “You’d be hard-pressed to find a funnier person,” McKinnon admits. “Jillian Bell is just improvising the funniest stuff I’ve ever heard. And she brings an absolute manic sincerity and devotion to this character that is so grounded and believable.” \nKate McKinnon McKinnon’s character, meanwhile, is labeled the “party down under” with a jar of Vegemite sticking out of it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:08:37.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
