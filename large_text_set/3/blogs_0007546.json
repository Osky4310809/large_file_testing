The company has released skins for current smartphones such as the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, and is now back to announce Galaxy S8 skins and Galaxy S8+ skins . \nThe announcement was made from DBrand’s own Twitter page (no leakster tipoffs here), showing a carbon fiber skin with cutouts for the flash, camera, and back-mounted fingerprint sensor, a first for the Korean giant, who’s physical home button has borne an embedded fingerprint sensor since smartphones such as the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4 from 2014. The back-mounted fingerprint sensor for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ has been leaked in multiple photos and videos . \nThe top of the DBrand post also shows the names of the devices, “Galaxy S8″ and “Galaxy S8+,” which further confirms the “S8+” moniker that was revealed by way of an official logo some weeks ago. There’s even more to expect from the Galaxy S8 than this, but it’s nice to see official declarations by top partners. \nThat’s all that DBrand tells us here, but it’s a good sign that renders are now giving way to tangible proof of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+’s existence. It’s expected that case and skin makers like DBrand would prepare themselves for the phones’ arrival to market – since Samsung is scheduled to unveil the next Galaxy on March 29th .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T08:19:27.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
