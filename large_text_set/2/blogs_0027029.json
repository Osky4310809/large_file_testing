Enjoy tonight boys!! # DontTakeMeHome # TogetherStronger.\" \nIn the interview, Bale talks about the close bond between Welsh fans and players that was at the heart of the astonishing run. \n\"To see the film, it did bring back all those great memories,\" he said. \n\"It's a kind of underdog story and everyone loves an underdog. It just shows how passionate one nation can be and how together they can be and what you can achieve when everyone's pulling in the same direction. \n\"The film itself brings together both sides of the story. \n\"It really shows how we all connect. Us players, we're all Wales fans, we're the same as the fans. The film shows what amazing chemistry we have as a country.\" \nThe film tells the story of a remarkable few weeks in France as Wales shook the footballing world.

Having gone through the grief of previous manager Gary Speed’s tragic death, heavy defeats, and positioned as a tiny country team with no pedigree, all bets were off for how the underdogs would perform.
