One is tropically sweet while the other is spicy. But I was experimenting with leftovers and found this combo to be surprisingly tasty. Advertisement \nI was looking for a way to cook some leftover pineapple I had and found a recipe for roasted pineapple coated in brown sugar and cinnamon. Sounded a little weird, but there’s was little risk to giving it a try, so I did. You guys, it was so good. The first piece wasn’t what I was expecting, forward on the cinnamon with an ending flavor of pineapple, but I couldn’t stop eating them once I started. I had to just walk away from the kitchen so I didn’t end up eating half a pineapple on my own. Turns out this combo is common in Brazilian cuisine. \nBesides trying this out as an even sweeter way to enjoy pineapple, I recommend throwing it into stir fry. My boyfriend did this with the last couple chunks and it added some serious depth to the dish. The brown sugar caramelized in the pan and the cinnamon bloomed. The taste reminded me a lot of Chinese five spice powder , which elevated the fried rice to another level.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:06:30.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
