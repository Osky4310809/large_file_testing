We’d listen to Stewart read a phone book—or moo like several different cows —so this is right up our alley, all else aside.\nIt’s extra fitting, considering Stewart’s voice was apparently originally used in test footage for the 1996 movie. The franchise has been plugging away with non-theatrical sequels in the meantime in order to finally fulfill Patrick Stewart’s dragon destiny/because people are watching them. If you’ve given up on certain other franchises featuring dragons, perhaps this will be able to provide your fix when it debuts on disc-based media and On Demand on June 13.\n(via ComingSoon.net , image via screengrab)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
