NEW: President Donald J. Trump Statement Regarding Recent Executive Order Concerning Extreme Vetting pic.twitter.com/psbegV3vA9 — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) January 29, 2017 ***Original Post*** \nWe were all waiting for President Trump to chime in on Americans' uproar over his executive order on the refugee vetting process. On Friday, he enforced a temporary ban on travelers from seven nations in the Middle East and Africa, as well as an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria. \nAs expected, Trump has offered his explanation via Twitter. One need only look at the terror attacks in Europe to realize we need stronger border security, he argued. Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 \nThe president preceded these tweets by condemning The New York Times for spreading more \"fake news\" in its coverage of the executive order. \nWhite House Counsel Kellyanne Conway also defended Trump's executive action on immigration as a necessary precaution to protect the country. She said it was a \" small price to pay \" for those few inconvenienced travelers. Conway also reminded the media that the the list of nations on the banned travel order came from the Obama administration .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T00:20:44.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
