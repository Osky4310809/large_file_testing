You don’t call a grown black man ‘boy.'”   \n“I don’t think she knows much about human decency,” Smith shot back. “She does not know Jeff Sessions. She’s never met Jeff Sessions.” \nRye fired back, “Because you are the one black guy that he hired on the committee doesn’t make him a civil rights leader, William! It actually really doesn’t. It makes, it makes, I am not going to. I am going to leave it at that,” she continued with anger in her voice, before cutting herself off. \n“You can leave it at that because you have nothing,” he replied. \nAs reported by Western Journalism , shortly after Trump nominated Sessions in November, Smith came to his former boss’ defense against Democrat changes of racism, stemming from the senator’s failure to be confirmed as a U.S. district court judge in the 1980’s.
