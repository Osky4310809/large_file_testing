She continued threatening to jump, but cops were able to grab her from behind, police said.\nIt was not immediately clear why the woman wanted to jump and her identity wasnâ€™t released, officials said. She was taken to an area hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:38:24.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
