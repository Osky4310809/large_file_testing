Lucy Ashley bullying who she thought was Natsu Dragion and Jet and Droy scolding Elfman , she arrives to tell them to stop. She is surprised by Natsu’s behavior towards her when he and Happy tearfully cry out her name and attempt to hug her before getting kicked by Lucy Ashley. [20] When Natsu begins to explain that he came from Earth Land to save their companions, Lisanna is seen hiding behind the bar and eventually running outside. Realizing that he’s the Natsu that she knows, Lisanna begins to cry. Not wanting to hurt Edolas’ Mirajane and Elfman, she makes the difficult decision and decides to stay in Edolas herself. [21] \nDuring the battle against the Royal Army, she is seen running out along with all the guild members and fights with a staff. [22] She cheers up Natsu Dragion during the battle. [23] However, when the Anima begins to take the living beings with Magic inside away, she begins to glow. Lisanna tries to explain, but Mirajane and Elfman of Edolas reveal that they already knew. Elfman said that they already noticed, but just couldn't say it, and apologize. Mirajane then says that she's like their Lisanna, someone who's really kind, and thus she can't let her real siblings cry anymore. As Lisanna tearfully screams out their names, Mirajane asks her to give them their regards. [24] The reunion with Natsu \nBack on Earth Land, Panther Lily finds and catches Lisanna for being a suspicious character. When everyone sees her, the whole group, especially Natsu, is surprised by her appearance. [25] She asks Panther Lily if he is an Exceed, to which he replies by stating his name, and Gajeel angrily asks her if she is picking a fight with his cat. She then notices Natsu, and immediately runs up to him, her hug tackling him down to the ground, in blushes and tears similar as to when he saw first saw her in Edolas. Lisanna decides to stay in Edolas \nShe then hugs Happy, and is glad to see Gray and Erza as well. She notices Lucy and Wendy too, and deduces they must be the Earth Land versions of their counterparts back in Edolas. Gray then asks if she's Lisanna of Earth Land, to which she replies affirmatively. Everyone is further shocked, and Happy and Natsu happily try to hug her, but Erza stops them, stating that Lisanna died two years ago. Lisanna then explains the truth to everyone about how an Anima absorbed her when Mirajane tried to heal her. Natsu asks why she didn't tell the truth when they first met, to which Lisanna says that she couldn't bear the weight of hurting her adopted siblings. [26] Lisanna reunited with her siblings \nAt Kardia Cathedral, Mirajane and Elfman are visiting Lisanna’s grave, two years since her apparent death. Suddenly, they are surprised to hear a voice they once knew call out to them. Turning around, their eyes widen at the sight of Lisanna running. All of them cry and hug each other for the first time in two years. [27] Tenrou Island arc Edit Mirajane, Elfman and Lisanna Sleep \nAfter the Edolas Incident, Lisanna returns to the guild and mentions numerous changes such as Mirajane ’s personality. [28] While everyone is talking about Edolas, she joins in and mentions how Natsu's counterpart is more sensitive, cries a lot from being picked on, and is really cute. This makes everyone laugh to the point that they would have liked to see a Natsu who was the exact opposite of their own. [29] After the regular guild parties and fights, she is seen sleeping with her siblings. [30] The alliance between Juvia and Lisanna is born \nA few days later, Lisanna and Wendy watch as the guild members take up numerous jobs. During that time, she and Wendy learn that Carla now has better control of her visions, she asks her if she can see who she will marry in the future whereupon Carla answers that she can't see too far into the future yet. [31] A day later, she watches the ceremony of the S-Class Mage Promotion Trial and is seen calling good luck to Elfman when he's chosen. [32] Lisanna beaten by Erza \nMoments after the ceremony, she is seen with Team Natsu and the others, commenting on how Natsu wants to become an S-Class Mage and find Igneel. [33] Lisanna then decides to become Juvia 's partner, due to the good relationship she has with Edolas Juvia . This makes Elfman angry as he thought she would be his. She then tells him that Evergreen has been watching him for a while and proposes that they team up. [34] We give up... \nAs the participants head towards the island, Lisanna is among the group barely standing the heat. [35] Shortly after, the master arrives to explain the rules of the first trial. When the first trial starts, she and Juvia are delayed due to Freed’s rune on the boat, preventing everyone from leaving for five minutes. As soon as the runes are released, she transforms into a fish and swims with Juvia to the island. [36] Lisanna and Juvia choose the ‘D’ route as they get to the island and encounter Erza as their opponent. However, despite a tedious fight, Erza overcomes both of them, eliminating her and Juvia from the trial. [37] Mirajane and Lisanna vs. Azuma \nLisanna and Juvia then meet up with Mirajane and Erza at a tent and hear of Mirajane's defeat at the hands of Elfman and Evergreen when they said they were getting married. While Mirajane thinks there is nothing going on between them, Lisanna still thinks that they go well together. When everyone remembers Freed and Bickslow heading back to the guild, they wonder about Mest and Wendy. Lisanna says that she had never met Mest in Edolas, so she doesn't know anything about him and asks if he joined in the last two years. However, nobody seems to notice or remember anything about him joining. [38] She and Mirajane later presumably see the warning signal that Erza launches to issue the warning of enemies. Grimoire Heart members then arrive, and Lisanna and Mirajane dispatch all of them in their immediate vicinity. [39] [40] Azuma then confronts the pair, and although Mirajane tells her to get back, Lisanna says she will fight. [41] Lisanna vs. Azuma \nAzuma begins using his Great Tree Arc Magic to attack Mirajane and Lisanna. [42] Lisanna is amazed at Azuma's incredible Magic Power, but says that she isn't going to hold back and uses Animal Soul: Harpy and tries to attack Azuma with the claws. Azuma grabs it effortlessly and Lisanna transforms into a giant penguin and tries to smash Azuma, but he evades it. Mirajane is surprised that her sister can change Take Overs instantly and asks herself since when she's been able to perform such a high level technique. Lisanna transforms by using Animal Soul: Rabbit and Azuma uses Bleve . From the smoke, Lisanna takes flight as a giant bird , and transforms into a cat in the sky. She falls to the ground and tries attacking Azuma with continuous scratches, which he evades and then counters with an explosion. [43] Lisanna trapped in a time bomb by Azuma \nImmediately, the pair gets wounded by an explosion. Lisanna tells her sister to change to her Satan Form. Azuma, recognizing Mirajane as the Demon Mirajane from this, requests a formal battle with her. Lisanna prepares to stay and fight but Mirajane tells her to get back. Because Mirajane doesn't properly respond to Azuma, Azuma traps Lisanna in a set of roots and places a 180-Second Time Bomb on the roots, saying that the only way for Lisanna to get out is if he is defeated. Mirajane then changes to her Demon Form and begins battling Azuma. Lisanna holds her injured sister \nHowever, she constantly checks back on the timer despite Lisanna telling her not to, thereby losing focus in the battle. After the timer hits 19, the heavily wounded Mirajane stops engaging Azuma and runs back to Lisanna, hugging her and telling her she won't let her die. The explosion then occurs, and after that, Lisanna finds Mirajane on top of her, unresponsive, and starts crying out her name. [44] She is then seen with Levy back at the camp as they tend to Mirajane and Gajeel. Lisanna and Levy vs Rustyrose \nAs Elfman comes with Evergreen, Lisanna says that it’s all her fault, but Levy tells her that they must combine their strength to defeat the enemy. [45] Lisanna is seen when Panther Lily arrives, telling Levy and her that Natsu and the others are on their way. Soon after, Rustyrose shows up and challenges her along with Panther Lily and Levy to battle. [46] She is later seen when she notices Bluenote's Magic. [47] When Freed and Bickslow arrive, she is both shocked and happy to see them and marvels at the true power of the Thunder God Tribe. [48] Lisanna shoots Freed towards Rustyrose \nLisanna, along with Panther Lily and Levy, warn Freed and Bickslow to be careful when Rustyrose attacks them with his spell, Ghost of the Britear. [49] She later collapses when Azuma uproots the tree on Tenrou Island that protects and gives power to Fairy Tail members. [50] After Erza defeats Azuma, the battle between Freed, Bickslow and Rustyrose resumes. Cornered, Rustyrose uses the same attack he used to defeat Evergreen and Elfman, the Tower of Dingir, and Lisanna, Levy and Panther Lily get caught in the attack too. However, Elfman frees them after he is possessed by Bickslow, hitting an unprepared Rustyrose from behind. Lisanna uses her Magic to transform her arms into wings and teams up with Freed, giving him, with her legs, a boost and the strength to quickly fly towards Rustyrose and give him the finishing blow, putting an end to the battle. [51] Lisanna feels guilty \nAfter the battle with Rustyrose, Natsu and the others arrive at the guild's camp when Lucy is shock to see many Fairy Tail members were injured. When Wendy decides to use her healing Magic, Lisanna stops her and says she must not trouble herself. Natsu is shocked and relieved to see Lisanna safe and he asks Lisanna what had happened. Lisanna tells Natsu that the camp was attack by Rustyrose and luckily Freed and Bickslow fought for them. Lisanna also says that they're all out of Magic Power and she is sad because Mirajane and the others are injured. As Lisanna is about to cry, Happy comments that a cheerful character like her must always smile, to which Lisanna agrees. [52] In order to end the war between Fairy Tail and Grimoire Heart , Natsu decides to go fight Hades , asking Lucy and Happy to accompany him. Although reluctant at first, Lucy agrees to his idea and the three are joined by Wendy , Carla and Panther Lily . Before leaving, Lisanna stops Lucy and tells her to stay close to Natsu, saying that he is stronger when he is surrounded by the people that he trusts. [53] \nNote: The following events occur only in the anime and do not constitute canon material. Click \"show\" to read the summary. Lisanna made Elfman blush \nIn their guild's camp, Freed and Levy are setting up their defensive runes while Lisanna treats Elfman 's wounds. Bickslow arrives and tells the group that he sent Rustyrose floating down the river, thinking that he may have an Organic Link Magic that may lead the enemy towards their location. Suddenly, Bickslow is attacked from behind by a Kan spell. [54] Lisanna vs. Kain \nThe attacker reveals himself to be Yomazu from Grimoire Heart , accompanied by Kawazu who then attacks the group with Heavy Egg Rain . Levy manages to block the attack with Solid Script: Guard . Yomazu then uses his knowledge about runes to dispel the ones surrounding the camp just as Kain Hikaru arrives and attacks Elfman with Shining Dodoskoi . He begins to battle Lisanna. Lisanna uses Animal Soul: Cat and begins to scratch Kain repeatedly. Lisanna almost gets hit by Elfman under Kain's control \nHowever, this was ineffectual, and Kain is able to push her away, shocking Lisanna with his endurance, revealing that he has a reserve Mr. Cursey , which he dubs \"Mr. Cursey #2.\" Kain then pulls out a strand of white hair and puts it on Mr. Cursey. He then turns its properties into that of iron and reveals that the strand of hair belongs to Elfman as he uses him to attack with Metallic Rocket Mr. #2 . Lisanna tries to dodge her brother but is hit and falls to the ground. [54] Lisanna, amazed at how Kain and Cana exchange attacks \nAs Kain grabs a weakened Lisanna by the leg, he is suddenly attacked by fire from behind. Lisanna discovers Cana to be the attacker who begins to insult Kain. Kain charges at her and Cana uses Summoned Lightning to stop him in his tracks. However, Kain manages to make himself lightning resistant, nullifying the attack. Cana then attacks with flaming cards but Kain jumps out of the line of fire by changing his properties into cotton. However, Cana is able to hit him with The Prayer's Fountain . Kain's cotton body begins to soak the water, causing him to fall to the ground. Cana then follows the attack with Icicle but Kain blocks her by changing his properties again. Watching the fight, Lisanna is at awe with Cana, realizing her power as one of the guild's S-Class candidates. [54] Lisanna accidentally attacks Elfman \nKain is then attacked by Solid Script: Iron from Levy who believes that she, Lisanna and Cana will be able to defeat the Dark Mage if they combine forces. Kain then begins to charge at them but Levy causes him to fall into a pitfall by using Solid Script: Hole . Cana attacks him with her cards and Lisanna sits on top of him while using Animal Soul: Penguin . However, the Fairy Tail Mages discover that Elfman was the one Lisanna attacked. The group then sees Kain charging towards them, his properties turned into mist, as he explains that he can change positions with Elfman, whose hair is still on Mr. Cursey. [54] Triple Unison Explosion \nHowever, as Kain approaches the group, he triggers a rune trap and is trapped. Levy explains that she and Freed anticipated that this would happen and had set up traps that will make the victim unable to use Magic. She then uses Solid Script: Storm as Cana throws the Death and Fire cards. Lisanna, having gained wings with Animal Soul: Wings , catches the two attacks and combines them together, attacking Kain with Triple Unison Explosion . The attacks explodes upon impact and Kain is sent flying. [54] Lisanna, Levy and Cana stunned at Elfman \nWhile Freed and Bickslow are battling the Dark Mages , Levy, Lisanna and Cana try to free Elfman who was half-buried in the ground. Once Elfman is freed, the three girls debate on whether to join in the fight, noting that they're out of Magic. Elfman then wakes up and goes to eat Kawazu's Egg Wall and subsequently joins the fight. [55] Lisanna and the others came to help \nAfter Grimoire Heart is defeated, Lisanna, with the rest of Fairy Tail, scares off the Grimoire Heart members who were about to attack Happy and Carla . After they flee, the guild celebrates their victory and returns to camp. [56] At camp, she plays with Natsu's hair who has passed out from the side effect of eating lightning. [55] Later on, Lisanna is being playfully teased by Laxus Dreyar , stretching her cheeks, wondering if she was really Lisanna. [57] Lisanna holding hands with other Fairy Tail members \nEverything is interrupted when the \"Black Dragon of the Apocalypse,\" Acnologia lands on the island and starts its rampage. Lisanna flees with the guild after Makarov defends the guild from the Dragon by himself. [58] Lisanna shortly returns with the guild to help Makarov, though. Eventually, the Dragon flies into the air, tired of the battle, and prepares a final attack to destroy the island. All the Fairy Tail members on the island hold hands in an attempt to negate the attack by using defensive Magic. It fails as Acnologia fires its Dragon Breath, completely destroying Tenrou Island. [59] X791 arc Edit The Lost Fairies Return \nLisanna, along with the others, is found alive and returns to the Fairy Tail Guild after being found by Bisca, Alzack, Jet, Droy, Max, Warren and the Trimens from Blue Pegasus . She watches as Mavis Vermilion reveals that she was the one who saved them and then disappears. She, along with the other returning members, is welcomed back by Romeo . [60] When the guild celebrates the return of their missing members, Lisanna asks Alzack and Bisca if they have any children. They reveal that they have one daughter named Asuka. [61] Key of the Starry Sky arc \nNote: Events in this arc occur only in the anime and do not constitute canon material. Click \"show\" to read the arc plot. Lisanna and the Fairy Tail members dancing \nWhen Natsu and Lucy practice their dance skills in preparation for a dance ball, Erza appears and tries to teach Natsu how to dance properly, spinning him out of control. When Natsu asks her to stop, Lisanna approaches him and tells him that she will show him how to dance if he doesn't want to learn from Erza. However, Lisanna's method of teaching turns out to be exactly the same as Erza's, and she spins him like a top, with Natsu pleading for her to release him. [62] \nLater, Lisanna, Natsu, Happy, Mirajane, and Elfman wonder what to do with Lisanna's grave at the church, since she is alive. Happy mentions that he and Natsu were the ones who made it, causing Natsu to blush. Mirajane suggests keeping it as a memento but changing the inscription. The group then discusses the priest from the Magnolia church and his pilgrimage. After that, Lisanna and the others watch as Michelle arrives at the guild and explains to them why she came. [63] Lisanna and her siblings notice that Gajeel has run away \nA little while after Michelle's arrival, at the guild, Lisanna, Mirajane, Macao, Wakaba, Elfman, Romeo and Kinana are discussing Laxus and his upcoming duel with Natsu. Elfman suddenly suggests that they hold a festival in honor of the showdown and they all agree on it. She later watches along with the rest of the guild as Natsu is quickly beaten by Laxus. [64] Take Over siblings trapped inside the slime \nThat afternoon, Sugarboy , Mary Hughes and Coco invade Fairy Tail, Lisanna, Mirajane, and Elfman are attacked by Sugarboy’s Dog Whistle Magic , which traps the three and absorbs their Magic Power, leaving the siblings too weak to even stand. However, they are quickly able to regain their strength and Lisanna joins her siblings in fighting against Coco. When the battle is over, Jet and Droy return after looking for Gajeel. Lisanna says that just three people are able to make them look so weak. [65] \nWhen they find out that they were after Lucy's memento, they find out that the memento is a part of a clock. Fairy Tail then splits into groups to find the pieces of the clock. Afterwards, the three siblings go on a picnic. While Elfman is cooking “man stew”, Lisanna asks Mirajane if is it okay to eat above a dangerous cliff, to which Mirajane simply replies with a smile. [66] Take Over Animal Soul: Mermaid \nLater, Lisanna is looking for the clock part underwater and finds a huge plug. She opens it and the lake's water transfers to the next lake. Elfman and Mira watch as the water moves and conclude that it must be Lisanna’s work. While going to Lisanna, they find the missing clock part. After a short conversation (which includes Lisanna breaking the fourth wall by saying she wanted to \"appeal to the people\"), Elfman goes over and pulls out the clock piece. Without any control over himself, he throws it; Lisanna asks why he threw it. Mary Hughes then steps out to take the clock piece and they see her and guess that she was following them. Elfman fights to get the clock part back, but Hughes controls and forces him to hit Mira and Lisanna, but they dodge it. [67] Lisanna grabbed by Satan Soul \nLisanna, Elfman and Mirajane then engage in battle with Mary Hughes. Mary takes Mirajane's Satan Soul and attacks the siblings with it; Lisanna and Elfman both try to fight back but are defeated by the powerful Demon. Lisanna, along with Elfman and Mirajane, is about to be finished by Mary when Mirajane stops the attack. Mirajane uses Satan Soul: Halphas to defeat Mary, while Lisanna and Elfman watch in shock and fear. Lisanna and the others then obtain the clock piece. [68] The clock part starts glowing. \nThe three siblings then make their way home with the clock piece in hand. However, while walking back, the aforementioned piece emits a glow. Following this, Lisanna, Mirajane and Elfman head for a desert-like area and later arrive at the ruins along with their other guild mates. Lisanna's and the others' clock pieces start to glow and come together and, upon combining, they form the Infinity Clock. Just then the Reborn Oración Seis appears under the clock, much to the shock of everybody.

[73] The guild later on decides to join the Grand Magic Games . Lisanna, together with her team mates, Mirajane, Elfman, and Cana, hikes out to the mountains to train themselves and enhance their power. [74] After training, Lisanna and Elfman arrive at Crocus , where the Grand Magic Games are being held.

[79] Later, Lisanna and the other Fairy Tail members are surprised to see Mavis at the Grand Magic Games. [80] When Fairy Tail's second team, Team Fairy Tail B , enters Fairy Tail cheers again, though Mavis notices the man disguised as Mystogan is Jellal Fernandes , but accepts Makarov's decision to let him participate. [81] Lisanna and the others surprised to see Mavis \nDuring the first event of the Games, Hidden , which Gray takes part in, Lisanna stares on in awe when Rufus of Team Sabertooth suddenly reveals himself to every one of his opponents. [82] When the Mage then uses Memory-Make to hit all his opponents, Lisanna is amazed. The event then ends with both of Fairy Tail's teams in the bottom of the ranking. [83] \nDuring Lucy's fight against Flare Corona , she, alongside her guildmates, cheers for Lucy, and are unaware that Flare has Asuka as hostage to make Lucy lose. [84] Everyone is surprised when Natsu unveils Flare's attempt, but even with the exposure of it, Lucy still loses. [85] After Lucy's loss, Lisanna and the other Fairy Tail member watch Jellal fight with Jura Neekis . When Jellal loses to Jura, Lisanna and the other Fairy Tail members are in shock over it. [86] Lisanna inside the Bar Sun \nLater, Lisanna, along with the rest of the Fairy Tail Guild, heads to a local bar to celebrate Fairy Tail's terrible loss. [87] The next day, Lisanna is left dumbfounded as she watches Natsu and Gajeel participate in Chariot , as both Dragon Slayers suffer from severe motion sickness, leaving them to lag behind in the last three places alongside Sting of Sabertooth. [88] During the second day's second match, when Elfman is called to battle Bacchus , Lisanna is shocked and tells Macao and Wakaba, who openly expressed their disappointment, not to be mean. When Bacchus makes a perverted comment about her and Mirajane to Elfman, she is visibly disgusted. [89] Lisanna spying on Raven Tail \nAs the battle commences, she is visibly worried about Elfman, as he continues to take lots of damage, but is encouraged by Evergreen . During Elfman's last ditch strategy against his opponents attack, she is close to tears, and she is extremely relieved when her brother wins. [90] She is later seen alongside her brother in the clinic, and walks with the rest of Team Fairy Tail A and Carla back to the arena, where she realizes her older sister started her battle . She is embarrassed at Jenny Realight 's wager and celebrates with the rest of Fairy Tail when her elder sister wins. [91] \nOn the third day of the Games, Lisanna watches alongside the rest of the guild as the Pandemonium event begins, and cheers for Erza and Cana, Fairy Tail's two competitors. [92] When Erza manages to dominate the event by herself, solely taking out every opponent, Lisanna screams and cheers with the crowd, happy at their victory. [93] This only continues when Cana later destroys the Magic Power Finder in the secondary event, consequently landing Fairy Tail the two top spots for the event section of the day. [94] After that, Lisanna team up with The Raijinshuu, spying on the members of Raven Tail to make sure they don't get up to anything during the battles. [95] After the weeding out of Ivan's illusion, involving a depiction of him defeating Laxus single-handedly, Lisanna is shocked to see that all of the Team Raven Tail members were defeated by Laxus alone. [96] \nAfter Laxus' triumph, the Grand Magic Games resume with Wendy fighting Team Lamia Scale 's Sky God Slayer, Sherria Blendy . At some point during the battle, when Wendy avoids Sherria's Heavenly Gathering of Clouds , Lisanna is seen amazed and startled with Wendy's ingenious strategy; she had healed her opponent's physical strength and as a result, the attack had overshot, missing Wendy. [97] At the end of the day, Lisanna and her fellow guildmates party at the local bar. While there, she sighs in disbelief at how Elfman's injuries still haven't recovered, and later plays \"Barrel Surfing\" with Natsu and Happy . [98] Lisanna amongst the unconscious \nThat evening, Lisanna and the others in the guild head to Ryuzetsu Land, a popular resort in Crocus. Upon arriving, Lisanna asks Erza if her injuries have healed, which is met by Mirajane reminding her it's Erza they're talking about. [99] After exploring the area, Lisanna states that they should've brought Elfman along, unaware that he arrived with Evergreen before she did. [100] Afterwards, Lisanna watches in surprise as Jenny Realight steals Mirajane's bikini top as revenge for being humiliated in their match the previous day. [101] However, the three later sit down at a table and have a normal conversation. [102] A while later, Gray and Lyon fight and freeze the pool, with Natsu deciding to get rid of the ice by using his own Magic. Lisanna is sent flying when Natsu employs more power than necessary and ends up in the rubble next to an unconscious Mirajane. [103] \nOn the fourth day of the Grand Magic Games, Lisanna stands and smiles alongside the rest of Fairy Tail as she watches the new Team Fairy Tail steps out to fight. [104] \nLater, the tag battle between Team Quatro Puppy and Team Blue Pegasus involving Bacchus and Rocker versus Ichiya and the mysterious Rabbit starts. Lisanna is seen in the audience bewildered to see that the identity of the Rabbit is the exceed, Nichiya . [105] Lisanna watches the fight \nAs Natsu and Gajeel from the newly formed team enter the arena to battle Sabertooth 's Sting and Rogue , Lisanna, alongside her Guildmates, watches the match confident of their win. [106] The fierce battle between the Dragon Slayers takes place with both sides intensely fighting for the win. When Sting spells his Holy Nova , Lisanna gets shocked by the explosion caused in the impact. [107] Lisanna and Mirajane anxiously watch as Sting wants to battle Natsu and Gajeel alone. [108] \nSoon both Natsu and Gajeel seemingly fall to Sting and Rogue , but miraculously stand up. Lisanna watches in amazement as Natsu takes on the Twin Dragons alone, waiting to see who will emerge the victor. [109] At the end of the match, Lisanna joyfully witnesses Natsu defeat Sting and Rogue alone, leaving Fairy Tail in the ranking's first place at the end of the fourth day. [110] Lisanna worried about Team Fairy Tail's actions \nWhen the final day of the games gets under way, Team Fairy Tail enters the arena while Lisanna stands in the crowd with the rest of Fairy Tail, cheering for the team representing their guild. [111] However, a confused Lisanna soon starts wondering why Team Fairy Tail has not moved at all, since the beginning of the event. [112] After the team begins battling under Mavis' strategy, Lisanna refers to it as the Fairy Star Strategy . [113] While watching Gray battle Rufus Lore of Team Sabertooth , Lisanna notes how the latter can seemingly make any Magic he likes with his power. [114] After Gray manages to defeat Rufus, Lisanna, along with the other guild members, cheers on the Ice Mage for his victory. [115] Later, Lisanna wonders if Natsu and the others are fine, to which Makarov replies that they can only trust them and wait. [116] Then, Lisanna is shocked when Mavis' prediction is wrong and Erza begins fighting with Kagura instead of Minerva. [117] However, Minerva does make an appearance, and seeing the three powerful Mages begin to face off in a three-way fight, Lisanna comments on the unpredictable nature of the battle. [118] \nLater on, Lisanna watches in anxiety as Erza battle Kagura alone, with the latter drawing her Archenemy and causing blood to spill. [119] Soon after, Lisanna watches in awe with the rest of her guild mates as Kagura draws Archenemy to strike Erza. [120] Despite Erza being okay and managing to fight back after the attack, Lisanna ends up observing another tense situation when, in another part of Crocus, Rogue confronts Gajeel and begins to beat the Iron Dragon Slayer around after being possessed by his own shadow. [121] Soon after, she also witnesses Orga of Sabertooth being defeated in a single blow by Jura of the Ten Wizard Saints, something which greatly shocks her. [122] Lisanna happy over Fairy Tail's victory \nDespite his strength, Jura ends up falling in his battle against Laxus, as do all of the other opponents who come up against Fairy Tail. Eventually, only Sting remains, and, knowing this, the Sabertooth Mage calls all of Team Fairy Tail to his location. Upon their arrival, Sting threatens to take them all out, and Lisanna watches in tension as he moves to attack them. However, Sting, seeing Fairy Tail's determination, ends up surrendering, allowing Fairy Tail to win the Grand Magic Games. Hearing of their victory, Lisanna happily hugs Levy, her eyes filled with tears. [123] [124] \nLisanna, along with the members of many other guilds, is summoned by the King , and is told of the impending invasion at the hands of the Dragons. When Evergreen states that they couldn't even defeat Acnologia at Tenrou Island, Lisanna remarks that Acnologia was a special case. [125] Upon the King's request that the guilds join forces to stop the Dragons, Lisanna joins in on the raucous declaration of acceptance. [126] As she stands in Crocus with the other members of her guild, a huge roar suddenly echoes throughout the town, and Lisanna watches in shock as a giant tremor hits the city, smashing a nearby building and sending debris flying. [127] With the Dragons attacking Corcus, Atlas Flame lands in front of Lisanna and the rest of the Fairy Tail Mages. Atlas then releases a massive breath attack, scattering the Mages with ease. [128] \nLisanna is shielded from the mighty Dragon's blast by Elfman, and when the dust resulting from Atlas Flame's Dragon's Roar subsides, both she, and her brother, are revealed to be relatively unharmed. [129] Shortly thereafter, as Motherglare , the Dragon circling Crocus from above, sends a multitude of eggs raining down on the streets below, Lisanna looks up into the sky and wonders exactly what they are. [130] After the demolition of the Eclipse Gates, the Dragons and Hatchlings go on to vanish from the current timeline, leading Lisanna and the rest of her Guild to celebrate in their victory. [131] Lisanna and the other girls arrive at the Great Banquet \nA few days after the Dragons disappear, Lisanna, Mirajane, Wendy, Lucy and Yukino get ready for a large banquet at the Royal Palace; while her sister tries to rid Yukino of her embarrassment regarding her appearance in her dress, Lisanna, having trouble tying her corset, pleads for Mirajane to come and help her. [132] A short while later, Lisanna and the other girls, fully dressed in elegant gowns, arrive at the Royal Palace, with Lisanna in particular marveling at the inside of the illustrious dining hall. She then sits next to her brother and glares at him as he voraciously devours a large quantity of food. [133] Later on during the banquet, when Sting and a very drunk Kagura fight over which guild Yukino should join, Fairy Tail joins the debate, asking Yukino to join their guild instead. During this, Lisanna dejectedly points out that she and Yukino are nearly identical in character. [134] \nAfter returning to Magnolia, Lisanna rides into town on a cheering Elfman's back, telling her brother to stop. [135] As Natsu holds up their trophy, Lisanna jumps for joy with the other members of the guild.

[137] Sun Village arc Edit Lisanna and Mirajane in the bathhouse \nLisanna, along with all the other girls, takes a bath in the new bath house and marvels at its size and appearance. [138] Washing her body, Lisanna also remarks that since they won the Grand Magic Games, the job requests have started pouring in, and then expresses her surprise at hearing Lucy state that Natsu and Gray went on a job together. [139] She then, however, expresses her doubt at hearing that Erza is away on a job with Wendy, noticing that another scarlet-haired woman has been in the bathhouse with them the entire time. [140] Lisanna then expresses her shock at hearing Lucy invite Flare to join Fairy Tail. [141] Tartaros arc Edit \nAs Elfman stares down Warren Rocko for making googly eyes at Lisanna, Lisanna tells him to stop. [142] Later, when the fatally injured Laxus, Yajima and Thunder God Tribe are brought back to the guild, Lisanna watches as Makarov lies to Freed about the lost lives of those caught in Nine Demon Gates member Tempester 's Magical Barrier Particles. [143] Later, after Fairy Tail discusses the possibility of searching out former Magic Council members due to their status as Tartaros' targets, Lisanna listens to Makarov as he gives a speech declaring that Fairy Tail will eliminate their enemies . [144] Lisanna being choked by Elfman \nLisanna and Elfman head out to the home of ex-Council member Yuri , but arrive to find the man already dead. As Elfman examines the body and ponders how he was killed if he has no wounds, Lisanna goes to prepare a Lacrima so that they can contact the guild. Pulling the crystal from her bag, Lisanna is shocked when Yuri suddenly opens his eyes, jerks upright and points to the Lacrima, smashing it in her hands from across the room. Watching Yuri fall back to the ground lifeless once more, Lisanna and Elfman question what happened, only to be interrupted by Seilah of the Nine Demon Gates , who has been sitting watching them the entire time. The Tartaros woman stands and begins to move towards them, prompting Elfman to tell Lisanna to be careful; however, for some reason, he suddenly reaches out and grabs Lisanna by the neck, strangling her. Lisanna flails and tries to free herself from his tight grip, but Elfman seems incapable of moving his own body. Scared himself, Elfman yells for Seilah to stop whatever she is doing, though the woman refuses to cease her actions. [145] As a result of Elfman's tight grip around her neck, Lisanna eventually loses consciousness. [146] Lisanna imprisoned with Natsu \nSome time later, she is brought to Tartaros' headquarters . Stripped of her clothes, she is placed in a jail cell where she later awakens to find Natsu alongside her. With both of them having been stripped of their clothing, Lisanna expresses her deep embarrassment over her current state and is even more shocked upon hearing that Erza and Mirajane have been captured as well. Believing that Elfman has likely been captured as well, Lisanna grows gloomy over their state of affairs, noting Tartaros to be unlike anyone they've faced before. However, Natsu reassures her that everything will be alright, bringing a smile to her face until she tells him to stop looking at her. Despite her struggles, she is unable to break out of the Magic-sealing cuffs which have been placed on her and wonders what to do. [147] Lisanna tries to get Natsu's cuffs off of him with her legs, only to fail, claiming that an ordinary human cannot remove them. When Natsu turns to try and take off hers, she yells at him for turning around when she told him not to, much to her embarrassment. At this point, Silver arrives and throws Lisanna a blanket, which Lisanna thanks the older man for. She then looks at Natsu, who states that Silver smells just like Gray. [148] Lisanna and Natsu fall as the Cube shakes \nShortly after, Lisanna notices the heavy shaking of her surroundings and grows frightened. Though asked if she is alright, Lisanna does not respond, instead focusing her thoughts on her elder brother and sister. [149] As the tremor continues, Lisanna notices something and tries to point it out, however, Natsu takes a look at Lisanna's almost-naked body, much to her annoyance. As he finally notices the sword outside of their cell, Lisanna notes that they can use it to break the chains on their cuffs. [150] Lisanna and Natsu free themselves using the heat sword, and rush to save Erza from her captivity. After this, the two await for Kyôka and ambush her when she walks into Erza's cell by catching her arms, with Lisanna activating her Animal Soul: Cat. [151] Lisanna is ambushed by Lamy \nTaking the Demon by surprise, the group hastily chain her up, with Lisanna demanding to know Mirajane and Elfman's locations. Stating she doesn't know who Elfman is, Kyôka does tell the group where they can find Mirajane, and Lisanna and Natsu decide to go and look for her, leaving Erza to deal with Kyôka. [152] As they head towards the area specified, Lisanna and Natsu are spotted by some Tartaros troops, who move to engage them. Though preparing to fight, Lisanna is told to go on ahead. [153] \nContinuing her search, Lisanna eventually comes across Mirajane and happily hugs her out of worry. Asked why she is using Animal Soul, Lisanna reveals that she didn't have any clothes. Stating that she, Natsu, Erza and Elfman were captured, she explains that only Elfman is left but is soon corrected by Seilah, who states that he was not captured. Remembering her, Lisanna warns Mirajane that she can control people, who then tells her to stand back. Seilah reveals that though he blew up the building as he was ordered, nobody died and she was embarrassed as a result. Hearing this, Lisanna breathes a sign of relief. [154] Lisanna then watches as Mirajane and Seilah engage in combat and is shocked to see that even in her Satan Soul form, Mirajane is getting overwhelmed by the Demon. [155] Later, she is abruptly ambushed from behind by Lamy , who claims that she will be her opponent. [156] Lamy's fight with Lisanna is interrupted. \nShowing concern for her sister, Lisanna knocks Lamy against a nearby wall and throws the Demon off of her back, recognizing Seilah's Macro as the ability that was used to control Elfman. Continuing to fight with Lamy, Lisanna questions Lamy over who the Underworld King is, and is then left in amazement when Mirajane destroys Hell's Core. Claiming that Mirajane's Satan Soul: Sitri is the ultimate Demon, Lisanna is scoffed at by Lamy who warns her not to underestimate the Nine Demon Gates . Their separate battle is then interrupted as Seilah overpowers Mirajane, blowing them all away with her unleashed strength. [157] \nLying on the ground after Seilah's devastating attack, Lisanna wonders whether the Demon can't control herself anymore. Watching as Mirajane gets repeatedly attacked, Lisanna yells out her sister's name, but before she can do anything, she is gotten hold of Lamy one more time. Seilah continues attacking and Lisanna, unable to move, tells Mirajane to run and continues struggling just as Seilah seemingly readies for the final attack. She is delighted to see Elfman's arrival as, summoned by Mirajane through Macro , he delivers a devastating blow to Seilah, taking her down. [158] Lisanna and her friends report that they are okay \nLater, Lisanna is able to return to the surface with her two siblings, meeting up with Warren 's group. [159] Thanks to Warren, the guild is able to make telepathic communication, but during their conversation Lisanna is the first to notice Mard Geer 's interference with the mental link as she shows concern for Warren before he falls to his knees. [160] Hearing the Underworld King's threat to their lives, Lisanna is then pulled into the surface of the mobile island. Elfman tells them to stick together, leading the three siblings to hug tightly as they as all quickly petrified in the stone; [161] Lisanna, and everyone else, is later released from the stone by the Celestial Spirit King . [162] Subsequently, Lisanna engages in combat with Lamy, who is able to multiply herself, in order to provide Mirajane with enough time to follow after Seilah. [163] Lisanna and the others reunite with Lucy \nLisanna later witnesses the return of Acnologia, frightened upon the Dragon's destructive actions on the land; [164] however, her group is distracted when the duplicate Lamys attack. Fighting them back with Elfman, Jet and Droy, Lisanna and her friends defeat the clones as Lucy arrives at their location. The blond is happy to see Lisanna safe and explains to the group what happened to her and the others she was with, with the everyone becoming relieved when they hear that Igneel arrived to help them. However, their happiness is short-lived when Wendy arrives with Doranbolt to remind them of the countless Face bombs waiting to go off. [165] Now disheartened, Lisanna and her friends stand feeling defeated until they are telepathically contacted by Makarov, who tells them not to fret, as Fairy Tail has it's own trump card: Lumen Histoire , the frozen body of Mavis Vermilion . [166] Lisanna comforts Elfman after the guild's destruction \nStanding next to Lucy, Lisanna is shocked upon Makarov requesting that they return to the guild's basement. Albeit, she listens to Elfman as he announces that he will stay behind, expressing his sense of unease. [167] As she and her friends make their way towards the guild, Lucy collapses beside her and Lisanna's Take-Over suddenly wears off. [168] The group then realise that Face has activated, and that the world's Ethernano is beginning to vanish; however, before the Face bombs can completely wipe Magic from the continent, the Dragon Slayers' Dragon parents arrive, flying through all of the Faces and destroying them as Lisanna smiles in joy. [169] Eventually, the returning Dragons regroup near the befuddled Mages, Lisanna standing next to the others as the Dragons commend them for their efforts and reveal that their time on Earth Land will soon come to an end. [170] She later watches as the Dragons ascend into the skies and bid farewell, claiming that they will always watch over the humans. [171] A week later, as Elfman mopes about causing the destruction of the guild, Lisanna tells him that its not his fault.

[174] When she reveals to Natsu that Elfman was doing his own training separately for the past year and the two men begin to brawl, she stands to the side cheering them on. [175] \nA little later, after Gajeel forms his \"B-Team,\" Lisanna tags along. They go in search of the other members, and the group soon arrives at Laxus' believed location. When Gajeel tells the group of their infiltration mission's dismal success rate, Lisanna is astounded. Levy then arrives, stating that they need separate teams to raise their chance of success, before asking how they could leave her behind. [176] Later, they all head to the Pegasus Village hot springs to relax; where they meet up with Ichiya , who tells them that Laxus and the Thunder God Tribe have joined Blue Pegasus , something which shocks Lisanna. When Gajeel is knocked over to the women's side of the hot springs, Lisanna is visibly embarrassed. [177] Lisanna part of the reunion \nLisanna and the B-team borrow Blue Pegasus' Christina to head to the Alvarez Empire [178] and arrive at the scene of Team Natsu and the others just in time, as Laxus prevents Ajeel 's Sands of Death from hitting the Fairy Tail Mages. When Elfman expresses through the speakers of Christina that he wants to talk too, Lisanna replies that he should stop it. As Laxus engulfs Ajeel in a lightning blast, Mest teleports their group inside the airship and they all proceed to leave. Inside the airship, as a reply to Gray's question why they are all here, Lisanna states that their group has done work on their own, in order to save their master. Lisanna, along with her fellow Mages, then look happily at their rescued master as he tears up over realizing what a great family he has. [179] \nOnce Makarov is back at the guild, Lisanna can't help but laugh when Makarov says that he will be Master until he dies, taking the role of the 8th after Erza. [180] When Erza asks for some star mangoes and Elfman wonders if they taste manly, Lisanna expresses that she hopes they don't. [181] Lisanna then confidently smiles when Natsu says that they must defeat Alvarez if they want to survive and still be together as a guild. [182] As they all prepare for the unavoidable battle, when Mira reveals that she has been training and getting stronger this last year, shocking Macao and Wakaba , Lisanna confirms this, saying that she also is much stronger. Suddenly, they are interrupted by Mavis, who intends to reveal to Lisanna and the other Mages the secrets of Fairy Heart , The One Magic as well as her relationship with Zeref . [183] After learning of the true nature of Fairy Heart, Lisanna stands in awe of the revelation with other members of the guild. Elfman questions about Alvarez attacking in order to get Fairy Heart and Lisanna asks what for. [184] As Alvarez commences their attack, Lisanna and Mirajane take note of their arrival. [185] Lisanna explains Mirajane's reasons for taking over Seilah \nLater, sensing that Alvarez has broken through Freed's Jutsu Shiki barrier, Lisanna and her siblings run to the source of the infiltration. [186] Arriving at the infiltration, Lisanna knocks away a few of the enemies before Mira reveals her Satan Soul: Mirajane Seilah and Lisanna explains to Juvia and Gray that Seilah would have died had Mira not taken her over. After Mira puts most of the enemies to sleep, Lisanna notifies her that some are still awake, causing Mira to say that they will have to be dealt with the old fashioned way. [187] Shortly after, Erza manages to deal a devastating blow on Ajeel , whereafter the latter envelops the entire Magnolia in a sandstorm , capturing Lisanna, who ends up being hugged by a dramatic Juvia. [188] The calamity is soon ended, though, as Bisca manages to locate Erza and save her from Ajeel's grip, allowing her to use and attack with Nakagami Starlight. [189] \nAs the sandstorm dissipates, Lisanna and the others notice five mechanical beings standing before them. Lisanna tries to attack one, but due to her opponent's brute strength, her efforts prove ineffective. Her comrades face similar trouble as they one by one realize that their foe is specifically designed to exploit their weaknesses. As Lisanna and the others wonder how this is possible, Wall Eehto explains that exploiting his opponent's weaknesses is the ability of his Magic, Weakness . [190] However, Lisanna and the others determine that to defeat the robots all they have to do is switch opponents, so Lisanna takes on Elfman's speedy robot and easily defeats it. [191] But her satisfaction over their victory is converted into concern regarding the Thunder God's Tribe safety as Kardia Cathedral is engulfed in an explosion. [192] Lisanna prepares for battle \nIn the conference after their victory against the Empire's vanguard, Lisanna is ordered to help Sabertooth and Blue Pegasus hold back the enemy forces situated to the north of Magnolia. [193] She then decides to follow Mavis' lead in not changing their plan despite Natsu's spontaneous act of trying to take on Zeref with only Happy to help him. [194] She later accompanies her group north, and sleeps with her siblings when night falls. [195] They reach the battlefield the next day and prepare to face the Empire's army, but are horrified to see that their enemies have utterly crushed their allies, with Lisanna outraged to see them holding high the unconscious bodies of Jenny and the others as a sign of victory. [196] She immediately helps her guildmates rescue their fallen allies, and, even as the climate of the whole region changes, Lisanna prepares to face the full brunt of the Empire's northern army [197] and fights alongside her siblings, [198] but they halt upon noticing a brilliant light shining down on them. [199] Lisanna hears Zera \nWhen the light recedes, Lisanna discovers that she and Mirajane have been relocated to an unknown beach, with their guildmates who are supposed to be back in Magnolia also present there. However, the approach of a massive army gives them no time to ponder upon the circumstances. [200] In the midst of the ensuing battle, all Fairy Tail Mages are telepathically contacted by a mysterious entity. Lisanna belligerently demands the telepath's identity, only to be told to head for the Guild to protect their beloved First Master. [201] When Mirajane begins to fret about their brother, whom they have been separated from, Lisanna hopes that Elfman also received the communiqué, before heading north with the rest of her allies while her sister handles the Irene Squad , [202] but returns to her sister's side only to find her alone and injured. Upon regaining consciousness, Mirajane immediately emphasizes their need to return to the Guild due to the imminent gathering of the Spriggan 12. [203] \nLisanna later joins the battle to retake control of their guild, just in time to save Elfman from Ajeel's Ant Lion Pit ; [204] the siblings then unite to defeat the Shield of Spriggan. [205] However, they are easily overwhelmed, but regardless, Elfman swears to protect both Lisanna and the guild at any cost.
