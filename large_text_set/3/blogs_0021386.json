Here's what's new on the Store. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus see red \nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus now come in a shade of fetching red. They join the existing family of (PRODUCT)RED products that are specially created to raise funds for fighting HIV/AIDS. \nThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition come in the flavours of 128GB and 256GB. They start from S$1218 and will be available in Singapore come Friday, 24 March. \nWant to do your part but don’t particularly like red? There are silicone and leather cases in new colours: azure, camellia and pebble, taupe, sapphire and berry. These start from S$48. iPhone SE doubles up on storage The littlest iPhone comes with more storage than ever. Gone are the 16GB and 64GB variants. Say hello to the new 32GB and 128GB ones. You’ll be glad to know there’s no price increment; they start from S$658 and will be available Friday, 24 March. iPads get streamlined The iPad Air 2 is no more. The latest iPad in town is known as...the iPad. It gets an A9 chip bump and a price cut. The 32GB Wi-Fi model will set you back S$498 while the 32GB Wi-Fi and Cellular model will cost you S$698. The iPad Mini 4 hasn’t been neglected either. Storage has been bumped up to 128GB which is also the only option available now. It will cost S$718 for the Wi-Fi model and S$898 for the Wi-Fi and Cellular model.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:42:10.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
