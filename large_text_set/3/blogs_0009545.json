Wenger is sensitive to ­supporters’ ­frustration and if the run-in goes badly he will leave. \nKeswick said: “We’re fully aware of the attention ­currently focused on the club and understand the debate. \n“We respect that fans are entitled to their different ­individual opinions but we will always run this great ­football club with its best long-term ­interests at heart.

Any decisions will be made by us mutually and communicated at the right time in the right way.” \nIt is understood Thursday's ­statement was designed to take the heat off Wenger ahead of the business end of the season, which starts with Saturday's home FA Cup quarter-final against non-League giant-killers Lincoln. \nAnother upset there against the Imps, who have already taken four league scalps in their run to the last eight, including away to Premier League Burnley, would really raise the pressure. But it seems increasingly likely Wenger will sign a new deal.

French champions Paris Saint-­Germain are in pole-position to sign forward Sanchez. \nThe Gunners' top brass want to believe Wenger can reinvent himself and build a new squad to bring back success.

What keeps me going is the love for the game, the passion for football, the ­passion for the club, the love of the uncertainly.

After, how will I be judged? It’s not too much my problem. \n“I think I’ve shown first of all I love this club, I’m loyal to this club and I make the right decisions for this club. I’ll ­continue to do that, while ­respecting the values I think are vital for me. If I can’t do that, I will not be here.” \nOf fans’ opinion influencing his decision, he added: “It won’t be the most important factor but of course, you ­consider it.” poll loading Should Arsene Wenger go at the end of the season? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:53:29.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
