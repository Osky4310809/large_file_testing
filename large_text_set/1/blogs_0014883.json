What's New in Version 17.3.6725.0105 \n• Fixed a critical issue that caused the app to stop working on macOS 10.9For users having issue with the latest update, please contact support and include \"MacSync\" in the comment.You can contact support via this link https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=717093 Screenshots Easy Set-up, Easy to use by Crimson3one I am not sure where all the bad press is coming from, but it sounds like it’s users on macOS 10.9 which they have fixed a bug on. It took me less than 5 minutes to get this working for a Business 365 account and now all my documents reside there and I can easily access them from my ipad or iPhone while on the go. The only thing is to make sure you turn it on if you dont have it set to auto-start or some documents wont show up until you sync them. I sometimes forget when i restart my computer. Other than that, it works great! It’s broken by bigsky1970 I’ve used OneDrive when it was called Skydrive, so I’ve used it almost since Microsoft introduced their cloud service. At that time I was using a desktop PC, but now I have a mixture of PC and Macs. Unfortunately, I should have read the reviews before I installed the update because OneDrive was working flawlessly over the last several updates for me, but now it’s broken. The new version after the update wouldn’t even start. Since it won’t run, I’ve simply uninstalled it from my system. One Drive vs Box by AZTechUser I use multiple cloud sharing apps / companies and prefer OneDrive over Box because it allows both a business and personal account and also lets me customize my sync’d folders by computer. Box requires you to either sync to all or no PC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:44:02.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
