According to The Daily Mail, she filmed her crying infant in mid-meltdown, capturing the moment the baby calmed down upon hearing Sheeran’s silky smooth vocals.\n@edsheeran @LivEchonews @joannenye15 Our baby loves Ed Sheeran! Perfect for calming her down! Shame she cant come to see him on #dividetour pic.twitter.com/S9hGvnphGM \n— Gareth Nye (@ganye91) March 21, 2017 Gracie’s father Gareth explained that his daughter was born with hip dysplasia, which requires her to wear a Pavlik harness 24 hours in day to ensure that the impacted area remains immobilized.\n“She is being treated at Alder Hey who are fantastic, but sometimes she gets really frustrated,” Gareth told Liverpool’s Echo News . “But listening to Ed Sheeran calms her down.”\nWe totally get it, Gracie. You’re not the first tiny creature to fall under Ed’s charming spell.\n\nvia GIPHY \nFortunately for Gracie’s parents, they seem to have found a go-to method in Sheeran’s music, which apparently calms her down every time.\n“She loves all his songs but ‘Shape of You’ and ‘Perfect’ from his new album seem to be her favorites, Gareth said. “I think she’s his youngest fan.” At this point, not a single soul on Earth can deny that Sheeran’s voice has magical properties because its ability to stop a baby from wailing makes it so. So, Ed…can your infant fans get an album full of lullabies already?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T21:58:37.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
