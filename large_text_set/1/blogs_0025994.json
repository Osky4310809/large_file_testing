Charterhouse in London opens to public for first time in 400 years Read more \nThe archives have announced details of the Georgian Papers Programme, in which more than 350,000 usually unseen documents are being made available online over the next four years. \nOn Saturday, the online portal opens for business , allowing anyone, whether an academic or someone with only a vague interest, to go through documents including intimate letters between the king and his wife, Charlotte, household bills, essays, notes about the war in America and menus for grand occasions.

It can change your perspective on history.” \nThe project’s launch coincides with a BBC2 documentary to be broadcast on Monday that follows the early stages of the programme and explores some of the key questions around George’s rule. \nOne of the most fascinating is his mental illness, which would manifest itself in breakdowns where he was confined to Windsor Castle or Kew, sometimes in a straitjacket. \nModern opinion is that it was a form of bipolar disorder. The symptoms – talking ridiculously fast, being excitable and irritable and sexually inappropriate – would be called hypomania today, Sir Simon Wessely, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, tells the programme. \nThe documentary follows researchers opening boxes of papers that have never been properly explored. It includes a draft letter of abdication written by George III during the American war of independence, but never deployed. It was full of crossing out and redrafting, blotches and scrawls.

One, codenamed Aristarchus, writes that the king had been seen walking in disguise in the Queen’s Garden at a time when the French were planning to assassinate him. \nGeorge’s intelligence and love of science is reflected in detailed drawings and calculations he made for the transit of Venus on 23 June 1769, an event he witnessed from his specially commissioned observatory in Richmond Park. \nHe writes, accurately, that such an event will happen again in 1874 and 2004. \nGeorge III took his job very seriously, well tutored by his father, Frederick, who would have been king had he not died, aged 44, in 1751. \nOne document is a manual of kingship written by Frederick for 10-year-old George in which he writes: “Convince this nation that you are not only an Englishman born and bred, but that you are also this by inclination.” \nThat was important and George was the first Hanoverian British king not to have German as his first language. It was during George’s long reign, between 1760-1820, that the union flag was adopted and the term United Kingdom first used. \nFrederick also warned his son to “employ all your hands, all your power, to live with economy”, something he did all his life, preferring a frugal existence on his country estates to the expense and pomp of court life. To understand Trump, we should look to the tyrants of ancient Rome Read more \nThere were many huge events during George’s reign. He was the last British king of America and the first of Australia and he took a keen interest in the exploration of the time including the voyages of Captain Cook to the south seas. \nOne paper reveals secret instructions to Cook that he should treat any locals he finds with respect and “endeavour by all proper means to cultivate a friendship with them, making them presents of such trinkets as you may have onboard … showing them every kindness, civility and regard”. \nThe Georgian papers going online also reveal lots about those around him including his wife and their 15 children, the most famous of which was his eldest son who became Prince Regent, and later George IV. \nThe Prince Regent has gone down in history as a dissolute, extravagant and promiscuous philanderer, one held in some contempt by his father. \nHe was going off the rails as young as 19 and one letter from George III to the prime minister, Lord North, reports that the young prince had got into “a very improper connection with an actress, a woman of indifferent character” who was blackmailing his son. He proposed buying her off for £5,000, about £750,000 in today’s money, which North agreed to. \nResearchers have been going through the papers to decide what to place online first. One of the more poignant discoveries is a note from Charlotte to her children’s nanny Lady Charlotte Finch. It thanks her for her care of Prince Alfred, Charlotte’s 14th child who died aged one year and 10 months, and has sewn into it a lock of blond hair taken from Alfred before he died. \nMany of the documents will have been studied already by historians visiting archives that were established in 1914. But Prof Arthur Burns, academic director for the Georgian Papers Programme at King’s College London, said they could be looked at through different lenses. \nMany academics in the 20th century were looking for the history of “the dead white males” when they researched the Georgian era. Historians today had many different approaches and specialisms and were were good at keeping open lines of communication. “This is the perfect sandpit for us all to meet on and explore those interconnections. Getting people together and having the conversation is going to be a great deal of the fun and intellectual challenge of this,” he said. \n• George III – The Genius of the Mad King is on BBC2 on Monday at 9pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T02:34:00.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
