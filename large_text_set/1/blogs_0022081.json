The 10 Best New TV Shows of 2016 The first season of Stranger Things had a largely unknown cast, but some famous faces, such as Matthew Modine and Winona Ryder, were peppered in to add even more to the 1980s nostalgia permeating the series. In season two, this trend will continue.\nSean Astin and Paul Reiser will join the cast for season two, along with Danish star Linnea Berthelsen.\nAstin, known mostly for his work in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and 80s films like Goonies , will be playing Bob Newby, who went to high school with Joyce and Hopper and now runs a Hawkins RadioShack. He’s been described as a “kind-hearted nerd.”\nAt a Fan2Sea Comic Con cruise panel , David Harbour, who plays Hopper, said that Astin’s character was a former classmate of Hopper and Joyce. Since season two takes place around a year after the events of season one, there are some new dynamics. Astin’s character is now dating Joyce and Hopper isn’t too happy about it.\nReiser, known for Aliens and Mad About You , seems to be taking the place of Modine’s Department of Energy character. He’ll be playing Dr. Owens, who is a high-ranking member of the organization tasked with clean-up after the events of season one.\nBerthelsen is a relative unknown (her IMDB page only contains a few short films) but has been cast as Roman. According to Netflix , Roman is “an emotionally damaged, magnetic young woman who suffered a great loss as a child. Although she does not live in Hawkins, she is mysteriously connected to the supernatural events at the lab…”\nI’m sure there was something intentional about Astin and Reiser’s casting, at least considering their connections with 80s nostalgia properties. Stranger Things has a lot in common with both The Goonies and Aliens , and while both are great actors, there’s also probably an amount of pandering involved–not that there’s anything wrong with that. Stranger Things is all about nostalgia pandering, but it does it well.\nThe three actors join a growing list of new cast members, including Sadie Sink ( Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ) and Dacre Montgomery (from the new Power Rangers film). The two will be playing Max and Billy, who are mysterious step-siblings who live in the town. Max is described as a tough, shy girl with a “complicated history” and Billy as “violent and unpredictable.”\n“There’s definitely a handful of really compelling new characters this season, but absolutely servicing the core group first and foremost,” executive producer Shawn Levy told The Hollywood Reporter . “Like the show itself, it’s multigenerational new characters and really, really intriguing ones.”\nProduction has already begun on our favorite sleeper horror show, which is set to premiere its next season in 2017. The crew has already posted the first image from production.\nsƃuıɥʇɹǝƃuɐɹʇs#\nɹɐǝʎ ʇxǝu noʎ ǝǝs\nuoıʇɔnpoɹd uı ʞɔɐq pic.twitter.com/jYd1tDsPRi\n— Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) November 4, 2016\nCo-showrunner Ross Duffer, in an interview with Vulture , said the gateway to the Upside Down is still open, and Will’s condition after coming back will kickstart season two.\n“This gateway to another dimension is still open, so that’s not a good thing,” Ross said. “Will was in another dimension for a while, so he may not be quite up to par.
