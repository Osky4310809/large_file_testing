has had four 20-20 games so far this season. Naismith Watch: Purdue's Swanigan climbing closer to Hart, Mason III Brian Mull | NCAA.com Contact | Archive | RSS \nThe next important date on the Naismith Trophy schedule is Feb. 9th when the list will be pared to 30 finalists. With conference play heating up, we’re here every Monday to give a rundown of leading contenders for the award, which the Atlanta Tipoff Club has presented to the nation’s premier college basketball player since 1969. \nJosh Hart, Villanova (20.3, 6.8 rpg, 3.5 apg) Synergy Sports Tech The Wildcats closed strong Saturday to overcome a slow start and secure a key Big East road win at Creighton. Hart said the key was simple: The Wildcats played Villanova Basketball down the stretch. It’s a recipe worth following. The defending national champions have won 41 of their last 44 games. Hart had 18 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and three steals against the Bluejays.\nHis season shot chart looks like the Mona Lisa to a hoops analytics lover. He’s launched 176 shots and 150 were at the rim or beyond-the-arc. He’s produced 1.36 points per shot on those attempts, helping the Wildcats’ attack hum along, second in the nation in adjusted offensive efficiency (120.9). Steven Branscombe | USA TODAY Sports Images Villanova Wildcats guard Josh Hart (3) and guard Jalen Brunson (1) have been key for their team so far. Villanova travels to Butler at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday (FS1).\nFrank Mason III, Kansas (19.8 ppg, 5.9 apg, 4.6 rpg) \nvia GIPHY \nHis quickness, strength, toughness and career-best 3-point shooting (48 percent) render him difficult to stop. Mason III had 22 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two steals against the Horned Frogs. \nThe offense runs smoothly when Mason III is involved in the playmaking. He’s shot or assisted on 264 Kansas possessions this season, per Synergy Sports data. The Jayhawks have averaged 1.511 points on those possessions, which places Mason in the top 10 among high-volume players. Kansas welcomes Kansas State to Allen Fieldhouse at 9 p.m. Tuesday (ESPN2). \nLonzo Ball, UCLA (14.3 ppg, 8.1 apg, 5.7 rpg) \nThe Bruins’ freshman point guard sputtered through the first half Wednesday night at Oregon in his Pac-12 debut. In the first nine minutes of the second half, Ball missed two 3-pointers, a layup and committed a turnover. Then, in 108 seconds he proved why he’s special, drilling three 3-pointers to flip momentum in UCLA’s favor. The Bruins, who led by eight with less than four minutes remaining, squandered the lead down the stretch. Scobel Wiggins | USA TODAY Sports IMages UCLA Bruins guard Lonzo Ball (2) has shown a great deal of poise in adjusting to the pace of college ball. But Ball put them in position to become the first visitor in nearly two years to escape Knight Arena with a victory. Two nights later he was brilliant again, recording 23 points, seven assists and six rebounds to lead the Bruins past Oregon State. The Bruins continue to lead the nation in adjusted offensive efficiency (121.7) and next up is a visit from Cal on Thursday. \nLuke Kennard, Duke (21.4 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 2.7 apg) \nThe Blue Devils suffered a humbling 89-75 defeat at Virginia Tech on Saturday afternoon, getting outplayed from the tip to the horn. Kennard did his part, however. He scored 34 points and snagged seven rebounds. It was his second-highest point total of the season and the fourth time he’s eclipsed 24 points in the last six games. Michael Shroyer | USA TODAY Sports Images Duke Blue Devils guard Luke Kennard (5) had 34 points and seven rebounds in a loss to Virginia Tech. Kennard, who leads the ACC in minutes per game (36.0), is shooting better than 50 percent from the field and 40 percent on 3-pointers while averaging 20 points and six rebounds. He and six other players are trying to become the first to generate such widespread production and consistency for an entire season since Creighton’s Doug McDermott did it in three consecutive seasons — 2011 to 2014 . McDermott, of course, won the Naismith Trophy as a senior in 2014.\nWith teammate Grayson Allen suspended and coach Mike Krzyzewski out for the next month due to back surgery, the Blue Devils can’t afford for Kennard to have a lull. Duke receives a visit from Georgia Tech on Wednesday (7 p.m., ESPN2). \nCaleb Swanigan, Purdue (18.5 ppg, 13.0 rpg) \nWhat’s next for the man called “Biggie?” At this rate, a 30-30 game isn’t out of the question. Swanigan dropped 28 points and 22 rebounds on Minnesota over the weekend, although the Boilermakers inability to stop Gophers guard Nate Mason contributed to a 91-82 defeat. Swanigan’s defense, on the other hand, has been excellent. Opponents have scored only 20 points on 50 jump shots where he’s been the primary defender. Trevor Ruszkowski | USA TODAY Sports Images Purdue Boilermakers forward Caleb Swanigan (50) has been a near instant double-double this year. The 6-9, 250-pound forward has made 56 percent of 2s, 41 percent of 3s and is second in the nation in defensive rebounding percentage (33.8). The 11-2 Boilermakers travel to Ohio State on Thursday. \nMalik Monk, Kentucky (22.4 ppg, 2.7 rpg) \nThe Wildcats’ backcourt is an embarrassment of riches. How so? Monk scalded Ole Miss for 34 points on 11-of-16 shooting Thursday and nabbed six rebounds, yet his performance slipped into the back seat because teammate Isaiah Briscoe became the second Wildcats guard to record a triple-double this season. Stephen R. Sylvanie | USA TODAY Sports Images Kentucky guard Malik Monk (5) became a household name with a big performance against UNC. Monk probably won’t join Briscoe and Fox on that list. He’ll have to settle for chasing down the UK freshman record for 3-pointers (113) set by Jamal Murray last season. At his current pace of long-range bombing (3.38 per game), Monk would break the mark in the SEC Championship game, assuming the Wildcats advance that far in the tournament. That seems like a reasonable assumption, at this juncture.\nKentucky plays host to Texas A&M on Tuesday (9 p.m., ESPN). \nDe’Aaron Fox, Kentucky (15.6 ppg, 6.8 apg, 5.0 rpg) \nFox (and Washington freshman Markelle Fultz) could finish this season joining players from power 5 conference schools to average 15 points, six assists and five rebounds since 2009.
