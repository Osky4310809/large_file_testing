But, Disney has confirmed Carrie’s role in The Last Jedi will remain intact . Phew!\nYes, Carrie Fisher finished shooting all of her scenes for Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi before she passed away in December 2016. However, there were rumors of her playing an even bigger role in the final film of the trilogy, fans thought The Last Jedi might have to be reworked to account for that loss.\nAlas, CEO Bob Iger put some of our fears to rest when he spoke at the University of Southern California about Carrie and how her death has impacted the franchise:\n“We’ve had to deal with tragedy this past year because Carrie Fisher passed away tragically in December, and she appears throughout [Episode] 8. What I can say about that is she is in 8 and we’re not changing 8 to deal with her passing. So her performance, which we’re really pleased with, remains as it was in 8.” Okay, so there have been rumors of reshoots for The Last Jedi but it seems like they might just be the typical reshoots for a film. And Bob also shot down any suggestions of digital effects being used to re-create Carrie in the film. Whew!\nSince we’re still totally grieving the death of Carrie, it’s nice to know that we have her performance in Episode VIII to look forward to. See you in theaters on December 15.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:51:15.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
