Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDaniel Sturridge was a top target for Paris Saint-Germain during the January transfer window, reports Goal.com. \nThe French giants seriously considered taking the injury-troubled striker on loan. \nHowever, despite the potentially lucrative return for a player so often surplus to requirements, Liverpool are said to have rejected the move. \n\"The England striker was a premier target for the defending Ligue 1 champions, who were confident he’d complement Edison Cavani superbly in attack,\" the website claims. \nThe move never reached the stage of discussing financial terms. Aldo: Klopp must change transfer policy \nReds legend John Aldridge writes in the Liverpool Echo that there were no revelations in Monday's 3-1 defeat by Leicester. \n\"All that the defeat to Leicester City did was underline what we already knew about this team,\" he said. \n\"The top teams have a balance. They can play football when they’re allowed to, and they can battle and scrap when they’re not. Jurgen Klopp's approach to signings has to change, says Aldridge (Photo: Andrew Powell) \n\"Look at Chelsea. The perfect balance. They can outplay you or outfight you. \n\"When you play in the Premier League, you have to be ready to come up against the teams that play and the teams that fight. And against the latter, Liverpool have been found out repeatedly.\" Cisse recalls the moment that proved Gerrard will be a great boss \nSteven Gerrard proved he will become a great manager during the 2005 Champions League final. \nFormer Liverpool striker Djibril Cisse recalled Gerrard’s inspirational half time team talk in Istanbul which he claims was crucial in their remarkable fightback against AC Milan to win the European Cup. The night where Cisse believed Gerrard would become a great manager (Photo: null) \nLiverpool legend Gerrard, who is taking the first steps towards management after taking up a role in the club’s academy, asked Rafa Benitez to let him do a rabble rousing speech and the rest is history. \nCisse said: “It’s in his DNA, he was talking to us, trying to make us feel like we could give our best. I think he will be a great manager. I don’t know if that’s what he wants to do, but he’s at the academy and it’s a great start for him and I see him as a manager. \nRead the full story here Sturridge's Anfield stay hanging by a thread \nJurgen Klopp will decide Daniel Sturridge ’s future in the summer, writes Mirror Football's David Anderson, amid growing fears the striker is on his way out of Liverpool. \nSturridge’s Anfield fortunes have nosedived under boss Klopp, and the England international has lost his starting place. \nThe 27-year-old, whose £150,000-a-week contract runs until 2019, does not fit Klopp’s high-pressing style. His struggles have alerted West Ham and Stoke, and Klopp says he will make a decision on his future at the end of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T07:40:07.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
