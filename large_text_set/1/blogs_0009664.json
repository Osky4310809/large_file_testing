Photo by David Carson of the Post-Dispatch \nTrouble brewed briefly for August A. Busch IV , who was questioned by police Thursday after he pulled a gun during a confrontation at a bank in Key West, Fla. \nNo arrests were made, no charges were filed and no one was injured, according to a Key West Police Department report. \nThe report was provided to the Post-Dispatch by St. Louis native Adam Linhardt , a Lindbergh High alum and a reporter with the Key West Citizen. \nThe incident occurred about 11 a.m. on the lot of a Bank of America branch, when a man in a pickup truck became angry with Busch for parking in a manner that blocked access to a bank door, the report said. \nA witness to the confrontation said that while Busch walked to an ATM, the pickup driver got out of his vehicle, began yelling at Busch and walked toward him. The witness said Busch pulled out a handgun, but kept it pointed at the ground. \nBusch, 52, of Huntleigh, was cooperative with the responding officer, the report noted, saying he readily admitted to having a gun and then presented the officer with a valid driver's license and concealed-carry permit. \nThe former head of Anheuser-Busch Cos., who ran the brewing giant from 2006 until it was bought out two years later, has had several high-profile dealings with police in his high-profile past. \nIn 1984, Busch avoided criminal charges after a car crash in Arizona that killed a 22-year-old woman. \nIn 1986, Busch was acquitted by a jury of third-degree assault charges in connection with a high-speed police chase in the city's West End. \nThen in 2010, Adrienne Martin , Busch's girlfriend, died of an accidental drug overdose at Busch's estate in Huntleigh. Two years later, Busch paid $1.75 million to settle a wrongful-death civil suit. \nJoe Holleman • 314-340-8254", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:11:47.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
