Lightning strikes nearby then forced players off the ground just before halftime with the Demons leading by four points. \nThe unplanned break forced a change to the schedule for the match as well. Players were told they would return to the ground and play out the remainder of the half once the delay finished before switching ends and beginning the third quarter. \nUmpires returned to the ground around 15 minutes after the match was paused. The players came back on soon after, playing out the remaining three minutes of the half. \nIt did seem to have an impact on the match as Melbourne had the upper hand before the delay — however Lions marquee Sabrina Frederick-Traub goaled less than a minute after the players returned giving Brisbane a two-point lead at the official half-time break. \nThe most recent similar incident in AFL history was in early 2014 when lightning struck the ground during the Sydney derby. \nOn that occasion the Giants and Swans were kept in the change rooms for 25 minutes after making it to quarter-time. Debris had to be cleared from the Spotless Stadium surface. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
