After spending millions of dollars to run an older commercial during Super Bowl LI on Sunday, the company is hosting “block party” events in Los Angeles and New York City to give residents demos of the speaker, and also how it works with its Google Play Music streaming service.\nSee also: What voice commands can I use with Google Home? November 10, 2016 Google says both events are designed to show people how “Google Play Music and Google Home work together seamlessly to provide an amazing in-home music experience”. The LA event is actually taking place close to the beach in Venice, California. If you are in the area, you can go to the Google Home block party at 1515 Abbot Kinney Blvd on Saturday, Feb. 11 and Sunday, Feb. 12. The event will be held both days from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.\nIf you are in the cold and snow-bound New York City, you can still go to its own Google Home block party. It will be held in the Chelsea Market neighborhood at 75 9th Ave on Friday, Feb. 24 and Saturday, Feb. 25 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and again on Sunday, Feb. 26 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nYou can check out a preview of what this block party will look like in the image above. Google has created three tiny houses to showcase how Google Home and Google Play Music can be incorporated in your home. In addition, it has invited stars of popular YouTube channels such as Wong Fu Productions , MyCupcakeAddiction , and Us the Duo to attend as well. They are supposed to show how they use the speaker and the music service in their own lives.\nGoogle appears to be going all out to promote Google Home, and we will have to see if its efforts can make a sales dent in its rivals, particular with Amazon’s Echo device lineup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:28:39.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
