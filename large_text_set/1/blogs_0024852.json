Chuck Schumer's Park Slope apartment building Tuesday as pressure mounts on the Democratic leader to resist President Donald Trump's cabinet picks. \nSchumer has voted yes on four of Trump's cabinet choices, angering many constituents who see any cooperation with Trump as a betrayal. Tuesday's rally, to be held at 6 p.m., will have a \"What the f*ck, Chuck?\" theme \"to demand that Schumer stand firm on the remaining nominees and to rally the Democrats to stand firm,\" organizers with Resist Trump New York said. \nRELATED: Sen. Chuck Schumer's Park Slope Apartment Could be Regular Protest Site \nSchumer's building, on Prospect Park West near Grand Army Plaza, has been a magnet for activists since Trump took office, and some protesters vowed to make the rallies into routine events to remind the senator that his base was watching him closely. \nAs of Monday morning, 2,800 people had RSVPed to say that they would attend the rally, said co-organizer Hae-lin Choi. \n\"The rally will be family friendly, but I think the mood will be angry, because we're asking Schumer to stand up and lead the opposition and so far, he hasn't, said Choi. \"He needs to champion the resistance, or he needs to get out of the way.\" \nChoi, a longtime activist who works for a communications workers union, joined forces with Elizabeth Zeldin to organize protests under the Resist Trump New York umbrella. The two are both Park Slope moms who met when their children went to the same day care, Zeldin said. \n\"[Schumer] is in Brooklyn in the middle of one of the most liberal enclaves in the country and he lives there,\" Zeldin told DNAinfo New York earlier this month. \"He needs to understand that people who voted for him for numerous voting cycles really have this strong feeling.\" \nSchumer's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest protest. The senator on Sunday demanded that Trump reverse the ban on travelers from seven majority Muslim countries that threw airports across the country into chaos and and sparked a spontaneous protest at JFK Airport and a march Sunday in Battery Park . \n\"We are saying ‘no’ to the misguided executive orders because they are bad for America, bad for our national security and because they are so un-American,\" said Schumer, who spoke with an Iraqi refugee who worked for the U.S. Army for 10 years at his side. \"They go so much against what America has always been about.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T18:50:39.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
