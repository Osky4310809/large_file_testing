MWC 2017: Sony introduces the Xperia XZ Premium and XZs with Motion Eye cameras By -   Xperia XZ is the world’s first smartphone with a 4K HDR display and utilises a Snapdragon 835 chip” \nSony has unveiled its next-gen Xperia flagships at its MWC event in Barcelona today. Dubbed the Sony Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZ, the new phones are the world’s first to sport Motion Eye cameras, which offer super slow motion video and new Predictive Capture. \nThe Sony Xperia XZ Premium is the world’s first smartphone to boast a 4K HDR display. It is also one of the first devices to be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 processor. Talking about the Motion Eye cameras, the new Xperias are capable of achieving 960fps slow motion video, which allows slowing down time 4x slower than current camera phones. The devices feature anti-distortion shutters, which minimises rolling shutter. Both features are enabled by the brand’s unique memory-stacked sensor. \nThe Motion Eye cameras are built around 19MP sensors (1/2.3-inch) sitting behind 25mm lenses carrying an aperture of f/2.0. The shooter is accompanied by Predictive and Laser autofocus, and an RGBC-IR sensor that offers natural colour rendering. The camera is capable of 4K video recording, and features improved panorama mode and SteadyShot 5-axis digital stabilisation. Talking about the front shooters, the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZs offer 13-megapixel selfie cameras with Exmor RS mobile image sensor, 22mm wide angle lens, f/2.0 aperture and ISO6400. \nComing to the other specs, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium offers IP68 certification for water and dust resistance, and gets a Glass Loop Surface (Gorilla Glass 5) that wraps the whole device. The phone features a 5.5-inch 4K HDR TRILUMINOS Display and X-Reality mobile picture engine. The 64-bit Snapdragon 835 SoC is mated to Adreno 540 graphics and 4GB of RAM. The storage capacity on board is 64GB, further expandable up to 256GB. It comes with Android Nougat out of the box, a fingerprint sensor embedded into the home button, 4G LTE, a USB Type-C port and a 3,230mAh battery with Qnovo Adaptive charging. \nThe Sony Xperia XZs sports a smaller 5.2-inch full HD TRILUMINOS Display and X-Reality mobile picture engine. The phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, coupled with Adreno 530 GPU and 4GB of RAM. It comes in 32GB and 64GB internal memory variants. This one is fuelled by a 2,900mAh battery with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 and Qnovo Adaptive charging support. Its software, design and connectivity features are the same as the Xperia XZ Premium. \nThe Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes in Luminous Chrome and Deepsea Black hues, while the Xperia XZs is being offered in Ice Blue, Warm Silver and Black colour options. The former will be available globally starting from late Spring 2017, while the latter will go on sale in April. There’s no word regarding their pricing at the moment.
