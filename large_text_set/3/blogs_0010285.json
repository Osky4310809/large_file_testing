During the campaign, no one asked about my age, it was all in-depth political questions. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg is one of Ms Black's closest friends in Westminster \n“What I always say is that trying to tailor politics to be ‘young, hip and cool’ is exactly the kind of patronising guff that puts off young folk.
