'Continued underperformance' \nThe MPs' report said that while there could be no \"single template\" for franchises, there was \"merit\" in obtaining longer agreements covering smaller areas. \nThe opportunity of smaller franchises with less financial risk could lead to new companies appearing on the market, the MPs said. \nThe report comes after the Association of British Commuters applied for a judicial review into the government's handling of the Southern rail crisis. \nThe group says ministers have acted unlawfully by failing to determine whether managers have breached franchise obligations. \nTransport Committee chairman Louise Ellman said: \"While franchising enabled passenger growth and service improvements when it was first rolled out, passenger satisfaction with the railways is falling. \n\"Its core objectives are no longer being met, potential benefits are being lost and the passenger is suffering through higher fares and continued underperformance.\" \nIn January the cost of a rail ticket rose on average by 2.3% , prompting protests at railway stations across the UK. 'Better collaboration' \nThe MPs suggested that a complete restructuring of the system would be \"prohibitively impractical\", but it recommended that as contracts expired the DfT might consider whether they be modified to \"align better with the specific market they serve\". \nThe DfT said Â£40bn was being invested to upgrade the railways and that the franchising system had helped to create one of the safest and fastest growing networks in Europe. \nA spokesman said: \"We can make improvements and the transport secretary has been clear that it will take new ways of working, more investment and better collaboration across the industry to tackle the challenges ahead.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:11:07.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
