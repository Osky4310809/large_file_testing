It was very strange what he said after moving. \n\"I don't regret bringing him to the club. We finished seventh and a lot of that was down to him. He was player of the season last year. \n\"It's ended a bit acrimoniously. Life goes on. In the real world you've got to see it all in perspective. It's a damage-limitation deal.\" \nWest Ham's on-field fortunes have improved somewhat of late following a poor start to the season, their first at London Stadium after leaving their historic Upton Park home. \nAccording to Sullivan, West Ham do not expect to be heavily active on transfer deadline day, with promising youngster Reece Oxford potentially set to go out on loan, the club having opted against a move for their former striker Demba Ba, now of Shanghai Shenhua, who is continuing his rehabilitation from a badly broken leg. \nMarseille man Payet is no mercenary \n\"[We] don't expect much coming in today,\" he said. \n\"We might have a couple of young players going out on loan. Reece Oxford might be going to Reading. \n\"We looked to bring Demba Ba back in this window but were told he was three weeks from playing after recovering from his injury.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T16:32:34.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
