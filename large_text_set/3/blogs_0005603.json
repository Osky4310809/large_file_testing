Arnold, You're Our Pin of the Week Featuring new enamel pins from Midnight Dogs, Brite & Bubbly, Pinaderia, Dysalexic, and Reppin Pins. \nAs the founder of Strike Gently Co , I deal in pins and patches daily. The Creators Project asked me to pull together a weekly roundup of the best newly-released pins. Most of these will probably sell out. If you like them, smash that \"add to cart\" button. \nReppin Pins \nOf all the conflicts in this terrible world of ours, few are win-win. We must remember the eternal conflict: pancakes vs. waffles. You really can't lose. Now you can show the world how much you love carbohydrate-drenched carbohydrates right on your lapel until you bust through it and need to up a size. \n$17.00 here . \nDysalexic \nMost cartoons that try to blend adolescent humor with existentialism are ridiculously dumb but Rick & Morty does it masterly well. Mr. Meeseeks might be the only creature with a real purpose: doing his goddamn job right, and getting the hell out of there. We could all learn something from that. \n$10.00 here . \nPinaderia \nThere are a lot of bad 90s cartoon pins—I've written about a few dozen of them, at least—but this one really tugs the old heart strings. Whether you only had a passing interest in the show or you have a full-blown replica gum shrine in your closet, this pin is for you. (Unless you were born after the 90s, in which case, go play Minecraft or livestream your next \"hang.\") \n$10.00 here . \nBrite & Bubbly \nBright sparkly pins usually only catch my eye for their crazy prices, like $15 or $20 a pop. These are just $5.50. They're sold out for now but will definitely be back soon if my calculations are correct. This company seems young but their prices are cheap as hell for the quality and coolness. Go pillage. \n$5.50 here . \nMidnight Dogs \nMidnight Dogs' bootlegs have taught me an important lesson. It's not the individual bootleg that counts, but the collective taste reflected by however many bootlegs are in a shop at any given time. They've got everything covered, from Sonic to Fellini. As a consumer you must appreciate a you-minded producer—the perfect synergy between bourgeoisie and proletariat! Hail Midnight Dogs! \nFor more pins, visit my shop, Strike Gently Co. \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:27:14.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
