free New York Portfolio Review every year? Because we believe that only the quality of your work should matter — not who you know, how much money you have nor your race, gender, ethnic background or sexual orientation. Applications are now open for the Fifth Annual New York Portfolio Review, sponsored by The New York Times Lens blog and the City University of New York’s Graduate School of Journalism. We are again gathering 150 photographers and 75 of the most influential editors, curators, gallerists and book publishers for two days of private photo critiques on April 29 and 30.\nThis will be an opportunity for people in the photographic community to meet, trade ideas, help each other — and have fun.\nSaturday April 29 will be for all photographers 21 and older. Each participant will receive six private critiques. Sunday, April 30, will be solely for photographers 18 to 27 and will consist of at least four private critiques for each participant, as well as workshops on how to best present, promote and publish your photographs. We will screen all applicants and choose 100 participants for Saturday and 50 for Sunday. All kinds of photographic work — from fine art to photojournalism — are encouraged.\nPlease note: Photographers who attended last year’s review are not eligible to apply this year. Those who attended once in previous years can apply for this year’s review, but they must submit new work and expectations will be higher. Those who have already attended the review twice cannot apply this year.\nOnce photographers are selected, they will submit their top choices of reviewers they like to see their work. We will match participants with as many of those reviewers as possible.\nTo enter, send no more than 20 photos total, from one or two projects, using the form below. The files should be jpegs, 1,200 pixels across and 72 D.P.I. The deadline is Feb. 12 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time. We will inform those who are accepted by March 21.\nNote: Be sure to triple-check the email address you submit for us to contact you. In the past, people have been accepted into the review, but we couldn’t reach them because of a misspelling in their email address. Please don’t let that be you.\nNew York Portfolio Review 2017 First name * Last name * Age * Country Select your country United States Afghanistan Aland Islands Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil British Indian Ocean Territory Brunei Darussalam Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Cape Verde Cayman Islands Central African Republic Chad Chile China Christmas Island Cocos (Keeling) Islands Colombia Comoros Congo Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Cook Islands Costa Rica Cote D'Ivoire Croatia Cuba Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Djibouti Dominica Dominican Republic Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Falkland Islands (Malvinas) Faroe Islands Fiji Finland France French Guiana French Polynesia French Southern Territories Gabon Gambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Greenland Grenada Guadeloupe Guam Guatemala Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Heard and McDonald Islands Holy See (Vatican City State) Honduras Hong Kong Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran, Islamic Republic of Iraq Ireland Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kiribati Korea, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Republic of Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Lao People's Democratic Republic Latvia Lebanon Lesotho Liberia Libyan Arab Jamahiriya Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Macao Macedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Maldives Mali Malta Marshall Islands Martinique Mauritania Mauritius Mayotte Mexico Micronesia, Federated States of Moldova, Republic of Monaco Mongolia Montserrat Morocco Mozambique Myanmar Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands Netherlands Antilles New Caledonia New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria Niue Norfolk Island Northern Mariana Islands Norway Oman Pakistan Palau Palestinian Territory, Occupied Panama Papua New Guinea Paraguay Peru Philippines Pitcairn Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Reunion Romania Russian Federation Rwanda Saint Helena Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Pierre and Miquelon Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Samoa San Marino Sao Tome and Principe Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia and Montenegro Seychelles Sierra Leone Singapore Slovakia Slovenia Solomon Islands Somalia South Africa South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Spain Sri Lanka Sudan Suriname Svalbard and Jan Mayen Swaziland Sweden Switzerland Syrian Arab Republic Taiwan Tajikistan Tanzania, United Republic of Thailand Timor-Leste Togo Tokelau Tonga Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Turks and Caicos Islands Tuvalu Uganda Ukraine United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States Minor Outlying Islands Uruguay Uzbekistan Vanuatu Venezuela Vietnam Virgin Islands (British) Virgin Islands (U.S.) Wallis And Futuna Islands Western Sahara Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe State Select your state Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming American Samoa Guam Northern Mariana Islands Puerto Rico Virgin Islands City Email * Phone number * Website Have you participated in a previous New York Portfolio Review? * Yes No Give us a brief biographical summary of no more than 100 words. * You have 100 words left.\nImages * Upload no more than 20 photos total, from one or two projects.
