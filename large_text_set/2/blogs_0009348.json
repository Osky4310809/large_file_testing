John Legere, the outspoken CEO of T-Mobile , revealed the company’s plans to tweak its ONE unlimited service, starting on Friday, February 17.\nSee also: Thank Facebook Live, Netflix and Spotify for carriers embracing unlimited plans 1 hour ago Legere used his Twitter account to reveal those changes. The big ones will allow current and new ONE unlimited subscribers a way to access HD streaming video, along with 10GB of high-speed data for mobile hotspots, at no extra cost. Those changes match what Verizon currently offers in its unlimited plan. It’s also an improvement over T-Mobile’s previous limit of 480p for streaming video and just 3G speeds for mobile hotspots for its normal ONE plan; you could get HD video and high-speed mobile hotspot data by spending $15 a month more for its ONE Plus plan.\n6/ Starting Fri, #TMobileONE price includes HD video & 10GB high-speed hotspot data –all at no extra charge. AND taxes & fees are included!\n— John Legere (@JohnLegere) February 13, 2017 \n\nLegere also stated that the company will launch a promotion that will price two lines of T-Mobile’s ONE unlimited plan for $100 a month. It’s not yet clear how long this promotion will last. Normally the price for two lines would be $120 a month.\n8/ And, how about a little promo to make it EVEN MORE compelling?! $100 for two lines on #TMobileONE ALL IN.\n— John Legere (@JohnLegere) February 13, 2017 \n\nT-Mobile’s changes to its ONE plan will likely be followed by Sprint and, we hope, AT&T sooner rather than later. Sprint still limits video streaming on its unlimited plan to 480p. More importantly, AT&T’s unlimited plan is limited (no pun intended) just to customers who also sign up for the company’s DirecTV satellite TV service or its U-verse fiber internet provider. AT&T is starting to look like a dinosaur compared to its competition, so hopefully we will see the carrier take some action to take with the other big wireless providers ASAP.\nWhat do you think of T-Mobile’s tweaks to its ONE unlimited plan?
