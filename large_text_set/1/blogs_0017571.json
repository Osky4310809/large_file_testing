That's where Jax steps in and reminds her that their latest mission wasn't a complete failure, as they got a \"piece of the Spear of Desitny and the medallion\" from the Legion. \n\"If I know one thing about you, it's that you don't give up,\" Jax tells the team's captain. \"When you really want something, you are unstoppable. And god help anybody that tries to get in your way. We are going to find him and we're going to bring him home.\" \nLOST MEMORIES — When Damien Darhk (guest star Neal McDonough) and Malcolm Merlyn (guest star John Barrowman) try to capture Rip Hunter (Arthur Darvill) in 1967, they create an Aberration big enough to draw the attention of the Legends. However, when the team arrives they discover that Rip has no memories of his past due to “time drift” and is just a graduate film student. \nAfter trying to convince Rip of who he was, they discover that he possesses an incredibly powerful artifact known as the Spear of Destiny, which the Legion of Doom is after. Ray (Bradon Routh) and Nate (Nick Zano) realize that the Aberration has also affected them personally making it difficult to help the team. Meanwhile, Rory (Dominic Purcell) asks Stein (Victor Garber) for help and makes him promise to keep it a secret from the team. \nCaity Lotz, Franz Drameh and Maisie Richardson-Sellers also star. Dermott Downs directed the episode written by Keto Shimizu & Chris Fedak.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:19:27.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
