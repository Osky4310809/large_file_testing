He loves cars, and he loves disney movies. And he LOVES music.\"\nNicole and Riley Duggan.\nImage: nicole duggan\nShe wrote an open letter on her blog to address the way people behave around Riley in public:\nTo the people that stare at him because he hums, join in with his little singsong because in his eyes he is singing the best song in the world.\nTo the mothers that pull their children away from him, you are creating the bullies of the future. Children don’t notice the differences. They just want to play. Let them.\nTo the lady that called him bold in the supermarket, try to look at things from his perspective. An overload of colours and sounds. People whizzing past you. You too would cry your eyes out if you could not tell anyone how you are feeling when it all gets too much.\n3-year-old Riley loves music.\nImage: nicole duggan\nDuggan says she created the blog to give a more realistic view of living with autism. \"There definitely is a stigma attached to it. But I think people just need to learn more about it,\" she says.\nDuggan says that she really hopes her blog makes a difference to people's attitudes. \"Even if it changes one persons view on autism I'll be happy.\"\nBONUS: Smart ball is a learning tool designed for autistic children", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CAI8KD8IWDJYtfVKj9C1hPpnyvY=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351634%2F3de909aa-e692-484f-af7b-bbb701ddfb95.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/myboyblue2017/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/m0CX2Ptk.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/eY8evuUj67mlkmaqkRpL15OeJFM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351630%2Ff193aa4a-9323-4377-a002-5ea325f98895.jpg", "http://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is.aspx", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ozsEFrJzEGyVAkH1w3ou820LaiE=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351634%2F3de909aa-e692-484f-af7b-bbb701ddfb95.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/myboyblue2017/posts/1250480688338314:0", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vUxgyQywJ7mC_9W6W7bf6C2tFc0=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351630%2Ff193aa4a-9323-4377-a002-5ea325f98895.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/m0CX2Ptk.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-18T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T15:29:44.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
