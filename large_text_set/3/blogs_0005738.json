for being pregnant' as rise in insucure work undermines employees' dignity, MPs told \n'While there is no crisis in quantity of jobs, there is a clear crisis in terms of the quality of those jobs',   14:07 GMT Click to followThe Independent Online TUC's Hannah Reed cited examples of female workers who were told to leave warehouse jobs after telling their employer they were pregnant Rex \nBritain has become a nation where women can effectively be sacked on the spot for being pregnant, workers must carry around their uniforms at all times in case they are called upon to do a shift at a moment’s notice and people’s basic dignity is being undermined by employers, MPs heard on Tuesday. \nMore than five million people now work through zero-hours or agency contracts and through “ fake self-employment ”, often via apps, that do not grant employment rights or guaranteed hours. \nThis has lead to a “large-scale, structural change in working arrangements that is systematically undermining the power that employees have in relation to employers,” said Steven Devlin, senior economist at the New Economics Foundation. Surge in insecure work costs UK £4bn in lost taxes \n“While there is no crisis in quantity of jobs there is a clear crisis in terms of the quality of those jobs.” Mr Devlin told the Business Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. \nMr Devlin said that there was a growing body of research that showed the key things affecting people’s well-being in relation to work are security, dignity and agency. \n“This type of work doesn’t just threaten security but also those other planks of dignity in terms of the level of surveillance that they are often exposed to and the routinisation of some of the tasks which undermines the agency that they have,” Mr Devlin said. Read more Agency staff to hit one million in Britain, warns charity \nIn December, Amazon was accused of “dehumanising” its warehouse staff by filming their every move and penalising them if they did not pick an item every seven seconds. \nWhile flexibility could be a positive for some people, only 61 per cent of workers are now in secure and well-paid job, and the trend has been downward over the last four years, Mr Devlin said. \nHannah Reed, senior employment rights officer at the TUC spoke of instances where women on agency contracts have informed their employer they are pregnant and simply been told to leave or not called again and offered any further work. \n“That is clearly sex discrimination; clearly a breach of the law,” she said, but many people on agency contracts are not aware of their rights. \nThe trend towards insecure work is not only bad for those doing it, but for the country as a whole, MPs heard. \n“It means loss to the exchequer in terms of lost revenues, for the individual in terms of heightened insecurity but also labour market as a whole, Ms Reed said.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.
