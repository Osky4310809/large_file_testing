Your city will stand by you.” \nDe Blasio detailed a few ways the city plans to assuage parents’ fears and resist ICE. His office, he said, will be instructing school employees to understand what to do in which ICE agents appear at a school. The agents, he said, will be kept outside the school buildings and schools will not share information with them unless required by the law. \nNo, it’s not “your city” and that’s sort of the point. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nBut even beyond the school, the city is going to spend taxpayer dollars helping counsel people how to resist ICE and to resist deportation. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nThe city will also facilitate workshops for parents to get questions answered about their rights in general and how they can get help. They have planned over 100 Know Your Rights workshops in boroughs throughout the city which will inform families where they can seek legal assistance, and free immigration services if they are facing the threat of deportation. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \nHe’s also cool with shielding drunk drivers from ICE enforcement as well. \nAs a practical matter, the Mayor is posturing. \nBecause ICE wouldn’t be going in the schools without warrants in any event and if they had them, the schools couldn’t stop them. \nSo the Mayor is simply posturing to be anti-Trump and burnish up his progressive bona fides for his anticipated run for president in 2020. \nBut he’s using the money of the people of the city of New York to do it. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:22:46.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
