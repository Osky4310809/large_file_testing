Photo by Josh Albelda/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines – The Star Hotshots came just 7 points shy of breaking their franchise record biggest winning margin when they blew out the hapless Meralco Bolts, 120-73, in the 2017 PBA Philippine Cup on Saturday, January 28 at the Ynares Center in Antipolo. \nThe Hotshots shot the lights out with 17 makes from beyond the arc, while the Bolts had only 6 triples by contrast to make it to a 6-4 record, with a chance of clinching solo second and the last twice-to-beat advantage in the quarterfinal round should they defeat the Mahindra Floodbuster in their final game. \nStar nearly set a new franchise record for biggest win margin when they led by as much as 55 points, 104-49, after a Jio Jalalon layup with over 8 minutes to go in the payoff period. The Hotshots also had a 53-point advantage with over two minutes left. \nAccording to PBA statistician Fidel Mangonon III, Star was already holder of this conference's biggest win margin at 44 points after a 123-79 victory over Phoenix in December of 2016. \nMeralco, on the other hand, set a new all-time worst loss after previously experiencing a 44-point beating, 139-95, at the hands of Rain or Shine over 5 years ago in the same Antipolo venue, per Mangonon. \nAllein Maliksi led the surging Star with 25 points on 5 three-pointers as well as 5 rebounds in just 3 quarters of play. Jalalon and Paul Lee each had 15 markers while Aldrech Ramos chipped in 13. \nIan Sangalang and Justin Melton conspired for 20 points in the big win that saw Star dominate in assists, 22-14, and notched a 56% shooting clip. \nReigning Rookie of the Year Chris Newsome was the only player in double figures for Meralco with 13 points along with 5 rebounds and 4 assists. \nThe Bolts, who shot a dismal 38% from the field, finished the Philippine Cup with a 3-8 record – just a two-game improvement from their 1-11 season-opening conference performance from last year. \nScores : Star (120) : Maliksi 25, Lee 15, Ramos 13, Melton 10, Barroca 10, Sangalang 10, Abundo 8, Reavis 4, De Leon 3, Abundo 3, Dela Rosa 2, Brondial 2, Pingris 0.
