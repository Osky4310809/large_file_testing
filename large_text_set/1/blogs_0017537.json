The winners will be announced on Feb. 25 — the day before the Oscars are handed out.\nSee below for the full list of this year’s Razzie nominees.\n37th Annual Golden Raspberry (RAZZIE®) Award Nominations \nWORST PICTURE\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \nDirty Grandpa \nGods of Egypt \nHillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party \nIndependence Day: Resurgence \nZoolander No. 2 \nWORST ACTOR \nBen Affleck / Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \nGerard Butler / Gods of Egypt & London Has Fallen \nHenry Cavill / Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \nRobert de Niro / Dirty Grandpa \nDinesh D’Souza [as Himself] / Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party \nBen Stiller / Zoolander No. 2 \nWORST ACTRESS\nMegan Fox / Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows \nTyler Perry / BOO!
