LUCIE — You want inspiration here at First Data Field?\nLook away from the marketing gimmick that will take place at 11 o’clock Monday morning , in the press conference room. Look instead at the Mets’ starting second baseman two hours later, when they take on the Astros.\n“I hope I can inspire others to chase their dream,” T.J. Rivera said Sunday, before the Mets’ 5-2 victory over the Tigers. “That’s always been one of my goals, to show people they can chase whatever it is they want to do.\n“But I also don’t want people to feel like it’s some kind of crazy story just because I wasn’t drafted. I want to feel like one of the other guys.”\nTim Tebow, whose Mets number 15 is emblazoned on T-shirts that can be purchased at the sales hut outside the ballpark — Curtis Granderson’s number 3, on the contrary, is nowhere to be found — arrived at the minor league complex Sunday. On Monday, the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner and former Jets quarterback will meet with the media to herald the kick off of his first full season trying to play professional baseball.\nOn Sunday afternoon, Terry Collins appeared as interested in discussing Tebow as if he had been asked about the Oscars. SEE ALSO \nThe Tim Tebow show hits Mets camp 0:0 PORT ST. LUCIE — The big top is now open... “I’ve got enough on my plate at the moment,” he said, sporting a weary smile.\nThe Mets’ best decision of the season might prove to be assigning Tebow, the human click bait, to minor league camp and limiting his interactions with the big league club to a few Grapefruit League games.\nTebow can motivate folks with his effort. Rivera can make an impact with his results.\nLast September, when the Mets signed Tebow for $100,000, general manager Sandy Alderson invoked the names of the undrafted Rivera, who signed his first professional contract with the Mets in 2011, and Seth Lugo, selected in the 34th round of the 2011 draft, as examples of guys defying the odds.\nRivera’s case especially resonated because of his Bronx roots. When he finally made the majors last season at age 27 and put up a .333/.345/.476 slash line in 33 games — he started at second base in the National League wild-card game and doubled off Giants ace Madison Bumgarner in the Mets’ eventual 3-0 elimination loss — his accomplishment reverberated at home.\n“I was able to do some appearances,” Rivera said. “I was able to go back to my school [Lehman High], which the Mets were able to set up, and speak to the kids. That was awesome.”\nRivera (54) in the Mets dugout on Feb. 26 Anthony J. Causi Nevertheless, he spent most of his offseason in quiet Prattville, Ala., with his wife, training to build on his taste of the majors. When Neil Walker accepted the Mets’ qualifying offer to return as the starting second baseman, it ensured a tougher path for Rivera (with minor league options remaining) to make the big-league club out of camp. Yet with all of the injury questions here, “He’s a legitimate candidate to make this club,” Collins said.\n“There’s a lot of things as ballplayers we can’t control, and that’s the business aspect of the game,” Rivera said. “I know the depth we have here is unbelievable. … So I kind of just want to be positive, in any way help the team. Bench, outfield, infield, whatever. I’m trying to make as many possibilities as I can.”\nHe has been taking fly balls despite never having played the outfield, and Collins said Rivera could see some time in left field. He also is part of the first-base mix, with Lucas Duda sidelined and Jay Bruce getting reps there — and Michael Conforto slamming his second homer in three days to push for Bruce’s right-field gig — and third base, too, where David Wright is no guarantee to be ready.\nRivera said he hasn’t met Tebow, an undrafted free agent, too, who is a year and about two months Rivera’s senior.\n“It’s a cool story. I know a lot of people have different thoughts on it, but I get where he’s coming from,” Rivera said. “He wants to chase a dream that he’s had, so you can’t hate him for that. You’ve got to really respect that. … I’m sure a lot of fans will be happy to see him play.”\nThe Mets are banking on that. Yet when it comes to which long shot will pay off most on the field, bet on Rivera.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:52:00.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
