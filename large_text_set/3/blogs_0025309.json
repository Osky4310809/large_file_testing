The close-up photograph shows the bearded man, lying on a trolley and surrounded by paramedics. \nThe paper said the \"savage assault on democracy\" was the UK's worst atrocity since the London attacks of 2005. \nThe Scottish Sun carries the same photograph of the terror suspect. Inside, its reporter Harry Cole told how he watched \"in admiration\" as Tory MP Tobias Ellwood fought to save the life of the policeman who was repeatedly stabbed in the attack . \nMr Ellwood, a foreign office minister who lost his brother in the Bali terrorist bombings in 2002, also features on the front page of the i newspaper. An earlier edition of the paper - featuring an image of the bloodied leg of a victim on Westminster - led to some criticism on social media. Editor Oliver Duff explained why it was changed, saying it was poor judgement and the controversial image risked diverting attention from the story itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:51:45.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
