Now, the Fear of God designer has debuted his second sneaker in form of the simply named “Basketball Sneaker.”\nThe silhouette seems to take after the classic Nike Dunk/Jordan 1 model, as perforations on the toebox and premium leather upper are shaped similarly. On the contrary however, a chunky midsole and rugged outsole offer a tougher feel, while the look is wrapped up with contrasting tones of black and white all over.\nThe sneakers look to be part of Fear of God’s upcoming fifth collection; stay tuned for further updates concerning the “Basketball Sneaker.”\n🇫🇷 leaving the @vetements_official show… vetements hooded bomber x @fearofgod fitted x bball tank and #fifthcollection basketball sneakers… 📸 @bleumode \nA photo posted by jerrylorenzo (@jerrylorenzo) on Jan 24, 2017 at 11:06am PST \n\n@vetements_official 🙏🏽 \nA video posted by jerrylorenzo (@jerrylorenzo) on Jan 24, 2017 at 11:13am PST \n\nmore leaked images… #fifthcollection …the #basketballsneaker 🇫🇷 \nA photo posted by jerrylorenzo (@jerrylorenzo) on Jan 24, 2017 at 12:56pm PST \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:50:17.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
