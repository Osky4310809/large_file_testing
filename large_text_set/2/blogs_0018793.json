Refugees the 'first target' \n\"The limits of what is acceptable have shifted. Politicians are shamelessly and actively legitimising all sorts of hateful rhetoric and policies based on people's identity: misogyny, racism and homophobia. The first target has been refugees and, if this continues in 2017, others will be in the crosshairs.\" \nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on the report. \nAmnesty's report cited an example of divisive propaganda in the UK. \nIn June, the former leader of the far-right, anti-immigration United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), Nigel Farage, infamously unveiled a poster showing a queue of refugees with the slogan \"Breaking Point: The EU has failed us all\" as he campaigned for Brexit. \n\"The [UK] government has shirked its responsibility for the global refugee crisis, pushing thousands of vulnerable people into the hands of people smugglers. \n\"Its decision to prematurely close the Dubs Amendment scheme to bring unaccompanied refugee children already in Europe to the UK is shameful,\" the report said. \nThe annual study, \"The State of the World's Human Rights\", documented what it called \"grave violations of human rights\" in 159 countries in 2016, including Bangladesh, Thailand, Honduras and Myanmar , where \"tens of thousands of Rohingya people - who remain deprived of a nationality - have been displaced by 'clearance operations' amid reports of unlawful killings\".
