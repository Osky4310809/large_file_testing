It can be dangerous to work in winter's icy cold. \nWorkers who face brutally cold weather and unpredictable winter conditions top our list for some of the toughest winter jobs. They have to take extreme caution since the risk for hypothermia, dehydration and slips and falls are ever present during outdoor winter jobs. \n1. Power-line technicians and meter readers \nOne of the ways power companies try to avoid having crews in the harsh winter weather is by scheduling bigger construction jobs during the fall or spring. Not only is it easier at those times for those linemen to be outside, but it is a safer time for the power to go out if needed. \n\"We have linemen out there in storms working around the clock to restore power,\" Todd Meyers, with West Penn Power, said. \nMeyers said linemen dress in multiple thin layers, use hand warmers and wear snow chains for their boots. \nLinemen work to restore power on a National Grid powerline in New York. (AP Photo/Mike Groll) \n\"Job briefings are held every morning to refocus them and to get them thinking it's going to be cold,\" Meyers said. \nThe crew can't be worried about the temperature because they need to be focused on the electricity. \n\"If they lose focus, there could be deadly consequences,\" Meyers said. \nLinemen have to take periodic breaks in their truck to warm up. This often frustrates customers without power; however, it is crucial for workers to warm up. \n2. Airport ramp agents \nWinter brings a whole new set of challenges for ramp agents because of brutal cold and wind. \nWhen weather deteriorates, airport ramp agents face a tough time keeping up with all the snow, ice, bags and more. It can be a dangerous job once blizzard or whiteout conditions unfold. \nOn top of lifting heavy bags and deicing airplanes, ramp agents have to be cautious of slippery ramp surfaces. Online job posting for a ramp agent will often say it is preferred the employee is knowledgeable about work safely in outdoor weather conditions. \nThis posting lists the physical demands for the position include lifting up to 70 pounds, pushing, reaching, standing, stooping and climbing steps/stairs. \nAn airport worker tries to clean snow off of an aircraft.

According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), it is not safe to wear tight clothing because it reduces blood circulation. \nThe crews must be aware of trench foot, which is a non-freezing injury of the feet caused by prolonged exposure to wet and cold conditions. According to OSHA, the injury occurs because wet feet lose heat 25 times faster than dry feet. It's a very cold day @flyYXE ! A big shout out to the ramp agents! Thanks guys for all you do! KUDOS! Stay warm! #yxe #rampagents #socold — Saskatoon Airport (@fly_skyxe) January 21, 2013 \nAirport baggage and fuel workers do their jobs as snow falls at Philadelphia International Airport.

Deliverers (UPS, mailmen) \nUPS has winter weather training for all of their drivers, and sometimes a penguin comes to visit for training purposes. \nGreg and Bubba the penguin.

Walking can be challenging or even treacherous in winter conditions, especially while holding packages. \n\"All new UPS drivers are trained on the Slip and Fall machine; it teaches drivers how to fall correctly,\" Dan McMackin, UPS public relations officer, said. \nIt is like an air hockey surface with special shoes and a harness that catches trainees. \n\"We teach our drivers be aware of the warning signs for frostbite and hypothermia,\" McMackin said. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T08:58:11.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
