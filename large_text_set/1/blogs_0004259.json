Yaya Toure, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and John Stones all found the net in a simple win over Slaven Bilic's men, their fifth in six matches in all competition. \nGuardiola has now overseen five wins in six games, but a 1-0 defeat at Liverpool in that time damaged title ambitions at the Etihad Stadium. \nAnd with the knockout rounds of the Champions League also looming, Guardiola wants a better big-game mentality from his players and fans. \n\"We were able to keep the ball better than the last games and we created more chances. Before the penalty, we had three or four chances and with the second and third goals it was easier for the second half,\" Guardiola told BBC Sport. \n\"It is important to win away, it is not easy. Hopefully it can help us to make our players believe that they are good enough to play every game. \n\"I would like to involve our fans and they can believe that we are good. \n\"I do not know what happened in the past but we are good guys, so all the season we run a lot, fight a lot, playing good, sometimes not playing good. \nMan City start week in crisis and end it in cruise control \n\"But they have to believe they can compete everywhere against every team.\" \nGuardiola also denied reports that City have made a move for Bayern Munich's Holger Badstuber, stating that he is \"still a Bayern Munich player\" .
