The iPhone may not be the best phone these days, but the iPad is definitely still the best tablet. And because there are so many models these days, it&apos;s easier than ever to find the cheap iPad deals of your dreams.\nWhether you&apos;re after a deal on an iPad Air 2 from this year or an iPad mini from a couple of years ago, we&apos;ve found the best deals so you don&apos;t have to.\nHere are the best cheap iPad deals on all available models... \n\niPad Pro 9.7-inch deals The new iPad Pro 9.7 arrives instead of an iPad Air 3 \nIf you want the very best standard iPad, this is it - the new iPad Pro 9.7. It arrived in March 2016 instead of an iPad Air 3 and packs many of the outstanding features of the iPad Pro 12.9-inch model. That's great news for anyone who wanted pro features in a smaller design.\n\niPad Pro 12.9-inch deals The biggest and best iPad ever \nThe iPad Pro isn't a laptop replacement in the way power users will hope. But it is, by some distance, one of the most brilliant tablets ever released. Using its enormous 12.9-inch screen is simply gorgeous and the power inside is unrivalled in the tablet world. So to anyone that wants an iPad with more power, a better media and reading experience and more abilities than ever before, there's no question here. Go for the iPad Pro and you'll love it.\n\niPad Air 2 deals Simply the best 'normal' iPad available - and the best tablet fullstop \nApple improved on perfection with the iPad Air 2. And now that the iPad Pro 9.7 has hit the shelves, this brilliant tablet is available at an all time low price. The combination of power, better screen, improved design and upgraded OS make this a very, very compelling device - and that's before getting into the fact the app ecosystem is so much stronger than on Android. It's even better now iOS 9 is capable of scaling apps so seamlessly - the days of low-res iPhone apps are gone. Here are the best cheap iPad Air 2 deals currently available...\n\n\niPad Air deals It's a year older but this iPad is still a fantastic tablet \nIt's a joy to hold the iPad Air - even though it's now the thicker option compare to the iPad above. From the clever construction to the fast processor to the improved user interface, this iPad may be a bit older but it's still excellent. Choose a cheap iPad Air deal from these options we've found:\n\n\niPad mini 4 deals The best 7-inch tablet ever made \nOne of the major changes with the iPad mini 4 over last year's mini 3 is its design. It may look the same, but it's been slimmed down from 7.5mm to a wafer thin 6.1mm. It's also now more powerful, has a stunning screen and the battery is still a 10-hour beast. The A8 processor is a good step up from the A7 inside the mini 3 so if you're going to play 3D games or throw around some of the more hefty iPad apps from the App Store, this is certainly your best option.\n\n\niPad mini 3 deals The best iPad mini currently available \nIf you want an iPad mini - this is another great option because it's almost as good as the iPad mini 4 above, but there are some great iPad deals on this to be had, too. The 7.9-inch screen is the perfect size in our opinion - you can hold it in one hand but it's still big enough to be satisfying when you watch videos or browse the web. Here's every cheap iPad mini 3 deal you could ever want, and then some...\n\n\niPad mini 2 deals The first iPad mini with Retina display is a deal-tastic marvel \nIf you're looking for the best iPad deal you might well find it on this iPad right here. Deals on this iPad fluctuate regularly - you can often find it for cheaper than the iPad mini 3 but sometimes it's more expensive, depending on retailers and stock levels. If the iPad mini 3 above is cheaper, definitely get that one over this! Here are the best cheap iPad mini 2 deals currently available...\n\n\niPad mini deals The cheapest iPad out there but it&apos;s still a winner \nSo the original iPad mini may not have a Retina display but it&apos;s available for well under Â£200 and so for the right deal it&apos;s still worth your while considering. Again though, if the price is similar to the iPad deals above, get the ones above if for no other reason than the super-sharp Retina displays they offer. Here are the best cheap iPad mini deals we can find...\n\n\n\nTry our new Google Chrome add-on and never pay more than the cheapest prices ever again! \nPricehawk is a Chrome extension that will automatically find you the cheapest deals for the tech and games items you're shopping for online.
