Will Russell Westbrook get the crown if he finishes with a season-long triple-double, allowing him to match Oscar Robertson as one of two players in league history to accomplish such a feat? Could LeBron James sneak into the lead by virtue of boasting such monumental impact on his troops' success? Will James Harden hold up a trophy for giving his team an identity and then pushing it toward the top of the Western Conference? No one knows yet, and that's largely because voters often weigh factors differently. Some ignore narratives in favor of numbers. Others use a combination of the two. Some exclude any players from teams that aren't at the top of their conference. Others won't consider players on squads with other potential candidates. Here, narratives, historical uniqueness and team success are irrelevant. Only a player's impact on his team matters, allowing MVP to literally stand for most valuable player. We started by determining each NBA team's best player, as signified by NBA Math's total points added (TPA) as of March 17 (when data collection began). We then looked at all 30 players' on/off differentials per possession and multiplied that by the number of possessions they've played. The top 10 MVP candidates were ranked from those results. You can find each player's score next to his name. Notable Exclusions Ronald Cortes/Getty Images James Harden, Houston Rockets Though there's no doubt James Harden has fundamentally changed how the Houston Rockets approach the game's offensive end. But the numbers don't all work in his favor. Despite the gaudy statistics he's produced, his overwhelming involvement whenever he's on the floor and the team's overall success, Houston still manages to function when he's riding the pine. The Rockets have a sterling 7.1 net rating with Harden on the court, but that number only falls to 4.8 without him. And though that's more a reflection on the strength of the unit led by Eric Gordon and Lou Williams, it still works against him in this particular competition. Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio Spurs Even though Kawhi Leonard should factor into the Defensive Player of the Year conversation yet again, his inability to positively impact the San Antonio Spurs' point-preventing metrics has been a source of consternation throughout the year. Whether it's simply due to bad luck, schematic issues, teams willingly playing four-on-four while leaving him in the corner or some other undiscovered explanation, the Spurs have been better defensively with him off the courtâ€”8.3 points per 100 possessions better, in fact. Leonard does take his troops to unimaginable levels on the scoring end, but that can only just mitigate the decline in stinginess. The overall product shows the Spurs have found nearly as much success without their clear-cut superstar as they have with him, and a net rating improvement of 0.5 won't get the job done here. Isaiah Thomas, Boston Celtics The Boston Celtics point guard isn't really in the MVP conversation. Even The Ringer's Bill Simmons won't include him in the race, despite his fourth-quarter excellence and the explosive nature of the scoring prowess contained within his diminutive frame. But Isaiah Thomas has still blossomed into such a notable player that it might seem weird to have him outside the top 10. Blame his defense if you must, because the 4.1-point jump in net rating when he's on the floor only lifts him to No. 19 in this countdown. 10.
