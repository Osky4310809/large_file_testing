Photo by Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net Some players are fine with sitting out games because of injury, but Jasmine Nabor is not one of them. Not even a benign tumor won’t stop Nabor from playing for her beloved National University. But on Sunday, Nabor had to be wheeled out of Filoil Flying V Centre’s playing court and into the Lady Bulldogs’ dugout because of a sore knee. ADVERTISEMENT That was the product of the tumor that has developed just above Nabor’s left knee and the 18-year-old setter has hid her injury from head coach Roger Gorayeb fearing she won’t be able to play anymore for NU. “I was afraid to tell coach Roger because he might not let me play,” said Nabor after the Lady Bulldogs swept Adamson 25-15, 25-22, 25-19. “Of course I want to help the team in whatever way possible so I hid the injury.” Nabor had three points and 29 excellent sets for NU but she sat out the whole third set. She added only she and the team’s physical therapist know about the injury and she would have it checked every time they ended practice. “I just tried to endure it and I get it checked with our physical therapist who also hid it from coach Roger.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:52:12.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
