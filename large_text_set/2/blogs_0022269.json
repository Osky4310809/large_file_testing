Frank de Boer struggled to turn Inter Milan's fortunes around. \n\"I would love to manage here [in the Premier League],\" De Boer said. \"But the project has to be right. \n\"I told Liverpool I was honoured but I was only one year in at Ajax, it was too soon. I needed to achieve more, and I did.\" \nThe former Netherlands international won four consecutive Eredivisie titles with Ajax between 2011-14 before departing for the San Siro. \n\"Leaving Ajax after 25 years as player, coach and manager was hard, but sometimes you are saying the same things, you need a new challenge, like Pep [Guardiola],\" De Boer added. \"But at Inter I had to deal with so many things away from football, you lose energy. \n\"Every time you thought: 'Finally, a good result, everything has calmed down,' then comes Mauro Icardi's book [in which the captain criticised the club's Ultras] or Marcelo Brozovic is in the discotheque and you have to punish him. We only had three months but honestly, it felt like a year.\" \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
