Because Tom Hiddleston live-narrated a viral pregnant giraffe webcam , and it is our everything. How did this strange occurrence come about, you ask? Fair question.\nThe Animal Adventure Park Zoo in upstate New York set up a webcam to watch April, a 15-year-old giraffe , give birth. The live feed has been extremely popular; literally hundreds of thousands of people have logged in to see April in labor, because, um, who doesn’t want to see a 6-foot-tall baby animal being born?!\nAnyway, Tom Hiddleston provided a dramatic narration for the live-feed during his visit to BBC Radio 1 (with hardly any context for what the feed he was watching was about), and we like. We like it a lot!\n“Look at that magnificent long neck. Alice washes herself, swishes her tail magnificently around her quarters. She takes a bow, she knows the world is watching. It’s breakfast time. Welcome, to Alice’s room.” \nYeah, he mixed up April with Alice, but let’s face it, Hiddleston can do whatever he wants. We love how he took the assignment so seriously and used his best “narration” voice. David Attenborough, watch out!\nvia GIPHY FYI April still hasn’t given birth, and people are getting antsy.\nMe waiting for April the giraffe to have her baby. #AprilTheGiraffe #giraffewatch pic.twitter.com/9QBHeMaMLL \n— Kelly G (@kgsmalls_) February 24, 2017 #giraffewatch day 8. there's no baby. she's just bloated and can't find pants that fit right. it's cool, april. we've all been there.\n— Erika (@UVAHooGirl) March 2, 2017 Hey baby giraffe, #giraffewatch pic.twitter.com/POvo6KNiB1 \n— Jon Dougherty (@JonDTWCNews) March 2, 2017 My plans for today? Probably watching a giraffe not have her baby. @AprilTheGiraffe #giraffewatch pic.twitter.com/Z8JHFEhx9D \n— Pattie Martin (@PattieAbc13) March 1, 2017 April probably is too, because she’s been pregnant for 15 months.\nIf you want to check out the live cam to see what all the fuss is about, you may enjoy it right here and now. It’s better with Hiddleston’s commentary…just FYI. April is pretty cute though.\nYou can do it, girl!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T19:45:54.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
