(Photo: PA) \nOne MP said he looked “very uncomfortable” between the pair. \nThe meeting came after Mr Watson warned Labour faces a \"high-stakes\" battle for its future. \nModerate backbencher Ian Austin referred to “our so called leader” and demanded to know why Mr Corbyn was not answering questions, as PLP chairman John Cryer responded. \nAn MP branded Mr Corbyn’s silence “unbelievable”. (Photo: Getty) \nOne MP said there had been “total condemnation” of the party chief while another described “an absolute roasting” for the leader. \nWhen Mr Corbyn did tackle a couple of questions, he was heckled, sources said. \nAn angry exchange blew up between Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry and Wes Streeting after she told the backbencher “You need to calm down\" as he spoke up. \nMr Streeting hit back: “Don’t tell me to calm down,\" according to insiders. \nRaised voices could be heard outside the committee room, and when the stormy meeting broke up, stunned MPs emerged looking shell-shocked, many with faces white with anger. \nA veteran peer, asked if the situation was similar to the turbulence of the 1980s, replied: “No, no - it is much, much worse than that.” \nAnother MP left the rooming, exhaling: “F***’s sake.” (Photo: Getty) \nMr Corbyn grimaced and left the room alone, walking down the committee room corridor by himself as aides scrambled to explain the angry scenes. \nA senior Labour source claimed there had been “a robust and open debate”. \nMr Corbyn suffered another blow as his favoured candidate failed to make the shortlist for the Manchester Gorton by-election, triggered by the death of veteran Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman.
