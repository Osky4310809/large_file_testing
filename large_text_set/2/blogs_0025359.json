Doctors have told her to wait a week to see if the spinal injection will reduce the swelling and pain. Sharon says she has had an epidural but is still in pain (Photo: Getty) \nSpeaking in the US Sharon said: “Right now I happen to have trapped nerve in my back and it’s killing me. \n“I have a trapped nerve...a pinch between my L3 and L4 and I had to have, what is it when you have a baby, an epidural. There was no baby, but I had an epidural and I woke up to no baby, just a bad back. \n“Anyway, um yes. That’s why I wasn’t in last week. “ \nReflecting on her recovery, she admitted: “I wait another week and if it hasn’t fixed it then I have to have surgery.” \nSharon, 64, admitted she is undergoing daily physical therapy sessions to try and rectify her problems. \nShe says that she has no idea how the pain really started: “I just bent down “I bent down picking something up. Nothing, nothing, nothing and it was like ‘oh that was a bit rough’ when I came back up and I didn’t think anything of it. \n“A couple of hours later it was like a stabbbing pain.” \nSharon is renown for her medical woes.

I was completely insane. And especially if there was an emergency I would be the one screaming and waving arms in the air. \n“It was really like pressure and stress the whole time. \n“Now it has just gone way down.” \nAsked what has helped the change, she replied: “I think different medication.” \nIn 2015 Sharon revealed that she took a month off work after she “had gone crazy for a while”. \nThe famous TV star was struck down by a debilitating bout of depression.

I had gone a bit crazy for a while. I suffer with really bad depression from time to time . \n“It is heinous, you know that.” The TV star says she suffered depression for years (Photo: Getty) \nDoctors then worked with with mental health specialists to find medication to steady her mental troubles She added: “I couldn’t get on a medication that could help so it was all these trial and errors. it is awful to be put on medication that somehow sends your body crazy and your head crazier than it already is and then it is like argh!. \n“I tried loads of medications. “I probably tried four or five different until I found one that suited my chemistry and now I am back today.” \nIn 2014 Sharon opened up that she has been “popping pills for 16 years” to cope with depression. \nAnd the TV star insists “she couldn’t live without” that medication to keep her mind sane and balanced. Sharon insisted that she had not disclosed her battle for a long time publicly as she has much self-doubt.
