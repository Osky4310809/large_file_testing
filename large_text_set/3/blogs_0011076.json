The sentence was later reduced to a minimum of eight years. Andrew Parsons/PA Wire/PA Images Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman \nBlackman’s wife, Claire, spoke at a press conference after the ruling. \nShe said: “We are delighted at the judge’s decision to substitute manslaughter with diminished responsibility. \n“This is a crucial decision and one that much better reflects the circumstances that my husband found himself in during that terrible tour of Afghanistan.” \nShe added that the family hopes to secure a “significant reduction” in his sentence following today’s ruling. \nThe sentencing hearing is due to be held at a later date. Sky News Claire Blackman speaking to reporters after Wednesday's ruling. \nThe panel of judges, headed by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, were urged to overturn the “unsafe” murder conviction on the basis of “uncontradicted” evidence from three distinguished psychiatrists that Blackman was suffering from a mental illness - an adjustment disorder - at the time of the killing. \nJonathan Goldberg QC said at a hearing in February that the key “stressors” were Blackman’s perception of poor leadership above him, isolation, a family history of depression, an earlier near-fatal grenade attack and the death of a colleague he had mentored. \nHis disorder substantially impaired his ability to form a rational judgment or exercise self-control and this would have affected his ability to know whether the insurgent was alive or not. \nRichard Whittam QC, for the Crown, said there was no evidence to the contrary about Blackman having an adjustment disorder but the issue was “did it cause what happened”. \nIn May 2014, the Court Martial Appeal Court rejected a conviction challenge but reduced the minimum term to eight years because of the combat stress disorder he was suffering from. \nDuring his trial, Blackman, who denied murder and was known at that stage as Marine A, said he believed the victim was already dead and he was taking out his anger on a corpse. \nThe appeal judges heard that at the time of the 2011 incident, Blackman was serving with Plymouth-based 42 Commando in Helmand province in “ghastly” conditions which were a “breeding ground” for mental health problems. \nBlackman shot the insurgent, who had been seriously injured in an attack by an Apache helicopter, in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol before quoting a phrase from Shakespeare as the man convulsed and died in front of him. \nHe told him: ‘’There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’’ \nHe then turned to his comrades and said: ‘’Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.’’ \nThe shooting was captured on a camera mounted on the helmet of another Royal Marine. \nHe was “dismissed with disgrace’’ from the Royal Marines after serving with distinction for 15 years, including tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland.
