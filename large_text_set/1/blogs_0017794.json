It looks like that’s what we’re going to find out when Tina Fey’s latest lands on NBC this spring. The trailer for Great News is here , and it is already making us laugh out loud.\nThe premise is quite simply, and also hilarious: Katie (played by Briga Heelan) is a news producer at The Breakdown . Her mom, Carol (played by Andrea Martin), decides to go back to school and learns that she can get credit for getting an internship. Sounds harmless enough, right? You go, mom. Well, that is, until mom is suddenly hired as the show’s intern and she’s running around the studio, hugging the staff, calling everyone “pumpkin” and cracking some great mom one-liners.\nOh, moms.\n\nThere are also some very familiar faces hanging out around the studio, like Nicole Richie (!!) as anchor Portia, and Kimmy Schmidt’s Season 1 boyfriend, Adam Campbell, as the show’s executive producer. OH, and don’t forget SNL’s Horatio Sanz as an editor on the show, and Pitch Perfect’s John Michael Higgins as the other desk anchor. Glad to see Great News is staying firmly in the comedy family.\nAnother fun thing to know is that this show is also semi-autobiographical. While Fey is the executive producer on the show (along with Fey’s long-time producing partner, Robert Carlock), the showrunner is actually Tracey Wigfield , a 30 Rock vet herself — who actually scored an Emmy for 30 Rock once upon a time. Great News loosely follows the story of Wigfield’s OWN mother getting into the television biz, and all the (obvious) hilarity that then ensued.\nA real-life mother-daughter TV duo, that’s now going to make us laugh on TV? Sign us up. Great News premieres April 25th at 9 p.m. on NBC.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:59:05.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
