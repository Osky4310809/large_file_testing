It was said that a No. 4-5 combination of Neil Broom and Henry Nicholls was the weak spot, and that the spinners would have little impact. Finally, it was said that India might not know how to review with the Decision Review System but that New Zealand and South Africa had the technology nailed. \nSo by those standards, or indeed by what most people expected of the first day of the second Test between New Zealand and South Africa in Wellington, Thursday (March 15) was an odd sort of day. Sure, South Africa's pace bowlers reduced New Zealand to 21 for 3, with Williamson falling for just two and Broom going for a duck. But from that point on, the action did not go according to the script at all. \nNicholls counterattacked brilliantly to score his maiden Test hundred, while South Africa's spinners ended up with six wickets - the first time in over 70 years that spin had claimed five or more wickets on the opening day of a Test at the Basin Reserve, and the second-most wickets taken by South African spinners on Day 1 of a Test since readmission. Needless to say, the only time they had taken more was on a dry turner in Mohali in 2015. \nIf those statistics were surprising, throw in the fact that it was JP Duminy who took four wickets and you have one of the stranger days of Test cricket this season. And then you can mention the DRS. Faf du Plessis neglected to review a decision against Tom Latham that was out lbw, wasted a review a few overs later, Williamson reviewed his dismissal only to find that the ball-tracking was not available, and South Africa did not even appeal for a caught-behind against Tim Southee when Snicko showed that he had edged a delivery from Vernon Philander. Southee was on nought, and went on to hit 27. \nAfter the first Test ended in a damp draw, this was the shot in the arm that the series needed, and the real story of the day was Nicholls. Despite coming to the crease in just the 11th over, he shot to fifty in 66 balls. \"They were bowling really well. If you look at the [first] three dismissals, there was some really good new-ball bowling, which is what you get when you come up against one of the best countries in the world,\" he reflected. \"I was trying to be positive and really decisive, and I think that held me in good stead. I just kept looking to score, and when they missed, put them under pressure.\" \nIt was a ploy that worked. Although South Africa managed to string some maidens together, with New Zealand going 24 balls and then 30 balls without scoring as BJ Watling crept to 14 off his first 71 deliveries, Nicholls's positivity in other periods relieved the home side of some pressure. When he went to three figures, taking on a short ball from Kagiso Rabada and finding the boundary, it had taken him just 150 deliveries and New Zealand had reached 200 for 4. In the process, Nicholls buried the bogey of getting out on 98 in a recent Test against Bangladesh. \n\"To come out and play as positively as he did was probably the way to go on that surface where there was a bit in the wicket,\" said Duminy. \"He never backed off at any stage - he always looked to play his shots and be positive. On a wicket like that it's probably the recipe for success. Hopefully we can take something out of that tomorrow.\" \nDuminy would have the final say when Nicholls advanced down the wicket and was bowled for 118. It was a case of the spinner reacting well to the batsman's movement, and in his next over he did it again, firing a wider delivery as Colin de Grandhomme came out of his crease, only to edge to second slip. His third wicket added to the oddness of the day, as Watling under-edged a sweep onto his horizontal back pad, before Quinton de Kock took a legitimate catch behind the wicket. While that suggested that it was just Duminy's day, he insisted that it had been a long time coming. \n\"It's something that I have been working on for a period of time and unfortunately I haven't reaped any rewards, but I guess it comes down to opportunities,\" he said of his bowling. \"If you look at recent Test matches our seam attack coupled with Keshav [Maharaj] have been doing really well. I've been getting an odd over here and there so the opportunities haven't really been there. \n\"When you look at a spinner, it's got to be a big portion of overs that they have to bowl to get success. Today was one of those days when I got an opportunity to carry on. The key is always is to get a wicket in your first three overs to get to keep the ball.\" \nWith Duminy recording career-best figures of 4 for 49, few people knew what to make of the wicket or even the match situation. The consensus from Duminy and Nicholls was that there is movement for the seamers in the first session but thereafter it is anyone's game. After days like Thursday, it seems that which direction the match goes in is anyone's guess. © Cricbuzz TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T12:34:21.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
