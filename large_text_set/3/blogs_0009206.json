FireFin Poké Shop opens its second location on Wednesday, just northeast of the busy Randolph and Wacker intersection. Unlike the original location, located less than a half mile southeast, this location has actual seating. The 1,700 square feet provides enough seats for 50, according to a news release. It may take Loop workers a little time to adjust, as FireFin took over the Perry’s Deli space at 174 N. Franklin St. Perry’s giant deli sandwiches piled with corned beef appeal to a different crowd than the health-conscious group lusting over a Hawaiian fish bowl. Management believes that their culinary star power is what makes them different from competitors. FireFin’s team includes chefs Rodelio Aglibot (The Food Buddha), Frank Fronda, and Shin Thompson, who helms the food at sister spots Furious Spoon ramen and Deadbolt bar. FireFin Poké Shop The group plans to open three more FireFins soon. A Wicker Park location and one inside Ogilvie Transportation Center should open this spring. A Boystown location—neighboring an upcoming Furious Spoon—should open this summer. While the Franklin location will only stay open until 7 p.m., the Wicker Park and Boystown locations will still open until 9 p.m. and be open on weekends. That means more dinners can be poke. But for now, Loop workers will have to be content with a new weekday lunch option. FireFin Poké Shop , 174 N. Franklin St., open 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays. 174 N.
