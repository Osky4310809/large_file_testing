The 38 percent drop from February 2016 figures follows months that saw more crossings than almost any in the last five years.

February saw 45 percent fewer border crossings than in January, when figures had already dropped by more than 24,000 from the October's peak of about 67,000. \nThe drops are sure to hearten of President Donald Trump's supporters, 79 percent of whom said in a July Pew Research Center poll that immigration was \"very important\" to their votes. \nThe Trump administration, which is engaged in battles over health care and a newly issued executive order restricting immigration from six majority Muslim nations, may also reap benefit from what looks like fast action on an issue dear to its base. \n\"The early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact,\" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement. \"We will remain vigilant to respond to any changes in these trends, as numbers of illegal crossings typically increase between March and May.\" \nLast year, monthly crossing totals increased by about 9,000 between March and May. Nikita Biryukov - NBC News \nTrump has made his stance on undocumented immigration clear. Since his inauguration Jan. 20, he has signed executive orders to hire 5,000 new Border Patrol agents and 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents â€” despite having instituted a federal hiring freeze. On Trump's watch, ICE has ratcheted up deportations, continuing a trend that started under President Barack Obama. \nRelated: Washington State Wants Restraining Order Applied to Trump's New Travel Order \nBut the numbers may be misleading or even deceptive, said Mary Giovagnoli, director of the Immigration Policy Center at the American Immigration Council. \n\"It makes me suspicious of the numbers in isolation, and I would really want to look at what was happening at individual points of entry and what the full set of circumstances are on the ground,\" said Giovagnoli, a former attorney for the Department of Homeland Security. \"I think the executive orders haven't even been put into place yet with respect to the various border elements.\" Play", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T04:16:05.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
