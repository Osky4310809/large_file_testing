State IG Catherine Leahy-Scott’s office investigated the matter.\nMeanwhile, Brooklyn federal prosecutors are investigating the financial dealings of former City College President Lisa Coico, who resigned last year after accusations surfaced that she misused research-foundation funds for personal use.\nThe new inquiry is focused on nonprofit aims for the community colleges that accept grant money, as well as rental fees for use of the campuses.\nSources familiar with the probe said the IG’s office also has been flooded with tips about misuse of funds and cronyism at the community colleges.\nAt Kingsborough, questions have been raised about the purchase of vehicles and fees paid to consultants.\nSEE ALSO \nCUNY admin allegedly said there were 'too many Jews' on his staff 0:0 A high-ranking CUNY administrator secretly complained about “too many Jews”... And, as The Post reported last month, Kingsborough also has been rocked by a federal discrimination suit filed by an Orthodox Jewish business professor claiming college brass complained about “too many Jews” on the faculty. Kingsborough/CUNY has denied the allegation. Amid the widening probe, Gov. Cuomo and state lawmakers are in talks to hammer out a state budget for next year, and funding for higher education is a major part of the discussions.\nThe community colleges declined requests for comment.\nCUNY officials said they are cooperating with the IG’s inquiry.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T10:18:37.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
