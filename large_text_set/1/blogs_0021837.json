How to get perfect hair just like on TV (Photo: BBC) \nA member of the production team even donned a green bodysuit to become invisible while flicking the model’s hair with a stick. \n“In order to make sure that my hair is falling in exactly the right place we've persuaded one of the team to don a green suit,” the presenter Helen said. \n“Because he is the same colour as the set he can be removed in post-production when the new background is keyed in.” A man in a green suit helped create the perfect flick (Photo: BBC) \nLastly, the production team used lighting tricks to make hair appear even more shiny. \n“Above we've got these fluorescent tubes which are firing through a trace frame,” the lighting expert said. \n“The trace frame is diffusing it, but it's also making it into a bigger source so this will bring up the area of shine on the top of your head.” Lighting was crucial to create the illusion of high shine (Photo: BBC) \nHe also used a ring light – popular with beauty bloggers – that puts a halo of light around the camera. \n“It hides all the wrinkles or imperfections in the skin. It gets into the eye sockets so you don't have bags under the eyes,” he said. \n“And because the lens is firing through the middle, you will get the reflection of the ring light in your eyes.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T15:12:01.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
