Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nFriday night, Tomi Lahren walked into the Lion’s Den to have it out with Bill Maher and his liberal puppets on “Real Time.” They discussed politics, Trump, racism, and all the usual liberal hot-button buzzword issues. But, the best part came when Jason Kander (a failed candidate for Missouri’s state senate) tried to catch Lahren in a gotcha moment about Benghazi. \nExcept, she got him instead: This Leftist picked a fight with the wrong girl! @TomiLahren SLAMS down a cocky liberal who says Tomi doesn't know Benghazi victims. \n— Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) February 4, 2017 \nPWND! \nI’m not sure if liberals should be more mad about Kander’s mansplaining and misogyny, or, the fact that Tomi Lahren is a conservative AND a woman AND gorgeous AND smart all at the same time. GASP! Either way, Kander revealed what a stooge he is. If you think you’re going to back someone into a corner on Benghazi, pick a different girl. I’m not the one. Trust me. I know all 4 names and honor their service and sacrifice. #TeamTomi #benghazi #RealTime #benghazimatters A video posted by Tomi Lahren (@tomilahren) on Feb 4, 2017 at 1:38pm PST @charliekirk11 @TomiLahren Typical Lib – only argument is to demean or talk over anyone trying to have an adult discourse-sign of stupidity. \n— John T Willett (@RoadHogWarrior) February 4, 2017 @MarkDice @TomiLahren @YouTube The left would be saying this is being condescending to a woman if the parties were reversed!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:43:23.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
