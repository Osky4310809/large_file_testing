Trump said he did not believe in isolationism but that trade policy should be fairer.\nMerkel stressed that Germany was strongly in favor of free trade and open markets.\nFor more on free trade watch Fortune’s video: \nfortune-brightcove videoid=5358483553001]\n“We certainly don’t want any barriers but at a time of an ‘Internet of things’ we want to link our societies with one another and let them deal fairly with one another, and that is what free trade is all about,” she said.\nSpeaking at the same event, Abe said: “Japan, having gone through reaping in abundance the benefits of free trade and investment, wants to be the champion upholding open systems alongside Germany.”\nHe added: “Of course to do so it will be necessary to have rules that are fair and can stand up to democratic appraisal.”\nHe also said the European Union and Japan should soon reach an economic deal. Merkel welcomed his comments, saying: “It’s very, very good that Japan says we want a free trade agreement, we want it soon because that could be the right statement and Germany would love to be a driving force behind this.”\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told Bild am Sonntag newspaper he was pleased that he would be meeting Abe on Tuesday and said the bloc wanted to conclude a free trade deal with Japan this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T06:59:20.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
