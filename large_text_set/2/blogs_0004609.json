I’m sure my partner Shannon Sharpe thinks this game is over. Starting to feel like it. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 Well, that’s it. The Atlanta Falcons are Super Bowl champions. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 Wish the Patriots’ offense had been able to get off the ground the way Gaga did. What an aerial display, unlike Brady’s. She was good. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 What a letdown of a game. Brady’s footballs weren’t deflated but I am. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 \nAs the Patriots mounted the greatest comeback in NFL postseason history, the tone of Bayless’s tweets began to change. Down 21-3. 28-all. Remind you of anything, Cowboy fans? \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 TOM BRADY IS MICHAEL JORDAN. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 Take THAT, Roger Goodell. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 TOM BRADY JUST DID SOMETHING I DID NOT BELIEVE WAS POSSIBLE, EVEN FOR HIM. HE CAME BACK FROM 21-0 DOWN TO WIN THE SUPER BOWL W/O ATL WEAPONS \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 TOM BRADY: GREATEST QUARTERBACK IN NFL HISTORY. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 Just makes me want to puke seeing Goodell shake Brady’s hand. Brady too classy to leave him hanging the way he left Brady hanging. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 YES: Goodell is getting booed out of the stadium. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) February 6, 2017 Brady: ‘WE’RE BRINGING THIS SUCKER (THE LOMBARDI TROPHY) HOME.” HOW SWEET IT IS.
