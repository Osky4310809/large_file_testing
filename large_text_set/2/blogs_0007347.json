You gotta turn this muthafucka up. You gotta come out of that shit.” \nThe post has since been deleted but the original comment claimed she was wearing a hijab — something Drake now disputes. Twitter responded at the time by condemning Drake for what was believed to be an attack on Muslim culture. \n“I make a point every night to end my shows on a time of unity and love so, to find out that I am being utilized in a fake media story about me disrespecting Muslims is devastating to me,” Drake said in a statement on Friday (Feb. 10). “At my show I’m the O2 in London I was talking to 4 women one of whom was wearing a jacket and a winter scarf, I made a comment about taking off the scarf because I enjoy a friendly banter with the fans. I am well aware of what a hijab is and I would never make a disrespectful comment like that in my life towards someone who is wearing one.” \nDrake continued, “I am proud that my closest friends and fans come from all different religions and races, perhaps whoever made up this story should spend more time learning about other cultures and less time trying to divide us.” \nSee his Instagram post with the statement here: TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:50:36.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
