Add Nike’s Mark Parker (CEO, Chairman, and President) to the list. \nParker wrote a letter condemning Trump’s decision, and has pointed to one of their star athletes as an example of how the overwhelmingly negative aspects of the ban will tear apart families of tax-paying citizens of the United States.\nThe letter sheds light specifically on Nike-endorsed Olympian Sir Mo Farah, who recently said, “The Queen made me a knight, Donald Trump made me an alien.” (via The Guardian ). \nFirah is a British Muslim who currently resides in Oregon, and was born in Somalia — one of the countries banned by the recent executive action by the president. Firah is concerned that he may not be able to return home from his current training camp in Ethiopia while this 90-day ban is in place.\nNike is letting the world know that they have Firah’s back.\n\n\nJoining Parker are the CEOs of Google, Facebook, and Apple, who have similarly denounced the ban on immigration . AirBnB’s CEO has gone so far as to offer a place to stay to anyone displaced due to the ban.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T03:25:05.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
