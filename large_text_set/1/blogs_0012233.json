By karthika raveendran | Published: January 13, 2017 11:00 am GV Prakash-Saindhavi reception! \nPongal 2017 just got bigger with Vijay ‘s Bairavaa release. What’s more this film, that also happens to be Ilayathalapathy’s 60th film, was also a soloTamil release this Sankranti. And now the latest reports suggest, the movie has got off to a flying start at the Tamil Nadu box office. Reports suggest, the film has raked in Rs 20 crore gross! Whoa! At the US premiere, the film has managed to collect Rs 5.5 crore. We can expect some record breaking figures in the 4-day Pongal weekend. Even the distributor for Bairavaa took to social media to confirm these reports. The film reportedly has been screen in 53 countries. (Nigeria, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Russia, Kenya, Ghana are few among the many others) Apart from Vijay’s on screen aura and action sequences, no other aspects of the film have received any praised. It’s a typical Tamil, massy entertainer with really nothing new to offer. Only that, Vijaya dn Keerthy Suresh will start together for the first time. Clearly though, the film’s mediocre reviews are not affect its collections at the box office. The film has been directed by Bharathan and also features veteran actor Jagapathi Babu, as the lead antagonist.
