(Photo: Jesse Johnson, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAdrian Peterson might be zeroing in on two contenders for his potential landing spot ahead of free agency. \nThe four-time all-pro running back is most interested in the Seattle Seahawks and Oakland Raiders if he does not return to the Minnesota Vikings, his father told the St. Paul Pioneer Press on Tuesday. \nSeahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell oversaw Peterson and the Vikings' offense from 2006-2010, including the 2009 season in which the running back ran for 2,097 yards. \n“You look at the connections in Seattle, so there’s definitely interest there,” Nelson Peterson told the Pioneer Press . “Those are some pretty good years.” \nMORE COVERAGE: NFL mock draft 3.0: Who's rising after combine? \nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll said at the NFL scouting combine that Thomas Rawls and C.J. Prosise would compete for the starting running back role next season. \nThe Raiders emerged as a team of interest thanks to a strong offensive line that features three Pro Bowl selections in offensive tackle Donald Penn, offensive guard Kelechi Osemele and center Rodney Hudson. Starting running back Latavius Murray is set to hit free agency and might not be re-signed. \nThe Vikings made Peterson an impending free agent last Tuesday when they announced they would not exercise his $18 million contract option. A return remains possible, Peterson's father said, but the Vikings' approach might have created friction. \n“The Vikings should have come back with a number if you truly want him back,’’ Nelson Peterson said. “I listened to (general manager Rick Spielman say at last week’s NFL scouting combine that), ‘We’ll have to see what the market is?’ If you do want him back, give him a number. Is it $9 million? Is it $8 million? That would have made him feel more appreciated.’’ \nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz . \nPHOTOS: Best potential NFL free agents Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:20:56.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
