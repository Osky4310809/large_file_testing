We had to take precautions. We will not allow anyone to tamper with the mortuary,” Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar told the Malay Mail on Wednesday. \nA brigade of heavily-armed special forces soldiers has been deployed to the hospital to keep Jong Nam’s body safe, according to the newspaper.\nBakar said police had identified the would-be burglars, but said there was “no need” to reveal who they are.\nJong Nam – the estranged half- brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un – has been kept at the hospital mortuary while doctors try to determine his exact cause of death.\nSo far, two separate examinations have failed to reveal what killed him, although police believe that he was felled by some type of poison.\nAdditional post-mortem tests were currently underway.\nJong Nam, 45, was attacked by two women in the crowded departure terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13.\nPolice said Tuesday that the highly-trained killers had smeared their bare hands with deadly toxins and wiped them on Jong Nam’s face.\nThe globetrotting playboy suffered a seizure before dying en-route to a local hospital.\nThe murderers fled in a cab, but were later captured along with several other suspects.\nMeanwhile, North Korean diplomats insisted Wednesday that the female killers were “innocent” and should be released immediately, according to Al Jazeera. \nIn a statement, the diplomats asked “how is it possible that these female suspects could still be alive” if they had poison on their hands?\nIn other developments, a North Korean diplomat was wanted for questioning in the case, along with a North Korean airline worker.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:34:37.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
