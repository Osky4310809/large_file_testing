He said all 600,000 farmed ducks in the Landes would be killed and measures would be taken to better secure transport of poultry and limit their mobility. \nThe virus does not transmit via food and is harmless to humans. \nFrance and Hungary have been the countries hardest hit by the highly contagious H5N8 avian flu virus that has been spreading across Europe as well as Middle Eastern countries in the past three months. \nThe government launched a massive cull in early January to contain the virus and said a month ago it would scale back preventive slaughtering after its spread slowed. \nHowever, the number of farms infected has continued to rise with 249 outbreaks detected by February 15. \n  AP and REUTERS) Date created : 2017-02-21", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:45:13.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
