AFP \nLOS ANGELES, United States — Cleveland Cavaliers star Kevin Love is to face six weeks on the sidelines after undergoing surgery on his troublesome left knee, the team said Tuesday. \nLove, 28, underwent a scan on the knee on Sunday after experiencing pain in the joint during Saturday’s 125-109 win over Denver. \nThe team had announced on Monday he would undergo a further assessment. On Tuesday the Cavs confirmed he had gone under the knife to remove a “loose body” from his knee.
