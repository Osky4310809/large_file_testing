Play your saved games on any Xbox One. Microsoft \nAny time you save your progress in a game on the Xbox One, a copy of that save file is automatically saved in cloud storage, too. \nThis means that if you visit a friend's house or buy a new console, all of your latest saves will be instantly accessible as soon as you sign in to your profile! See how much data your console is using. \nIf you're in one of the unfortunate areas of the country currently experiencing caps on home data usage, you're probably trying to keep a closer eye on how much data your gaming habit is eating up. \nIn order to check your Xbox One's data usage, go to Settings —> Network —> Bandwidth Usage. Continue your Xbox 360 games on your new Xbox One. Xbox \nBy now, you probably know that there are over 200 Xbox 360 games that are playable on your Xbox One, but did you know that you can start playing a game on your Xbox One right where you left off on your 360? \nIn order to make your Xbox 360 saves accessible on your Xbox One, you have to enable cloud saving on your Xbox 360. To do so, go to Settings —> System —> Storage —> Cloud Saved Games, and select \"Enable.\" \nNext, start the game on your Xbox 360. When you save your progress, select \"Cloud Saved Games\" as the desired save location. Once the upload is complete, this save file will be accessible when you start the game on your Xbox One! \nAlso, keep in mind that in order to enable cloud saving on your Xbox 360, you must be an Xbox Live Gold member! Use your phone or tablet as a controller. Xbox \nFirst, download the Xbox One SmartGlass app and make sure both your phone and Xbox One are on the same WiFi network. \nThen, select the \"Connect\" icon at the top of the screen and select your Xbox. Not only does this app let you view your screenshots and achievements from your phone, but you can also use your phone as a keyboard instead of trying to type with the controller. Stream Xbox One games to your Windows 10 PC. YouTube/Xbox \nIf someone else is using the TV but you can't wait to play your favorite Xbox One game, don't panic! You can stream your Xbox One game to any PC with Windows 10 on the same WiFi connection. \nFirst, enable streaming on your Xbox One. Go to Settings —> Preferences, and select \"Allow game streaming to other devices\" and then \"Enable the SmartGlass connection from any SmartGlass device.\" \nConnect your Xbox app to the Xbox One using your PC.

The good news is that the Xbox One is compatible with external hard drives, allowing you to quickly increase the total amount of storage. \nTry this 1 TB drive that's on sale for $60 through Amazon. Watch TV with Sling and ditch your cable plan. Sling \nRather than shell out large amounts of money for an expensive cable bundle, you can subscribe to Sling for $20 a month and get 20 channels, including TBS, ESPN, and AMC. They also offer add-on packages for $5 to $15 a month if the channels you want aren't available in the basic package. \nWith Sling, you can also pause and rewind most channels, in addition to having access to many shows for three days after the initial date they aired. Click here for more details. Plug your cable box directly into your Xbox One and make it the home base for all things TV and gaming in your household. YouTube/Xbox \nThis lets you take full advantage of OneGuide, an app on your Xbox One that shows TV listings and lets you pause and rewind shows, just like you would normally on your TV. Except now, everything is one convenient spot — no more HDMI-input-switching when you want to start watching \"X-Files.\" \nClick here for more detailed instructions on how to hook this up. \nAlternatively, if all you get are local channels directly from a coaxial cable plugged into your TV, you can buy this adapter that lets you plug the cable into your Xbox One. In most places, OneGuide is able to pull local TV listings using your zip code. Set any achievement as a background on your home screen. Xbox/YouTube/Bad Brute \nAttached to each in-game achievement is a high-resolution image. Usually, they're somewhat hidden from view, but you can set any of them as your the background on your main dashboard. \nTo do this, double click the Xbox button on your controller, scroll down to Achievements, click the menu button on the Achievement that you want, and click \"Set as background.\" Voila!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T17:36:43.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
