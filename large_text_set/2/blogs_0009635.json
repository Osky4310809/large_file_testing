He arrived the next day at 1am. \nHis checked-in luggage had suspiciously contained several LED lamps, necessitating a thorough check by the staff at Customs which revealed eight gold bars – weighing 100g each – hidden in the lamps’ back panels. \nSo where were the remaining 12 bars stuffed, you ask? Scans with a metal detector revealed their hidden location: the man’s rectum. He has since been detained by airport officials for further probing (ha!) into the case. \nYeah, yeah, we can hear people making noises of disgust already. \nFunnily enough, this isn’t an uncommon practice among smugglers into India — the world's largest gold consumer — as smugglers would normally resort to hiding these metals in their body cavities. So this isn't the authorities first rodeo with unearthing gold from assholes. \nDesperate measures indeed, but these busted attempts really do make for comedy gold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:27:43.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
