In the years since its debut, more than 29 million MagicBands have been produced to unlock the magic of a Disney vacation – from effortless theme-park entry, FastPass+ redemption and Disney PhotoPass association, to skipping the front desk and going directly to your resort room. In fact, MagicBands have been so popular, Disney is now the fourth largest distributor of wearables in the world!\nAnd as technology continues to evolve, so does the MagicBand .\n\nAs you know, we recently launched graphic retail MagicBand 2 in styles ranging from Magic Kingdom 45th Anniversary and Rogue One , to the latest “ Lady and the Tramp ” (just in time for Valentine’s Day). We’re excited to share today that solid-color MagicBand 2 are now available in the current eight colors – pink, blue, red, green, orange, gray, yellow, and purple – wherever MagicBands are sold throughout Walt Disney World Resort.\nAnd if you are a new Passholder or you recently renewed your Pass, you should already be enjoying your new solid-color MagicBand 2 as they are sent to as part of your benefits. Guests who book a Disney resort stay have the opportunity to receive their newly designed, solid-color MagicBand 2 at home.\nWith the MagicBand 2 solid-color bands, you have more options to customize your MagicBand . You can mix and match different-colored bands to create your favorite multi-colored band because with MagicBand 2, the center icon is removable and linked to your My Disney Experience account .\nIn addition to all of the fun you’ll have customizing your solid-color MagicBand , new MagicKeepers accessories are now available that will give you even more options on how to wear the magic. You can put the center icon into a silver carabiner to wear on a purse, diaper bag or belt loop; or into a Mickey Mouse or Minnie Mouse lanyard clip to wear around your neck. Even better, included with each MagicKeeper is a handy mini-screwdriver that helps you change out the icon. And just like with your MagicBand , the MagicKeeper accessories with your icon will work at locations throughout Walt Disney World Resort such as park entry, FastPass+ entrances, Disney PhotoPass association, resort room entry, payment locations and more.\nThere will be additional graphic MagicBand 2s introduced as we expand the launch of this innovative wearable, whether tied into new attractions or new Disney movies. Keep checking back for more updates.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:29:09.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
