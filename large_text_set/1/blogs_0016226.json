He had no idea the suited gentleman was Australian musician , author, screenwriter and all around living legend, Nick Cave.\nHe reached out to Twitter for help identifying the mystery man, but initially didn't get much of a response.\nDoes anyone know who this is? People keep asking him to sign their t shirt pic.twitter.com/Md4fU1uKZD\n— James Malcolm (@DieJamesMalcolm) January 17, 2017\n\"I only had like two replies on that photo — both jokes,\" Malcolm explained to Mashable over Messenger.\nUndeterred, the he decided to just get a selfie with the \"stranger.\" According to Malcolm, Cave seemed happy to be snapped.\n\"He was smiling and chatting to people a little bit — he was bloody loving it IMO,\" Malcolm said.\nCan someone please tell me who this celeb is? Everyone was asking him for pics and I didn't wanna feel left out pic.twitter.com/s67vF5rZKZ\n— James Malcolm (@DieJamesMalcolm) January 17, 2017\nThe response to Malcolm's selfie was swift. Some people reached out to educate the Kiwki, others still to chide him.\n@DieJamesMalcolm @jowrotethis His name is Nick Cave.

Serious question.\n— Mike McGrath-Bryan (@mike_mcgb) January 18, 2017\n@DieJamesMalcolm Cave is an artist, not a 'celeb'.
