Among the presumed contenders is Tom Hardy , who may or may not have just confirmed that he’s in the running by not actually speaking about it. \nREAD MORE: ‘Taboo’ Review: Tom Hardy is a Powder Keg Primed to Explode in Macho FX Miniseries \n“There’s a saying amongst us in the fraternity of acting that if you talk about it you’re automatically out of the race,” he says during an interview with the Daily Beast . “So I can’t possibly comment on that one! If I mention it, it’s gone.” Hardy, whose FX series “Taboo” premiered last week, will next be seen in his “Inception” and “The Dark Knight Rises” director Christopher Nolan’s upcoming World War II film “Dunkirk.” \nUnsurprisingly, he’s of the opinion that Nolan would make a fine addition to the world of 007 himself: “What a fantastic director for a Bond movie,” he continues. “Because Daniel [Craig] is so good, and what [Sam] Mendes and Barbara [Broccoli] have done has been so impressive, that it would be a very hard reimagination to follow after. I wonder what the next installment of that franchise would become, and I think when you mention someone like Christopher Nolan, that’s a very powerful figure to bring into that world who could bring something new and create something profound — again.” \nREAD MORE: James Bond: Daniel Craig Reportedly Offered $150 Million to Return to the Spy Series for Two More Films \nCraig has played Bond in four films now: “Casino Royale,”“Quantum of Solace,”“Skyfall” and “Spectre.” Other names that have been mentioned as possible successors include Idris Elba and Tom Hiddleston. \nThis Article is related to: Film and tagged James Bond , Tom Hardy More From IndieWire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:51:32.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
