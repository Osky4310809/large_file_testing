But then, in a sneak attack, Obama went ahead and awarded Biden with a surprise Presidential Medal of Freedom—the nation’s highest honor—yesterday. The veep immediately became an emotional wreck, reaching for the handkerchief in his back pocket while his friend showered him with dude kudos (or dude-os). “If you can’t admire Joe Biden as a person, you’ve got a problem,” Obama said just before the announcement. “He’s as good a man as God ever created.” \nThe moment was unquestionably inspiring—the last and best in a line of great exchanges between ol’ Joe and Barry. Their camaraderie has been a joy to watch and believe in over the years, and has demonstrated the real value of having a coworker who’s a friend first, and colleague second. \nA Gallup poll found that having close work friendships makes you 50 percent more satisfied with your job, and people with a best office bud are seven times more likely to engage fully in their work. Additional research in the Academy of Management Journal shows that employee loneliness leads to trouble focusing as well as poor communication, suggesting that if Obama didn’t have Biden by his side all this time, the country would be in significantly worse shape. \nWe can only hope the two pals will live out their post-Washington days by road-tripping to Vegas together and summering with each other’s families in the Hamptons. Meanwhile, Donald Trump and Mike Pence better start fashioning their friendship bracelets now, because they have a tough act to follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:46:12.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
