Miller’s witnesses will take the stand when her hearing continues on Feb. 24; her sentence will also be imposed that day.\nIn October 2015, Miller was charged with attempting to hide $775,000 of income from her Lifetime series and its spin-off, Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition , as well as multiple other projects during Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. She allegedly hid the money in secret bank accounts between 2012–13.\nThe reality star, 50, is accused of separating the money into separate plastic bags and having friends carry them in their luggage in August 2014, which is in violation of a law mandating people report if they are bringing more than $10,000 of a foreign currency into the U.S.\n“Throughout this case, Ms. Miller has taken both the allegations and the proceedings very seriously,” Miller’s attorney Robert Ridge previously told PEOPLE in a statement. “This has been a challenging time for Ms. Miller. She appreciates the words of encouragement and support from around the world.”\nI am completely overwhelmed by the amazing response I've received from my search for World Ambassadors!
