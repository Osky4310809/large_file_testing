The two of them are adorable and I think I would be personally affected it they ever decide to part ways. Deepika recently had her first Hollywood release, xXx , and that had her very busy and constantly travelling. Did her schedule put a strain on her relationship with Ranveer? In an interview to Rajeev Masand , she said: \nRomance is the least priority right now out of the many things I like to juggle. Not that it doesn’t feature, it definitely features in the list of things that I need that are very important part of my life… To be in a peaceful relationship, it requires two people to be extremely secure about themselves and be extremely secure about the relationship itself. I think it also comes down to understanding each other’s professions. If some people may not completely understand the time demands or the travel demands and things like that… I think it’s important. You can’t choose that but one can be in a positive space if both partners are understanding of the other person’s demands. \nSo perfect :’)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:53:51.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
