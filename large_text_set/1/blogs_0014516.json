The suspect was to undergo medical checks before being taken to a police headquarters for questioning, the paper said in its online edition. \nDogan news agency published what it said was the first image of the attacker. It showed a bruised, black-haired man in a grey, bloodied shirt being held by his neck. Private NTV television said the gunman had resisted arrest. \nPreviously it was reported that the suspect arrived at the club by taxi, striking at 1:15 in the morning on New Year’s Day. He killed a police officer at the entrance, and barely missed the club’s co-owner, who jumped over a railing, CBS News’ Jonathan Vigliotti reported . \n“When I opened my eyes, he was still there,” said Ali Unal, the co-owner. “I was thinking to jump on him, but he seemed so professional, he had flexibility.” \nInside, the gunman moved methodically, using several ammunition clips, indications he may be an experienced shooter. \nThe gunman left 39 dead and nearly 70 injured in his wake, many of them tourists. \nPolice say he left the club in another taxi, heading to an apartment near the airport only to walk casually away. Investigators searched the apartment but at the time turned up nothing. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
