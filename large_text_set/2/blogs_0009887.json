Hopper said U.S. flight search demand spiked 88 percent in Russia since Trump's inauguration. \"I can't speak to what's causing the interest in Russia, but that increase definitely jumped out at us since search demand is down in so many other countries,\" said Surry. \nAfter analyzing about 3.5 billion price and itinerary searches since New Year's Day, Hopper has found searches of flights to the U.S. are down in 94 out of 122 countries. \nSo far, airlines have not reported a drop in load factors for international flights to and from the United States. However, carriers typically do not characterize traffic flow during a quarter unless there is a major event that prompts a dramatic change in demand.
