Instead, like Gotham , the show will air on FOX. While Black Lightning may not share a network with the Arrow-verse shows, it will retain the creator. \nGreg Berlanti is currently bringing Black Lightnin g to life, so fans have been wondering whether or not he will have any run-ins with the other hit shows. The four CW programs have had multiple crossovers, so can't Black Lightning join the party? \nAccording to Berlanti, you shouldn't hold your breath. “I don’t think so,” Berlanti said. “If we’re lucky enough that that exists, that that show exists, I don’t think those worlds will cross over.” Now, let's break that down. When Supergirl initially aired, Berlanti had very similar comments - we've all seen how that turned out. The caviat, however, is that Supergirl initially aired on CBS. Both The CW and CBS are under the same umbrella, so that was an easy transition. FOX and CBS are competitors, so that kind of crossover is much less likely. This is the same reason Gotham and The Flash are in totally separate universes. \nBlack Lightning will follow Jefferson Pierce, a character who made his choice years ago to hang up his suit and secret identity. However, his hell-bent on justice, star student daughter being recruited into a local gang pulls him back into the vigilante game as the DC Comics hero: Black Lightning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:50:00.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
