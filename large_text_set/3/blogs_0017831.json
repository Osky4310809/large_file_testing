Gomez’s parents themselves are laborers, his mother a janitor, his father a truck driver.\nRAMIRO GOMEZ , Artist: I wouldn’t be here without their labor. I wouldn’t be here without their sacrifice.\nJEFFREY BROWN: Today, Gomez is an up-and-coming artist in Los Angeles featured in galleries and exhibitions for work that captures a life of work by immigrants and others, not typically the subject of art.\nRAMIRO GOMEZ: It’s important for me to highlight these people that are not going to be recorded in our history.\nJEFFREY BROWN: In Denver, Gomez was one of 13 young Mexican-American artists chosen for an exhibition called Mi Tierra, their assignment, to create a new work that explores the idea of home and place in the American West.\nThere were smaller paintings and large installations, videos about the land before Europeans settled here, and a garden that looked like a giant pinata.\nMany of the artists tackled the politically charged topic of immigration. This piece contained an actual panel of the U.S.-Mexico border fence.\nRAMIRO GOMEZ: For me, place becomes a very difficult word to focus on, just because place is never permanent. We’re constantly moving. It’s constantly shifting.\nI’m an American-born child to Mexican immigrants. So, I’m at once Mexican and American. I’m in between. That in-between space, that in-between place that I occupy is something that is constantly changing within myself.\nJEFFREY BROWN: Dmitri Obergfell’s installation reflects an internal identity struggle. He was raised in Colorado by his American mother and was estranged from his Mexican father until recently.\nFor the museum, he recreated a market typical of many Latino neighborhoods in Denver, one that sells T-shirts, sculptures of narco-saints and praying hands with manicured nails.\nDMITRI OBERGFELL , Artist: The reason I wanted to explore this sort of theme in this way using, like, this market is because I have kind of always existed on the perimeter of Latino culture.\nJEFFREY BROWN: You feel complicated when it comes to identity?\nDMITRI OBERGFELL: I think that it would be maybe in bad taste for me to take this opportunity and come into this exhibition and say, OK, I’m fully Latino now. Like, for me, it was just about exploring and having this sort of cathartic process to work through these complicated identity ideas.\nJEFFREY BROWN: Jaime Carrejo is a professor at Rocky Mountain College of Art and a fourth-generation American who grew up in the border city of El Paso, Texas. He created his own border wall with video images of Mexico projected on one side and of the U.S. on the other.\nJAIME CARREJO , Artist: I’m really interested in the construction of divisiveness and how we use that to make people part of a group or exclude them.\nIn making art, you can create complex discussions about complex issues, because things don’t exist in dualities.\nJEFFREY BROWN: That’s interesting, because there is a duality here, right? There’s one country, and there’s another.\nJAIME CARREJO: You have the dualities, but the wall itself, because of the reflective materials, they end up collapsing on each other. There would be moments where the image of Mexico will be transcribed on the image of the United States. You have this whole different landscape.\nSo, you end up with this complex layering and mix of an image, which I think is the perfect metaphor of what it means to be a U.S. citizen of the United States.\nJEFFREY BROWN: Landscape and two worlds colliding was also the focus for Daniela Edburg, who’s lived her life back and forth in both countries.\nHer piece, titled Uprooted, featured a large crocheted root and plant system that weaves together photographs of immigrants and images from the Western terrain.\nDANIELA EDBURG , Artist: I have always had this thing of being, like, of two places.\nJEFFREY BROWN: Literally. I mean, that’s how you grew up.\nDANIELA EDBURG: Yes. That’s how I grew up, you know, with two languages, two points of reference culturally that are similar, but not the same.\nIn my adulthood, I have found it very comforting to find connections between the places through the landscape.\nJEFFREY BROWN: How much are you watching the headlines and reading the news in this context?\nDANIELA EDBURG: Oh, well, of course I’m watching what’s going on. And I — and of course it informs my work. But I am also talking about stepping back and looking at the bigger picture.\nJEFFREY BROWN: The exhibition Mi Tierra shows through October.\nFrom the Denver Art Museum, I’m Jeffrey Brown for the PBS NewsHour.\nThe post Artists illuminate Latino identity and life in the American West appeared first on PBS NewsHour .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:20:09.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
