Adkins told ABC News that her other 19 students are accustomed to PJ logging into the mobile robot from her iPad, and having it move around the classroom. She also does home teaching visits with PJ two days a week to practice new skills face-to-face. \"I think she likes to interact with it,\" Adkins said. \"She likes to know what we're doing and it's a way for her to get more learning time in. Her parents really enjoy it also.\" Trojanowski, a dad of three, said he helps PJ drive the robot around the classroom from the hospital.

The support of the school district has been nothing short of amazing.\" PJ is undergoing chemotherapy and will receive surgery to remove the two tumors at the end of April. The Trojanowskis hope she can rejoin her classmates at the start of first grade. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:33:54.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
