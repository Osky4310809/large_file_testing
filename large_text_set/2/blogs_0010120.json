Could   \nTamara Ecclestone caused uproar on social media last week when she shared a picture of herself breastfeeding her daughter Sophia – who’s nearly three years old. \nBut appearing on Good Morning Britain today, the 32 year old mum said she released the photo to “celebrate” and “normalise” breastfeeding. \nAnd the mum of one admitted that despite criticism that her toddler is too old for breastfeeding, she’s not prepared to stop until she’s ready. \n\"I'll never feel uncomfortable about such a natural act. I'm just trying to do my best,” Tamara told hosts Kate Garraway and Charlotte Hawkins.

Tamara eloquently put her point across (Photo: ITV) \n“I don’t want her sitting on this sofa in twenty or third years time having this discussion and defending her position, when she’s old enough to understand why I did it I know that she’ll believe in me and in the reasons I did it and support me.” \nAnd when asked when she’ll stop nursing her baby, Tamara said: “She’s not going to go to university and still be on my nipple and apparently the natural age of weaning is about four and a half. She might be done before that she might be done around that time but when it’s right for her is when it’s right for me.” \nTamara’s open admission caused a mixed reaction from fans – with some praising the mum of one and others dismissing her as “weird”. \nTalking about the public’s reaction to her social media post, Tamara admitted she was prepared for the fuss. \n“I knew I was going to get a reaction because I have posted pictures breastfeeding before,” she said. \n“But I gave it so much thought and I thought it was something that’s so important and that if I want mums in the future – my daughter one day – to not have so much negativity or people questioning breastfeeding and making such a big deal out of it I thought it was really important for me to go ahead and post it.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:42:51.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
