LG will be officially releasing the G6 at MWC 2017 in just over a month, but this render gives us plenty to talk about in the meantime.\n\nSo what are we looking at here? Well, the top half of a finely sculpted phone viewed from the front. We see a metal frame with nicely beveled edges flowing into a front that looks to have very small bezels. A typical set of sensors and a front-facing camera sit left of a standard speaker â€” nothing too exciting there until we know the exact specs.\nThis thing looks slick, for sure.\nThe display panel itself looks quite interesting, though. Rather than the typical 90-degree corner you see on most phones, the edges of the screen are actually rounded in this render, nearly matching the curve of the phone itself. We already know that the LG G6 will have an interesting (and tall) 18:9 aspect ratio, but there could be a couple more display tricks at play here.\nPrevious renders give us some sort of an idea of what the rest of the G6 will look like, but based on this new photo those old versions may be a tad off from the final design. Thankfully, we don't have to wait too much longer to see it all for real.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:22:17.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
