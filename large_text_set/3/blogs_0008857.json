In his four years with the Vikings, he had a much greater impact as a kick returner than receiver. He scored five touchdowns on returns, including one in 2016, and totaled more than 4,000 yards. \nLast season Patterson showed progress as a receiver, catching 52 passes for 453 yards and two touchdowns. \nHe also ran for four touchdowns as a Viking. \nThe Raiders did not release contract details. \nThe Vikings have been relatively quiet in free agency so far, signing offensive tackles Riley Reiff and Mike Remmers to contracts and letting Matt Kalil , Jeff Locke, Captain Munnerlyn , Audie Cole , Charles Johnson and Rhett Ellison walk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T16:40:29.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
