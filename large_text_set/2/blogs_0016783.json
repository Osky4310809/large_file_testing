(Reuters) \nDays after the abduction and attack on the Malayalam actress, the police have reached no significant development in the case. While they have been able to catch other accused, the grim reality is that the main accused – Pulsar Sunil – has not been caught yet. Until he is caught, there can be no significant break through in this case. Local TV channels have already pointed out that Pulsar Sunil has close connections with the top political brass in the ruling party, which points to the reason why he is still not been nabbed. Two days ago, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had reached out and spoken to the actress, assuring her that the strongest action would be taken to find the guilty. All that remains are words and empty promises. \nThe cops were not even able to nab the prime accused from his residence the other day.

Following this, his legal counsel immediately filed an anticipatory bail plea before the Kerala High Court. The High Court deferred the plea to March 3rd. \nYou may also like to watch this", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:07:30.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
