The protagonist is about to take a huge stride forward, mustering enough courage to say the words he has never uttered before. Then… buffering… \nHow many times has this happened to you? Probably one too many. No one likes the dreaded loading wheel, or interruptions while binge-watching Netflix or YouTube videos. \nYou can verify that your bandwidth is fast enough and your speed is as advertised by using an online speed test. Click here to learn about Fast.com, which is one of the easiest ways to do this . If everything is as it should be with your internet speed, then your Wi-Fi router signal may be the culprit. So, here are three tweaks you can try to speed up your network. Before you begin: \nTo do these tweaks, make sure you can get into your router's administration console. The administration console is where you manage your router's settings and all that good stuff. From password management to firmware updates, this is where the magic happens. It may look intimidating at first but don't worry, as long as you stay within the scope of these tweaks, you'll be fine. Also, it's a good idea to backup your router settings first and save them, just in case. \nGetting to this console is relatively easy. First, make sure your computer is connected (either wired or wirelessly) to your router, then just open a web browser and type in the router's IP address. The IP address is a set of numbers and the default depends on your router's manufacturer. The common ones are 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.2.1. \nIf you're not sure what your IP address is, there's an easy way to check. Just use the Wi-Fi feature on your phone to search for your home Wi-Fi network. Then, tap on the network to see the specific details. (See screenshot below.) \nWhen you type your IP address into the browser, it will prompt you for a username and password. If you have not changed the default credentials (which you should), there is an easy way to change it. Click here to see how it's done . \nOnce logged in, look for a section called \"Wireless Settings\" or \"Advanced Wireless Settings.\" Make sure you are not in the middle of an important activity that requires an Internet connection, though, since these tweaks may interrupt your network connections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:29:44.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
