Ohaneze-Ndigbo \n“By the time he is done, other parts of Nigeria will know the need to fully integrate the Igbos into main stream of Nigerian politics. \n“What he is doing at the moment is to restore the dignity and values of Igbo nation,” he stressed. \nOkeke-Ogene said Ohaneze leadership was working to inspire unity among the Igbos and rekindle the Igbo spirit of ‘be your brothers’ keeper’. \nOn the recent fire outbreak in Onitsha, the president advised Gov. Willie Obiano to start considering the value of lives and property before granting licences for construction of filling stations. \nHe also urged the state government to relocate some petrol stations in densely populated areas of the cities to less populated areas. \nAccording to him, some articulated vehicles that ferry petroleum products are either rickety or unworthy to ply the roads. \n“The state government should deploy the services of vehicle inspection officers to ensure their road worthiness and fitness of the drivers,” he said. \nThe fire outbreak in Onitsha on Feb. 16, was caused by an articulated vehicle which fell inside a filling station and destroyed nearby buildings and vehicles.
