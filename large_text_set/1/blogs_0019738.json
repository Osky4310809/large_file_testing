He is a player of the future who is going to grow a lot.\" \nPSG face a big week with the clash with Bordeaux swiftly followed by the visit of Monaco in Ligue 1, but Emery insisted his side are not thinking about facing the league leaders. \n\"The most important thing is Tuesday - this is the last step towards the final,\" he said. \n\"PSG has won this competition six times and Bordeaux also like the Coupe de la Ligue, winning it three times. They will give all their strength. \n\"We have won it for the last three years and we must work to win all the titles. Our responsibility is to think only of Bordeaux and the players have been made very aware of this.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T16:42:13.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
