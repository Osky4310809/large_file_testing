In an incredible BBC video posted last week, a group of langurs in Rajasthan can be seen mourning the ‘death’ of a robot monkey planted in their midst to observe them.\nIt all begins when one of the langurs drops the robot – which resembles a baby monkey — from its perch on a tree. The troop of langurs believe that the ‘baby’ has died, and they take turns to come and see the corpse.\nIncredibly, they hug and comfort each other, just like we do at funerals – or when we learn of a particularly tragic incident.\nIt all goes to show that monkeys, which are among our closest genetic cousins in the animal kingdom, may be more similar to us than we think.\nYou can watch the video here.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/vaIH5tLmC8U?feature=oembed"], "published": "2017-01-19T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T19:07:13.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
