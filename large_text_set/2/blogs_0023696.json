How much lighter? Well, the carmaker did not disclose any numbers yet but has provided details on the car’s weight saving diet. \nAt first glance, it certainly looks pretty much identical to a regular GT. Look closely, and you’ll notice the gloss-finished carbon-fibre bits on the racing stripes, side mirrors, A-pillar and lower body trim. \nThe bulkhead Gorilla Glass behind the driver is also half the thickness (and lighter) than the one fitted on the standard car, and the acrylic engine cover is no longer held up in place with gas struts. Instead, owners get a carbon-fibre prop for the task, another requirement to lower the car’s weight and centre of gravity. \nOptional weight-reducing equipment available for the standard car – carbon-fibre wheels as well as titanium lug nuts and exhaust – are standard fitments on the Competition Series. Buyers get to choose from six exterior body colours – Shadow Black, Frozen White, Ingot Silver, Liquid Blue, Liquid Grey and Triple Yellow. \nInside, you still get the F1-styled steering wheel, FIA-certified steel roll cage and Alcantara upholstery on the seats, instrument panel and headliner. However, pesky “items not essential to performance” like the air-conditioning system, radio, speakers, stowage bins and cupholders are all omitted because if you want top levels of performance, some sacrifices have to be made. \nThe standard car has a dry weight of the GT of about 1,360 kg but it remains to be seen just how much lighter and faster the Competition Series will be. Power will continue to come from a 3.5 litre EcoBoost V6 that outputs 647 hp and 746 Nm of torque in standard guise.
