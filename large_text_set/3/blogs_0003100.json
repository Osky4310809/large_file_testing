Rapper Azealia Bank s skipped out on a very important court appearance in New York yesterday. She failed to show up in Manhattan Criminal Court Monday, March 6, allegedly playing hooky to attend Paris Fashion Week. According to a statement by her entertainment lawyer, “Azealia Banks mistakenly believed she had a court appearance on March 8th instead of March 6th.” The hearing is related to a 2015 incident at a New York nightclub where she was accused of attacking a female security guard.\n\"Knock knock its the police we have an arrest warrant out for you ms banks\"\nAzealia Banks: pic.twitter.com/OIujkBiahK \n— trent (@trentlilweezy) March 7, 2017 \n\nBanks has been a rather controversial figure in recent rap history.
