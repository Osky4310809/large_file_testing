So we couldn’t help but notice how many celebrities at the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party were wearing shades of green. We are all about ogling and assessing the outrageous red carpet looks that come with awards show season, but the after party is where we get to see people let their hair down and show off their true style.\nThis year some of our favorite actors proved that all that glitters is green , and we’re completely on board.\nWe have to admit, everyone looked like pure money in their green ensembles. 1.

Hopefully next year we’ll see even more stars trying a glamorous take on this earthy color. We think they can pull it off. Now we feel inspired to dig around in our closets for our favorite green number.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:54:21.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
