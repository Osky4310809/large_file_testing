By: FE Online | New Delhi   7:11 PM Akhilesh Yadav said we have to save the country from those whose names are from A and M. (Source: Reuters) \nWhile addressing a rally at Meerut on Saturday afternoon, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at his ‘witty-best’. Targeting the newly formed BJP -Samajwadi party alliance, Modi found a new acronym for S.C.A.M. He said that S stands for Samajwadi, C for Congress , A for Akhilesh and M for Mayawati, drawing huge response from the crowd. \nHis taunts didn’t end here and Modi went on to question the intentions of both the parties saying that Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav are failing to save their own parties so will they be able to save Uttar Pradesh? “Lekin raaton raat gale lag ke kar rahe hain ‘bachao bachao’. Jo khud ko nahi bacha sakte, wo UP ko kya bachayenge? Raaton raat aisa kya ho gaya ki aap unke galey lag gaye?” PM Narendra Modi added on Congress-SP alliance. \nYou may also want to watch: \n\nThese remarks by country’s biggest political leader coming at a public gathering right before the state assembly elections were not just embarrassing for the current Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav but also rankling at the same time. Samajwadi Party has gone through some tough time in the recent past due to the differences between father and son, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav which made a lot of headlines. \nMoreover, BJP has continuously hit the Akhilesh Yadav for its failure to control law and order in the state. In reply to Modi’s comment while addressing an election rally in Auraiya district in UP, Yadav said “We have to save the country from SCAM, we have to save the country from those whose names are from A and M.” \nHe was obviously targeting Narendra Modi and the BJP President Amit Shah but statement showed his exasperation. His response lacked wit, humour, sarcasm and was an attempt to save the embarrassment. As we head towards the election, we must expect more such taunts and comments from both the sides.
