The amount will be deducted from any benefits they already receive. \nThe average private sector income in Finland is 3,500 euros per month, according to official data. \nKangas said the scheme's idea is to abolish the \"disincentive problem\" among the unemployed. \nThe trial aims to discourage people's fears \"of losing out something\", he said, adding that the selected persons would continue to receive the 560 euros even after receiving a job.   \nA jobless person may currently refuse a low-income or short-term job in the fear of having his financial benefits reduced drastically under Finland's generous but complex social security system. \n\"It's highly interesting to see how it makes people behave,\" Kangas said. \"Will this lead them to boldly experiment with different kinds of jobs? Or, as some critics claim, make them lazier with the knowledge of getting a basic income without doing anything?\" \nThe unemployment rate of Finland, a nation of 5.5 million, stood at 8.1 percent in November with some 213,000 people without a job — unchanged from the previous year. \nThe scheme is part of the measures by the center-right government of Prime Minister Juha Sipila to tackle Finland's joblessness problem. \nKangas said the basic income experiment may be expanded later to other low-income groups such as freelancers, small-scale entrepreneurs and part-time workers.
