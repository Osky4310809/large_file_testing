The executive order, issued January 27, halted restricted travel to the US from Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Iran. \nThe Justice Department filed an appeal to the federal appeals court late Saturday to restore Trump's immigration order. On Sunday, an appeal was turned down, prompting the president to lash out against Robart’s decision, claiming that he has put the US at risk. Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 \n“Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!” Trump tweeted on Sunday afternoon. \nIn a second tweet, he added, \"I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!'\" I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 \nAfter the ban was suspended, Trump issued a series of tweets on Saturday, warning that “bad and dangerous people” would take advantage of the move and begin flowing into the US.

And we have a long tradition of that in this country.” \nREAD MORE: US appeals court denies Trump administration’s request to reinstate travel ban \n“The judge’s actions in this case…[are] making decisions about American foreign policy and national security, it’s just very frustrating to the president, to our whole administration, to millions of Americans who want to see judges that will uphold the law and recognize the authority the president of the United States has under the Constitution to manage who comes into this country.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:52:21.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
