This is no BS render or image of a screen protector! This is a real leaked photo of the #Samsung #GalaxyS8 ! đđđ pic.twitter.com/OKUsR7dyXh â Steve Hemmerstoffer (@stagueve) January 19, 2017 \nIf Hemmerstoffer's leak is accurate, it reinforces two of the biggest rumors about the Galaxy S8's design. Those rumors include narrow borders, especially on the top and bottom, and no physical home button. \nBelow is a picture of the Galaxy S7 Edge to compare: \nAntonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider \nThe side edges of the alleged Galaxy S8 don't look much thinner than the Galaxy S7 Edge (above). However, the top and bottom borders are noticeably narrower. Â \nAdditionally, there's no home button to speak of in the leaked Galaxy S8 photo, either. This lines up nicely with rumors that the home button could be embedded into the phone's display, or perhaps under the bottom border, essentially making it invisible.Â \nDespite Hemmerstoffer's reputation as a good source for gadget leaks, nothing is certain until Samsung announces the phone, which we'd normally expect in February during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T23:25:10.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
