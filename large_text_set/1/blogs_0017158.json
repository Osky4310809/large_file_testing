Additionally, the tech giant released a list of smartphones that will eventually get bumped up to the latest version of Android. There are a few of them on this list, including 2015 flagships Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge .\nIf you own a Galaxy S6, you’ll be happy to hear that the device (SM-G920) with Android 7.0 Nougat on board has recently passed the Wi-Fi Alliance certification. This means that the tasty Nougat update is a step closer to launch, although we don’t have a specific time frame as to when it will be released. Despite the certification, it might still take a couple of months before it comes to your device. Hopefully, the company will be able to speed up the process as much as possible.\nSee also: Confirmed: Samsung will not unveil the Galaxy S8 at MWC 2017 4 hours ago The Galaxy S6 Edge is expected to receive the Nougat update roughly around the same time as the Galaxy S6. However, the S6 was the only one that received the certification from the Wi-Fi Alliance so far. If things go as planned, we expect that the S6 Edge will follow suit quite soon.\nThe upcoming Nougat update is a big one and we assume that most users of both smartphones are looking forward to it. It brings a bunch of new and interesting features to the table that will enhance the user experience and make the devices more fun to play around with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T12:50:29.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
