As many as 3,400 employees could lose their jobs in the process.\n“This was always about buying assets out of bankruptcy,” Gildan spokesman Garry Bell told the L.A. Times. “The reality is this wasn’t a purchase of an ongoing concern.” – SF Gate \nA general view of an American Apparel bag, as the US fashion chain are closing 12 UK stores leaving 147 employees redundant.

American Apparel filed for bankruptcy again last November.\nGildan will likely not produce any American Apparel products in California, but could manufacture items in cheaper states.\nIf there’s anything you’ve needed to get from the brand grab it before April.\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:52:36.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
