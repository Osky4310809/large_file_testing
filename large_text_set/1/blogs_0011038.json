Obama’s tribute to Joe Biden was heartfelt and real, as he called his good friend “the best vice president America’s ever had” and a “lion of American history.” With Biden fighting tears in the background, Obama also hit the nail on the head when he said “Folks don’t just feel like they know Joe the politician, they feel like they know the person.” Which is true considering there is no doubt in my mind that Joe Biden would take a keg stand at a rager if he didn’t sign up to be a beacon of professionalism.\nThe most brotastic moment came when Obama joked about the internet gobbling up their 8-year bromance.\nPOTUS calls Biden \"the best vice president America has ever had…this also gives the internet one last chance to talk about our bromance.\" pic.twitter.com/aKNDjNvULx \n— ABC News (@ABC) January 12, 2017 \n\nJoe’s reaction to being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom is moving, regardless of your politics.\nPresident Obama surprises Vice President Biden with nation's highest civilian honor, Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction. pic.twitter.com/GzdqWIMDOs \n— ABC News (@ABC) January 12, 2017 \n\nBiden was granted a chance to speak afterwards and had high praise for Obama as he closes the door on eight years as the leader of the free world.
