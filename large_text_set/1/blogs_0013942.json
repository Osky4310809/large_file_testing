After the game, Anthony gave this very ominous quote to reporters in the locker room.\n\"If they feel like my time in New York is over I guess that’s a conversation we should have,” Anthony told New York Daily News’ Frank Isola. \nAnthony said that in reaction to an article written by Charley Rosen, a former assistant coach and confidant of Knicks team president Phil Jackson. \nIn the piece, Rosen wrote: “The only sure thing is that Carmelo Anthony has outlived his usefulness in New York.” Rosen didn’t specifically claim to have any inside knowledge in the situation, but it doesn’t seem like Anthony thinks it’s just a coincidence.\nAccording to Isola, Anthony went on a “tirade” after the Knicks’ 98-97 loss to the 76ers at the buzzer on Wednesday. He was upset about the team giving up a 10-point lead in the game’s final two minutes, and he was also mad he was frozen out on New York’s final offensive possession in that game. On that play, Kristaps Porzingis airballed a wide-open three-pointer from the right corner that directly led to the Sixers’ fast break that set up T.J. McConnell’s game-winner.\nAnthony signed a near maximum contract with the Knicks in 2014, a five-year deal worth $124 million that included a no-trade clause. The contract has an early termination option after next season, but there has been speculation that Anthony would waive his no-trade clause because the Knicks have failed to put together a competitive team.\nDwyane Wade , a close friend of Anthony, doubts that would happen.\n“He loves it here. He loves being here. His family loves it here. And he wants to win here,” Wade told the New York Daily News last week. “He’s going to be here as long as they want him here — win, lose or draw.”\nAfter the loss to the Knicks, Anthony also said he wasn’t planning on it. However, he is clearly frustrated. And if he’s willing to have a conversation about his future in New York, then perhaps he will consider waiving that no-trade clause and join another team if the Knicks are willing to move on from the Anthony era.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T02:55:15.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
