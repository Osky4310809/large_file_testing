Susan Collins said Wednesday that the Senate inquiry into President Donald Trump’s alleged ties with Russia is a “broad investigation.\" Getty Images \nSen. Susan Collins on Wednesday left open the possibility of issuing a subpoena for President Donald Trump's tax records as lawmakers probe Russia's interference in last year's election. \nThe Maine Republican said the decision of whether to force the president to turn over his financial details would be made by Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr R-N.C., and Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va. as the committee attempts to determine the extent to which the Trump campaign was in contact with Russian officials.

The White House said the president asked for Flynn's resignation because he misled Vice President Mike Pence. \n\"There are law enforcement implications, and we want to make sure that we're doing it right,\" Collins said. \"We're used to probing in-depth in this area.\" \n\"This is a broad investigation, and I am confident that since it is a completely bipartisan investigation with full-time staff, that we will get to the bottom of this,\" she said. \"I will encourage that there be some public hearings as well as the closed hearings that we're doing now, and that we issue a report.\" Gabrielle Levy Political Reporter \nGabrielle Levy covers politics for U.S. News & World Report.
