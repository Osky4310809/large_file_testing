Advertisement \nThis video from COOPH shows what you need to make your little photography studio for small, medium, and large objects. Like any photography it really comes down to controlling the lighting and the backdrop at different scales. At the small end you can make a simple light diffuser with baking paper and simply curl a large piece of paper for a seamless background. You can scale the same basic concept up with larger rolls of paper, and aluminum foil can act as a light reflector in a pinch. \nGoing a bit larger, you might want to make a rudimentary flash diffusers with any thin semi-opaque plastic container fixed on your camera’s flash. Watch the video for more ways you can use household objects to improvise a photography studio of your own.
