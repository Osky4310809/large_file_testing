How can I have a rapport and feel comfortable talking to a 60-year-old white man? \n“Our experiences of life are so different and you’re coming from completely different places.” \nThe report stated: 'Non-white students were comparatively less likely than their peers to be able to access the advantages of cultural familiarity with their tutor. \n\"Some felt it unrealistic to expect their white tutors to be able to empathise with their problems, especially those who had experienced racial abuse in comparable settings in the past. \n\"For non-white students from working-class backgrounds, the gap in life experience was sometimes compounded.\" \nSir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of Buckingham University, told the Sunday Times: “White people can’t teach BME students? Really? \n\"I think this claim is unfair and untrue and disrespectful to universities and members of staff. We are human beings, first, second, third, fourth, fifth.” Read more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T16:03:38.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
