Which Bold Campaigns Promises will Trump Keep?   \nThe spring breakers were called out in an editorial published in The Yucatan Times , which described the collective annoyance felt by others aboard the ship who witnessed the rowdy scene. \nSuly and Anaximandro Amable, a newly married couple, were particularly upset, as the chant was probably the last thing they wanted to hear while on their honeymoon. \nAccording to the editorial, Anaximandro wrote the following statement on social media: \nToday I was with Suly, my wife (who is a native of Mexico), watching an entertainment show off the coast of Cancun aboard a boat, and at the end of the show, a flock of Americans (maybe under the influence of alcohol, or maybe not), began to sing the infamous “ Build that wall ” chant louder and louder. \nIt’s not the first time American kids have started the infamous chant in public to the horror of those around them. After Trump’s win, kids in schools across the nation were caught participating in disturbing chants . Middle school students chant 'build that wall' in Cafeteria   \nThe newspaper noted that several other tourists reportedly complained about the Americans’ behavior, but nothing was done to quiet them. \nThe Yucatan Times editorial went on to note this situation is not an isolated incident, as several tourism sector workers have pointed out that “many Spring Breakers have been offensive, rude and haughty towards Mexican people.” \nWe’re all relatively familiar with American spring breakers and the havoc they tend to wreak on their vacations. \nImmaturity and drunken antics are one thing, but blatant xenophobia and sheer lack of respect for the people whose country you chose to visit are downright unacceptable. \nPlease just know these obnoxious spring breakers do not represent all of us here in America, nor do Trump’s racist policies and promises . Are We Living In A Post-Fact America?   \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:01:28.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
