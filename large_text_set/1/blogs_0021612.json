Her first appearance on the channel will be Monday night on a special with Martha MacCallum.\nHarf has worked most recently as a senior communications adviser to Secretary of State John Kerry. Before that she was a Deputy Spokesperson for the State Department from 2013 to 2015.\nHarf was criticized in early 2015 for her reaction to the killing of 21 Egyptian Christians who were beheaded by ISIS. Harf told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, “We cannot win this war by killing them. We cannot kill our way out of this war. We need in the medium to longer term to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups, whether it’s a lack of opportunity for jobs.” Even Chris Matthews didn’t buy that one. He replied, “We’re not going to be able to stop that in our lifetime or 50 lifetimes.”\nHarf’s comments about ISIS generated a big social media backlash including a mocking hashtag (#JobsforISIS). She was ridiculed by Rush Limbaugh and given a chance to revise and extend her comments on MSNBC, CNN and even Fox News. A few months after this controversy, Harf was passed over for the senior spokesperson position at the State Department in favor of Admiral John Kirby. Here’s the clip:\n\nFox News also announced recently it was dropping several contributors including George Will, Ed Rollins and Stacey Dash.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:02:32.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
