At its height earlier this month, Graham-Cumming said, about 120,000 webpages were leaking information every day.\nSome of this data included \"private messages from major dating sites, full messages from a well-known chat service, online password manager data, frames from adult video sites, hotel bookings\" as well as cookies, passwords and software keys, Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy, who discovered the bug, wrote in a forum on Feb. 19.\nOrmandy also wrote on Twitter that data from ridesharing service Uber [UBER.UL] and cloud password company 1Password had been leaking. Uber declined to comment, while AgileBits, the maker of 1Password, denied in a blog post on Thursday that any personal data had been compromised.\nGraham-Cumming said it was difficult to say which of Cloudflare's six million websites had been affected. He said that Google and Cloudflare had been working together to remove any sensitive data from the store of webpages that search engines like Google collect when they index the web.\nHe said that process was not yet complete, which is why some researchers were still finding data if they knew where to look.\nSome security researchers have said the problem is more serious than Cloudflare has described.\nJonathan Sublett of internet security company Shield Maiden said in a blog post that anyone who accessed sites that used Cloudflare \"should consider their data public and work towards securing their accounts\".\nGraham-Cumming said it was difficult to say which of their customers were affected. \"There will be a debate about how serious this is,\" he said. \"We do not know of anybody who has had a security problem as a result of this.\"\n(Reporting By Jeremy Wagstaff; Editing by Himani Sarkar)\nRead the original article on Reuters .
