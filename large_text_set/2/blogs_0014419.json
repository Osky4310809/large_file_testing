First, there will be 2 speakers on the bottom and 2 up top — 4 speakers total, providing better sound than in days past. Samsung looks to bring USB Type-C to the Tab S3, the new standard after micro-USB that arrived with the now-deceased Galaxy Note 7 last Fall. Nougat will make its appearance here, not surprising considering that Google announced the update with its Pixel and Pixel XL a few months ago. \nThe home button that has been leaked with Samsung’s own press invite can be found here – so yes, despite the move Samsung is making with the Galaxy S8, the Tab S3 will retain the home button/fingerprint sensor setup that graced the Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note 5, and Galaxy Note 7, not to mention the Galaxy S6, S6 edge, S6 edge+, and last year’s Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. \nSecure Folder , Screen off memo, Air command, and the Grace UX found on the most perfect productivity phablet will also make their way here as well. Secure Folder, as you may remember, graced us first on the Galaxy Note 7 before the smartphone’s final recall. As for the S Pen, Samsung has given it an S Pen clip, presumably to allow users to clip it onto the side of the device for safe keeping. Of course, we’d like to see Samsung create a placement slot for it in future models. \nSamsung is set to announce the Galaxy Tab S3 on February 26th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:36:34.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
