Gary, of course, played for us for three years during his playing career, lives in Derby and is passionate about our football club. \n“He is an exemplar of the qualities and values we want in our team and has clearly demonstrated his abilities to get that from his players too.\" Rowett had impressed during stints at Birmingham and Burton (Photo: Getty Images) \nRowett's first match in charge will be the East Midlands derby against rivals Nottingham Forest on Saturday. \n“I’m naturally thrilled to be appointed as the manager of Derby County and can’t wait to get started. \n“I feel that I have a special bond with the club having been here as a player. During that time, we tasted success when we were promoted to the Premier League and moved to Pride Park Stadium under Jim Smith. \n“Living in the local area, I understand the expectation of the fanbase and it goes without saying that Derby County has fantastic and committed supporters. \n“I have coached in the Academy in the past so I know the values of the club and I am looking forward to sharing my experience and knowledge of the league with the staff and players. \n“I am fully aware of the playing squad here and I am looking forward to working with them all first hand.” poll loading Will Gary Rowett be a success at Derby? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T08:58:40.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
