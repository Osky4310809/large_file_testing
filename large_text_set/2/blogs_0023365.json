People are often seen rubbing a dab of sanitizer over their hands to eliminate any germs that may be clinging to their skin. \nHand sanitizers are mostly used when there is no access to soap and water or not enough time to wash thoroughly. \nBut with hand sanitizers, there are two questions that strike the mind. Can a hand sanitizer serve as a suitable alternative to hand washing? Can it eliminate illness-causing germs in situations where using soap and water is inconvenient? \nWhile hand sanitizers do kill germs, it’s important to limit your use of them. Excess use of this hygiene product has certain drawbacks that can cause   \nHere are several reasons to avoid frequent use of hand sanitizers. 1. Harmful Ingredient Triclosan \nIn most commercial hand sanitizers, one common chemical used for its antibacterial properties is triclosan. But it may do much more harm than good . This chemical can contribute to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics. \nAccording to a 2006   journal Microbial Drug Resistance, widespread use of triclosan may pose a potential public health risk of concomitant resistance to clinically important antimicrobials. Another 2014 study published in Frontiers in Microbiology also notes that this chemical is associated with multidrug resistance. \nA 2012   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences notes that triclosan, a high-production-volume chemical used as a bactericide in personal care products, is a priority pollutant of growing concern to human and environmental health. \nThe study found that the chemical can weaken cardiac and skeletal muscle contractility in a manner that may negatively impact muscle health, especially in susceptible populations. 2. Alcohol Poisoning \nEven if hand sanitizers do not contain triclosan, it doesn’t mean that they are completely safe. \nAnother active ingredient in some hand sanitizers is alcohol that acts as an antimicrobial to kill bacteria . \nHand sanitizers that contain about 65 percent ethyl alcohol are harmful to the body when swallowed, either intentionally or unintentionally. Ethyl alcohol has been linked to immune dysfunction and hypersensitivity, which can cause asthma and chronic dermatitis. \nMany hand sanitizers also contain isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), a petrochemical that is a known neurotoxin. 3. Not Effective against Norovirus \nNorovirus, which causes diarrhea and vomiting, is very contagious and can infect anyone. Hand sanitizers are not effective in protecting people from transmission of the norovirus. \n  Applied and Environmental Microbiology reports that despite the promise of alcohol-based sanitizers for the control of pathogen transmission, they are relatively ineffective against the human norovirus. \nThis reinforces the need to develop and evaluate new products against this important group of viruses. \nPlus, a 2011 study published in Canadian Medical Association Journal found that health care providers who used hand sanitizers equally or more than soap and water for routine hand hygiene were 6 times more susceptible to norovirus outbreaks. 4. Does Not Work on Dirty Hands \nAfter using a hand sanitizer, we all think that our hands are clean. But in reality, if your hands are too dirty, hand sanitizers will not remove all the residue or germs. \nThis is one reason why the CDC recommends washing your hands with regular soap and warm water. \n  the Journal of Food Protection reports that antiseptics and wipes are not panaceas for every situation and are less effective in the presence of more than a light soil-load and against most enteric viruses. \nHand sanitizers should be used only when soap and water aren’t available.
