On Tuesday, Entertainment Tonight reported that Carey fired her creative director Anthony Burrell as a direct result of the disastrous performance that aired live on ABC. Per “a source close to Carey,” “part of the reason for Burrell’s departure is due to a placement decision he allegedly made without the approval of Carey or her management team.” The item continues:\nAdvertisement \n\nThe source further explained to ET that Burrell’s decision to move the backup dancers offstage “left Mariah without any support,” as backup singers can be a source of support and help an artist pick up cues if their inner earpieces don’t work and they can’t hear the music.\nThis, like many explanations out of the Carey camp this week, doesn’t quite ring true in my (working) earpiece. The problem during Carey’s performance seemed to come down not to cues and keeping pace with her track, but with an inability to hear her own voice over the crowd, if we believe her disputed assertion that her ear monitor wasn’t working. During her performance of “Emotions,” you can hear her sing a word or two where they belong during the song—at the top of the first verse (“I feel...”), and at the start of the bridge (“Feels like dr—...”):\n\nMariah Carey Melts Down At Times Square New Year's Eve Performance Mariah Carey Melts Down At Times Square New Year&apos;s Eve Performance Mariah Carey Melts Down At Times Square New… A lack of proper lip sync tracks led pop legend Mariah Carey to effectively abandon participation… Read more Read more \nThe performance was bad, but the followup from Carey’s camp, especially via her manager Stella Bulochnikov, has been horrible. Too much has been revealed that just doesn’t add up in the long, detailed explanations Carey’s manager Stella Bulochnikov has given the press regarding her client’s debacle.\nAdvertisement \n\nFor example, Entertainment Weekly asked if Carey had planned to lip-sync parts of her performance and Bulochnikov responded:\nNo. It’s not lip-syncing. Lip-syncing is when people don’t sing at all. This is what people should understand. Every artist sings to a track, especially in circumstances like that when it’s really loud and impossible to have a great musical performance. You’re not singing at the Philharmonic. Every artist who goes out there sings to tracks. What Mariah was doing was singing to tracks. What you heard on the second song, “Emotions,” was her going to sing it live. That’s why you heard no vocals. It’s a song she sings every other day.\nThis explanation only makes sense for “Emotions,” which came via a largely instrumental track (except for canned whistle notes that precede the song’s chorus). “We Belong Together,” which followed, was, per Carey’s own admission onstage that night , “the album version so I’m just going to let you put this skirt on me and sing along with it.” She did sing along for a few lines, as the full studio vocal dominated the sound track, as it was clearly intended to do. Her introductory portion of “Auld Lang Syne” seemed to be entirely lip-synced. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:56:20.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
