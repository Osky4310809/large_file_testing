Anadolu Agency via Getty Images \nGotho reportedly celebrated his birthday alongside his grandson, Suryanto, his wife, Suwarni, and his great-grandchildren Erika Kurniawati and Anisa Kurniawati. \nAccording to The Independent , when asked the secret to his longevity, Gotho said: “The recipe is just patience.” \nHe has outlived all 10 of his siblings, four of his wives and all of his children. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images \nAccording to the MailOnline , the Indonesian records office has confirmed Gotho’s birthdate as 31st December 1870. \nHowever, the paperwork for his Indonesian ID card has yet to be independently verified, so it is currently unclear whether or not he’ll appear in official record books as the world’s oldest person. 10 Tips For Healthy Ageing 10 Tips For Healthy Ageing 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T13:08:43.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
