Last week, Left-affiliated All Inida Students Association (AISA) and the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) backed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) clashed with each other causing injuries to many. \nThe reason of the clash was an invite to JNU students, Umar Khalid, who is facing sedition charge, and Shehla Rashid to address a seminar. The seminar was withdrawn by the college authorities following opposition by the ABVP. A few policemen and journalists were also roughed up during the violence. A Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur has also invited a stir by posting a message against the ABVP on social media. Kaur is the daughter of an Indian Army captain who died in the Kargil war. On her part, she visited the Delhi Commission for Women to complain against abusive ‘rape’ threats on social media from online trolls. \nAlso Watch: \nStudents & teachers from the Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University to hold a march from Khalsa College to Arts Faculty; Gurmehar Kaur to also participate.
