Pentatonix‚Äôs medley cover of La La Land is so perfect that we just might have to go and watch the movie all over again! If you are a fan of Pentatonix and the movie La La Land , then you are in for the biggest treat. We think it‚Äôs time to grab all your friends, even if you can‚Äôt harmonize the key changes, and perform the soundtrack!\nWith over 14 Oscar nominations, including best original soundtrack, La La Land is the it movie of the moment. The song ‚ÄúCity of Stars‚Äù has already taken home a Golden Globe for best original song, and the movie also received best original score, so people are very excited to see what the Oscars brings the cast. So when Pentatonix decided to cover the songs we weren‚Äôt surprised at all.\nScott Hoying and Mitch Grassi, who together are called Superfruit, and fellow Pentatonix singer Kirstin Maldonado teamed up to perform a one-take medley of the songs from the movie. We especially love when Mitch tackles Emma Stone‚Äôs solo.\nClearly we are not the only ones that were super excited about this medley because their fans are freaking out on Twitter!\nLmao I love them ‚ù§Ô∏è!!!
