Justin Amash, R- Michigan told NBC News. \"And, the place may have been more open under [former] Speaker Boehner, sadly.\" (Former Speaker John Boehner left Congress amid criticism from conservatives). \nRepublican complaints about the health care bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have grown since the measure was released Monday. The opposition that started over concern with some of the bills' contents has intensified as Speaker Ryan has rejected calls to make changes to the measure. \nAfter all-night hearings in two key committees, the bill cleared them both Thursday morning and heads to the House Budget Committee next. It will then go to a fourth committee - Rules - before it is brought before the full House for a vote, which could take place in two weeks.

In brief comments Friday before a meeting with GOP committee chairs, Trump emphasized a speedy timeline. \"We must act now to save Americans from the imploding Obamacare disaster,\" he said, adding that 2017 is the year \"it was meant to explode.\" Citing rising premiums, he said, \"as bad as it is now, it will get even worse.\" \nDespite the recent statements and charm offensive though, the president has done as much to hinder Ryan as help him. Trump has indicated to concerned lawmakers, both publicly via Twitter and in private meetings, that he's open to negotiation on the details of the bill. \nThat's made Ryan's job of selling the current legislation to his members tougher and he's taken steps to remind them that parts of the plan have \"actually been a cornerstone of Republican health care proposals all along.\" \nRyan and his leadership allies point out that the drafting of health care legislation has been going on for the past year, and that leadership held many sessions for members to offer their ideas and hear from experts about health care during that time. \nThey point to over 200 hearings over the past seven years and \"hundreds\" of proposals offered. And Ryan notes the legislation is going through \"regular order,\" which means that the committees with jurisdiction are looking at the bill. \nConservatives say their requests to change the measure haven't been accommodated by leadership. \n\"Do I expect all of the issues many of the Freedom Caucus would like would like to have to be in a final bill passage? The answer is no,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., head of the 40-member conservative Freedom Caucus. \"It's about a good-faith negotiation and I think all of our members are willing to do that.\" \nSome conservative concerns revolve around parts of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, that won't be repealed, including the essential benefits package, which is the minimum coverage an insurance plan can provide such as mammograms or maternity care. \nRelated: Here's Why Conservatives Don't Like Their Own Health Care Plan \nRyan says some of conservatives' requests can't be accommodated because of the confines of arcane Senate rules that allow Republicans to bypass the 60-vote threshold and pass instead with a simple majority. \n\"There are only so many things you can do in that bill because of the Senate floor rules for reconciliation,\" Ryan said at a news conference that doubled as a health care power point presentation Thursday. \"You can't put everything you want in that legislation because if you did, it would be filibustered and you couldn't even bring it up for a vote in the Senate.\" \nBut some Republicans are starting to doubt the limitations under reconciliation, saying that it's \"an excuse\" to avoid a more aggressive reform. \n\"Reconciliation is an excuse for not doing something they don't want to do,\" said David McIntosh, the president of Club for Growth, a conservative group that runs funds primary opponents against disappointing Republicans.
