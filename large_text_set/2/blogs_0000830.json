That would indicate a level of premeditated mendacity we haven’t seen yet, even from a government that is becoming more elastic in the application of its principles by the day.\nOpinion polls suggest a plurality of Canadians want changes to the way they elect governments, but there is no agreement on what kind of change.\nA special committee of MPs that studied electoral reform recommended a referendum, pitting the current system against an unspecified form of proportional representation. The Liberals dissented, while the NDP and Green members added a supplementary report that also questioned the need for a referendum.\nThe Liberals’ preferred option was a ranked ballot system that would have kept them in power until one of the prime minister’s progeny was old enough to continue his dynastic rule.\nRelated Andrew Coyne: It's not the Liberals fault for lying about electoral reform, it's yours for believing them Liberals break electoral reform promise less than a day after meeting with opposition for help Most Canadians like current voting system, Liberals’ much-criticized electoral reform survey finds But it quickly became apparent that this was a non-starter without a referendum, which would likely have opted for the status quo in any case.\nSo, I don’t believe the Liberals planned to lie all along.\nBut there is no doubt that they have broken a campaign promise — and not one of the little ones, like creating a more detailed parliamentary expense form.\nAs Mulcair pointed out, the pledge was made 1,813 times. It helped get the Liberals elected and there will be many voters who will never give Trudeau the benefit of the doubt again.\n“How can Canadians believe anything this prime minister says after he so blatantly and intentionally betrayed his own words?” asked Mulcair.\nThe evidence that this was a very bad day indeed for the government was apparent on the glum faces on the Liberal backbench, where many MPs looked as if they’d just been told the government planned to wipe out the Canadian moose.\nOpposition members who spent much of their summer crisscrossing Canada gauging opinion on electoral reform were incandescent.\n“I’m frustrated, angered and saddened,” said NDP democratic reform critic Nathan Cullen, whose mood will be brightened when he sees the next polling report.\nYet, even in his distress, he extended his sympathies to the hapless figure of new Democratic Reform Minister Karina Gould, whose marching orders from the prime minister were released just before she had to deliver the news to Canadians. “Changing the electoral system will not be in your mandate,” the letter said.\nEarlier this month, the Burlington, Ont., MP was elevated to cabinet. In a remarkable act of self-sacrifice, she marched towards the cameras Wednesday to announce her job has become all but redundant.\nShe did passably well defending the indefensible, although she would probably like to erase the clip where she said “MOST of our electoral promises have (been) kept.”\nThe Ekos poll from last November, which suggested a plurality of Canadians believe the current electoral system does not do to a good job of representing what voters want, also tracked trust in government. The poll suggested that trust doubled with Trudeau’s electoral victory, from near historic lows under Stephen Harper.\nBut after this news, confidence and faith in the promises made by this government will crumble.\nTrudeau made clear promises, with no provisos, that have turned to ashes. The new minister blustered that “time and time again we have said there needed to be consensus.”\nBut to suggest this was always the case is nonsense. The caveat about consensus first emerged in an interview given by the accident-prone former minister, Maryam Monsef, last May.\nMonsef was lampooned for claiming to want evidence of “broad buy-in” while rejecting a referendum, because it would exclude young people, women, minorities and people with “exceptionalities,” because they don’t vote in large numbers. Instead, the government would listen to Canadians via Twitter, “the 21st-century way.”\nThere followed the pointless town-hall listening exercise and the asinine mydemocracy.ca online survey.\nThis costly consultation concluded Wednesday with news that, if the Liberals couldn’t get the system that would guarantee them power in perpetuity, they’d stick with the one that delivered them a whopping majority last time.\nFor those of us who prefer strong, stable governments that directly elect MPs to represent their communities, the decision to leave this hornets’ nest unstirred is welcome news.\nBut for those who voted for Trudeau as an antidote to political cynicism — and in the hope that he would overturn what they consider an unjust electoral system — it is nothing short of a betrayal.\n• Email: jivison@nationalpost.com | Twitter: IvisonJ \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:34:53.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
