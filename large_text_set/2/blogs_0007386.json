He sped off, prompting CNB officers to give chase. They got assistance from the traffic police and the car rental firm, both of which sent cars to the scene. \nTogether, they managed to corner the suspect's car on the left-most lane of Lentor Avenue with CNB officers at the rear, TP officers on his right, and the rental car firm's vehicle in front of him. \nUndeterred, the suspect surged into the back of the rental firm's car, crashed into the TP car on the right and reversing right into the CNB vehicle at the rear. Several times. \nThe couple, however, remained trapped, and refused to exit the car. A CNB officer broke a car window and managed to arrest the suspect. His female companion then made a run for it towards a condominium nearby but was nabbed soon after. \nThe violent end to the chase injured a 39-year-old CNB officer, who was conveyed conscious to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital nearby, according to The New Paper .
