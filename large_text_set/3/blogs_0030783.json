There will also be better compensation for delays. \nThe Government is currently announcing full details. \nSouth West Trains is by far the biggest and most important rail franchise in the country. It operates the busiest commuter lines in Europe and has seen passenger numbers double since it became the first rail company to be privatised twenty one years ago. \nThe company is required to run at least 89% of its trains on mainline services on time. But figures for the last month reveal fewer than 87% ran to schedule. \nIt serves all of Hampshire and much of Surrey, Berkshire, Wiltshire and Dorset. \nEvery day 650,000 passengers board a South West Train. That is three times as many vehicles use the entire M25 every day which is our busiest motorway. \nEvery year it brings 100 million people in and out of Waterloo which is by far the busiest station in the country. \nIt has 1,700 trains a day serving 200 stations. \nSWT employ 4,500 staff and is a major employer in the region. \nThe company has been run by Stagecoach who also operate buses all over the country. From August a new joint company made up of First Group and MTR, who own the Hong Kong metro will take over. \n150 new carriages are on order to ease overcrowding allowing a 30% boost in capacity. It is part of an Â£800 million upgrade of the lines into Waterloo.
