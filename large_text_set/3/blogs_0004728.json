Puig, who's almost always dripping in gold, is also a big fan of flaunting it on social media.\n\nSources tell us Puig had tapped a relative to stay in the house while he is away -- but the crooks made their move when that person was away. \nSeems L.A. jewel thieves are having a helluva year -- Alanis Morissette , Derek Fisher and Cesar Millan have all been hit in 2017 and so far, no arrests have been made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:30:20.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
