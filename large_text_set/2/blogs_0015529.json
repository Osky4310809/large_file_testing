By J. Patrick Coolican Star Tribune February 20, 2017 — 4:27pm   The Minnesota House passed a bill legalizing the retail sale of alcohol on Sundays, but forgetful tipplers who currently cannot buy their beer, wine and spirit beverages on the Christian sabbath will have to wait for Senate approval — an outcome still very much in doubt. This is the first time in state history that a legislative chamber has passed a bill overturning the Sunday ban, a law that has been in effect since 1858 statehood and remained in place after Prohibition. Recent elections have seen significant turnover at the Legislature, and among new lawmakers — of both parties — the Sunday ban has increasingly been viewed as an antiquated relic. The House vote of 85-45 is a victory for Speaker Kurt Daudt, who unsuccessfully pushed for an end to the Sunday sales ban in 2015 and 2016. Daudt, who is considered a front-runner for the 2018 Republican nomination for governor, is trying to burnish his policy profile. Ending the Sunday sale ban is a populist issue with which most Minnesotans are familiar, often when they realize they need beer for the Vikings game but have to drive to Wisconsin to get it. Polls have consistently shown a majority of Minnesotans want an end to the Sunday prohibition. Minnesota is one of 12 states that prohibits Sunday sales, and all of Minnesota’s border states allow Sunday sales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:36:19.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
