By Karen Zamora Star Tribune February 17, 2017 — 9:17pm   University of Minnesota police are investigating the latest of several recent incidents involving anti-Semitic postings on the Minneapolis campus. Social media on Friday captured the image of a flier taped to a pole inviting people to the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer. The flier, marked with two swastikas, reads: “White man are you sick and tired of the Jews destroying your country through mass immigration and degeneration ... join us in the struggle for global white supremacy at the Daily Stormer.” University officials said Friday that police are aware of the incident and are investigating. On Thursday, University of Minnesota police arrested a student for allegedly vandalizing a public area of a residence hall with anti-Semitic graffiti. The 18-year-old student from St. Cloud faces a charge of criminal damage to property, according to a police report, and university officials called the case a bias crime. The student allegedly drew a swastika on a desk in a public part of the 17th Avenue Residence Hall, where he lives. The incident, reported to police on Feb. 7, is one of at least seven cases of anti-Semitic graffiti or propaganda reported to the university’s Bias Response and Referral Network since the beginning of December. Last week, another student found a swastika and a picture of a concentration camp drawn on a white board inside his dorm room in Minneapolis. “The University of Minnesota condemns all acts of hate on our campus,” a news release noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:23:27.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
