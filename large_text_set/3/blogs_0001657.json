They do, however, have a little flag so they don’t blindside folks who will inevitably trip over them while looking at their phones. \nThis is basically the ground version of what Amazon wants to do with the sky via airborne drone delivery. \nThis is basically the ground version of what Amazon wants to do with the sky via airborne drone delivery, and Starship Technologies spokesperson Henry Harris-Burland has said his company’s bots also help clean up the air. \n“Big vans — stopping and starting, polluting,” Harris-Burland said. “It’s so inefficient, and our little robots are best optimized for those sort of deliveries.” \nBoth Grubhub and Amazon have sent lawmakers letters of support. \nIt’s unclear where Virginians will first potentially have their feet run over by robot wheels, and cities will be able to further regulate the bots as they see fit. \nLegislators in Idaho and Florida are considering passing the same type of legislation, and the bots are already racing around Redwood City, California and Washington, D.C. \nThe robots are autonomous, though the law requires someone to keep a watchful eye on any bots that are out and about, in case they decide to cross against the light or something, at which point a person can redirect them. \nAutonomous bots are cool, but it’s a shame, really, because it’d be great if one of these operators could mess with her friends. What if an operator got a friend to order something, then, when her friend opened the door to get her package, the operator backed the bot away ever so slowly, so her friend had to lunge at the bot, and then, boom, the bot is rolling down the street while the operator is texting her friend, like, “how bad do you want that wine?” \nWhat I’m saying is I’d like to become one of these operators for a day or two.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T07:19:29.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
