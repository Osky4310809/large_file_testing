However, before taking the dance floor, the new POTUS addressed the crowd, telling the audience that he “respects” that people that didn’t like him very much told him he had done a really good job with the inauguration. \nHe also remarked about how they did something “very special” while praising his running mate, Vice-President Mike Pence. That was followed by a “Make America Great Again!” \nThe couple proceeded to cut a rug to the strains of ‘My Way,’ a song made famous by Frank Sinatra and apparently one of Trump’s very favorites. Pence and his wife Karen then joined in, followed by Trump’s grown children and spouses. The song was sung by Erin Boheme, Nickie Conley and Jason Eskridge . \nWatch the video above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T06:39:59.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
