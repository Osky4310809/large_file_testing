On the other hand, the hosts were constantly pulled through by a gritty Dimuth Karunaratne ton, later to be helped by Dilruwan Perera's steely resilience. \nAs it stands now, Sri Lanka have a lead of 139, and adding a few more could give their wily spinner Rangana Herath enough to make the ball talk and the pitch respond. However, the tourists should know that even something just over 150 is chaseable. \nIt is a big occasion - the final day of Bangladesh's 100th Test. Can they make it count? And for the big occasion, I, Shirshendu Roy , am here to roll out all the updates for you on what should be a 'cliched' but I've to tell you - Super Sunday! \nKeep your thoughts find their way to @Shirsh9 , and see them make their way up here in our LIVE blog. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T06:04:01.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
