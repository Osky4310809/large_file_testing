We now have pricing information on the Q5 and its high-performance SQ5 stablemate , both of which go up a bit in starting cost to reflect new equipment and improved performance. The 2018 Q5, which comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four and all-wheel drive, starts at $42,475, while the V-6–powered SQ5 starts at $55,275. That is a $625 increase over the base 2017 Q5 and $1025 more than the base price of the 2017 SQ5. \n-The Q5 menu includes three trim levels: Premium, Premium Plus, and Prestige. The standard equipment list for the base Premium model is a bit sparse, but it includes a backup camera, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and automatic climate control. Items such as a proximity key, a sunroof, and navigation are optional. Pay $4000 extra for the Premium Plus trim, and you get a panoramic sunroof, LED headlights, and blind-spot monitoring. The Q5 Prestige requires another $5300 and includes Audi’s virtual cockpit TFT instrument cluster, a 360-degree camera system, and a head-up display. The adaptive damping system we lauded on our Q5 first drive is a $1000 option available only on the Q5 Prestige.\n- \n-The SQ5 is a significant step up in performance, with its 354-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and upgraded chassis, so it’s no surprise you’ll pay significantly more for it. It comes only in $55,275 Premium Plus and $59,475 Prestige trims, with options including a $3000 S Sport package and a $500 Cold Weather package.\n- - First Drive: 2018 Audi Q5 - Tested: 2017 Mercedes-AMG GLC43 4MATIC - Audi Q5 Research: Specs, Reviews, and More - -The Q5’s pricing doesn’t deviate far from that of its closest competitors, the BMW X3 and the Mercedes-Benz GLC . In turbo four-cylinder, all-wheel-drive form, the 2017 models of those German crossovers start within a few hundred dollars of the 2018 Q5. Mercedes-Benz’s six-cylinder equivalent to the SQ5, the AMG-fettled GLC43 4MATIC, is $550 more expensive than the Audi, while BMW offers its six-cylinder X3 xDrive35i for significantly less, at $48,945 to start (although the same sorts of performance upgrades are optional as part of the $2700 M Sport and $1400 Dynamic Handling packages).\n-Although Audi hasn’t provided a specific date yet, the company says that both the new Q5 and SQ5 models will be arriving at dealerships this spring.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:47:20.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
