A notable exception is Binky Chadha, the chief global strategist at Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ). Chadha is venturing boldly where no major strategist will go, forecasting the S&P 500 Index (SPX) at 2,600 by the end of this year, according to Bloomberg , a gain of more than 12% from Friday. His is the most bullish of 18 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg last month. Typical V-Shaped Recovery \nGDP growth and S&P 500 earnings growth since the first quarter of 2016 are following a typical V-shaped recovery pattern, Chadha told Bloomberg TV in an interview. He was speaking about recovery from the sharp rise in the value of the U.S. dollar, or dollar shock, that commenced in mid-2014. The dollar shock had the two-pronged negative effect of dampening U.S. exports and reducing the U.S. dollar value of overseas corporate profits booked in other currencies. FindTheCompany | Graphiq 4Q Earnings Better Than They Look \nAdditionally, fourth-quarter earnings were better than they looked, Chadha told Bloomberg. Specifically, he indicated that analysts largely kept their earnings estimates flat, rather than cutting them as earnings release dates approached, which is more typical. This means that the average margin of 3% to 3.5% by which actual earnings beat the estimates is indicative of strong earnings growth, rather than growth from a low base. \nChadha disagrees with observers who see the market as overvalued. Instead, he expects further GDP and earnings growth. He also told Bloomberg that the biggest driver of relative performance will be the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note , which he sees at 3.25% by year-end. The Trump Effect \nWhile most market observers attribute the post-election rally to optimism about stimulus spending and other Trump administration policies, Chadha offered a contrasting view to Bloomberg. His analysis indicates that the market has showed a pattern typical of close presidential elections: months of flat markets before the election, then a sharp rally of 5% or more after the election, followed by another lull. Resolving uncertainties was the main impetus behind the recent rally, he said. Skeptical Voices \nRay Dalio, the founder, chairman and co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates is among those leading money managers who are cautious. In an essay republished by Market Watch , he says that Trump possibly can have a greater impact than Reagan on boosting the U.S. economy. A big concern, Dalio says, is whether the Trump administration will be “aggressive and thoughtful” or “aggressive and reckless” in foreign policy.
