The protesters responded by throwing rocks. \nIt was not clear how many people were injured, but several people were seen being taken away in ambulances. \nThe villagers marched against what they say is a plan to take over private land for the industrial zone in which China will have a major stake. \n\"We are against leasing the lands where people live and do their farming, while there are identified lands for an industrial zone,\" said Chanaka, the district politician. \"When you give away such a vast area of land you can't stop the area becoming a Chinese colony.\" World's tallest Christmas tree unites Sri Lanka \nBuddhist clergy will follow an ancient tradition and issue a decree, asking the government to stop the leasing, said Magama Mahanama, from the Monks' Organization to Protect National Assets. \nHistorically, kings in predominantly Buddhist Sri Lanka are said to have abided by decrees issued by Buddhist monks. \n\"Ninety-nine years means at least two generations. When they [the Chinese] take root here, what's the guarantee that we will have it back? There is a major threat of cultural erosion and demographic change,\" Mahanama said. \nPrime Minister Wickremesinghe, speaking to reporters earlier this week, said the partnership arrangement was necessary to free the country from the debt incurred to build the port. He blamed the debt on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose government was friendly to Beijing.
