Where to even begin? Especially if you're a little clueless as to what to do when you finally get your behind through the doors of your local gym, getting the results can be a real challenge. \nBuzzfeed challenged two average joes (a dude and a girl) two aim high — and we're talking about Chris Evan's Captain America and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow ripped. \nHere's what Evan and Kelsey looked like before their transformation: \nWhat Chris Evan's personal trainer Steve Zim immediately noticed was bad posture, but also the fact that both of them had a great starting point — something definitely to keep in mind when judging the \"after\" pictures. \nWith the help of amino acid and melatonin supplements, they hit the gym. And they hit it hard. \nTrainer Steve got them to not only do rough days of isolated exercises focusing on areas like the glutes and shoulders (in Evan's case), he subjected them to a specific nutritional plan as well. No cheese in salads, and a ton of protein from sources like In-N-Out burger patties and a million Greek yoghurts. The Results \nBoth of them immediately noticed the results. Not only did they have an easier time getting out of bed, they noticed their muscles looked more toned in pictures, and even started enjoying their time at the gym. \nKelsey shredded nine pounds of body weight, and was down over 6% body fat. \nEvan gained four and a half inches in his shoulders, and slimmed over an inch in the waist. Body fat percentage went down over 6% as well. His abs become more pronounced. Is this really achievable? \nThe first thing that should be noted is the fact that both of them were in a pretty good place. An excellent starting point will give you a huge leg up if you're in for a transformation in just 30 days. \nWhat this experiment also showed was the fact that slimming down and getting toned is about hitting the gym, but also paying a lot of attention to what you put into your body. \nSo overall, it's impressive how far both Evan and Kelsey got in just thirty days. But focusing on things like shoulder width and bicep circumference don't necessarily tell the whole story. But in essence, it goes to show that both hard work at the gym and a very focused diet can get you pretty far in just 30 days — depending on your starting-off point of course.
