Assisting the defenses of Taiwan is recognized by the Chinese Foreign Ministry as an extremely delicate situation, and China hopes leaders in Washington \"fully\" understand the \"serious harmfulness\" imposed by selling weapons to Taiwan. © AFP 2017/ Chiang Ying-ying Obama Administration Halted $1B Arms Sale to Taiwan Before Exiting Office \nEnding the deal is crucial for keeping the Taiwan Strait peaceful, Hua noted.

The value of all transfer agreements in 2015 added up to $79.9 billion, the report said, making the US’ $40.2 billion in sales represented market share 50.29%. \nA recent report sent from the Taiwanese ministry of defense to parliament said that Taiwan would respond to invasions by “striking enemy troops at their home bases” and “fighting them at sea,” pointing out that Beijing has never excluded the possibility of entering armed conflict to reclaim Taiwan. \nThe weapons package is thought to consist of parts and equipment accelerating the modernization of Taiwan’s F-16s into F-16Vs as well as defense missiles. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:20:11.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
