That was a brutal homicide committed with determination and ruthlessness. \n“The manner you committed it by your own description, make it a high-level exceptional wickedness that it can only be properly marked by death sentence, which is the only sentence I can pass on you,” Omolaye-Ajileye ruled. \nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the convict was charged with robbery and culpable homicide, contrary to and punishable under Sections 298(a) and 221 (a) of the Penal Code to which he pleaded not guilty. \nAccording to the Police First Information Report, the convict committed the offence sometime in January, 2016 at Kungbani Village in the Kogi Local Government Area. \nHe was said to have robbed Abubakar and his brother, Mohammed of a Toyota Carina E Wagon with registration number Niger: BDA 902 AA and later poisoned, killed and buried them. \nInvestigation by the police, however, led to the discovery of the plot by SARS, culminating in the exhumation of the decomposing bodies of the victims.
