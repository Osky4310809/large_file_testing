He’s got a lovely family – his children and his wife. It’s just a shame. \n“It’s just same old, same old. How he acts doesn’t just affect him, it affects his wife and kids.” Dani Dyer and her father Danny Dyer (Photo: FameFlynet) \nDanny’s daughter Dani, 20, found the woman her father allegedly sexted on Facebook and in direct messages branded her “slag slag slag”, threatening: “If I see you I’ll hurt ya.” \nAnother family member, who did not wish to be named, added: “He’s nothing like people think. \n\"He’s got different values and different attitudes to other members of the family and there’s a long- running rift between some of us.” \nDad-of-three Danny, who met the woman at a book signing, is in South Africa after soap bosses gave him time off from playing pub landlord Mick Carter. \nThey say he has no intention of leaving the show. But another source said: “If quitting the show to give him time to focus on his family is necessary, he will.” \nFriends close to Jo say she is willing to give him another chance if he proves he has kicked his drug and drink demons. \nHe told her he is willing to do whatever it takes to save their relationship.
