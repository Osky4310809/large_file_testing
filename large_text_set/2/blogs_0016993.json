You get engaged in front of a class of fifth graders , of course.\nJason Seifert, a teacher at Harry Russel Elementary School in Ohio, decided to propose to his girlfriend and colleague , Ally Barker. “There is a rumor going around that Ms. Barker and I are dating. So it’s about time we address that,” Seifert told the students as the two teachers stood at the front of the class. The next several minutes of the video included Seifert trying to calm the kids down (using the age-old, iconic “two finger” rule, no less) because there was a lot of screaming after Seifert confirmed that he and Ms. Barker were, in fact, an item .\n\nMuch to Barker’s surprise, however, Seifert wasn’t done there. He got down on one knee to propose, earning a yes from Barker – and even more screaming from a room of very excited children.\nWe’ve definitely met our cuteness quota for the day!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:31:04.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
