His plan is to put all that weight into becoming a professional wrestler and weightlifter. Long Story \nI think we know what happened with the descendants of the great Goliath. \nTwenty-five-year-old Arbab Khizer Hayat is so damn strong he can pull a freaking tractor. \nThink that's sorta meh, check him out pulling two cars with one finger! \nBut Hayat has bigger dreams than pulling heavy vehicles. \n\"I started gaining weight in my teens but I realized that I wanted to get into weightlifting and strongman championships. So I continued to put on weight,\" Hayat said, according to the Mirror . \nHe wants to make it BIG; as big as he is. The real-life Hulk wants to become a pro weightlifter and join World Wrestling Entertainment â€” he just needs to be able to survive more than two minutes in the ring. \nTo reach his lofty goals, Hayat eats a sh*t ton. Every day he consumes 10,000 calories, which is enough for 10 men. His diet is made up of, get this: four whole chickens, 36 eggs and five liters of milk. Presumably, he takes down a crap load more. \nSure, Hayat is getting a lot of press now, but if he really wants to make it big, here's an idea. Go one on one with Iranian Hulk Sajad Gharibi . That would be way more entertaining than Floyd sh -mayweather or Conor Mc- sh -Megor. I'd put my money on the Iranian, though. He looks way more agile, despite his tiny 340-pound frame. Own The Conversation \nDoes he have the endurance to compete in the WWE? Drop This Fact \nAt 6-foot-eight and 430 pounds, American Brian Shaw is technically the world's strongest man after winning the 2016 competition.
