Once you’re home for the night, do you really want to take a trip back outside to head to the gym? \nSo chances are, you’re not logging in as many weekly workouts as you were before it got so cold. And even if you do make an effort to hit the gym regularly, you’re probably spending more time inside when you’re not working out. Think of all the time you spend in the summer walking your dog or just strolling along sightseeing. All that movement adds up to more daily activity, meaning you were burning a lot more calories then than you are when you’re just killing time with nightly Netflix binges, Raglin explains. \nPlus, when you’re cooped up indoors in front of your TV, you’re at greater risk of mindless snacking, says Men’s Health nutrition advisor Alan Aragan, M.S. \nAnd you’re probably choosing junk: In fact, one Portuguese study found that people who watched more than 120 minutes of TV per day—just one after-work flick—were significantly ate more fat and less fruits and vegetables, he adds. \nSo go outside, even if it’s just for a little bit, suggests Raglin. Try making a pact with a buddy to hold each other accountable. Take a quick walk once a day during lunch, shovel each other’s driveway, or even start doing a winter sport together (these three winter sports are our favorite). It’s a simple way to incorporate more daily activity and boost your energy levels, Raglin says. 2/5 Emily McCarthy Cause of Winter Weight Gain: You Can’t Resist Party Food \nFrom Super Bowl parties to extravagant Valentine’s Day dinners, food-based holidays are no less tempting after you ring in the New Year. And even if you try to watch what you’re eating throughout the week, you might completely veer off course once a weekend full of parties hits, says board-certified sports dietitian Marie Spano, R.D., C.S.C.S. \nThat’s a problem: Your calorie intake needs to be balanced throughout the week if you want to maintain or lose weight, she says. So constantly treating yourself on these special occasions can do more damage than you think—especially if you’re still carrying a few extra pounds from Thanksgiving through Christmas. \nBut you don’t want to be a buzz kill and stay home either, so you probably will find yourself surrounded by tables full of all kinds of delicious snacks. The bad news is, most of these are going to be loaded with empty calories, she says. \nPlus, research suggests that you tend to down more food when you’re around lots of people, says Aragon, which can lead to eating more than you would otherwise. \nYour best bet is to plan ahead for these gatherings—but don’t worry, we’re not going to tell you to eat at home first. (Where’s the fun in that?) What you should do, though, is to fill your plate accordingly. Load up on foods rich in fiber , like fruits and vegetables, and protein , like deviled eggs or colds cuts like turkey and ham. This trick will help you stay fuller longer, so you’re not tempted to hit up the dessert table for seconds when you’re done. 3/5 Emily McCarthy Cause Of Winter Weight Gain: You Reach For Comfort Food \nNot only is winter depressing, it can spike your stress levels, too, says Richard Weil, M.Ed., the director of the weight loss program at the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center. You’re constantly running late because you have scrape ice off your car, your energy bills have skyrocketed, and your winter cold can cause work to pile up. \nSo you might turn to food for comfort, he says. Past research from the University of Florida suggests that consuming salt can actually decrease the amount of stress hormones , like cortisol, in the brain. Plus, your oxytocin levels—the feel-good hormone associated with pleasure and comfort—spike. Sugar can have a similar effect, too. So it’s no surprise that many of the foods we reach for when we’re stressed are calorie bombs. \nYour move? Give in to your comfort-food craving—within reason. Having a little of it once in a while can actually help you avoid binging on those foods later, says Keri Gans, R.D., author of The Small Change Diet . \nJust make sure it doesn’t make up a bulk of your plate, she says. Aim to eat a balanced meal: protein should take center stage, supplemented with one side of vegetables and one side of your favorite comfort food. 4/5 Emily McCarthy Cause of Winter Weight Gain: Your Mood Takes a Hit \nAs the days become shorter and darker, you might feel more depressed , explains Weil. It’s called seasonal affective disorder, and it’s characterized by the fatigue, irritability, and depressed mood you might feel during the winter months. \nAnd that’s bad news for your gut: When you feel depressed, anxious, or irritable, you tend to make up for it by eating more, says Weil. And research shows that you may tend to reach for more sugary, starchy foods too, which are often higher in calories. \nIf food doesn’t help you feel better, you might turn to booze to boost your mood even more, he says. That can mean a load of extra calories—for instance, just two cans of beer can cost you an extra 220 calories. If you do that daily, you could be taking in 1,530 extra calories each week. Plus, research suggests drinking alcohol can mess with your cravings and actually cause you to eat more high-fat, savory foods more than you would.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:32:21.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
