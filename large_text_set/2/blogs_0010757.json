There were 14 total counts of criminal conduct filed by the Centre County district attorney’s office in central Pennsylvania, according to The Associated Press. \nPolice are specifically accusing Jeffrey of trying to obtain naked photos of a then-16-year-old girl, while also seeking oral sex from the same girl’s then-15-year old sister in 2013. \nThe official legal complaint says Jeffrey told the alleged victim through text messages that “it’s not weird because he studied medicine,” but that she still shouldn’t “show these texts to anyone,” reports TheAP. \nThe alleged victims’ father reportedly handed over electronic communications showing Sandusky asking for nude photos of the underage girls. \nThe younger Sandusky is a corrections officer at Rockview State Prison near the State College, the home of the Pennsylvania State University’s main campus. The state Corrections Department said that Sandusky was suspended without pay Monday. \nFather, Jerry Sandusky, is currently serving a lengthy prison sentence of 30 to 60 years, after conviction for being a serial child molester.
