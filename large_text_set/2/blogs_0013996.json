The twin wristbands he’s showing off this week at the New York Toy Fair, called BeatMoovz by Dmet Products, are the product of that dual love affair.\nInside each soft-rubber BeatMoovz wristband is a Bluetooth radio and an accelerometer. Every time Kusunoki moved his wrists, a nearby JBL speaker emitted a beat. Each band is connected to the BeatMoovz app, which has a library of 400 different sounds. Wearers can assign different sounds or instruments to each band.\nI watched as Kusunoki and a colleague danced, moved their hands sharply and kicked their feet (they were wearing BeatMoovz bands on their ankles, as well) and music played simultaneously from the speaker, which was connected to their iPhone and the BeatMoovz app via a Bluetooth connection.\nThey moved so quickly that, at first, I could barely tell that the sounds were perfectly synced with their hand movements. The effect was enhanced when Kusunoki started doing the robot and subtly jerked his wrists so that cool robotic sounds accompanied each move.\nRepresentatives from Cra-Z-Art, the company distributing BeatMoovz in the U.S., told me there is zero delay between movements and the sounds. Those sounds can include beats, various instruments, audio clips, sound effects (like Karate fight sounds) and custom sounds. BeatMoovz owners can also download new sound clips via the app.\nBeatMoovz ships this August for $59.99 (for two wristbands).\nBONUS: Invisible liquid can make your phone screen as hard as sapphire", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/8qLfMuLN.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/8qLfMuLN.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/042Xjraw.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/042Xjraw.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-20T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:24:00.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
