I know, if we can’t trust this keytar-playing, golden spikes-wearing queen, who can we trust? REX/Shutterstock \nThe “jump” itself was pre-recorded — Gaga was only suspended by a safety wire about halfway up. \nThe show began with Gaga standing on the roof with wind blowing her hair as she sang “God Bless America” and “This Land is Your Land” with 300 Intel drones creating the US flag in red, white and blue in the sky. \nThen, it looked like she leapt from the roof. \nBut only viewers at home saw this. In the stadium, people thought the show began with Gaga hanging from the wires in the dark.

Natalie Cheung, the general manager for Intel Drones, said, \nThere’s a lot of weather and environment (issues)… \nThis makes me believe Lady Gaga is one of the most badass professionals in the world and would 100 perfect do it live if she were allowed to. \nAll this is on top of giving an incredibly high-energy performance for 13 minutes.

We’d hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it’s raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show. So our creative team as well as the Super Bowl creative team felt this would be best to be filmed. \nFrom a logistics and creative perspective, it’s a bit hard for her [Lady Gaga] to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium. \nLADY GAGA CAN DO ANYTHING. \nWhether your team won or loss, we can all agree Lady Gaga was the best part of last night.
