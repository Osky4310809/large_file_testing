Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSo it turns out that Chinese Super League clubs aren't trying to sign absolutely EVERYBODY after all. \nWhile plenty of players continue to be linked with moves to the world's fastest-growing league, it seems as though the clubs themselves are only too happy to shoot down some rumours. \nOr at least Shandong Luneng are. \nBecause when the club from Jinan in Eastern China - the current home of former Premier League players Graziano Pelle and Papiss Cisse - were linked with a move for Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas , they responded brilliantly. Pelle is already raking it in in China (Photo: Getty Images) But Cesc won't be joining him (Photo: PA) \nWith Fabregas having become a bit-part player at Chelsea this season, it was suggested that he could move to the team managed by the ex-Fulham boss Felix Magath. But then it wasn't. \n\"Yikes! What a super competent agent we have,\" the club wrote on their Weibo account after the link. \"But Fabregas is not our cup of tea. \n\"Please, for God's sake do not spread the fake news. Shandong Luneng will not buy another foreign player this season. Our coaching staff have already made elaborate arrangements for our foreign players. They're just not that into you, Cesc (Photo: Clive Mason) \n\"In the meantime, we will remain committed to producing home-grown talents for the Luneng academy. How about bringing up our own Fabregas?\" \nThat's pretty conclusive, then. Should Cesc Fabregas be starting for Chelsea? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:35:50.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
