Having gone on sale in 2013, the facelifted SUV’s arrival coincides with the 60th anniversary of the brand’s presence in Thailand. \nOn its outside, the revised MU-X sports new bumpers front and rear, along with LED headlamps and tail lights. In front, an updated grille marks the ladder-frame SUV’s visual change, while rolling stock now comprises 18-inch alloy wheels, up from the 17-inch items on the pre-facelift. A roof-mounted spoiler rounds up the exterior aesthetic updates. \nPowerplants for the facelifted MU-X are made up of the 150 hp/350 Nm 1.9 litre turbodiesel and the 177 hp/380 Nm 3.0 litre turbodiesel , which also reside in the engine bays of the updated D-Max. The 1.9 litre unit is enlisted solely for 2WD duty in the updated MU-X, with the choice of either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic gearbox. The 3.0 litre is mated to a 4WD setup and a six-speed automatic transmission with hill descent control. \nInside, much of the architecture remains the same, albeit with updated cabin appointments: new soft-touch plastics have been introduced, as have wood-look trim inserts, while an eight-inch iConnect smartphone-capable infotainment unit sits atop the familiar circular HVAC control cluster from before. \nThe two-tier glove compartment, dashboard storage, and air-con vent-cooled cupholders are also carried over from the MU-X/D-Max front cabin. Meanwhile , the leather upholstery for the seats pictured here appear to use a revised trim pattern. The revised Isuzu MU-X goes on sale in Thailand from 1.09 million baht (RM138,532), with six variants making up the range.
