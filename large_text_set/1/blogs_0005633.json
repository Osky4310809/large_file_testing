Well, hello there! Earth and the Moon viewed from Mars, November 2016 – https://t.co/GAM6RP0xZf pic.twitter.com/gRUJtNj1Lj — HiRISE (NASA) (@HiRISE) January 6, 2017 \nNASA admitted the moon was brightened significantly before compositing the image, as it is actually much darker and would be barely visible at the same brightness scale as Earth. \nHowever, the image does reflect “ the correct sizes and positions of the two bodies relative to each other ”. For scale, Earth’s could fit about 30 times in the distance between it and the moon. \nREAD MORE: Breathtaking photos of Mars from deep space high-res camera \nIn the image, Earth appears in shades of green, blue and red (due to vegetation). Australia is the reddish image in the middle of Earth, Southeast Asia is the reddish area near the top, and Antarctica is the bright section down the bottom-left. The other bright spots are clouds. \nHiRise and the five other instruments on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have been observing Mars since 2006.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:41:15.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
