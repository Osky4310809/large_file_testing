When we started working on this target, the figures that were circulating in the press, they were what? €40m, €50m?” Dimitri Payet attempts a free-kick (Photo: AFP) \nPayet was part of the Marseille side thrashed 5-1 by PSG on Sunday night. \nThe French champions led 2-0 at half-time after goals from Marquinhos and Edinson Cavani.
