But while John Carpenter's 1978 film about some faceless, knife-wielding maniac was pivotal in bringing forth the 4-year onslaught of movies featuring faceless, knife-wielding maniacs, Halloween was not the film that gave birth to the 1980s film movement known as the slasher. In this excellent video essay by The Film Theorists , we get the discover the true origin story of everybody's favorite horror subgenre, starting with the film that inspired it, Black Christmas . \nNow to start, let's get this right. Black Christmas is not a slasher film. It predates what many consider to be the first slasher, Halloween (1978), by four years, but many of its tropes, like premarital sex, deadly phone calls, and a faceless killer, were borrowed (some would say ripped off) by the films that would eventually make up the slasher subgenre. \nThis video essay offers a very important study, namely because if you look into what inspires a film movement, often what you find is that some relatively unknown filmmaker decided to take a risk and make a film that doesn't entirely follow convention, which then opens the doors for others to walk through and more safely make something similar. As the video says, director Bob Clark made a film that you tend to find right before the start of a film movement: it's ahead of its time, it dared to be different, it challenged convention, and unfortunately wasn't appreciated until much later. \nThe lesson here, other than knowing the true origin of the slasher subgenre, is that being different and taking risks can pay off in the end. I mean, you may never benefit from your decision to draw outside the lines, but you may make it a whole lot easier for others to do so—you know, until one day those lines expand and the color within them becomes the norm. Kind of sad and dark, but hey, we're talking about horror, so whatever. 'Black Christmas' (1974) \nDo you agree with the video essay? Did Black Christmas really usher in the age of the slasher?
