By: FE Online  18 AM Jusitce CS Karnan. (ANI) \nHistory is in the making today as an unprecedented contempt case has been heard against a sitting judge of a High Court by the Supreme Court. This is the first time that a sitting High Court judge has raised complaints citing the provisions of the SC/ST (Atrocities Act) and registered criminal cases against CJI, other companion judges and the Attorney General of India. Such a development is unheard of in the history of the Indian judiciary till date. \nIt is doubtful whether such developments would happen even in movies that showcase courtroom battle – such is the dramatic sequence of events surrounding CS Karnan’s actions as a sitting High Court judge. \nAccording to reports, CS Karnan told SC today, “My fight is not against the judiciary, I am fighting corruption. If the court allows, I can prove my case.” \nJustice CS Karnan further pushed his case before the Supreme Court saying, “Allow me to start my judicial work.” \nJustice Dipak Misra asked CS Karnan to offer an unconditional apology or go ahead with the allegations – the choice is entire Karnan’s. \nWatch this also: \nControversies are not new to Justice CS Karnan. For instance, he reportedly barged into the courtroom of another Judge at Madras High Court, and accused him of caste-based discrimination. The said judge was a Brahmin from Kashmir and CS Karnan, a Dalit from Tamil Nadu. \nFollowing this controversy, Justice CS Karnan was transferred to Calcutta High Court but things went from bad to worse thereafter, which led to an unprecedented situation that the nation is witnessing today. \nJudges have no protection against contempt of court, says Senior Advocate Narinder Hooda \nThe Supreme Court had earlier issued bailable arrest warrants which Justice CS Karnan refused to accept and he categorically stated that he cannot be proceeded against under the Contempt of Court Act because he is a High Court judge. He went so far as to order criminal cases to be registered against the CJI, other judges on the Bench in the said matter and Mukul Rohatgi, the Attorney General of India.
