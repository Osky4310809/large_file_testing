Her fate was sealed from birth. Some are chosen to create brilliant work, and the rest of us are screwed.” \nWhat you conveniently dismiss from such interviews — if they’re included at all — are the stories of the hours, days, weeks, months, and years of silent practice that the writer has put in. \nSomewhere, back there, a decision was made. \nOn a particular day, at a particular hour, that writer had said, “This is the thing I will dedicate my working life to.” \nSometimes — as in Holmes’s case — there are obvious hints regarding what that “thing” is. Most times, there are none. \nThe first step on the road to mastery is making a conscious decision about what you will decide to master . \nDo not wait for it. Decide. Focus, focus, focus \nOur society tells us from youth that we should become “well-rounded” individuals. \nIf you want to master your craft, ignore that advice. \nSherlock Holmes focused intensely on a narrow set of criminological skills and subjects that ultimately made him an incomparable detective. \nHe studied specific disciplines within botany and chemistry — only to the point that they served his needs as a detective. \nHe learned the science of cryptography in order to swiftly crack the codes of master criminal communication. \nHe became competent enough in human anatomy to forge the early stages of what would become actual forensic analysis in murder investigations. \nHe would lie down napping, smoking, and thinking for hours about one minute aspect of a case, not moving until an idea — and sometimes a complete solution — came to him. \nThink deeply about the core demands of your craft . \nWhat is needed to advance in mastery of it? \nWhat can be ignored as mere distraction? \nPractice brutal focus. \nOur fictional detective’s methods are studied even now by very real, working detectives everywhere, because he had the discipline to stay within the arena of his expertise. \nNote: For those familiar with Holmes’s methods … No, I am not advocating the use of morphine and/or cocaine. Become an idiot \nIdiocy is the other side of the coin of mastery. \nIn order to focus your working life on mastering your craft, you’ve got to rule out a lot of the trivia that takes up most people’s time. \nSherlock Holmes could determine what part of the city you’d been recently walking through, from a quick glance at the type of mud on your boot. \nHe was a strikingly horrible violin player. \nWithin moments of meeting, he could tell you where you were born, what you’d eaten for lunch, if your brother was an alcoholic, and if you’d served in the war (and where). \nHe knew nothing about current events or the politics of his day. \nHe could seemingly predict the future, arriving at correct conclusions that left witnesses believing he was an other-worldly being. \nHe was utterly oblivious to the basic astronomical patterns of the stars and planets. \nHolmes accomplished his amazing ability to see the obvious by … becoming an idiot. \nHolmes’s greatness — and ours — is largely defined by what we do not know. \nHe had one driving professional goal — to engage and best the greatest (and lowest) criminals in the world. He shut out the rest, and he did not care if anyone regarded him as less than “well-rounded.” \nAll of his considerable mental power was directed at the “elementary” practice of deduction and the few peripheral disciplines that supported it. Distraction pulls us in all directions \nThe boredom of repetition drives us to other interests. The pressures of culture make us worry we are missing out on something “important” if we dedicate ourselves to our pursuit of mastery. \nStop. \nIf you want to master writing, you are giving up running the 800 meters in the Olympic Games. \nIf you want to master the cello, you are giving up the ability to talk about what’s good on television these days. \nIf you want to master anything, you must become an idiot about nearly everything else. \nOddly, you must become an idiot in order to become a genius. Continue to obsess \nThis path of mastery is not for everyone, but I believe it is one of the great callings and joys this life has to offer. \nYou’ll never get all the way there … nobody does. \nThere is only so much time in one day, only so many days in one life. \nAs our immortal Victorian detective (and the extraordinary man who wrote him into existence) has shown, mastery is one way to truly change the world. \nChoose. Focus. Become an idiot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:57:49.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
