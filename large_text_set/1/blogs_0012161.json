They’re already selling merch branded with the phrase. \nThere are t-shirts, bumper stickers, and even an actual garbage can. \nThe whole online shop got a bit of a makeover and has a splash header announcing their Trumpian rebranding: \nTrump prides himself on being a savvy businessman, so surely even he would be impressed by this quick profit-seeking turnaround. \nUPDATE — 5:07 p.m. EST: \nIt has been brought to our attention that the proceeds from this are now going directly to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which is the same organization Meryl Streep encouraged donations to during her Golden Globes speech. \nThat doesn’t appear to have been the case earlier, but a bullet point on the e-commerce page now reads as follows: All proceeds from purchases of BuzzFeed’s limited-edition “Failing Pile of Garbage” merchandise will go to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
