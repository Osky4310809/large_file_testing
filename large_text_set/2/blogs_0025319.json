She will take her baby to medical appointments and other activities to socialize her son.\nLast month, two other board members were split on whether Ellard should be granted the ETAs, leading to a second hearing Monday to resolve the same issue.\nEllard assured the board that she didn’t get pregnant on purpose and was not trying to use her child to get special privileges.\nLast month, Ellard told the parole board that her baby has completely changed her outlook, making her feel more confident and giving her hope for the future.\nShe wept when she talked about the baby boy, whom she described only as her child.\nRelated Kelly Ellard , B.C. woman convicted of killing 14-year-old girl in 1997, denied parole ‘A lot of goodwill’: How to make life normal for babies raised in prison Boyfriend of killer Kelly Ellard , now pregnant in jail, is suspect in drug dealer’s disappearance: documents The baby is living with Ellard at the Fraser Valley Institution annex where she’s serving a life sentence for murdering Virk almost 20 years ago.\n“I can’t even talk about this baby without crying,” Ellard said, breaking down and wiping her eyes. “It’s been very therapeutic so far, very calming … It’s very motivating for me. It’s the best therapy for me.”\nEllard was convicted of second-degree murder for brutally beating and drowning Virk under a Victoria bridge when both were just teens.\nEllard had requested the board grant her up to five escorted temporary absences from prison each month, so she could take the baby to medical appointments and socialize him in the community.\nHandout Reena Virk. One parole board member said last month that she had concerns about Ellard’s relationship with the baby’s father, a criminal who had his parole revoked last August.\nHe wasn’t named at the hearing, but Postmedia earlier confirmed his identity as Darwin Dorozan, a gang associate.\nEllard said her “partner” had been doing well on parole, working two jobs, staying away from drugs and inspiring her to live better.\nShe said she doesn’t know all the details about why he was sent back to prison because they now have limited contact.\n“What happened was very disappointing to me,” Ellard said. “I don’t have the level of confidence I once had.”\nEllard spent the first part of the hearing recalling the night she and other teens attacked and killed Virk under the Craigflower Bridge in November 1997.\nShe admitted she threw the first punch that night and later rolled a bloodied and unconscious Virk towards the water, where she drowned.\n“I had lit the lighter by her face. She didn’t look the way she did when she was walking away,” Ellard said, adding there was blood in Virk’s eyes. “Her hair was stuck to her face. It was something you don’t forget.”\nShe denied the version of events presented in court by her co-accused Warren Glowatski, who said Ellard held Virk’s head under the water.\n“I asked Warren to help me bring her to the water and splash water on her face,” Ellard said Wednesday.\nShe said she wanted to see if Virk would “wake up.”\nAsked about her thoughts that night, Ellard said she was fearful of getting caught and going to jail when she realized how seriously Virk was hurt.\n“I had kind of gone on autopilot at that point,” she said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:02:54.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
