The onscreen couple was spotted today while giving interviews to the media and let me tell you they looked really cute together. Both Yami and Hrithik were casually dressed but looked really cool in their outfits. Yami chose to wear a tube top paired with ripped jeans and black pumps. Doesn’t she look gorgeous? Donning a maroon coloured sweatshirt and blue denims, Hrithik looked smart too. Don’t you think these two make an adorable pair? We wonder why didn’t they star in a movie much before this.. \nThe songs of their forthcoming movie Kaabil have already won a million hearts. Not just that, if the movie posters and trailers are anything to go by, Hrithik Roshan’s Kaabil has HIT written all over it. But the main question is who will win at the box office. Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees of Hrithik’s Kaabil? Yes, both the films are gonna be releasing together and its gonna be a box office war. While on one hand we have SRK and Mahira Khan’s intense romance in Raees, we have Hrithik and Yami’s cute love story in Kaabil. Let’s see which film manages to rack in more money. (ALSO READ: Kaabil new promo: Hrithik Roshan surprises Yami Gautam by mimicking Amitabh Bachchan perfectly – watch video) \nHrithik and Yami, who will play Rohan and Supriya in the film are leaving no stone unturned to promote Kaabil on all platforms. Both the actors are not only good looking, but also very talented. They have been paired together for the first time and in fact, this is also Yami’s first big break in Bollywood. Kaabil has already become a profitable venture and the makers seem to have an edge over Shah Rukh Khan‘s Raees. So looks like everything is pretty positive for team Kaabil right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T18:06:17.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
