But that didn’t stop tens of thousands of people gathering in central London at the weekend for the Unite for Europe march , calling for Britain to remain in the EU. \nThe march went from Park Lane to Parliament, finishing with a rally in Parliament Square. Speakers included Alistair Campbell, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, Labour MP David Lammy and Green co-leader Jonathan Bartley. Before the speeches were made, there was a minute’s silence to honour the victims of the Westminster attack. \nSimilar events took place in Edinburgh and Madrid in solidarity with the London march. \nSee some pictures from the protest: Mar 26, 2017 at 10:37am PDT \nMar 26, 2017 at 8:20am PDT \nMar 26, 2017 at 4:13am PDT \nMar 26, 2017 at 4:12am PDT \nMar 26, 2017 at 3:45am PDT \nMar 26, 2017 at 2:13pm PDT \nMar 26, 2017 at 3:16am PDT \nMar 26, 2017 at 1:35am PDT \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:06:04.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
