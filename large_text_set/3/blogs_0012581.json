In fact, a recent survey suggests that burnout accounts for about half of employee attrition. Dan Schawbel, over at Quartz, explains that while companies are reporting record profits, employees are working harder than ever, and it’s taking a toll on both their morale and their overall well-being. \nThat makes sense. The traditional 9-to-5 workplace has all but disappeared, and thanks to technology, employers can—and often expect to—connect with their employees literally 24 hours a day, which often leads to people working on the weekends or during vacations. And telecommuting, which is often touted as a flexible way to allow employees to better juggle work and life, hasn’t helped. It might even hurt: Research has shown that people who sometimes work remotely end up working later hours at night and on the weekends when doing so in order to basically prove how dedicated they are to their jobs. Schawbel also points out that between 2000 and 2014, employee productivity increased by 21 percent but wages and benefits only went up by 1.8 percent. In other words, people are doing more and more at work but without being compensated for it.
