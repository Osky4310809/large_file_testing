Officers say drivers were doing donuts, burning out and racing during the sideshow.\nPredictably, with all that noise, the group was soon reported to police and officers swarmed the scene.\nIt appears dozens of drivers were then cited.\nThe sideshow got the attention of police. (Credit: Patterson Police Services)\n“Remember if you come from out of town to commit crime in Patterson we will find you!” Patterson Police Services wrote in a Facebook post on the incident.\nIn total, 48 tickets were given out. Police also say they towed one car and even made one arrest.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:50:02.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
