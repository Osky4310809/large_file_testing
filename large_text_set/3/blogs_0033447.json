Opposition angered \nThe Syrian opposition, whose cooperation will be needed in any negotiated solution, reacted furiously to the US shift in stance. \n\"The opposition will never accept any role for Bashar al-Assad at any phase,\" said Monzer Makhos, a spokesman for the High Negotiations Committee, which represents the opposition in negotiations over Syria's war. Rex Tillerson visits Turkey amid Syria tensions \n\"There will be no change in our position,\" he warned. \nUnder Barack Obama's administration, the US made Assad's departure a key goal, but new president Donald Trump has put the accent on defeating the Islamic State of Iraq of the Levant group, known as ISIL or ISIS. \n\"Our priority is to really look at how do we get things done? Who do we need to work with to really make a difference for the people in Syria,\" Haley said. \n\"We can't necessarily focus on Assad the way the previous administration maybe did. Do we think he's a hindrance? Yes,\" she said. \n\"Are we going to sit there and focus on getting him out? No.\" \nPreviously, the United States has stuck by a UN-backed peace plan that would see Assad \"transition\" from office while an interim government is formed. \nTillerson is due in Moscow next month for talks with Russian leaders, and Trump has long argued the powers should work together against ISIL. \nUS-backed forces are closing in on the group's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, laying the groundwork for an assault on the city. \nNumerous diplomatic efforts have failed to end the Syrian conflict, which has killed more than 320,000 people and displaced millions since it erupted in 2011. \nA fifth round of UN-sponsored peace talks is taking place in Geneva but no breakthrough has been reported and they are scheduled to end on Friday.
