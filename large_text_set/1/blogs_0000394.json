TCL will still release BlackBerry-branded handsets, for which the former telecom giant will build the Android software.\nAccording to previous rumors, the new keyboarded 'Mercury' will feature an unusual 1620x1080 pixel resolution with a 420 ppi pixel density, which works out to a 4.63-inch display size. There's also expected to be a Snapdragon processor of some sort (perhaps the 625), 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of internal storage.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:27:50.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
