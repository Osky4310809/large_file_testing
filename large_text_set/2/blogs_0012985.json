Therefore, the Leonov is legally in international waters. \nThis is not the first time the Leonov has been spotted close to the United States coast. \nIn April 2015, the Leonov was seen near the coast of Mayport, Fla., the home of the U.S. Naval Station. Advertisement - story continues below \nThere have been other instances in the past of Russian ships entering waters near the United States. \nIn June 2016, the Russian spy ship Pribaltika was spotted near the coast of Hawaii while the U.S. Navy was participating in a Rim of the Pacific exercise. \nAt that time, U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesperson Lt. Clint Ramsden told U.S. Naval Institute News, “The ship’s presence has not affected the conduct of the exercise and we’ve taken all precautions necessary to protect our critical information.” \nWhile the reason for the ship’s close proximity is a mystery, the ship is equipped with SIGINT, which allows for the interception of signals and communications.
