The Chelsea star worked with Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge and the Special One is reportedly keen on a reunion with the Brazilian. \nJose Mourinho is confident Real Madrid will not embark on another 'dirty tricks' campaign to sign David De Gea. Bernabeu president Florentino Perez claimed someone at Manchester United is “messing around” with keeper De Gea, with his European champions poised to make a fresh move after failing to land the player 18 months ago. Other news stories from Saturday's Mirror \nAngry Mark Hughes has accused Tony Pulis of branding Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross a “loser” as he stoked their row with West Brom over Saido Berahino. Potters manager Hughes claims Baggies counterpart Pulis left a voicemail for Shawcross hitting back at the defender’s accusation that Albion had leaked news of their ex-striker Berahino’s drug ban following his January move to Stoke. The warring Welshmen are refusing to let the dispute die after failing to shake hands before or after the game between their teams at The Hawthorns last week, which West Brom won 1-0.

Boss Allardyce has brought in Lee Richardson, a former player, coach and Chesterfield manager who he worked with previously at West Ham. Big Sam is a big believer in sports psychologists, and reckons Richardson can help rid his players of the \"fear\" that grips them when they play at their Selhurst Park home. \nCrystal Palace's lucky eagle mascot has been absent from recent home matches due to bird flu fears. Palace's form has plummeted since American bald eagle Kayla stopped showing up at games, with the Selhurst Park club languishing in 19th position in the Premier League. Fans have been wondering about Kayla's whereabouts but it has now been revealed that her absence is related to avian flu.
