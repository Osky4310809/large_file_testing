Animation and DC Entertainment ‘s have brought online a new Justice League Dark movie clip. This one sees Bruce Wayne repeatedly confronted by the name Constantine. Check it out in the player below! \nThe Justice League Dark movie begins when innocent civilians start to commit unthinkable crimes across Metropolis, Gotham City and beyond. In response, Batman must call upon mystical counterparts to eradicate this demonic threat to the planet. Enter Justice League Dark, reluctantly led by the Hellblazer himself, John Constantine. Like Batman, Constantine is a cunning, often cynical loner who is the best at his chosen profession – but quickly realizes the sinister forces plaguing the planet will require help from other supernatural alliances. Forming a new “league” with sorceress Zatanna, otherworldly Deadman, and Jason Blood and his powerful alter ego Etrigan the Demon, this team of Dark Arts specialists must unravel the mystery of Earth’s supernatural plague and contend with the rising, powerful villainous forces behind the siege – before it’s too late for all of mankind. \nActor Matt Ryan returns to the role of John Constantine in animated form alongside Jason O’Mara as Batman, Camilla Luddington as Zatanna, Nicholas Turturro as Deadman, Ray Chase as Jason Blood/Etrigan, Roger R. Cross as John Stewart/Swamp Thing, Jeremy Davies as Ritchie Simpson, Rosario Dawson as Wonder Woman, Jerry O’Connell as Superman, Enrico Colantoni as Felix Faust, and Alfred Molina as Destiny. \nThe Justice League Dark movie will debut on Digital HD on January 24, 2017 and on Blu-ray Deluxe Giftset, Blu-ray Combo Pack and DVD on February 7, 2017.
