(Photo: BPI) \nOnly five English clubs have now reached the competition's quarter-finals in the past six years. \nAnd it is little wonder when you defend as badly as City did here in Monaco. \nThey were more Sunday League than Champions League as they failed to heed the warnings of that eight-goal slugfest of a first leg. \nBoss Guardiola should have been experienced enough - this was, after all, his 100th game in European competition - to tighten up his defence so City stood a chance against the highest scorers in Europe. \nInstead, he went for broke, admitting it was “the only way he knows” how to play and sent out a team with two full-backs, one centre-half, a makeshift centre-half and just one defensive midfielder. Guardiola screams instructions to John Stones — the only true centre-back in his team (Photo: Getty) Kevin De Bruyne and co trudge off knowing they have only the FA Cup still to play for (Photo: Getty) \nThat is either naive or just reckless. \nNeedless to say, City were taken apart. \nLeonardo Jardim has built a brilliant team with Kylian Mbappe’s pace and power up front, Bernardo Silva pulled the strings from midfield and Benjamin Mendy almost ran the game from left-back. \nCity were awful. Simply awful. \nThey lost this match in the first half when they failed to get a grip on the game. Their half-hearted fightback in the second half was too little, too late. \nIncredibly, City flirted with going through for six minutes - from the 71st to 77th minute - when Leroy Sane scored to put them ahead on aggregate. Mbappe gave Monaco the early lead — though they could have scored even sooner (Photo: Reuters) The hosts were so dominant it was surprising they didn't score again before Fabinho on the half-hour (Photo: Reuters) \nBut they were nowhere near strong enough to hold on, while that first half was so one-sided that if the visitors had ended up going through it would have been daylight robbery. \nIt almost feels the narrow exit, on away goals after a 6-6 aggregate draw, only serves to paper over the cracks because, on this evidence, Guardiola needs a complete rebuild in defence and also in midfield. \nBut even their attack was powder-puff because Sergio Aguero, normally City’s most reliable and prolific striker, missed three big second-half chances. \nYou can only go all-out attack if your team actually try to attack and, for long periods, there was a complete breakdown between midfield and the forward line. Sane's goal briefly put City 6-5 ahead on aggregate...   ..but Tiemoue Bakayoko got the winner that Monaco deserved (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nFrom the very start, Monaco were far too good. \nTheir pace and movement dragged Guardiola’s defence all over the place, with Aleksandar Kolarov looking every inch the makeshift centre-half. \nMonaco fully deserved to go ahead after eight minutes when Mendy’s cross was blocked by John Stones, Silva put the ball in again and Mbappe fired home. \nThe only surprise was that it took them until the 29th minute to get a second —Mendy’s cross was turned in by Fabinho and suddenly City were heading out. There was no silver lining to Wednesday's match for Guardiola (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nFinally, the Blues began to show signs of life after the break. \nAguero missed a sitter, saw Andrea Riggi clear another off his toe and was then denied by keeper Daniel Subasic. But City were at least building up a head of steam. \nThen they made a breakthrough after 71 minutes. \nKevin De Bruyne’s long diagonal pass reminded us he was actually on the pitch, Raheem Sterling’s shot was parried by Subasic and Sane put in the rebound. \nTheir joy and hope was short-lived though, largely because of their shocking marking. Swashbuckling Monaco have now scored a stunning 126 times this season   \nThomas Lemar’s free-kick picked out Tiemoue Bakayoko who was unmarked and his brilliant header flew into the far corner. \nThat was their 126th goal this season. And it's still March! \nMonaco celebrated wildly at the final whistle, they are arguably the best team to watch in Europe and are exactly what City were hoping for when Guardiola took charge last summer. \nAnd they have done it on a fraction of the budget.
