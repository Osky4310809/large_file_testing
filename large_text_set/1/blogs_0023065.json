In culinary school, I’d save money with food to buy better knives, then I was like I’m spending so much on knives, I should be making these,” he said. “I was trading up and selling them constantly to switch things out and into my collection.” Bonner is a graduate of the New England Culinary Institute but insists, “I don’t do anything frou-frou. I’m into rustic and traditional European food. I like doing a twist on the peasant version of something. I still cook with a Crock Pot at home.” As a professional chef, Bonner has worked as executive chef and instructor most recently for Viking Culinary School and Chaumette Vineyards & Winery. He was a knife skills instructor (of course) while he cultivated NHB Knifeworks business. +5 \nA chef and slicer knife from NHB KnifeWorks. Laurie Skrivan • lskrivan@post-dispatch.com \nWorld’s oldest tool • “The first thing people did was pick up something to cut and scratch and fabricate with,” Bonner said. “There are natural sharp shapes formed by nature,” he said of rock shards that became prized caveman trophies. “We just figured out how to put a handle on it. And that’s the part that fascinates me because that’s the part that connects you to the knife.” +5 Handout \nSpecial sauce • Handles are Bonner’s specialty. A $379, stainless steel chef knife with a figured maple wood handle embellished with black, gold, red and white resin was featured in a blog post for Vogue magazine noting that it “makes slicing and dicing an elegant affair.” But Bonner has also done wonders with treating his metal blades. He uses a concoction of mustard, hot sauce and salt to form mesmerizing lines of waves, mosaics and erratic formations that appear as if they were crafted with designer metal blades. “It took some practice to get the formula right. I kind of paint it on using a coral sponge. You have to time it just right and get the mustard ratio just right.” \nSafety first and always • “I have a lot of respect for knives. You have to,” Bonner said of safety precautions. “I probably cut myself on them daily.” He said it just comes with the trade. “The worst was when I got a knife in the leg. I was trying to disassemble it and it slipped out of the vise and shot into my leg. But, still, I didn’t need stitches.” Then he casually mentions that a paring knife once “stuck me pretty good ... and I had a small piece of metal cut my neck once. That was close and really scary, but I do have lots and lots of safety precautions, really.” And he said, not to brag but his knife skills are pretty impressive.
