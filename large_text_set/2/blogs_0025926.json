By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 28, 2017 1:56 PM Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had started his party’s campaign for Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017 from Pichladi Kritpura village in Rudrapur constituency of Deora district. \nCongress vice president Rahul Gandhi had started his party’s campaign for Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017 from Pichladi Kritpura village in Rudrapur constituency of Deora district. However, the villagers are still unsure about casting their votes in favour of incumbent Congress MLA from Rudrapur seat Akhilesh Pratap Singh. Rahul Gandhi had initiated the door-to-door campaign and will be hoping to yield optimum results, according to The Indian Express story. The village, which was chosen for Rahul Gandhi’s programme due to its tilt towards Congress, seems to be torn between BJP and Congress, the report says. The general opinion in the village is that they have traditionally voted for Congress but believe Narendra Modi is doing some good work. Apart from this, they say PM Modi’s much-debated demonetisation has not affected them much, the story says. \nThe dilemma, however, indicates that the intensity of the contest in eastern UP, a stronghold of SP. The BSP too is in the fray. Deoria district has seven seats, of which five are held by SP and one each are with BJP and Congress. Rudrapur is the only one where Congress is contesting; it has renominated MLA Akhilesh Pratap Singh. BJP has renominated Jai Prakash Nishad, who lost the last three elections he contested. Singh expressed confidence that he is sure of winning. A few opine that the Congress MLA has done good work while others want Modi to be “given a chance”. \nWatch this video \nThe Nishad community is in a majority in Rudrapur. With BJP and BSP candidates fielding candidates from that community, Congress believes there will a split in their votes. BJP, however, says Nishads are with them. The constituency has a significant number of Yadavs and Muslims, the traditional SP votebank, which Congress hopes will transfer to it. \nThe high-octane campaigning for the Phase 6 of Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017 has begun. The polling for the sixth phase of the elections will take place on March 4. 49 assembly constituencies spanning across 7 districts will go to polls.Meanwhile, an estimated 57.36 per cent of 1.81 crore electorate yesterday cast their votes amid tight security during the fifth phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh with Amethi and Faizabad assembly seats remaining the centre of attention. The day-long poll process remained largely peaceful in 51 Assembly constituencies spread over 11 districts of the state. “57.36 per cent polling was recorded till 5 PM and the figure is likely to go up as several voters waited in queues to exercise their franchise,” UP Chief Electoral Officer T Venkatesh said. Notably, the first four phases of UP polls this time saw voter turnouts of 64 per cent, 65 per cent, 61.16 per cent and 61 per cent respectively. \n(With agency inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:59:57.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
