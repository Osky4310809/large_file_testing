There is no boundaries, no social class, no religious group. It’s a problem and that’s why we’re here, to make people aware,\" he said. \nNational experts in neurobiology, psychology and investigation will train the department's trafficking investigators in Forensic Experiential Trauma Interview, or FETI, techniques to \"teach the NYPD how to interview trafficking victims in ways that help us build and collect evidence for cases without further harming them,\" O'Neill said. \nThe police department is also working \"closer than ever with nonprofits in the field to make sure victims get the services they need as quickly as possible,\" O'Neill said, as he was joined by Lori Cohen, the director of an anti-trafficking initiative run by Sanctuary for Families, the largest provider of services for such victims in New York state. \nCohen praised the NYPD's new approach. \n\"By developing strategies that target those who buy and sell sex rather than those who are bought and sold, the NYPD is shutting off the economic engine that drives commercial sexual exploitation,\" she said. \nCohen was accompanied to the presser by a woman named Carmen, whose last name was not released for her own safety. \nCarmen was kidnapped in Mexico when she was 14 and trafficked to the United States at 15 and forced into sex work, Cohen said. \nShe escaped when she was 20 and \"saw her trafficker sentenced at 23,\" Cohen said. \nCohen indicated that recent executive orders by President Donald Trump on sanctuary cities and immigration may strengthen the tactics that traffickers use to control victims. \n\"Traffickers use not only force or fraud to control their victims, but also fear,\" she said. \"Fear of arrest if the victims tries to flee, fear of deportation if she tried to report her abuse to law enforcement, fear of being punished rather than helped for seeking freedom. \n\"Today’s announcement has a particular resonance for immigrant victims of trafficking who wish to gain their freedom,\" she added. \"If you seek help you will not be arrested or deported. New York remains a sanctuary city.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:50:03.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
