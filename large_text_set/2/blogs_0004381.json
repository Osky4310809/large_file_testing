A new terror attack list issued by the White House ignores attacks by white Christian terrorists. \nPresident Donald Trump is angry because he believes the media is ignoring terrorism. On Monday, the Trump White House released a list of 78 terror attacks carried out in the US and abroad since 2014. \nThe list is notable for two reasons: One, it is filled with embarrassing spelling mistakes ; and two, the only attacks listed are attacks committed by Muslims. \nThe White House claims the terror attacks on the list were mostly “under-reported.” However, multiple media outlets and other objective observers note that the attacks were not under-reported, and also note that Trump’s claim that the media conspired to ignore such attacks is simply false. \nCommenting on the list, Mark Follman, writing for Mother Jones , reports: \nAs the media picks apart the White House’s absurd suggestion that attacks in Paris, San Bernardino, Orlando, and elsewhere were somehow ignored, the bigger story may be this: Trump has been almost entirely silent about terror plotted and carried out by white supremacists and other far-right extremists. \nFollman is correct. The White House list ignores terror attacks committed by anyone who is not a Muslim. \nFor example, Dylann Roof , an avowed white supremacist, and a church-going Christian, killed nine people at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston in June 2015. As previously noted on this blog : \nRoof’s racially motivated terrorist attack was in reality a twisted defense of white supremacy as articulated by white Christian extremists. \nAlso missing from the list, a mass shooting at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic in November 2015 committed by Robert Dear, an anti-abortion Christian terrorist . Dear was described by those who knew him as a Baptist who “believed wholeheartedly in the Bible.” \nBefore his attack, Dear had praised other anti-abortion, Christian terrorists as “doing God’s work.” \nMore recently, and also missing from Trump’s terror list, is Alexandre Bissonnette , a Trump loving terrorist and self-described Christian Crusader, who has been charged with six counts of murder after going on a shooting rampage at a mosque in Quebec late last month. \nAnd there are others. Mother Jones asks: \nAnd why has Trump mentioned nothing about a deadly shooting spree in 2014 by a longtime neo-Nazi at a Jewish community center and retirement home in Kansas? Or about the slaying of police officers in Las Vegas that year by right-wing extremists who left a swastika and a “ Don’t tread on me ” flag on the officers’ bodies? Or about the “ sovereign citizen ” charged in the shooting of five Black Lives Matter protesters last November? \nBottom line: For Trump, and the Trump White House, only Muslims can be terrorists.
