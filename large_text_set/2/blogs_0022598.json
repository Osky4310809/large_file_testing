It can’t get better than that. Honour: Naomie Harris receiving her OBE from the Queen (Yui Mok/PA) \n“I credit so much to Danny Boyle. He really gave me a chance when nobody else would at the start of my career when I had no credits to my name. \n“Then later on he gave me a part in Frankenstein at the National after having left drama school ten years before and not having done any theatre. He took a chance again and that’s how Bond happened.” Naomie Harris receives an OBE \nHarris said the Queen asked her about her upcoming projects and congratulated her on the success of her award winning film, Moonlight. \nSpeaking about meeting the monarch, Harris said: “I was impressed by how youthful she looked. She looked incredibly young and really healthy – and she has good skin.” Proud as punch: Naomie Harris with her OBE (John Stillwell/PA ) \nThe OBE comes days before Harris will head to Los Angeles for the 89th Academy Awards where she will vie for the Best Supporting Actress gong for her role in Moonlight. \nHarris plays a drug-addicted single mother in the Barry Jenkins directed hit which has already scooped gongs at the Writers Guild of America Awards and London Critics’ Circle Film Awards .
