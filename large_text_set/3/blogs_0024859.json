Made sure I checked his pulse. He had a weak pulse. Tony Davis: Army solider describes attempts to save PC Keith Palmer (ITV) \n‚ÄúHe was bleeding profusely. He had a head wound, which didn‚Äôt look too bad although it was bleeding. I know a lot of police were screaming ‚Äòhe‚Äôs been stabbed in the head‚Äô. \n‚ÄúBut then he had another wound in his arm, and another one that I believe was probably the fatal one by his rib cage. \n‚ÄúI put my raincoat underneath him and tried to stem the blood as much as possible.‚Äù Killed in terror attack: PC Keith Palmer (Metropolitan Police) \nMr Davis told hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby how he was in London with the British Lions boxing team and was to attend a press event in the House of Commons when the attack happened. \nOn Twitter, he wrote: ‚ÄúToday was supposed to be a good day at House of Commons, but it weren't. \n‚ÄúI am so sorry for the policeman I tried to help.

It is a huge tragedy, it really is. \n\"I tried to stem the flow of blood and give mouth to mouth while waiting for the medics to arrive but I think he had lost too much blood.\" \nThe attacker, who died along with three others in the attack, mowed down several pedestrians as he drove along Westminster Bridge before stabbing Mr Palmer. \nThe unnamed man was born in Britain and had previously been investigated by MI5 for violent extremism, Prime Minister Theresa May revealed on Thursday. \nMrs May briefed MPs in the Commons on Thursday morning and gave limited details about the man but said security services had not had any warning an attack was imminent.
