It all started after they made a couple appearance at Yuvraj Singh and Hazel Keech’s wedding and looked very much in love. In fact, more recently there were even speculations on how Sagarika and Zaheer are already planning to get married by this yearend or so. However, Sagarika prefers keeping her love life a low key affair as in her recent interaction with Mid Day, she clarified that she’s not someone who will open up about her personal life so easily. Yes… Also read: Zaheer Khan and actress Sagarika Ghatge to tie the knot? \nBeing very clear about the privacy that she needs, Sagarika reacted to the link-up rumours saying, “Let’s just say I am in a very happy space right now. I have never spoken about my personal relationships. In fact, I have never spoken about anything to the press. Personal space is not for discussion.” Sagarika was deliberately also very obtuse when asked about her equation with Zaheer Khan as she insisted, “I have no idea what are people thinking. I will remain just the way I am: low profile as ever. Why should I be any different just because I am linked to someone? I am not the kind who can put up a farce. I have no shame in admitting that I draw into my shell easily and come out only when I have to speak. I have big respect for Zaheer’s game and before you ask, yes he will watch my film (Irada) when it releases.” \nHere’s are a couple of pictures of Sagarika and Zaheer together: \nConsidering Sagarika has neither denied nor admitted her relationship with Zaheer, this certainly clarifies how the couple is very much together but just don’t wish to make it public by letting people invade into their privacy. Nevertheless, as said, Sagarika will next be seen alongside Arshad Warsi and Naseeruddin Shah in Irada as she recalled. “I play a character who is all heart. She strongly believes in justice. It is a novel film with a sensitive subject. Though most of my scenes are with Arshad, I would stay back on set and watch Naseer saab give his shots. For me, working with an actor of his stature is the biggest high.” \nWedding bells or no? You decide!
