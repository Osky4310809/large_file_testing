Photos suggested it got off to a good start - they gave the president a standing ovation as he walked into the room. Lengthy standing ovation from the Freedom Caucus when @POTUS walked into the Cabinet Room just now.

All say no deal made, no \"firm\" changes agreed to. — Ben Kamisar (@bkamisar) March 23, 2017 \nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) put it just as bluntly: \"No deal.\" \nAs of Wednesday, 25 members of the House Freedom Caucus said they were solid \"no\"s .
