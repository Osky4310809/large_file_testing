Once the state traditional medicine Board is fully operational the issue of promoting quackery would be adequately curtailed”. \nOlulade who is representing Epe constituency II also noted that the state government would not tolerate sharp practices noticeable in public hospitals in the state. \nHe however advised members of the public to report any errant health workers engaging in unprofessional conduct in the course of their duty to ensure that culprits are brought to book. \n“We have numbers displayed at all our public hospitals, people should make use of those numbers by sending text messages. If anyone of health workers is found wanting, they will face the music,” Olulade said. \nHe however lamented the challenges facing health sector in the state which according to him include shortage of personnel and poor referral system adding that, state government would address the shortage of personnel. He urged patients to make use of primary health centres, saying if there is need for referral, it would be done at the centres.
