This cooler was donated over the weekend to the Goodwill. Employees surprised when they opened the lid. Police were called... pic.twitter.com/50z1OinsER — Monroe PD (@MonroePolice) March 14, 2017 \nMonroe Police Department said the cooler contained 3.75 pounds of pot, with an estimated street value of $24,000, according to Q13 Fox News. The police posted images of the pot filled icebox online. \nHowever online ‘experts’ surmised that the police has overestimated the value of the cannabis haul. @MonroePolice Who the hell pays $6400 a pound for pot ? — Robert DeSantis (@RobertDeSantis1) March 15, 2017 @MonroePolice LOL 24k! Is there 23k in gold underneath the weed? — Patti Fuzz (@PattiFuzz) March 15, 2017 \nIt’s unclear whether the mystery donor intended to offload the marijuana stash to the charity shop or if they had simply forgotten it was in the cooler. \nPolice said the shop is reviewing CCTV footage in efforts to identify the benefactor. \nIn 2012 Washington legalized recreational marijuana for adults 21 years of age or older, however, personal use is limited up to one ounce. The sale, distribution, and cultivation of marijuana remain a federal offense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:24:22.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
