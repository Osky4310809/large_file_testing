Something simple. Something fitted. \nNot much make-up and something simple that fits your body. The same way a skinny lady wouldn’t benefit from saggy clothes, a chubby one wouldn’t benefit from skinny clothes. Just grab something simples that fits your body and wear a smile on that face. :) 4. Don’t be too hot? \nI won’t notice her clothes at the first date unless she really made an effort to look hot. I am mostly focused on her lips, eyes and facial expressions. If she, however, dressed to be the hot femme fatale, then I’ll probably see her as a sexual and not a romantic partner. 5. No Granny panties. \nSorry but most men are not very into fashion. I will say however I always take hints from the underwear a girl wears. Cotton is just for friends on a casual night out. The nice stuff tells me she picked that out because she wants it to go somewhere. And the thick waistband granny panties tell me to stay away because a tampon has beat me there. 6. Dress for the occasion . \nJust dress appropriately for the venue. \nAt a nice italian place for a first date and she shows up in running pants and an athletic top. Feels a little awkward when I’m in pressed slacks and a button-up. \nCome to think of it, this has happened a few times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T06:00:59.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
