ACE MORANDANTE/Presidential Photo \nSOCORRO, Oriental Mindoro — President Rodrigo Duterte confronted US Ambassador Sung Kim about the United States’ supposed inaction on China’s massive island-building in the South China Sea. \nMr. Duterte himself disclosed the confrontation in a speech to local officials and residents here on Wednesday. \nBut Kim apparently dodged the issue, telling Mr. Duterte that the matter was not his responsibility at the time. ADVERTISEMENT \nKim met with Mr. Duterte on Monday, the eve of the President’s 72nd birthday. \nMr. Duterte recalled telling the US ambassador that he was surprised that the United States, which wanted to avoid trouble in the South China Sea, did not take immediate action when it spotted China’s construction of structures on artificial islands it had built in the disputed waters. \n“Why did you not send the armada of the 7th Fleet stationed in the Pacific to make a U-turn, go there, and tell them right to their face, ‘Stop it,’” he said he told Kim. \nHe said he told Kim that international law prohibits building structures on the high seas. \nIn response, he said, Kim told him: “That was not my assignment then.” \nKim said he was in charge of North Korean affairs at the time. \nKim served then as US special representative for North Korea policy. \nEarlier, Mr. Duterte blamed the United States for not taking action to stop China’s aggressive construction activities in the South China Sea, which have raised fears that Beijing is militarizing the strategic waterway believed to be rich in resources.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:31:38.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
