ADVERTISEMENT \n“I want to, hopefully, end my career with San Miguel,” the 32-year-old Ross told SportsIQ, INQUIRER’s omni-platform sports talk show, on Thursday. \nRoss was instrumental in the Beermen’s third straight PBA Philippine Cup triumph after he averaged 12.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 1.8 steals in their five-game series against Ginebra. \nAnd he’s not satisfied with three straight Philippine Cups. \nSan Miguel, despite being the PBA’s winningest team with 23 titles, has always fallen short of replicating its 1989 Grand Slam feat. \nThe Beermen almost won the Grand Slam in the 2014-2015 season but failed to enter the Commissioner’s Cup finals. \n“I know the guys are hungry to end that spell and when a franchise hasn’t done something for so long, you want to achieve those things,” said Ross.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:26:00.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
