And Kate McKinnon’s stunning sparkly black halter dress at the 2017 Oscars is like your classic LBD jacked up to about 1,000.\nThe gown, designed by Narcisco Rodriguez is stunning, and the deep V illuminates McKinnon’s mega-watt smile. The back of the dress looks pretty awesome too , with two thin bands holding the halter in place. Her blonde hair is styled in effortless loose curls, which is complimented by her Chopard earrings. She’s also wearing delicate and beautiful bracelets — also by Chopard.\n\nLet’s get a closer look. Jeff Kravitz/Getty Images Firstly, LOL. This face is our everything, and we predict it to be one of the greatest GIF-inspos the world has ever known. Or at least of 2017. Secondly, we’re officially obsessed with those straps. They elevate an otherwise totally conventional (though stunning) black dress into something truly unique. Perfect for the stunning and unique McKinnon, if we do say so ourselves.\nAccording to USA Today , McKinnon showed up to the rehearsals in her Stuart Weitzman heels along with socks, leggings and a hoodie. No, she wasn’t rocking some sort of new fashion statement, she was trying to break her shoes in before she had to actually take the stage for the real deal!\nvia GIPHY \nAs if she couldn’t get more relatable. Love you, Kate! And LOVE this dress!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:22:38.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
