It isn’t immediately clear when the initiative will be expanded and which countries in Asia might be next, but Uber did explain more on why it maps locally in a blog post : \nExisting maps are a good starting point, but some information isn’t that relevant to Uber, like ocean topography. There are other things we need to know a lot more about, like traffic patterns and precise pick-up and drop-off locations. We need to be able to provide a seamless experience in parts of the world where there aren’t detailed maps — or street signs. \nUber mapping cars have been used in the U.S., UK, Australia, Mexico, Canada and South Africa. Uber hired two executives from Google’s Maps team — Brian McClendon and Manik Gupta — to handle its mapping efforts, while it also acquired a maps-focused startup back in 2015 . \nThe company is increasing its focus on India and Southeast Asia after agreeing to sell its loss-making China business , which was costing it an estimated $1 billion per year, to rival Didi Chuxing. Now, Uber is increasing its efforts to rival Ola in India, where it recently introduced hire cars , and battling Grab, which last year raised $750 million led by SoftBank , in Southeast Asia. \nAs we reported last year , Uber is already profitable in parts of Southeast Asia, and it is working to introduce other services in the region, including UberEats — which came to Singapore last year and recently went live in Bangkok, Thailand. \nIt isn’t all singing and dancing for the U.S. firm in Asia however. It exited China via the Didi deal, this month it suspended its service in Taiwan following government pressure, and it is facing tough challenges in South Korea and Japan.
