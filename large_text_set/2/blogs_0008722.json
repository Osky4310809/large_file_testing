Those two took the opportunity to announce their divorce, calling it “for the best.” \nBack at home, Jack was nervous that Rebecca didn’t seem surprised by the divorce, and when she shrugged and said that people just drift apart sometimes, she had to quickly amend the statement with, “I wasn’t talking about us!” Sterling K. Brown as Randall Pearson, Susan Kelechi Watson as Beth Pearson Ron Batzdorff/NBC \nJack Confronts Miguel \nAt work later, Jack misplaced his marriage frustrations and got angry with Miguel. When he confronted him, Miguel said, “Not everyone is like you and Rebecca!” \nHe told the story of when he realized he and Shelly had “stopped noticing each other,” then considered whether to keep fighting or give up. \nElsewhere, Rebecca’s pianist suggested Jack might not really love her if he didn’t immediately agree she should go on a singing tour of the East Coast, causing her to spit, “My husband’s a freaking superhero, and you have no idea what you’re talking about.” \nLooks like Rebecca chose fighting! (Pass the tissues, someone. Please!) \nRandall Has a Worse Time With Will Dying Than Will Does \nRandall (Sterling K. Brown) had a dream that his dad, William ( Ron Cephas Jones ), had died, but woke up to find his daughter Tess playing chess with him in the middle of the night. We don’t know what was more heartbreaking: Randall not knowing his kid had been enrolled in a chess tournament she needed to practice for, or her begging for more time with William by saying, “You always tell us he won’t be here forever…” \nThe 3 a.m. escapades led Randall to look into more care for William, but at the mention of “hospice,” he got up and marched out. He spent the rest of the episode asking Beth ( Susan Kelechi Watson ) if he’d done the wrong thing by allowing a dying man into his kids’ lives. Chris Sullivan as Toby Damon, Chrissy Metz as Kate Pearson Ron Batzdorff/NBC \nRandall Can’t Win \nBecause he chose to go with Beth and William to Tess’ chess tournament, Randall missed a client dinner with Sanjay. The next day at work, his biggest fear — or, at least, second-biggest fear — from the last few weeks came true: His boss told him Sanjay was getting half of his clients. \nAt home, he tried to drink a glass of water, but his hand was shaking too hard to grab it, which killed Us. \n“I’m Still in Love With You” \nFor reasons we can’t quite figure out, Sophie ( Alexandra Breckinridge ) agreed to meet Kevin (Justin Hartley) at the restaurant where they shared their first kiss. He got there early and convinced an elderly couple to get out of the booth where the kiss had happened. When she arrived, she said, “I only came here today to tell you to go screw yourself,” but stopped short when she saw that he’d ordered the same food they’d eaten that day in eighth grade. \nIt didn’t take long for him to put his foot in his mouth, which sent her running out of the restaurant. He caught up to her, and she told him she absolutely didn’t want to relive him cheating on her. Somehow, that led to him accidentally admitting he created a fake Facebook profile to keep up with her life. \nThough she was flattered, Sophie had to tell Kevin that she was finally dating a nice guy and was happy. Before she walked away, he said, “I’m still in love with you,” then told her that if she changed her mind, he’d be at their restaurant the next morning. The suspense! Milo Ventimiglia as Jack Pearson, Mandy Moore as Rebecca Pearson Ron Batzdorff/NBC \nKate Isn’t the Best Girlfriend Right Now, Like, at All \nToby ( Chris Sullivan ) showed up to see Kate ( Chrissy Metz ) at her weight-loss camp. She was touched, but didn’t want him to screw up her progress again, so she sent him away. On the way out of the compound, he ran into Duke, the camp employee who had been hitting on Kate constantly. \nDuke implied that he and Kate had hooked up, leaving Toby to stand there stunned. When he bought some workout clothes and came back to motivate her, Kate yelled at him for annoying her, so he revealed he’d brought his grandmother’s ring as a surprise. Then, he left.
