The woven hooded jacket features lightweight mesh and translucent water-resistant nylon to block wind and rain. The knit short pants are made with Japanese looped back French Terry that balances warmth and weight, provides stretch and has a dry touch finish. The short sleeve top is constructed from a stretchable and durable lightweight fabric that prevents loss of shape. Every piece features a glow-in-the-dark 3D hexagon graphic that is the collection’s emblem.\nJYUNI means “twelve” in Japanese but it also represents the movement of time and the constraints time brings. The concept behind the collection is to encourage individuals to break free from those constraints. The collection follows on from the new MetaRun concept running shoe inspired by the contrast between modern Tokyo’s gray concrete buildings and traditional Tokyo’s use of red. Both the MetaRun and JYUNI project represent traditional Japanese design through a combination of minimalism, beauty and functionality. In this way, the collection reflects ASICS’s brand DNA while remaining technologically innovative.\nThe JYUNI White jacket, short pants and top will retail at $270, $125 and $105; the collection launches in Tokyo on January 27 and globally on February 10.
