Jesus Christ - Profile of Jesus Christ from the New Testament: \nJesus of Nazarethâ€”he is the Christ, the \"Anointed One,\" or the \"Messiah.\" The name \"Jesus\" is derived from the Hebrew-Aramaic word \" Yeshua ,\" meaning \"Yahweh [the Lord] is salvation.\" The name \"Christ\" is actually a title for Jesus. It comes from the Greek word \"Christos,\" meaning \"the Anointed One,\" or \"Messiah\" in Hebrew. \nJesus is the central figure in Christianity. His life, message and ministry are chronicled in the four Gospels of the New Testament . \nMost Bible scholars agree that Jesus was a Jewish teacher from Galilee who performed many miracles of healing and deliverance. He called 12 Jewish men to follow him, working closely with them to train and prepare them to carry on the ministry. \nJesus Christ was crucified in Jerusalem by order of Pontius Pilate , the Roman governor, for claiming to be the King of the Jews. He resurrected three days after his death, appeared to his disciples, and then ascended into heaven. \nHis life and death provided the atoning sacrifice for the sins of the world. Man was separated from God through Adam 's sin, but reconciled back to God through Jesus Christ's sacrifice. He will claim his Bride , the church, and later return at his Second Coming to judge the world and establish his eternal kingdom, thus fulfilling messianic prophecy . Jesus Christ's Accomplishments: \nJesus Christ's accomplishments are too numerous to list. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit , and born of a virgin. He lived a sinless life. He turned water into wine , healed many sick, blind and lame people, he forgave sins, he multiplied fish and loaves of bread to feed thousands on more than one occasion, he delivered the demon possessed, he walked on water , he calmed the stormy sea, he raised children and adults from death to life. Jesus Christ proclaimed the good news of the Kingdom of God . \nHe laid down his life and was crucified . He descended into hell and took the keys of death and hell. He resurrected from the dead. Jesus Christ paid for the sins of the world and purchased the pardon of men. He restored man's fellowship with God, opening the way to eternal life . These are just a few of his extraordinary accomplishments. Jesus Christ's Strengths: \nThough difficult to understand, the Bible teaches and Christians believe that Jesus is God, or Immanuel , \"God with us.\" Jesus Christ has always existed and has always been God (John 8:58 and 10:30). \nFor more information about Christ's divinity, visit this study of the doctrine of the trinity . Jesus Christ's Weaknesses: \nAlso difficult to understand, yet the Bible teaches and most Christians believe, Jesus Christ was not only fully God, but fully man. He became a human being so that he could identify with our weaknesses and struggles, and most importantly so that he could give his life to pay the penalty for our sins (John 1:1,14; Hebrews 2:17; Philippians 2:5-11). \nCheck out this resource for more information about why Jesus had to die . Life Lessons: \nOnce again, the lessons from Jesus Christ's life are too numerous to list. Love for mankind, sacrifice, humility, purity, servanthood, obedience and devotion to God are some of the most important lessons that his life exemplified. Hometown: \nJesus Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judea and grew up in Nazareth in Galilee . Referenced in the Bible: \nJesus is mentioned more than 1200 times in the New Testament. His life, message and ministry are recorded in the four Gospels of the New Testament : Matthew , Mark , Luke and John . Occupation: \nJesus' earthly father, Joseph , was a carpenter, or skilled craftsman by trade. Most likely, Jesus worked alongside his father Joseph as a carpenter. In the book of Mark, chapter 6, verse 3, Jesus is referred to as a carpenter.
