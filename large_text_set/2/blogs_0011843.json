Earlier this month, Bowie posthumously swept the 2017 Grammy Awards with five wins for his final album “Blackstar.” \nCASTING \nCelebrated chef and restaurateur Aarón Sánchez will join Gordon Ramsay and Christina Tosi as the third judge for the upcoming eighth season of “Masterchef” on Fox .

DATES \nCartoon Network has set the premiere of new animated series “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs” for Monday, March 6 . The series is based on Sony Pictures Animation’s 2009 animated feature of the same name, and its 2013 sequel, “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2.” The new incarnation takes place before giant food rains down on Swallow Falls, with the original’s central character Flint Lockwood returning as a teenager trying to change the world, one invention at a time. The world’s most innovative cosplayers are set to go head-to-head each week in Syfy’s new transformation competition series “Cosplay Melee,” premiering Tuesday, March 21 on Syfy . The hour-long battle is hosted by actress Yvette Nicole Brown and each week, four cosplayers compete to create fully-formed characters that they must bring to life through their own realistic performance.

Pegged to World Water Day on March 22 , National Geographic has announced two new projects from Academy Award-winner Alex Gibney that will air throughout the month of March. First, following its debut at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, is the feature documentary “ Water & Power: A California Heist,” directed by Marina Zenovich with Gibney as exec producer. The film unfolds like a real-life version of the 1974 film noir “Chinatown,” as it peels back the layers of California’s history of water manipulations, and will air on March 14 . Second, beginning on Tuesday, March 21 , National Geographic and Jigsaw Productions will present “ Parched,” a three-part companion series narrated by Gibney that investigates water wars, from West Virginia and Michigan to Syria and India.
