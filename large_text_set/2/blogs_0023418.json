Found in all temperate to tropical oceans yet rarely seen, the oarfish like to lurk at least 300 feet below the surface. Human encounters with live oarfish are rare. Most information is collated from records of oarfish that have been caught or washed ashore. They are often been labeled as earthquake predictors because they tend to wash up on the shore before and after tremors. The plankton-eating bony fish have no scales.
