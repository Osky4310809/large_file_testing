Well, after the all-you-can-hit run buffets that were the three ODIs, this Twenty20 series has been agreeably shaped by the bowlers, giving us a chance to admire the death-overs arts of the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Chris Jordan. The second match in particular demonstrated that low-scoring is no impediment to excitment and tension in T20, particularly if it comes laced with umpiring TALKING POINTS, notably the reprieves of Virat Kohli and the dismissal of Joe Root. Mercifully, Root has been playing it all down , in best diplomatic ‘ah-well-we-all-make-mistakes’ mode. The Shakoor Rana affair this ain’t (ask your grandad). \nThe umpire at the centre of it all, Chettithody Shamshuddin, stands again today, in a match that is unlikely to follow the patterns of the previous two. The pitch at the M Chinnaswamy stadium is a proper shirtfront, by all accounts, a slogger’s paradise, which threatens a busy old evening in the field for England’s players whose long two-pronged Asian tour finally ends today. How different the world was was back when it all started, at the beginning of October, with that dramatic 50-over win against Bangladesh . England have learned a lot about themselves, in all forms of the game, since then, not all of it heartening. But they’ve competed very well in this T20 series and Bengaluru should see a suitably rousing end to the tour. \nPlay starts 1.30pm GMT, 7pm local time.
