Another document shows dozens of working exploits that US agencies, including the FBI, can use to conduct surveillance and intelligence gathering on Apple users. \nOther files , some classified as \"top secret,\" detail sensitive reflashing procedures for modern iPhones, which allow the cyber unit to configure devices to a particular operating system and setting, in order to carry out \"exploits and implants for high priority target cell phones for intelligence collection.\" \nSome of the vulnerabilities appear to be as recent as iOS 9, released in late 2015. \nThe CIA claimed at the end of 2016 to have 24 zero-days for Android phones and devices , developed by its own staff or obtained by third-parties. \nIn some cases, exploits have been \"purchased\" by the NSA and shared with the CIA and British intelligence counterpart GCHQ. \nHowever, it's not believed that the exploit code have been released as part of the publication, unlike similar data breaches . \nMany of the other exploits include Windows desktop and server operating systems, Macs, Linux machines, and other major enterprise software, such as VMware. \nTony Robinson, a former staffer with Tailored Access Operations, the NSA's hacking unit, called the leaks \"disconcerting\" in a tweet . \n\"The bigger problem is that this exposes more of our tradecraft. The cards are on the table,\" he said. \nA CIA spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents.\" \nA spokesperson for the Office of Director of National Intelligence could not be immediately reached for comment.
