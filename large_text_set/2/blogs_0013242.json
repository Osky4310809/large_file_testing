Chance the Rapper , Mick Jenkins , Vic Mensa, and other Chicago artists who are now well-known across the country used to flock to the arts center for a weekly open mic. Earlier this week, the YouTube account GOAT Videos uploaded an interview with a 15-year-old Chance that was filmed at YouMedia. \nYoung Chance speaks with his friend J-Emcee about a song he wrote called \"Beddy Bye.\" \n“I’ver known Justin since I was 8 years old,” he said. “My dad was Barack Obama’s campaign manager for a long time and he recently moved to D.C. and I found out that I was moving too, and we wrote ‘Beddy Bye’ a little while ago. It’s definitely real, it was a hard song to write. I think I rewrote it 8 or 9 times.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:14:13.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
