They went on to say the animals also participate in their “Penguins on Parade” event at the zoo, and are “very comfortable around people and noises.” \nThe letter from PETA ends by asking: “May we please hear that the NHL will implement a policy against having animals at its games and events? ” \nTo read the full letter from PETA, click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:51:58.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
