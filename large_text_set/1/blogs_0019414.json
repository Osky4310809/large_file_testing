Many are women with different agendas and contrasting opinions on President-elect Donald Trump . \nTheresa Mungioli is chairman of the Oakland County Republican Party, just outside of Detroit. She and her friend Pam Williams are preparing for their trip to the nation’s capital to attend the 58th Presidential Inauguration. \nTheresa Mungioli. CBS News \n”It is an exceptional opportunity to go and be able to celebrate with all these people who have worked so hard to get Donald Trump where he is,” she said. “I am truly looking forward to being able to say ‘yay we did it,’” she said. \nMungioli said she is hoping people will give Mr. Trump a chance. \n“He has promised to be a president for everyone, not just the people that voted for him,” she said. \nWomen who didn’t vote for him, women who were shocked when Mr. Trump turned a blue state red, assembled Thursday just 30 miles south, in Detroit. \nThey’re preparing to attend the Women’s March on Washington, D.C., this Saturday. Phoebe Hopps is organizing Michigan’s delegation. \nPhoebe Hopps. CBS News \nWhy mobilize more than 5,000 women to go to Washington D.C. the day after the inauguration? \n“We saw a huge need for our voices to be heard in D.C.,” she said. \nPamela Wall signed up. She said she is going to D.C. because she has to go, “If I’m not doing something I’m going crazy. “ \nThey fear a rollback of progress on women’s issues, but they hope the rally sparks an outpouring of activism. \nWhen it comes to Mr. Trump, specifically for those who support him and say give him a chance, Hopps said, “We are watching.” \n“What we’re doing is actually going to help him learn what are the types of things he can do to help us,” she said. \nThere are similar efforts happening in all 50 states. Organizers for the Women’s March have a permit for 200,000 people. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
