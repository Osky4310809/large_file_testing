(Photo: The CW/Warner Bros. TV) \nBlack Lightning stars Cress Williams ( Hart of Dixie ) as Jefferson Pierce/Black Lightning. \nThe costume for Black Lightning was designed by Laura Jean Shannon, whose many film and television credits include the upcoming Jumanji sequel, The Jungle Book , Scott Pilgrim vs. The World , Blade: Trinity , Good Girls Revolt and Iron Man , for which she was nominated for a Costume Designers Guild Award. \nIt incorporates elements of the classic comic book look, along with the leather-and-armor aesthetic common to The CW's DC Universe shows and high-tech elements that appear to be microcircuitry a la Batman Beyond . \n“I knew way too much about the world as a young boy growing up in Richmond, California. I was no stranger to violence, death, hopelessness or the feeling that no one cared about what was happening in my life, ” said executive producer and writer Salim Akil, who will direct the pilot. “Comics were a great way for me to escape. I was about 13 when Black Lightning was created, and finally there was a Black Super Hero that gave a damn about our neighborhood and our lives. Resurrecting him at a time in our society when a sense of hope is lacking...Black Lightning will be that hope. And in updating the suit, it will signal to a new generation that it’s time to harness and release our power, and become our own Super Heroes.” \nThe first African-American DC Super Hero to have his own stand-alone comic title, Black Lightning is based on the character created by Tony Isabella with Trevor Von Eeden in 1977. Jefferson Pierce made his choice: he hung up the suit and his secret identity years ago, but with one daughter hell-bent on justice and the other a star student being recruited by a local gang, he’ll be pulled back into the fight as the wanted vigilante and DC legend — Black Lightning. \nGreg Berlanti, Salim Akil, Mara Brock Akil and Sarah Schechter are executive producers of Black Lightning , from Berlanti Productions and Akil Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. Salim Akil is directing the pilot from a script he wrote. \nJefferson Pierce made his choice: he hung up the suit and his secret identity years ago, but with a daughter hell-bent on justice and a star student being recruited by a local gang, he’ll be pulled back into the fight as the wanted vigilante and DC legend — Black Lightning. \nMORE BLACK LIGHTNING NEWS :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:21:47.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
