And that's what we all said when we got out for the first time. \n\"I think they will be the fastest cars we have ever driven. it is nice to have that. Competitiveness? We are all here to find out.\" Media playback is not supported on this device F1: Christian Horner on tyres, overtaking and shoeys 'I have never seen the fans so excited' \nThe season starts without the reigning world champion on the track for the first time since 1994 - Alain Prost retired after winning his fourth title in 1993 - following Hamilton's team-mate Rosberg decision to retire. He has been replaced by Finn Valtteri Bottas. \nHamilton, 32, said: \"It doesn't make any difference to me. Every year is a brand new challenge. You just want to beat whoever it is you're up against and the bigger the fight the more satisfying it is. \n\"I have never seen the fans as excited [than they are] about this year, not knowing where the cars and teams are. More of these changes would be welcome. Maybe they should shorten the time between rule changes.\" \nHamilton said he would relish a fight for the title with Vettel, who won four consecutive championships with Red Bull from 2010-13. \nAnd the Briton added that he would like to see old rival Fernando Alonso back in a competitive car, which seems a forlorn hope given a dire pre-season for the 35-year-old Spaniard's McLaren-Honda team. \n\"I have not had a lot of battles with Sebastian on track, and I would love that and the fans would too,\" Hamilton said. \"And for him [Alonso] to be up there, too, before his time is up. I would love that. We haven't seen the best of Fernando.\" \nHamilton added that he was also wary of the threat from Red Bull drivers Daniel Ricciardo, 27, and 19-year-old Max Verstappen. \n\"I am very keen to see what Red Bull bring because they were quite far behind in testing compared to Ferrari,\" Hamilton said. \n\"I didn't see many upgrades and I am excited to see what they bring here.\" Australian Grand Prix Coverage details Date", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:50:07.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
