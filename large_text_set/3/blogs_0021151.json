But The Post reports that: “the $26.8 million budget item is marked as $0 in previous years, which former Secret Service agents said likely meant that the costs were part of a new budget category designed to encapsulate the unusual expense of protecting the first lady and the president’s youngest son because they live outside the White House.”\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack \nA source with knowledge of the Secret Service’s internal budget discussions told The Post that the requests for additional funding have been rejected by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget — which means the agency will likely have to dip into other funding to cover the additional costs of protecting the president and his family, the newspaper says.\nAnd the Secret Service doesn’t have much choice in the matter.\nLongtime Secret Service employee Jonathan Wackrow tells The Post , “The Secret Service cannot dictate the lifestyle of the protectee. They have to work around it. I don’t think they expected him to go to Florida so often. This was an unanticipated reality.”\nFROM COINAGE: This Is How Much It Would Cost to Paint the White House (And More Crazy Facts) \nTrump has gone to Mar-a-Lago five times since his inauguration two months ago. The Post reported earlier this month that Trump’s first three Mar-a-Lago weekends alone have cost taxpayers $10 million dollars .\nHis most recent trip this past weekend came one day after the president proposed a federal budget that would slash funding for many government programs — a juxtaposition that did not go unnoticed by Twitter.\nTrump's budget eliminates federal funding for NPR, NEA. If he stopped going to Mar-a-Lago, we could keep them. #mtp https://t.co/hQj0nyVWdx \n— Skylar Baker-Jordan (@SkylarJordan) March 19, 2017 \n@POTUS how do you sleep at night?!

And on the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to avoid vacations and expensive travel.\n“There’s no time for vacation. We’re not going to be big on vacations,” he said at a campaign rally. “The White House is this incredible place. It represents so much, and you’re there for a limited period of time. If you’re at the White House and you have so much work to do, why do you fly? Why do you leave so much?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:53:29.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
