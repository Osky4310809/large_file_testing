King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 4 hours ago 9 \nOne of Ghost's Nameless Ghouls, who describes himself as the band's \"main songwriter,\" recently talked about the \"puritans of metal\" and their tendency to \"always complain about bands getting bigger.\" \nDiscussing how \" Square Hammer \" became a massive hit, the musician told Loudwire : \n\"I honestly believe that most bands go through a similar thing. That's why the most anal sort of puritans of metal always complain about bands getting bigger, but what's usually happening is that the club band that does a record, or a few records being a club band and then they grow into bigger venues, they normally go for a more commercialized sound. \n\"Commercial doesn't necessarily mean they only write songs only to sell records. It's basically - you want to play music that works well with a bigger crowd. Like, physically, and you want it to sound good in a big room. \n\"I'm sure that's why the ' Black Album ' sounds different from ' ...And Justice for All ,' because all of a sudden then were playing these big, boomy arenas and when you play - I love hearing ' Battery ' or their thrashiest songs ever, but ' Enter Sandman ' sounds way better and bigger in an arena. \n\"It's a natural way. You hear that on Maiden as well. As soon as they started getting bigger, the songs started getting straighter and it just worked in a bigger environment.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T06:24:39.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
