PUBLISHED: 22:34, Sun, Feb 26, 2017 | UPDATED: 22:44, Sun, Feb 26, 2017 GETTY Martyn Waghorn reckons Rangers can still finish second despite being nine points behind Aberdeen \nThe managerless Light Blues’ slipped up again at Inverness and allowed Aberdeen to pull nine points clear over the weekend. \nWaghorn isn’t too concerned and believes things can quickly turn back in their favour, especially as they still have to play the Dons on two further occasions in the Premiership. \nWhen asked if second spot was now out of Rangers’ reach, Waghorn answered: “Not at all. We have got to play Aberdeen again twice. \n“It is obviously not ideal them being so far ahead. We have got a big challenge ahead of us, but we know what we have got to do. \n“It is going to be difficult, but we can turn it around. \n“We have got a lot of good players in the squad and a lot of belief. Never say never. We have got to just go again.” PA Martyn Waghorn scoring from the penalty spot for Rangers in their 2-1 defeat to Inverness \nThe Light Blues will step up their search for a new manager and director of football this week. \nWaghorn knows, in the meantime, the Ibrox players need to start managing themselves far better on the pitch. \nCaretaker boss Graeme Murty has overseen back-to-back defeats to Dundee and Inverness and Waghorn thinks they need to be better at both ends of the park. \n“Yeah, it is giving us a tough challenge,” the Englishman acknowledged. “It is making our lives difficult. \n“Inverness were down there at the bottom of the table fighting for their lives and they were always going to make it difficult for us to win. It is something that we need to address. If we get the first goal, it’s a different story. We have made it difficult for ourselves and that is something that we need to sort out. \n“You are playing for Rangers. You need to be clinical, you need to score goals and you need to win games and we are not doing that right now.” PA Martyn Waghorn dejected at the final whistle in the 2-1 defeat to Inverness \nThe striker knows the team have let the fans down in recent weeks and they need to start repaying them. \n“The players are together,” Waghorn added. \n“Obviously it is a difficult time not having a full-time manager, but we are still the same squad. Murts knows the direction that we are going in. \n“He has got everyone on board. It is up to us as players to take responsibility. \n“We know what we have got to do, it is just a matter of executing it. On the day against Inverness we weren’t good enough in front of goal. \n“We were hugely disappointed and deflated. It is a bitter pill to swallow, but we have got to stick together. It is a frustrating time.

The only way we can get out of this is by working hard, staying together and trying to turn it around. \n“It is only us who can do it. Nobody else is going to do it for us. It is up to us as players to take responsibility.” \nThe former Wigan frontman thinks Rangers need to get back to basics. \nHe said: “I can understand that because we haven’t won games and at Rangers you have got to win games and be going forward. \n“The last two results are nowhere near the level that we should be at. But we need to rally and stick together as a team going forward. It is part of football. It is all about how you respond and how you react to adversity. \n“This is a difficult time. But I can’t stress this enough, it is only us who can turn it around. \n“Doing it for the club is all that we can do.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:53:42.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
