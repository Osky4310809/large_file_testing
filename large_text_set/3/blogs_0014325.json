As reported by CNN , Ben Affleck has just completed alcohol addiction treatment. This is not his first visit to rehab. Ben Affleck also sought treatment in 2001. Ben Affleck is hoping that his personal troubles can at least be used as inspiration by those hesitant to face down their vices. Perhaps his life can serve as a cautionary tale. There is a large percentage of the population who feels that occasional alcohol consumption can benefit their health. Regardless of the merits of this view, too much alcohol is a recipe for disaster. The fact that alcohol abuse can take a terrible toll on your health should come as no surprise. Alcohol can impair decision-making abilities and motor skills. It is frequently a factor in vehicular accidents, violent behaviors, unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Alcohol-related deaths reached a 35-year high in 2014, when more than 30,700 Americans died from such causes as alcohol poisonings and cirrhosis. This amounted to about 9.6 deaths from alcohol-induced causes per 100,000 people in 2014 â€” a 37 percent increase since 2002. These numbers do not include deaths from alcohol-related homicides, drunk driving or other accidents. If those figures were included, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest alcohol-related deaths would be closer to 90,000 . The impact of alcohol is not limited to acute incidents and disastrous downward spirals. It can have a more subtle and pernicious influence on your wellbeing as well. Alcohol can alter your brain chemistry and lower the levels of serotonin, a mood-regulating chemical in your brain, increasing your anxiety and stress instead of reducing it. I advise against drinking when you are feeling down or depressed. Alcohol can also disturb your gut biome, which has a powerful influence on your physical and mental health. By altering the balance of bacteria in your digestive tract, alcohol can dramatically weaken your immune system. Once your immune system is compromised, your body becomes far more vulnerable to all sorts of foreign invaders, inflammation and disease. Keep in mind that women are more vulnerable to alcohol poisoning. They feel the effects of alcohol faster than men of the same size and are predisposed to suffer from long-term alcohol-induced health damage. Rather than falling into the vicious cycle of alcohol abuse, I recommend addressing your emotional health as soon as possible. Try Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) , which is one of the most effective energy psychology tools for me. Whether or not moderate alcohol consumption can be safe and even healthy is controversial, with studies showing a mixed bag of results. Some studies have shown that alcohol consumption may be associated with an increased risk of cancer, even at moderate levels of intake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:54:52.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
