Don't miss Blackburn v Newcastle. Watch live on NOW TV today for Â£6.99. No contract. \nHe told the Bournemouth Daily Echo : \"We're delighted with him and I'm sure he's happy here too. \n\"He's been in the game long enough and he's had speculation from the minute he signed here and started to score goals straightaway. \n\"He's been linked with clubs throughout that period. It's nothing new for him or for us. \n\"Management of game time at this time of year is crucial. We love Callum, I think he's an outstanding player. He's done well for us this season but we need to make sure every player is fresh when they play.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:24:19.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
