Then AdSemble will automatically serve the ad to different billboards across its network, optimized to deliver the most impressions for your budget. \nOpen Display also includes a performance report showing where the ads are being displayed, with photographic evidence. \nIf you come from the world of online advertising, this might just sound like the ad-buying should work, rather than something special. But that’s kind of the point: AdSemble has been trying to simplify the often complicated process of buying billboard ads. (It launched a self-serve product for the billboard owners last year.)

Perhaps it is now.\nOpen Display is currently available to advertisers in San Francisco, with plans to add Chicago, New York and Los Angeles by the end of the year. Also, the first 100 advertisers to sign up with the code “techcrunch” will get a $50 credit on their account.
