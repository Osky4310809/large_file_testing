Mr. Obama replaced it with a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. \nReporters who were summoned to the Oval Office Friday night to witness Mr. Trump signing an executive order noticed the Churchill bust had been returned to the Oval Office. \nMedia initially mistakenly said that the bust of Martin Luther King had been removed and replaced with Churchill, but that was based on a mistaken report. The King bust is still there. \nNice that a candidate finally keeps a promise… LIKE this article?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:05:19.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
