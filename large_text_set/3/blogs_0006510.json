Today, we have a 3,400-square-foot home in Boston-Edison that needs to find the right new owner. At 11 a.m., the price is already up to $16,600 . How much will the house go for today? If you’re not all that familiar with the Land Bank auctions, you need to be ready to rehab if you win a house. Generally, you’d have six months, but since this one is in a historic district, the new owner will have nine. This house has four bedrooms, so many windows, and original tiling in the bathrooms. We’re dreaming of the potential here, and hoping that the new owner invites us over to see the rehab. How much will it go for? How will the new owner rehab it? Bidding ends at 5 p.m. More details can be found here .
