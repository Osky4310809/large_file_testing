He should have known that stuff on the pitch goes before anything.” \nGullit also feels that the Old Trafford faithful could turn on Pogba if he fails to justify his huge price tag on the pitch and that his priority must always be to his club. \nMan Utd all-time top 10 goalscorers \n“Pogba will also get the wrath of the fans. People will start to moan and have a go at him,” he added. \n“Even for the biggest football stars in the world there is a big rule: Playing well for your club comes first, don’t let all the other stuff catch the limelight. That is my advice.” \nPogba was again unable to inspire United to victory on Saturday as they slumped to a 1-1 draw against Stoke on Saturday, thanks to a 94th minute Wayne Rooney equaliser.
