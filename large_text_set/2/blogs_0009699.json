'Tone and culture' \nThe Church announced a new position on sexuality last month, stating that marriage in church should remain the lifelong union of a man and a woman. \nThe intervention, in an open letter from the former bishops, is seen as unusual. \nThe retired bishops, including former bishops of Oxford, Leicester and Newcastle, said sexuality had been a \"long-standing source of concern and contention\". \nIt follows a three-year process in which clergy and lay people held private discussions around the country about their attitudes to sexuality. \nThe letter to serving bishops said: \"Our perception is that while the pain of LGBT people is spoken about in your report, we do not hear its authentic voice. \n\"The result is that focus on the issue of a change in the law is that your call for a change in tone and culture, while absolutely right, does not carry conviction.\" 'Take-note' debate \nOne of the signatories to the letter is the former Bishop of Worcester, the Rt Rev Peter Selby. \nHe said: \"The people who entered those conversations who were gay or lesbian or had had various difficult experiences in their lives because of their sexuality, they entered those conversations knowing that they would have to reveal themselves in a circumstance in which that might carry a price in terms of their life and their career. \n\"They feel that what's come out here is a betrayal in the specific sense. \n\"All sorts of ideas are in this report about what they would have wanted, which I don't think are accurate.\" \nThe general synod will debate the new position on sexuality on Wednesday. \nIt will hold a \"take-note\" debate, meaning synod is not asked formally to approve or reject the policy. \nSome members of synod have said they are hoping to vote against it. \nA Church of England spokesman said: \"The purpose of the shared conversations process was not to change the view of participants or to seek to change the views of others, but rather to recognise Jesus in the face, story and view of those with whom they disagree. \n\"The 'take-note' debate at synod will be an opportunity for those with differing opinions on this issue to have their views aired.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:59:11.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
