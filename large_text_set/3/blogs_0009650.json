A preview of the show is available now on iTunes . <!--iframe--> \nS-Town started after a listener, John, reached out to long-time This American Life producer Brian Reed about a rumored murder in his rural Alabama town. He asked Reed to help investigate the son of a wealthy family who, according to John, had been bragging that he got away with murder. \nBut then, someone else died, and more mysteries about a feud and treasure emerged. So you might want to take the long way home that Tuesday. \n“ S-Town is totally different from anything I’ve heard before,” says executive producer Julie Snyder. “Since we first announced the series, I’ve seen a lot of speculation that we’re doing a ‘true crime’ show, but I don’t think that does S-Town justice. It’s just a story that goes beyond any expectations.” \nReed, who spent more than three years reporting the story, serves as host of the podcast, which will be told in chapters. It's the first show to come out of Serial Productions, the new production company from Serial co-creators Sarah Koenig and Julie Snyder, and This American Life creator and host Ira Glass. \nBrian Reed, right, hosts 'S-Town,' a serialized nonfiction podcast that premieres March 28.
