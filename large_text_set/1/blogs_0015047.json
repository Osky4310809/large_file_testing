Shankar said Pakistan has been deprived of international cricket in last many years and called for a resumption of international cricket in Pakistan. \nThings are quite good for competitive international cricket and our tour ended in a smooth manner and we do not see any problem here as far as security is concerned he said. \nThe Malaysian team manager said Pakistan has a rich cricket history which is evident from its achievements at international level and it produced many big players of the game. \nIt is unfortunate that international cricket is not being played in Pakistan which has damaged the cause of cricket in Pakistan and it is in the larger interest of Pakistan that international cricket should resume here as early as possible he said adding if there will be no international cricket in the country there will be fewer opportunities for the young players to learn and to compete with the top notch of the world cricket in their own backyard. \nHe said it was an honour for his team to play at the famous Gaddafi Stadium and his team learnt a lot during the tour and got needed exposure and experience for its coming assignments in near future. \nCoach Bilal Asad, a former first class Pakistani player endorsed the views of the manager and said there is no security issue in Pakistan to play cricket. \nThings are perfect here for staging and playing international cricket and there is mindset which talks about security issues here in Pakistan which are not correct he said adding Before the start of the tour we faced the similar propaganda on security concerns but we did not consider it and finalised our tour to Pakistan for learning and betterment of our team keeping an eye on its future commitments. \nBoth the team officials expressed their gratitude to Pakistan Cricket Board for hosting the Malaysian team and the hospitality extended to it during the tour. 0 0 Malaysian cricket team officials term Pakistan a safe country   17,   17,   Cricket, Geo   Malaysia, Pakistan, Sport, Sport News.   \"Malaysian cricket team officials term Pakistan a safe country\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/127592-Malaysian-cricket-team-officials-term-Pakistan-a-safe-country+GeoSport- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:07:35.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
