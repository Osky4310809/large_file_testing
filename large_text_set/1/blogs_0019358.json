On Saturday, Liverpool conceded three goals at Anfield for only the second time under Klopp as they lost 3-2 to lowly Swansea City in the Premier League, a defeat that has seen them drop to fourth, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea. If it was that easy to buy one player then all the problems are solved, I would be silly not to do it.” Liverpool have never lost when Matip has played and the 25-year-old seems likely to return to central defence on Wednesday following his problems with injury and international clearance.
