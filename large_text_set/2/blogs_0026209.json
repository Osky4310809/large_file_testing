The actress chose a full length, sheer, beaded Alexander McQueen number to wear on the red carpet at the 19th Costume Designers Guild Awards and we are obsessed. With bright, exuberant and vibrant kaleidoscope motifs woven onto the dress, Lily looks like a walking mandala, balancing looking trippy and fashionable in the perfect way. The peek-a-boo play of the dress was another incredible accent, since the embellishments of the gown were sewn onto a sheer base, allowing the perfect amount of skin to make a statement.\nCatching the light in @AlexanderMcqueen... \nA post shared by Lily Collins (@lilyjcollins) on Feb 21, 2017 at 7:35pm PST \nLily chose to coordinate her dress with her hair slicked way back (her bold brows in perfect view) and a perfect muave stained lip. The gown did all of the talking, with the kaleidoscope pattern fading into tendrils and blooms before forming a beautiful border at the hem. McQueen is known for his bold designs that play between light and dark, and this gown is no different.\nAllen Berezovsky/Getty We love the avocado green, crimson reds and violets that this dress shows off. Even more than that, we love how it looks like wearable art, like a high fashion picture frame for Lily to shine in a new light. And with a sheer back and the perfect black back seam, we really can’t get enough.\nSteve Granitz/Getty Look back at it, Lily.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:22:35.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
