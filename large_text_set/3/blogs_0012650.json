It’s possible, since Adele has a secret Twitter account , Mashable reports. Her management stopped Adele from accessing her official account, but the “ When We Were Young ” singer simply can’t resist the urge to drunk tweet (aka, the best worst idea ever), so she did what any social media addict would do: She created another account and didn’t tell her bosses.\nSo, how are we suddenly privy to this info? Well, this revelation is the latest in a series of Adele’s hilarious concert shenanigans wherein bats and mosquitoes crash her shows, and secrets come spilling forth during her impromptu chats with the audience.\nBasically, she spilled the beans herself because apparently she’s only good at remaining tight-lipped about specific bits of info, like her secret Twitter handle.\n\nvia GIPHY \n“I was looking on Twitter last night,” Adele told the crowd of concertgoers during her Tuesday night show in Brisbane, Australia. “They don’t know I have a secret account. Well obviously they do now because I said that. By ‘they’ I mean my management.” She added, “I’m not allowed access to my own Twitter because I’m quite mouthy and I say the wrong thing a lot of the time. So they took that privilege away from me.”\nDamn, Adele. We could only imagine some of the things you might drunkenly tweet, but we’re going to trust that your team has done the right thing by keeping your eager Twitter fingers away from the official account. But we pray they will NEVER censor your hilarious concert confessions, which give us SO much life.\n\nvia GIPHY \nBetween finding out Beyoncé’s secret Snapchat handle and uncovering Adele’s liquor-fueled Twitter account, we have our online investigative work cut out for us.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T17:28:19.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
