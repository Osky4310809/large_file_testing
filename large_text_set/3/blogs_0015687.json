Music is all about communication, and what you listen to can signal to others what kind of connection you might be able to make with them. Apparently, psychologists have linked musical tastes to personality traits , but I also think that a person's musical tastes can reflect their politics or policy preferences. \nWhen people talk about politics and music, it's usually about the political views the musician is expressing, but what about the listeners? When someone bangs with \"Fuck tha Police,\" (by N.W.A or whatever cover version, including the one with Insane Clown Posse), doesn't that reflect a general position that the individual feels strongly about? Music as political reflection is why I can't enjoy vapourwave and future funk anymore, because these musical genres have been hijacked by fascists . \nWhich brings me to the Conservative Party of Canada's ongoing leadership race. Fourteen candidates, and 14 playlists that may serve as a reflection of their personality and worldview. Which is great because, although I pay quite a lot of attention to Canadian politics, I can name only like four or five of these candidates off the top of my head. To me, their individual policy proposals, ranging from racism to tax cuts , have all kind of fused and churned with each other into this amorphous political blob of an agenda. Music might make it easier to identify each candidate's vision for Canada and the Conservative Party. \nTo better know who these CPC leadership candidates are and where they want to take the country, I asked each one to send me a playlist of their favourite music. Maybe their most played on Spotify will reveal some trenchant insight into their desires for Canadian public administration? Only half of all the candidates got back to me on the request, but even that handful of tuneage provided lots to dig into.

Samson - \"When I Write My Master's Thesis\" The Weakerthans - \"Sun in an Empty Room\" Rheostatics - \"Saskatchewan\" Arcade Fire - \"Ready to Start\" Drake - \"Hotline Bling\" Gordon Lightfoot - \"Carefree Highway\" Tragically Hip - \"Bobcaygeon\" \nChris Alexander's offers quite the CanCon playlist, save for the one Lin-Manuel track that's arguably one of the least hip-hop in all of Hamilton . It's basically mp3 rips from compilation albums for the Juno Awards, demonstrating Alexander's true patriot love for Canadian artists. Too bad none of his campaign promises reflect Richard Desjardins' environmental activism or Gord Downie's thoughts on First Nations reconciliation for residential schools. As an Arcade Fire fan, you'd think he would also be a fan of expanding foreign aid to places like Haiti, right? But we actually don't seem to get any of that in his campaign promises.

The addition of AC/DC and U2 is mostly symptomatic of being from a late-boomer age, when times were simpler and \"foreigners\" didn't cover their faces .

A modest mix for the moderate Conservative. Photo by Jake Kivanc", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:11:18.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
