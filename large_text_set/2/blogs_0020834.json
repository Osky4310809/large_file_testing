Credit: NASA / JHUAPL / SwRI It’s taken a year and a half, but the International Astronomical Union and the science team behind NASA’s New Horizons mission have finally struck a deal for naming the features on Pluto and its moons.\nThe agreement, announced today, will open the way for the already well-known “informal” names for places on Pluto, such as Tombaugh Regio and Sputnik Planum, to become formal.\nIt also allows for fictional characters and locales, ranging from Mordor in “Lord of the Rings” to Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock from the Star Trek saga, to be officially associated with features on Charon, Pluto’s biggest moon.\nThe scheme is mostly based on names that were suggested even before New Horizons flew past Pluto on July 14, 2015, as part of the SETI Institute’s “Our Pluto” campaign. The IAU and the New Horizons team agreed on a few tweaks to the categories for Pluto and Charon.\nNow the New Horizons team will go ahead and submit dozens of names for the IAU’s approval, in accordance with the international body’s longstanding procedures.\n“I’m very happy with both the process and partnership that New Horizons and the IAU undertook that led to wonderful, inspiring and engaging naming themes for surface features on Pluto and its moons,” the New Horizons mission’s principal investigator, Alan Stern, said in today’s announcement.\nThe IAU’s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature will work with Stern and his colleagues to sign off on the formal names.\n“I am very pleased that the close collaboration of the WGPSN with the New Horizons Team led to these beautiful, inspirational categories for naming the features on Pluto and its satellites,” said Rita Schulz, who’s in charge of the working group. “We are ready now for receiving the proposals for names. Good things take time, but it will be worth it.”\nHere are the themes that have been approved for naming features on Pluto and its moons:\nPluto \n● Gods, goddesses and other beings associated with the underworld from mythology, folklore and literature\n● Names for the underworld and for underworld locales from mythology, folklore and literature\n● Heroes and other explorers of the underworld\n● Scientists and engineers associated with Pluto and the Kuiper Belt\n● Pioneering space missions and spacecraft\n● Historic pioneers who crossed new horizons in the exploration of the Earth, sea and sky\nCharon \n● Destinations and milestones of fictional space and other exploration\n● Fictional and mythological vessels of space and other exploration\n● Fictional and mythological voyagers, travelers and explorers\n● Authors and artists associated with space exploration, especially Pluto and the Kuiper Belt\nThemes for Pluto’s smaller moons are: \n• Styx : River gods\n• Nix : Deities of the night\n• Kerberos : Dogs from literature, mythology and history\n• Hydra : Legendary serpents and dragons", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:31:51.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
