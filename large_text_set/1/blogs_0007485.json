The decision was unanimous. BREAKING: Dylann Roof sentenced to death for killing 9 black church members; 1st to get death penalty for federal hate crimes. \n— The Associated Press (@AP) January 10, 2017 \nAfter being found guilty of the murders in December, Roof chose to represent himself to the jurors tasked with deciding his fate. Insisting that “ there’s nothing wrong with me psychologically ,” he asked the court to disregard his lawyer’s earlier attempts to portray him as mentally unstable. \nDuring Roof’s closing remarks , he was unapologetic about his crimes, telling the court “I felt like I had to do it, and I still feel like I had to do it.” Roof also appeared non-committal about his pending sentence, saying, “I have the right to ask you to give me a life sentence. I don’t know what good that will do anyway.” \nUpon learning of the verdict, Roof’s family issued a brief statement.

He reportedly asked for new, court-ordered legal representation during this process. Roof may be planning to appeal his sentence , which is allowed in federal death penalty cases. If he does, it is unclear how long that process might last. \nRoof is the first person to be given a federal death penalty since Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was sentenced last year for his role in the Boston Marathon bombings.
