At right are Alveda King, Ivanka Trump and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) . (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst) A month into office, President Trump still frequently touts his election victory and often does so at unexpected moments. It happened again Tuesday when the president boasted of a win in South Carolina by “double, double, double digits” as he wrapped up a tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\nTrump made the statement as he was acknowledging those who accompanied him on the tour of the Smithsonian Institution museum, including Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), one of three African Americans in the Senate and the only one who is a Republican.\n[ Trump visits the National Museum of African American History and Culture ]\n“ I also want to thank Senator Tim Scott for joining us today -- friend of mine, a great, great senator from South Carolina,” Trump said, adding: “I like the state of South Carolina. I like all those states where I won by double, double, double digits. You know, those states.”\nIt’s unclear if Trump was talking about the general or primary election -- or what exactly the definition of a “double, double, double digits” victory might be.\nFor the record, in the general election, Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in South Carolina by just more than 15 points -- 55.9 percent to 40.7 percent.\nIn a multi-candidate Republican primary in South Carolina, Trump prevailed with 32.5 percent of the vote -- about 10 points more than the second-place finisher, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@WPJohnWagner"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:23:59.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
