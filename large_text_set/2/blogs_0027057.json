This consortium aims to invest $250 million in Jolla to help develop this product. This news comes a few months after Jolla revealed that Sailfish had become the first mobile OS to receive domestic certification for corporate use by the government of Russia .\nBoth of these developments, combined with news that Sony’s Xperia phones will soon be officially compatible with Sailfish, could make the OS a more viable competitor to Android, especially in those large markets of Russia and China.
