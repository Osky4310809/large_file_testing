King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 20 hours ago 6 \nDiscussing his debut solo album \"Crystal Machete,\" Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland said he's been feeling disconnected from heavy music for quite a long time. \nHe tells Total Guitar : \"I've not liked heavy music for a long time, and moved further away from it as I've gotten older. I've been less interested in the 'band' thing. I found myself not really listening to bands anymore, but soundtracks instead. So this was an album made of irritation, to be honest. \n\"Being irritated with music that's so in your face and invasive, with loud guitars and loud vocals. Things that demand your attention. When I'm painting or being creative, I don't want to listen to music that's like that. And as an artist, I don't want to be an angry kid going, 'Me me me!' I stopped listening to music like that, and whenever I do get the bug, I find it doesn't last long...\" \nThe guitarist added later during the chat: \"I've never really even felt like a guitar player. Like, I've always admired other guys, but I've never felt like one myself. It's weird when people think I'm one of the master architects of something I really didn't listen to at all. That sounds like I'm being negative, but I've never felt comfortable seeing myself in that way. I prefer being more of a collage artist - a jack of all trades, master of none type of person.\" \nAsked on which artists are his strongest influences right now, Wes replied: \"Godspeed You! Black Emperor are a band that I've listened to for a long time and have been a big guide to me. Aphex Twin's 'Selected Ambient Works 2' is one of my favorite albums of all time, it's also a big tent pole in me wanting to move in this direction. Even earlier stuff by The Cure, like ' Disintegration ,' ' Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me ' with really long building intros, for 5 or 6 minutes, before vocals come in and everything begins. \n\"I think we're living in the post-apocalyptic music industry... If you don't have many cans in the shelter, there's no food. \n\"It's that sense of taking your time. I think we're living in the post-apocalyptic music industry, in a lot of ways... I'm really lucky because I get to play in Limp Bizkit, who collected a lot of cans and I get to eat from those cans. But right now, if you don't have many cans in the shelter, there's no food for you. And no one's really figuring out how to grow their own food. \n\"We're making records like the guys on the Titanic who played their instruments while the ship was sinking. So I just want to enjoy music before it all disappears. I think this is the end time for musicians, things aren't gonna get better. The future of entertainment will not include artists, the job of the musician is not gonna be there any more.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:34:00.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
