Ted Kravitz joins James Galloway trackside to wrap up the first test in Barcelona and look at which teams are emerging as contenders \nOnce the problem was fixed late in the morning, Hamilton decided to give what was left of the session over to Valtteri Bottas with the Finn due in the car for the afternoon in any case. \nBottas still completed 68 laps and finished eighth fastest, with Mercedes ending the week with the quickest overall time and the most number of laps completed. \nMax Verstappen posted his best time of the test to take second for Red Bull, with Sergio Perez third for Force India and Stoffel Vandoorne, despite use of the ultrasofts late on, seventh for McLaren. Jolyon Palmer ended the test third for Renault. \nMore to follow... \nThe second F1 pre-season test starts on Tuesday March 7 and the Sky Sports F1 Digital team will be providing live commentary from dawn until dusk on all four days while Sky Sports News HQ will also deliver live updates from trackside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T19:36:41.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
