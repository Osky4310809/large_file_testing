A ‚Äúrocket ship‚Äù icon has popped up in the app of select users worldwide, adjacent to the News Feed button. Its appearance is prompting a lot of users to wonder, ‚Äúwhat on earth is this thing?‚Äù \nThe button may be either at the top of the screen or the bottom, depending on whether the user is on iOS or Android. What has Facebook done now? üò§ I already really dislike that marketplace crap. Now what's this rocket icon thing??? pic.twitter.com/l0obKojCJH \n‚Äî Amanda Clinton (@Amanda_Clinton) March 4, 2017 \n  rocket ship icon is just the latest in Facebook‚Äôs ongoing experiments in presenting an alternate News Feed to users ‚Äì one that consists of posts, articles, photos and videos from sources you haven‚Äôt followed, like Facebook Pages or posts news media organizations, for example. \nWhile you might not be actively tracking these sources, Facebook believes it‚Äôs content that you‚Äôll like. The items displayed in the ‚Äúrocket ship‚Äù feed come from Pages that are similar to those you‚Äôve already liked, as well as those that are popular with your friends ‚Äì like a video that many people in your network are watching, for instance. \nThis is not a new experiment ‚Äì Facebook was recently spotted testing an alternative News Feed, but was using a different icon (a small square) at the time. That test was also limited to Android beta users, according to reports . A similar earlier test on iOS actually labeled the second feed with the word ‚ÄúExplore.‚Äù \nThe new experiment with the rocket ship, however, is appearing in the mobile version of Facebook across both iOS and Android platforms, including those who have not opted into a beta. \nDespite Facebook‚Äôs advanced algorithms designed to keep users engaged and endlessly scrolling ‚Äì and its understanding of what a user has liked, watched, and clicked ‚Äì the company has not heavily focused its efforts on helping users connect more broadly with interests through recommended content. Instead, today‚Äôs News Feed is filled with content a user has explicitly liked, whether that‚Äôs friends‚Äô posts or updates from Pages users are following. \nBut Facebook has always wanted to have a better angle into people‚Äôs interests ‚Äì especially as other networks (like Twitter) have made it easier to follow news and topics, and not just people, brands, and businesses.
