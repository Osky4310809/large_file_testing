We cannot be disposed to good healthcare or proper feeding in an atmosphere of conflict. We, therefore, appeal to leaders and followers to respect lives and embrace lasting peace.” \nResponding at Aladja, shortly after flagging off the free health care, President-General of Udu Kingdom, Chief Steve Sokoh, said: “Aladja and Udu Kingdom in general have always been peaceful and we have resolved to sustain that peace with our neighbour. We expect Ogbe-Ijoh and Isaba to do same. \n“Above all, we call on the Delta State Government to exercise the will and sincerity to implement the report of the Prof. Abednego Ekoko peace commission it set up to find lasting solution to our boundary disagreement with our Ijaw neighbours and the truth shall heal all the wounds.” \nThe foundation, which provided medicare to people with skin conditions, gastritis, hypertension, diabetes, and other ailments, also visited and appealed to monarchs of the warring communities to use their thrones to promote peace in their domains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:02:37.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
