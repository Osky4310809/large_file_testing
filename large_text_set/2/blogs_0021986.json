Sources revealed, yesterday, that the victims were kidnapped on Tuesday. \nIt was gathered that the gunmen, who came through the lagoon around 9a.m., shot sporadically before they took the two dredgers away in their speedboat. \nIt was gathered that those abducted were the dredging company’s manager and the machine operator. According to a source, one of the workers was hit on the arm by bullets, while trying to escape. \nThe source said: “We were in our various houses when we heard gunshots. After the dust had settled, we went to the scene. Unfortunately, we found one of the workers in a pool of his blood. \n“We took him to a private clinic in the community, after which we then reported the matter at the Akodo Police Division. \n“It was when we got to the clinic that we realised it was kidnappers that invaded the dredging site. We call on government and the security agencies to come to our aid.” \nIt was further gathered that the dredging company was said to have started operation in the community in January. \nThe Lagos State Commissioner of Police was called upon to deploy marine police personnel to the riverine areas of the state. \n“On that fateful day, if some marine police personnel were stationed in the coastal area, the gunmen would probably have been arrested,” another source said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:28:34.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
