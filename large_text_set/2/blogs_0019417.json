Bush, some of whose policies I also found troubling, and I took part in programs that the Obama administration criticized and ended.”\nAs intelligence professionals, we’re taught to tune out politics\n“As intelligence professionals, we’re taught to tune out politics.” \nHe added that Trump’s campaign rhetoric combined with some of his initial moves in the White House led to his decision.\n“I watched in disbelief when, during the third presidential debate, Trump casually cast doubt on the high-confidence conclusion of our 17 intelligence agencies, released that month, that Russia was behind the hacking and release of election-related emails,” Price writes. “Trump’s actions in office have been even more disturbing.”\nPrice specifically criticizes Trump’s speech in front of a memorial wall at CIA headquarters the day after taking office in which he defended the size of his inauguration crowd.\n“Whether delusional or deceitful, these were not the remarks many of my former colleagues and I wanted to hear from our new commander in chief,” Price wrote. “I couldn’t help but reflect on the stark contrast between the bombast of the new president and the quiet dedication of a mentor — a courageous, dedicated professional — who is memorialized on that wall. \n“I know others at CIA felt similarly.”\nThe president’s trusted White House advisers, not career professionals, reportedly have final say over what intelligence reaches his desk\nHe also cites Trump’s reorganization of the National Security Council last month, which has been seen as a downgrade in influence for intelligence officials. Eventually the White House caved and reluctantly put the CIA director back as a principal on that council. \nPrice says that’s indicative of the new administration’s attitude towards intelligence agencies: “It has little need for intelligence professionals who, in speaking truth to power, might challenge the so-called “America First” orthodoxy that sees Russia as an ally and Australia as a punching bag. \nRelated Former CIA director James Woolsey quits Donald Trump’s transition team because he’s been ignored: sources Donald Trump calls NATO ‘obsolete’ as outgoing CIA chief lectures president-elect over tweets, Russia “That’s why the president’s trusted White House advisers, not career professionals, reportedly have final say over what intelligence reaches his desk.”\nPrice worked at the CIA since 2006. He was also a staffer at the NSC from 2014 to earlier this year.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:53:41.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
