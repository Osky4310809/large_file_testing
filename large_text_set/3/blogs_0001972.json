The game was paused momentarily for an injury delay, and Asuaje was lifted for pinch-runner Nate Easley. \nNaturally, Asuaje's mom was concerned for her son. So, she did what any mom would do: She went straight to the source, tweeting at the Padres to find out if her son was all right. \n\"Is Carlos Asuaje OK?\" she asked. \"This is his mother.\" \nHer inquiring tweet has since been deleted (you can see the text of it here ), but after the social media team inquired with the Padres, Asuaje's mom received the answer she was hoping for: @ciafrei he is just fine. He left the game as part of a normal substitution �� - San Diego Padres (@Padres) March 2, 2017 \nHey, moms are supposed to make sure you're always OK, even when you're playing professional baseball. \nAnd with that, hopefully Asuaje's mom can rest easy knowing her son is OK, and he Asuaje can get back to doing what he does best -- playing for the Padres and enjoying the company of puppies: Photo day means puppies. @TherealAsuaje20 is a fan #PadresST pic.twitter.com/LZmYpum1gE - San Diego Padres (@Padres) February 19, 2017 This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs. more from cut4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T05:49:12.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
