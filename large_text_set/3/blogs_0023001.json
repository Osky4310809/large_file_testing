Next Wednesday, the Government will deliver on that decision and formally start the process by triggering Article 50. \nWe are on the threshold of the most important negotiation for this country for a generation. The Government is clear in its aims: a deal that works for every nation and region of the UK and indeed for all of Europe – a new, positive partnership between the UK and our friends and allies in the European Union.
