Chelsea could give Sanchez more money without having to move to China (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nWenger has also made it clear that a lot of Ozil’s talks have been about wanting trophies as well as money and the uncertainty is being felt throughout the club. \nDespite completing the most difficult stage of paying for the Emirates Stadium, the club is still run on a tight budget and it is unlikely they would stretch to £250,000 a week for their two biggest stars. \nArsenal face worries over a raft of first-team players who have 18 months left on their current deals, including Oxlade-Chamberlain, Wilshere and England full-back Kieran Gibbs. \nThat is part of why they are being kept waiting on deals, as the club want to keep the books in order. Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere may have to wait until the Gunners' big two decide (Photo: Arsenal FC via Getty) \nThey are set to trigger extensions for Santi Cazorla and Per Mertesacker, but know the squad is looking closely at the talks with star men Ozil and Sanchez. \nWenger and the hierarchy know that if they break the bank for that pair, then other big names could also come back asking for pay-rises. \nThey recently managed to secure full-back Hector Bellerin – a target for Man City and former club Barcelona – on a six-year contract worth around £100,000 a week. \nArsenal have been eyeing Borussia Dortmund’s Marco Reus as a potential replacement if they have to sell either Ozil or Sanchez in the summer, but they cannot press ahead with that until they know the outcome of the talks. Possible replacement Reus may not be needed if Ozil and Sanchez DO stay (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nWenger himself is also out of contract this summer. \nThere is a two-year deal worth £8million a year on the table waiting to be signed. \nBut the Frenchman knows if Arsenal lose a big star and finish outside the top four the fans could react badly, and that adds to the doubts over whether he will put pen to paper. poll loading Will Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil sign new deals? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:45:45.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
