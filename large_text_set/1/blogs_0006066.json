Today would have been Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy’s 51st birthday in a beautiful life cut tragically short. A fashion icon in her own right when she married the handsome John F. Kennedy Jr., Bessette was also a publicist for Calvin Klein, and her minimal and understated aesthetic aligned perfectly with the brand. Her wedding dress by Narciso Rodriguez may be one of the most sought-after gowns of all time. She hands-down changed the wedding dress game—making it acceptable and desirable to wear something refined and simple: a white silk slip rather than princess-y tulle and an embellished gown. \nHer everyday style was equally pared down and painfully consistent—so consistent, we still associate button-downs, pencil skirts, and Manolo’s with Bessette, especially when worn together. She was the mold for what is now the “fashion editor” outfit and perfected it to a T. She taught us that classic silhouettes, clean lines, and solid colors never get old. And, last but not least, she reconfirmed that quiet, confident taste never goes unnoticed. Today, on January 7, we celebrate seven of Bessette’s most iconic looks that we still want to replicate for years to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T01:00:56.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
