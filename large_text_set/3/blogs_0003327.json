Liverpool legend Fowler scored 163 times in the Premier League (Photo: Reuters) \nGMP Middleton clearly caught wind of Fowler's tweet and responded on Thursday morning, writing: \"Seems we upset Robbie Fowler yesterday. Come for a tour of the station & if you're good put the blue lights on a Police car as an apology.\" \nThe Anfield favourite then tweeted: \"Honestly you never (upset me)... But starting to now by not understanding my sending you a joke to combat yours..\" \nThe Middleton force accepted Fowler was joking and then extended the offer of a ride along to the 163-goal ex-Premier League marksman. \nWe wonder if Fowler will accept that offer. Probably not. Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T12:27:16.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
