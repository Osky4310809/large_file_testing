Kane was unable to continue and was replaced by Christian Eriksen \nKane did manage to walk off the pitch and down the tunnel unaided, but his withdrawal will be a major cause for concern for Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino. \nThe 23-year-old could also be a doubt for England's forthcoming internationals with Germany and Lithuania, with manager Gareth Southgate set to announce his squad on Thursday. \nKane, who has scored 24 goals in 28 appearances for Tottenham this season, missed just under two months of the season with an ankle ligament injury suffered in the 1-0 victory over Sunderland in September.
