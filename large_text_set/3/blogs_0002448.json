WGC-Mexico Championship: Articles, photos and videos \nAccording to PGA Tour rules official Stephen Cox, who made the ruling, Mickelson’s ball was picked up by a fan and moved from the spot where it had come to rest. \nAfter confirming with numerous sources in the crowd that Mickelson’s golf ball had been moved, Cox said the only thing he really had to determine was where it had been picked up, which was from a forward tee of the adjacent ninth hole. \nMickelson was allowed to drop where his golf ball originally was and he made an impressive par on the hole. \nLefty also needed rulings on Nos. 11 and 12 after wayward tee shots, but he still managed to post an under-par round (68).
