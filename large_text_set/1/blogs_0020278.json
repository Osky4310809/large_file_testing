A photo posted by therock (@therock) on Sep 20, 2016 at 8:29am PDT \nSome pointed out that Gillan's character was wearing a significantly revealing and sexualized outfit, especially compared to her male co-stars. But in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter , Gillan explained that the photo doesn't tell the full story. \n“I’ve experienced something similar when I worked on Doctor Who and there was such an uproar about my costume when that was first revealed, so I thought it was happening all over again,” she told THR . \nEarly photos of Gillan on Doctor Who -- where she played companion Amy Pond from 2010-2013 -- showed her in a British police uniform with a very short skirt, which drew criticism. In the actual show it was revealed she wasn't a police officer but rather a \"kiss-o-gram.\" \nGillan went on to say that the Jumanji costume also has a deeper meaning. \n“But I have to say, I’d never take on a role that was truly gratuitous for no reason.\" she said. \"There’s a really valid reason why she’s wearing that. My character is really not happy about it!” Jumanji! Yes I'm wearing child sized clothes and YES there is a reason! The pay off is worth it, I promise! #Jumanji pic.twitter.com/qBshnhwV6K — Karen Gillan (@karengillan) September 21, 2016 \nThe film is set to hit theaters Dec. 22.
