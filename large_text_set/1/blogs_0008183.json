NOY MORCOSO/INQUIRER.net \nFormer senator Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr. appeared at the Sandiganbayan on Thursday for the first day of his plunder trial over the alleged pork barrel scam. \nDressed in a jacket over a purple polo shirt, Revilla arrived at about 8 a.m. \nHis chief of staff Richard Cambe also arrived for his trial, also for plunder.
