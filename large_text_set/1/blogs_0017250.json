He’s going to. He’s that good.” Thon Maker. Source: Getty Images \nMaker’s wingspan, unique skillset, and size have always intrigued front office executives, but, on a relatively deep Bucks team, he’s struggled to see minutes. \nParker suggested that, if Maker was on a team that wasn’t vying for a playoff spot, he’d earn more minutes and post more significant numbers. \n“Say if, for instance, he was on a team like Philly or one of the teams that’s in the low .500s, he’d be averaging 15 and 10, easily, because his skillset is so amazing,” Parker said. \n“He can shoot the ball, he can put it on the ground, and he’s athletic. he has that time of athleticism Quick first step for his size, agile, great hands, good feel for the game, and it’s only going to get better.” \nIn an odd series of events, Maker replaced Parker in the starting lineup after these comments; a reaction to the Bucks’ four-game losing streak.
