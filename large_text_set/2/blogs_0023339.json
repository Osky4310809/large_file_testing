By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 24, 2017 3:28 PM BMC Election Results 2017: Nitin Gadkari believes that Devendra Fadnavis and Uddhav Thackeray will take the sensible decision. (Source: PTI) \nBMC Election Results 2017: Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena battled hard to win the Mumbai civic polls so that they can govern the biggest and richest civic body in Asia but after the results were out one of the parties were able to get a clear majority as Sena won 84 seats while BJP got 82 seats. In the weeks leading to the elections, both the parties attacked each other multiple times and ruled out the possibility of forming an alliance but after Nitin Gadkari’s remarks, it looks like BJP is set to soften its stand. The Union Minister on Friday said that there is ‘no option’ for BJP but to join hands with Shiv Sena. \n“The situation now is that both parties have no option but to come together again. The final decision on this issue has to be taken by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray . Both are mature and I am sure they will take the right decision. I feel leaders of both parties have to take a decision, showing sujh bujh (understanding) and maturity” he said. \nHe singled out Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ for its targeting of PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah . “If there has to be a friendship with us (BJP), then there has to be a check on the writings in Saamana. How will there be friendship when Saamana, on a daily basis, writes insulting things about the PM and our party president? I feel that had these things been avoided, there would not have been so much bitterness between BJP and Sena” he said. \nYou may also want to watch: \nBefore the elections, Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray had spoken against the demonetisation drive citing the problems faced by the common man. Later, after weeks of silence on the part of BJP, the party had released a cartoon video, calling Shiv Sena as the “Khau Sena” and criticised it for its corrupt activities.Yesterday, Nitin Gadkari looked very happy with BJP’s performance and congratulated party workers. “For the first time, BJP has got such unprecedented success. I congratulate Maharashtra CM &BJP workers,” he had said. \nThe BJP improved its 2012 BMC poll performance by leaps and bounds, winning 82 seats, just two less than Sena. Both the parties are short of the magic figure of 114 needed to control the civic body. The BJP also led the seat tally in elections to 25 zilla parishads and 283 panchayat samitis in Maharashtra, which have traditionally been strongholds of Congress and NCP.
