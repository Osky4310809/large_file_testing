This is an absolutely horrible idea that could undermine the future of the sport itself. Mar 23, 2017 12:42 PM \n“Replay change still requires approval from 24 owners” \nOwners need to vote in order to overturn a play? Insanity… intrafinesse says: Mar 23, 2017 12:46 PM \n>>Which means either that Goodell knows he has the votes, or that he’s using an eleventh-hour media blitz to help deliver votes from those who also employ and pay him. \nI doubt Goodell would try to go around the owners. He’s probably politically astute, at least when it comes to dealing with the owners. lewsblues says: Mar 23, 2017 12:47 PM \nConsider this key sentence: “Instead of a fixed sideline monitor, we will bring a tablet to the Referee who can review the play…. \nthat will work really well in the rain and the snow …. jag1959 says: Mar 23, 2017 12:56 PM \nHard to believe Goodell would go off reservation. There has to be at least a plurality if not a majority of votes behind this for commissioner $ock puppet to have gone public with it. If it can’t be modified to have final say belong to a game site replay official let’s pray there’s at least enough enlightened self interest at work for it to be a legit official making the call from NY. The owners would be shooting themselves in the foot going along with it as presented. Fans that are already concerned about the integrity of game results are going to have no faith in one of the league’s minions having final say.
