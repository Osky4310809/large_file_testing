Asked about the prospect of a sale midseason, Rangnick said it was not on the agenda. \n‚ÄúWe are not even thinking about letting him go,‚Äù was his response when quizzed on interest in the player, per Kicker (h/t Stephan Uersfeld of ESPN FC). TF-Images/Getty Images \nIt has been reported by Alex Richards of the Daily Mirror the Reds are looking at a potential ¬£20 million deal for the 25-year-old, while it's noted by Uersfeld that Arsenal and Juventus have also been linked with the midfielder. \nSpeculation about a potential exit was fuelled recently when the player‚Äôs agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, told Bild (h/t Uersfeld ) that he ‚Äúcan't promise that Emil will stay in Leipzig this winter.‚Äù \nThe RB Leipzig Twitter feed recently paid tribute to their man, who has been the most creative player in German football‚Äôs top flight so far this season: Emil #Forsberg : the assist king üëë of the #Bundesliga !

For Liverpool, he‚Äôd potentially thrive in the fluid attacking setup that manager Jurgen Klopp has sought to utilise during the 2016-17 season. \nNonetheless, Leipzig are evidently unwilling to cash in on one of their star men. The club are seeking to establish themselves among the elite names in the Bundesliga and have a fine chance of securing a European place in their first-ever season in the top flight. Moving on Forsberg midseason would be a significant blow to their chances of doing so. Marseille Join Reds in Gregoire Defrel Pursuit ANDER GILLENEA/Getty Images \nAccording to L‚ÄôEquipe (h/t Le10 Sport , via Edo Dalmonte of CalcioMercato.com), Liverpool and Roma are set to be rivalled by Marseille in the chase for Sassuolo striker Gregoire Defrel. \nIt‚Äôs suggested that Marseille boss Rudi Garcia isolated the forward as a target during his time at Roma and now wants to bring him to his new employers. However, Liverpool are also said to be in for the 25-year-old, who has been impressive up top for the Serie A side so far this season. \nHere is a look at what Defrel is capable of offering at his best: Share \nWhile he‚Äôs able to play on either flank and have an influence on the game, Defrel has primarily been utilised up top for Sassuolo so far this season. He‚Äôs impressed too, grabbing six goals and one assist in 18 appearances in Serie A. Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images Defrel's industry would appeal to Klopp. \nThere are areas of the Frenchman‚Äôs game that would appeal to Klopp. Aside from his aforementioned versatility, the striker is also an excellent foil for other attacking players due his strong hold-up play, and he's aggressive in his pressing off the ball. \nAs such, it‚Äôd be easy to see him settling at Anfield. However, according to the report, there‚Äôs little intention on the part of Sassuolo to part with such an important player halfway through the campaign. Even if they were, it appears Liverpool would have competition for his signature.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T13:56:59.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
